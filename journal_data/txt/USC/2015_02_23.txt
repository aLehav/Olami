On Monday night, environmental policy strategist Terry Tamminen spoke to students for the Environmental Student Assembly and the Schwarzenegger Institute’s second #ECOTALKS roundtable discussion.
Fifteen students with majors across multiple disciplines attended to hear Tamminen’s insights into the functions of public policies, business and communication as tools toward a cleaner environment at USC and in the world at large.
Tamminen served as former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency and is now a lead advisor to R20, a non-profit he and former governor Schwarzenegger established to educate subnational governments about policies, efficient technologies and financial models that would improve environmental conditions in those jurisdictions.
A common thread throughout the evening was that collaborations can and have brought success to stakeholders on the verge of loss when binary arguments are abandoned.
Tamminen’s numerous examples of effective partnerships included a decades-old anecdote about hundreds of people stopping their day’s activities to save JJ, the abandoned baby gray whale on the coast of Marina del Rey to recent explanations about how last year R20 led Brazil to begin upgrading its energy-inefficient and scarce city lighting.
R20 brought a manufacturer to Brazil create the LED lights in Brazil, allowed Brazil’s major utility company Eletrobas to certify the product to ensure that lights would properly function, and had the Brazilian Development Bank fund cities seeking to retrofit their street lights. Savings on lighting will allow cities to pay the bank back in five years.
“The taxpayer wins, local jobs are created by manufacturing and installations, they’re saving an average of 67 percent of the energy, so that’s a 67 percent reduction in greenhouse gases. We try to focus on those policy barriers between technology, finance, and policy that we can solve today,” Tamminen said.
Tamminen often cited contemporary examples of the dire consequences of environmental inaction — for example, a nearly totally realized drought holding São Paulo residents less than six months from evacuation. Tamminen responded to students’ inquiries by emphasizing the importance of prioritizing solutions that slow down damage the quickest.
Jack Koppa, a junior majoring in environmental studies and Chinese, asked how the possibility of future, more efficient technologies being discovered could impact current policy decision-making processes.
If we had fusion [technology] tomorrow, a lot of today’s problems wouldn’t be around.,” Koppa said. “But at the same time, you can’t wait for fusion to come.”
Tamminen raised the argument that the most immediately available technologies should be implemented, instead of allowing greenhouse gases to build.
“We’re dealing with greenhouses gases that our grandfathers put there by driving with their 1950s Chevrolet[s],” Tamminen said. “Every ton of carbon dioxide that we put into the atmosphere today is going to be with us a long time.”
In line with the conversation on collaborations, ESA Director Shawn Rhoads believes ESA’s popularity hinges on its alliances both within and outside USC, identifying #ECOTALKS as an example.
“We’ve been such a huge hit because of our partners’ motivation to join us and help us with our unique program,” Rhoads said. “Hosting these intimate roundtable discussions, it breaks traditional boundaries and it’s pushing for something new. We’re trying to bring in new ideas, new thoughts to address the important collaboration to bring environmental action to USC.”

From the classroom to the mayor’s office, a group of students had the opportunity to use their research to make an impact on local issues.
Students enrolled in POSC 395: Directed Governmental and Political Leadership Internship created policy recommendations on how to improve schools. The recommendations were presented to Mayor Garcetti at a conference at Oscar De La Hoya Ánimo Charter High School earlier this month.
The conference was hosted by Green Dot Public Schools’ United Parent organization, a group that informs families how to improve their communities and helps schools in the area, and invited USC students, parents and the mayor to come together to tour the school and discuss suggestions the students created based on research they conducted in the fall 2014 semester.
Each student in the POSC 395 course was placed into a group partnered with either Green Dot Public Schools, LA Metro or Caruso Affiliated. Students in the Green Dot Public School group were each assigned a topic related to education that they had to research.
Before entering into the research partnership, Green Dot schools were preparing for a conference with the mayor. After the research, students were invited to the conference to see their findings get presented.
Students’ work culminated in a final policy report; they synthesized their findings in a 10-page paper to Green Dot, along with a PowerPoint with their recommendations.
Laura Reilly, a sophomore majoring in policy, planning and development and political science, was given “Economic and Workforce Development” as her topic. In her research efforts, Laura reviewed the city of Los Angeles’ and Green Dot schools’ efforts to combat these issues. In addition, she looked at effective practices from other cities to see what sort of adjustment Los Angeles could make to better support students.
“I think it speaks to obvious economic principles,” Reilly said. “If the city is doing well economically, then the schools will do well because the resources are there. If overall investments are up, then people typically choose to invest more in schools.”
Larry Fondation, director of community engagement for Green Dot, helped the students through the process and instructed them with what the organization hoped to gain out of the research. Fondation developed topics for the students to research in order to come to the best policy recommendations. Veronica Toledo, also part of Green Dot schools, helped organize the conference with Larry.
Tina Fleming, a junior majoring in political science and psychology, analyzed how a minimum wage increase will affect students’ successes.
“For my topic, I examined the correlation between minimum wage and workforce development by researching the potential effects of Mayor Garcetti’s proposed minimum wage increase,” Fleming said. “Analyzing how an increase in the minimum wage will affect workers and their student’s success, and how small business and nonprofits will respond due to the increase in labor costs.”
The POSC 395 students worked remotely from campuses or libraries, and reviewed data online. Part of their research efforts was interview-based. Students met with partners at Green Dot schools and talked with community members who were part of the United Parents Assembly.
Samantha Levra, a junior majoring in sociology and political science, explained that talking to community members made the project more fulfilling.
“It was really cool to do a research project and actually see tangible results and see the people that my research will hopefully affect, versus other classes when you do research it’s kind of like for a project and for a grade and when it’s over you kind of forget about it,” Levra said. “It was cool to do research that will hopefully have a lasting impact.”

Troy Camp will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the L.A. Watts Riots at their annual gala on April 25. The event’s theme is “Troy Camp Through the Ages” and will feature a video made to document Troy Camp involvement in the community during this time, as well as the impact the riots had on the organization.
Troy Camp is a nonprofit student-run organization intended to provide programs for young students from local South Los Angeles schools. The main goal of the philanthropic organization is to provide the students with USC student mentors.
Otis Healy established Troy Camp in 1948, with the first camp in the summer of 1949. At that time, the camp consisted of fewer than 100 campers from the East L.A. Boys Club.
The Watts Riots took place in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles for six days in August 1965. The riots were fueled by racial tension, a part of the larger national civil rights movement. Though the riots occurred in a small area of the city, their powerful effects were felt throughout L.A. and the entire country.
Margie Buckingham, the 1970-1971 director, originally contacted current Troy Camp members with the idea of making a video commemorating Troy Camp’s involvement in the community during the Watts Riots.
“In 1965, the flashpoint for the Watts Riots was just right here next to campus,” Buckingham said. “Now, there is no cognizance. Young people haven’t been exposed to that information.”
Co-Executive Director Patrick Mazuca, a senior studying public relations and political science, has been involved in making the commemoration video.
“During that time, the university basically shut down, and nothing really happened,” Mazuca said. “But USC Troy Camp was still something that was going on, and through the outreach program they were able to at least get the kids away from the local community away the area for a while and make sure that the tradition and the Trojan Family was still continuing.”
Katherine Dorosk, a junior majoring in business administration, is the director of fundraising for Troy Camp and has led the project and planned the gala. She has met with several alumni to talk to them about their experiences within Troy Camp.
“They really stressed that on campus, everything seemed normal,” Dorosk said. “Besides the tanks that were in PSX, the university seemed to operate for its students, and they didn’t really notice a difference.”
Troy Camp members and alumni have already started filming the video and will continue to meet with different alumni to include more camp experiences. The original meeting with Troy Camp alumni from the 1960s and 1970s, according to Buckingham, brought out stories that she had never heard before.
“When you put everyone in a room, people start remembering different things, and then the energy starts flowing and then the laughter… We were there about three hours recording, and it was fabulous getting to hear all of these stories,” she said.
“That was really where the idea for this video came from — not only to celebrate the changes that our organization did for the community, but also how the community changed and reacted to the riots,” Dorosk said.
Since the Watts Riots, Troy Camp has changed dramatically. Now, campers come from 18 schools within a two-mile radius of campus, rather than from the Boys and Girls Club across the city. Troy Camp has expanded its programming to include hosting monthly events for elementary, middle and high school students in additions to the annual summer camp.
Despite these changes, John Ingram, co-executive director of Troy Camp, said that the current Troy Campers are still able to connect with alumni.
“What’s cool is really learning how similar their experiences are to ours and that on paper, our mission statement may have changed, but the whole energy and feel of Troy Camp has remained the same since the 1970s,” Ingram said.
The video will include interviews with Troy Camp alumni who were involved with the organization during the 1960s and 1970s. Old photographs, personal mementos and historical facts will also be included in the video. According to Katherine Dorosk, the executive board will put together a visual history of Troy Camp.

Dr. Angela Davis, a prominent political activist, spoke at Bovard Auditorium on Monday night about topics that ranged from the prison-industrial complex to racial injustice in the Academy Awards.
Davis is known for her involvement in the counterculture movement during the 1960s. Today, she advocates for social justice causes such as prison reform, racial equality and gender equality.
Dr. Michelle Turner, director of the Black Alumni Association, moderated the event and welcomed Davis.
“[She] has been one of the most iconic women in the struggle for blacks in this country,” Turner said.
Davis grew up in Birmingham, Alabama, and moved to New York during high school. She attributes her accomplishments and outlook on political involvement to her upbrining.
“I always thought of myself as a part of a community,” Davis said. “I never thought of myself as an isolated individual. It really was never about my becoming something that set me apart from everyone else. It was about using the knowledge that I acquired, using whatever talents and skills I had, to further the struggle for freedom.”
Her appearance at USC came on a day of special importance to Davis: the anniversary of her release on bail after two years in prison. She had been arrested on charges of murder, kidnapping and conspiracy and was released on Feb. 23, 1972. Davis’ incarceration garnered international attention, resulting in a worldwide campaign to have her released.
One of the current focuses of Davis’ activism is the reform of the prison-industrial complex and the incarceration of large numbers of black people. According to Davis, incarcerating more people is a profitable enterprise for  government and industry.
Davis also stressed the importance of viewing all social justice issues as interrelated. She mentioned domestic violence, mental illness and education disparity as components of a larger societal problem.
“I’m really interested in understanding connections, seeing ways in which all of the various social justice struggles that we’re involved in are connected, seeing the intersectionality of those struggles,” Davis said.
She did express her skepticism about what has been done to combat these social justice problems, however.
“I have a hard time accepting diversity as a synonym for justice. Diversity is a corporate strategy. It’s a strategy designed to ensure that the institution functions in the same way that it functioned before, except now that you now have some black faces and brown faces. It’s a difference that doesn’t make a difference,” Davis said.
Davis also offered a new outlook on race that she believes could revolutionize race relations in the United States by changing the system fundamentally.
She said colorblindness is not the solution to the problem of racism; instead, society should recognize inequalities and work to eliminate them.
“I see the role of colorblindness as being that of preventing people from understanding the depths of racism. Because racism is not simply about the color of an individual’s skin. It’s about structures of oppression and repression,” Davis said.
She encouraged students to continue pursuing their own interests in order to bring social change.
“We can never predict when change is going to come,” she said.
Angela Davis is not a “civil rights” leader.
Davis is right, colorblindness is not the solution to the problem of racism. When it comes to racial unity, color kindness will solve the problem. I can only hope Davis fully understands that racism today is a two way street where blacks are more racially prejudiced than whites. Where Is Love

The women’s swimming and diving team will compete in this weekend’s 2015 Pac-12 Championship meet after finishing fourth in the conference during the regular season.
The No. 12 Women of Troy (5-3, 4-3) will travel to the Weyerhauser King County Aquatic Center in Federal Way, Washington for the meet. It will take place between Wednesday, Feb. 25 until Saturday, Feb. 28.
The men’s diving team will also compete at the meet as the Pac-12 runs the diving championships concurrently with the women’s swimming championships. However, the men’s swimming championship does not begin until the following week on March 4.
The Women of Troy are led by redshirt senior platform diver and captain Haley Ishimatsu. The Seal Beach, California native is the two-time national diving champion. Originally from Duke, she transferred to USC after one collegiate season and began diving for the Women of Troy in 2013. Despite battling injuries in 2012, she competed for the U.S. national team at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, finishing 14th and 5th in the 10m and synchronized 10m, respectively.
She is the first woman to repeat as an NCAA diving champion since the 1992-1993 season, and if she can claim her third title this year in her third season with the Women of Troy, she will become the first ever to win three national championships in a row.
Other noteworthy Women of Troy set to compete in the competition are Andrea Kropp, a redshirt senior who swims the 200y breaststroke; junior All-American butterfly specialist Kendyl Stewart, Jasmine Tosky, a junior All-American, who predominantly competed in the individual medley; and Kasia Wilks, a junior All-American who swims freestyle.
The Pac-12 conference is arguably the toughest in the country, featuring five nationally ranked teams, including No. 1 Cal, led by Olympic gold medalist Missy Franklin, No. 3 Stanford, No. 11 Arizona and No. 16 UCLA.
The Women of Troy are led by swimming coach Dave Salo and diving coach Hongping Li. The Women of Troy have not won a national championship in swimming since the 1997. Last year, they finished third in the conference competition. USC has won at least two individual titles seven-straight years and 13 out of the last 14 years.
The Pac-12 Network will broadcast delayed coverage of the meet, which will start Friday, Feb. 27 at 10a.m.
Another Coach who talks a good game with really a lack of results. It is sad when the two northern California schools are ranked so high while the Women of Troy are not even top ten being from the land of sunshine. When top swimmer Missy Franklin comes to Berkeley from Indiana and not to USC says all you need to know about the head coach in my estimation.

During the NBA playoffs and March Madness you can definitely find me glued to my TV and getting constant game updates on my phone. During the regular season, however, I cannot be bothered to sit through an entire game unless USC is playing. Football and baseball reign supreme in my heart, and the months between February and April feel empty and unfulfilling.
Thankfully the drought is cut short by the start of college baseball. And right now is a great time to be a Trojan baseball fan. After jumping out to an 8-0 start, the Trojans are looking at their best start since 1988.
USC opened its season against Towson with a dominating sweep of the Tigers. Pitching was the controlling factor in the first two games of the series. Junior right-handed pitcher Brent Wheatley took the mound in the season opener and led the Trojans to a 17-1 win. In six innings pitched, Wheatley only allowed one run on five hits. Following Wheatley’s dominant start, junior left-handed pitcher Kyle Twomey helped USC earn another forceful win over Towson, 10-0. Twomey threw seven innings and only allowed two hits and no runs.
After the homestead against Towson, the Trojans hit the road to take on No. 25 Cal State Fullerton. This time, the Trojans showed off their prowess on the other side of the ball. Junior college transfer David Oppenheim hit his first home run in a USC uniform. Senior catcher Garrett Stubbs followed suit with a two-out, two-strike double to clear the bases to give USC a lead.
The game against Fullerton also demonstrated the solidarity of the team, as the lead changed hands and was never completely secure, and the bullpen rallied around each other to secure the victory. Freshman Mason Perryman got his first collegiate start, pitching four innings and allowing two runs on six hits. Sophomore Bernardo Flores relieved Perryman and threw a career-high four strikeouts in three innings. Junior left-handed pitcher Marc Huberman pitched the eighth inning and struck out the side to set up junior closer Kyle Davis, who earned his second save of the season.
The Trojans again flaunted their dominance in pitching in the win over Kentucky. Junior Santa Barbara City College transfer and left-handed pitcher Tyler Gilbert was on the bump for the first time as a Trojan and did not disappoint. Gilbert threw seven innings and allowed only two runs on seven hits and struck out eight.
On the other side of the ball, junior Timmy Robinson sparked the Trojan offense with two hits, including a two-run home run in the fifth inning. Oppenheim again helped the Trojans out with his bat with a two-out double to drive in a run. Davis closed out the game and earned his third save of the year.
The first game in the series against Oakland proved to be a test for the otherwise spotless Trojans. USC won 8-6, but not before overcoming a 4-0 deficit. Teamwork was again what seemed to give USC the edge in tight situations. Wheatley struggled and wasn’t getting much help on defense, and USC allowed five runs in the fourth inning. Senior Dante Flores entered the game in relief and kept his team in the game. The sophomore lefty threw 3.2 innings, allowing only one hit to a career-high seven strikeouts and no walks.
The Trojans bats came alive as well, with Stubbs leading USC going 4-for-5. He drove in a run and scored two himself. Flores, redshirt junior Bobby Stahel, junior Blake Lacey, Oppenheim and Robinson all contributed to the offensive effort as well.
The second game against Oakland proved to be much easier for the Trojans as they cruised to an 11-1 victory. Twomey got his second win of the year, throwing seven innings, giving up only four hits, one run and a walk. He struck out six in the win. Junior AJ Ramirez led the team offensively with four RBIs. Five different Trojans had multi-hit games. Two freshmen, Brad Wegman and Alex Chavarria flaunted the strength of the bullpen as they closed out the game.
Finally, in the third win against Oakland to secure the sweep, the Trojans made an 8-0 start. Freshman Mitch Hart got his first collegiate start and spent six innings on the mound, allowing only two runs on five hits with four strikeouts. Despite an early 2-0 deficit, Hart and the Trojan offense rallied to come back and win 7-3. Ramirez hit his first home run of the season in the win.
This has been a PSA. If you have not been following the Trojans so far this season, now is the time to start.

Fresh off a weekend trip to New York, USC women’s lacrosse now returns home to the sunny locale of Los Angeles to kick off their conference season this Tuesday.
After battling long travel times, frigid weather and tough opponents, the Women of Troy split their weekend matchups in the Empire State, following up their 7-4 Saturday loss to No. 16 Stony Brook with an 11-7 Sunday victory over Marist College. Sunday’s win marked the first of the season for the team after dropping their opening game in heartbreaking overtime fashion to then-No. 5 Northwestern on Feb. 7 at the Coliseum. The Women of Troy enter conference play with a 1-2 overall record after losing the opening two games.
“We learned from our loss Saturday and looked at Sunday as a new day with a new opportunity,” head coach Lindsey Munday said. “Now we need to learn from that Sunday game as well and continue to improve in preparation for Tuesday’s game.”
USC faces a quick turnaround as they prepare for their third game in four days on Tuesday, as Fresno State comes to town to battle with the Women of Troy at McAlister Field. The Bulldogs enter the game with an 0-1 record after being kenneled by No. 19 Stanford in their season-opening 22-7 conference loss in Palo Alto last Wednesday, Feb. 18. The Tuesday matchup with USC marks the second game of four in a row on the road for the Bulldogs to start their 2015 campaign.
Fresno State will be led by a duo of attackers in sophomore Caroline Dineen-Carlson and freshman Nicole Ortlieb.      Dineen-Carlson put home three goals in the Bulldogs’ game with Stanford, while Ortlieb added two of her own in her first collegiate game. Sophomore midfielder Kyleigh Westgarth will also be a handful for USC as an expert at draw-controls. Westgarth set a Fresno State single-season record last season as a freshman with 37 draw-controls and continued her success in their matchup with Cardinal, tallying five in a strong effort.
“We have to be ready for Fresno (State),” Munday said. “They are a conference opponent, and especially coming off two far away games this weekend, much of our preparation will be mental, in addition to the obvious physical recovery that comes with playing games so close to one another.”
Among others, the Women of Troy will be paced offensively by their own duo of attackers in junior Caroline de Lyra, who leads the team with 11 points on seven goals and four assists, and sophomore Michaela Michael, who has tallied 9 points on six goals and three assists. Michael also leads the team with 12 draw controls, followed closely by junior midfielder Amanda Johansen, who has 11.
Defensively, the Women of Troy will be anchored by junior captain Courtney Tarleton and senior Elizabeth Eddy, who each have caused three turnovers so far this season. Defending the net for USC will be freshman goalkeeper Gussie Johns, who has made 10 saves and surrendered 26 goals in 54 shots faced.
Tuesday’s matchup should be a good one, as the Women of Troy look to even their season record and start off conference play with a bang. Fans who come out to watch should expect a physical game, as the Bulldogs will be playing with chips on their shoulders after losing by    double-digit goals in each of the first two matchups these programs have met.
“Conference games always add an element of intensity, so we need to be mentally and physically locked in,” Munday said. “However, we are excited for the conference season to begin and I think we are going to embrace that intensity fully.”
The game kicks off Tuesday at 3 p.m. at McAlister Field.

No. 2 USC women’s golf is looking to improve their           second-place finish at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge at the UC Irvine Invitational.
The Women of Troy started another different lineup for the tournament: it’s their sixth different lineup in an equal amount of appearances. For the UCI Invitational, the starting lineup for USC consists of juniors Annie Park and Kyung Kim, sophomores Karen Chung and Gabriella Then and freshman Amy Lee. Junior Kim Santiago is playing individually in the tournament.
The first day of play consisted of two rounds. The Women of Troy finished second with a 1-over 577. They’re chasing Washington, who put up a 10-under 566. No. 15 Texas A&M is right behind USC sitting at 2-over.
Atop the leaderboard for USC, Lee finished a stellar 36-hole day with a 6-under 138 (70, 68) to have the individual lead.
She has a two-shot lead over Marijosse Navarro of Texas A&M and Kimmy Hill of Texas Tech. Lee is tied for 12th after an even 36 holes to put her at an even par of 144 (71, 73).
Kim finished the first day with a 4-over 148 (70, 78) to tie for 26th. Chung (76, 75) and Park (77, 74) both finished with a 7-over 151 to tie for 38th. Santiago shot 8-over 152 (74, 78) to tie for 43rd.
The two-day, 54-hole (36, 18) invitational consists of three Pac-12 teams — No. 2 USC,  No. 4 Washington, No. 5 Stanford — and 10 other teams — San Diego State, UC Davis, Pepperdine, Texas A&M, Gonzaga, SMU, UNLV, Texas Tech, CSU Long Beach and host UCI.
The Women of Troy will look to improve their overall scores and overtake Washington for the lead in the final 18 holes of play. Sitting in second place, that’s quite feasible for the Women of Troy. They’ll look especially to Then and Lee, who finished 10th and third, respectively, at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge.
Park, a seasoned veteran, can also help improve the Women of Troy’s place in the UC Irvine Invitational.
Park was the NCAA Champion in 2013 and also holds the record for the most tournament wins at USC with six victories. Her most recent victory was at the Windy City Collegiate Championship this past October where she shot a 5-under and helped the Women of Troy win the tournament with a three-stroke lead to defend their 2013 title.
A strong performance from Park on the final 18 holes of the course will surely help the Women of Troy ascend the leaderboard and claim the top spot from Washington.
Overall this season, the Women of Troy have had two wins during the fall in four events and have three top-2 finishes this season.
The Women of Troy will look to continue the success they have seen so far this season and finish the UC Irvine Invitational with another victory.

I was never the person who dreamed about going abroad. I never fantasized about developing a British accent or hopping on a plane for a weekend trip to Sweden. No, I was content with being a USC student basking in the 80-degree weather and eating lunch at the Campus Center nearly every day.
Therefore, when I was accepted to the London study abroad program for journalism, I was still a bit hesitant and uncertain if I was even going to take the opportunity to live across the pond for a semester. I had only been outside the country twice and had gotten a bad case of homesickness both times.
But an exhausting weekend trip outside of London showed me that living overseas is providing much-needed perspective in my life.
Like most study abroad students realize early on, higher education curriculum differs greatly from country to country. The British school system isn’t as homework-based as the American one. More emphasis is put on reading and final projects than weekly assessments. This difference has afforded my study abroad peers and I more opportunities to explore museums and markets, to complete our readings in historic buildings and libraries around the city and to take weekend trips to other countries.
So my friends and I spent this past weekend in Paris. It is a country so beautiful and rich with literary and artistic history and a reputation for love that when you’re there it’s difficult to imagine being anywhere else. We ate crepes and toured the Eiffel Tower and saw the Mona Lisa. Though it was not as warm as in Los Angeles, we walked along the Seine River, marveled at the padlock bridges and took in the melodic sounds of the French language.
The distance from campus has contributed immensely to my own personal development. In an average day at USC, I don’t have to figure out how to get to a particular location because I’m familiar with Los Angeles. Nor do I need a translation of a menu because I don’t speak the language it was written in. But overseas, I’m constantly learning new bus routes and ways to get around the city. In Paris, I was relying on Google Translate and my French-speaking friends to help me order at a restaurant. Being lost and overcoming language barriers can be challenging. Yet through the realization of my shortcomings in languages and blind spots in independence, I’m learning to overcome those frustrations and grow as an adult. I believe this can only help any student returning to the United States and inching forward into the “real world.”
My trip to Paris was another opportunity to just appreciate the simple moments in life. Taking the time to sit in a pastisserie for an hour or two reminded me of how easy it is to get in a schedule so much so that you forget to appreciate the beauty around you. When I return to campus in the fall, I’ll be sure to take an extra few minutes to appreciate the cardinal and gold flowers that spell out “USC” in front of Doheny and make my way to the top of Runyon Canyon more often.
When it was time to leave Paris and go home — I mean, back to our temporary home in London — I realized how important it was for me to say “yes” to study abroad. Before this experience I had never booked my own plane ticket and hadn’t regularly cooked my own meals. I preferred the convenience of a car compared to the hassle of the train. But the difference between European and American culture has encouraged me to troubleshoot in new ways. Every day I am faced with new opportunities to extend myself and grow as a student.
Therefore, I view study abroad as a series of tests. But the tests you face while studying abroad are not the same as the ones given in Taper Hall during midterm and final season. Instead, living abroad tests your resilience to change, adaptability to new cultures and willingness to immerse yourself in the experience.
Sometimes deciding to take the plunge into a completely new experience can be daunting. It definitely was for me. But if I didn’t choose to study abroad for the semester, I don’t think I would have the same confidence as I now have. So for anyone considering studying abroad, please consider saying “yes.” And more importantly, make an effort to visit Paris. Because like Audrey Hepburn once said, “Paris is always a good idea.”

For a place to relax with good food and an even better ambiance, look no further than the newly opened 3rd Generation Sake Bar in downtown Los Angeles. Conveniently located near the 7th Street Metro Station, this sake bar soft opened on Jan. 26 and has plans for a grand opening later this month.
Restaurateurs Michael Kwan and Kerry Moy of the M2K group opened 3rd Generation to bring the traditional Japanese izakaya experience to the heart of Downtown. Jensen Kumamoto, the restaurant’s operations manager, explained that 3rd Generation provides an experience unlike any other. Kumamoto described the restaurant as an ideal place to go with friends for a casual night out.
One of the most appealing aspects of 3rd Generation is its relaxed ambiance and open layout. The restaurant features panels of light wood and soft lighting. It is easy to imagine spending the evening at the bar with friends, munching on small appetizers and sampling sake and soju. While the lunch crowd is mainly local business people, the evening crowd is a diverse mix of locals, students and tourists.
Their limited menu is complimented by a full selection of sake and soju, rice-based alcoholic drinks. The different flavors come from different milling processes and added flavorings. Though sake bars are popular in Japan, it can be a new experience for many L.A. residents. The knowledgeable bar staff makes recommendations based on current preferences for wine, beer, scotch or cocktails. 3rd Generation also mixes sake and soju cocktails and offers beer by the bottle. Though the prices run a bit higher than a typical bar, the imported beverages are a palate-cleansing treat.
“Downtown was missing a sake bar that serves rustic-style Japanese food and hand rolls,” said Kumamoto.
Kumamoto said that the freshly-made hand rolls differ from sushi and recommends the five hand roll lunch combo, which comes with spicy tuna, salmon, toro, baked crab and spicy albacore. The hand rolls are delicate and contain less rice than most sushi rolls. They are small enough to be eaten in a few bites, are served whole — as opposed to sliced — and still come with the traditional pickled ginger and wasabi.
The menu is purposely kept small, “to focus on quality,” said Kumamoto. Each entree is presented with artistic grace and has a delicate balance of flavors and colors. Despite the limited menu and somewhat smaller-than-expected portion size, the dishes are enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing. They also serve sashimi and nigiri sushi rolls. Unlike other sashimi dishes, 3rd Generation meticulously slices their food to add flavor and color to each bite. In the future, 3rd Generation plans to include more vegetarian entrees, possibly including a vegan ramen. They currently use chicken or pork broth in their noodles.
The restaurant’s aim is to stay true to Japanese bar fare and provide a light and satisfying dining experience. The ramen is worlds away from the instant noodle bowls typical to college dorms and comes with a variety of toppings, such as bamboo shoots and soy-marinated egg. The dessert menu features house-made black sesame ice cream and traditional matcha mochi — a green tea and sticky rice treat. 3rd Generation’s current menu clearly caters to seafood lovers, but they are willing to make accommodations to meet the needs of their diners.
“Downtown is still up-and-coming, it has progressively gotten busier in the last seven years and is continuing to grow,” Kumamoto said. “A few years ago it was just sandwich shops that closed after lunch.”
3rd Generation plans to continue integrating into the Downtown community and creating more social media connections.
“Social media is huge in the restaurant world,” said Kumamoto. “It’s how people find out about us nowadays.”
In the near future, 3rd Generation will also offer take-out and delivery within a three-mile radius. Luckily for students, campus and the surrounding student housing fall within that range. They plan on collaborating with food ordering services, such as Eat24 and GrubHub. But take-out customers will miss out on the relaxing, homey atmosphere of 3rd Generation. While the prices can be a bit out of reach for a student budget, the service and experience are well worth the price.
“Think of it as your local, every day pub,” Kumamoto said. “Hang out here, have a glass of sake and some nigiri.”

Red Bull is more than just a beverage. For countless athletes, it provides sponsorship and endorsements. The USC Ski and Snowboard team is no stranger to being taken under Red Bull’s wing. In their latest project, the team is competing in Red Bull’s Bracket Reel Competition.
The competition pits eight of the best collegiate candidates against one another for the title of “supreme video.” Each team is required to upload a new video for each of the three rounds. The first video is based on the morning, the second on the afternoon and the third on the night to represent one perfect day of the season. Each video is about three to four minutes in length and depicts the activities of that time of day. So far, the videos have shown each teams’ members performing incredible feats of skill as well as the (more than) occasional wipe out. At the end of the competition, voters will choose winners in the categories of Best Conditions, Best Locations and Most Team Spirit. The winning team receives a triumphant closing weekend at the resort of their choice.
USC’s team is composed of about 120 members with varying skill levels and experience. The team competes in the Southern California Collegiate Snowsports Conference in skiing and snowboarding giant slalom, skiercross, boardercross, slopestyle and halfpipe. The team is the two-time National Champion for overall freestyle skiing in 2009 and 2010.
They enter the competition with a staggering 3.8 million views and a loyal following of 8,000 subscribers on their YouTube channel. They have even attained a sponsorship deal from GoPro.
The other seven teams come from all over the country: University of Utah, Oregon State University, University of Colorado at Boulder, Pennsylvania State University, Loyola Marymount University, University of Massachusetts, Amherst and University of Washington. However, only the University of Washington, Loyola Marymount University and University of Massachusetts, Amherst remain in the competition. Despite the widespread talent, USC Ski and Snowboard President Tyler Karow is confident in USC’s chances.
“Our editor Victoria Stein has been killing it, putting together some top notch videos week after week. After we managed to beat CU Boulder in round one, we knew we had to up our game to compete in the semifinals. We shot our last video at Bear Mountain this past Monday and within a few days, she threw together the perfect video that we need to win,” Karow said.
Aside from USC’s team being hand-selected to compete, the competition itself was created by one of USC’s very own. Robson Morgan, a PhD student studying economics currently in his fifth year at USC, pitched the competition to Red Bull.
“Actually, I think I came up with the idea when I was arguing with my friend Christian Sander about whose school had the best skiers, LMU or USC,” said Morgan.
For the actual pitching of the idea, it helped that Sander was a producer with experience contacts at Red Bull and in pitching projects. The two then pitched the idea to the company, and one year later, they saw their idea become a reality.
The competition goes beyond proving each team can work a camera.
“This competition is truly unique … Bracket Reel is the first time we have ever been able to enter a video competition. Putting out quality video content is huge in the ski and snowboard world, so it’s epic that we have the opportunity to broadcast our team’s image in this way,” Karow said.
Karow also noted that USC stands out because “more than any other team, USC has a wide range of talent. While many of the schools in this competition focus on a select few riders, [USC has] dozens of quality riders with enough skill to be featured.”
The semifinals run through Feb. 28 with the championship round beginning on March 2. Voting takes place on redbullbracketreel.com and continues through the final round. As the official competition site says, “It’s all downhill from here.”

In 2011, the United States Supreme Court investigated the health and safety standards of the California prison system and determined that overcrowding made inmates’ stays comparable to cruel and unusual punishment. They then ordered a reduction of California prisoners by 110,000, and even that still leaves the California prison population to 137 percent capacity.
Proposition 47 was created to keep non-violent offenders out of prison for extended periods of time to decrease overcrowding. The proposition has allowed jailers to release offenders that pose no real threat to society and reduce otherwise lengthy sentences, a monumental step in social justice.
If an inmate is jailed for a felony that Proposition 47 would now call a misdemeanor, that inmate is eligible for resentencing. They may petition to have a new hearing to determine whether their release is appropriate. This process lessens the financial burden on California prisons.
There are thousands of inmates still eligible for new sentences; since 1990, California has jailed more than 423,000 inmates as felons whose sentences could be misdemeanors.
With more financial burdens lifted, the prison system is free to use money that would have been used to jail non-violent offenders to fund drug rehabilitation, mental health treatment and truancy. These programs are set to begin in 2016.
Rehabilitation is a necessary step, seeing as in 2012, one-year recidivism rates for California inmates was 47 percent. California recently put $2 billion into the prison system that was meant for rehabilitation programs, but most of it went to sustaining county jails that could not survive on their budgets due to overcrowding.
Lessening inmate numbers, however, isn’t just merely an economic issue. Proposition 47 has allowed officers to keep criminals behind bars. In the past, prison officials were often forced to release inmates sooner than they otherwise would due to overcrowding. The decreased number of prisoners has allowed jailers to stick to the time assigned each prisoner and keep inmates in prison for as long as needed to protect the public.
The most important task the proposition is attempting to accomplish, however, is one much more difficult to measure. The proposition changes all sorts of former felonies to misdemeanors, including small-scale thievery, forgery and fraud. But arguably the most relevant offense that has been reduced to a misdemeanor is personal use of illegal drugs.
California decriminalized marijuana use in early 2011, and according to most reports, this decriminalization has led to nothing but positive results. A study by the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice states this decriminalization “has not resulted in harmful consequences for teenagers, such as increased crime, drug overdose, driving under the influence, or school dropout.” In fact, the study indicates that decriminalization makes risk factors lower for teenagers.
Proposition 47 does not decriminalize all illegal drugs. Moving personal drug use from a felony to a misdemeanor, however, could have a similar effect. Many drug addicts simply do not come forward for fear of a felony charge, and therefore do not get the counseling or treatment they need.
Fixing California prisons is long overdue; it is not simply an economic crisis for the state, but a human rights issue. California can no longer afford to allow overcrowding, and citizens of California desperately need the treatment that funding from Proposition 47 will provide.

“Proposition 47 was created to keep non-violent offenders out of prison for extended periods of time to decrease overcrowding.”
You were almost right, if you would have left off “to decrease overcrowding.”  People in the state of California were disgusted with the idea of such severe sentences foisted on petty drug offenders; their motivation was not the issue of relieving overcrowding.  Secondarily, they were disgusted with the idea of the taxes being spent to support these offenders in prison for unnecessarily long amounts of time.  Your statement implies that if we could afford to build a hundred more prisons, we would be happy to lock up everybody and their brother.

When Proposition 47 was approved late last year in a 60-40 margin, human rights advocates rejoiced. The ballot introduced less severe sentencing for nonviolent crimes, unless the perpetrator has a prior record of “murder, rape, certain sex offenses or certain gun crimes.” Many felonies, such as stealing and personal use of drugs, would be demoted to mere misdemeanors with a less hefty fine. Though Proposition 47 sought to create enormous strides for criminal justice, it nonetheless overlooked many crucial elements in the implementation of social improvement.
The Los Angeles Times followed up the ballot approval by illustrating its harrowing effects in a Feb. 21 investigation. The article opened with Los Angeles Police Department officer Jose Ibarra sifting through a rundown shack. After lifting a sooty mattress, Ibarra found needles and a glass pipe, denoting drug use from the shelter’s owner, a homeless man. And with that, because of recent government modifications, the homeless man was let off without so much as a slap to the wrist. It was obvious that the man, without proper punishment, would continue his drug usage. According to LAPD Sgt. Chris Gomez who was also at the scene, the arrest would have been “a waste of [his] time.”
Keeping drug users and people with minor criminal charges away from prisons can indeed ameliorate many problems in the justice system. The most obvious dilemma is the overcrowding in the American incarceration system. According to the Population Reference Bureau, since 2002, the United States has topped the list for most incarcerations in the world. Many imprisonments are rooted in social inequality; inmates tend to be uneducated and of low socioeconomic status. But eradicating arrests based on such prejudices is only one side of the story. There needs to be the promotion of rehabilitation, which Proposition 47 lacks and which therefore contributes to its short-sightedness.
In doing almost nothing to rectify former criminals’ life-ruining conduct, the state government redefines crime. The Los Angeles Times reported a 30 percent reduction in narcotic arrests in the urban area and a 48 percent reduction in the entire area under LAPD patrol. These numbers, however, are superficial. They do not reflect increased safety, but rather denote the government’s condonement of illegal behavior.
As Sen. Diane Feinstein puts it, “The problem is the definition of ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ is extremely narrow.” For example, stealing firearms is now placed on the low rungs in the hierarchy of crime, with the “get out of jail” card at only $950. But consider the ramifications. The stolen weapon, especially without the proper qualifications for administration, can bring danger to many surrounding civilians, breaking the peaceful well-being of the community. Proposition 47 has catalyzed bigger, more destructive acts of criminality.
So here’s a proposition for the proposition: Instead of turning a blind eye to crimes in order to not burden the criminal justice system, recognize the issues obstructing safety. Work with repeat offenders instead of letting them go, and implement a system in which people who come from disadvantaged backgrounds are not unfairly targeted. Proposition 47 does very little to rid California of crime. Instead, it slaps a Band-Aid on the situation, and calls it a day.

Before arriving in Italy, I didn’t quite know what to expect, aside from the beaming opinions of previous travelers. Whenever I’d tell people I was about to study abroad in Florence, they would always gush things like, “Oh, you’re going to love it!” or “Florence was my favorite city when I visited Europe. The people are amazing, the food is unbelievable, and the art is incredible,” and my personal favorite “You’re going to Italy? Oh god, you’ll never be able to eat boxed pasta again, trust me.”
I’ve been here almost two months now, and they were most definitely right. Florence is as magical and romantic and amazing as promised, but the one thing everyone neglected to tell me was the danger this seemingly innocent little city holds in store for its naïve American study abroad students. Florence is a lot like New York City in the sense that there are a whole lot of people in very close quarters. Everyone keeps a straight face, and will not hesitate to push you out of their way. This means two things: germs and crowded sidewalks (and by sidewalks, I mean curbs because as the city evolved, its narrow streets and walkways did not).
It wasn’t until I was walking to class one day and had my elbow clipped by a feisty purple Fiat blazing through the streets that I realized I was definitely not in L.A. anymore. It didn’t hurt as much as it shocked me, but when I overheard a conversation in class about a girl who got hit by a car, rolled up on the hood and ran away before the driver had time to get out and check if she was okay, I realized I got lucky. Interestingly enough, neither crosswalks nor speed limits are a thing here. When you have this many people sausaged together in nearly claustrophobic parameters, accidents — and illness, are bound to occur.
Though I’ve been decently sick for nearly half the time I’ve lived here, and practically shoved into the street too many times to keep count, in a weird way, I feel like it’s built character — the kind you can take with you wherever you go and still manage to flourish.
I’ve found that the only way to successfully navigate the streets of Florence by yourself without getting run over by a taxi or Vespa is to walk tall, move quickly and stand your ground. As I left the doctor’s office yesterday, prescriptions and antibiotics in hand, I kept this in mind, staring down anyone who walked by and looked like they expected me to move.
My defensive tactic proved to be very effective; each and every individual I passed quietly migrated around me and into the street. For the first time in a long time, I had made in back to my apartment in one piece — not a scratch, scrape or bruised ego in sight. Finally, I’m starting to feel like a real ‘Florentina.’
Italian Phrase of the Week: “Tieni duro!” meaning, “Stand your ground!”
Ciao, belli!

This year, Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen plans on re-introducing legislation to reduce carbon emissions and address climate change. One would think that Hollen has reasons to be optimistic.
On Monday, The New York Times reported that one of the main researchers who Republicans have referenced in their denial of human-caused climate change, Wei-Hong Soon, has been called into question due to close ties to the corporate interests that would benefit from such a misconception. Soon has accepted over $1.2 million from interest groups and published at least 11 papers that failed to disclose his bias. In his papers, Soon claims that variations in the Sun’s energy can explain the majority of recent global warming — a conclusion contested by the majority of scientists both outside and inside his own organization. These revelations, in addition to the fact that 2014 was the hottest year on record, might finally be the compelling evidence that conservatives need to change their outdated view on climate change, and work to enact policies that will protect the planet from being further damaged.
Unfortunately, it seems such optimism is misplaced.
Despite a consensus in the scientific community that climate change is caused by humans and an ever-dwindling supply of credible dissenters (see Wei-Hong Soon), Republicans stubbornly deny both the existence of and the need to combat climate change. As a matter of fact, the Vice Chairman of the Science, Space and Technology Committee in the House, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) asserted in 2013 that “global warming is a total fraud” and is “designed” by liberals to further their own agenda. And Rohrabacher is not a rarity.
His colleague, Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK), the chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, claimed just last month that climate change is real, but the idea that that man is responsible is “a hoax.”
Let me reiterate the absurdity of these comments. The Vice Chairman of the Science, Space and Technology Committee and the Chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works are in total agreement that the broader scientific community is mistaken about climate change, and that all of the hubbub about global warming is a hoax.
With science like that, it’s no surprise that climate change legislation would result in hot heads and cold shoulders.

They know exactly what they are doing but continue to act like unwitting fools and tools.  The constituents who re-elect these charlatans are some of the biggest suckers in the world because they are voting against their own best interest.

It’s Saturday night and you’ve decided you want to stay in. Finally a night to catch up on the mounds of homework you have for the week, or the job applications that you promised yourself you were going to submit today. Or maybe even stay in bed and binge watch on Netflix. Either way, you’re not spending 40 bucks on going out to eat in Downtown L.A. and that makes you happy.
But you don’t want to cook. We’re not even halfway through the semester yet and you’ve already given up on the fancy healthy stuff you were making that first week in January. You’ve traded the honey-ginger grilled salmon and steak dinners for microwavable mac and cheese and wraps to go from the closest Fresh and Easy. Plus, all those plates piled up on the sink? Yeah, those aren’t going to clean themselves…
Thankfully, this grilled cheese with spicy havarti is here to save your Saturday night. Here’s a simple, 15-miunte college-proof recipe that will not make a mess in your kitchen and will pretty much change the way you perceive grilled cheese.
You will need:
Start by making the pesto sauce. You will need:

All you need to do now is put the almonds, cilantro and lemon in a fruit processor and pulse them. As you do this, add the olive oil until the pesto feels smooth.

Now use a sauté pan to heat up your bread slices. Butter one side of the slices of bread and put them into the sauté pan. Divide the slices of cheese evenly among your bread. Give it a couple of minutes until you see that the bread is browner and the cheese melted.
Miranda Mazariegos | Daily Trojan
When it’s done, place the slices of bread on a cutting board and add the pesto sauce on one slice of bread. Place the roasted tomatoes on the other slice, put the sandwich together and enjoy!

Also feeling like taking a drink? Try adding raspberries and mint leaves to your wine tonight to give it a stronger taste.

Loïc Rémy has bounced around for the entirety of his career. The French striker played for four clubs in France, including Lyon and Marseille, prior to moving to England in 2013 and joining Queens Park Rangers. Rémy flashed his brilliance for QPR, but he was loaned out to Newcastle United the following season. Just after the commencement of the 2014-15 campaign, Rémy finalized a four-year deal with English heavyweight Chelsea F.C.
After spending years as a European football nomad, Rémy appears to have finally found his home. He is thriving in José Mourinho’s system and has already established himself as a catalyst for this attack.
Capable of scoring in a variety of ways, Rémy is proving that he will be an asset for the Blues moving forward. The 28-year-old is showing the faithful at Stamford Bridge that he is absolutely lethal in front of goal and that he also brings a well-rounded skill set to the table. Rémy is a proven goal scorer. When he does not start games, he is an adequate “super sub” for star forward Diego Costa, who is also enjoying a fantastic first season in London.
The biggest question moving forward will be whether or not Rémy can break into the squad as a consistent member of the starting XI.
Mourinho’s midfield is absolutely stacked, with Cesc Fàbregas, Oscar, Willian, Eden Hazard, Nemanja Matić, Ramires and new Fiorentina signing Juan Cuadrado all contributing on a regular basis. With this stable of midfielders at his disposal, Mourinho tends to line up with five in the midfield and play with only one true striker up top. Costa is the preferred forward at this point, but Rémy’s steady improvement has undoubtedly impressed his manager.
Rémy is incredibly valuable because the team essentially does not lose anything when he replaces Diego Costa. Costa has been working through lingering hamstring issues this season, so Rémy’s services have been quite necessary. At 6’1”, 176 pounds, he is essentially the same size as Costa. Fellow striker Didier Drogba is also a physical specimen, so both Drogba and Rémy serve as viable replacements for Costa from a physicality standpoint. Like Drogba, Rémy is also capable of turning on the afterburners and leaving defenders in the dust, making him a nightmare to mark.
The Frenchman made his Chelsea debut on September 13, 2014, in a match against Swansea. He replaced Diego Costa in the 72nd minute, but it took him just nine minutes of game action to log his first goal in a Chelsea jersey, as he slotted a low shot into the bottom corner to extend Chelsea’s lead to 4-1. The team went on to win 4-2, but the real victory of the day for the Blues was the realization that they had acquired a top-notch striker.
Rémy started the UEFA Champions League match against Maribor on October 21, but he pulled up with an injury after scoring in the 13th minute. Though he was forced to exit the match early, he still managed to find the back of the net in his short time on the pitch.
Rémy has a knack for scoring goals regardless of how much time he spends on the field. When facing Tottenham on December 3 in a Premier League fixture, Mourinho turned to Rémy to sub into the game. Rémy trotted onto the pitch in the 67th minute and managed to find the back of the net just six minutes later to seal a 3-0 Chelsea victory.
Another win for the leaders of the Premier League. Another clutch goal from No. 18.
The speedy forward is not only a goal scorer, but he is also a dynamic playmaker in the final third, as he is capable of swinging in threatening crosses. Rémy is constantly asking questions of opposing defenses, sometimes purely based on his excellent movement off the ball.
He scored a massive goal to draw first blood against Manchester City on Jan. 31, as he crashed the net and tapped in a beautifully-played ball from Eden Hazard. His fluidity is clearly blending with Chelsea’s combination play in the final third, which is a terrifying premise for opposing defenses.
Rémy occasionally drops into deep positions to receive the ball, giving him the option to hold the ball up and combine with trailing midfielders. He will, however, sometimes elect to take it and go himself, as he can easily shake the first would-be tackler by turning on a dime and exploding into the space ahead of him. This is a guy who can absolutely fly when he has nothing but green grass in front of him.
In and around the 18-yard box, Rémy finds open spaces and anticipates passes from teammates exceptionally well. He is physical when chasing down through balls and has no problem bodying defenders. Likewise, he is a savvy finisher and is cold-blooded in front of goal.
Chelsea’s 4-2-3-1 formation does not lend itself to a Costa-Rémy duo up top, but the Frenchman should only see his role in the team increase as he continues to play at such a high level.
Rémy has been featured in the starting lineup in just seven games in all competitions for José Mourinho’s side thus far, but he has found the back of the net five times and has looked menacing every step of the way. The French striker may be labeled as a goal scorer, but he is so much more to this team.
Rémy should only see his minutes increase as the season wears on, as he looks the part and certainly has the potential to become an integral part of the Blues’ offense for years to come.

Quyen Nguyen Le | Daily Trojan
I was incredibly nervous when I started last semester in Santiago because I was required to live with a host family and I had not lived with any form of parents whatsoever in over four years. I like to think of myself as an easygoing person who can live with most people in most situations, but I was afraid that I’d be the difficult one to live with. I was afraid that they’d be expecting a sweet, wholesome all-American girl only to be given an introverted Asian kid with a semi-vegan diet.
We were told early on that it was normal for Chileans to live with their parents until they’re like 26 or married. This living-with-parents situation was apparently why we were seeing a lot of young people getting really handsy in the public parks of Santiago. So I understood that frequently interacting with other people’s parents would be a part of my cultural learning, but living with parents — this part I was still anxious about.
We all received letters from our host families introducing themselves the day before we actually met them. Mine sent me a family photo with three people in it and used the confusingly worded phrase matrimonio abierto (literally meaning “open marriage”) to describe themselves, which made me think that I was about to move in with a polyamorous family. I think I was relieved because I thought maybe there would be less attention on me if there were more people in the family.
Well, it turned out that my host parents weren’t in an open marriage. But like people in open marriages, they were really big on constant communication, which, in addition to already not being that fluent in Spanish, I’m really bad at.
I was raised on silence, and it’s a language I can speak better than any other. My own parents and I, maybe because of the language barrier between us, understood each other not with spoken words — since often we did not understand the same words in the same way — but with habits and rituals. We didn’t always completely understand each other though, but this kind of silence too became a normal part of our co-existence.
But I think my silence worried my host parents, who, at one point, might have suspected that I was stealing their spoons.
So, while I avoided answering a surprisingly frank question at the dinner table about the status of my virginity during the second week I lived with them, I did make an effort to more intentionally cultivate certain communication habits that I had never before, like training myself to remember to tell them where I was going and when I expected to be back or asking for help even though my fiercely independent self prefers to figure things out on my own.
I’m not sure if I entirely succeeded, to be honest. I might have still appeared closed off and private in the end. But trying to better communicate with my host family has really pushed me to rethink the various ways in which I can more sustainably relate to my own parents.
