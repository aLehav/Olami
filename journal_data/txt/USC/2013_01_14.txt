After the Halloween shooting that shook the community, student security has become a priority at USC.
Because of rash decisions made following the Halloween shooting on campus, it has become increasingly difficult for students to gain access to their dorm rooms. First, freshmen must swipe their student ID cards to get into the building. Second, students must go through a fingerprint scan at the front desk where they will  receive the OK to swipe their ID cards once again to access the elevators.
Some new measures that the Dept. of Public Safety have implemented are effective, but it is important that school officials shift their security focus from residence halls to entrances around campus.
Though the new access policy in residence halls might slightly reduce theft in dorms, it has made it difficult for students to reach their dorms as well as interact with each other. If one forgets an item, it can take upwards of 10 minutes just to get to his or her dorm room. If students are advised to keep their doors locked at all times, there should theoretically be no thefts and consequently, a lack of necessity for heightened security.  There are many effective ways to prevent crime and heighten safety in the residence halls without increased security, which is tedious for students and costly for administration.
It appeared ironic that it became more difficult for students to access their dorms following the injurious Halloween incident, during which a shooter, who was not affiliated with USC, fired near the center of campus.  In all, however, it is important that DPS makes more of an effort to secure the campus’ entrances to proactively prevent danger from occurring on campus.
In the past, it was not uncommon to see a gate attendant taking a nap while on duty at night or looking on with disregard at those entering campus. Recently, however, DPS has become more active and has implemented new policies, such as having ID checkpoints from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. at eight heavily trafficked gates and closing off other entrances. Students and faculty can only hope that DPS will continue to play a larger role at the entryways as of Jan. 14, when the new measures went into effect.
With improvements made to perimeter security, it would be logical to lessen dorm room security.  Though it is clear that DPS and Student Affairs prioritize student safety, it is also important that they see student satisfaction as a goal. It is often difficult for students to feel at “home,” however, when one is forced through a security checkpoint nearly akin to the Transportation Security Administration’s at LAX.  Focusing our security measures on prevention of crime at the gate as opposed to prevention of crime beyond the gate, the feeling of security will heighten among students and faculty.
As with any other environment needing security, it is imperative that the university recognizes its security in depth. In other words, security efforts should begin off-campus with the Los Angeles Police Department, then at the campus perimeter, followed by on-campus patrols exercised by DPS and, lastly, the residence halls.  It’s a logical conclusion that crime is managed at entry points, the inner levels of security, such as DPS and its protection of the residence halls, will require less concern and attention.  USC is a home for thousands of students and faculty members, and it is important that realistic convenience is not compromised by endless security checkpoints.

You lost me after “Shook the community”. 
read the crime reports for L.A. one non fatal shooting is hardly shaking a community.
Stop complaining and grow up.
We really are the university of spoiled children if we  reject something given to us that others would fight their hardest to have. We have been given a thoughtful gift of safety, and so many are rejecting it. We’re very lucky to have safety as a luxury. And… We’re very lucky to have a voice. And how spoiled are we to say we feel like we’re symbolically being shut and feel like we can’t spread our wings because of some 2 foot fences, when people are physically and literally being shot and wounded and killed. I would easily trade claustrophobia for another’s life.  I’m so glad that the new security measures around campus are stimulating discussion, but it seems that those speaking out are trending on the negative side. Well here’s a positive that will end with a Star Trek quote:
I am grateful for USC’s action towards improving safety. Better safe than sorry. How much are you currently doing interacting with the community between the hours of 9pm and 6 am that you feel like your rights and freedoms to engage locals in immersive discussion is being taken away? People are generalizing, idealizing, and exaggerating what they perceive to be happening. You are not living in Fort Knox (which happens to be in the suburbs of Kentucky) and you’re not living in a “castle”, as much as you would like to, it there is no moat and drawbridge with 60 foot walls and last time I checked we have indoor plumbing so dramatic metaphors aren’t pragmatic to your argument. Also you are not in prison, you have an ID, you can go where you want when you want, you’re not at University of Alcatraz. Also, last time I checked the school did this to protect your health and life. And I don’t know about everyone else, but about 200 grand for my education is a lot of money, and I pay USC for my scholastic education and the availability of programs like JEP that actually integrate us with the community. I don’t really pay for a community park/ recreation center. Even parks close after dark. Although it is cool to see the guys on their bikes and skateboards doing what they do, I enjoy that during the day between the hours of 6 am and 9 pm. And I think one of the greatest things USC does is host elementary LA unified school district tours of campus, so that underserved youth have something to aspire to. But lemme tell you what, those tours bettering their future aren’t happening at 9pm. And I can’t tell you the last time I saw a student engaging and conversing with a random “University of South Central” area local, let alone at 2am. Oh wait, never. I’m pretty sure organizations like Troy Camp who work to cultivate the culture of the community at large don’t have office hours then. But I can count the times I’ve been walking home from a group project (the intended purpose of a collegiate campus) at 12 am and felt unsafe because of cat calls and threats around me. “You better watch yourself honey” and “Promise not to scream” to name a few. Seriously, there’s a reason our taxpayer funded parks and open spaces largely close at sunset. Numerous studies can prove that the intentions of the vast majority of those out after dark (and on a campus they don’t attend) aren’t out with the motives of picking daisies.
If it is an inconvenience for those few passers through to go the extra 100 yards to walk on the perimeter of campus instead then welcome to SC football.
And factually, do you know that if you’re so proud, that your proud university has declining numbers of applications with the onset of each new tragic “accident”. So Nikias and the rest of the school are working to preserve the integrity of our educational establishment.
I don’t see you all complaining each time a new library or multi million dollar school is donated. So guess what, this is for you too. It’s all for you. Every decision USC makes is not to turn you into brainwashed minions. They are doing this to expand what USC can do for its students and its community. And reality check: you’re pretty lucky to go to a private institution with an open campus and open buildings. We are of the handful of private universities that have had open doors. And you know what, the other ones have a lot better community crime rates. We’re in South Central (google maps calls it that so it’s not some generalizing outsider slur), and it’s a miracle USC hasn’t taken stricter measures in security. NYU is “the school of the city” and they check ID’s in every building at 2 pm! And they’re in a lot more privileged neighborhood than we have surrounding our campus. So gratitude for what openness we do have is a great place to be. So once you put it in perspective, maybe thank the DPS officer patrolling by your residence, or better yet, thank the unarmed officer that chased after the halloween shooting suspect and alleged gang member in an extended pursuit.
We are lucky to have so many people dedicated to our safety and wellbeing rather than their own.
I am very sure that those parents who have lost their children to violent crime in our community, whether by injury or death, on or off campus, wish any as such measure as this campus checkpoint was being taken. Safety is widely a priority for parents and for good reason, because they love us and want us to live long, educated, healthy, happy lives. They want us to live long and prosper.
What ever happened to safety first?
Keep it pithy, and people will pay attention.
[…] A fingerprint scanning system implemented at on-campus resident halls has made them more secure (although it is annoying to some), significantly reducing property theft from the typical 25 – 30 incidents in a three-week […]

Daniel Razzano | Daily Trojan
When 26-year-old computer programmer and political activist Aaron Swartz committed suicide last Friday, news of his death spread across the Internet with the same speed as the viral videos and the applications he had helped to produce.
At the time of his death, he faced unnecessarily harsh felony charges entailing a possible 35-year sentence and a $1 million fine. His crime? The theft of some scholarly articles from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology JSTOR digital library with the intent to distribute the papers to the public. MIT announced yesterday that they were investigating its role in his death.
The issue of online piracy has incited passionate debate since the creation of the World Wide Web. Aside from the ethical issues of using another person’s property without their permission, U.S. Congressmen have recently argued that online piracy is severely detrimental to the American economy and is destructive to individual businesses.
Both of these claims are misleading.
Recent articles have indicated that online piracy has little to no effect on businesses, and that the restriction of free, public information sharing could actually work against the favor of the economy. Moreover, these restrictions stifle creativity, encourage censorship and are a disservice to the budding social entrepreneurs of the 21st century.
The emphasis of the U.S. government on prosecuting and restricting “information-sharers” such as Swartz is unnecessary and ultimately counterproductive. In the past year, Congressional bills such as the Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect Intellectual Property Act, known as SOPA and PIPA, have invoked uproar in the online community because of their intent to restrict and limit the flow of information flow on the Internet, essentially censoring online interactions.
Though neither bill passed, Congress continues to contend that online piracy costs the U.S. economy between $200 and $250 billion per year, resulting in a loss of around 750,000 jobs.
If those figures sound too high to be true, it’s because they are. Julian Sanchez, a research fellow from the Cato Institute, investigated those claims last year and found they “[could not] be substantiated or traced back to an underlying data source or methodology,” suggesting that the U.S. government might have just made them up. In fact, Sanchez argued that it was virtually impossible to measure the effects of online piracy on the economy, because of the variable nature of its economic effects. Any attempt to do so, Sanchez argues, is misleading and most likely exaggerated.
Instead, research suggests that music and entertainment businesses, which are most likely to be affected by online piracy, have done better in recent economic crises than similar businesses in other industries.
Despite this evidence, threats of legal action against illegal downloads continue to escalate. Most common are the pre-movie advertisements that ominously send the message that piracy is a social evil. “Would you steal a purse? Would you steal a car?” the advertisements ask viewers, implying that clicking a button to download a song or a movie is the legal equivalent of petty theft. It’s, of course, not as simple as that.
Unlike the theft of a car, the illegal downloading of a song does not necessarily imply tangible loss or harm to another. Equally compelling is the increasingly obvious truth that online piracy restrictions are difficult to enforce. Illegal downloading has become a norm for the Millennial Generation. We would all be hard-pressed to find someone who hasn’t downloaded something off the Internet without permission.
The openness and anonymity of the Internet has afforded the Millennial Generation enormous advantages, enabling individuals access to music, entertainment, information and community where they otherwise might be deprived.
The resources of the U.S. government could perhaps be better spent by enacting policies that will actually benefit the economy and potential business leaders. Losses caused by piracy are far outweighed by the benefits of a free, unrestricted flow of information. In the case of Swartz, the real loss is the incalculable tragedy of an inspirational and influential talent gone too soon.
As Swartz said, “It’s called stealing or piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a ship and murdering its crew. But sharing isn’t immoral — it’s a moral imperative. Only those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy.”
Tragically, it may indeed have been greed that led the U.S. government to its decisions.
 
Payal Mukerji is a junior majoring in business administration. Her column “Risky Business” runs Tuesdays.
It seems to me that the author is not suggesting that piracy is synonymous with productivity but rather that the harsh regulations for online piracy are ineffective, immoral, and impossible to implement. In this respect, she is correct. I find it ludicrous that this man faced a possible 35 year sentence for distributing knowledge while corrupt investment bankers and CEOs run amok. The truth of the matter is that US government is too afraid to prosecute big companies and overeager to attack visionaries like Swartz. Ms. Mukerji highlights this truth quite well.
According to the indictment, Swartz broke into a wiring closet and attempted to download a large part of huge commercial database. The owners of that database spent a lot of time and money building a system that’s pretty universally available for no money to students and faculty members – and their institutions pay for the system.  Taking it upon himself to break in and download might be called “hacktivism” by those who support it – but  at the end of the day it’s taking away all the effort and yes, money, that went into building a system that benefits everyone..  If he had spoken out, negotiated, collected a lot of people who thought the terms unfair and proposed a change – that’s protected activity and maybe even the right perspective.  But this is vigilante-ism, not civil disobedience, and indefensible.  Still – I would hope that the “possible 35 year sentence” is far beyond what any judge would actually impose – seems harsh to me, too.
Curious that the author disregards research from the US government that quantifies the significant impact of piracy, but swallows whole the unsubstantiated talking points from the Cato Institute, funded by Google to oppose the rights of the artists and other content creators.
Payal seems to believe that Millennials are incapable of telling right from wrong, and piracy from productivity.  Perhaps she can’t, but she is clearly an outlier.  Hers is a cynical point of view that completely misunderstands ethics, business, and the moral standards of her peers.
I am surprised that the author is seeking a career in business administration.  If he runs a supermarket will he see it as a moral imperitive to give away food, or if he builds houses, is it a moral imperitive to give away shelter?  All these things are needed – but commerce is the only way that has proven to work to match demand with supply, to incent people to work and work hard, and to attract capital.  IP is no different.  Sure it sounds great to “share” but what of the artist who spent years perfecting craft and much effort in creating a work.  Doesn’t the artist have the right to say – hey, I’m entitled to decide what happens to my work!   Over the past 300 years, the system that’s worked is to allow artists this right – and that encourages them to make the works in the first place.  The meme that is often told that copying hurts no one is simply false – making a copy hurts the artist upon whom decency, and the law, confer the exclusive right to make copies.  That’s not “greed” any more than your right to decide whether to work and for what price is “greed” rather than donating all your services and hoping that someone will take care of you.

If I had a nickel for all the times someone has quizzically asked me whether print journalism is dead, I’d have … well, at least enough coin to treat myself to a nice dinner out.
In fact, sometimes it feels that more people than not see the print medium spiraling into oblivion, to be filed away in history’s annals alongside the likes of the LaserDisc and the humble cassette Walkman. That’s not all: Traditional professional journalism continues to garner heat, with accusations of bias and unethical reporting unraveling the newsrooms of some of the world’s biggest media outlets. In its stead, citizen coverage of current events, personalized stories via blogs and social media, and other forms of New Journalism have risen.
The decline of the print medium is understandable: For the vast majority of readers, online journalism is the preferred method of consuming news, and the platform allows journalists to craft stories in cutting-edge ways. The journalism industry needs to get the hint: After all, those who fail to adapt merely go extinct.
As editor, my job is to make sure the Daily Trojan continues its traditions of strong original reporting and writing — elements we’ve dedicated countless hours to, both in the newsroom and out in the field. Honest reporting and writing is our bread and butter, and we will continue to train young journalists and give them a platform to shine.
But as editor, it’s also my job to ensure the DT is one of those publications that continues to thrive by adapting. That doesn’t mean setting aside our role as a newspaper; more than 10,000 copies of the Daily Trojan circulate each weekday and will continue to do so as long as readers pick them up. Adapting simply means expanding our emphasis on other forms of media, whether it’s through more photography, video or podcasts. And it means expanding our range of content styles and giving ourselves the space to experiment with new forms of journalism and fresh techniques.
Last semester’s editor-in-chief and a great friend of mine, Sean Fitz-Gerald, wrote in his introductory letter that he wanted the DT to be “the sounding board for USC.” I couldn’t agree more, but my support alone can only go so far. That’s why I’m calling on members of the USC community to talk back to us. About what, you ask? About anything — your constructive criticism, ideas for us to report on or to explore, encouragement when you enjoy a story or particular multimedia feature. We want students, parents, professors, deans and department heads to keep us accountable and to trust and work with us to continue the discourse. Our senior staff of 17 and our 150-plus writers work hard to serve the USC community, and in return we need the continued involvement of that community.
Feel free to contact me or any of our sections if you’d like to discuss your thoughts or simply meet the people behind the type; our newsroom is located on the fourth floor of the Student Union. And if you’re passionate about media — any form of media — please to email us about how you can get involved. We want to gather the best talent we can find around campus, whether you’re a pure writer or a cartoonist or a documentary filmmaker. At the very least, we’ll get inspiration from your suggestions.
After all, a dose of inspiration is usually all it takes to push us to do the very best we can, day in, day out. And as long as a USC community exists, we’ll be here — to cover news, to find the best stories and, maybe most critically, to continue to learn from the community itself.

USC men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill was fired Monday morning, athletic director
Pat Haden announced.
O’Neill was midway through his fourth season with the team and compiled a 48-65
record overall. The Trojans are coming off a 76-59 road victory over Utah and
are 7-10 (2-2) on the season.
Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
In a press release, Haden thanked O’Neill for his services but noted that he wanted to
take the program in a different direction.
“It was hard for me to evaluate him as a head coach until this year when he had enough
players and veterans to compete,” Haden said. “As the season progressed, it became
evident to me that we needed new leadership in our men’s basketball program. Despite a
nice road win in our last game, I felt it was best to make a change now, with most of the
Pac-12 season still ahead of us, in order to re-energize our team.”
Assistant Bob Cantu will take over as interim head coach. Cantu has been with the team
since 2000 and was promoted to the position of associate head coach in 2010.
“I feel confident that Bob Cantu will capably guide our team on an interim basis while we
search for a new coach,” Haden said.
The Trojans will return home for a matchup against the No. 21 Oregon Ducks on
Thursday at 8 p.m.
