In the three years since releasing the divisive album Evil Urges, My Morning Jacket’s future seemed uncertain.
Jim James, lead singer, songwriter, guitarist and one of only two members who has been on every album, has kept busy in the group’s downtime, embarking on a series of side projects including a solo EP (under the moniker Yim Yames) and an album and tour with Monsters of Folk, a super group featuring himself, M. Ward, Mike Mogis and Bright Eyes’ Conor Oberst.
Last October, however, the band reunited for a five-day residency at famed New York venue Terminal 5 to play a different album from its catalogue in its entirety each night. The trip down memory lane seemingly rejuvenated James’ interest in working on a new My Morning Jacket project. Back in the studio, James and company cranked out Circuital, which tries to emulate the sound of the band’s first three critically acclaimed albums, while also relying on shorter songs with fewer jam sessions than usual.

The result is a grab bag of tracks that vary in strength. There are a few great songs, but weak tracks predominate on Circuital. Listeners get the sense that these songs — though they disappoint on the album — might work in longer form when played live.
Starting with the one-two punch of the slow-burning “Victory Dance” and raucous title track, “Circuital,” My Morning Jacket wastes no time getting into the groove of things.For the first time since 2005’s Z album, the band seems to be having fun playing together in the studio. On the title track, James croons that his band is Heading right back in the same place / That we started out. Unfortunately, My Morning Jacket fails to recreate the magic of its earlier albums after setting the bar so high with the first two songs.
Too many songs are obviously edited down for time purposes and rely more upon James’ inconsistency as a singer-songwriter rather than the full band’s musical talents, namely “The Day Is Coming” and “Wonderful (The Way I Feel).” After starting out so fast, the band kills the momentum and spends the rest of the album trying to recapture the frenetic pace.
The faster, louder middle part of the album has its own highs, but nothing really distinguishes itself from the pack. Listeners are justified in feeling frustrated by the fuzzed-out guitar solo in “Holdin’ On To Black Metal,” as it flaunts the band’s incredible musicianship in the middle of an otherwise unnecessary song featuring an all-female backing choir.
The strangely sincere tracks, “You Wanna Freak Out” and “Outta My System” have the makings of great live songs but are just so-so on the album, relying on distorted melodies and some of James’ better lyrics. Unlike My Morning Jacket’s past albums, repeated listens to particular songs do not reveal nuances and previously unnoticed intricacies. Upon first listen, these two songs stand out, but only get less and less remarkable with each subsequent listen.
Album closers “Slow Slow Tune” and “Movin’ Away” are two more slow grooves. While the latter ends the album on a delicate and heartfelt note with a beautifully downtrodden piano ballad, the former essentially functions as a lullaby, almost boring listeners to sleep. Pairing the tracks at the end leads to an anticlimactic finish, especially when compared to the album’s explosive introduction.
My Morning Jacket thrives playing songs in live performances where they make adjustments and lengthen their songs with epic jam sessions. Old fans should look forward to hearing how the band plays these new songs live, while prospective fans should look back at the band’s stellar catalogue rather than this shaky release.

With a movie like The Hangover, any follow up would feel forced. The original was so twisted, so hilarious and so extremely out there that putting the four leads through the same situation would raise questions. But director Todd Phillips, who co-wrote the sequel, managed to prevent things from being completely repetitive.

The result is a film that, although not as good as the first installment, offers some humor instead of failing miserably.
Two years after the four members of the “Wolfpack,” as Alan (Zach Galifinakis) calls them, had a wild weekend in Las Vegas, they head to Thailand for Stu’s (Ed Helms) wedding. Despite their best efforts to stay sober, things go awry and they find themselves once again waking up with no memory, and with Stu’s soon-to-be brother-in-law Teddy (Mason Lee) missing.
What follows is a familiar tale, with the guys once again trying to piece together what happened the night before. How that reconstruction is handled is a mixed success. On one hand, the film admirably acknowledges they’ve been through this sort of scenario before, and they try to use their past experiences to help solve the problem.
But on the other, The Hangover Part II seems afraid to stray from elements of the original that were successful.
The film shoehorns the crazed, drugged-up criminal Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) into the adventures, and unlike other times the sequel recalls its predecessor, Chow’s appearances feel unnatural rather than effective.
The true saving grace of the film is how tonally different it is from the first. Whereas The Hangover reviled in the glitz and excess of Las Vegas, Part II explores the wealth disparity and rough edges of Bangkok.
Beyond setting and visuals, the tonal shift in the sequel extends to the music. Instead of the boastful, decadent hip-hop that permeated the first installment, this one features more in the way of slow tunes and country music, including a very fitting Johnny Cash song. Coupled with the squalor the guys awaken to, and the exhausted, heat-driven day they try to get through, the soundtrack is a highlight.
In fact, one thing that really sets both films apart from a standard comedy film is how good they both look. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher captured not only the beautiful coastlines of Thailand but also the rougher edges of the inner slums of Bangkok.
And although the script is stuck in a rut of dealing with the events of the first film, the cast is still a strong point.
Alan aside, the leads feel like regular people caught up in strange situations, making the moments all the more surreal. The banter between the two less zany members of the trio showcases some of the film’s best dialogue, most notably in an early scene between Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu before things go downhill for them in Thailand.
But in some cases the characters seem off.
Alan’s oddities are played up more, and given more screen time, turning him from the twisted dark horse of the Wolfpack to the overdone crazy person. He still has his funny moments, but it goes too far. Similarly, Chow becomes a kind of live action cartoon character.
The film also suffers from the noticeable underrepresentation of potentially strong supporting characters. Teddy isn’t allowed to develop primarily because he’s missing for the bulk of the running time, but Doug (Justin Bartha) is also drastically underused despite not being the one who vanishes this time around.
It feels cheap to compare The Hangover Part II to its predecessor, but when Phillips puts so much stock in sticking to the tried-and-true formula of the original, it’s impossible not to. And there lies the film’s main fault: It can’t fully leave the past behind. When it tries to be its own movie, it works. When it plays up the surreal elements, it fails.
Ultimately, The Hangover Part II manages to justify its being produced but finds itself struggling to avoid rehashing the same plot.
The cast is still fun the second time around, and the film is masterfully made, both visually and musically, but the script sinks it. It is not a comedy classic like the original, but it is a worthwhile watch for any die-hard fans of the Wolfpack.

Practicing poverty law in East Los Angeles and doing the rounds in the city’s spoken word scene might not seem like steps on the usual path toward becoming playwright. But then again, Evangeline Ordaz is not often accused of writing usual plays.
Photo courtesy of Xavi Moreno
Case in point, her latest work, Bordering on Love, charts the platonic love affair that develops between a drag queen and his female stylist, an undocumented immigrant upon whom he becomes fiercely dependent to remain competitive in the drag pageant circuit. The play is produced by Company of Angels in its historic Downtown performance space on the third floor of the Alexandria Hotel, the one-time tenement of such Hollywood legends as Humphrey Bogart, Greta Garbo and Charlie Chaplin. Company of Angels artistic director and Ordaz’s husband Armando Molina is directing the play, which goes into previews on Thursday and will kick off its monthlong run with a proper opening Saturday.
Ordaz, a Boyle Heights native whose father’s job as a helicopter mechanic required relocating the family from East Los Angeles to Southeast Asia for parts of Ordaz’s childhood, completed her undergraduate education at nearby Loyola Marymount University before heading north to study law at UC Berkeley. Upon graduating, she returned to the community of her youth and went to work for the Legal Aid Foundation, an organization providing free legal services to low-income clients in the greater L.A. area.
“My area of expertise was housing and organizational development, but I also did government benefits advocacy,” Ordaz said. “I would represent people in administrative hearings, I would represent people in eviction proceedings in court, consumer law, domestic violence — just anything.”
Even while employed by the Legal Aid Foundation, Ordaz learned to make time for her writing fairly quickly after returning to Los Angeles.
“When I came back to L.A. after law school, I got together with a group of women and we formed a kind of writing workshop,” Ordaz said.
The group didn’t produce much in the way of playwriting, but rather focusing on poetry, prose and spoken word. What began as a writer’s group eventually became a sort of spoken word collective, with the group’s members called themselves ¿Y Qué Más?, Spanish for “And what more?” (“As in ‘And what more could you possibly want? This is us,’” Ordaz explained.)
The women — generally numbering between four and six — started performing around town at coffee shops and in poetry jams, racking up something akin to a following in the process. It was at that point that Ordaz began to visualize her work being brought to life in an even more theatrical sense.
“Once we actually started performing our work and we got to be kind of popular … I started to see words onstage,” Ordaz recalled.
Running around in Los Angeles’ performance circles, Ordaz soon met her husband, Armando Molina, Company of Angels’ current artistic director. Molina introduced Ordaz to the city’s rich theater culture, and together the pair saw more than their fair share of live theater. Not long after, Ordaz continued on the logical trajectory from spoken word poetry to actual playwriting.
And clearly, Ordaz has a wealth of life experience to bring to that writing. Her on-again, off-again work in the legal field — as well as her experience as a community activist — has repeatedly manifested itself in her plays.
“Themes in my plays are always about how societal structures — like legal structures — impact of our day-to-day living, our day-to-day lives,” Ordaz said. “I’m interested in how these things can be at odds.”
Like Bordering on Love, an earlier work by the playwright also confronted the issue of immigration. Visitor’s Guide To Arivaca, which was also directed by Ordaz’s husband Armando Molina, described a situation in which the realities of human needs ran smack-dab into the unforgiving realities of the law. In Visitor’s Guide, immigration policies are utterly out of touch with the realities of people’s lives — and as such, adherence isn’t always an option.
“In some ways it doesn’t change how people live, but in other ways it does, but in a way that’s really detrimental,” Ordaz said.
In Bordering on Love, a gay man named Anthony (drag name: Antoinette) seeks to get an edge on the competition in drag beauty pageants by enlisting the help of a stylist at a nearby beauty college. Marilu Molina, an undocumented immigrant who was turned away at the airport in an effort to get to the United States legally, and only then resorted to smuggling, responds to his posting. From there, the pair develop a friendship that Ordaz describes alternately as dependence and a platonic romance.
Their unusual arrangement comes to a crashing halt when a federal financial aid document on which Marilu misrepresented herself as an American citizen catches up to her, and Anthony must confront the reality of his reliance on the migrant stylist.
With the exception of a visit to a nightclub north of Melrose Avenue in the ’90s, Ordaz had little familiarity with the drag world before writing the play.
“I did research,” Ordaz said.
Although the playwright is a newcomer to the drag world, she is has more than enough experience to accurately capture the plight of society’s marginalized communities.
Bordering on Love seeks to address the apparent injustice of a federal government that only attempts to define marriage in two instances: when discussing immigrants and gays. That’s a tall order, to be sure, but Ordaz’s peculiar platonic love story might just be able to do it.

Following the grand opening of its new $635-million facility, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles announced a partnership to create a new research center to develop medical devices for children in conjunction with USC.
Team effort · USC programs, institutes and faculty from the Health Sciences Campus will partner with Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. - Dieuwertje Kast | Summer Trojan 
Pediatric medical device development often lags behind adult device development as a result of various economic, clinical and regulatory problems, according to Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.
The partnership hopes to ease these concerns as there is an increasing need for children’s medical devices as they differ from adults in terms of size and anatomy.
USC and Children’s Hospital will combine forces among programs, institutes, faculty and students in the new partnership.
“There currently exists a need for novel medical devices specifically designed for [children], as well as for the adaptation and validation of existing adult devices for pediatric use,” Chester Koh, co-director of the new Center for Technology and Innovation in Pediatrics, said in a statement.
Through a “topic-focused, systems-oriented approach,” the center looks to overcome these issues. CTIP will aim to foster innovative pediatric device projects and connect both internal and external resources and people to support the development of such devices.
“Our long-term plans are for the CTIP to sustain a productive pipeline of new pediatric devices at Children’s Hospital and USC so that we can make a difference in the lives of patients right now,” said Brent Polk, chair of pediatrics at the Keck School of Medicine, told Los Angeles Business.
Work by the Children’s Hospital and the UC San Francisco recently identified a protein that might explain why treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common type of childhood cancer, is ineffective for some children.

The fall 2011 freshman class will be the most international in the university’s history and for the first time under half the class is from California.
Director of Admission Kirk Brennan attributed the increase in international students to more students’ applications and more students’ intent to come.
He said admissions received approximately 4,400 international applications this year, compared to 3,500 last year.
Asher Feldman | Summer Trojan
“There’s a trend nationally for international students to be coming to the U.S.,” Brennan said. “We offer a unique set of programs that attract international [students] and have been known to enroll international students at high levels for a long time.”
Additionally, he said generally around 30 percent of accepted international students come to USC, but around 45 percent said they would come in the fall.
“We have, for a couple of years, had some dedicated recruitment staff working on the ground in some of our more popular areas,” Brennan said. “We also have, for the first time, hosted some receptions for admitted students internationally like we do domestically. We had them in six cities in Asia.”
Brennan also said this is also the first year “in anyone’s memory” that will see less than half of its students coming from California.
“We see this as a major shift,” Brennan said. “Decades ago it was probably two-thirds Californian students, so it’s a big deal even to see a single percentage point shift.”
Last year’s freshman class had approximately 52 percent Californians, but Brennan said they anticipate 47 to 48 percent of the class to be California natives.
“It’s a surprise to a lot of people because there’s a long history of Californians coming to USC,” Brennan said. “Southern California’s a great place to live, and studies show people often live near where they went to college. We think people who come to study will come to stay, so it may not change our alumni base too much.”
Both the number of applications and places for the class entering this fall increased. The number of applications increased 4 percent, from 35,794 to 37,164 applications. Admissions expects approximately 2,650 students to enroll this year, compared to 2,600 last year.
The acceptance rate hit an all-time low this year, 22.7 percent, offering 8,450 students admission. Last year’s acceptance rate was 24.3 percent.
The anticipated incoming freshman class is about as ethnically diverse as last year’s class, with 21 percent coming from under-represented minority populations (black, Latino or Native American), compared to last year’s 22 percent.
Brennan also said that USC expects about 15 percent of its students be the first in their families to attend college.
“We’ve also seen a sharp rise in the percentage of first generation college students attending USC in the past couple of years,” Brennan said. “This isn’t something we always think about when we think about USC, but the classroom experience is filled with all different kinds of diversity.”
The same is true of students who are the first in their families to attend college: 13 percent of committed applicants this year and 12 percent of matriculating students last year.
In a press release, USC Dean of Admission Timothy Brunold said he was pleased with this year’s pool of applicants.
“Our incoming freshman class promises to be the highest-quality, most geographically and socio-economically diverse in USC’s 131-year history,” Brunold said.
The university attributed the overall increase in applications in part to the availability of financial aid, which increased this year, and need-blind admission, which admits students regardless of ability to pay. More than 60 percent of the student body currently receives some form of financial aid.
The university increased its undergraduate financial aid budget by 7 percent and plans to distribute more than $200 million.
“As our popularity has grown and reputation has continues to rise, we’ve become more attractive to students in other parts of world both nationally and internationally,” Brennan said.
This conversation is an embarrassment.  You appear to be provincial, ignorant, Californians pretending to have something to say.  89% of the students in the incoming class are from the U.S.  Sure, sometimes universities use the word “diversity” to mean “ethnic diversity.”  That’s totally different, and sometimes over-done.  This is the kind of diversity that is good though, where people were actually raised in other countries.  They add something different to the experience of that other 89%, who are Americans, of the incoming class.
US universities are in the business of slutting for money from international students.  The result is a system destined to educate the rest of the world while our own students miss out on an education.  The influx of foreign students in recent years is sickening.  It is not just at USC.  It is in everywhere, including the “second tier” schools.  They steal seats from deserving US students and then turn around and steal US jobs with their newly bought diplomas.  It is a sad trend.  First our manufacturing and service jobs get sent overseas, and now the invasion is coming here to steal our education opportunities and limited domestic jobs.  Wake up Americans! You are getting screwed at both ends!
Disgusting.  Reprehensible $$$ whoring for the internationals who have money to burn.  Meanwhile, few at USC give a rat’s patootie that the middle-class white kid from say, Iowa or Nebraska or West Virginia, will be overlooked in favor of the foreigner.  They will call it “diversity”, but it is about MONEY.  Then brace for it, folks, because somehow, these internationals will never, ever leave; they will then steal the jobs that your kids should have secured.  Thanks USC for screwing not only the State of California, but for killing off careers all over the nation.
To Kathy: What a petty, mean, completely paranoid comment! “Killing off careers all over the nation”? “Steal the jobs that your kids should have secured?”
Please, lady. Get a grip on reality.
To Ruby,
I think if anybody needs to get a grip it’s you. I work in the healthcare industry and I see how people from certain parts of the world come here, swarm an industry, bring their business practices (which for the most part are unethical) steal the medicare and medi-cal system blind, only do business with their own kind, and take advantage of this country’s “trusting” nature while sending most of their money back to their own countries while providing mediocre service to their clients. Now I am not speaking about any particular nationality or saying that “all” are guilty, believe me we have plenty of unethical people born here as well. What I do see is that many people see diversity as a good thing and LA as a melting pot. In reality LA is a “stew”. We may work together but for the most part we stick with our own socially. We always have to be “politically correct” and the people who suffer the most with accusations of racism or intolerance are those born here…that’s the reality!!
To Trojan Alum:  How many of these people that you are referring to from your experience in the healthcare industry that are “from certain parts of the world” actually attended USC and obtained bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the university? Please provide statistics. This type of fearmongering made by you and Kathy against USC students and graduates is both ignorant and dangerous.
I love how people like you stoop to ad hominem attacks when you lose a debate or can’t see through the brainwashing you received because you cannot discern reality from your politics. What is dangerous about what I said. The danger is that it is happening and people like you will let it and will yell the loudest when it affects YOU.
The truth is that big universities love the non-US students because, 1. they are better educated (does not reflect well on our current California School system…and we all know who pulls those strings…need I say it), and 2. they know that they will pay full tuition and will not be eligible for many scholarships  or in-state discounts that a California student would get. What’s dangerous and ignorant, as you say, is that this country is going down the tubes because we don’t invest well in our own kids. Where are you statistics to tell me I am wrong. By the way, what I wrote about is based on 15 years experience in the field…I don’t need stats. I also have plenty of fraud investigators I work with that see even more than I have. Wake Up Ruby!
Bring on the best and brightest from anywhere.  The second tier have ample educational opportunities at the state supported schools.
And this is a good thing?  I think not.  Why should we educate the world?  What about CA students (or US students for that matter!) who now  lose out on those coveted spots for admission.   USC is just following the trend of the CA state system….money talks, so sad to hear.

Senior Maria Sanchez and freshman Kaitlyn Christian etched their names in the USC record books, as they became the first pairing in program history to advance to the semifinals of the NCAA doubles championship.
Talented · Senior Maria Sanchez (pictured) and freshman Kaitlyn Christian became USC’s first doubles pair to reach the NCAA semifinals. - Summer Trojan file photo 
But when they got there, Clemson’s Josipa Bek and Keri Wong proved to be too much, putting an end to Sanchez and Christian’s stellar doubles campaign.
“When they are playing their very best, I don’t think anyone beats them,” said USC coach Richard Gallien. “It wasn’t a slam dunk that they would win, but I wasn’t surprised that we were in the semifinals.”
Sanchez also expressed happiness at making it so far in the tournament with Christian.
“It was exciting making it to the semis,” she said. “It was a tough match we lost, but overall we had a good season together and I really enjoyed playing with her.”
Sanchez also competed in the singles competition of the tournament, facing off against Baylor’s Diana Nakic in the first round.
The match was delayed almost two hours because of rain. Despite the circumstances, the senior managed to eke out a victory.
Though shaky in the first set, the ITA National Senior Player of the Year and Pac-10 Player of the Year came back to win the second and third sets 6-2. This put Sanchez up against California’s Mari Andersson in the following day.
Sophomore Danielle Lao also beat her opponent from Baylor, Sona Novakoya, in the first round. Lao’s win 6-2, 6-4 moved her in to the round of 32 to face Stanford’s Nicole Gibbs.
But after successful first rounds of play, Sanchez and Lao’s singles journeys ended in the second round.
“Lao had an excellent win,” Gallien said. “She beat the number one girl from Baylor. Maria had such a great year and didn’t play her best tennis. It doesn’t change anything about her wonderful year.”
Sanchez lost to Andersson in two sets, 6-2, 6-3, ending her singles run with USC, as she finished with an overall career singles record of 116-36 and a season record of 36-5.
Lao’s match against Gibbs did not fare much better, with the sophomore suffering a 6-2, 6-1 loss. Lao finished her season with a 26-13 overall record and was also honored as an All-Pac-10 Second Team selection and won the ITA Southwest Regional Singles Champion this season.
With play over this season, the Women of Troy hope things will only get better from here.
“I think they are going to be really tough in the future,” Sanchez said. “They have some good recruits coming in. I’m excited to see how they do.”

Before the 2011 season, a Pac-10 coaches poll had the Trojans ticketed for a ninth-place finish. Despite preseason expectations, or lack thereof, USC had positioned itself to finish as high as fourth in the conference with a final home series sweep of Washington State.
But instead of registering the Trojans’ best Pac-10 finish in 11 years, they finished their 2011 season with a whimper, losing consecutive games to the Cougars after winning the series opener and finished seventh in the conference.

The rubber game of the series came on senior day, but the Trojans did not give the home crowd much to appreciate, losing 13-1. Washington State first baseman Taylor Ard, owner of an outlandish .546 slugging percentage entering the series, added his conference-leading 10th home run of the season.
Senior Logan Odom was the victim of the Cougars’ well-rounded attack on Sunday, as he coughed up six runs in four and one-third innings. The Trojans’ offense did little to support the right-hander, as the team failed to record an extra-base hit during the game amid six singles.
In Saturday afternoon’s contest, junior Austin Wood was unable to put together another quality start, as the Trojans were bludgeoned by the visiting Cougars, 10-2. The right-hander was jettisoned from the game following three and one-third innings in which he surrendered six runs and battled bouts of wildness, walking two batters and hitting an additional two. The Cougars plated seven runs in the fourth inning.
The Trojans’ offense managed to carve out 10 hits but was woefully unsuccessful with runners in scoring position, as they left 10 men on base throughout the course of the game. Junior catcher Kevin Roundtree, junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa, freshman shortstop James Roberts and senior second baseman Joe De Pinto each had multi-hit games.
On paper, it looked like USC’s toughest matchup would come Friday night against Cougars ace Adam Conley. The Trojans, however, managed to cuff Conley for nine hits and four runs in six innings, as the vaunted left-hander only registered one strikeout.
His counterpart, junior right-hander Andrew Triggs, toed the rubber and turned in arguably his best outing of the season, striking out a career-high 13 batters across seven and two-thirds innings of two-run baseball.
Oropesa provided much of the offensive punch in this game with a two-run home run, staking USC to a 4-0 lead in the fifth inning. Roundtree and junior leftfielder Matt Foat rounded out the offensive attack with two hits apiece. Junior right-hander Ben Mount came on in the ninth inning to strike out the Cougars leadoff hitter, Nate Blackham, to seal the 6-2 victory.
Losing two of three to the Cougars brings the Trojans’ season record to 13-14 in conference play, as they finished seventh in the Pac-10, and 25-31 overall.

Well, that was exhausting.
Five years, one month and six days later, and the final chapter to the Reggie Bush era officially closed Thursday morning with the NCAA once again giving USC the cold shoulder, announcing the school’s appeal of last June’s sanctions had been denied.
And it’s about time.
For a case dating back to early 2006, when James Blunt songs were actually played on radio stations, it had become all too tiresome to cipher through stories repeatedly littered with the words “infractions,” “sanctions” and “postseason ban.”
No doubt, following the five-year ordeal, it’s time for USC to move on, no matter how unprecedented, how unwarranted the NCAA Committee on Infractions’ decision was last year regarding USC (a loss of 30 scholarships over three seasons, a two-year postseason bowl ban).
Granted, the outcome was unquestionably unfair, but at this point, nothing is going to change. It’s time to put “Sanctionsgate” in the rearview mirror, time to quit the COI bashing, time to look toward the future.
“We’ll deal with what we’re dealt,” junior quarterback Matt Barkley told a group of reporters last week.
Atop the wish list for many disgruntled fans is a lawsuit against the NCAA, a way to seek damages, a way to expose the inconsistencies and hypocrisies of the governing body of college athletics.
Despite of such a possibility, school officials insist they won’t exercise legal action, not now or at any point in the immediate future.
“The university has considered all the alternatives,” Athletic Director Pat Haden said Thursday. “We are not going to do that. We have decided to kind of move on.”
Suffice to say, not everyone welcomes such a mindset.
“What’s this WE business?” said one fan on the USC message board, Fighton247.com. “[Haden] should say “I” because the Trojan fanbase and I’m sure a large number of the alumni want to keep FIGHTING ON!!!”
But a lawsuit is unquestionably farfetched.
For starters, there is no technical “NCAA.” The organization is complex and composed of a litany of subcommittees, begging the question as to who you actually sue. The enforcement staff? The ones who initially uncovered the findings. The COI? The appeals committee? (The five-member group that ruled the sanctions were acceptable). Or for good measure, NCAA President Mark Emmert?
But all are separate entities (the NCAA president is not responsible for enforcement). In short, putting a lawsuit together is complex.
And who is going to file such a lawsuit? The university? The Board of Trustees? The athletic department? The boosters?
I’m not a legal expert. I can’t tell you that if USC was able to sue the NCAA what the odds of success would be, or whether it’d be practical at all. It’d surely be unprecedented, unheard of in modern-day college athletics. Think about it: a member institution suing a non-profit organization it is a voluntary member of.
And if successful, it’d have the impact to transform the sport 180 degrees. We know that much.
Either way, it’s not on the horizon, and maybe that’s OK.
Call it appeasement, call it raising the white flag, but it is quite possible that after five years, it’s time to turn the page and begin a new chapter.
The initial violations stemming from Bush’s ineligibility date back to 2004 when Barkley and others  were in middle school, learning long division  and signing up for Pop Warner leagues. And for the next three seasons — potentially even longer — they, along with the entire program, will feel the impact of scholarships restrictions and bowl bans.
So why drag it out?
Now that the Trojans won’t be able to feature more than 75 scholarship players for the 2012, 2013 or 2014 seasons or partake in a bowl game come December, as losing the appeal guarantees the initial sanctions will no longer be altered, the only thing left the program stands to gain is monetary benefit.
And considering the distractions this ordeal has caused and the potential it has to detract from the university’s success in the academic realm, it does pose the question as to whether this is an avenue worthy of pursuit.
“I think we need to have a better relationship with the NCAA,” Haden said Thursday.
Considering how the dominoes have fallen over the past year, maybe Haden’s right: It’s time to begin anew.

Most everyone tends to gloss over the injustice of penalizing our senior athletes that committed no wrong doing.  Our school has an obligation to use every recourse available to get the ban lifted on post season play not for the benefit of the school but for the athletes.  
One can make a case that with the sanctions on the football program, we should move on.  But how can we not do every imaginable thing possible to support our senior athletes.  Surely a case can be made that the school has a responsibility to see that our athletes are treated fairly.  
There are multiple other options available to the NCAA to sanction a school or sport.  To target uninvolved athletes is wrong and short sighted. There also seems to be greater outrage by our University on the lose of scholarships than to the injustice to our senior athletes.   For our University to “move on” and not continue efforts to get this corrected is very disappointing.
Its Time for the NCAA to go. College football no longer needs it, it needs to go ASAP.

The USC football program is rarely considered an underdog, but the Trojans surely knew their presentation before the NCAA’s Infractions Appeals Committee on Jan. 22 would be considered a long shot.
Denied · Despite disagreeing with the findings of the NCAA, USC Athletic Director Pat Haden has stated USC will not take legal action. - Summer Trojan file photo 
More than 17 weeks later, the committee announced its decision to uphold all penalties against the Trojans. In the public report, the appeals committee found “no basis on which to reverse the pertinent findings.”
“I am very disappointed, but I am not surprised,” USC Athletic Director Pat Haden said.
The penalties against USC include a two-year postseason ban, and the loss of 30 scholarships over three years. In the appeal, the Trojans requested the penalties be reduced to a one-year postseason bowl ban and the forfeiture of 15 scholarships over three years.
The Trojans will serve the second year of the two-year postseason bowl ban during the 2011 football season.
“I feel badly for our seniors, who had two years of [postseason bowl bans], even though they had nothing to do with what went on,” Haden said.
The university expressed disappointment in the appeals process.
“We are very concerned that the historical value of case precedent and the right to fair process in the NCAA adjudicative process, both in terms of the ability of an institution to defend itself or prove an abuse of discretion on appeal, have been substantially eroded,” President C. L. Max Nikias said in a statement.
Nevertheless, Haden stated USC would accept the penalties and not sue the NCAA.
“We have decided to move on and make the most of our situation,” Haden said. “We disagree with the findings, but I do think that the [NCAA’s Infractions Appeals Committee] itself is fair-minded.”
Haden made it clear the university takes responsibility for the infractions committed by the football program.
“We have to look at ourselves in the mirror here,” Haden said. “We could have, and should have, done things better. We had a player [Reggie Bush] who knowingly did things wrong. We are not innocent here. We deserve some penalties, but it is the severity of the penalties that we think are unfair.”
Haden expects that the 2004 BCS National Championship will be stripped, but that the Trojans will remain 2004 AP National Champions.
Moving forward, he vowed to improve communication and the relationship between the university and the NCAA.
The Trojans held a brief team meeting Thursday morning, with coach Lane Kiffin telling his players to be smart with their social media reactions to the decision.
“Ultimately, there have been a lot of changes that have been made from last year’s team to now in regards to the attitude that the majority of the guys have,” Barkley said. “I definitely think it will turn out better than it did last year.”
Anticipating that he might be handicapped by scholarship restrictions, Kiffin signed 31 players for the 2011 football recruiting class.
“[Kiffin] is going to have challenges that other coaches have not had here,” Haden said. “No matter how many we get going forward, I think we will get a lot of good players. We will have to get a little bit lucky, but I think there is no reason we cannot be competitive.”
The Trojans open the season at home against Minnesota on Sept. 3.
I do not feel that it is right to punish young men just out of high school for something a student did while they were in middle school. I feel that a rule needs to be establish that put all the falt on the player who commited the rule violation. He should be fine where it hurts “the wallet” plus jail time as well as anyone who was involved.

After leading the USC men’s tennis team to an NCAA title for the third year in a row, junior Steve Johnson claimed his own title as the 2011 NCAA singles champion.
Winner · Junior Steve Johnson defeated Tennesse’s Rhyne Williams to capture his first NCAA individual title. Johnson became the first Trojan to capture the singles crown since Cecil Mamiit in 1996 and the 12th in USC history to do so. - Summer Trojan file photo 
Johnson defeated Tennessee’s Rhyne Williams on Monday at Stanford’s Taube Stadium, his 35th consecutive singles win.
The first set was close, with Williams taking the lead, pulling away during the first game after a strong start.
By the second set, Johnson took charge and dominated the final two sets, leaving no doubt who the best player on the court was.
“When I got off that game to go up 2-0 in the third, I was going to do anything it took to hold on,” Johnson said. “I was fortunate enough to hold and hold on the sunny side [of the court] which has been tough all day. Then I was fortunate enough to get that break at 4-1.”
Williams had defeated Johnson 1-6, 6-1, 6-4 during the ITA National Indoor Championship in November.
The final match marked Johnson’s fourth title match this month.
“I still [have] no words to describe this week and the team and now this individual [title],” Johnson said. “It hasn’t sunk in yet and I don’t think it’ll sink in for a while.”
The last Trojan to win the NCAA singles title was Cecil Mamiit in 1996. Johnson became the 12th Trojan to win the title.
“That court was good to us this week,” said USC coach Peter Smith. “It’s indescribable.”
Johnson became USC’s first to win both the team and singles championships in the same year since Joaquin Loyo-Mayo in 1969, and the first player to do so since 2004.

As students at a leading private research university in California, we have a duty to more than simply notice the escalating gap between the rich and the poor in the United States and abroad.
Amy Lee Ketchum | Summer Trojan 
Timothy Smeeding, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who specializes in poverty said to USA Today, “More than other countries, [America] has a very unequal income distribution where compensation goes to the top in a winner-takes-all economy.”
But these income gaps threaten social and economic stability in every country.
Last month, social affairs ministers from around the world met at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Conference Centre in Paris to discuss high and increasing income inequality in their 34 member countries and emerging economies. The meeting provided a step forward to bettering the benefit sharing process through globalization.
Students must utilize their undeniable ability to get involved to carry on the conference’s economic prosperity ideals. Whether it be by becoming a member of the Joint Educational Project on campus or working for Teach for America after graduation, doing so can aid in lowering the disparity between the wealthy and those in poverty. A university education is key to moving up the social ladder.
Teach for America places graduated students in rural and urban public schools with an aim to expand educational opportunity. According to the program’s website, “Our [Teach for America] alumni … [work] to effect the fundamental changes needed to ensure that all children have an equal chance in life.”
JEP works toward the same goal, allowing USC students to learn firsthand about critical issues facing urban communities, especially in our area.
Students can combine coursework with the unique opportunity of volunteering your talent for tutoring with USC ReadersPlus and America Reads/America Counts. Pre-med undergraduates have the option to assist with health services and education.
While we have several opportunities on campus to help ensure the success of our community, larger organizations, such as the OECD, have taken major steps to solidify success on a large scale.
The conference focused primarily on the social impact of the global economic crisis and what governments can do to help children and families promote gender equality and improve pension arrangements.
It provided devastating statistics based on child poverty in the wealthiest 40 countries, which account for 80 percent of world trade and investment. The United States ranks fourth in largest percentage of children who live in poor households, after Turkey, Mexico and Israel.
The convention tackled three main themes: social policies for recovery, responsibility to bettering family income and intergenerational solidarity. In this arena, students can voice their ideas for ways to help the program succeed. Ideas such as integrating the use of technology within every classroom in America are integral to this process.
But if we can take notice of these statistics and the patterns of disparity, it is vital for us as young people, as the future of the economy, to recognize the dedication groups such as the OECD and the United Nations put forth for the future. By doing so, we should be quick to join our own version of giving back for the greater cause with JEP, Teach for America or organizations similar to them. If we can be of assistance in any minor way, we can improve our economy, and those statistics.
Students are placed in a unique position, a position that could ensure the world’s economic prosperity. They are integral to the success of our economy, and it is imperative we get involved and use our knowledge to help those who do not have the same opportunities we are given.

Yes students are placed in a unique position. I would like to see some of these students start doing some pro bono work for the poor in their individual skills.

Last week, the NCAA Infractions Appeals Committee definitively sealed the fate of USC’s football program for the next few years, upholding the penalties originally handed down last June.
The university issued a statement saying it “respectfully, but vehemently” disagreed with the “imposed penalties … that were excessive and inconsistent with established case precedent.”
The ruling is certainly disappointing for die-hard Trojan fans, faculty, alumni and students who want to see the team return to its days of bowl game glory. Some students will graduate with the 2009 Rose Bowl and lackluster 2010 Emerald Bowl as their only postseason football memories.

For those outside the USC bubble, it’s natural to deem this university a “football school.” The sanctions present an opportunity for the university to shake off that stereotype. As an academic institution rich in scholarly history, social diversity and athletic success in many programs aside from football, USC continues to thrive.
Students attend USC for a well-rounded college experience, not just for a college football experience. One is bound to get involved in something aside from Saturday tailgates, whether its music and performing arts, community service, intramurals or one of many other weekend activities.
The school’s national image, however, seems permanently wedded to its reputation for football excellence and the next few years of sanctions should allow for USC to be taken more seriously in the upper echelon of the higher education system.
President C. L. Max Nikias helped catapult the school in a new direction in his first year as president with unprecedented fundraising, including the establishment of the Mork Family Scholars Program with a $110-million donation. Last month Nikias told Bloomberg News the school might raise $1 billion by September and announce another fundraising campaign that same month. Although Tommy Trojan is the emblem of USC, Nikias makes a sweet sidekick.
In April, the university announced that it would move to the Common Application system next fall. The pool of applicants is sure to increase and the admissions rate will take a dip with an increase in competition.
Consistently ranked among the top-25 universities in the country, the campus houses some of the leading undergraduate and graduate programs in the United States, including education, film and engineering. In 2010, The Daily Beast named USC the “hottest college” of the 21st century, and though it sounds like a superficial title, it signifies USC’s growing presence, academically and athletically, in the country.
And even without factoring football into the equation, many of USC’s NCAA Division-I athletic teams are highly touted. The men’s tennis team won its third national championship in a row last week, and Steve Johnson won the NCAA men’s singles title. Men’s water polo won its third consecutive championship last December, while the women’s volleyball team made it to the Final Four.
Students have much to be proud of in this flourishing corridor of Los Angeles, and football games should only add to its enjoyment. Next fall when we make the trek to the Coliseum, we shouldn’t only root on our players. USC gives us much to be proud of, and a football record should not define its measure of success.

Right on Melissa!  Time for a paradigm shift with regards to the perception of USC!  Good article!
