For fans of storied college football programs, a reassuring feeling surfaces every year. Bolstered by NFL Draft hype and heralded recruiting classes, institutions such as USC always feel on the verge of national dominance. This perspective has no reason to falter for Trojan fans this year, as head coach Clay Helton’s squad will more likely than not vie for a spot among the top few programs in the country.
Even though Helton watched a significant group of talented players graduate or leave for the draft over the offseason, he was thrilled to maintain consistency in the coaching ranks.
Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
“To be able to keep all three coordinators in Clancy Pendergast, Tee Martin and John Baxter, I think, was absolutely huge for us,” Helton said at his Pac-12 Media Day press conference.
It’s no surprise Helton values steadiness going into his second full season as head coach. This fall, Helton may solidify his status as the stabilizing force and leader USC has long needed since former head coach Pete Carroll left the program in 2010.
Hired to the coaching staff following Carroll’s departure, the 45-year-old Helton originally served as the quarterbacks coach. In 2013, he took the reins as interim head coach for one game, leading USC to a 45-20 win over Fresno State in the Las Vegas Bowl. 
When former head coach Steve Sarkisian was fired in 2013, Helton was again named interim boss. He proceeded to steer a floundering Trojan team all the way to the Pac-12 Championship game, earning the job permanently in the process. And Helton has fared well to date, with the Trojans boasting a 12-3 conference record during his time at the helm.
Perhaps this is no surprise: The bulk of Helton’s offensive experience has come through his positional coaching over the years, and as a former quarterbacks coach, he surely benefits from having a playmaker like redshirt sophomore signal caller Sam Darnold at his disposal.
The Trojans weren’t predicted to succeed to the extent they did in 2016, but with the emergence of Darnold, his teammates flourished en route to a Rose Bowl victory. The new year marks another opportunity for Darnold to prove his doubters wrong, and Helton has watched his quarterback take strides in the cerebral part of his game. 
“We all see his skillset,” Helton said, “But how he’s approached this off-season from a work-ethic standpoint and trying to progress as a student of the game — our kids see that.”
“Obviously there are some grand expectations for him, but he’s welcomed those,” Helton said. “That’s part of being a USC quarterback. That’s why you come to USC. You’re the face of the program, and you’re the leader of the program.”
While Darnold and Helton steer the offense, defensive coordinator Pendergast and junior linebacker Cameron Smith will spearhead the defense.
Third-year star Smith, who is on the preseason watch lists for the Nagurski Award, Lott IMPACT Trophy and the Bednarik Award, will be responsible for utilizing his top-notch instincts and scheme knowledge. Pendergast will aid Smith as he continues to bring a wealth of NFL knowledge to the Trojan defense.
Despite possessing a strong veteran core, Helton knows that the biggest question facing USC is the team’s lack of experience in some areas. Thus, the head coach stressed that the summer was vital for getting everyone on the same page by the first gameday in September.
“It’s going to take a lot of hard work during camp and a lot of young guys developing in a hurry for us to get there,” Helton said. “But those are always going to be our expectations, and we welcome them.”
Last year, the first few games of the season threw the Trojans into what seemed like an insurmountable deficit. Three losses in the opening four games essentially concluded any preseason national title aspirations USC had. But the Trojans weren’t out of the wider bowl game discussion, and for good reason. By the end of the season, Helton and company had turned it all around.
Still, that’s not the pattern the Trojans want to slip into in 2017.
“You can do all you want in October and November, and we’ve been really good,” Helton said. “But if you don’t start fast, it’s hard to get where you want to be.”
Wins and losses matter too much at an elite college football institution for Helton to lose sight of the bottom line.
“We’re such in a production-based business, and everybody wants instant results,” Helton said. “The reality is this: It’s easy to go from where we were [last year] to No. 3 in the country. It’s harder to go from 3 to 1. And that’s our challenge right now.”

Eleven grueling weeks stand between USC and the end of the regular season. Head coach Clay Helton’s squad will face reigning MAC champion Western Michigan to open the campaign before tackling a remaining schedule that features three teams ranked in the preseason Coaches Poll. At the end of the 11-game gantlet, USC will hope to have three games left to play — the Pac-12 Championship and the College Football Playoff.
Here’s what’s in store for the Trojans in each regular-season matchup this fall:
Steven Kramer | Daily Trojan
Western Michigan
What to watch for: After last year’s season opener resulted in a brutal 52-6 beatdown at the hands of Alabama, the Trojans will be hungry to send a message in their first home game of this season. Western Michigan might seem like the perfect opportunity to set the tone — the team is an unranked, non-conference opponent looking to rebuild after the departure of head coach P.J. Fleck. But the Mustangs will also be hungry to make a mark in one of their toughest games of the season. It should be a sure victory, but that doesn’t mean the Trojans can relax.
Stanford                                                                                                                                                               
What to watch for: The Cardinal will certainly be a different team without the versatile Christian McCaffrey, but this unit still brings a wide variety to the field. Entering the season ranked No. 14, the Cardinal is the second-ranked team in the Pac-12 behind the Trojans. The defense will have to shut down running back Bryce Love, who shouldered the rushing offense after McCaffrey suffered an injury last season. Love notched 129 yards against Notre Dame last season, and he’s expected to easily produce over 1,000 yards for Stanford this season. But against a run-heavy offense, if the Trojans can plug up the line and limit Love’s yardage, they should be able to keep Stanford out of the end zone. 
Texas                                                                                                                                                                     
What to watch for: Although Texas is a non-conference opponent, this game provides a chance for the Trojans to notch two victories against Top-25 teams within the first three weeks of the season. The Longhorns enter the season with a No. 23 ranking, but their team is at a crossroads after the departure of running back D’Onta Foreman and the arrival of new head coach Tom Herman. The USC defense will need to keep an eye on quarterback Shane Buechele, whose hot-and-cold freshman season ended with 2,958 passing yards, 21 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.
Cal
What to watch for: It’s a rebuilding year for Cal, which means that the annual Weekender game should be a celebration for USC fans. This will be the first season for head coach Justin Wilcox, and it will be the Golden Bears’ first game against a ranked opponent after opening the season against North Carolina, Weber State and Mississippi. The Bears still haven’t announced a starting quarterback, eyeing a decision between junior Chase Forrest and sophomore Ross Bowers. Their defense will also feature a first-year coordinator in theface-off against Sam Darnold’s offense.
Washington State
What to watch for: This second-straight road game should be another chance for Darnold to pad his stats and for the defense to do some damage. The Cougars finished last season 8-5 and lost two of their best receivers to the NFL Draft, so their offensive attack will mostly remain on the ground. The team will have a decent defensive front, returning nine of the starters who allowed 406 yards and 26 points per game last season. But a cleanly executed game by the Trojans should end in a decisive victory.
Oregon State
What to watch for: At this point, the Beavers will have had several games against unranked opponents and a tough matchup against Washington to settle into their rhythm for the season. The Trojans should also be similarly settled, with any rough edges on both sides of the ball smoothed out. If running back Ryan Nall stays healthy, Oregon State could give the Trojans something to worry about on the ground. But the Beavers struggled mightily in defending the run game last season, and junior running back Ronald Jones II could have a field day at the Coliseum if Oregon State hasn’t shored up its defensive line.
Utah
What to watch for: This one’s about redemption. Last year, USC almost broke out of its early-season losing slump at Utah only to watch a victory slip through their fingers. It was Darnold’s first game as a starter, and although the 27-31 loss sparked the team’s thundering resurgence, the Trojans left Utah with a bitter taste in their mouths. Currently ranked No. 25, the Utes will always provide a challenge — the team’s defense is smothering, forcing teams to go an average of 7.9 yards on third down last season — but the Trojans will have home-field advantage for this year’s rematch. This will be a date circled on every USC player’s calendar from the start of the season.
Notre Dame
What to watch for: Last year’s home game against Notre Dame was a rain-soaked, high-scoring celebration of a team fully redeemed with Darnold at the helm. This year’s Fighting Irish team isn’t ranked after a dismal 4-8 season. But it’s Notre Dame vs. USC, and it’s in South Bend, where anything can happen. Junior Josh Adams leads a stacked running back corps — he finished last season with 1,768 yards — and the team is returning a deep defensive secondary. Darnold and his offense must remain disciplined to take away the rivalry victory in enemy territory.
Arizona State
What to watch for: The Sun Devils took a brunt of losses last season, going 5-7 and only notching two conference victories. This year, they’re looking to rebuild, but they’ll have their work cut out for them. Arizona State’s two main challenges last season were a lack of passing defense and an inability to block offensively, which play into the main strengths of this year’s Trojan squad. With their quarterback still uncertain and their run game stagnant, the late October game could give USC a moment to take a breather before entering the final stretch of the season.
Arizona
What to watch for: Last year’s Arizona team finished last in the Pac-12 in scoring, which led to the team’s dismal 3-9 finish to the season. The team found its rhythm on defense in the final third of last year’s season, but its lack of offensive production will be confounded by a lack of depth at both the running back and receiver positions. This is another example of a game during which the Trojans must refuse to relax, even against a low-ranked team in the Pac-12. The discipline of a young team helmed by a second-year quarterback may be tested in game situations like this.
Colorado
What to watch for: Heading into the season, Colorado is a bubble team that dropped out of the Top 25 rankings in the middle of summer practices. Last season, the team broke out to win 10 games and barely clinch the Pac-12 South title over the late-blooming Trojans. They’ll be looking to rebuild after the graduation of four-year quarterback Sefo Liufau, but sophomore quarterback Steven Montez will lead a core group of nine returning starters on the attack. Despite being unable to win the South, the Trojans beat Colorado 21-17 last year. Against a young defense, USC will look to repeat the victory in a more dominant style to close out the final quarter of the season.
UCLA
What to watch for: Ending the season with the Bruins is fitting in many ways. The rivalry game could very well decide the victor of the Pac-12 South, sending one team to the conference championship game in Santa Clara. It will also be the first time that Darnold will face off against Josh Rosen after the opposing quarterback sat out last year’s matchup with an injury. Despite his injury, Rosen is predicted to be side-by-side with Darnold in the race for this season’s Heisman. This game will be a shoot-out, and it’s one that Darnold will be hungry to win.

In Los Angeles, it’s all about finding a niche. It’s about making and recreating oneself. It’s all about owning the city, while finding places one can explore and discover — alone or with others. Little personal things, such as having a coffee shop to escape to, or a restaurant with a favorite dish, can help brighten a bad day. For those just embarking on their journeys here at USC, Los Angeles is a city they  will call home for the next four years, so don’t be afraid to go out and experience all it has to offer. 
GALLERY HUNTING
After checking out the Broad,  the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Getty Center and the Getty Villa, stop by smaller galleries, such as Gallery 1988, which specializes in L.A.’s pop culture art, or Thinkspace Gallery, which showcases work from the underground art scene. Because Los Angeles — especially Downtown’s Gallery Row — is an epicenter for art and culture, spending a day gallery hunting will be an enlightening and Instagrammable experience. 
Recommend: Visiting the Getty Villa early in the morning after eating breakfast at the Malibu Pier Café. 
STUDIO TOURS 
From Warner Bros. to Sony, Pictures, tour the famous studio sets and see where the best movies and TV shows are filmed. 
Recommend: Bringing a water bottle and wearing comfortable walking shoes. 
ARCLIGHT CINEMA ON SUNSET BLVD. 
The Arclight Hollywood is a 14-screen multiplex on Sunset Boulevard.
Catch Q&A’s with your favorite actors and directors at the ArcLight Cinema on Sunset Boulevard. Afterward, check out the famous record store Amoeba Music on the corner across the street.
Recommend: Buying your ticket online, just in case you arrive at the theatre and the movie is sold out. 
THEWRAP SCREENINGS
Signing up for TheWrap Screenings comes especially handy during awards season. Pay attention to which screenings come with an after-party invite. 
Avoid: Pushing an Oscar-nominated director out of the way for crab puffs. 
LIVE CONCERTS 
Whether at FYF Fest to catch Frank Ocean live or at the Staples Center to see Lorde, don’t miss out on the chance to see the best artists live in concert. Free concerts are more frequent during the summer, but be on the lookout for more affordable shows, especially from local bands. 
Recommend: Not feeling pressured about missing out on Coachella. 
BECOME A FOODIE 
After checking Yelp reviews and skimming over the restaurant menus, try some of the best, the worst and the “in-between” eateries in Southern California. There are various options for a breakfast, brunch, lunch, tea time, dinner — whatever you’re in the mood for, this city has it. 
Recommend: Eating at Urth Caffé, Eggslut, Joan’s on Third, Sycamore Kitchen, République, Belcampo Burger, Maccheroni Republic, Sage Organic Bistro, In-n-Out Burger, Sugarfish, Gracias Madre and Georgie. 
CAFE AU LAIT, S’IL VOUS PLAIT
Los Angeles is becoming more known for its coffee shops. Find a spot to study, hang out or relax in and seek refuge from all the college stress. 
Recommend: Visiting Organic Honey, Alfred’s, Groundworks Organic Coffee, Blue Bottle Coffee and Coffee Colab. 
HIKING AT ESCONDIDO FALLS 
Los Angeles has amazing hiking destinations and other recreational opportunities. When heavy rain hit Los Angeles in early 2017, the waterfalls began to flow again. Of course, the waterfalls are still there without the rain, but the water doesn’t run as profusely. For the courageous, there is the option to rock climb up to view two other waterfalls. If not, a 45-minute hike through the Malibu Mountains to the first waterfall is still worth it. 
Avoid: Hiking alone, or after sunset.
SUNRISE AT GRIFFITH OBSERVATORY
Head to Griffith Observatory early in the morning to catch the sunrise over Los Angeles. Afterward, go for a hike on one of the several trails at Griffith Park. Recommend: Taking caution of the coyotes and wearing slip-resistant shoes.
MORNING HIKE TO THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN
The first 45 minutes of the Canyon Drive Trail may be a bit rough because of the incline, but once the trail plateaus, the hike is much easier. Or, visit the horse stables here and ride your way up on the back of an Appaloosa. 
Recommend: Bringing an external battery so your phone doesn’t die at the top of the mountain, leaving you stranded. 
CULVER CITY STAIRS
The view of Los Angeles at the Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook is worth the hike up a series of 282 irregularly designed steps. 
Recommend: Taking the easier trail back down. 
THE FULL HOLLYWOOD PACKAGE
Get the classic tourist experience by visiting Madame Tussauds, the Chinese Theatre and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Also, drop by a Hollywood Star ceremony, then buy some old-fashioned souvenirs at local art shops. Later, catch a late-night movie at the iconic Hollywood Forever Cemetery. 
Avoid: Summoning ghosts. 
THE LAST BOOKSTORE
The Last Bookstore is California’s largest new and secondhand book and record store.
The Last Bookstore is the largest record and book store in California. Remember to check out the Arts 7 Rare Book Annex, and pick out a vinyl as well. Try selling, exchanging, or donating old DVDs, CDs, books or records.
Recommend: Attending one of the late night events, which range from theatrical to musical and everything in between.
 
 
DISNEYLAND 
Spend the day at Disneyland with your friends (even if you already know Disney World is a lot better). Don’t forget to buy a pair of Mickey Mouse ears as a souvenir! A
void: Constantly reminding everyone Disney World is a lot better. 
EL MATADOR STATE BEACH
El Matador beach is just off the Pacific Coast Highway, 8 miles west of Malibu.
Go early to explore this Malibu beach. Relax in the cave  for a while or pose on the beautiful rocks for some high-quality Instagram pictures. Then, climb up the cliffs to witness a breathtaking view of the ocean. 
Avoid: Swimming in the water with large, scattered rocks. 
VENICE & SANTA MONICA
Rent some skates or a bike near the Santa Monica Pier, or Venice Beach. Afterward, enjoy a nice seafood lunch by the water, or go shopping on the 3rd Street Promenade. 
Recommend: Strolling along the streets to see some of the talented performers.
Have fun, good luck and Fight On!

The beginning of the semester signals the start of a torrent of academic commitments, late nights and other stressors. To satisfy the inevitable need for a mental break, these four obscure getaways are perfect, affordable weekend escapes. 
HICKSVILLE TRAILER PALACE 
At an undisclosed location deep in Joshua Tree National Park, a two-hour drive from L.A., lies the Hicksville Trailer Palace, an eclectic trailer park retreat and oasis for artists to collaborate and create. Buried in the Mojave Desert, the trailer park’s location is kept a secret until the day before guests’ arrivals; even GPS locators are prohibited. Once past the security gate and down a dirt road, the desolate desert gives way to a well-kempt sanctuary for provincial living: a semicircular display of eight vintage trailers collected and designed by writer and director Morgan Higby Night. Each trailer is personalized and 
embodies a different theme, from the “The Sideshow,” a crimson carnival caboose; to “The Pioneer,” appearing straight out of the Wild West; to “The Fifi,” a whimsically lit Gypsy hideout. Despite their uniqueness, the trailers form a community replete with a pool, rooftop hot tub, fire pits, communal teepee tent, BB gun and archery range, and a full music-recording and film-editing studio.
SOLVANG 
Solvang is Danish for “sunny field.” The city has a population of 5,200 people.
Nestled in the heart of Wine Country, Solvang is an Old World gem immortalized in the Santa Ynez Valley, two and a half hours north of L.A. The little village appears to be frozen in a perpetual Christmastime rapture and state of quaint solitude with its Danish-style architecture, historic windmill and horse-drawn carriage rides. Branching off from the town’s cobblestone main street is a labyrinth of small avenues, walkways, nooks and crannies where visitors can find artisan treasures like wooden clogs, cuckoo clocks and authentic Danish confectionaries. The many mom-and-pop restaurants and local cafes serve homemade treats and superlative wines. Every September, the village also celebrates Danish culture with a parade of costumes, Viking reenactments and Hans Christian Anderson-esque storytelling. A weekend in Solvang is the perfect refuge from the modern world and an opportunity to sample a fairy tale come to life. 
SANTA CATALINA ISLAND 
With a rich history, beach-town vibe and hallmarks of paradise, Santa Catalina Island is a beautiful bet for a well-rounded weekend getaway. Once home to the native Gabrielino people of Southern California for thousands of years, the small, rocky island was popularized by Hollywood luminaries eager for escape and today exudes a relaxing touristy culture. The island is accessible by ferry or helicopter from four ports, the closest of which is Long Beach, a mere half-hour drive from L.A. A short, 22-mile ride from the mainland will bring you to the village-like neighborhoods of Catalina where there are beaches, boardwalks, boutiques, fine dining and a historic art deco casino that hosts special events and doubles as a movie theatre. The remaining 88 percent of the island is made up of protected land, mountains and coastline populated by bald eagles, buffalo, foxes, dolphins and whales with opportunities for nearly every outdoorsy adventure imaginable. Ultimately, the blissful isolation of Santa Catalina Island allows you to leave your worries an ocean away and immerse yourself in a uniquely preserved, small-town pace of life. 
LOS PADRES NATIONAL FOREST & OJAI
Just two hours north of L.A., Los Padres National Forest is home to more than 1,200 miles of maintained hiking trails and 875,000 acres of federally protected wilderness. The park is rife with a wide array of flora and fauna — with desert, redwoods and more than 400 species of wildlife — the land is a nirvana of biodiversity. In addition to such essentials as camping, backpacking, hiking, biking and fishing, the National Forest offers the Sespe Creek Trail, connecting two hot springs to the cozy, pastoral town of Ojai. The rustic destination is blessed with a micro-climate reminiscent of the Mediterranean where everything grows in bounty and local cuisine is always seasonally fresh. Since the 1920s, Ojai has served as a hub for old-school rural living, highly popular among solace seekers. Today, Ojai is similarly a nouveau hippie destination that boasts outdoor recreation, rich vineyards and small businesses run by chefs, artists and healers.

 For his annual summer reading list, President C. L. Max Nikias compiled a list of four books he felt were of exceptional merit. While not mandatory reads, Nikias expressed in a letter to the student body that the works could be used in “creating a common ground for discussions in the coming academic year.”
One of the selections was Tom Stoppard’s play Indian Ink. For the most part, it does an effective job at creating likeable, flawed characters that are made endearing because they never seem to have all the answers. It deconstructs major themes like colonization, sexuality and love by placing human faces on those who deal with these themes on a small scale in their daily lives. As such, the play succeeds when it aims small. The moment it tries to incorporate multiple story lines, it gets tangled in its own web of plot and less-likeable characters. Fortunately, the main story does not try to be grander than it is, allowing the dialogue and quirks of the characters to move the plot along smoothly. There are moments when it gets redundant, but when Indian Ink sticks to its guns, the story is captivating.
Indian Ink follows Flora Crewe, who has her portrait painted by Indian artist Nirad Das in 1930s India. Fifty years later, Nirad’s son seeks out Flora’s sister to discuss the portrait, while Eldon Pike, a biographer, looks for more clues about Flora’s life in India. The work intertwines the three stories to more closely examine colonization and the relationships that can form between people of divergent cultures.
At the center of the play is the relationship between Flora and Nirad. Flora is eccentric and bold, never afraid to share her opinion or confront difficult situations head on. On the other hand, Nirad is playful but passive, content to mirror English culture and keep his head low. Their interactions often follow a pattern, with Nirad trying to please Flora by degrading himself. Flora in turn forces him to examine his actions and understand self-respect. Despite their differences, the two grow close to each other and form a bond that feels genuine to the reader. Their interactions are undercut with tension, but the nature of the play requires their connection to slowly build to a climax, which can get tiresome.

However, Flora’s interactions with other characters prove to be more interesting. On several occasions, Flora encounters the British Raj who has fallen in love with her. Flora engages in a battle of wits with him, as they have differing views of the India that has been created by the British Empire. His unmasked lust for her — coupled with her fiery disposition — leads to an amicable and entertaining discourse. The conversations of Flora and the Raj reveal a deeper truth about colonization and the impact on the colonized. Both characters agree that India was turned into a machine to create profit for the Empire. Yet, by being British themselves, they can only survey the damage from the outside, coming to conjectures based on what little they can guess at. Their sympathies are not misplaced, rather based on incomplete truths that shed partial light on the Indian perspective.
Art becomes the way for characters on both sides of the dividing line to communicate and understand each other. Flora has a soft spot for the erotic, although in the past her sexual expression had been controlled and suppressed by the men in which she was surrounded. Nirad helps her break free by introducing her to the Hindu concept of Rasa. There are nine Rasa that correspond to a specific color and emotion, which in turn are governed by a Hindu deity. The title of the play refers to one of the Rasa represented by an inky blue-black color, which is associated with sex and the god Vishnu. Flora grows to understand and appreciate the blue-black shade and its place in life as she allows her sexuality to blossom and falls in love with Nirad. 
Nirad is at first frightened by Flora’s sexuality, but eventually accepts and even encourages her openness, culminating in his agreement to paint her nude. He also empowers himself by empowering her, creating a way for the two to circumvent their differences and come together in a satisfying way. The scene in which Nirad introduces the Rasa to Flora is a turning point in the play, setting a more interesting mood by having the characters grow frustrated with each other. Instead of going back to the tedious cycle that dominates most of the pair’s scenes, the two try to find a resolution that empowers both of them, with the resulting exchanges becoming increasingly  sensual and intimate.
When the play separates from the main story, the narrative grows confusing. The scenes with Flora’s sister and Nirad’s son provide deeper insight into the impact of colonization but fail to create memorable characters. Even more frustrating are the scenes involving Flora’s biographer, Eldon, who serves as little more than a walking footnote to provide context to certain events in the play. No effort is made to develop him as a character; rather, he seems more a glorified narrator with an inflated sense of importance. 
Indian Ink is a play about relationships, offering an intimate view into the volatile world the characters inhabit. By fleshing out the main themes through character interaction, Stoppard creates a slow-burning, sensual work that illuminates the political turmoil in the background without compromising the plot. The play is at its best when it is showing instead of telling, making for an enthralling read.

Amid the sea of flashy USC lanyards and twin XL packaged sheets, the end of August will bring a wave of new faces to campus. Being thrust into a completely new world that has its own ins and outs, secret language and way of life is intimidating. But for the first semester, students have the ability to choose which facet of USC to absorb. 
The spirit of the Trojan Family manifests itself in different ways for each person. Some people feel it standing in the bleachers with hundreds of their classmates, while others feel it working in the Daily Trojan newsroom late at night. Some people feel it in the streets of Los Angeles, while others feel it in their classrooms or libraries. 
USC is known for the diversity of talent within the student body. Internationally recognized athletes sit in the same seats as professional actors, computer scientists, entrepreneurs and musicians. Frequently, names will appear in publications celebrating a student at USC, routinely reminding the community that there is much to learn from every single person who walks through these doors. Achievements are celebrated in diverse ways and platforms are provided for students of all abilities to shine. 
The most special thing about USC is its ability to allow students to mold their experiences into something entirely different from that of the person sitting next to them. One student can spend their entire college experience buried deep in the depths of Leavey Library, while another can choose to study the nooks and crannies of Los Angeles. Some can find their way to parties every weekend, while others can find themselves on the stage in McClintock Theatre. There are few schools that create such a strong sense of unity while allowing individuality to bloom so prolifically. 
There is no “guide” to succeeding at USC, because every day you have the freedom to make your own choices. There is no secret formula to having the “most USC” time because there is no one thing that defines the experience. 
There are some things that seem universal: the struggle of finding a table at Leavey Library during dead week, the choruses of groans and grumbles about EVK food, the sweltering mid-September heat. However, you might just meet a senior who  has yet to step foot in Leavey, someone who will defend EVK food to the death or someone who moved from somewhere bitterly cold just to sit in that harsh Southern California sun. 
The USC community has a long way to go before it can truly call itself inclusive. Part of being in the Trojan Family is recognizing the faults of the community. Students can then take it upon themselves to bridge the gaps that they see, in the places they are passionate about. But this school has also come a long way in developing  opportunities, presence and accessibility to become a university that allows different types of students to thrive. USC’s strength comes from its diversity, and the school can and should only improve on it as it continues to develop and grow. 
There is no secret formula to success at USC, but students who get the most out of their experiences are the ones who are resolute. At a place where there are unlimited paths, students must be careful and thoughtful in the choices they make, the classes they take, the clubs they join and the people they befriend. 
As all the choices reveal themselves during the first semester and beyond, there is no “right” path. The ability to explore and take risks with a safety net is what college is for, and USC gives students enough independence to learn and grow while they weigh their options.
