Junior defensive end Morgan Breslin was named one of six finalists for the 2012 Ted Hendricks Defensive End of the Year award, the Ted Hendricks Foundation announced Thursday.
Breslin, who is in his first year at USC after transferring from Diablo Valley College, is tied for most sacks in the Pac-12 with 12 and tied for third in tackles for loss in the Pac-12 with 18 this season.
His tackles for loss and sacks is the most by a Trojan since 2003 and have accounted for 172 yards lost by opposing offenses.
Breslin, who made the 2012 All-Pac-12 second team, also has 53 total tackles, four pass deflections and a fumble recovery for the year.
After leading all California junior college players in sacks and tackles for loss in two straight seasons, the 6-foot-2, 250-pound Breslin joined the Trojans in the spring and USC coach Lane Kiffin praised him as one of the team’s biggest surprises this season.
Nick Perry, who Breslin replaced in the USC starting lineup and now plays for the Green Bay Packers in the NFL, was a Hendricks finalist last season.
The other finalists include Florida State’s Cornelius Carradine and Bjoern Werner, LSU’s Sam Montgomery, South Carolina’s Jadeveon Clowney and Texas A&M’s Damontre Moore.
The award is named after Ted Hendricks, a three-time All-American at the University of Miami and NFL Hall of Famer.
The winner will be announced on Dec. 5 and honored at the Hendricks Award Dinner in spring 2013 in Miami.

The Women of Troy won their first road game of the season on Tuesday against UC Santa Barbara 62-51, after splitting four home games to start the regular season. They will now travel to San Diego to take on the Aztecs  Friday night.
Junior forward Cassie Harberts led USC (3-2) against the Gauchos with 17 points, five assists and four rebounds, scoring double digits for the first five games of the season, and freshman guard Jordan Adams finished with 12 points on 4 3-pointers. Harberts is averaging 17.4 points and 8.4 rebounds per game, leading USC in both categories.
“I thought they were great,” associate head coach Daron Park said. “Anytime you go on the road and get a win, you gotta feel good about it. There’s still things we’re continuing to work on every day and there are things we definitely want to identify and get better, but what’s really encouraging about this group is that every game we’re making progress.”
USC has outrebounded all five of its opponents this season, and has turned the ball over 12, 15 and 18 times in their last three games, respectively, after committing 24 turnovers in their first two games. The Aztecs present a different challenge for USC.
“San Diego’s a little bit different than Santa Barbara,” said senior forward Christina Marinacci. “They’re a little more athletic, they have a 6’6” post … We have to really focus in on that and play up to their intensity. They’re gonna be super athletic so we just need to make sure that we do the little things, we box out, we talk on defense and it should handle the athleticism in itself.”
The Aztecs (3-2) played a pair of games last week, beating Auburn 78-57 and losing to Colorado 67-53. They are led in scoring by Courtney Clements with 17.6 points per game, and led in rebounding by Erimma Amarikwa with 6.8 rebounds per game. They won the Mountain West Conference last season, finishing 26-7 and reaching the first round of the NCAA Championships.
“San Diego State’s a really good ball club,” Park said, “They’re tremendously well-coached, they’re very physical, they’re aggressive, they love to try and disrupt you defensively with what they do. We’re working on still running our stuff, being strong with the basketball, being physical when we set screens, all of those tiny things just to ensure that we’re still gonna get good shots tomorrow night.”
The last contest between the two teams was at the Women of Troy Basketball Classic at the Galen Center in 2010, which USC won 74-64 to win the tournament. Ashley Corral led the Women of Troy with 23 points in that game. USC is 28-7 against San Diego State all-time, including winning the past four meetings. The last Aztec win over USC was a 67-66 win in the 1995-96 season.
USC finishes its stretch of road games on Wednesday, Dec. 5 against Fresno State before returning home to take on Texas A&M on Saturday, Dec. 15 at the Galen Center.

The “Drive for Five” has reached its final lap for the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team. Already the first men’s squad to win four consecutive NCAA titles in the pool, the Trojans only need two wins at this weekend’s NCAA Championships to extend the dynasty to five in a row.
Score · Senior driver Michael Rosenthal has won the national title each of his first three seasons. He has scored 28 goals this season. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (27-0) are the top seed and will take on No. 10 Air Force (19-10) in a semifinal matchup Saturday, and provided they win they will take on the winner of the No. 2 UCLA (27-4) and No. 11 St. Francis Brooklyn (16-8) in the championship match.
All matches will be played at USC’s McDonald’s Stadium, with the championship match set for 3:12 p.m. on Sunday on the Pac-12 Networks.
USC won the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament last weekend to earn an automatic berth in the tournament, defeating California 9-5 in the title match. Ranked first in the preseason polls, the Trojans have run the gauntlet, outscoring opponents by an average of 8.6 goals per match and leading the country in most goals scored and least goals allowed per match.
The squad is two wins away from the second undefeated season in program history, but won’t be caught thinking ahead.
“We haven’t done anything yet,” said junior driver Nikola Vavic, who leads the Trojans with 79 goals on the season and is a favorite for National Player of the Year. “This weekend is where all your work finally pays off, but it’s all business until Sunday. [We have] to finish off strong.”
Vavic has teamed with sophomore driver Kostas Genidounias this season to form arguably the nation’s most lethal scoring duo. Genidounias has 62 goals of his own this year, double his total from 2011, and gives the Trojans a 1-2 punch to throw at any opponent.
The Trojans alternated between sophomore Ely Bonilla and junior James Clark in goal all season, but Clark, who played for the Australian National Team at the London Games, has received the nod in all of the Trojans’ match-ups against top squads down the stretch and will start at goalie during the NCAAs.
“Experience,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said about why Clark earned the starting nod. “He’s played in more games, especially playing well in the Olympics against Hungary, one of the best teams in the world.”
The Trojans’ pair of senior captains, Michael Rosenthal and two-meter Matt Burton, anchor the Trojan defense, while three juniors in two-meter Jeremy Davie, driver Stephen Siri and utility Mace Rapsey are among the plethora of other weapons that form USC’s biggest strength: its depth.
“We have great match-ups for everyone on any other team,” Nikola Vavic said. “We go two, three positions deep so we can match up with anyone in the country.”
USC and Air Force haven’t faced off in the pool since 2008, when the Trojans crushed the Falcons 19-1. The Falcons won the Western Water Polo Association title to earn their first NCAA appearance since 1994, and have won 10 of their last 11 matches.
“They’re always in really good shape,” Rosenthal said. “They’re going to counter hard and play a really tough game.”
Air Force comes in on a roll but should have a difficult time knocking off the top-ranked Trojans, who are 15-0 all-time against the Falcons. In their five matches against MPSF squads this season, the Falcons went 0-5, being outscored by an average of 11.2 goals.
UCLA is the heavy favorite in the other semifinal match. Barring a monumental upset, a rematch of the 2011 title match is in the works for Sunday. The Trojans defeated the Bruins 7-4 last year, and have defeated their crosstown foes twice this season, including a 10-9 thriller two weeks ago that clinched USC’s regular season MPSF title.
The Trojans’ record might be perfect, but the team’s performance in the pool is not.
“Our defense has been on and off,” Rosenthal said. “But when we’re on, everyone is communicating really well and we know that with our personnel, we can take out their better players, forcing other guys to beat us.”
Their coach agreed that the team has had its ups and downs.
“I’m surprised we’re undefeated, because of injuries,” Jovan Vavic said. Davie missed six weeks midseason and senior driver Tobias Preuss has also missed significant time. “Other guys have stepped up though, and now we’re better because of that [experience],” added the elder Vavic.
The Trojans have made some slight changes in the line-up from the MPSFs, subbing in a pair of drivers in senior Andrew Reego and sophomore Marc Vonderweidt in place of a pair of two-meters, sophomores Mac Carden and Max Hurst-Mendoza.
“UCLA is a little smaller and quicker than Stanford and other MPSF squads, so we wanted to add some players with excellent speed,” Jovan Vavic said.
For Rosenthal, Burton and Reego, these two games will be their last as Trojans, and nothing would be sweeter than leaving USC with a ring on every finger.
“It’d really be the cherry on top,” Rosenthal said. “My career here has been incredible, almost perfect, and to finish it off with a perfect season and a national championship in front of everyone at ‘SC who’s been there along with us the whole way would be really special.”
For all the excitement and anticipation that comes with a championship on the line, expectations for this weekend are simple for Rosenthal: “We’re going to come out strong and we’re going to beat the Bruins.”

To me, awaiting word on whether USC will play in the Holiday Bowl or Sun Bowl carries about as much intrigue as the Chevron car races we’re forced to watch at every football and basketball game. Frankly, I don’t care, although it is entertaining to watch people go bonkers when the fire truck wins.
I’ll tune into the game and cheer for the outgoing seniors to finish strong, but the bowl game’s outcome will bear far less significance on the program’s future than another winter event: the Jan. 15 deadline for underclassmen to declare for the 2013 NFL draft, held in late April.
Much like last season when core USC juniors Matt Barkley, T.J. McDonald, Matt Kalil and Nick Perry faced the decision to fast-track or postpone their NFL dreams, two standout underclassmen are currently entertaining the thought of departing a year early.
Wide receiver Robert Woods and cornerback Nickell Robey will likely soon submit requests for NFL scout evaluations in hopes of gaining industry feedback on where they can expect to be drafted after this season.
Recent chatter indicates that Woods is leaning ever so slightly toward returning for his senior year and Robey is almost a certified lock to turn pro.
Though neither player asked for — nor needs — my advice, I’ll offer my two cents anyway: I think they have it wrong; it’s in Woods’ best interests to go and Robey’s to stay.
Woods’ desire to play a full four-year career and complete his degree upholds the integrity of the “student-athlete” term and should be commended.
But I would caution Woods that the risk of returning greatly exceeds the reward.
USC’s all-time receptions leader saw his draft stock dip from probable top-10 selection before the season to a possible mid- to late-first round pick in 2013, according to various draft experts. Naturally, some assume that Woods wishes to rebound next season and re-assume his top-prospect mantle.
But several realities complicate that logic.
First, getting drafted in the first round versus the second round makes a big financial difference, and for Woods to hazard slipping even further makes little financial sense.
In 2012, former Baylor wide receiver Kendall Wright received a four-year, $8.2 million contract as the 20th overall pick. Compare that figure to Chicago Bears wide receiver Alshon Jeffery’s four-year, $4.52 million contract, which Jeffery earned as the No. 45 overall pick in the second round. Incredibly, Wright received almost double Jeffery’s contract for getting picked a mere 25 spots ahead of the former Gamecock.
Second, wide receivers invite a lot of contact and often do not enjoy the career longevity of their counterparts at other positions. But even assuming Woods avoids injury, there’s no guarantee his numbers will improve next season, especially with a rookie quarterback at the helm.
Given all the flak USC coach Lane Kiffin received for his predictable and unbalanced play-calling, you can expect to see the Trojans run the ball more often and distribute passes more evenly across their embarrassment of riches at tight end and receiver. Rising junior wide receiver Marqise Lee will almost assuredly continue to overshadow Woods and get drafted ahead of his Gardena Serra teammate in 2014 should he elect to leave early. Not to mention rising sophomore and third receiver Nelson Agholor, as a budding deep threat and game-breaker, will also deserve more targets.
As a result, there appears to be little opportunity for Woods to improve upon his current draft projection by returning for another season.
Curiously enough, many will offer that same argument for Robey: No matter how well he plays in 2013, he won’t get drafted any higher.
Yet, I tend to disagree. Right now, various draft experts rank Robey anywhere between No. 7 and No. 15 among draft eligible cornerbacks, earning him a third round grade. Since most questions about Robey’s NFL potential center around his diminutive 5-foot-8, 165-pound frame and not his play, there’s not much he can do — except experience a growth spurt — to improve his stock, experts argue.
But Robey has yet to maximize his potential and become the Pac-12’s best cornerback. On Monday, the Pac-12 announced its all-conference teams, and Robey checked in on the second team behind three first-team cornerbacks: Oregon’s Ifo Ekpre-Olomu, Oregon State’s Jordan Poyer and Washington’s Desmond Trufant.
Though making the Pac-12’s second team shouldn’t be discounted, Robey’s talent should unquestionably rank him as the conference’s best. For most of the season’s first half, opposing quarterbacks didn’t even bother scrutinizing Robey’s coverage zone, expecting the Florida native to blanket whichever receiver lined up opposite him. But ever since offenses began routinely torching the Trojans’ defense, opposing quarterbacks have started to attack Robey almost as relentlessly as they take advantage of much-maligned junior Torin Harris and sophomore Josh Shaw, who, to be fair, is really a safety masquerading as a cornerback because of depth issues.
If Robey returns to lock down the Pac-12’s best receivers for an entire season, while also flashing more explosiveness on punt returns, his resume would then boast the following: four-year starter, three-time all-Pac-12 performer and two-year captain. In that scenario, it’s not difficult to imagine some team taking a flier on him in the second round.
Undoubtedly, Woods and Robey belong to that rare breed of college football stars who stormed into a national powerhouse’s program as true freshmen, wrested control of a starting position and never made their coaches think twice about re-opening their spots for competition.
The fact that they matched the greatness of their on-field play with infallible character off the field only endears them to USC fans that much more.
No matter what happens, the Trojan faithful should support Woods and Robey’s decisions. That doesn’t mean, however, that the recruiting class of 2010 standouts don’t clearly have choices that would better serve their professional interests.

The USC women’s volleyball team stomped Fairfield in the first round of the NCAA tournament at the Galen Center Thursday night, moving on to play St. Mary’s tomorrow in the next round.
The Women of Troy throttled an overmatched Stags squad in three straight games (25-8, 25-11, 25-10), who didn’t have the height or skill level to compete against the heavily favored home team.
“I really like what our team is doing and we’ve done almost all the hard work and now we are just looking to get better, we have six games and anything less than that will be disappointing,” USC coach Mick Haley said after the match.
In the first set, the Women of Troy roared out to a commanding 6-0 lead as Fairfield seemed overwhelmed by the moment and the height of USC’s frontline. Freshman Samantha Bricio recorded four kills in USC’s first seven points in the match and she ended the 25-8 victory with seven total.
The Women of Troy also got strong contributions out of juniors Sara Shaw and Alexis Olgard. Both players notched three kills in the set, and Olgard spearheaded a spirited effort at the net as USC recorded three team blocks and five overall.
Fairfield came out of the gates in the second set looking more confident in its stride.
The Women of Troy, however, turned a 3-3 tie into a rout with their lead ballooning to 13-3 early on. Behind a well-rounded attack led by sophomore setter Hayley Crone, USC put in a dominating performance on the offensive end. Katie Fuller lead the way with five kills in the set to go along with two service aces and a pair of blocks.
Despite the score, Fairfield continued to show life throughout the set behind sparkplug setter Rachel Romansky. Even with Romansky’s hustle plays, the Stags couldn’t survive with only four kills in the set, and fell 25-11.
USC had a whopping 16 kills and .625 hitting percentage in both of the first two sets.
Fairfield stayed within a few points of USC early on in the the third set and got as close as 8-5.
After a timeout down 13-6, Fairfield could see the match slipping away after a kill by Katie Fuller. The Women of Troy would pull away despite another timeout from Fairfield, winning easily 25-10.
Samantha Bricio ended with a game-high 16 kills as she tacked on four digs. Katie Fuller and Sara Shaw tied for second on the team with nine kills as well.
Though she didn’t blow up the stat sheet despite a game-high 13 digs, Sara Shaw played an excellent match and seemed to be everywhere the Women of Troy needed her to be throughout the three matches.
“She was a nickel-and-dime actor tonight, she played great defense in the first game, passed extremely well in all three game and then hitting was effortless, it really was a masterful performance by her,” Haley said. “Sometimes she goes unnoticed she lacks the quickness attribute of some of the other players, but she is a three-year starter. She’s always right on the spot and never gets frustrated, she’s just a player no matter the situation.”
The Women of Troy are set to face off against St. Mary’s in the second round at the Galen Center on Friday night. The Gaels took down a tough San Diego State team winning a five-set thriller prior to USC’s match.
“We are in no way looking past this St Mary’s team. They play a style of volleyball that’s a little bit different and fun, they’re smaller and quicker and they take advantage of things they do well,” Haley said. “They know how to win and we have a lot of respect for St. Mary’s.”
With a tough game at home Friday night, the Women of Troy will look to continue to build up the confidence they need to make a strong run at their second consecutive Final Four and that elusive fourth national championship.

In the wake of a disappointing five-loss regular season, changes are in fact coming to USC.
Troubled by lingering defensive issues, the Trojans’ assistant head coach Monte Kiffin intends to resign following the team’s bowl game next month, the school announced Thursday night.
Stepping down · Assistant head coach Monte Kiffin will leave USC after three years coaching under his son, Lane. He is expected to return to the NFL, where he previously coached for 26 years. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Kiffin will “pursue opportunities” in the NFL according to the statement. He previously spent 26 years as an assistant, including 13 seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as defensive coordinator.
“I wanted to make this announcement now so that our players who are preparing for the bowl game and our recruits who will be visiting campus are aware,” Kiffin said. “I really enjoyed my time at USC and the opportunity I had to work with our players and coaches. The chance to work for my son, Lane, was unique and memorable, but we always treated each other professionally on a coach-to-coach basis.”
The architect of the famed “Tampa 2” defense, which led the Bucs to a Super Bowl championship in 2003, Kiffin has served as the de facto defensive coordinator for the Trojans since arriving as an assistant in January 2010 along with Lane, the team’s third-year head coach.
“I respect my father’s decision and his desire to return to the NFL,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “We are very appreciative of the hard work and effort that he put in at USC these past three years. He has a tremendous passion for coaching young men and he is a phenomenal recruiter.”
But the Trojans’ defensive unit never quite clicked under the elder Kiffin’s tutelage. In 2010, it allowed, on average, 26.7 points and 400 yards per game, the worst statistical performance in school history.
Though making strides a season later, USC regressed in 2012, ranking 63rd nationally in total defense after surrendering 396.1 yards per game. It gave up an average of 500 yards in each of its five losses — including a record number for points (62), touchdowns (nine) and yards (730) against Oregon on Nov. 3 at the Coliseum. The week prior, versus Arizona, the Trojans gave up 39 points to the Wildcats on 588 yards.
The team’s five losses overall also marked the most for a preseason Associated Press No. 1 team since 1964, when Ole Miss finished 5-5-1.
“Although things didn’t always go as well as we would have liked this year from a defensive and win-loss standpoint, I will leave USC with the utmost respect for the University, the Trojan Family and, most importantly, the players I had the good fortune to coach,” Monte Kiffin said. “I see great things ahead for the USC football program.”
According to the statement, USC plans to find a replacement for the 72-year-old coach.
Added Lane Kiffin: “The timing of this allows us to move forward now in the hiring of a new coach.”
To what capacity a replacement would serve remains unclear. Ed Orgeron is listed as the team’s defensive coordinator, although Monte Kiffin had functioned in that capacity, running defensive meetings and calling the defensive plays for the last three seasons.
It is the other Kifflin who needs to be leaving.  Wonder how many other relatives Lane has on the USC
payroll?  There is this coach named Kevlin Sumlin and his contract is expiring in 3 years…
HOORAY…GET THE HELL OUT OF OUR SCHOOL YOU SCUM BAG.
Yay!!!
Don’t let the door hit you on the butt on the way out
Thank you Monte Kiffin! If it was a corporation you would have been let go a year ago. Give Ed Orgeron the job. We were great on defense under his guidance.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Tuesday, Nov. 27 and Thursday, Nov. 29. 
Crimes against a person
At 4:54 p.m. on Nov. 28, a student reported that an egg struck him on the shoulder while he was riding his bicycle near the intersection of 28th and Orchard streets. The student did not see who threw the egg, and DPS officers were unable to locate any suspects during a subsequent search of the area.
At 3:27 p.m. on Nov. 28, DPS officers responded to a student who was struck by a vehicle while riding his skateboard across the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Royal Street.  The student was not injured. The driver of the vehicle left the scene without stopping to identify him for herself or to check on the student’s welfare.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 9:11 p.m. on Nov. 28, a student reported that he had been placed under undue stress and fears for his safety because of issues related to his roommate’s marijuana use in their apartment at the Annenberg House.
at 5:25 p.m. on Nov. 28, Transportation Services personnel immobilized a faculty member’s vehicle displaying a forged USC parking permit at the Center for Health Professions.  The faculty member contacted the Transportation Services office, agreed to pay all fees and fines and her vehicle was released.
at 3:57 p.m. on Nov. 28, a staff member drove a university tram into a low-hanging tree branch at 37th Place and Watt Way, breaking the passenger side view mirror.
at 1:29 p.m. on Nov. 28, a  student was cited by the Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards for failure to stop for LAPD officers who were attempting to cite her for riding her bicycle against traffic and running a red light near Parking Structure C.
at 1:14 A.m. on Nov. 28, DPS officers responded to a report of a possibly intoxicated student sleeping at Beef Bowl. The student was coherent when awakened by the officers and they concluded she was not in need of medical treatment. The officers then transported the student to her residence and released her into the care of her roommate.
at 7:28 p.m. on Nov. 27, a suspect used a marking pen to write graffiti on a urinal wall inside a restroom on the second floor of the Pertusati University Bookstore.
at 1:31 p.m. on Nov. 27, a suspect cut or broke a section of pipe connected to the water main at the location, causing water to flood an adjacent parking lot and the building vestibule. Department of Water and Power personnel responded to shut off the water main, then Facilities Management Systems personnel were requested to clean up and conduct repairs.
at 11:59 A.m. on Nov. 27, a staff member reported that a suspect forged a prescription on a pad that was possibly removed from the Healthcare Consultation Center II by a former temporary staff member.
at 8:36 A.m. on Nov. 27, an employee at Starbucks reported that a friend of a coworker became verbally abusive and threatened him when he advised the subject that she was unavailable to take his call.
“”at 9:11 p.m. on Nov. 28, a student reported that he had been placed under undue stress and fears for his safety because of issues related to his roommate’s marijuana use in their apartment at the Annenberg House.
That student is the worst person currently living. “undue stress and fears for his safety”? What, he was worried his roommate would get too hungry and eat him?
Second hand pot smoke is filled with toxins!
You got the time wrong, he called in at 4:20
1)  When I was a child and we threw eggs at the passing horse drawn carriages, no one ever bothered to search for us.
2) Marijuana is supposed to relieve stress.  
3) I suggest not eating at Beef Bowl either.
4) Try not to break the pipe when laying it.
5) Dude, she’s working the Frappuccino machine.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — The transition to a digital society is negatively threatening and marginalizing those at the bottom, Annenberg Dean Ernest J. Wilson III said at the Harvard University W.E.B. Du Bois Lecture Series this week.
The digital age · Dean Ernest J. Wilson III analyzes digital-era technologies and their impact on culture in a lecture at Harvard University. – Eric Burse | Daily Trojan
By delivering the three-day lecture series, which ended Thursday, Wilson joined previous Du Bois lecturers, including former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Cornel West, a prominent professor in Princeton University’s Center for African-American Studies.
The lecture series is named after scholar, writer, editor and civil rights pioneer W.E.B. Du Bois, the first African American to receive a Ph.D. from Harvard University.
Wilson’s remarks during the series focused on his study of a wide variety of contemporary digital-era issues.
Wilson described a “scissor effect” in which minority ownership, control and content in media assets has decreased with the growth of media dominance and importance. In 2009, Wilson said, African-Americans owned 1 percent of media properties. Today, that number has declined to 0.7 percent.
“We should care about this because we are citizens and these are matters of the life and death of democracy,” Wilson said. “The number of African-Americans and other people of color in positions of senior leadership and ownership of media properties is either stagnant or declining.”
Brandon Terry, a post-doctoral student at Harvard, said Wilson’s talk touched upon a very pertinent issue.
“Dean Wilson is tackling probably the most crucial issue in politics and economics right now,” Terry said. “We’re on the cusp of an enormous transformation of economy and society which is brought on by digital innovation.”
Wilson’s remarks considered how Du Bois would react and think about this new digital divide. Wilson set up a website, www.DigitalDubois.net several weeks before the series. On the site, Wilson posted four questions, including how the introduction of new communication technologies has affected the African-American community and what the impact has been on minority interaction with other communities.
Benjamin Todd Jealous, CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was among those who listed responses.
“Du Bois was a communicator’s communicator,” Jealous wrote. “I have no doubt that Du Bois would use digital media and mobile technology to do what he did in his prime — reach out, inspire, unify and activate members of the black community and people of good conscience of all colors.”
Michael Copps, a senior adviser for Common Cause, also contributed a post to the website.
“Broadband is the essential infrastructure of the Twenty-first century,” Copps wrote. “This is a civil rights issue — perhaps the preeminent one confronting us right now, because the outcome of so many other great challenges resides on how we deal with this one. Du Bois would have recognized this … we should recognize it, too.”
In his closing remarks before a lecture room filled with Harvard students and academics, Wilson said giving the lectures was not just a professional pleasure, but a personal one.
Wilson’s grandfather graduated from Harvard in 1910 when Du Bois was still a student there. A picture of Wilson’s grandfather alongside Du Bois was displayed on screens during the event.
[Correction: A previous version of this article stated Wilson’s grandfather gradated from Harvard in 1910 when Du Bois was a student there. Du Bois received a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1895.]
“What I want to accomplish with these lectures is inspiring a rethinking of our political agenda on the topic,” Wilson said. “These issues are so important for the  future of America and for people of color to a transition of an information-based society. This is an issue much too important to be left up to economists and policy makers.”

Online gossip, hurt feelings, bullying — as a generation that grew up on the internet, most college students have felt the burn of a nasty anonymous email or message.
Enter “USC Compliments,” a new Facebook page created by a group of anonymous USC students that allows the USC Facebook community to spread kindness by messaging the account with a compliment for a fellow Trojan. The administrators then post the comment on their page with the name of the compliment’s recipient, leaving the sender completely anonymous.
Two administrators, who asked to remain anonymous, said they created the page in hopes of counteracting the online bullying that happens far too often on the Internet.
“So much gossip and bullying occurs on social networking sites these days, and we are hoping to do our part to help people realize that a positive word can be so much more transforming than a negative one,” the administrators said in an interview Thursday.
After only three days of operation, the administrators have posted more than 150 compliments and have received a great amount of positive feedback from students and faculty. Kate Kulaga, a freshman majoring in architecture, says that USC Compliments has already been a helpful force in the USC community.
“USC Compliments is an amazing idea because though it has the potential to be funny to read, it really just creates a positive environment through which students can feel closer to the Trojan community,” Kulaga said. “It is such a great portal for acknowledging people’s positive traits and expressing opinions, especially when it’s anonymous because there’s sort of a ‘no shame’ type of attitude when posting.”
Many students who have received compliments are also supportive of the page, claiming that a single Facebook post changed the outcome of their entire day as well as their outlook on USC in general. Christie Cyprus, an undeclared freshman, said the page demonstrates a certain sense of community within the Trojan Family.
“I’m really glad the USC Compliments page was started, as it really does make a positive impact on the community,” Cyprus said Wednesday, after receiving a compliment earlier that day. “When students see nice things written about themselves and fellow students, it inspires them to want to compliment others and share their appreciation. Overall, it seems to promote a much more encouraging and friendly environment.”
Some administrators have noticed the facebook page, as well. Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs Gene Bickers said he first heard of USC Compliments when a former student submitted a post about him.
“I think it’s a really nice idea. It actually made me feel good. It was the highlight of my day,” Bickers said on Wednesday.
Other students, however, find the page slightly overbearing at times. Milan Bhatt, a sophomore majoring in economics, said that he is starting to regret liking the page on Facebook.
“I think it’s a good idea, but to be honest, I’m considering defriending the page,” Bhatt said. “My news feed is constantly flooded with posts about people I don’t know – I can barely find anything on my Facebook about my friends while I’m still connected to the page.”
Nonetheless, the response to USC Compliments has been overwhelmingly positive, according to the page’s administrators. And nice words about their peers have not been the only good thing to come out of the page — the administrators said the page has morphed into a place for USC students to meet online.
“We’ve also noticed that new friendships have been triggered as a result of the page; for example, the recipients of the compliments will sometimes comment asking to meet up or exchange numbers with the person who sent the message,” the administrators said.
Administrators of the USC Compliments page hope it is the start of a broader promotion kindness around campus.
“We want to show all of USC how far kindness can truly go, and we think this Facebook page is a great way to start,” the administrators said. “We have both been so shocked by the positive response to the page, and we’re excited to see where it goes.”

Members of the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation and supporters from the USC community gathered around Tommy Trojan on Thursday in remembrance of the 289 Pakistani workers who died in a factory fire in September.
Remembrance · Students held white roses and photos of workers who were killed in a factory fire in Pakistan to encourage the university to sign onto the Worker Rights Consortium. – Grace Ko | Daily Trojan
SCALE’s current initiative is to encourage USC President C. L. Max Nikias to join the Worker Rights Consortium, a labor rights organization that investigates working conditions at factories.
The group claimed that the Pakistani factory used the monitor UL Responsible Sourcing, which they said has ties to the production of USC apparel.
Director of Trademark Licensing and Social Responsibility at USC Matt Curran said UL Responsible Sourcing did a one-day compliance assessment of the factory for KiK, a German retailer.  The assessment took place nine months before the fire occured and was the only time UL Responsible Sourcing audited the factory, Curran said.
Curran also said the factory does not produce any USC products.
Two men who were involved in the factory’s daily operations are being held in jail pending judicial inquiry, according to The News International, Pakistan’s largest English newspaper.
During one part of the candlelight vigil, SCALE member Sarah Newell read a statement while the entire gathering repeated the statement.
“What we are asking is simple,” Newell said. “We have a responsibility to use the power of our student voice to demand changes for better and safer workplaces that make USC apparel. The Trojan Family consists of everyone from President Nikias to students to our dining hall workers to the garment workers who sew our apparel. The Trojan Family doesn’t end at the borders of our campus.”
Members of the Sirens, USC’s all-female a cappella group, joined SCALE and sang at the vigil to show their support for the vigil.
Newell highlighted the importance of USC groups working together to address labor exploitation.
“We would like to invite the student body to stand with us and ask the administration to sign on to the WRC,” Newell said. “We love USC, we want to be able to wear our Trojan clothes with pride [and] we want to not be ashamed that they’re made in sweat shops.”
Fight On!
the scale fools are back protecting socialist dictatorships and terrorists states.   Thank you all for keeping your clothing on this time.
Fight On!

Students residing in University Gateway received notice Wednesday that Fresh & Easy Neighborhood Market applied in September for a permit to sell wine and beer.
Fresh & Easy, located on the ground floor of University Gateway on Jefferson Boulevard, alerted residents that the request for the permit would be presented at a public hearing on Dec. 19 for those interested in speaking either for or against the permit’s approval.
With the permit, the store could sell wine and beer for outside consumption in their original containers, according to the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. However, minors would still be allowed on the premises. Fresh & Easy requested to be able to sell beer and wine between the hours of 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. for off-site consumption seven days a week.
In order to be issued a permit, applications must be submitted to the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. According to the department, the number of beer and wine licenses that might be issued in a city or county in combination with off-sale general licenses is limited to one license for every 1,250 people.
As of Aug. 9, the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control announced that, based on statutory authorizations and limitations, Los Angeles county would be eligible for 25 additional off-sale licenses. Most underclassmen seemed to be neither in favor of nor against Fresh & Easy’s application for the permit.
To Nikolas Gutierrez-Kovner, a freshman majoring in film and television production, he said the change would have no affect on him as a minor.
“I’m indifferent as to whether or not Fresh & Easy gets a liquor license,” Gutierrez said. “I’m an undergraduate, so I can’t buy liquor anyway.”
Undeclared freshman Kate Hinkens expressed similar views, citing the easy accessibility to alcohol regardless of whether Fresh & Easy attains the alcohol license or not.
“I don’t think it really matters if Fresh & Easy gets a liquor license or not because there’s so many other places where alcohol is available for people to buy,” Hinkins said. “So it doesn’t affect me either way.”
Most upperclassmen, however, applauded the idea of Fresh & Easy selling alcohol. To Gateway resident Bess Benhamou, a senior majoring in business administration, the permit would make purchasing alcohol more convenient.
“It’s a great idea that they’re going to have it; it’s super convenient,” Benhamou said. “I mean they’ll still card, so I don’t see any downside to it.”
Gateway resident Sara Lanier, a junior majoring in neuroscience, also approved of Fresh & Easy getting the permit. She believes, however, that Fresh & Easy would have to make its prices competitive.
“Fresh & Easy getting a liquor license is an awesome idea,” Lanier said. “They are kind of overpriced in general because of the convenience factor. If they can’t compete with CVS’s liquor prices since you can just go down to CVS to get alcohol, then I don’t know how much more they’re going to sell.”
The hearing is scheduled to be held Dec. 19 at 11:30 a.m. at Los Angeles City Hall.

Every month at the Regent Landmark Theater in Los Angeles, a very dedicated group of fans gathers to pay homage to a film unlike any other. It’s not a seminal work from a respected auteur or renowned cult classic — the sort of movies that usually deserve such treatment. No, these people are here to see what might very well be the worst film of all time.
Released in 2003, The Room was written and directed by Tommy Wiseau, a spectacularly poor filmmaker lacking any self-awareness and who refuses to elaborate on the exact origins of his thick yet impossible-to-place accent. His magnum opus tells the story of Johnny (played by Wiseau, naturally), a well-meaning man whose life would be perfect if his ungrateful fiancee didn’t cheat on him with his best friend out of boredom. The film chronicles the unraveling of their relationship and the earth-shattering consequences of her infidelity. But despite the potential of its dramatic elements, The Room is, by even the most forgiving standards, terrible on a nearly awe-inspiring level.
From the nonsensical script that introduces and abandons narrative elements at random to the abysmal acting, the universally laughable dialogue and a complete misunderstanding of how a movie should be filmed, The Room is not merely bad. If “bad” sufficed as a description, the film would quickly have been forgotten. But by failing in every conceivable way so spectacularly and — above all — so hilariously, The Room took on a life of its own.
Plenty of people enjoy bad movies despite being perfectly aware they’re bad. The simple truth is that there are few better recipes for successful comedy than failed drama, and on that level few can hope to match The Room in terms of unintentional hilarity. It didn’t take long for word to spread and for Wiseau’s movie to gain a level of infamy unseen since the likes of Troll 2.
Then, the Laemmle Theater capitalized on The Room’s unusual popularity. With two night-screenings every month, the Laemmle would show The Room in up to five theaters simultaneously, depending on how many people attended. The Laemmle has since closed, but the screenings continue, and the fans show up every time to enact the ritual that is viewing The Room, a grand tradition evocative of Rocky Horror Picture Show screenings — except whereas that film is genuinely beloved, fans of The Room are there to ridicule it.
They shout at the screen, talking back to the characters and mocking the glaring inconsistencies. They take a “seventh inning stretch” during the film’s third sex scene, leaving their seats and the theater until the several minutes of poorly shot lovemaking have concluded. The most ridiculous and celebrated custom involves hurling hundreds of plastic spoons at the screen every time a corresponding photograph appears in Johnny’s apartment (which happens about a dozen times). Anyone interested in checking out the screening is more or less required to go twice — once to learn all of the recurring jokes and again to act out the traditions for themselves.
And how does Tommy Wiseau feel about the status his film has attained? Just ask him. Tommy attends the majority of screenings in person, tossing around footballs with fans, high-fiving everyone and doing a Q & A in each theater before the main event. Just don’t go looking for enlightenment: Instead of shedding light on his origins, detailing what went on behind the scenes or explaining how exactly he spent $6 million on one of the cheapest looking movies released this century, he gives confusing and contradictory half-answers that shed zero light on any sort of specifics while making it abundantly clear that, yes, this is the man who made The Room a reality.
It’s a bizarre experience, to say the least, but as caustic as some of the insults toward the film can be, the entire affair has a pervading atmosphere of camaraderie and good intentions. Everyone gathers together to celebrate something, something that by all right should never have inspired this level of devotion. It just goes to show that there’s no telling how people will respond to a particular creation. And that artwork, be it cinematic or otherwise, will take on a life of its own as fans form their own miniature culture surrounding what they love.
A perfect embodiment of that phenomenon, The Room remains a strangely uplifting example. It’s a gleeful celebration of the ridiculous; a testament to how much enjoyment people can get out of something done with pure, naive or, in this case, hopelessly deficient intentions. There’s just nothing quite so fulfilling as a group of people coming together to share and experience something that they all enjoy — even if that thing happens to be astonishingly stupid. Fandom isn’t about the quality of the content so much as the quality of the community. The Room might be terrible, but its fans have made it into something great.

“Exit here for Universal Studios, CityWalk and Campo de Cahuenga.”
Metro Red Line riders hear this every day at the Universal City station, but as most visitors use this stop to catch the shuttle up to CityWalk and Universal Studios, they miss one of Los Angeles’ most important historic and cultural monuments.
Slice of history · Angelenos can visit a replica of the Campo de Cahuenga, a 19th-century ranchero from the Mexican-American War. – Stephanie Byrd | Daily Trojan
Tucked away behind a wrought-iron fence and sandwiched between the station’s north side entrance and the Park and Ride lot, the Campo de Cahuenga, a 19th-century adobe home, offers Angelenos a glimpse into California’s history.
The first thing visitors should be aware of is that the building housed on the site is a commemorative structure, not the original Campo. The new structure, dedicated in 1950 as an interpretive replica using the same style as the original Campo, acts today as an informational visitor’s center with special exhibits.
Scholars have dated the original adobe’s construction date sometime between 1795 and 1810, but it has long been demolished. The exact date of the building’s disappearance is unknown, but by 1900 the area was covered in fruit orchards and the home had vanished.
The Campo was first a part of Mission San Fernando’s rancho extensions into the L.A. pueblo, but its claim to fame is the 1847 “Articles of Capitulation” that ended hostilities of the Mexican-American War (1846-1848) in California, paving the way for California to become a state in 1850.
Leading up to the treaty, American commanders Stockton and Kearney organized an effort to acquire Los Angeles by having forces march from both San Diego and Monterey to attack the city from both the north and the south. John C. Fremont, who was leading the  force from Monterey, was approached by the severely outnumbered Californio leader Andres Pico.
The Campo de Cahuenga Historical Memorial Association,  as the operator of the museum,   hosts an annual re-enactment event for the public to experience this special piece of California history.
“The document was signed on January 13, 1847,” staff member Beth Perrin said. “Every year we do a commemoration of that signing. We have actors who do a re-enactment, we have dancers, we shoot off a canon. It’s just a fun-filled day.”
The event, free to the public, marks one of the organization’s biggest events every year. This upcoming year, it will take place on Sunday, Jan.13.
Though the treaty is the most well-known event to occur at the Campo, the Campo de Cahuenga Historical Memorial Association also advocates for other periods of the Campo’s history.
“The Campo is actually the site of a few interesting things,” Perrin said. “There was a stagecoach stop here. There was a Civil War encampment here. It’s quite significant historically.”
The current visitor’s center works to illustrate the Campo’s long, complex history. Friendly staff members and volunteers help showcase several paintings and items that bring the history of the site to a relatable and approachable level for visitors with an exceptionally appropriate exhibit on the flags of California.
Since many scholars consider the Campo the birthplace of California, what better way to display such an honor than through a series of flags that have flown over the region?
“12 Flags Over California” features the expected amount of flags. It seems natural to include the Spanish (flown 1542-1785), Mexican Republic (flown 1823-1846) and First Bear flags (first flown 1846), but it’s a nice surprise to also feature the Russian and Russian-American flags (both flown 1812-1842), which highlight the Russian trade interests and influences in the L.A. region.
The Campo’s history and significance remains constant, with 1997 Metro construction for the Red Line unearthing original foundation stones that hadn’t seen the light of day in more than 100 years. Through Metro excavations underneath Lankershim Boulevard, a large portion of the original Campo has been recovered. Since the Campo runs through Lankershim Boulevard, reconstruction efforts would be simply impossible. After the excavations, however, stones have been placed in the sidewalk and in Lankershim Boulevard to delineate where the original structure stood. And with similar markers hinting at the home’s 19th-century tile pattern, guests can imagine the home in its contemporary context without obstructing a major vehicular artery through Los Angeles.
Visitors will notice the sudden cut of the stones at the halfway point across Lankershim. This area marked the end of the Metro impact zone during excavation, but Perrin shows faith in the continuation of the project.
“We know that it goes at least halfway across Lankershim, but the other half has not been excavated,” she said. “We don’t know if it goes further, but we believe that it does.”
The only true fault of the museum is its hours. Unfortunately, the museum is only open the first Saturday of every month, from noon to 4 p.m. With its strong relevance to the state and national history, this site deserves the attendance and full attention of Angelenos.
And with finals  just around the corner during the museum’s operating hours on Dec. 1, it’s important for students to remember to take some time for themselves and to take a break. This semester, let the Campo de Cahuenga be that escape.

During the last few years, Trojans have witnessed many developments in food options on and around campus. The Lot, a makeshift lunch hangout of years past, made way for the Ronald Tutor Campus Center in terms of on-campus dining. And yes, there was a time when Superior was the only grocery store within walking distance of most student housing. But despite this diversification, students have still been searching for communal weekend brunches outside on-campus dining halls.
Breakfast beverages · Bacaro, the ever-expanding wine bar close to USC, began serving a brunch last month. The bellinis and sangria pitchers, priced for the budget-minded college student, have been a major draw. – Chris Sanchez | Daily Trojan
One of the most popular local spots is just a walk or Campus Cruiser ride away: A little wine bar called Bacaro LA has become beloved for its evening sangria pitchers and small plates. Now, following its recent expansion, Bacaro is aiming to fill the brunch void left in the dining scene.
In November, the restaurant began offering its once-monthly “Morning After Club” brunch, scheduled to take place on the first Sunday of every month from 11 a.m to 3 p.m. Judging by the crowd of 150 that came out in support of its first installation, Bacaro’s new expansion is bound to become a USC tradition.
“Our goal, long-term, is to be serving lunch and to offer more and better options around USC,” Executive Chef Lior Hillel said. “We wanted to start with once a month to see the reaction, but ideally we would do it every week or every other week in the future.”
The brunch menu is a well-edited selection of 12 plates that ranges from sweet to savory and light to all-out filling, covering all the bases when it comes to breakfast preferences.
“The menu is composed of things I like for breakfast,” Hillel said. “There are vegetarian and vegan options; we have customers with dietary restrictions, and we wanted to create something for them, too.”
Vegan is anything but boring in this case. The yam cakes with poblano pepper pesto and market beets, which resemble a plate of savory miniature pancakes, is one of the most unique menu items that foodies — vegan or not — will eat up. By popular demand, the restaurant’s famous “Bacaro Burger” also appears on the morning menu.
Savory items are the cornerstone of the brunch menu and come with a choice of plain, seasoned or sweet chili potatoes. There’s no going home hungry with the steak ‘n’ eggs or the club sandwich smothered in homemade chipotle sauce as options, proving that a small-plates restaurant can curb even the largest of appetites.
All this hearty fare is not to say more traditional breakfast dishes like omelettes, French toast and pancakes are neglected. Eggs are prepared in a variety of ways or served in combination with bacon and a pancake. The pancake dish itself, which the restaurant named “griddle cakes,” comes with granola, yogurt, berries and whipped honey cardamom, the same spice used in the night menu’s to-die-for cookie dough dessert.
While the food is exemplary, students will admit the real draw is the $1 drink specials (yes, $1): Strawberry bellinis, mimosas, Bloody Marys and sangria are served on the cheap for the entirety of the meal. Even with all breakfast items priced at $10.95, the total should come out to quite a bit under what most breakfast spots Downtown would charge.
“We wanted to bring people in with affordable drinks,” Hillel said. “Our main customers are students, and we know that it relates to their budget.”
The Morning After Club on Dec. 2 will no longer take reservations, but a little wait can be made enjoyable with a drink (or two or three) at the bar before being seated. All the drink mixes with the exception of the orange juice are made in-house, an impressive feat considering the amount flowing to keep up thirsty diners.
“We’re the only location that offers booze during lunch,” Hillel said. “I think it’s a pretty good deal.”
It would be a good deal any day of the week, but what better way to celebrate the last week of a semester’s classes than with a few morning cocktails with some friends? Whether you are there to ward off the effects of Saturday night or just want to enjoy some quality feasting, Bacaro’s Morning After Club satisfies.
“We had overall positive reviews at our first one,” Hillel said. “We’ve taken suggestions, and we look forward to a busy one Dec. 2.”

The last year at USC has been marked by two major violent crimes: the tragic killings of two graduate students in April and the shooting on Halloween night.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
USC was also marked by increased security measures, both on and off campus. The Los Angeles Police Department added extra patrols in addition to 30 officers, a detective and a neighborhood prosecutor to the USC area in April. The week after the Halloween shooting, President C. L. Max Nikias announced various new security measures that would be put in place in the upcoming spring semester, ranging from restricting campus access from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. to checking all IDs after 9 p.m. and installing additional security cameras at entrances and around the perimeter of campus.
These are all commendable efforts, but are responses to the most visible — and arguably the most aberrational — incidents of crime at USC. But they put an unnecessary spotlight on isolated incidents caused by individual decisions that are out of the university’s control, and as a consequence, launch the university down a slippery slope of overdone, stringent security measures.
The univeristy must react to crime-related incidents, no matter how isolated they are. But it also must work to strike a blance between immediately amping up university security and finding long-term solutions to issues of crime and safety.
The fatal shooting of Ying Wu and Ming Qu in April dealt a shocking and heartbreaking blow to the USC community. The university responded appropriately by increasing the number of “yellow jackets” in the area surrounding campus who are equipped with radios so they can immediately contact DPS or LAPD. LAPD’s increased presence also helped assuage the fears of students, parents, faculty and staff that a similar incident could happen again.
After the Halloween shooting, Nikias immediately reformed the university’s policy on events, banning the use of any outside promoters for events on campus or on The Row and making clear that the process to get events approved would be a difficult one. These kinds of events receive the most visibility, attention and criticism from inside and outside the USC community, and as a result, the strong action taken by the university was warranted.
But what’s lost in all the media coverage and heightened visibility about the danger surrounding USC is that both the shootings were caused by individuals unaffiliated with the university, who made decisions completely out of the university’s control. How much can new security measures really do to prevent the unpredictable decisions of individuals?
This is not to say that all attempts at improving security should be abandoned because so much is out of the university’s control. But there are only so many truly effective measures USC can implement, and if we continue at the rate we are going, such measures will become increasingly ineffective and superfluous. It also sets a dangerous precedent when concerned parents and families, who are removed from USC and — for the most part — only hear about these isolated incidents, are clamoring for the university to better protect their children. What if enough parents signed a petition pressuring Nikias to make USC a closed campus and he agreed? Such a change would be irreversibly detrimental to students and faculty, as well as to the valuable relationship the university has built with the surrounding community.
When it comes to the issue of crime and safety at USC, the balance between taking immediate action and making long-term foundational changes is difficult to find but absolutely necessary. But moving forward into next semester and the years to come, it is crucial for the university to remember this and to not get caught up in the immediacy of making more and more security changes.

USC has seen some troubling safety issues in the last year. With the killings of Ying Wu and Ming Qu in April and the shooting on Halloween, students, parents, alumni and staff all have reason for concern.
These events have prompted the university administration to increase campus security, but so far these changes have received a substantial amount of criticism. From inaccurate Trojans Alerts to plans to check IDs at every dorm entrance, the impact of these changes has largely been perceived as negative. Just because a crime hasn’t been stopped and students have been inconvenienced, however, doesn’t mean the new safety measures aren’t effective. They are the university’s best option to keep students safe and protect its own interests, and they must be enforced.
Whether students, faculty or staff like the new safety policies or not, they make sense. The university can’t force students to be safe; all they can do is try to keep campus as secure as possible, and for the most part the changes — Security Ambassadors, or yellow jackets, ID checks after 9 p.m. and additional security cameras, to name a few — should achieve that.
It’s not like the USC administration has a choice in enacting them. No matter how much students criticize the new safety measures, it’s nothing compared to the flak the administration would have received if it had done nothing. Parents, alumni and students all expected to see action from the university in response to the Halloween and April shootings. The university doesn’t want to inconvenience students, but ensuring their safety remains a top priority.
Some students have said that because the shootings were isolated incidents caused by people outside the university, there is no heightened safety risk for students. USC, however, is becoming more and more connected to the surrounding community — students can’t think of activity within that community as independent of university life any more. There are certain realities that come with living in a city as large as Los Angeles, and the frequency of incidents in the past year has made it clear that USC will continue to be affected by safety problems if changes aren’t made.
These changes, however, still need to be carefully considered and reviewed. USC must focus on providing appropriate, rather than invasive or overbearing, protection to its students and faculty. The impact of the policy that requires students to show IDs after 9 p.m., for example, remains to be seen as it will be implemented in the spring semester; if it ends up being too inconvenient, it should be reconsidered. But for now, the USC community needs to remember it has been affected by not one, but two shooting incidents in the last year. Until the university can determine more effective long-term solutions to safety problems in the community, it is better to err on the side of caution.
Solutions to such a serious problem will inevitably have drawbacks, and since it is difficult to measure improved security. the benefits aren’t always easy to see. Rather than flat-out rejecting new security measures, however, students, faculty and staff should give them a chance to improve security first.
Just because the new policies aren’t perfect does not mean they aren’t worth enforcing — and their enforcement is crucial to protecting the university community.

For sure the securest place on campus.
USC’s University Club (only faculty and staff can become members) has gotten a new home at King Stoops Hall, which started life in 1923 as a Los Angeles public library (and was a USC library for decades too). Perkins+Will designed the adaptive reuse project, adding an addition and creating “a main dining room that serves as the building’s showpiece, modern kitchen, private rooms, a lounge, bar, and second floor banquet area,” as well as a patio, according to a press release. Meanwhile, the old central library area has been opened up to focus on the cathedral ceiling and windows. The University Club used to be located in an old mid-century modern building at the south end of campus, but the press release notes that the new building is “at the heart of a campus that is expanding northward.”
I have gotten really good at cut and paste.  
For those that don’t know:
“How to Cut, Copy, and Paste in Windows
You can cut, copy, and paste in Windows to move items or copies of items to other locations within a file, or to a different file or application. Using the cut, copy, and paste features allows you to organize the items within your files quicker and easier, and Windows makes cutting, copying, and pasting easy by giving you a few simple steps to get the job done.
1  Select the text or object you want to work with.
Do so by clicking and dragging across the text that you want to work with or by clicking an object to select it.
2  Copy or Cut the item.
If you want to copy the item so that it remains in its current location, choose Edit→Copy, which makes a copy of the item to place elsewhere. Or you can choose Edit→Cut to remove the selected item from its present location and place it elsewhere.
3 Choose Edit→Paste.
Move your cursor to the location (in the current document, another document, or another application) where you want to place the item; choosing Edit→Paste places the item at that location.”
Most applications also offer toolbar buttons for Cut, Copy, and Paste, as well as keyboard shortcuts. The common keyboard shortcuts are: Cut, Ctrl+X; Copy, Ctrl+C; and Paste, Ctrl+V.
One slick feature of Microsoft applications is Paste Special. This displays a smart tag icon when you paste an item. If you click this icon, you get some choices about whether you retain formatting from the original item or assume the formatting of the location where you’re pasting it.”
 If only I could get that damn cell phone to work properly.
Beautiful.
Close the campus PLEASE!!!!!
“What if enough parents signed a petition pressuring Nikias to make USC a closed campus and he agreed? Such a change would be irreversibly detrimental to students and faculty, as well as to the valuable relationship the university has built with the surrounding community.”
Get it through your head sweetheart, once and for all. There is ZERO valuable relationship between the university and the community:
USC Contribution to Community:
1. Job Opportunities
2. Infrastructure Development
3. Local Investment
4. Community Service Programs (e.g. JEP)
Community Contribution to USC
1. Mugging Students (or stabbing them if they attempt to retain their possessions)
2. Molesting/Trying to Rape Students
3. Stealing Student Bicycles
4. Vandalizing and Loitering
5. Stealing Unattended Property and breaking into cars
6. Shooting at each other with students in the vicinity
There’s a clear definition for such a relationship, and you’ll find it in any high-school biology book. It’s called parasitism. Our so-called “community” are a bunch of disgraceful leeches who only detract from the amazing USC experience. Closing our campus will lose nothing, and gain everything.
The problem starts and ends with the Row!  Close that place down so I can get some sleep.  Noise keeps all my kitties up as well!
An obvious hack. previous post not me.
Spoof, not hack.
Identity theft
No, they hacked my computer.   I checked and that post came from my IP.  My system likely has become infected so I placed copper spools and tin foil over the computer box and extra foil under the key board for good measure.   Looks silly but I read on the internet it works to fix most similar hacking problems.
The D T has a problem, not me.

USC assistant coach Monte Kiffin will resign following the Trojans’ bowl game next month, the university announced through a statement Thursday night.
Kiffin intends to “pursue opportunities” in the NFL, where he had previously spent 26 years as an assistant, including 12 seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as defensive coordinator, according to the statement.
“I wanted to make this announcement now so that our players who are preparing for the bowl game and our recruits who will be visiting campus are aware,” Kiffin said. “I really enjoyed my time at USC and the opportunity I had to work with our players and coaches. The chance to work for my son, Lane, was unique and memorable, but we always treated each other professionally on a coach-to-coach basis.”
The architect of the famed “Tampa 2” defense, Kiffin had served as the de facto defensive coordinator for the Trojans since arriving as an assistant in January 2010 along with Lane, the team’s third-year head coach.
“I respect my father’s decision and his desire to return to the NFL,” Lane Kiffin said. “We are very appreciative of the hard work and effort that he put in at USC these past three years. He has a tremendous passion for coaching young men and he is a phenomenal recruiter.”
In 2012, USC ranked 63rd nationally in total defense, surrendering 396.1 yards per game. It gave up an average of 500 yards in each of its five losses — including a record number for points (62), touchdowns (nine) and yards (730) against Oregon on Nov. 3 at the Coliseum. The week prior, versus Arizona, the Trojans gave up 39 points to the Wildcats on 588 yards.
The team’s five losses overall also mark the most for a preseason Associated Press No. 1 team since 1964, when Ole Miss finished 5-5-1.
“Although things didn’t always go as well as we would have liked this year from a defensive and win-loss standpoint, I will leave USC with the utmost respect for the University, the Trojan Family and, most importantly, the players I had the good fortune to coach,” Monte Kiffin said. “I see great things ahead for the USC football program.”
According to the statement, USC plans to find a replacement for the 72-year-old coach.
Added Lane Kiffin: “The timing of this allows us to move forward now in the hiring of a new coach.”
To what capacity a replacement would serve remains unclear.
Just saw this after reading the column by Will Laws, apparently Pat Haden gave Lane a break, but said ” you gotta go Monte, you’re done”. thank you Jesus.

The shoppers are at it again. This year’s Black Friday weekend surpassed last year’s record-breaking retail revenue of $52.4 billion, with Reuters recording $1 billion in online sales the first day alone. According to the Los Angeles Times, 247 million shoppers spent a total of $59.1 billion just this weekend—yet another record.
As great as these statistics look for the business world, people are missing a glaring eyesore in the bigger picture. The implications of a society increasingly obsessed with materialism outweigh the advantages of humongous sales figures, including the economic benefits.
As Black Friday continues to break records year after year, the irony of the sales event has never been thicker. As soon as Thanksgiving is over, Americans across the nation abandon the blessings they’ve counted for more, more, more?
Indeed, according to the Times, holiday spending accounts for about 40 percent of annual retail sales. Black Friday enthusiasts call this “economic patriotism,” but the statistics also represent hype for spending just for the sake of spending, which is an unhealthy practice no matter how you look at it.
The willingness of Americans to spend on this particular weekend reveals an insatiable materialistic drive so powerful that the true holiday spirit—of giving and being thankful for what we have—gets lost under the gift wrap.
From a fiscal standpoint, excessive consumerism encourages people to spend money they don’t have—part of the reason we got into the recent economic crisis in the first place. Black Friday also encourages waste. This time of year, businesses are particularly savvy at luring the consumer into buying products they don’t need and won’t use for the thrill of securing a good deal.
The madness isn’t over yet. After days of stuffing themselves with turkey and pie, an estimated 129.2 million shoppers will continue to venture online for fresh discounts this week, according to the Times. The lure may be great, but if holiday goodness isn’t enough to dissuade you, think of next year and the looming fiscal cliff that will still be here.

Sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee and freshman defensive end Leonard Williams received recognition from the Pac-12 yesterday, with Lee winning Offensive Player of the Year in the conference and Williams taking home the Freshman Defensive Player of the Year award.
The awards, in conjunction with All-Conference First Team recognition given to Lee and senior center Khaled Holmes, are the highlights of a 7-5 season which began with BCS Championship aspirations. All-Conference Second Team recipients include junior wide receiver Robert Woods, junior defensive end Morgan Breslin, senior safety T.J. McDonald and junior cornerback Nickell Robey. Lee also was recognized on the second team as a return specialist.
Honorable mentions were given to 13 Trojans, most notably quarterback Matt Barkley, who entered the season as a Heisman frontrunner. Others include sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey, junior running back Silas Redd and sophomore defensive lineman George Uko.
Lee was given the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year award in lieu of his record-setting season, establishing new Pac-12 marks in receptions and receiving yards. He hauled in 112 passes for 1,680 yards, averaging 140 yards a game. He is also a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award, given to the top wide receiver in the country. He ranked third in the FBS in 215.67 all-purpose yards this season as well, racking up an additional 85 yards a game in special teams returns and rushing.

After the release of personal emails led to national outrage over CIA chief David Petraeus’ extramarital affair, a deluge of doubt has arisen over the security of email, as well as chats, tweets, likes, posts, video calls, and other forms of internet communication.
Secrets are no longer secrets when today’s technology is involved, necessitating a heightened sense of caution—for the CIA agent or the average college student.
As Petraeus learned, Gmail accounts are vulnerable to government hackers. However, the government can also request private data from email companies. Law enforcement can easily gain access to stored emails as well as trace the user’s IP address.
We are not only vulnerable through email, however. Internet shoppers are in danger of online identity theft, while something as simple as filling out a college application requires providing cyberspace with confidential information like a date of birth or social security number.
Efforts to maintain control are being made. In Europe, strict rules for Facebook have been proposed. According to Tech Crunch, the proposals are aimed at “harmonizing data protection rules across the EU” and giving citizens more control over their personal data, including through “granting people the right to have data… deleted on request… and data ported to another service.”
To safeguard electronic communications such as emails, The New York Times recommends measures from only using personal devices for sensitive communications to “10 Minute Mail”—temporary, self-destructing email accounts.
The only surefire way for Internet users to protect themselves, however, is to place less trust in technology and take more personal responsibility in safeguarding their personal lives online. We have to remember not to treat the cyber world as we would the pages of a diary.
As this year’s scandal, like the Wikileaks drama of two years ago, reminds us, private and public spheres of life overlap more often than not, due largely to how much we channel our private lives through social media, emails and the cyber world. The risk of private information becoming public knowledge may be only a click away.
