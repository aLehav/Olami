The No. 1 USC men’s water polo team has a long-term goal: to win a fourth consecutive NCAA championship title this season.
It took its first step toward that goal Sunday, defeating Fresno Pacific 26-4 as part of the UC Irvine Invitational in Irvine, Calif.
The Trojans (1-0) faced the Sunbirds in their first regular season matchup of the season — one day removed from scrimmages against Long Beach State, Stanford and UC Irvine.
They capped with the weekend with a second scrimmage against the Anteaters on Sunday, as well.
“The biggest improvement we made from the first to second day was passing,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “The first game we played against Irvine was 9-7 but the second time we played it was 11-1. It was a huge difference between playing the same team on the first day and second. Our guys were much more unselfish in our second game [in terms of passing].”
The defending champions began their lone regular season contest of the weekend against Fresno Pacific with seven consecutive goals, followed by one goal from the Sunbirds. The Trojans responded by scoring 10 more, bringing the score at the half a commanding 17-1. In the second two frames, things went from bad to worse for USC’s competition as the Trojans sealed the 26-4 victory.
Three Trojans scored four goals each during the match; redshirt freshman driver Zach Lucas, sophomore driver Stephen Siri and senior driver Peter Kurzeka.
Vavic, in his 17th season of coaching the men’s team, was quick to credit his players.
“We had three guys who scored four goals … but overall we give the guys the points for goals, assists and defensive efforts,” Vavic said. “Overall the player with the most points was [redshirt junior Andrew] Reego, he had 21 points, and the second was Peter [Kurzeka] with 19. Those would be our top players of the game.”
Despite the team’s impressive victory, Vavic refrained from forming conclusions about his young group.
“After that game it’s hard to really judge anything about how the rest of the season is going to be,” Vavic said. “It was a good opportunity to play everybody. We played 20 players, 2 goalies and 18 regular players, and we feel very confident.”
Following its strong player over opening weekend, the team will head into next weekend’s match against Cal Baptist looking to build upon its debut performance.
“The guys had some really good showings and I think our offense was really prepared in every game,” Vavic said. “Defensively we were much better our second day than the first day. Overall I was very pleased with our energy and excitement.”

The Struggle for 53 — What Trojans made the NFL cut, who missed out
It’s that time of year. The NFL is almost here. This past weekend featured the fourth and final preseason games for teams, and final cuts were made to trim all rosters to 53. Here are the former Trojans unable to make it on the active roster for one of the 32 teams:
Of those that were cut, only Kristofer O’Dowd caught most off guard. O’Dowd was considered a top-five center in the last draft, but went undrafted. Arizona signed him to address depth issues on the offensive line, but the two eventually parted ways.
The surprise of the weekend was not a cut, but a signing. Wide receiver Keary Colbert, who last played in the NFL in 2009, made the 53-man roster for the Kansas City Chiefs. Since he played for the Detroit Lions in 2009, Colbert played for the UFL’s Florida Tuskers and Sacramento Mountain Lions, and was even the assistant tight ends coach for USC last season.
Old faces, new places
The significant former Trojan switching teams was running back Reggie Bush. After an up and down career in New Orleans, Bush has been given a fresh start with the Miami Dolphins.
Although he has yet to show the top-notch playmaking ability he had at USC, Bush is hoping a change of scenery does the trick. Dolphins head coach Tony Sparano has already given Bush the vote of confidence, as declaring Bush will receive significantly more carries to start with than rookie Daniel Thomas due to Thomas’ slow progress.
Safety Taylor Mays was also on the move, as the San Francisco 49ers traded him to the Cincinnati Bengals for a seventh round draft pick. Mays, the former All-American, only completed one season in the league for the ‘Niners before new San Francisco head coach Jim Harbaugh shipped him east. Mays should be fighting with the incumbent Chris Crocker to win a starting safety role, but for now, it looks like Mays will be a special teamer and backup.
