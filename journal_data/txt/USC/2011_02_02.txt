“Black mamba” bites USC, chooses Oregon
Rumors swirled last weekend about a secret visit longtime Trojan commit De’Anthony Thomas took to the University of Oregon.
Then pictures appeared online with Thomas in Oregon gear from head to toe, putting even more fuel on the fire.
Thomas, who according to Rivals.com is the No. 1 athlete in the 2011 class and No. 5 overall in the nation, committed to USC last May and insisted that he would be a Trojan.
Despite reports throughout the day that Thomas of Crenshaw High (Los Angeles, Calif.) was leaning toward Oregon, Trojan fans held their breath in hopes of retaining their coveted recruit.
Thomas made his decision around 7 p.m. in the gym of his high school, saying that he had chosen to go to Oregon.
Thomas, known locally as “the Black Mamba,” was voted the Los Angeles City Section Player of the Year and helped lead Crenshaw to their second straight City Section title.

Walker signs with Trojans, not hometown Buckeyes
USC beat Ohio State, again.
This time, however, the win came in February.
The Trojans made a big move on signing day as they swiped offensive lineman Aundrey Walker from the Buckeyes.
Walker announced his decision at his high school Glenville High in Cleveland, Ohio.
This is a big pickup for the Trojans as offensive line was arguably their biggest need.
Walker, who comes in at 6-foot-6 and 355 pounds, is rated the No. 1 guard by Rivals, No. 9 by Scout and No. 15 by ESPN.
Walker could start right away, as USC needs to replace three linemen, including junior right tackle Tyron Smith, who left early for the NFL Draft and expected to go in the first round.
Walker told Scout.com that immediate playing time and his relationship with recruiting coordinator Ed Orgeron impacted his decision.
“USC has a great coaching staff and it’s a nice place,” Walker said. “The school is great itself. I’m surrounded by a group of good people.”
It also didn’t hurt that his recruiting visit coincided with his 18th birthday.
“We had a great time. L.A. is great, man,” Walker said. “The coaches showed me a lot of love.”

USC reels in coveted Kentucky recruit
This morning linebacker Lamar Dawson of Boyle County High, who was silent about his plans in the weeks leading up to today, announced that he will don the cardinal and gold next fall.
Dawson, rated as a Rivals.com four-star recruit, has the size and speed to excel at both inside and outside linebacker.
Dawson had considered offers from upwards of 10 universities, including Oregon and Tennessee, but presumably viewed the Trojans’ depleted linebacker corps as an opportunity to play early.
“USC was my best visit, and I got along well with the players and especially the coaches. I got to know coach [Joe] Barry real well, and then he came out and met my mom on the visit,” Dawson said after announcing his decision live on the Louisville Courier-Journal’s website.

Senior guard Donte Smith thought he had an open fast break layup and an opportunity to close UCLA’s eight-point lead.
Instead, Smith found himself stumbling to the ground with a little more than four minutes to go.
Streak snapped · Junior guard Jio Fontan and the Trojans had their four-game win streak against their crosstown rivals snapped. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The Bruins’ Lazeric Jones had chased him down and cleanly rejected the shot, stuffing the ball back into Smith’s hands.
That’s the type of night it was for USC and its guards as they fell 64-50 to crosstown rival UCLA (15-7, 7-3).
Despite 32 combined points from junior forward Nikola Vucevic and senior center Alex Stepheson, the Bruins controlled the game throughout.
Vucevic and Stepheson got no help from the guards, who made only four jump shots in the game.
The Trojans’ (12-11, 4-6)  starting guards managed only seven points and USC didn’t have a single perimeter point in the final 25 minutes of play.
Just like the first crosstown showdown this season, UCLA entered on a hot streak having won five of six.
Unlike last month’s game, the Bruins guaranteed themselves a victory by jumping out to an early lead with a 12-4 run after Stepheson scored the first two points of the game.
UCLA would not trail again.
USC showed some life ending the first half on a 9-2 run, punctuated by a Maurice Jones drive and dish to Vucevic for an emphatic slam just before the first-half buzzer expired.
The run trimmed the lead down to a one-point halftime lead after the Bruins had led by as much as nine.
Joshua Smith came off the bench to lead UCLA with 15 points on 5-of-9 shooting. He also collected six rebounds.
As a team, the Bruins shot 48 percent while in the second half USC made only seven field goals, shooting 30 percent from the floor.
The Trojans have a week to lick their wounds before hosting the Oregon schools.
They will play Oregon State at the Galen Center next Thursday.

The NCAA is expected to cite the University of Tennessee football program as well as current USC coach Lane Kiffin for a failure to monitor, according to a report published by Clay Travis of AOL’s FanHouse.com Wednesday.
The charges stem from improper contact Kiffin and other coaches might have had with recruits during the coach’s one-year stint with the Volunteers in 2009, resulting in a 7-6 mark overall.
“I have no comment on that,” Kiffin told reporters. “Nor do I know anything about that.”
Although since disbanded, according to Travis, Tennessee’s Orange Pride program, which allegedly made impermissible contact with recruits as outlined by The New York Times in December of 2009, is currently at the center of the NCAA’s investigation.
The allegations, initially reported by the Times, state that Vols hostesses had traveled to a high school football game in South Carolina to watch three Tennessee recruits play. One of those three players, defensive end Corey Miller, eventually signed with the school, while the two others signed with North Carolina and South Carolina.
Kiffin’s brother-in-law David Reaves, an assistant quarterback coach for Tennessee at the time and presently an assistant at the University of New Mexico, is also expected to be named in the report.
As reported by Travis, Reaves made improper contact with recruits personally in addition to instructing hostesses about which highly-ranked recruits to contact and how to contact them.
Hostesses were encouraged to contact certain prospects and inquire how official visits to other schools went before encouraging them to sign with Tennessee. Following such conversations, Reaves asked members of Orange Pride to relay updates to him and the coaching staff.
If Kiffin, Reaves and Tennessee do in fact receive official letters of allegations from the NCAA, they will have 90 days to respond to the findings.
Kiffin has yet to be reprimanded by the NCAA for any major infractions, but reportedly was cited for six secondary violations, all while serving as coach of the Volunteers.
This is such bs. The NCAA really has it out for USC. After their first set of sanctions failed, now they’re going after our coach? Isn’t this a Tennessee problem? In which case go sanction Tennessee. 
Put down the haterade Paul Dee, it’s over.

It was supposed to be a down year for USC football.
After the program dominated the college football world for quite some time, the NCAA finally brought the Trojans down to earth.
Former USC running back Reggie Bush was found to have received improper benefits.
So, the NCAA decided to ram it down USC’s throat — much like Bush did to his opponents during his three-year career wearing the cardinal and gold.
The NCAA gave us a pretty good beating, too, taking away a total of 30 scholarships over the 2011, 2012 and 2013 seasons and imposing a two-year bowl ban.
Aside from the brutal punishment, a subpar 8-5 season by USC standards topped it all off.
Not all was lost, however — we still managed to defeat crosstown rival UCLA and that definitely counts for something far larger than just one victory.
Now you can tally up a couple more victories — or even more — in the recruiting process.
And with National Signing Day over, it seems as if nothing has really changed around this town. 
USC still owns UCLA in football, on and off the field.
On the field, that’s old news.
But off the field, it could have been a different story, at least according to UCLA coach Rick Neuheisel.
In an ad created by the UCLA marketing department in August 2008, Neuheisel is pictured pointing with the caption, “The football monopoly in Los Angeles is finally over.”
Mind you, the word “over” was boldly printed to make a statement.
But that’s not the idea I’m getting at.
Along with the eight spring enrollees, USC coach Lane Kiffin and his staff have taken full advantage of using every scholarship to land top-notch talent, pulling in a total of 30 commits.
At the start of the day, USC was the fifth-best nationally ranked recruiting class and now it stands as the fourth-best in the nation, according to Rivals.com.
Though USC did lose four-star offensive lineman Troy Niklas to Notre Dame and three-star linebacker Kent Turene to Georgia, it still managed to pry big names prospects away from attending their hometown schools.
Four-star offensive guard, and the nation’s No. 64 overall according to Rivals.com, prospect Aundrey Walker spurned his native Ohio State University to come to the Trojans and four-star defensive tackle Christian Heyward, the nation’s No. 94 overall prospect, turned down an opportunity to play for San Diego State.
On the other hand, Trojans lost out on the nation’s No. 5 overall prospect in De’Anthony Thomas after he decided to rescind his verbal commitment and head to Oregon.
Had Anthony kept his commitment, USC would have finished the day with the No. 1 recruiting class in the nation.
But that’s fine with me — there’s only room for one “Black Mamba” in Los Angeles anyway.
USC also managed to get another Rivals100 prospect in linebacker Lamar Dawson, who was expected to go to either Kentucky or Tennessee.
Some notable prospects from out of state include linebacker Anthony Sarao (No. 8 overall at his position) and offensive lineman Cyrus Hobbi (No. 4 overall at his position).
Not only that, but USC coach Lane Kiffin capitalized on homegrown talent, nabbing Mater Dei High standout wide receiver Victor Blackwell and Kings Academy four-star running back Amir Carlisle, who had originally been leaning toward Stanford.
Kiffin also went back to Gardena Serra High, home to current Trojans wide receiver Robert Woods, to nab four-star recruit Marqise Lee and another Serra standout in wide receiver George Farmer, who is one of the nation’s most coveted players.
Other notable prospects from California include four-star defensive end Greg Townsend Jr. and four-star linebacker Tre Madden.
To cap off Kiffin’s second National Signing Day for Kiffin, Junior Pomee and Ryan Henderson of Rancho Verde High both signed with the Trojans.
Four-star prospect Pomee was reported to be the best overall prospects at the Florida Friday Night Lights Camp last summer, while Henderson posted prolific numbers at combine workouts.
While the Trojans have been making headlines, the Bruins are barely on the radar at all.
The Bruins have only managed to bring in 16 commits, and only one of them ranks in the Rivals100.
Conversely, the Trojans have 10 official commits in the Rivals100.
If you ask me, that seems like a down year for the Bruins.
But then again, that’s not a surprise if you’ve been following UCLA for some time now.
Sanctions or no sanctions, nobody has been able to stop USC.
The NCAA’s punishment might have been a small roadblock in the path to success, but it certainly hasn’t affected the recruiting process.
And with the sanctions not set to kick in until after a decision is made on the appeals, USC will continue to do what it has always been doing in Los Angeles with the football program.
Like Matt Barkley infamously said after a win against UCLA: “We run this town tonight.”
Indeed, it is true — Los Angeles is still a Trojan town.

In his first full year of recruiting, USC coach Lane Kiffin continued the tradition of reeling in top-notch talent in spite of rather steep challenges, as USC announced Wednesday the signing of twenty-two players for its 2011 recruiting class.
A new beginning · Despite NCAA sanctions, USC coach Lane Kiffin and his staff managed to bring in top talent from around the country. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
“It’s not me,” Kiffin said at a press conference introducing his newest class. “I don’t care how good of a recruiter you are if you aren’t at a place like USC. USC is the only place with all that going on and all the ammo that everyone else had against [us] where you can get it done. It just speaks volumes about USC.”
The class, ranked No. 4 overall by Yahoo! Sports’ Rivals.com, consists of five defensive lineman, four offensive lineman, four linebackers, three wide receivers, two running backs, two defensive backs, one tight end and one punter in addition to the eight spring enrollees — a total of 30 prospects.
“This class is very deep,” Kiffin said. “It address a lot of needs. We wanted to add a number of quality players and I know we didn’t reach. We could have added some other guys, but we wanted to make sure we got the right guys.”
Even while sanctioned, the Trojans had some flexibility in the number of players it could sign as a result of its pending appeal, which was heard Jan. 22 by the NCAA Infractions Appeals Committee.
Since USC signed a full class, however, the scholarship restrictions placed on the program last June, which included a loss of 30 scholarships over the course of three seasons, will not take effect until 2012, lasting through 2014.
But if the university’s appeal is successful, the scholarships reductions beginning next February will result in a loss of just five scholarships per recruiting class.
Yet, because several areas of the depth chart have become increasingly thin as a result of smaller recruiting classes toward the end of Pete Carroll’s tenure, Kiffin and his staff made the effort to fill the roster out.
Another focus for USC was to build a wall around Southern California, keeping control over the wealth of talent in the region.
“As of right now, I think we did a pretty good job,” Kiffin said. “Unfortunately we can’t get everybody every time. I think our staff did pretty well. Obviously that was a big concern of ours to make sure that happened.”
Athlete Marqise Lee (Gardena, Calif.), a four-star prospect, turned down Miami (Fl.) and followed in the footsteps of five-star wide receiver and high school teammate George Farmer (Gardena, Calif.).
Of all of the recruits, Kiffin suggested that Farmer was most likely to make an immediate impact, much like Robert Woods a season ago. As a freshman, Woods caught 65 passes for 792 yards and six touchdowns, while starting alongside Ronald Johnson.
But with Johnson set to graduate, the Trojans will need a replacement opposite Woods.
Increasingly important for Kiffin and his staff, however, was bringing in more bodies along the offensive and defensive lines, and essentially, the staff seemed pleased they were able to do as much.
Four-star defensive tackle Christian Heyward (San Diego.) turned down Oregon and San Diego State in favor of USC. Heyward cited the NFL-caliber coaching staff at USC as the deciding factor, and many pundits suggest the ninth-ranked prospect is better than the rankings suggest.
Much like in 2010, Kiffin did an admirable job of recruiting nationally, nabbing the services of several highly-touted recruits who were undecided heading into National Signing Day.
Top-rated offensive guard Aundrey Walker (Cleveland, Ohio) spurned hometown favorite Ohio State to sign with USC.
“Here’s a player at Cleveland Glenville High School,” Kiffin said. “When you study it, and they’re out from the state of Ohio, they usually go to Ohio State.  Aundrey’s 375 pounds, 6-foot-5, so he gives us some size there and we’ll see. We’ll plug [Walker] in and see what he can do.”
Four-star linebacker Lamar Dawson (Danville, Kentucky) took a similar route, as well.
“Local kids, California kids, you like to think you are going to get them,” Kiffin said. “To go into SEC country and get Lamar was a pleasant surprised.”
While the Trojans won their fair share of recruiting battles Wednesday, they also found themselves on the losing end of some others.
Offensive lineman Troy Niklas (Anaheim, Calif.) signed with rival Notre Dame, while cornerback Marcus Roberson (Ft. Lauderdale, FL) signed with Florida after decomitting from Auburn on Monday.
Most notably, long-time commit De’Anthony Thomas (Los Angeles) of Crenshaw High reneged on his verbal pledge to USC, signing with Oregon.
Thomas is the No. 1 ranked athlete in the country and the fifth-best prospect in the country, according to Rivals.com.
But in spite of losing out on a few potential recruits, Kiffin remained optimistic about the future of the program.
“At the UCLA game afterwards, I said this was going to be a very critical off season for us, and one that we were going to spend every day working on this class so hopefully we didn’t have a season like we did before,” Kiffin said. “I think today we’ve made a step toward that.”

Jim Tucker, a 1975 graduate of USC’s School of Architecture in 1975, was one of 13 people injured in the Arizona shooting last month. He spent one week in the University Medical Center, just north of the main campus of the University of Arizona.
Bullet fragments ricocheted into his collarbone, cracking the C2 vertebrae in his neck and other small bullet fragments lodged between his shoulder blades. Another bullet entered the inside of his calf and exited below his knee. He described the experience in a phone interview with the Daily Trojan.
Daily Trojan: Why were you attending Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords’ ‘Congress on Your Corner’ event?
Jim Tucker: I wanted to meet Giffords, I hadn’t met her before and I wanted to thank her for her work. Just earlier that week she had authored a bill for representatives to take five percent pay cuts. That’s admirable to me because that’s leadership by example to be able to do that. It wasn’t very popular with some of her colleagues, but it was a gutsy move. Plus, I just wanted to meet her, she’s my representative and I was just exercising my right as a citizen.
DT: What were you doing right before you were injured?
Tucker: Giffords was talking to my wife and standing between us. I was waiting my turn and being like a good husband, not interrupting their conversation. I was just waiting until she turned to talk to me. I was looking down at the ground and all of a sudden I heard the gun shot, and by the second shot I was lying on the concrete slab. I certainly felt the bullet that hit my right collarbone, but not the one that hit my right leg. When I was lying there I couldn’t even move, I was stunned, but when I looked at my wife and saw she wasn’t hurt, I laid my head back and said: Thank you, Lord. This could’ve been a whole lot worse. Things could have obviously been worse for me as well. I could be paralyzed or dead so I just feel like truly a blessed man.
DT: How is your wife handling everything?
Tucker: The tears come totally unexpected when we get something in the mail or somebody comes to the door. Some Girl Scouts went door-to-door selling and giving the proceeds to the family of Christina-Taylor Green, the 9-year-old who died in the shooting. A neighbor told them I had also been shot and so they came to our house and said, ‘We know your husband was injured and we just wanted to give you a box of each of the Girl Scout cookies we sell.’ As soon as my wife closed the door, the tears came. So the emotions are close to the surface right now. I try to do as many things for myself as possible so I don’t become a burden on her.
DT: How is your recovery going?
Tucker: It’s going well. I’m doing some physical therapy and that’s helping. In one sense it makes things hurt, but you just do it because otherwise things aren’t going to heal as quickly if you don’t. So I just suck it up and do it. Like this week, I can bend my right elbow. I can’t swing it out away from my body because that involves muscles higher up in the arm and those are still waking up. It’s gone from a more generalized pain to a more localized pain that’s a little bit more intense. I’m finding that my shoulder blade is sore because that’s what took the brunt of my pain in the fall to the concrete. It does mean the nerves are starting to work again, though. I have a doctor’s appointment on the 14th to get my stitches removed, and the 17th I will get the bullet fragments removed.
DT: What are your recovery goals?
Tucker: In a nutshell, a 100 percent recovery. I’d like to return to work in about four weeks. My arm doesn’t have to be 100 percent back to normal, but if I get what I feel is a substantial use of my arm and movement, I think the doctors will probably release me to go back to work. It’s a mental and emotional recovery — I have to take it day by day. There are some days where you’re laying in bed and want sympathy but those are coming farther and fewer in between. There are some days where you wake up and want to maintain a normal routine.
DT: How has the Tucson community responded to your accident?
Tucker: It’s been unbelievable. I’m getting cards and letters from people I don’t even know. Just the thoughtfulness particularly here in Tucson and with our church. Even e-mails from people around the country and around the world. To sum it up in one word, overwhelming doesn’t even begin to cut it, but it’s the closest thing I can say to describe it. When there’s a problem like this, regardless of political beliefs, everybody comes together.
DT: Has this event changed your outlook on life?
Tucker: It’s more solidified how I look at life. I’m a Christian, and I don’t believe that things happen by accident, there’s a purpose for it. I don’t necessarily have to understand the why at the moment, but my faith has been a real anchor for over 50 years for me.
DT: What are your feelings toward the shooter?
Tucker: Not harsh feelings, I think more than anything I feel very sad for the way that he chose to act and I feel very sad for his family who have to live with the stigma for what their son has done. As far as the shooter himself, I don’t believe that anyone is beyond the reach of a gracious and loving God. Granted he’s going to have to pay for the consequences of his actions, but I still think there can be forgiveness from God if he so seeks it. The only time I feel frustration is when I’m doing something like buttoning a button on my shirt that used to be second nature, but now isn’t. I’d be less than honest to say there aren’t moments when there isn’t a little bit of anger, but it’s more frustration.
DT: What does USC mean to you?
Tucker: I think it was a time to really crystallize how I looked at things and particularly with architecture, it really helped me to sharpen my synthesizing skills. Although I was a commuter student and couldn’t stay in the dorms or the Greek Row, I think USC is there to educate the whole person. I learned that it’s not just to get an education and have a productive career, but also that giving is a part of life as well. I have a lot of fond memories from being a student there.
Jim, you give new meaning to the term, “Fight On.”  Best wishes for a speedy recovery.

The USC Good Neighbors Campaign reached its highest goal yet by raising $80,000 more than its original aim of $1.3 million for 2010.
The Good Neighbors Campaign solicits donations from USC faculty and staff to raise funds for both the USC Neighborhood Outreach and United Way organizations.
Funding is distributed in the form of university and community partnership grants to charities and programs around the surrounding area of USC. These programs range in focus from promoting education to assisting people in finding employment and housing.
“We are just ecstatic at the generosity of the faculty and staff and their dedication to the Good Neighbors Campaign,” said Carolina Castillo, executive director of planning and development at the USC Office of Government and Civic Engagement.
Castillo added that the increase in donations demonstrates USC’s continued commitment to being a partner in the local community.
“This strengthens both the university and the community. It truly is a win-win situation,” Castillo said.
In 2009, the USC Good Neighbors Campaign raised $1.2 million. This was aided in part by the USC Hospitals, which matched the entire amount raised by their employees for the campaign.
Jonathan Spees, chief financial officer for USC Hospitals, said that they were encouraged to contribute to the campaign because they viewed it as an effective way of giving back to the community.
“We thought this was a terrific program with lots of benefits,” Spees said. “We wanted to honor our obligation of giving back to the area around USC, and we thought, ‘What better way of doing this than by making a donation?’”
Spees added that although it is unlikely these large donations will continue in the future, USC Hospitals still wants to support local programs and organizations that aid local community members.
“We want to focus on giving back more diplomatically than just through cash donations. However, we haven’t had a chance to fully develop our community benefit programs yet, so that is something that we are definitely working on,” Spees said.
The Joint Educational Project (JEP) has benefitted from grants from the Good Neighbors Campaign in the past, incorporating several thousands of USC student-volunteers.
“In the past, we have usually received between $40-45,000 from the Good Neighbors Campaign. Most of the money goes to student salaries for coordinators who help to oversee the program,” said Christina Koneazny, associate director of administration of JEP.
Tammy Anderson, director of JEP, said the organization writes an annual proposal for a grant from the Good Neighbors Campaign to help offset administrative and training costs.
“For the many past years now, we have benefitted through the funds we receive to help us pay for our coordinators, specifically within our USC ReadersPlus program,” Anderson said.
Chelsea Snyder, one of the student coordinators at JEP who receive their salaries from the Good Neighbors Campaign, said that raising this kind of money creates an enormous impact.
“It’s very exciting to know that they not only achieved their goal but exceeded it as well,” Snyder said. “It’s so important that people from USC, and especially students, are willing to help their community and make a difference.”
Lena Cronin, a sophomore majoring in communication, said she saw the Good Neighbors Campaign as a way to merge USC and the surrounding area.
“It shows that students here aren’t just in a bubble, and that we’re socially aware of what is going on around us,” Cronin said.
The Good Neighbors Campaign typically increases its annual goal by $100,000 each year, although a goal for next year has not yet been set.
Castillo said USC Neighborhood Outreach has three specific funding priorities that will be considered for funding grants this coming year.
“We want to focus on improving educational outcomes, particularly in K-12 students, improving health outcomes, particularly in the area of obesity and diabetes and supporting job training and small business development,” she said. “Ultimately, we just want to make a greater impact on our community.”
This is creative fundraising at its finest. People don’t often give students the credit they deserve. They are not just their for their degrees.

USC Libraries has begun actively working to improve the overall library experience for people in the USC community as part of the Essential Library, a new initiative.
Studying · Ashish Ingle, a graduate student studying business administration, studies in the Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Library. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan 
Catherine Quinlan, the dean of USC Libraries, said the strategic plan aims to provide comprehensive access tools, establish partnerships with outside organizations and create an intellectually stimulating environment that fosters productive research.
Currently, the libraries are focusing on making all information easily accessible for students, while increasing student knowledge about research itself, according to Quinlan.
“Students and faculty come here not just to find materials, but to find help. Today we have more places to find information, but it doesn’t always lead to good information,” Quinlan said. “So our job is to help everyone become a critical consumer.”
Hugh McHarg, executive director of Communications and Public Programming of USC Libraries, said USC Libraries want to create a mobile website that would allow for access to library resources through phones and tablets to make basic research easier for students on the go.
For the future, Quinlan has her eyes set on refurbishing Leavey Library and possibly optimizing it with more accommodations and computers for students and some students are excited by that possibility.
“Leavey just seems so cold and harsh, so if they could fix that I would definitely be more inclined to study there,” Julianne Coronado, a senior majoring in social sciences (economics) said.
Quinlan said USC Libraries needs to revisit how the space is being used in Leavey Library because the desks were originally meant to hold bulky computers instead of the smaller, slimmer ones used today.
The first plan to improve the libraries began when Quinlan accepted her position in the fall of 2007. She said the libraries were not organized as well as they should have been, causing a decrease in usage by students.
“I remember looking for a book in the philosophy library and it wasn’t there. As it turned out, that book hadn’t been there for ten years — it was over in Doheny,” Quinlan said. “Well, if that’s the service we’re giving people, no wonder they’re not using our collections because they can’t find what they’re looking for.”
Quinlan said her staff worked to reorganize Doheny Library this fall by putting more than one million books on the nine floors in the proper sequence.
“We’re on an ascending level of quality, but there’s always going to be more and more to do,” Quinlan said.
Quinlan said she hopes the changes will draw more students to USC libraries in the near future.
“I’m hoping that we’re bursting at the seams, because we have so many people that want to get engaged with the libraries and want to showcase our selections,” Quinlan said. “I want people coming to us all the time because they see us as an important part of their research.”

USC has no plans to give students a direct way to identify as a lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, despite a national push to add such options to applications.
Students think it’s important for universities to include this on applications because this information will provide a clearer picture of what a university’s demographics are.
Emily Allen, director of the USC Queer and Ally Student Assembly, said she believes students should be able to identify themselves as LGBT on applications.
“If students are able to put their ethnicity and nationality on applications, then it seems right that they should also be able to put their sexual identity,” Allen said. “It is something that identifies them and it makes them stand out from other students.”
The Board of the Common Application decided last week not to allow LGBT students the option to identify themselves as such, disappointing many.
“LGBT youth deserve to know that the institution of their choice will be inclusive and welcoming,” said a statement from Campus Pride, a nonprofit organization for students working to create more LGBT-accepting universities.
Some feel that not allowing students to identify their sexuality on college applications prevents administrators from fully understanding what kind of students are attending their universities.
“It makes it harder for colleges to reach out to everyone and meet the needs of LGBT students,” said Serena Au, the resident adviser of the Rainbow Floor in Century Apartments.
Adding the option for self-identification could increase the diversity of programs offered by colleges and universities, Au said.
“For the Rainbow Floor in particular, it’s hard to reach out to freshmen students if we don’t know who to reach out to,” Au said. “Right now we have to wait for people to find out about us, but we could be actively recruiting and reaching out to students.”
Some pointed out, however, that not all students fully understand their sexuality by freshman year.
“It wouldn’t help us get a concrete student number because developmentally some discover their sexuality earlier or later on in life; it depends on the individual,” said Vincent Vigil, director of the USC LGBT Resource Center.
Even though USC students do not have the option of indicating their sexualities on the application, many LGBT students are happy with USC’s commitment to diversity.
“Though there is no box to check if you are gay, USC is open to diversity in its student body and would never advise students to hide something about themselves in their essays,” said Joshua DeMilta, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism and political science.
DeMilta wrote about his coming out experience in some of his college application essays.
“I talked about my coming out experience … because it shaped who I am and how I dealt with challenges in my past,” DeMilta said. “I believe that the Common Application decided to [not ask about sexuality] so that students would not face discrimination in the admission process, but they went the completely wrong way in how to do so.”
To Anonymous:
Very well said–My thoughts exactly.
I believe that rightfully so, students should not be forced to declare their sexual orientation on a college application. Personally, as an active member of the LGBT community here at USC, I was somewhat relieved to not have to deal with the additional stress of having to answer such a personal question during an already stressful college application season. 
I was not out to my parents through high school, and I feel that many others are in a similar situation. My parents insisted on looking over the application – naturally, that would have been the only part of the application that I would have lied about, in order to protect both them and me. Adding such a question in regards to sexual orientation – forcing 17, 18-year-olds to answer such a convoluted question with as little life experience that an enclosed high school environment provides – is simply a burden that I would not place upon current high school students. Like Mr. Vigil said, it would not bring reliable information to the school. 
Naturally, it would be highly illegal for universities to discriminate and accept/decline applications based on information such as gender, ethnicity, nationality, and sexual orientation. Yet somehow, over and over again, we could almost say that we see affirmative action taking place, which, in essence, is discrimination in a different form. We have to remember that USC has one of the best LGBT communities in the country. Not every university setting is quite like USC’s, in that regard. Even though official statements say that such a discrimination would never occur, one can never be sure of the true actions that happen in the black box admissions process, especially at other universities. I somehow imagine that universities of a more religious nature would exploit such a question, and might not make the correct and unbiased admissions decision based on that answer. 
Even if such a sexual orientation question were to be an optional part of the application, choosing not to answer the question would still somehow be a statement – practically an answer – to the question. For many, like myself, sexual orientation is not the most significant part of their lives. My admission to a university should not be based on whether I like red or blue, who my favorite character on Glee is, or whether I prefer males or females. For those whose orientation is a significant part, I would definitely advise to take Josh’s actions and write about it in the 1,000+ word essays that are always part of such applications. For those who do not feel that way, you shouldn’t have to be forced to come out to either your parents or your college admissions staff, when you’re stressed out with college admissions processes already.

Yet another crisis has arisen in the Middle East, but this time it is especially disconcerting.
The recent protests against the rule of Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak have raised concerns among the world’s democratic leaders who fear the crisis could have a domino effect in the region, sparking the spread of violent protests in neighboring nations.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
A more dire concern has not been emphasized in the mass media, however — the possibility that Mubarak’s dictatorship could fall to an even more chaotic one by radical Muslim leaders with anti-American sentiments.
It is up to us, the informed young citizens, to raise our voice against inaction. Failure to do so can lead to harmful consequences.
Tensions between Christians and Muslims in this relatively stable Middle Eastern nation heated up after the bombings of Coptic Christian churches in Alexandria by Muslim fundamentalists early in January drew international attention.
Only a few weeks later, Egyptian citizens took to the streets in protest Mubarak’s regime.
These two events are especially eerie considering the danger inherent in the Egyptian crisis.
American citizens, and especially Egyptians, should fear Egyptian rule being seized by most powerful group after the military: the Muslim Brotherhood.
All progress made in Egypt, a key country in shaping our foreign policy in the Middle East, would be destroyed if this group to came to power.
One need only look to the situation in Afghanistan for precedent.
The Mujahideens’ rise to power in the 1970s and 1980s was at first a relief to the Afghan people who were held under Soviet invasion, as they were now free of a foreign militaty presence.
But this feeling of relief did not last long.
As bad as Mubarak’s dictatorial regime and suppression of his people’s rights is, an even worse situation will plague Egypt if the country falls into the wrong hands.
If this were to occur, the fight against terror and the struggle for democracy would be back to a position which only military intervention could fix.
We cannot afford to be in  such a position.
It would take very little effort for the Taliban to gain power in an already unstable region, especially considering the Taliban’s already-established influence over the Muslim Brotherhood.
The Taliban has a very significant presence in nations like Iran and Lebanon,  and it is alarming to think of the impact it could have on international affairs if Egypt were to fall to the Taliban.
But active citizens, especially the younger ones, are taking a stand for maintaining peace in an otherwise chaotic time.
Currently, Egypt’s young people are protecting the Library of Alexandria from ruin. By organizing groups to direct traffic, defend the library from looters and collaborate with the military, these citizens are protecting a vital landmark of their country.
On a higher level, they are defending their people from violent intrusion.
All this isn’t to say that Egyptians will settle for Mubarak’s dictatorial government.
Protesters continue to fill the streets in Cairo, hurling objects and even involving gunfire after nine days of protest.
The United States must step in immediately to restore a stable form of government, not only for the sake of democracy and Egyptian civil rights, but for international security from further terrorism.
Many opportunistic radical groups have historically seized power in unstable nations.
Egypt’s current state of political unrest and the dissatisfaction of the Egyptian people are warning signs that the same thing could take place here.
The most important thing we can do to prevent this is to help restore a stable form of government to Egypt in the form of  democracy.
It is only through the institution of a democratic government and the restoration of the rights of the people that citizens will be satisfied.
Citizen satisfaction and loyalty to the government is what will prevent disillusioned Egyptians from legitimating the power of the Muslim Brotherhood through its support or lack of opposition.
Without such a foundation, fundamentalist terror will surely take root.
The young citizens of Egypt have taken a risk to protect the common good. And we can do the same.

On paper, New York University and the University of Southern California seem like two very similar schools.
But after spending my first two years as an undergraduate at NYU and then transferring to USC this semester, I have noticed significant differences that stem straight from the heart of these similarities.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
Both New York City and Los Angeles teem with millions of intersecting stories, lives and communities. Both  are simultaneously exciting and challenging places to be a student.
Both universities boast a wealth of resources, renowned schools and programs, great faculty and an engaged, diverse student body.
They share a lot of unusual academic characteristics — strong and in-demand undergraduate majors in communication and journalism, extensive internship opportunities that capitalize on their urban settings, and a strong undergraduate reputation within a large private university setting with graduate and professional programs.
Having lived both the NYU and USC experiences, I know first-hand the similarities and differences between the two universities.
It’s understandable why some students end up deciding between the two.
As a campus-less school smack in the middle of downtown Manhattan, to choose NYU is to choose the fast-paced thrill of New York City.
The ways in which NYU overlaps with the city are undeniably exciting, but can be overwhelmingly alienating.
The lack of physical connection leads to a strong sense of emotional disconnection. It also magnifies the sense of being one out of a million. NYU is about being independent personally, academically and socially.
At USC, the athletics, strong Greek-life presence and Trojan pride prove not only an academic connection, but a social connection.
To choose USC is to also choose Los Angeles. Being a part of the university ties students to more than just the campus.
The connections are rooted in, and extend beyond, the physical. USC offers an incomparably strong, long-lasting network of students and faculty.
I laughed the first couple of times I heard the phrase “Trojan family,” but I now feel that it is one of USC’s greatest strengths.
In my choice between the two schools, I was hesitant about choosing USC over NYU, perhaps because aside from their bi-coastal locations, the campuses are so alike.
Prospective students who are deciding between  schools like NYU and USC should be aware that the two schools are similar, but diverge critically in their overall educational and social experience.
Though both campuses are conveniently located in urban cities, USC and the Los Angeles area have a history of being interdependent on one another.
Historically, the university’s growth into a highly selective institution has naturally coincided with the city’s growth as one of the major economic, entertainment, and media markets on the globe.
It’s not that either experience is better; they’re simply different cultures.
USC should play to not only the many strengths that it shares with NYU, but also to those that separate it as a university that is truly one with the surrounding community.

What is with these delusional Trojans?  SC is a fine school, but comparing yourself to Penn is just silly.  I realize that the university has gamed the US News ranking system and rocketed up in the past decade or two, but surpassing UCLA in the rankings is only believed in the eyes of USC apologists.  Anyone, honest with themselves, realizes that when only considering the state of California, USC still falls behind Stanford, Cal, Cal Tech, and yes, even UCLA in the eyes of EVERYONE in academia.  This doesn’t even consider some of the smaller colleges in California that have stronger academic reputations.  And on the national stage, the claim of USC being “elite” becomes even more laughable.
USC has vastly improved through the years, and is no longer simply the place for the rich to send their underachieving kids.  I truly hope this trend continues.  But, can we stop with the delusions and self-congratulatory pats on the back?
Tommy T has delusions of granduer. Do you think SC is actually on par with Penn? LMAO.
yeah this article said nothing.  can i have the 5 minutes of my life back?
Let’s not forget, also, that most of NYU’s undergraduate academics suck balls.
I went to high school in NYC and the kids who went to NYU for anything but Tisch were laughed at.
I, like the author, transferred from NYU to USC during my undergraduate career. I loved NYU. I truly enjoyed my experiences  and will cherish my time spent in New York. I will never regret attending both. The academic curriculum and students at both Universities are world-class. 
The author is correct when bringing up the Trojan Family. USC network is like no other. You cannot compare the two schools when it comes to alumni, student, and faculty relationships nourished on and off campus. 
To be a student at NYU is to be a student of New York City. Nearly anything a young mind could want is within reach. You grow up very quickly in that vibrant and expansive culture. I felt more deeply connected to the city than I did the school. That is not necessarily a bad thing.
To be a student at USC is to be a student in balance. While you have the benefits of living in the city of Los Angeles, you have opportunity to be a member of a worldwide community that is not only tight knit, but welcoming. Our football team is a nice touch, too.
While I started as a Violet, I am going to die a Trojan. Fight On!
This article was a complete snooze fest. The costs financing a USC vs. NYU education weren’t even addressed. As a financial aid awardee, USC’s generous aid was a huge lure away from NYC to LA.
Oh. I forgot the most important item that NYU lacks. FOOTBALL
As a Native NYC’er and a USC Dad, I say “Go Trojans”. 2010 Parent’s Weekend was awesome. And I agree w/ TT and Alumni that UPenn is more Comparable. Both USC and UPenn have some green stuff that NYU lacks. GRASS.
I am an NYU graduate.  I agree with the stated obvious in that the two Universities are largely influenced by its membership to a major U.S. city.
However, I believe the writer’s article lacks offering HOW the Universities are both similar AND different.  Despite the express title,” No Two Colleges are Alike”, the author inexplicably focuses on the various similarities between USC and NYU, and merely opines that USC has a stronger social connection compared to NYU.  Is that it?
The author boasts firsthand experience at both Universities.  I agree with “Alumni” in that the author should have provided some of her own personal experiences and/or concrete examples evidencing her point.  Interestingly, this article greatly lacks the point suggested by its presumptive title.  In my opinion, the author simply fails to make a singular point and adequately support it!  I expect more from a Junior-level journalism student. 
NYU SCPS, 2006
the writer is simply stating the obvious. tell me something i don’t know. it would have been more helpful if some personal experiences and examples were included.
and to tommy trojan. i wish that were true, but usc definitely does not compare to upenn. i wish it does though. one day it may.
I believe that we were comparable to NYU 20 years ago. Now, I believe that UPenn is the more comparable east coast university.

Cold War Kids, the indie-rock quartet from Long Beach, Calif., has made some artistic strides, both sonically and lyrically, on its new album Mine Is Yours.
Working with producer Jacquire King — who worked on albums from with artists such as Kings of Leon, Modest Mouse and Lissie — Cold War Kids has extended the reaches of its sound.
Cold War Kids | Creative Commons
With Mine Is Yours, listeners will find that Cold War Kids still maintain some of the minimalist, abrasive edge that made Robbers & Cowards and Loyalty to Loyalty appealing records, with songs like “Louder Than Ever” and “Royal Blue” standing out.
“Louder Than Ever” engenders audio nostalgia that evinces the presence of old Cold War Kids quirks.
Front man Nathan Willett’s passionate voice scorches the ears, accompanied by the incessant clinking of drummer Matt Aveiro’s cymbals and the dissonant, chattery dialogue of Jonnie Russell’s guitar and Matt Maust’s bass.
Minimalism is still present in the quartet’s style, as heard on “Royal Blue”, a stirring song that starts with the simple beat of quasi-bongo drums.
The drums gradually evolve while being joined by simple, lilting guitar riffs and bass lines that, in conjunction and repetition, produce a mesmerizing effect.
Other songs on the album, like “Mine Is Yours,” “Bulldozer” and “Finally Begin” discernibly contain external influences and sonic change.
In some cases, change can be a good thing and can produce tasteful improvements like in “Mine Is Yours,” the first track on the album, and “Bulldozer.”
The opening song launches with a peculiar synthesizer exploiting the Doppler effect and a gentle, vocal chant not characteristic of Cold War Kids’ sound.
Despite the initial oddities, Willett’s later vocals retain the unique design of Cold War Kids, and the other musicians complement each other with nonchalant harmonies that envelope the listener.
“Bulldozer,” the longest song on the album, contains some unfamiliar instrumental effects as well as a new twang in Willett’s voice.
The new effects compliment the musicians nicely, however, showing off the virtuosity of Russell, Maust and Aveiro and revealing Willett’s versatility as a singer.
The stylistic tweaks present in “Mine Is Yours” and “Bulldozer” are bearable but in “Finally Begin,” the listener can blatantly hear gaudy effects on the instruments that make the musicians mesh together.
Although a cool, artistic flourish, this touch strays away from the corrosive qualities of previous Cold War Kids songs like “We Used to Vacation” and “Hang Me Up to Dry.”
Aside from the obvious departures in sound, Willett has changed the band in a different, more ambitious way.
Past Cold War Kids songs, especially from Loyalty to Loyalty, contained made-up characters who possessed sinister flaws or underwent personal revelations, but songs on Mine Is Yours divulge details about Willett, ranging from interpersonal relationships to home-life.
“Sensitive Kid” is a revealing song about Willett’s growing pains.
The front man sings poignant lines like I tried being sweet / it’s buried deep in me and You climb it up, or you cut it down / This is your family tree, alternating between an aching singing-voice and rhythmic, expressive sighs.
Similar sentiments of disclosure can be heard in “Broken Open,” where Willett sings I have been broken open / Was a perfect gentleman / Now I’m smashing champagne, tying cans / Feel like celebrating.
“Broken Open” is a more uplifting piece than “Sensitive Kid” and some of the other tracks on the album, but it is nonetheless a song that pays tribute to a complex episode in Willett’s life.
Although some of the qualitative changes on Mine Is Yours err on the side of distasteful and prove uncharacteristic of Cold War Kids’ aura, very few of the album’s songs are inherently tainted and still have redeeming qualities.
Lyrically speaking, the quartet’s new album triumphs over previous records, as it zealously and boldly conquers new territory.
Mine Is Yours proves to be an album that portrays growth in self-revelation and musical experimentation.

Meat has always been a straightforward means of sustenance.
In fact, little has changed since those good ol’ caveman days, when crude-but-effective spears fashioned out of nothing more than a sturdy hardwood log and sharpened flint were used to bring down buffalo, goat or other animals of choice.
Nowadays, we raise the animals in sheds.
The spears and cavemen have been replaced by bolt-guns and underpaid workers.
But the principle remains the same: Find animal, kill said animal, butcher, enjoy.
Believe it or not, this might soon be the “old-school” way of harvesting meat.
That’s because a scientist working at the Medical University of South Carolina has made new strides toward growing muscular tissue in a laboratory environment.
Of course by “muscular tissue,” I mean meat.
Yes, the kind of meat that you sprinkle with salt and throw on the grill.
According to Reuters, the project is being run out of a small lab and helmed by one man, Dr. Vladimir Mironov, with a radical new solution to the problem of sustaining meat production worldwide.
Mironov is one of the few scientists around the world that is working on bioengineering “cultured” meat.
With the help of cancer biology scholar Nicholas Genovese, Mironov is attempting to grow slabs of meat in a controlled setting.
In essence, this involves taking embryonic muscle cells, called “myoblasts,” bathing them in a nutrient broth and setting up some sort of foundational “scaffolding” for the cells to grow into.  Mironov has used myoblasts from turkey and used a bovine serum as the growing agent, with chitosan to serve as the supporting polymer.
With luck, these minimalistic elements will grow into muscle tissue that we could eat, but with a few more modifications to make it taste more like old-fashioned meat.
“How do you want it to taste?” Mironov said to Reuters. “You want a little bit of fat, you want pork, you want lamb? We design exactly what you want. We can design texture.”
Mironov and Genovese see this “cultured” meat as a means of curbing the unsustainable use of land for cattle farming, which is a growing problem, as well as the enormous quantities of grain and green matter needed to feed cattle.
And on top of it all, Genovese noted that lab-grown meat could be even cheaper than the “heavily-subsidized” factory meat we consume today.
Yet the project has run into some problems, most notably the issue of financing.
“Bringing any new technology on the market, [on] average, costs $1 billion,” Mironov said. “We don’t even have $1 million.”
Although the process of “cultured” meat is growing, no pun intended, in the Netherlands, no major U.S. organization has stepped up to provide long-term funding.
Maybe it’s because the entire process is a little frightening.
“There’s a yuck factor when people find out meat is grown in a lab,” Genovese said.
Yeah, that’s for sure.
A warehouse full of bioreactors growing what Mironov calls “charlem” — “Charleston engineered meat” — doesn’t pique my appetite much.
In fact, it sounds more like one of those awful, early morning SyFy channel movies.
Lab-grown meat is a concept that should scare the hell out of any foodie, meat-eating or otherwise.
Food is something that has developed over the decades with long-running traditions and mutual respect for the product.
Even today’s most progressive cuisine is crafted by the people who care deeply about the conditions lived by their lamb, the simple patience behind a perfectly ripe tomato and the waters that a fish lived in.
Food, in the eyes of many who love to eat, is about having a connection to the bounty of nature.
But Mironov insists that his creation “will be functional, natural, designed food.”
“Growing” meat would yield some benefits such as less animal killing, less land waste and smaller carbon footprints.
But let’s get one thing straight. You can’t use the adjectives “natural” and “designed” in the same sentence.
A piece of steak, injected strategically with fat and grown to emulate textures, prodded and observed by scientists, seems far from natural.
Not to mention that the complex flavor of meats is determined by the raising of the cattle and what they’ve been fed.
Could charlem taste the same? I find it hard to believe.
Looking forward in order to combat potential crises is an important task, and Mironov’s innovation is admirable.
Still, we shouldn’t be trying to solve our problems with “more” and “cheaper” as buzzwords, as with lab-grown meat.  Look at what we’ve grown already, thanks to the rise of “more” and “cheaper:” a profit-chasing meat industry, indifferent to both the welfare of the animal and the consumer.
We’ll have to wait and see what becomes of Mironov’s new technology.
But if worst comes to worst, I guess raising a hog in my backyard wouldn’t be so bad.

It is always funny reading someone opine about the evil cruel big business CEO’s that are only interested in profits over some naive understanding of moral behavior. What many people (especially in this sanctimonious Los Angeles) fails to understand if that the industrialization of our food sources (yes that includes farms) is what allows the food industry to provide enough food to the population that has exploded in the last 3-4 generations. Do you honestly think we can even feed all the people in this country if we produced food as we did at the turn of the century? Naive people have some infantile understanding of how reality works. Should we have $15/gallon milk and $65/lb for beef and make animal protein something only the very rich can afford? If we did not have “greedy” corporation looking to speed and maximize production – we would not have the means to feed the population – let’s not be idiotic. You can not have a 21st Cent population being provided by using 19th cent means and methods – regardless what your “organic” Whole Foods” try to perpetuate. BTW, do you even realize how much the suff sold in a Whole Foods comes from conveyor belts as opposed to some handsome, friendly neighborhood farmer as they want you to believe. This “techno-food” is already happening – it is just some p;eople – especially in LA are to gullible to face reality.

There are several key ingredients to producing a successful romantic comedy, including lovable characters, extraordinary writing and most importantly, heart.
James Keach’s Waiting for Forever focuses on the journey of Will (Tom Sturridge), a hopeless romantic who follows Emma (Rachel Bilson), his childhood friend and true love, around the country.
Lovebirds · Emma (Rachel Bilson) and Will (Tom Sturridge) struggle in vain to draw complex characters out of an unoriginal romantic film. - Photo courtesy of Elissa Greer 
The two leads are unquestionably authentic in their respective roles; Will is charming and considerate, reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin in demeanor.
Emma is classically vulnerable and naïve, unable to open her eyes and realize that Will is perfect for her.
The characters are both lovable and audiences would want to sympathize with them, but the film’s awkward storytelling techniques, particularly its over stylized direction and the constant use of flashbacks, prevent them from doing so.
Waiting for Forever fails to find the balance between dialogue and story, which results in a predictable and episodic film.
In the hands of a more talented writer and director, this picture could have had emotional and intellectual depth. At least, they would have presumably given the screenplay several well-deserved rewrites.
In general, contemporary romantic comedies are painfully predictable, and Waiting for Forever is no exception.
There is never a shadow of a doubt regarding how things between Will and Emma will end up.
There are no surprises. No aspect of the film is capable of capturing the audience’s attention or even allowing it to root for the characters.
In a film like this, characters are nothing if they lack motivation, and that’s exactly what Will is missing.
The supporting cast doesn’t offer any significant support to the leads, primarily because of how underwritten and unexciting its characters are.
Will’s brother Jim (Scott Mechlowicz) comes off as arrogant and selfish, while Emma’s parents, Miranda (Blythe Danner) and Richard (Richard Jenkins) serve as stage props in awkward and bizarre scenes.
The absurd sense of humor shared between Miranda and Richard leaves us feeling uncomfortable.
This is especially evident in an emotional moment where the tone of the film abruptly changes as Richard remarks just how unattractive his wife is to him.
Miranda seems clueless in every appearance, and talented character actor Richard Jenkins is forced to overplay his performance due to poor writing.
Still, Waiting for Forever does have some authenticity, where the emotions of the characters begin to surface. Emma’s final moments with her father are painful and touching.
These asides, however, are few and far between, and are disrupted by the awkward tonal changes in the other scenes.
Waiting for Forever has sincerity in small doses, but lacks the necessary arc of an emotional journey.
The film is unsure where to lead its audience due to its impoverished screenplay and, as a result, delivers its warmth and sentimentality in all the wrong moments.
The backbone of the film is Will, a character who could have provided this story with depth.
He is nothing more than a mischievous boy who refuses to grow up, much like Peter Pan.
The real cause of this personality trait, however, is the trauma that Will has experienced.
These issues are addressed but never seriously explored in the film.
Keach flirts with the idea of turning his romantic comedy into something much more dramatic.
Yet the result here is a thematically awkward portrait of an underdeveloped character with no real motivation or depth searching for true love.
It’s difficult to dislike a film like Waiting for Forever, which clearly has heart. Sometimes, though, having heart just isn’t enough.
Rachel Bilson happens to be among my favorite actresses, and for that purpose I will watch the film.  I really liked your article and can completely agree with your thoughts, because what you stated happens to be a recurring problem in today’s films. 
Actually the title made perfect sense to me as ridden can in face be used in that context :)
I believe the word you’re looking for is riddled, not ridden.

A good bar is often like a good first date. You don’t want to show up early and look overeager, and you definitely don’t know what to expect. But the final product, a significant other, or in this case a decent buzz, is totally worth it. Silver Lake’s Beer Bar is no exception.
Nestled in a strip mall between obscure restaurants, convenience stores and dry cleaners, Beer Bar is so new that there isn’t even a sign outside yet.
Pushing your way through the dark door without knowing for sure if it’s even the right place feels a bit odd, but once your senses absorb the warm lighting and friendly chatter, any reservations dissolve.
Old-school neon beer lights give bargoers a taste of what’s to come. The 60-plus bottles lining shelves behind the bar are further indication of what you might find yourself drinking at the aptly named Beer Bar if you couldn’t already guess — beer!
But don’t think that the singular class of beverage will leave your taste buds thirsting for something else.
An extensive variety of frothy brews makes each new sip an adventure. Travel to California, the greater United States, Belgium or all of Europe just by exploring this region-specific beer menu.
Simply scanning the long menu, which includes the alcohol content and brewery location for each listed beer, might not help you decide which brew to choose, but the friendly bartenders certainly will.
They’ll let you sample a few beers, or simply ask you what you normally drink and choose for you.
How they keep the different beers’ unique tastes and qualities organized in their minds is an impressive mystery. And since most of the beers are bottled, how they even find the right one is a feat itself.
Despite Silver Lake’s reputation as a too-cool-for-school, hipster paradise, Beer Bar’s staff remains unpretentious. The clientele seems amicable, and the entire bar has a sense of neighborhood ease.
The limited Southern menu, fried chicken and fries with sides ranging from baked beans to fried okra, is prepared in the neighboring Thai restaurant’s kitchen, which Beer Bar shares along with a bathroom.
Although the menu is short and somewhat random in fare, the food is satisfying and well-prepared. The fries and chicken were perfectly crunchy and not greasy, the ideal food to wash down with any of the bar’s delicious beers.
The hunting memorabilia opposite the long bar might inspire a carnivorous mindset once you get a good buzz going. The kitschy decorations, complete with a wall-sized tree mural, make Beer Bar feel like your grandpa’s basement, in a good way.
Of course, the beers themselves are buzz-worthy, even compared to trendier beer bars in wider Los Angeles such as Wurstküche. With names like Russian River Damnation, Bitch Creek, Denogginized Double IPA and Hair of the Dog, how could you not get smashed?
After a few beers, the tiny bar, probably no more than two arm-lengths across plus the bar banquet, is your oyster.
Luckily, customers are allowed to play shuffleboard bowling in the back of the bar after 10:30 p.m., when the restaurant next door closes.
The antique game machine is surprisingly entertaining, especially since it’s made for up to six players at once.
Although Beer Bar is a bit of a hike for USC students, it’s a welcome alternative to the overplayed, the mega-sized nightclubs of Hollywood, the anonymous bars in Downtown Los Angeles and the claustrophobic inside of the 9-0 Bar & Grill.
The parking lot is miniscule and street parking is tricky, but at least you’re not paying for valet. Silver Lake clientele might still possess that hipster sensibility, but Beer Bar maintains a “come one, come all” approach to good beer and good company, something every bar could take a cue from.
Beer Bar is located on 2853 Sunset Blvd. in Silver Lake and is open Mon – Sun from 5 p.m. to 1:30 a.m.
Silverlake is actually closer to USC than Hollywood.
University Arizona Beverage…
[…] me one, come all” approach to good beer and good company, something every bar […]…

USC’s recruiting class was strengthened even more when Marqise Lee from Serra (Gardena, Calif.) committed to play for the Trojans over Oregon and Miami.
“It feels great to be able to play with my best friends, George Farmer and Robert Woods,” Lee said in an announcement. “I could play on either side of the ball, but I think they’re going to start me out on offense at receiver. I’m just very comfortable at USC and the more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea of staying close to home.”
Lee rejoins his high school teammates in what will be a solid young core for the Trojans. Lee, a four-star athlete according to Yahoo! Sports’ Rivals.com, has the capability to play both sides of the ball but is expected to contribute most likely at the safety position.
“I’ll probably play offense, but if I have to play defense, I will,” Lee said. “Whatever gets me on the field quicker. I’m comfortable with offense or defense. It doesn’t matter to me.”

Since the first movie adaption of James Patterson’s novel Along Came a Spider in 2001, the series has stayed alive both through new novels and films.
The newest film adaptation, however, will have quite a twist. Instead of the distinctly deep-voiced Morgan Freeman playing the ever-busy, bad-guy-fighting detective Alex Cross, Tyler Perry will portray the character. The role will the be the first one in which Perry does not appear in his own film. What’s more, the character of Alex Cross does not call for an outlandishly comic wig or costume of any sort.
The movie will be directed by Rob Cohen, known for films such as The Fast and the Furious and The Mummy:Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.
The collaboration between the two will undoubtedly provide a new twist on the suspenseful, psychologically deep stories of Alex Cross. It might also prove that Tyler Perry can step outside his comfort zone and prove his acting skills.

The Los Angeles Time’s Lineman of the Year Troy Niklas will sign with Notre Dame over USC Wednesday. The 6-foot-5, 265 lbs Anaheim native played for Servite High School as an offensive tackle and tight end, while putting some time in on the defensive line as well.
Scout.com ranks the four-star prospect as the No. 8 offensive tackle in the 2011 recruiting class. As one of the premier Southern Californian lineman, he announced in January that he was deciding between Notre Dame and USC.
While Niklas hoped to attend Stanford initially, his academics prevented him from being admitted by the Cardinal.

USC nabbed an important recruit this morning in four-star defensive tackle Christian Heyward.
Heyward, who is ranked as the sixth best defensive tackle in the country by Yahoo! Sports’ Rivals.com, chose the Trojans over Oregon and San Diego State.
Heyward said that former San Diego State coach Brady Hoke’s decision to go to Michigan influenced his choice to come to USC.
“It was the best decision for me in the end,” Heyward said as he announced his decision on live TV this morning.
The 6-foot-2, 275-pound tackle starred at tight-end at Point Loma high school in San Diego, but USC linebackers coach Joe Barry, who primarily recruited Heyward, said his athleticism really stands out on the basketball court.
“He is a 275-pound cat” Barry told USCTrojans.com. “He is quick on his feet, very agile. You can tell a lot about a kid when he is on the basketball court. Just to see a 275-pound athlete move up and down the court, move laterally, side-to-side, bend his knees, catch the ball, go to the hole, that was really impressive. Pass rush is no different than one-on-one basketball.”
It’s another top 100 signing for coach Lane Kiffin, as Heyward is ranked the 80th best prospect nationally by Scout and 94th by Rivals.

In continuing with a recent trend, USC beat Ohio State, again.
But this time it came in February.
The Trojans made a big move on signing day as they swiped offensive lineman Aundrey Walker from the Buckeyes. Walker announced his decision at his high school Glenville High in Cleveland, Ohio.
This is a big pickup for the Trojans as offensive line was arguably their biggest need. Walker, who comes in at a gargantuan size at 6’6”, 355 lbs, is rated the No. 1 guard by Rivals, No. 9 by Scout and No. 15 by ESPN.
Walker could start right away, as USC needs to replace three linemen, including junior right tackle Tyron Smith, who left early for the NFL Draft and is expected to go in the first round.
Walker told Scout.com that immediate playing time and his relationship with recruiting coordinator Ed Orgeron impacted his decision.
“USC has a great coaching staff and it’s a nice place,” Walker said. “The school is great itself. I’m surrounded by a group of good people.
It also didn’t hurt that his recruiting visit coincided with his 18th birthday.
“That night we had a little kick back, a little party for my birthday,” Walker said. “We had a great time. L.A. is great man. The coaches showed me a lot of love.”

USC not only continues to fill holes on its roster with bodies, but also with nationally-recruited talent.
This morning, linebacker Lamar Dawson, who was reticent about his plans in the weeks leading up to today, announced that he will don the cardinal and gold next fall. Dawson, rated as a Rivals four-star recruit, has both the size and speed to excel at both inside and outside linebacker. Dawson had considered offers from upwards of ten universities, including Oregon and Tennessee, but presumably viewed the Trojans’ depleted linebacker corps as an opportunity to play early.
After announcing his decision live on the Louisville Courier-Journal’s website, Dawson said, “USC was my best visit, and I got along well with the players and especially the coaches. I got to know coach (Joe) Barry real well, and then he came out and met my mom on the visit.”

Delvon Simmons, a four-star defensive tackle recruit from McKeesport, Pennsylvania, has signed his letter of intent with the University of North Carolina. With no shortage of suitors, Simmons had offers from USC, Oregon and Iowa among others. According to ESPN.com, he is the 25th best defensive tackle prospect in the 2011 class.
This decision is surprising to an extent, as some had speculated that he had whittled his decision down to USC and Oregon.
Nonetheless, Simmons represents a huge coup for the Tar Heels along the defensive line, as the team continues to recruit a top-20 class despite its struggles in 2010.
Undoubtedly, the acquisition of DT Christian Heyward (San Diego) lessens the sting for the Trojans—a team which needs to retool both its offensive and defensive lines.

Linebacker Kent Turene, a long time commit of USC, decommitted this weekend and signed to play for the University of Georgia Wednesday.
Turene, who made a verbal commitment to the Trojans seven months ago, is a 6-foot-2, 225-pound linebacker from Boyd Anderson High School in Lauderdale Lakes, Fla. He decided to visit Georgia, Texas Tech and Nebraska in January despite his ties to USC, and announced his decision today to join the Bulldogs.
As a four star outside lineman according to ESPN and a three star inside lineman according to Rivals.com, Turene could have contributed greatly to the Trojan team had he not switched his allegiances.

Former USC quarterback Mitch Mustain was arrested Tuesday night on suspicion of selling prescription narcotics, according to reports appearing in multiple media outlets.
Mustain, 22, was eventually released from jail, however, after posting a $30,000 bail, Los Angeles Police Department officials told Gary Klein of the Los Angeles Times.
The arrest reportedly occurred at 8:10 p.m. Tuesday. The former Trojan signal caller was later booked on a felony narcotics charge at a West Valley-area police station.
In 2010, Mustain had served as the backup for Matt Barkley and started the team’s Nov. 27 game against Notre Dame, which resulted in a 20-16 victory for the Irish.

After much speculation on which school he’d choose, Jalen Grimble has reportedly made a decision.
One of the nation’s most coveted pass rushers will reportedly announce his choice to attend Miami this coming fall, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal.
“It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” Grimble said. “The coaching staff is great. The school’s in a nice area. The student-to-teacher ratio is 11-to-1. You could go across the country and that’s hard to find.”
The 6-foot-4, 255-pound defensive lineman from Bishop Gorman High School had verbally committed to USC in May before decommitting.
Grimble has long been considered the top local recruit in the class of 2011 — Rivals.com ranks him the state’s No. 1 overall prospect and No. 20 in the nation among defensive ends.

For over a week, protestors have taken to the streets of Egypt to voice their displeasure with President Hosni Mubarak.  The demonstrations turned violent when police began to use brutal force to crack down on the protestors.  Unconfirmed reports claim that up to 300 people may have so far been killed during the protests.
Mubarak, 82, finally conceding to growing calls for his resignation, announced that he plans not to seek re-election in September.  However, he vowed to finish his term and to spend the remainder of his life in Egypt.  This figures to signal the end of an era for Egypt, which has been ruled by Mubarak for three decades.
The American response to the Egyptian protests has been mixed.  President Obama has yet to directly call for Mubarak’s resignation, but the United States has hardly been convincing in its support for Mubarak, a rare American ally in the Arab World.  Obama said that while it is not the role of any outside country to determine Egypt’s leaders, he indicated to Mubarak that an orderly transition “must begin now.”
John Entelis, director of Middle East studies at New York’s Fordham University, said the Middle East is facing a wave of unrest due to the recent revolts in Tunisia. Other recent demonstrations and protests have occurred in Algeria, Yemen, Jordan, and Sudan.
