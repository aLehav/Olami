The Climate Forward 2021 event kicked off Monday with its first virtual roundtable discussion. The solutions-based climate change conference will take place throughout the week, taking a break on Thursday for both a Wellness Day and Earth Day, according to Kamy Akhavan.
Akhavan, executive director of the USC Center for Political Future, represents one of several organizations involved in Climate Forward 2021. In addition to the Center for the Political Future, both the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies and GRoW@Annenberg will collaborate to host the week-long discussion about climate issues.
Jessica Dutton, associate director for research and engagement at Wrigley Institute, highlighted this collaboration as a key part of the program since its inception in 2019. 
“To truly address climate issues, we need to understand the social and political factors that both underpin the problems and that empower meaningful change,” Dutton said.
The conference brings together leaders from business, government and academia to talk about climate change solutions, Dutton said. Despite the virtual pivot, this year will be no different with a wide cast of speakers scheduled for the week’s panel discussions. 
The discussions will take place throughout the week of April 19, and each day will look at climate change and sustainability through a different lens, from climate and partisanship to climate in business.
Monday’s roundtable was centered on climate justice and examining how some communities are harmed more by climate change and climate-related policies than others. Speakers included the director of the NAACP Environmental and Climate Justice Program as well as Los Angeles City Councilmember Kevin de León.
“People of color [and] people with less means are being disproportionately hurt by a lot of our policies, so we want to be very mindful and focus on solutions for that,” Akhavan said.
Tuesday will see a shift of focus to the business side of climate change and how businesses can and should be held more accountable to mitigate the effects of climate change. Leaders from Microsoft, Patagonia and Ford Motors will attend to discuss their own intentions to mitigate climate change, Akhavan said. 
On Wednesday, panelists will discuss how ideas about climate change vary within and across state and party lines, along with how to communicate with people who hold different perspectives on the issue. Akhavan gave an example of these differences by comparing blue states like California to red states like Texas or Oklahoma.
“There’s a different kind of language, a different kind of appeal, that will really resonate with Republicans and red-state folk more than it will with blue-state and Democrat-leaning folks, so that day is all about understanding what those differences are because we all want the same goal. We want to save our planet,” Akhavan said. 
Speakers will range from a climate scientist to U.S. Rep. Garret Graves.
After the break on Thursday due to the Wellness Day, when participants are encouraged to participate in Earth Day activities like cleaning up public spaces, Climate Forward 2021 will conclude with a conversation with local elected leaders, including California State Sen. Ben Allen, about the future of climate change in Southern California.
Despite a diverse schedule of topics, one theme ties it all together: climate solutions. Akhavan said the motivation behind the creation of the conference was to provide a climate conference that went further than just focusing on the problem of climate change and instead maximized awareness in a constructive and solutions-oriented way. 
“We know the problem is bad,” Akhavan said. “We don’t need to talk about the problems. We need to focus on the solutions.”
Yet the conference had to focus on a problem of its own this year with the move to an online forum.
Despite the shift, the organizers remain steadfast in wanting to bring the conference back for its third year. In past years, the event took place with multiple panels in one day. However, in an effort to combat Zoom fatigue, Akhavan said the panels are spread out over the course of the week. Each day of the conference will consist of a 45-minute panel discussion followed by a brief question and answer session.
“Moving online has obviously limited certain elements of the program, particularly our ability to engage students directly with the speakers,” Dutton said. “That’s been a special part of the event in the past. But with online webinars, we are able to include a wider range of guests from across the country and to try different formats, such as this year’s multi-day series.”
The organizers hope the conversations will connect both the science and policy aspects of climate change to discuss and find real solutions. Oftentimes, climate change can seem too difficult of an issue for one individual to take on, but this is not always the case.
“The purpose of this conference is to make us aware of what we as individuals can do across a variety of the solutions spectrum,” Akhavan said. “ But it’s also intended to show us what can be done more institutionally — more systemically — and how can we contribute to those as well.” 
Other on-campus organizations, such as the Environmental Student Assembly, have encouraged students to attend the conference. Jackson Fitzgerald, executive director of ESA, described what he hoped conference participants would take away from the discussions.
“If they’re able to see these types of figures in those fields talk about these things, then hopefully that can encourage them to both bring sustainability into their current lives and also bring sustainability into the great careers they’re building at the university,” Fitzgerald said.

111 Live wasn’t an in-person concert, but regardless the production value, power of raw performances and attention to detail made the online event feel private and powerful. 
The benefit on Sunday night was to commemorate the one year anniversary of the Happy Hour Fund, a mutual aid organization working out of Washington D.C. and Los Angeles to help financially assist excluded workers, such as sex workers, incarcerated people, workers with disabilities or other people disproportinately affected by the pandemic. All proceeds from the event were donated to the fund.
During the event, Happy Hour Fund Cofounder Ayu explained that they help workers by “using the money we would be using to go out to dinner, to happy hour, to go out and actually donating that money to the people who are keeping our lives going every day.”
According to River, another cofounder, the Happy Hour Fund has raised more than $30,000 to help these workers, and has worked with many other organizations to help people who are struggling due to the pandemic.
The livestream started with a car, friends picking each other up just to drive around and listen to music. It felt like the viewer themselves was experiencing the beginning of a fun night, full of potential. The hosts, DJs Kute and Kozy mixed music from the backseat, “providing the vibes” while Keilani Snyder, who did art promo design for the event, and director and set designer Minh Han Vu danced in the front as they drove. The car was lit red as they made their way through an L.A. neighborhood, but the light changed throughout the night along with the music as the video feed cut between the hosts and the musicians. 
The first performer at the benefit was singer-songwriter Hannah Abrahim, a junior majoring in popular music performance. She was sitting criss cross on a bed outdoors, surrounded by plants and candles. It was dark, lit mainly by blue and purple colored lights, and it had the feeling of candlelight. Paige Thibault, a sophomore majoring in popular music performance, played piano and sang background vocals alongside her. Though the set was highly designed, her performance itself was simple, emotional and impactful as she debuted two of her original songs. She, along with all the performers of the night, sang to no audience, which gave her performance a feeling of intimacy missing from some large concerts. 
Next was Kid Hastings, a junior majoring in music industry, dressed in a yellow jumpsuit and a bucket hat, who played an unreleased song called “Off Guard,” set to come out in the next week. He also played “Frame of Mind” and “Star.” He was in the same outdoor setting, but sitting in a chair, surrounded by plants and blue light with only a microphone, his guitar, a wine glass filled with roses and a stack of books. 
Then, bathed in golden light, came Helena Holleran, a singer-songwriter from San Diego. Behind her was a moving light display reminiscent of a sunset, giving the entire set a feeling of coziness. As part of her set, she played an unreleased song called “Falling in the Sympathy of Youth.” 
Jordyn Simone, lit in red and pink was the penultimate act. She sang on a stool while co-songwriter Liza Kaye played piano in the background. Fitting with the colors of her set, she sang an unreleased song called “Burn,” which is to be released soon. She described this song as “emotional, dramatic, cinematic.” 
Last in the lineup was Kyle Lux, a junior majoring in popular music performance. His set was dimly lit green, as moving shadows danced on the wall behind him. He was accompanied by live cajon, violin and guitar at different points in his set. He sang his song “Rolling Stone,” which has nearly six million streams on Spotify. 
The online concert came to a close as our hosts in the car pulled into a parking lot overlooking Downtown and got out of the vehicle as the credits rolled, while one last opportunity to donate to the Happy Hour Fund came across the screen. 
The creativity and time spent on this event shone through.
Instead of trying to replicate what a live concert might feel like, with loud noise from the crowd and tons of instruments, the creators of this event created something totally new and engaging. The way each performer sang directly to the camera, with minimal instrumentals and editing, along with the thoughtful set design and lighting provided emotion and soul to each person’s performance, led to an intimate, lovely experience. The event raised $659 for excluded workers by the end of the night.

“But maybe tomorrow will feel better / I’ll try to write a song or two”
Similar to their latest song “Maybe Tomorrow” inspired by their “quarantine crazies,” pop twin duo JaJa Tong and JoJo Tong have been going through life writing and producing music. Classically trained and playing the piano from the age of four, they now release music inspired by pop, alternative and country/folk genres under their stage name Goldlove.   
“[Music] definitely played a major role in shaping our 19 years on this planet,” JaJa said. “Growing up it was something that we had every week, piano lessons, band practice, everything, and that took a lot of time, but for both of us, it’s also something that keeps us going and makes us really happy throughout the day, and it lets us relax.”
Although JaJa goes to USC and JoJo goes to NYU, the two find ways to collaborate through late night phone calls on opposite coasts. Going to two different highly reputable music schools has helped the duo develop different skills and the opportunity to work with talented artists. 
“There’s one funny story where [JaJa] was calling me at 10 p.m. her time but it was 1 a.m. for me. So my roommates were asleep,” JoJo said. ”And I was just laying under the covers … speed texting back because I didn’t want to wake up my roommates. And so I think we’ve had a lot of stories like that.“
Following their classical training at a young age, the duo progressed to band in middle school and high school, learned guitar along the way as they produced and wrote songs with the help of YouTube tutorials. Initially, credited as producers and working behind the scenes on writing and producing songs for other student artists in high school, the duo decided to start releasing music as Goldlove in 2020. 
“The first music we actually started out writing was classical, so we used to write classical piano pieces, orchestral things, things for Symphonic Band. And then we kind of just realized we don’t listen to classical music on a daily basis. Why would we write that like no one else is gonna listen to it?” JaJa said. “So we started writing what we wanted to hear, which was just pop songs. And then once we got into writing pop songs, it just kind of snowballed from there and we learned about production.”
But the two don’t want to be pigeonholed into one genre or style. Instead, they take inspiration from what they’re listening to at the moment. This has led to a portfolio where each song ranges in style, sometimes seamlessly blending multiple genres into one track. 
“A lot of what we’re trying to make is based on what we’re into at the moment. And a lot of times it’s based on a song that we heard that we really like,” JaJa said. “If you dig deep enough, you can notice that each song kind of has a reference song. So ‘Listen’ has very Sam Smith vibes. ‘Don’t take it personal’ is a blend of Charlie Puth’s slow mix song with Meghan Trainor.” 
One such song is “Drug” in collaboration with Soph Retief that JaJa said was especially fun to work on despite taking one and a half years of production and going through multiple lyric revisions. Taking inspiration from their classical background, the song starts synthy and electronic before it gets to the bridge where a classical string quartet takes over. 
“I think every song has its own story. So there’s two in particular that have been really unique experiences, and they’ve come a long way,” JaJa said. “If you look at the lyrics, it’s so far off from how it started, but [Drug] was really fun because we got to insert like so many metaphors … my favorite line is ‘I’m a zombie with a beating heart’ and all these crazy ideas that were put into the song made it really fun to write.”
Retief, a graduate student studying songwriting at NYU, has collaborated with the duo on multiple songs, including two that have been released, and said their versatile music style makes it fun to work with them. 
“I think it’s been cool because all their songs are very different styles,” Retief said. “And it’s so interesting to hear because like the songs that we do, there’s kind of like this dark electronic song and then there’s another really light hearted chill pop song and it’s really cool to hear.” 
While Retief hasn’t met them in person, she is impressed by their production skills and the level of thought that goes into each draft of the song before the final version.  
“You can tell they put so much time and thought into every part of the song, and how it should sound like the arrangement,” Retief said. “They send it to me and they’re like ‘This is done on our end, do you have any thoughts?’ and I’m like ‘No, it’s perfect. I love it.’ … I love hearing the song release and I’m glad that other people get to hear it too.”
What starts as an idea that comes to one person in the form of a verse or chords progresses as both JaJa and JoJo take turns working on it giving each other the space to develop the idea until it develops into a song they are both proud of. 
“A lot of our writing doesn’t actually have both of us in the same room writing together,”JaJa said. “Instead, we like to give each other our own space to develop our ideas without any bias from the other person. And then when it gets to production, we kind of do the same thing.” 
The duo has made the best out of transition to remote work, using the opportunity to work asynchronously to produce music with collaborators without having to worry about getting everyone into the studio. 
“Being virtual has given us a lot more opportunities,” JoJo said. “In February, we got to perform at Joy Rockers Club which is the largest virtual Asian music festival in the world, and that opportunity was only possible because of [the coronavirus] because of everyone turning to online concerts instead of physical ones.”
Another collaborator, Tristan Elma, who goes by the artist name Stan Stan Stan, met JaJa through the Songwriters’ Forum. JaJa started the club at USC as a freshman to connect songwriters, producers and performers to create original music together.
“JaJa is a really hard working person,” said Elma, a senior majoring in computer engineering and computer science. “I just know how passionate she is for the industry and I know that she’s taking classes for it, doing extracurriculars too and just how many different projects she has going on and all the different roles she plays in those projects. I know that she works real hard and her music is a really great product of this. And I’ll be listening to her music on Spotify.”
Elma collaborated with the duo on the song “Find You Again,” a pop song with rock and alternative beats.
Currently with five singles lined up to be released over summer, JoJo and JaJa are trying to expand their video presence by making YouTube videos to show fans the behind-the-scenes of their music process. As a production duo, they want to use this as a way to be more relatable to their listeners. 
“We want our listeners to be able to relate to us and find our music and our creative process interesting,” JaJa said. “Making a video series and kind of like lifting the curtain, that’s something that we’re really excited to do in the next couple of months.”
As Asian American women in music, a big challenge they’ve faced is not having any role models to look up to. They have had to constantly prove themselves and show people that music is more than an extracurricular to them. 
“Being Asian Americans working on music is so unconventional and so uncommon, and a lot of times people don’t consider that a real thing,” JoJo said. “Back at home, a lot of people didn’t see that it was actually a passion of ours, until we started getting recognition … it was definitely hard to be as taken seriously at first, but we’re both pretty happy with where we are and where we’re going.”

This review contains spoilers.
It wouldn’t be far-fetched to say that musical movies time-and-again are inherently formulaic.
“Arlo the Alligator Boy,” written and directed by Ryan Crego as an animated Netflix original, is no exception. “Arlo” consciously borrows from some of the most formulaic musical movies, such as the iconic “The Prince of Egypt,” “The Little Mermaid,” and even the almighty “Hercules.” The protagonists of these movies all share one thing in common: the desire to be accepted in a world where they feel they don’t belong. As a more recent take on this age-old theme along with, possibly, too little of an acute awareness of its audience, “Arlo” still passes as a feel-good option that should be considered for a family movie night.
“Arlo” follows the pure, lovable and kind-hearted young alligator boy Arlo (Michael J. Woodard) on his adventure to New York City to find his father. We’re first introduced to Arlo, after viewing a gorgeous opening sequence featuring a classy approach to the art style and a grand orchestration (showing that the creators of the movie took being a musical animation seriously), as a teeny weeny baby alligator abandoned in a basket in the sewer.
The flow of the sewer water eventually carries the basket across the ocean despite being put in multiple dangerous circumstances that possibly could have killed Arlo, in all reality, before being found by Edmee (Annie Potts). Edmee, a caring old woman who hides in the swamp to avoid being arrested as a fugitive in the outside world, eventually takes Arlo in as her own. So, uh, baby Moses in the opening sequence of “The Prince of Egypt,” much?
Fast-forwarding (as coming-of-age stories often do) to teenage Arlo, we learn that Arlo wonders what the world is like beyond the swamp and how’d it be to dwell among humans other than his adopted mother Edmee; he is given her blessing to leave the swamp to find his father who he believes lives in New York City. 
Arlo as well as side characters including the tough but otherwise gentle Bertie (Mary Lambert) expresses all of his deepest desires through –– you guessed it ––– song, and one can really see how hard the creators tried to place importance on the concept of music in this film, lest we forget it’s a musical. Much of the more vivid and colorful pieces of animation are saved for musical sequences, showing audiences the extent of Arlo’s imagination and that of his peers, which would definitely appeal to younger viewers. That’s not to say older audiences wouldn’t appreciate the musical numbers. If not for the animation, then older age groups will definitely have appreciation for the jaw dropping talent of Woodard and Lambert, especially during any time the two have a duet. Woodard’s smooth and controlled tenor timbre coupled alongside Lambert’s light and floaty mezzo suits the R&B style of music the movie chooses to roll with.
On his journey to find his father, Arlo meets a few more characters that honestly don’t add much to the overall plot of the story despite, after dropping Arlo off to see his father, becoming Arlo’s best friends. He meets a literal talking pink fur ball who tries too hard to come across as a drag queen named Furlecia (Jonathan Van Ness), who unironically is also obsessed with her own hair. 
Other than Furlecia being the most LGBTQ+ representation the audience will get out of an animated kids movie in the most menial way, her and the other members of Arlo’s new chosen family at the end do not progress the story in any way aside from the writers’ attempts at lackluster humor that center around only one aspect of each of their personalities, which sadly does more harm than good in regards to Furlecia’s character. While children can easily be mesmerized by a tiny Italian man from “Little Italy” who loves pizza like Tony (Tony Hale), or a cat who, even until the very end of the movie, doesn’t know much about driving, like Alia (Haley Tju), older viewers may have to rely on other aspects of the movie in order to enjoy it. 
That being said, despite its failed attempts at creating interesting side characters, the message of “Arlo” isn’t a bad one, but it is one we’ve seen over and over again. Upon meeting his father (who chooses to deny the fact until a big revelation at the very end), Arlo receives advice from him telling him that if he wanted to make it in the world, Arlo needed to change himself, leaving him even more confused than he already was, before entering his “lowest point” as the protagonist.
Throughout the movie, the audience has witnessed Arlo go through life as the positive little gator he is, so seeing him walk with his head down through the gloomy streets of New York, contrasted with their portrayal of having bustled with color and life in previous scenes, is essentially heartbreaking. But, after two (which is already one too many) sad songs in a row, that included a reprise and a rap by Arlo, audiences can’t help but notice how his spirit was uplifted a lot faster compared to how he lingered through the drag of his past few scenes.
Notice how the antagonists of the film (who did exist by the way) were not alluded to at all within this review, and the reason for this being that it would have been best if “Arlo” had none at all, leaving Arlo’s self-discovery arc to itself. The so-called villains of “Arlo” are the poachers Ruff (Flea) and Stucky (Jennifer Coolidge) who want to make money off of Arlo as their newest attraction in the crooked-con business they own.
Aside from taking part in nonsensical comedic chase and fight scenes, their “evil” was left to the extent of spitting on the ground at the most random times and littering. It also doesn’t help that in the end, the two suddenly reform and forget their villainous motivations because they, as Ruff puts it, were moved by having “learned things about the human experience,” which could probably be the laziest way to end an antagonist’s arc. The only upside we get out of their characters is meeting their pet, or the seemingly terrifying “Beast,” which in reality is the most massive dog, and comes a close second to Arlo as the cutest character of the film.
In the end, Arlo learns the value of friendship and to accept his uniqueness as an alligator boy, after choosing to reject his rich father’s offer to live luxuriously with him (a rather Hercules-esque move by Arlo). Instead, he decides to live with his friends, finally making them important to the plot, and closes off the show with an upbeat finale song that ironically, although featuring the animation of Arlo and all his friends, only includes the voices of Arlo and Bertie, which is more than telling on the lack of importance the rest of them have in regards to the overall film.
“Arlo the Alligator Boy” although (surprisingly) not a Disney or Dreamworks film, follows the tropes of many of the works produced by such companies. This only goes to show how much these films rely on a certain formula that younger audiences are fine with consuming over and over again. But, on the bright side, we can rely on the fact that these children now, like us who were once in their shoes, will eventually begin to realize that even beautiful animation and super catchy music can’t continue to hide the same story disguised in different “fonts” and the character misrepresentation that they expect us to accept.

While living in San Francisco, USC alumni Chase Mitchell and Brian Bloch loved to visit parks. During their visits, the pair noticed a “huge park culture” in the city, with people frequently holding large picnics. Experiencing the firsthand trouble of carrying a cooler gave them the idea to start their business venture: Chill Systems. 
“People go out [to the parks] drinking their beers. They’re hanging out, [with] massive picnics [of] thousands of people at a time in the parks in San Francisco,” Mitchell said. “The problem with that was lugging around a cooler was a pain.” 
Mitchell and Bloch looked for an effective and mobile solution for cooling beverages, and created Chill Systems in July 2018. In mid-March, the team pitched their company on ABC’s hit TV show, “Shark Tank.” 
“[We] thought for a long time about wanting to start something and be entrepreneur[s], and [we’ve] been inspired by shows like ‘Shark Tank’ for a long time,” Mitchell said. 
The Chill Systems cooler can fit three 12-to 16-ounce drinks in its three compartments, or one large bottle in its large hole. It includes a freezing gel that lasts six hours and is made from recycled materials.  
“When it comes to actually using [the cooler], you use less energy and you can use less single-use plastics,” Bloch said. “It saves you time, money and the environment, so all across the board, we think that it’s a great product.”
Mitchell and Bloch originally met working as drivers for USC’s Campus Cruiser program and lived next door to each other on Greek Row. Following their graduation in 2014, they both decided to move and live together in San Francisco to pursue their jobs, Mitchell in sales at Google and Bloch as a financial analyst at Apple. 
“I wouldn’t even know [Mitchell] if not for USC,” Bloch said. “USC is the fulcrum of our partnership, so it’s wonderful to be a part of the USC family.” 
According to Bloch, the pair began working on Chill Systems a few years into their jobs before launching a Kickstarter campaign in the summer of 2018. After raising $53,000 over 50 days, Mitchell and Bloch left their corporate jobs to pursue Chill Systems full-time. 
When first beginning their company, Mitchell turned to Stacy Geck, an associate professor of clinical business communication, to bounce ideas off of. 
Geck met Mitchell on a study abroad program, “Learning about International Commerce,” based in Singapore in 2011. The program consists of a 2-unit course for first-year business students, allowing them to gain exposure to international companies and work on global business projects. 
“It’s nice to see our students learn not only to identify their skill sets, but also to use their skill sets to be able to better themselves in business,” Geck said. “I’m excited for [Mitchell] and his partner and their business to be able to put it out there for the rest of the world to see.”
When teaching about business, Geck said she tells all of her students that they need to be genuine, passionate and real. 
“When those things are combined well, it really is a wonderful mixture for success for those who are going out there in the business world,” Geck said. 
For Bloch, the class “The Entrepreneurial Mindset- Taking the Leap” taught him the most valuable life lessons about growing a business and promoting an affirmative mindset. The course, taught by David Belasco, an adjunct professor at the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, brings in guest speakers to speak about “high performance mindset.” 
“The entrepreneurial mindset was the idea. You’re going to have to just take a leap and jump in the pool, in the deep end, and figure it out,” Bloch said. “The nature of entrepreneurship is you don’t know what you’re doing necessarily when you’re starting, because you have to figure it out as you go.” 
Mitchell said appearing on “Shark Tank” was a “once in a lifetime experience.” 
“It was awesome being on the other side, from having watched the show for so many years, and actually being in the room was really surreal,” Mitchell said. “You can imagine the anticipation buildup, walking into that room. It’s like, ‘Wow, I can’t believe I’m here doing this.’”
Bloch said it was “really cool” to interact not only with the crew and staff working on the show, but the other entrepreneurs pitching their ideas to the “Sharks” as well. Although Chill Systems did not receive an offer on the show, the pair are continuing to work on growing their company. 
“It was something that we really got passionate about and started building ourselves, which was really cool,” Bloch said. “It’s cool to just totally build something from scratch.” 
Bloch said finding an intersection between what he and Mitchell liked to do and the needs of consumers was the key to Chill Systems’ success. 
“That’s really [Mitchell]’s, and my story,” Bloch said. “We saw a need for a product that we wanted ourselves and so we said, ‘Well, how can we do that? How can we provide that?”’
Mitchell said that “mentality is really important” in entrepreneurship, and that new entrepreneurs need to be “self-motivated.”
“You need to believe in yourself. You need to believe in the project you’re working on, and you need to be motivated to show up and just keep working on it,” Mitchell said. “Keep your eyes on the prize and just keep showing up and keep moving in that direction.”

Students are battling exhaustion as the spring semester approaches an end. In previous years, students would look forward to spring break to give them a breather from the demands of the semester and gain the strength to finish strong. 
But, USC decided to take away spring break this year to eliminate the risk of students traveling during the break and increasing transmission risk of the virus. 
Instead, the University implemented wellness days that would be one day of no classes or school-related activities, giving students the chance to have a mental day. 
Students are battling Zoom fatigue, and now without any real break — how can professors expect students to be producing their best work?
They can’t. 
Students have been trying their best to adjust to the major differences in college life. While they are struggling to find normalcy in the last few weeks of the semester and before finals approach, some students feel the need to tell their professors that they are burnt out. However, they may be unable to do so out of fear that professors won’t understand or have empathy. 
The only way students can reach out to professors and see whether they care about the well-being of their students is by scheduling office hours. This can allow students to explain to their professors that they are feeling drained and ask for some encouragement. 
In a survey by the University of Michigan, 83% of students said that their mental health negatively impacted their academic performance, with half of the students saying they struggle with depression or anxiety.
The added pressure of the school year ending and finals season is affecting students’ mindset. While professors may assume that students are being lazy because their cameras are turned off and aren’t engaging in class, students may very well be battling with serious mental health decline. 
Professors have their own deadline and syllabus of certain lesson objectives that have to be reached in a short amount of time, but they can lend a hand by accommodating their students the best way that they can. One way is to give students study days in class or offer to allow them to turn in assignments early so they can have one less class to worry about during finals. Communicating to their students that they are there to help them and not add extra stress would lessen student anxiety by letting them know that their professors are looking out for them. 
Fortunately, as the semester winds to a close, vaccines are being administered at a rate which promises a potential return to campus next fall and eliminates the need to cancel breaks in the future. 
For now, students must hold on knowing that summer is almost here and that the much-needed break is coming. 
On the last couple of wellness days, students may choose to take advantage of the mental health resources and wellness activities including yoga and meditation that are advertised by the University.
Students must remember that they are more than their grades and are human beings that deserve to breathe and relax just like everyone else. They should listen to their body and minds to know when they need to take their break, even if it is not put on the school calendar.

As the United States becomes more and more hopeful of a return to some kind of normalcy with the coronavirus vaccine roll-outs ramping up, colleges around the country are beginning to consider whether they will require their students to be vaccinated before they return to campus in the fall. 
Both Rutgers University and Cornell University have already announced that for the Fall 2021 semester, returning students will be required to be vaccinated against the coronavirus — unless they provide a religious or medical reason for an exemption. Other colleges are expected to follow Rutgers and Cornell’s lead in the coming weeks. 
However, critics point out that all three vaccines on the United States market — Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson — have only been given an emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This is very different from the typical vaccinations required by most colleges such as measles, rubella and meningitis, which have been granted full FDA approval. 
There is no legal precedent for mandating emergency use authorized vaccines to college students. However, there is a history of case law over the last century and a half which supports the idea of mandated vaccinations that support public health, especially those which are communicable and dangerous to the public at large, such as chickenpox, measles, polio and tuberculosis. 
This history of U.S. case law on mandatory vaccinations began in 1905 with the case of Jacobson v. Massachusetts. The Supreme Court in Jacobson ruled that the city of Cambridge, Mass. could fine residents who refused to be vaccinated against smallpox after a smallpox epidemic swept through the Northeast in the early part of the 20th century. The Supreme Court described how important it was for states to protect the public “against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members” and further articulated that a reasonable public health interest may outweigh the interests of a single citizen to reject a vaccine. 
The Jacobson Court limited its holding to the case before it, and subsequent cases on mandatory vaccinations have always considered this same question: how much of a threat is required to justify forcing people to accept a government imposed injection into their person? 
The courts balance the risk of serious injury to the public against the government forcing people to be injected against their will. The Fourth Amendment allows citizens to be secure in our persons and free from unreasonable searches by government action. A vaccination could be perceived as a search for some, and certainly a state school, such as the University of California, Los Angeles or University of California, Santa Barbara, is a government actor. So where does that leave private institutions such as USC?  
Pfizer is expected to apply for full FDA approval this month. Moderna and Johnson & Johnson will undoubtedly follow shortly thereafter, removing the emergency use authorization argument against mandating the coronavirus vaccine. But, even assuming these three vaccines are still only in the emergency use phase of distribution by Fall 2021, universities — especially private ones like USC — should mandate coronavirus vaccinations in the interest of public health.
In December, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunities Commission granted general acceptance to private employers to mandate coronavirus vaccination for their employees. The only exceptions that employers can allow are religious or medical exemptions. 
Like private employers, USC and other private institutions of higher learning should mandate the vaccination of its students this fall — absent a religious or medical reason. It would be perfectly reasonable for USC to require those seeking an exemption to the vaccine based on religious or medical reasons to be regularly tested for the coronavirus weekly or bi-weekly, without proof of immunization. 
As Jeffrey J. Nolan, a senior lawyer at Holland & Knight who specializes in education and employment law, said “If a student chooses to come to an institution, they agree to abide by the rules and some of those are pretty intrusive, but they are often necessary. It doesn’t mean someone won’t litigate it, but I see less nuance when it comes to the student-side of things than the employment-side of things.”

Before I blast Hall & Oates on Spotify, I often get the same Postmates ad because I’m too lazy to get Spotify Premium. I never truly paid attention to the ad until I finally decided to cave into consumerism and see why it kept popping up. 
The premise was simple, a subliminal messaging plot about getting pad thai, hidden underneath a stereotypical medication commercial (you know, the one where older people run around and do random activities while a piano plays softly in the background). After I decided that maybe pad thai was the move for dinner, I found my inner gerontologist stirred up by the portrayal of older adults in that 30 second commercial.
These ads, either the ones that have no immediate impact on your life or those which creep you out because of how relevant they are, are a facet of social media and the digital age that persists today. 
Take a quick step back, maybe a few years or so. Think about Mr. Six, the so-called mascot of Six Flags, dancing and encouraging members of a boring, mundane neighborhood to hop onto his bus for an exciting trip to the theme park. The dance moves are ecstatic, fluid and, most importantly, catchy. 
But what caught the attention of many viewers was not necessarily the dance moves but the dancer himself, Mr. Six. He’s not a sprightly, young man but rather is portrayed as a bald “old guy” with large-rimmed glasses. He represented an endless youth, where biological age could not and would not restrict the enjoyment and energy that comes with a trip to Six Flags. 
Certainly there are several implications with using an older adult as the tool to bring children to an amusement park, but the use of older adults in that context has since become a thing of the past. 
Since then, the portrayal of older adults has been consistently restricted to pharmaceutical and retirement commercials. The new wave of advertisements featuring older adults seems to exaggerate in either an extremely positive or negative light — both of which have their own respective repercussions. 
While these eye-catching exaggerations certainly garner attention and revenue, the common consumer may take these stereotypical portrayals to heart and generate new implicit attitudes based off of them. 
An eye-catching advert about the importance of young people going to the polls and consequently “knock the vote,” was the “Dear Young People” advertisement from NAIL Communications, aired in 2018 prior to the November midterm elections. The video, which has ascertained almost 900,000 views on Youtube alone, caught the attention of many consumers due to its incredibly provocative and negative portrayal of the “Baby Boomer” generation. 
The one minute advert challenges younger voters — only 46% of which voted in the last election — to show up at the polls through the portrayal of selfish older adults who seem to abide solely by their own agenda.
One provocative stereotype employed by the voting commercial involved the issue of school shootings, where an older woman explained that she had not “been in a school for 50 years,” distancing herself from the atrocities of lackluster gun control. The “generation of doers, not whiners” has made their case against the youth.
“But Lois,” you, the inquisitive reader asks. “Isn’t the point of the commercial simply to shock and awe people into voting? Older adults are already voting so it makes sense that this commercial targets younger demographics.”
It is true that older adults have been shown to consistently participate in civic engagement programs like voting, but that does not necessarily mean that all older adults pursue the conservative, right-winged mindset nor does it mean that older adults have no sympathy for younger generations. 
Many older adults have families and grandchildren who would be impacted by gun violence in schools; moreover, to say or think that older adults don’t care about deaths due to school shooters is outrageous. The flames of intergenerational warfare are stoked with every slide and line in this video, with the gap widening for those with already negative attitudes on the older out-group. 
The negative stereotypes have simply been a product of blindness to ageist attitudes in society. Attributing aging to fragility and weakness has exploded over social media through jokes and memes that play into excluding the social out-group, which, for the case of many young or adolescent individuals, was older adults. 
In lieu of recent political turmoil and disagreement, the intergenerational gap between older and younger audiences has grown to unprecedented levels. Companies and shows have taken advantage of these misunderstandings as an opportunity to gain profit by separating the two groups from one another via ageism and ageist stereotypes. 
On the flipside, Nike’s “Unlimited Youth” campaign featured Triathlon Hall of Famer Sister Madonna Buder, who was 86 years old when the commercial was filmed in 2016. For many, this lighthearted commercial provided hope for activity paired with longevity. Sister Buder’s 45 Ironman challenges are a testament to her physical endurance and strength, but Nike connects it with her age, creating unintended consequences. 
While Sister Buder is supported by her fellow contestants in the commercial, her endeavours are idealistic and display an example of what “successful aging” looks like. This unrealistic portrayal of older adults going above and beyond can hurt older adults currently not in that physical shape or incapable of transforming into that stature. Younger audiences can certainly aspire to be like that at Sister Buder’s age, but many older adults — while they are able to learn new things — might not be able to complete an Ironman competition. 
The marketing and advertising world today is incredibly vast and successful in producing content that can be quickly digested for the general audience. Why not make that content age-friendly to stimulate realistic intergenerational conversations? Now’s the time to realize and fix the consequences of ageism, for it is not only helping current older adults but also paving the way for the future of longevity around the world. Maybe that Postmates ad in the future will look a little bit different before I get back to listening to Hall & Oates. But for the meantime, I’ll be hoping that I get to reflect back on all the changes we’ve made thinking, “Back in my day…”

I almost don’t even know where to start with this. Twelve of the top soccer clubs in Europe announced the formation of a “Super League” Sunday.  
The competition will take place midweek, effectively replacing the UEFA Champions League, Europa League and eventually, domestic league football. The Super League will feature 20 teams; the 12 founding members, three clubs to be named later and five clubs who play their way into the tournament. 
The 12 founding members, along with the three clubs to be named later, cannot be relegated from the league and gain automatic entry into the competition every year, regardless of performance in the competition or domestically. 
The Super League features the top clubs from England, Spain and Italy, meaning the clubs in those countries left out of the competition will be at a massive disadvantage, both financially and in player recruitment. The most popular, and profitable, clubs in three of Europe’s top-five leagues have abandoned the traditional play-in model for European competition, where teams have to finish at certain spots in the standings to qualify for the UEFA Champions League and Europa League. The clubs involved in these tournaments changed every season, depending on results in domestic leagues across Europe. Now, the Champions and Europa League, tournaments that gave soccer fans some of the most iconic moments in the sports’ history, are being replaced by Super League. 
Instead, the 12 founding clubs, among them Real Madrid, Manchester United and Juventus have chosen to lock themselves into automatic qualification as part of a new, elitist competition that effectively ends fair competition for the vast majority of clubs in England, Spain and Italy. Qualifying for the Super League will likely be all but impossible for lower-level clubs, and without any real incentive to chase fight for, clubs left out of the Super League will continue to lose fans, players and revenue. Almost every player will have aspirations of playing in the Super League, an opportunity only a small handful of teams will be able to offer.
The selection process for the Super League was hardly based on performance. Clubs such as Arsenal and Tottenham were selected despite finishing behind teams who were not selected for the Super League.
The elite clubs outside of Europe’s most popular five leagues, the same clubs that regularly beat clubs in the top five, will have little to fight for with their Champions and Europa League dreams, and ultimately the soul of the sport of soccer will being sacrificed in favor of profit. 
Make no mistake, this decision is strictly about money. Fans oppose it. Former players oppose it. Managers oppose it. 
It seems the only people that want this to happen are those who will financially benefit from it. And they also happen to be the people who make the decisions — the owners. 
The owners and chairmen of these clubs, who make up the board of the Super League, will reel in unprecedented prize money as a result of its creation. It makes sense — almost all of the most popular and most talented soccer teams in the world in one tournament, consistently putting the best against the best, giving everyone involved with the sport what they want to see regardless of who qualifies for what.
But when we read in between the lines of where this is heading, we can see some very troubling signs. Who’s going to watch Burnley play Everton in the Premier League on a Monday night when they can watch Inter Milan play Liverpool in the Super League?  
Even if the Super League members choose to and are allowed to remain in their domestic leagues, the quality of play will almost certainly diminish in the league. All eyes will be set on the Super League, where the glory and highest prize money will be up for grabs.
Why would Tottenham or Arsenal play their best team in a weekend Premier League game against Aston Villa when they’re playing FC Barcelona in the Super League midweek? 
The formation of the Super League is great for the clubs with a seat at the table. It’s catastrophically bad for everyone else. 
The founding clubs in the Super League will receive around $400 million for joining the competition, which is more than four times what Bayern Munich took home for winning the Champions League, Europe’s top prize in club soccer, last season. 
The Super League clubs, the commercial juggernauts of the sport, those with a strong global fan base and brand, will benefit from record prize money and increased exposure. We likely won’t ever see another run like Leicester City’s historic 2015 title run. The gap in resources and appeal between top clubs and mid-level clubs has been widening for a while, but this only puts the nail in the coffin.
