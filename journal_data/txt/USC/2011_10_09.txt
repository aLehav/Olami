At Sunday’s practice, junior transfer cornerback Isiah Wiley was the best player, per USC head coach Lane Kiffin.
“He was actually the MVP of the day,” Kiffin said of Wiley’s practice performance. “Maybe he’s one of those stories of a guy that pops up during a bye week and takes on the challenge of wanting to play, and earn himself some playing time, hopefully.”
Since he was a transfer, Wiley could not attend spring practice, making the already difficult transformation harder.
“It’s so hard transitioning, coming in without a spring for anybody,” Kiffin said. “Fortunately, he was here then he wasn’t here, so that’s a lot of time he would have had, and he’s had to play catch-up.”
“Isiah’s been playing good,” said junior safety T.J. McDonald. “You saw him today. He broke up a few passes and getting his hands on balls. He’s coming in — no dropoff for a guy who hasn’t been in that rotation for that long — and doing a good job.”

When preparing for Cal, Kiffin and the team take the Golden Bears’ last performance, against No. 9 Oregon, with a grain of salt.
“It doesn’t mean a whole lot to us. It’s such an abnormal system that Oregon runs on offense that a lot of time we don’t really use that film,” Kiffin said. “When people play Oregon, they play a completely different defense because it doesn’t resemble anything having to do with a pro-style system.”
Though freshman Oregon receiver De’Anthony Thomas burned Cal’s defense for 132 yards from scrimmage, sophomore wideout Robert Woods placed the prospect of playing the Golden Bears defense in perspective.
“That was Oregon’s offense, they play well. Hopefully, our offense can do the same thing, if not better,” Woods said. “We just got to play better, play in sync and put up great running yards and passing yards.”
On offense, Kiffin praised Cal receiving duo sophomore Keenan Allen and senior Marvin Jones.
“[Playing the receivers with a struggling secondary is] a huge challenge. Starting with Keenan, he makes every play. He’s fast; he’s big; he’s strong; possession receiver, deep receiver,” Kiffin said. “Unfortunately for us, we’re going to have another guy we’re really going to have to focus on.
“On [last Thursday’s Oregon vs. Cal] telecast, they called them the best duo receivers in the conference,” Kiffin added.
****
The USC football kicked off practice Sunday following a bye week, due to the team travelling to San Francisco to play California this Thursday.
“I really don’t know what day it is,” McDonald joked. “It feels good to sleep in — we’re usually up around six o’clock in the morning — so in that sense, it feels good.”
Though McDonald was on one end of the spectrum regarding Sunday practice, Woods discussed the matter more seriously.
“It was a little different. After a while, we got adjusted to it,” Woods said. “We know we had to be here. Practice starting picking up, and guys started making plays on both sides.”
****
Though both Woods (“Feeling pretty good, had a week off. I’m just trying to take care of my body still, be a hundred percent fast to fly around against Cal”) and McDonald (“It feels good. This is the best my body has felt in a long time, so I kind of think a lot of people can say the same thing”) recovered during the bye week, redshirt sophomore Torin Harris did not practice Sunday relating to a shoulder injury he sustained.

In any preseason tournament, wins and losses do not matter nearly as much as they will later in the season. The Women of Troy, however, suffered some tough losses at the Riviera Women’s All-American Tennis Championships from Oct. 1 through Oct. 9.
Junior Danielle Lao lost in the Round of 16 in the main draw singles bracket, dropping two out of three sets to Duke’s Beatrice Capra. After losing the first set 4-6, Lao rallied to take the second set 6-4 before ultimately falling short in the third set 2-6. Lao won her first match against Baylor’s Diana Nakic in quick fashion by a score of 6-2, 6-0.
The standout in the singles bracket, however, was freshman Zoe Scandalis. Making her collegiate debut, the San Diego native took on California’s Jana Juricova, the No. 1 player in the country, in the Round of 16 in the main draw singles bracket after defeating a slew of opponents in the prequalifying and qualifying brackets.
In the match, Juricova appeared to be on her way to an easy win over the freshman after taking the first set 6-2. But Scandalis rallied to win the second set 7-5 and the battle was on. The third set was a tight one that needed a tiebreaker to be decided. After jumping out to a 4-0 lead, Scandalis could not hold off the top-ranked Juricova and ultimately lost, 7-6.
On the doubles side of the bracket, sophomore Kaitlyn Christian was paired with freshman Sabrina Santamaria. The pair fared well in the qualifying stage, winning three straight matches. After a first round win in the main draw, however, the two stumbled against Sofie Oyen and Allie Will of Florida.
Freshman Gabriella DeSimone also paired with Scandalis in the doubles side of the bracket.  The freshman duo won its first two matches in the prequalifying stage but lost in the third round.
DeSimone and Santamaria also played in the singles tournament, falling during the prequalifying stage.
Christian lost in the third round of the qualifying stage to Florida’s Joanna Mather.
The Women of Troy play next at the ITA Southwest Regional Championships, beginning Oct. 21 in San Diego.
It is time for a new head coach after sixteen years with only one final four to show for all of the seasons. Think that is enough time to have accomplished a lot more in comparison to the men who have won three straight titles recently.

The quest for a national singles title fell short for three members of the No. 1 USC men’s tennis team at the International Tennis Association Men’s All-American Championships in Tulsa, Okla.
The last stand · No. 16 senior Daniel Nguyen, an All-Pac-10 Honorable Mention last season, advanced to the semifinals in his final appearance at the ITA All-American Championships in Tulsa, Okla., over the weekend. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
Though No. 15 sophomore Ray Sarmiento and freshman Yannick Hanfmann struggled in the weeklong competition, No. 16 senior Daniel Nguyen battled to the semifinals of the singles main draw before losing 6-4, 6-2 to freshman Mitchell Frank of Virginia on Saturday.
Playing four matches in three days, Nguyen had only lost a single set before his matchup against Frank, ranked No. 1 in the ITA Newcomers/Freshmen Rankings. The freshman also lost a single set before the semifinals, besting Ohio State’s No. 5 Chase Buchanan and Illinois’ No. 7 Dennis Nevolo.
Amid the windy conditions in Tulsa, Nguyen deciphered Frank’s defensive playing style after pulling ahead to take a 4-2 lead in the first set. Nguyen, however, slipped as Frank sent deeper balls into his territory to take him out of position.
The Virginia freshman would not look back, taking the first set and finishing the second with an ace to book a trip to the finals.
“Wind was definitely a factor, and [Frank’s] ability just to be really consistent wore me down physically,” Nguyen said. “He doesn’t miss a ball.”
Before the semifinals, Nguyen defeated Louisiana State’s No. 39 Neal Skupski, Washington’s No. 22 Kyle McMorrow, Vanderbilt’s No. 102 senior Charlie Jones and Texas A&M’s No. 42 Alexis Klegou.
“I think the key for Daniel was that he was really comfortable with himself out there,” USC coach Peter Smith said. “He’s a very good tennis player, and he really let that come out.”
Despite missing the finals by one match in his final year at the tournament, Nguyen leaves with an automatic berth in the USTA/ITA National Indoor Intercollegiate Championships in Flushing, N.Y., next month.
Though Nguyen found early tournament success, Sarmiento could not overcome a tough first-round matchup against No. 4 Henrique Cunha of Duke, losing 6-2, 6-2. His early loss sent him to the consolation bracket, where he defeated Georgia Tech’s No. 34 Juan Spir 7-6 (5), 6-2 and BYU’s No. 53 Patrick Kawka 6-4, 6-0 to reach the consolation quarterfinals.
Awaiting him was Pepperdine’s No. 10 junior Sebastian Fanselow, who took down Sarmiento 6-3, 6-2 to end his tournament run.
“[Ray] really had some good moments, but it wasn’t consistent enough,” Smith said.
Earlier in the week, Hanfmann participated in the qualifying singles draw, where he needed three consecutive victories to join his teammates in the main draw.
Hanfmann could only capture a 6-1, 6-3 victory over Florida State’s Cristian Gonzalez-Mendez before losing 3-6, 3-6 to Florida’s No. 58 Bob van Overbeek.
Next week, three other members of the team will have a shot at reeling in a singles title. No. 66 senior Emilio Gomez and freshmen Eric Johnson and Jonny Wang will travel to San Francisco from Thursday through Sunday to participate in the Battle in the Bay Classic.
Please clarify the class of Emilio Gomez who you repeatedly list as a senior while he is listed as a sophomore on the tennis roster after playing one season for the Trojans. What a difference between the two freshmen with Virginia’s  Mitchell Frank making the finals of the main draw and USC’s Yannick Hanfmann could only win one match in the qualifying round. Steve Johnson please return for your senior year!
Apologies, Gomez is indeed a sophomore. My mistake.

A trip north to the Bay Area did not cure the USC women’s soccer team’s woes, as the team’s record continues to head south.
The Women of Troy dropped their seventh and eight consecutive games, falling 3-0 to No. 1 Stanford on Friday and 2-0 to California on Sunday. USC is now 3-12 on the year and still searching for its first Pac-12 victory.
Searching for answers · USC coach Ali Khosroshahin is trying to find a solution for the team’s scoring issues this season. The Women of Troy were shut out by No. 1 Stanford and California over the weekend. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“We just haven’t played as well as we should be playing,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “We’re getting chances and not doing what we should be doing with them.”
The Golden Bears entered Sunday’s match on a four-game winless streak but looked impressive in USC’s second consecutive shutout loss.
“They took advantage of the shots they had, and we didn’t,” Khosroshahin said. “It’s really as simple as that.”
USC played Cal to a scoreless tie at halftime but was victimized by a pair of Golden Bear corner kicks in the second half. Cal forward Rachel Mercik broke the stalemate on a header in the 48th minute. Midfielder Taylor Comeau followed 10 minutes later with her first goal of the season from 25 yards out.
“We let them do what you can’t do, and that’s score of those corner kicks,” Khosroshahin said. “And then when you don’t respond with chances of your own it’s not going to turn out well.”
USC had its best chances in the 23rd minute, when back-to-back corner kicks resulted in shots on goal. Senior Brittany Kerridge’s boot to fellow senior Ashli Sandoval necessitated a save from sophomore goalkeeper Emily Kruger. Senior Claire Schloemer’s chance just seconds later sailed wide.
“[Brittany] Kerridge is playing very well, really giving us a chance on a lot of possessions,” Khosroshahin said. “It’s just too bad we aren’t playing like that all around.”
USC’s failure to score, a season-long issue, especially rankled Khosroshahin.
“This game is all about putting the ball in the back of the net,” Khosroshahin said. “You can talk about giving up goals, but that’s what it comes down to. We didn’t do that [against Cal].”
The undefeated Cardinal presented a rigorous test for USC, which had struggled scoring goals entering the weekend and failed to find the back of the net in both games.
Despite a career-high eight saves for sophomore goalkeeper Shelby Church and close shots from sophomore Elizabeth Eddy and senior Ashley Freyer, Stanford jumped out to a two-goal first-half lead and never looked back.
“They’re probably the best team we’ve played all year,” Khosroshahin said. “They played us as tough as we’ve ever been played.”
USC hung with the Cardinal until the 32nd minute, when forward Sydney Payne scored on a deflected header to give Stanford the lead. Minutes later, defender Rachel Quon booted the ball off the underside of the top post and in to extend the lead to 2-0.
Stanford added a third goal with just 30 seconds remaining to close out the scoring. The Cardinal’s shutout of the Women of Troy was just the latest in a streak of dominating efforts from Stanford’s defense. The victory over USC gave the Cardinal a streak of seven straight shutouts, a run that came to an end Sunday in a 4-1 win over UCLA.
“We knew they’d be great going in,” Khosroshahin said. “No surprise there.”
The Women of Troy will finish up their three-game road trip Friday against Washington before returning to McAlister Field for their last home stand of the season.
Completely agree with Steve B. Definitely time for a change at the top.
The Coach is showing his true ability to recruit now after somehow winning a national title with the previous coach’s players. His demeanor worked right at the start presently is getting tiresome to the young ladies. He had a chance to build a solid program with the initial success and has gone the other way, time for a change at the top.
Wow. Talk about getting into a downward spiral. Why doesn’t  he move Autumn back to playing forward so that there are more goal scoring opportunities??  His job better be on the line. What a disastrous season.

For the first time since its national title season in 2003, the USC women’s volleyball team  is riding an eight-game win streak after taking down Arizona and Arizona State.
Formidable · Senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter finished with a team-high 15 kills in the Women of Troy’s four-set win at Arizona State. - Olivia Garcia | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy’s (13-3, 8-1) matchup in Tempe, Ariz., proved to be a tough test for coach Mick Haley’s squad as it faced off against a gritty Arizona State team Saturday.
“Arizona State beat us there last year and they play well against us at home,” Haley said. “Through the course of the last seven or eight years, we’ve went to five games and they seem to always play hard against us.”
Though sitting in 11th place in the Pac-12, the Sun Devils (4-13, 0-8) tested USC, taking the match to four sets and snapping the Women of Troy’s streak of seven straight sweeps.
Arizona State’s outside hitter Ashley Kastl kept the Sun Devils close, with a match-leading 23 kills, including the game-winning kill that ended the first set.
Despite trailing early, the Women of Troy finished the match strong, winning the final three games (22-25, 25-17, 25-20, 29-27), which included a fourth-set barnburner that ended on a Hannah Schraer kill and a Sun Devil hitting mistake.
Though Arizona State’s setter Shannon McCready had 51 assists on the day, senior setter Kendall Bateman outdid her counterpart, notching 60 assists. Bateman now has a Pac-12-leading 11.91 assists per set.
“Kendall had a great weekend,” Haley said. “Traveling two weekends in a row takes its toll and I’m pleased we were able to weather that.”
Unusually savvy at the net, the Women of Troy turned in their best defensive performance of the year as the team combined for 13 blocks during the match.
“We were very good up at the net, but the problem was they had the 12 blocks against us,” Haley said. “Our hitting just wasn’t very good and [hitting and blocking] are supposed to happen at the same time.”
Williams, who registered 23 kills and eight blocks this weekend, has become an unstoppable force in the middle these last few weeks and her season-high seven blocks against the Sun Devils set the tone defensively.
“We expected Williams to be like this,” Haley said. “She’s focused and the better she gets in the middle, the easier it will be for our outside hitters. I think she’s continuing to work hard and as defenses are starting to game plan around her, we’ll get stronger as a team.”
Alongside Williams, sophomore libero Natalie Hagglund set a career high with 33 digs against the Sun Devils.
Led by senior All-American middle blocker Lauren Williams and her Pac-12-leading .422 hitting percentage, USC made easy work of Arizona (11-6, 3-5) sweeping the Wildcats in Tucson, Ariz., on Friday.
Recording their seventh straight sweep (27-25, 25-21, 25-19), the Women of Troy received 16 kills from senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter, and as a team topped hitting percentages of more than .400 in the second and third sets.
Freshman middle blocker Hannah Schraer got another start opposite Williams in the middle for USC, and once again she made the most of her efforts, recording six kills on a .714 hitting percentage, nudging her season total just over .400.
Schraer and sophomore outside hitter Katie Fuller both reached double-digit kills against Arizona State and the duo set season highs in blocks on Saturday as well.
After recording season highs against Arizona State with 66 kills and 13 blocks, the Women of Troy return home to take on Oregon and Oregon State this weekend.

I have always felt it is hard to determine the value of a college football program. Unlike, say, for a professional baseball team, Forbes doesn’t annually list the monetary value of Florida, Texas or USC. There isn’t an established market price. There isn’t an exact figure that can be attached.
There are a few things, however, that might indicate at least some significance: TV deals, Nielsen ratings and attendance numbers. All small samples, sure, but something to work off of, at least in looking to estimate a program’s worth.
Based on attendance, all signs would appear to indicate the USC brand has taken somewhat of a hit in recent months. In its most recent game, a 48-41 win over Arizona, attendance was listed at 63,707 — the lowest since 2002.
In several respects, it’s representative of a scandal-plagued 16-month stint for a program that has all so suddenly taken a turn for the worse.
Yet, with this week marking the one-year anniversary of the inauguration of C. L. Max Nikias as USC’s 11th president, it begs the question: Why has the new administration been largely silent in regard to football?
Historically and culturally at USC, football is king. Nothing in that is surprising. Nothing in that is at all groundbreaking. It’s largely and commonly accepted.
Based on the current state of affairs, however, fans are frustrated — not necessarily with any individual or organization but simply with the current predicament: four years probation.
They are frustrated with losing — six losses in two years. They are frustrated with a cultural change. Perhaps, more than anything, they are frustrated with the restrictions, a postseason ban and scholarship reductions that have been placed on a beloved football team. Restrictions that, despite other similarly alleged NCAA violations nationwide, have yet to be imposed upon any other program.
Oddly, Nikias has largely failed to, at the very least, address the elephant in the room that is football and sympathize with an increasingly irritated fanbase.
To the best of my knowledge, he has publicly spoken about the football program on just two occasions. The first came after the school’s appeal of sanctions to the NCAA last January when he thanked the appeals committee for a “fair” proceeding. The second came in August when the university said it would not pursue any further recourse against the NCAA.
Neither statement exactly warmed the hearts of alumni scattered throughout Southern California and across the globe.
Granted, it doesn’t fall high up on the to-do list of a president at a top-25 university to pay lip service to the football program, but for something so important to so many alumni, students and others living within the metro complex of Los Angeles, remaining mute in this regard is inadequate.
It is certainly a sensitive time. It’s a unique situation. Nothing has gone right. USC was arguably the king of college football from 2002 to 2008, and, whether right or wrong, that is the expectation.
Moving forward, Nikias can’t be silent in this front. He’s indicated that the success of football is important to some degree in regard to the university’s goals over the coming decade.
His silence, however, would indicate indifference, and no matter how many billions he raises — USC announced a $6-billion fundraising campaign in August — fans want to know where football fits into the larger equation.
“All this is the great adventure,” Nikias said during his inauguration speech last October. “All this is the great journey. All this is the way forward to the destined reign of Troy.”
Fans are begging to know: Is football a part of that “destined” reign of Troy?
The thing about football is that it’s tangible.
Nikias can put billions of dollars into various academic programs, but for a majority of alumni, parents and others living in the South Los Angeles community, they don’t necessarily experience that. They get to experience football — six to seven times a year at the Coliseum.
They don’t get to sit in an engineering lab. They don’t get to undertake research. They don’t get to listen to a guest lecture from a doctor with a Ph.D.
They, for a select number of days, get to watch Matt Barkley throw touchdown passes to Robert Woods.
Maybe Nikias has entrusted new athletic director Pat Haden with carrying out football’s PR campaign moving forward, and that’s fine. But to put it lightly: That’s not enough.
Both Nikias and Provost Elizabeth Garrett were incredibly proactive in the addition of women’s lacrosse. They lobbied heavily for it and got sponsorship within months. They’ve demonstrated they care about collegiate athletics.
That’s not necessarily a point of contention.
Football at USC is the breadwinner in every sense of the word. It’s been that way since Howard Jones coached here in the 1920s. USC wins and it wins at football, plain and simple.
Outside circumstances, though, have changed in this regard. The times are different. Things aren’t exactly the same.
But as Nikias heads this leg of the race, he’s long overdue for at least acknowledging where football fits in.

“Nikias can put billions of dollars into various academic programs, but for a majority of alumni, parents and others living in the South Los Angeles community, they don’t necessarily experience that. They get to experience football — six to seven times a year at the Coliseum.
They don’t get to sit in an engineering lab. They don’t get to undertake research. They don’t get to listen to a guest lecture from a doctor with a Ph.D.
They, for a select number of days, get to watch Matt Barkley throw touchdown passes to Robert Woods.”
No, for only the minority of alumni that are sports fans are these things true. For a majority of alumni, having USC be a top institution in its fields adds value to their degree and also adds talented people to the workforce. Matt Barkley and Robert Woods play catch, while the people getting the attention help society.
Play catch or help society? Tough decision.

For a team that prides itself on matching its offensive firepower with its defensive prowess, Saturday’s nonconference matchup with No. 12 Loyola Marymount at McDonald’s Swim Stadium exemplified the effort the No. 4 USC men’s water polo team will need to reclaim its previous position atop the water polo food chain.
Balanced attack · Sophomore utility Mace Rapsey was one of 10 Trojans to notch at least one goal on Saturday against No. 12 Loyola Marymount. Rapsey’s third-quarter goal was a part of a 9-0 run that powered USC to an 11-1 lead and eventual 11th victory of the season. - Ali Kolangian | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (11-2, 2-0) topped LMU 13-3, receiving scoring contributions from 10 different players, including a hat trick from freshman driver Kostas Genidounias and two goals from senior driver Peter Kurzeka.
But the prolific scoring output overshadowed what was arguably the most impressive element of the Trojans’ well-rounded performance: their impenetrable defense.
“Whenever you lose, you have a tendency to re-evaluate everything,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “I think the biggest thing is that, in the two games we lost, we gave up 11 natural [even-strength] goals. Our philosophy is not to give up any natural goals. That was a problem in the SoCal tournament.”
In Saturday’s game, all three goals USC relinquished were scored on exclusion penalties. In the first quarter USC’s defense forced turnovers on six of LMU’s nine possessions.
At one point in the third quarter, LMU’s offense could not muster a single shot on USC senior goalie Joel Dennerley for eight consecutive possessions. Throughout the match, Trojan defenders managed to extend their arms in shooting lanes, thus amassing an embarrassment of field blocks.
“We were able to put in a couple of goals early,” Kurzeka said. “We came out strong and did a nice job with the counterattack. It was great defensive effort — a lot like our game on Thursday — and that’s what we need coming off a tough stretch like we did.”
Though USC jumped out to an early lead and notched 13 goals, Vavic and Kurzeka are still dissatisfied with the offense as of late, insisting USC has failed to bear down and capitalize on some of its easier scoring chances. The Trojans know such opportunities will be at a premium when they face perennial powerhouses such as Stanford, California and UCLA.
“We missed probably five wide-open shots today, where we hit the post, shot it wide or shot it right at the goalie,” Vavic said. “We were up 2-0 after the first quarter with a lot of missed opportunities, and then they scored to open up the second quarter. So now, instead of being up 4-0 or 5-0, you’re in a brawl.”
Though the Lions were within striking distance of the Trojans, USC’s offense figured to be too much. Sophomore two-meter Connor Virjee, who scored 22 goals last season as a true freshman, is beginning to heat up as, for the second consecutive game, he rifled an awe-inducing, long-distance shot for his third goal of the season. Redshirt freshman two-meter A.J. MacDonell tallied the final goal of the game for his fourth of the season.
“At the beginning, usually we try to give our younger players a lot of playing time,” Vavic said. “Then, some of the guys earn more playing time and other guys lose it. This year a lot of the younger guys are showing that they can play. [Redshirt freshman two-meter] Jack Plaga, obviously [Genidounias] is doing a good job, [freshman driver] Marc Vonderweidt. Some players who didn’t play much last year are really showing us their ability.”
USC heads to Berkeley, Calif., to face No. 2 California Saturday.

Bernard G. Slavin, a forensic anatomy expert and associate professor of gross anatomy and histology at the USC Keck School of Medicine, died Saturday of complications from advanced prostate cancer. He was 74.

Slavin was a lecturer for the biological systems course at  the Keck School of Medicine and had taught at the university for 36 years. He attended UC Berkeley for his undergraduate education and received his master’s and doctorate degrees in human anatomy from UC San Francisco.
At Keck, Slavin was an instructor in surgical anatomy for orthopedic, radiology and internal organ injuries.
In addition to his work at Keck, Slavin used his expertise in human anatomy to provide testimony in court for law firms as an expert witness.
Curtis Okamoto, associate professor of pharmacology and pharmaceutical sciences who taught alongside Slavin, said Slavin was highly regarded as a professor.
“[Slavin] was well-liked and well-respected by all the students in the courses he taught,” Okamoto said.  “Every student regarded him as a very intelligent and knowledgeable person.”
Richard Dang, a third-year student in the School of Pharmacy, and the president of the Associated Students of the School of Pharmacy, also remembers Slavin as a very passionate teacher.
“Dr. Slavin lectured the biological systems course that all pharmacy students have to take during their first year, and [many students] considered it the highlight of [their] first year,” Dang said. “The course he taught was very difficult, but he taught in a way that we could easily understand.”
Dang also said Slavin’s reputation for outstanding teaching was renowned throughout the School of Pharmacy.
“Each year, the School of Pharmacy awards one professor the award of Professor of the Year,” Dang said. “Dr. Slavin was consistently nominated because he was so well-liked by all the students.”
Correction: Dr. Slavin taught the Biological Systems course in the School of Pharmacy not the Keck School of Medicine, where he taught the Gross Anatomy course

Students who typically fly home for the holidays are expressing frustration over increasing airfare costs and additional fees.
Since last March, airfare prices for most U.S. carriers have increased between $10 and $60. In an effort to prevent ticket prices from increasing further, airlines are finding other ways to create revenue.
Airlines have begun imposing extra fees on heavy-packing fliers, among other efforts to increase revenue.
Continental Airlines and United Airlines now charge $400 for bags weighing 71 to 100 pounds for many international flights, while American Airlines charges $450 for overweight bags on its Asian-bound flights. For the first checked bag, Continental, American and United charge $25, and the fees increase to up to $200 by the third bag. These fees can be especially burdensome on college students with tight budgets.
“I don’t think it’s that airlines are specifically targeting students, but it does turn out that way,” said Erica Zara, a junior majoring in psychology. “They’re trying to squeeze every dollar out of you that they can.”
Zara said she flies back home to Las Vegas six to seven times a year.
“I try to carry less bags, but if I’m going on a long trip, then I’ll wind up still paying for it,” Zara said. “What else can you do? Fuel costs are rising, and the economy is bad. It’s a tough time for everyone.”
USC alumnus and transportation expert Alan Huynh, however, attributes the increased prices and the future rise in airfare to federal regulations.
“Fees have increased because of different federal regulations imposed on airports,” Huynh said. “That is why they charge you $25 these days to carry on an extra item.”
Any future tax increase will also affect the price of airplane tickets.
“The corporate taxes will affect ticket prices,” Huynh said. “The airlines are businesses. These big businesses will be paying more taxes. They will pass those costs to customers.”
Airlines were also hit hard by the closure of non-essential government services this summer.
“A big thing that happened this summer is that the [Federal Aviation Administration] shut down,” Huynh said. “The federal government loses money whenever there is a federal shut-down, but there is more of an impact in that the government loses a billion dollars in ticket fees.”
Though Huynh said he does not believe the government shut-down this summer is currently affecting ticket fees, which means taxes will only continue to increase.
With the increased prices, students said they are doing all they can to cut back and get around the hidden fees.
Zara said she has since switched from flying Spirit to Southwest because of bag fees. While Spirit charges $38 to $50 for the first checked bag and $45 to $50 for the second bag, Southwest does not impose any fees for the first two checked bags.
Other students said they agree increased prices will play a role in what airline they choose.
Thalia Ertman, a sophomore majoring in history and East Asian languages and cultures, said she looked for the lowest price when buying a ticket to fly home to Potomac, Md., for Thanksgiving this year.
“I always try to find the cheapest flight there is when I go,” Ertman said. “I make sure to search around.”
Some students said the increased fees also change the way they travel.
“There have been times when I have made sure to carry on because they charge you all these ridiculous fees,” said Lydia Froemelt, a senior majoring in engineering management and industrial and systems engineering. “I try to choose airlines where you don’t have to deal with those extra charges.”
Huynh said Southwest has been able to keep its prices down because of efficiency.
“For Southwest, they are probably just eating the cost,” Huynh said. “They did all these things to cut costs off. They use a certain kind of airplane that is a more efficient airplane. They did that before everyone else figured it out.”
But for most students traveling out-of-state, the costs are a burden. Flying is inevitable and students will pay what they have to in order to go home.
“I only go home for Thanksgiving and Christmas,” Froemelt said. “I pay whatever I have to because that’s the only time I see my family.”

For the next 10 days, more than 200 USC students will drink only tap water as they participate in the Wells Project.
The money saved from not drinking other beverages will be donated to Rwandan communities to provide clean, safe water through Living Water International.

The Wells Project, founded at Texas A&M University in 2007, was created to give college students an opportunity to improve the water crisis in Africa. The Wells Project has since partnered with Living Water International, an organization founded in 1990 devoted to providing potable water sources to African villages; the organization has established 30 chapters at universities throughout the nation.
Lindsey Caldwell, co-founder of USC’s Well Project, said USC’s chapter’s goal is to involve the entire campus in the 10-day event.
“We all agreed we wanted the Wells Project to unite the campus, not segregate or become an exclusive organization,” Caldwell said in an email. “As we are starting out, we have everyone from engineering students to Greek students to athletes.”
Different chapters each made a video to promote the project this year, and junior quarterback Matt Barkley represented USC.
USC Wells Project has set a goal of raising $10,000 this year, and 100 percent of funds will go toward the construction of wells in Rwanda.
Living Water International will drill wells in Rwanda with the funds raised and participants will receive a Wells Report that includes pictures and statistical information about the wells. The report will include coordinates so that participants can view the well through Google Earth.
Caldwell said she founded the USC chapter of Wells Project after hearing about the program’s successes elsewhere and decided to bring the project to USC to raise awareness of the international water shortage and provide a platform for students to help solve the problem.
“I heard about the camaraderie it brought to the campus and the sheer joy the members had when they reached their fundraising goals,” Caldwell said. “I wanted that for USC. I wanted students to feel like they were making a difference, [and could] unite campus and help change the world.”
Lainey Barkley, a sophomore majoring in human performance and a participant in the project, said she chose to take part in the Wells Project because it helps solve a severe global issue.
“By giving up something that is not a necessity in my life, I am being a part of bringing a necessity to someone else,” Barkley said. “It is also a good reminder, each time I deny myself a drink I want, that I have been given all I need and have everything to be grateful for.”
Heidi Ippolito, a senior majoring in cinema television and critical studies and a project participant, said it will be difficult to give up other beverages, but she is confident the project will have a positive impact on her life.
“Missing my daily coffee and tea will certainly be a challenge, but it is a challenge that I hope will remind me of my own blessings,” Ippolito said.
The Wells Project will set up information tables on Trousdale Parkway today and Wednesday. Participants will be selling shirts and food items and giving away wristbands and fliers. Participants also plan to raise awareness by carrying five-gallon jugs in a water walk from the Finger Fountain to the statue of Traveler.
This is beautiful and I hope this becomes a trend among other schools :)

People and Things by Jack’s Mannequin
2/4 Stars
Released Oct. 4, People and Things is the third album from Orange County-based piano-rock/pop/punk group Jack’s Mannequin.  In order to understand People and Things, we must first examine the journey of frontman Andrew McMahon.
In 2005, shortly after the release of the band’s first album, McMahon was diagnosed with leukemia. That album, Everything in Transit, is a sunny, Beach Boys-esque album about love and heartbreak. In 2007, The Glass Passenger was released — an emotionally intense, intimate album, with many songs clearly influenced by McMahon’s battle with cancer.
People and Things is an attempted fusion of these two musical albums. McMahon calls People and Things “the finishing of a three-record installation.” The album is not falling in love, but it’s not just about despair — McMahon says that it focuses on “the stuff in between.”
While many bands have alienated their audience by breaking out into a completely new sound, Jack’s Mannequin’s fans shouldn’t see any surprises here. However, this is precisely the problem with People and Things — it’s nothing new. The album is saturated with radio-friendly songs that seem to have lost some of the magic of the old Jack’s Mannequin.
The albums opening track and a single, “My Racing Thoughts,” is a synth-based track about relationships. The synthesizer sounds horribly out of place for Jack’s Mannequin, and almost cheesy. The best parts of the track are when the synthesizer isn’t playing—some nice piano riffs create some nice bridges within the song, but overall it falls short.
The other single for People and Things is “Amy, I.”  This track starts out promisingly, but settles for a disappointing, poppy chorus. McMahon sings in the chorus, “Amy I / may never feel this way again / I never felt this kind of cold.”  Vocally, McMahon seems to be losing his unique sound — some of his vocal flourishes remind one of Gavin DeGraw or even U2.
While Andrew McMahon has called the new album “a pretty true rock ‘n’ roll record,” this is precisely what’s wrong with the album. A new Motley Crue / U2 –esque twist on the band’s sound has pushed the band more toward a generic pop sound. The punk sound is gone, and the McMahon’s melodies seem less unique and catchy than before.
Lyrically, these tracks are full of gems but also miscues. In “Television,” one line disappointingly reads “You and I, baby, we’re a broken record,” but another line is the more intriguing “We’re making sound, but only for the noise,” depicting the aftermath of a fight.
Long-time Jack’s Mannequin fans will also certainly be disappointed by a lack of familiar, piano-heavy tracks.
Of note on the album is the track “Restless Dreams” — the first purely-acoustic song by the band. This track seems stuck somewhere between a lullaby and a Sheryl Crow ballad.
“Hey Hey Hey (We’re All Gonna Die)” is a nod to “Piano Man” by Billy Joel. This track seems to fill the obligatory somewhat-depressing anthem song that many pop rock bands try to fit into their album. “No Man Is an Island,” while somewhat cheesy, is an irresistibly sweet ballad about the love of a man for a woman. “Broken Bird” seems to lead us more back toward the Jack’s Mannequin of old — it’s more piano-based and fresher lyrically.
Although many might enjoy the more radio-friendly Jack’s Mannequin, the band seems to have left behind that made it most unique — the edge has been lost somewhere in the poppy melodies and the U2 / Motley Crue spin. An uninteresting fusion of their first two albums, People and Things is a disappointing album.
 
Classic example of a sub-professional reviewing an album.  This may be one of the most biased-infused reviews I’ve ever read.

Until about two weeks ago, USC  Hospitality seemed to move the USC green initiative a step further. The efforts in question were extended to USC dining halls — Parkside Restaurant College and Everybody’s Kitchen. The dining halls replaced traditionally ceramic utensils with recyclable ones, an effort that, although well intended, was not sustained longer than a week or so.
The new utensils, though environmentally friendly, were not user-friendly. They were flimsy and hard to use. And just as suddenly as these changes were implemented, they were retracted.
Though the initiative seemed to be a move toward greener dining halls, it did not have the desired effect.
Economically and environmentally speaking, this action was more wasteful than USC’s previous utensil use. Buying utensils on a regular basis is not only costly but it increases a need for recycling. Compared with the previous costs of detergent and a few replacements for damaged utensils, these new costs outweighed the old.
Yet this was a realization USC Hospitality came to only after it had implemented its new initiative.
USC already has green dining hall policies, but they could use some improvement. Among other things, the dining halls participate in 100 percent grease recycling, post-consumer food waste recycling and use of recycled paper products.
USC Hospitality also supports the local community by buying 6 percent of its food and beverage products from local producers and donating unused prepared food to the Los Angeles mission. In terms of promoting healthier food options, the dining halls’ V2O Organics Program provides vegan, vegetarian and organic food options for diners.
Though these practices are commendable, they hardly measure up to some of the policies  USC’s East Coast counterparts are implementing.
One of the best examples is Yale University. Yale ensures 40 percent of its total food purchases meet at least one of four sustainability criteria: local, eco-sensitive, humane and fair. USC’s 6 percent local food purchases look shoddy by comparison.
Yale is also currently working toward the goal of reducing its pre-and post-consumer solid waste produced in dining halls by 30 percent of its 2009 levels by June 30, 2013.
Yale also decided to reduce the number of required truck deliveries and make bulk purchases through consolidation.
USC currently has all of the resources it requires to make the move toward greener dining. We have access to a local community that can fulfill most of — if not all — our food needs, access to research and technology that can better help us devise environmentally friendly disposal methods, the required funding to implement green measures and an eager and cooperative student body that would gladly take up the cause.
We also have a mayor whose goals include making Los Angeles one of the greenest cities in the United States.
Though USC’s recent initiative was a definite step in the right direction, it would have been more effective had the university gone about it in the right way. There are greater and more effective changes that the administration can make in terms of green dining, and it would do well to learn from other institutions that have already exhibited success in this arena.

Amazing article!!!
I hope we do implement the necessary measures to provide greener dining halls. Fight On!
sounds like somebody wanted to go to yale…

From the most trivial of issues (who went to what party this weekend?) to the most traditional of society’s establishments (newspapers, music and book industries, Postal Service), Internet has transformed our lives. But one area remains to be revolutionized digitally: education.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
Online education is on the rise, pitting those who support the idea of a virtual university for its ability to increase access and revenue against those who believe there is no substitute for real-time, traditional educational experiences.
There’s one thing wrong with the entire conversation, however: Viewing online education as a new higher education business model that must supplant the current system is a close-minded view. Why not look at it as a means by which we can strengthen and innovate education by blending digital and traditional elements?
Online education began mostly as distance-learning programs for graduate degrees that lend themselves to the medium like engineering or business.
USC’s Viterbi School of Engineering has a well-established Distance Education Network that offers more than 30 master’s degree programs.
Now, in times of financial crisis, schools across the country, especially in California, are searching for ways to reinvent themselves. This has led to an expansion of digital courses into the undergraduate sphere.
But there is a distinct danger in allowing finance-driven ideas to dominate the dialogue about schools’ futures and education in general, especially for undergraduates whose educational experiences and life tracks are so defined by their first four years on a campus.
This is not to say that universities should completely reject online learning. It’s great to be able to listen to lectures at home or gain access to classes you can’t physically attend or afford.
Higher learning, however, is about a level of personal interaction and commitment that can’t be recreated online.
Before transferring to USC, I spent a semester at the University of San Francisco, where I took a hybrid service-learning Spanish class. It combined conventional in-class instruction twice a week with a once-a-week class online with Blackboard, in addition to a requirement of outside community service hours.
This kind of blending shows the innovative potential universities should recognize and seize. The idea of a virtual university should not replace the traditional, but instead should merge with it.
For undergraduates, hybrid classes could be incredibly valuable and much more engaging for a generation that spends so much time online.
Some of the University of California schools have submitted courses in response to an online education pilot project proposed by the University’s Office of the President.
Sebastian Thrun, a professor at Stanford University renowned for leading the team that built Google’s self-driving car, now offers a free online course, “Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.” Enrollment in this class has jumped from 58,000 to 130,000 across the world in the past month, according to The New York Times. USC is lucky enough to have generous alumni that keep it more than afloat financially. But as many universities choose to go digital, USC might want to follow suit.
The potential of all things online is vast. And there’s no match for the value of real-time, person-to-person educational experiences.
There’s no reason universities can’t take advantage of both.

Course Instructor Sebastian Thrun’s and Google’s Eric Schmidt’s reputations are built upon crimes, conspiracies and censorship of my speech to the public. Their cowardice reaction to my public challenge indicates they are guilty from inside their heart.
Before this case could be clarified, Course Instructor Sebastian Thrun’s name is not clear in these crimes which had cost human lives. Sebastian Thrun dare not deny anything I said.
When Eric Schmidt was in control of Google, he had abused google resource to support a criminal suspect Gabriele Scheler to cover up her crimes in name of Stanford Computer Science Department. and the complication from Gabriele Scheler’s case had get Stanford Computer Science professor Sebastian Thrun into Gabriele Scheler’s criminal case. Eric Schmidt had abused his power and google resources to support Gabriele Scheler’s false accusation of sexual assault on me and to support Sebastian Thrun’s unruly behaviors in Stanford, which had escaladed the complication in this case again and again, and which had led to Stanford student May Zhou’s death, a murder of an innocent Stanford student by Eric Schmidt,Sebasitan and Gabriele Scheler’s side; and later during their fight against ruling from U.S. authorities, Eric Schmidt, Sebastian Thrun and Gabriele Scheler’s side had plotted a murder on me as well. – See if they dare deny these facts in my public challenge here.
These unbelievable happenings are real and so far I am still waiting to see if Eric Schmidt and Sebastian Thrun could show facts to contradict my saying, or clearly deny any of my accusations against them, remember, those are crimes that had cost human life.

In the center of a crowd, it’s hard to decipher the scale of everything going on around you.
Exhilirating DJ · Tiësto wraps up his “College Life Tour” at the Home Depot with stunning music, brilliant stage displays and frenetic fireworks. - Photo courtesy of Rephlektor Inkorporated
For Tiesto’s final “College Life Tour” show at the Home Depot Center last Saturday, it took a look back from the stairs for the magnitude of the event to register: an entire soccer field filled to the brim with thousands of people, jumping up and down in frenetic ecstasy, hands flying, chests heaving in the cool autumn air.
The show didn’t begin that way. Nineteen-year-old electronic prodigy Porter Robinson kicked off the concert, and for all his exceptional skill, he still wasn’t able to muster up a big crowd.
That wasn’t necessarily his fault — it was early, the sun still hung in the sky and concertgoers were still trickling onto the hard white plastic floor of the stadium.
Regardless, he put on an impressive performance, weaving together his own tracks with crowd favorites such as the booming, dark Chuckie and Hardwell single “Move It 2 The Drum,” which elicited a roar of approval from the crowd.
Robinson showed his age and playfulness in the performance as well, deliberately milking the build-up to a song’s climax and mixing angular, unpredictable transitions from song to song — during his hit “Say My Name,” for instance, he left the crowd hanging in white noise for a moment before finally dropping the beat, laughing at everyone’s mistimed dancing.
Swedish duo Dada Life (Olle Corneer and Stefan Engblom) bumped up the volume, literally, and also benefitted from the help of a larger, more energetic audience that had finally established itself.
The duo pumped out a blend of eclectic house music. Highlights included mixes of Benny Benassi’s always-loved “Satisfaction,” the Lil’ Jon-infused, hard-hitting “Turbulence” and a breathtaking rendition of Swedish House Mafia’s “Save the World,” which inspired the audience to belt out the chorus in unison.
Of course, Dada Life wouldn’t be complete without two things: bananas and champagne. This random gimmick was executed in full force Saturday, with people in banana suits charging the stage and throwing out huge inflatables in the shape of — you guessed it — bananas and champagne. Corneer and Engblom also took the time to partake in a little real-world fruit and alcohol, wide smiles blooming on their faces.
Diplo (aka Thomas Pentz) continued the weirdness with his use of the gargantuan LED light board situated center stage, unleashing his signature psychedelic graphics onto the audience. His performance begged one serious question: Is there anything better than being fully entranced by bits of clip art dancing across an epileptically flashing red-and-green background, with Diplo’s acclaimed mixes blasting through a stadium?
The answer would be no — Diplo gave a show that made the crowd absolutely riotous as it never had been before. Behind a mash of grimy dubstep bass wobbles, screeching digital noise and reverberating synth chords, he fully demonstrated his honed skills in the process, giving Tiësto an extremely difficult act to follow. The inclusion of heart-stoppingly epic remixes of Kanye West’s “All Of The Lights” and Chris Brown’s tongue-twisting, swag-laced “Look At Me Now” topped off an entirely incredible display of aural and visual talent.
And like that, it was finally time for the headliner: Tiësto.
There was a quiet moment for a second. A cooling breeze meandered through the chattering crowd, folding in with the haze of marijuana smoke and the crowd’s palpable anticipation.
The quiet was broken by the brilliantly colorful light bursting from an array of enormous light boards saved for the final performance. The immensely theatrical video intro signaled Tiësto’s entrance, sending the crowd in a wild fit of eager animation. As a surprising burst of smoke and a pop of streamers soared into the front of the crowd, he was off.
“Theatrical” really was the operative word for the performance. Markedly different from Diplo’s eclectic, dynamically crazy style, Tiësto proved to be the right artist to close the night, smoothly shooting out track after track of spine-tingling trance and house blends — some songs more orchestral and other pieces just down-and-dirty, with bass that unloaded shockwaves through the writhing crowd.
The audience went crazy during this time, too. Everyone was moving: some jumping up and down, fists pumping, and others cruising in the zone, snaking their arms and legs to the rhythm. Water (or was that beer?) of unknown provenance showered down at random moments. And of course, there was the obligatory exposing of breasts, always accompanied by approving laughs and yells.
The performance also featured awe-inspiring pyrotechnics of various sorts — sometimes sparks sprayed around the stage, other times rockets of light streaked straight into the sky.
And that’s exactly how the show ended — with an extended spray of fireworks exploding in the night, the final gorgeous hits of Tiësto’s music fading away. The lights came up, and the crowd filed out of the Home Depot Center awash in the fog of pyrotechnic smoke, clumsily rolled blunts and countless menthol cigarettes, confetti shedding off of shoulders and hair, tired hands rubbing dilated pupils away.
Just one night, one stadium and one incredible collaboration between some of the world’s finest DJs.

If there’s ever a place that best defines the spirit of Los Angeles, it’s not the glitzy Hollywood theaters, the pale sands of Venice Beach or the celebrity mansions in Beverly Hills.
Cultural eats · Boyle Heights, known for its rich blend of cultural history and food — including Jewish, Japanese and Latino eateries — is still home to a delectable assortment of restaurants, such as Otomisan and Guisados Tacos. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan 
It’s Boyle Heights, a not-so-quiet neighborhood teeming with rich cultural history and food — everything from Jewish delis to Japanese izakayas and Mexican restaurants.
Once a sparse piece of muddy land, this 6.5-square-mile area on the east bank of the Los Angeles River became the Jewish center of Los Angeles in the ’20s.
Boyle Heights’ rudimentary streets were lined with Kosher delis and markets selling lox and hearty rye bread, and bar mitzvahs filled synagogues and community centers with plenty of festive noises.
The original location of Canters Deli, famed for its fist-sized matzo balls and pastrami sandwiches, was in Boyle Heights until it moved to the Fairfax District with most of the Jewish community. Left today are just a sprinkling of old Jewish folks and a faded shul on Breed Street.
As the Jewish population dispersed in droves, Boyle Heights saw an influx of Japanese Americans who flooded into the east downtown area to escape real estate issues and racial discrimination.
These Japanese newcomers found a place where they could dine in public and integrate comfortably into the community in Boyle Heights.
One restaurant called Otomisan still remains exactly the way it was 55 years ago.
Inconspicuously stitched into the corner of a street dotted with al pastor taquerías and Latino insurance businesses, this home-style mom-and-pop diner is a curious blend of a ’50s ice cream parlor and an izakaya (Japanese drinking establishment).
The antiquated décor — brightly painted Japanese masks and lucky cat statues of all sizes — is worn and dusty, and the dining area is cramped with three booths and five bar stools. The customers are a mix of old Japanese regulars and curious Latino neighbors who don’t mind the longer wait, especially when the cook’s toddler son patters out to serve hot tea.
Otomisan’s menu is simple with basic home-style cooking like oyako-don (steamed rice bowl topped with tender chicken and a blanket of velvety, barely-cooked egg) and sukiyaki (beef slices, vegetables and udon noodles dipped into sweet soy sauce-based broth). All dishes are homemade and fresh; pork dumplings are hand-pleated and steam-fried, shrimp tempura is lightly battered and crisp-fried on the spot and everything tastes wholesome, domestic and delicious.
Though Boyle Heights doesn’t have the esteemed culinary reputation of Culver City or Santa Monica, it’s actually home to some of the best Mexican fare in Los Angeles.
Hole-in-the-wall restaurants with wall-painted signs sell all sorts of non-Americanized antojitos (informal Mexican street food) on every street, and jubilant Mexican music streams out from the plentiful take-out counters late into the night.
Guisados Tacos on E. Cesar Chavez Avenue is one of the newer and more popular places for its guisados — slow-braised meats and simmering stews served on hand-pressed tortillas. The menu focuses mainly on the braised toppings and changes periodically, but popular options like chicharron (crackly pork rinds soaked in zesty salsa verde) and tinga de pollo (spicy, smoky chicken stewed with cabbage, chorizo and chipotle and topped with slices of raw onion and avocado) are indispensable for good reason.
Down the same street is the more historical Antojitos Carmen, a street vendor turned brick-and-mortar. Once a hot-selling cart at the now-shuttered Breed Street food fair for more than 20 years, the family business has moved indoors but still serves the same mouth-watering Mexico City-style dishes.
Antojitos is known for its selection of its masa-heavy snacks, from earthy, inky huitlacoche-stuffed (corn fungus) fried quesadillas to ovular, griddled masa disks called huaraches, which are loaded with guisado toppings like cooked squash blossoms.
Meat isn’t the only protein cooked right at Boyle Heights. Mexican-style seafood is also immensely popular; El Siete Mares on E. Cesar Chavez Avenue and El Rinconcito del Mar on E. 1st Street have been serving seafood for 43 years.
Other than the typical ceviches (raw seafood salad “cooked” in lime juice), make sure to try caldo for a surprisingly light and refreshing tomato-based seafood stew bloated with chunks of white fish and shrimp. El Siete Mares also makes a particularly wonderful dish called molcajete de mares: fat, tail-on shrimp, grilled cactus and panela cheese doused in a red, onion-rich spicy sauce that is still bubbling inside a volcanic rock basin.
Boyle Heights is a true historical treasure. The lights might gleam as just a backdrop from the downtown skyscrapers, but Boyle Heights is a vibrant, colorful town that has served as a faithful refuge and gateway for generations of new Angelenos.

What makes a good film?
Frightening veteran · Though The Human Centipede 2 is full of flaws, Laurence R. Harvey plays a stunning role as a bullied loner turned deranged maniac, a portrayal that redeems some of the film’s awkward shortcomings. - Photo courtesy of Brigade Marketing
It’s a simple question that’s also crushingly difficult to answer — film is a varied, dynamic art form that features ever-changing definitions of quality. What if a film isn’t enjoyable in any sense of the word? What, exactly, justifies a movie’s existence?
It’s questions such as these that The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) demands be answered.
The original film, The Human Centipede (First Sequence), was a fantastically grotesque lightning rod of controversy. This, of course, was entirely predictable: The film depicted a horrifying doctor on an experimental quest to sew together three people mouth-to-anus, forming a “human centipede.”
The second follows a mentally ill, sexually and emotionally abused British man who, inspired by the original film, decides to copycat the centipede experiment, with some disturbing new ambitions.
Before we go on, here’s an official disclaimer: This movie is, for better or worse, everything it was hyped up to be. Director Tom Six made a point to declare the second film would be dramatically more graphic, and he certainly kept his word.
In that sense, The Human Centipede 2 is an unfortunate success. It’s the sort of film that would handily win the Oscar for “most jaw-droppingly disgusting feature,” if such an award existed.
What Six does to craft the film’s disturbed ethos is immense: It feels as if every frame is dripping with horrific details, from the skin-crawling sound of lips being licked to the claustrophobic black-and-white compositions that dominate the movie. The Human Centipede 2 begins with an extremely deliberate pace, and the drawn-out sequences only intensify the already overwhelming sensation of discontent inspired by the movie.
The problem, however, is that the first act of the film comes off as surprisingly banal. Though seeing innocent victims get shot, beaten and tied up is shocking at first, the sheer repetition of it all translates into predictability.
This changes as The Human Centipede 2 transits into the actual “experimentation.” It’s here that the film flexes its muscles — Six almost seems to take glee from the roller-coaster ride of brutality, blood and fecal matter that he escalates into torturous new heights.
It’s too much for a premise that proved plenty revolting the first time around sans this sort of graphic detail. It’s no joyride by any sense of the word — even the most perverted viewers will probably shake their heads in disbelief.
On initial judgment, this God-awful obsession with portraying depravity in explicit fashion seems to steal any value from anything The Human Centipede 2 could have possibly been trying to say. Who can take anything away from 87 straight minutes of hammers smashing teeth, surgery with staple guns and gag-inducing torture?
Seriously, who sits through that?
The Human Centipede 2, taken at face value, is a film no one should see. The plot is contrived — the concept of an abused, bullied loner turning deranged is a cliché by now — and the dialogue is borderline unbearable. The violence is beyond extreme and Six knows it.
Though the performance of stage veteran Laurence R. Harvey (as the film’s antagonist Martin Lomax) is incredible — stunning, really — to watch on screen, it still doesn’t appear to save the film from its shortcomings.
But then again, Six really does know all this. He seems to know everything: the reaction that The Human Centipede 2 incites, the criticisms of the original film, the argument surrounding modern shock-horror’s value to the film world, his self-conscious role as a director in the middle of it all.
This is where The Human Centipede 2 begins to justify itself. It makes Six’s decision to call attention to the movie itself logical — there are numerous sequences where the original The Human Centipede is referenced, often in a narcissistic, obvious way. It feels like a mockery on screen, a way to parody the legitimacy of his own movies and the shock-horror genre as a whole.
And with greater analysis, it becomes increasingly difficult to pinpoint whether the movie’s initial flaws are actually flaws or not. Are the plot holes, the sheer stupidity of the victims, the unnecessary everything really signs of shoddy filmmaking? Or is Six just smarter than all of us? The inclusion of a mind-twistingly ambiguous ending sends everything into flux.
In that sense, The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) stands disgustingly — but proudly — above many of the brain-numbing, predictable mainstream flicks to come out this year. It is a movie that will pester you with questions and will inevitably demand thought in its sheer mastery of the revolting. This aspect is not one that can be easily dismissed.
And because of all this, The Human Centipede 2 cannot be confined to a star rating.
So, who sits through films like The Human Centipede 1 and 2? Apparently, we do.
More crucially, what does it say about people, about human nature and the vastness of imagination, of fantasy, of why we would actually pay for what is so clearly terrible for the soul?
Somewhere, Tom Six is laughing.

17-year-old Scotty McCreery captured the hearts of America this spring with his trademark bass-laden country voice that would make any grown man jealous.
This May, he was crowned the most recent winner of the American Idol title and has since become country music’s latest media darling, embarking on a 44-city tour with the Idols 2011 Summer Tour.
Somehow, he found time to record his debut album, Clear As Day, in the five months since his victory. The result is a pop-country crossover album that does not surprise, but certainly does not disappoint.
On Clear As Day, McCreery delivers an album about girls, family and small-town life, building upon the same simple country-boy persona that won him the Idol title in the first place.  The album delivers sweet, emotional ballads such as the title track “Clear As Day”, and up-tempo, quintessential country anthems, such as “Water Tower Town,” in which he sings about everything from Friday night football to pick-up trucks.
Though McCreery and his team have injected an undeniable pop flavor, likely to have a larger commercial appeal, the singer still fully delivers on his country sound. Instrumentally, the album pulls no punches in its country influence, featuring banjos and fiddles, and highlighting slide guitar on almost every track.
Other highlights include one of the album’s singles, “Out of Summertime”, which tells the tale of a summertime love gone sour in the fall, and features a sugary-sweet hook (“Oh, she could’ve been mine, but we ran out of summertime,” McCreery sings) that will be playing in your mind long after the song ends.
Of course, this wouldn’t be a McCreery album review without making mention of his beautiful, baritone country-crooner vocals, which are best showcased on the aforementioned “Clear As Day.” The song is a slow, reflective ballad that takes an emotional, unexpected turn at the end.
Though the record has other similar ballads, McCreery shines on the up-tempo tracks that show off his fun-loving side, like in “Better Than That”, in which McCreery comes off sounding like Taylor Swift’s male counterpart — you can easily imagine this song on country radio today.
If anything, the album only falls short on the tracks when McCreery is trying to pull off a maturity that he doesn’t (and shouldn’t) yet possess.“Back on the Ground” has McCreery singing about coming back home, catching up with his ‘mama’ and reflecting on his youth, when he couldn’t wait to leave town.
It’s a lovely song, but doesn’t really work with him still in the prime of his youth.  It’s quite nonsensical for McCreery, who travels with his mother everywhere he goes (including the Idol tour), to sing this song.
Of course, between the standout tracks and the nonsensical ones, there are a few that remain forgettable thanks to the overuse of country clichés. “Dirty Dishes,” yet another sweet ballad about mama, tells an overly sappy story about his mother thanking God for her kids and her dirty dishes. While it sounds nice in theory, it becomes quite redundant and formulaic.
McCreery delivers a solid debut, easily akin to other male country stars of the moment. If you’re looking for a fun, down-home summertime album sprinkled with ballads about family and heartache, Clear As Day is the one for you. It doesn’t deliver anything groundbreaking to the country world, but it fits right in and provides 41 minutes of pleasant country fare.

Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation earlier today that renders tanning beds off-limits to minors in the state of California. The bill will take effect starting on January 1, 2012, and was part of a handful of other bills related to health initiatives the governor signed in one swoop.
Minors at least 14 years of age are currently able to use an ultraviolet tanning device with parental consent. Senator Ted Lieu (D-Torrance) drafted the bill to fully prevent minors from the dangers and adverse effects of ultraviolet rays.
“I praise Gov. Brown for his courage in taking this much-needed step to protect some of California’s most vulnerable residents – our kids – from what the ‘House of Medicine’ has conclusively shown is lethally dangerous: ultraviolet-emitting radiation from tanning beds,” said Lieu in a statement.
California is the first state to enact a ban on tanning beds. Other health-related legislation signed by Brown includes AB 499, which allows children 12 and older to seek HPV vaccinations and preventative care from sexually transmitted infections without parental consent, and SB 946, which requires health plans to provide early intervention behavioral coverage for autism.
According to the Food and Drug Administration, UV radiation from tanning devices can cause skin cancer, skin burns, premature skin aging and both short- and long-term eye damage. Tanning salons use lamps that emit both UV-A and UV-B radiation, which penetrate both top and deeper layers of the skin.

Infertility might be a sensitive subject to many, but apparently not for Ottawa music station Hot 89.9, which launched a “win a baby” competition with the prize of three rounds of fertility treatment valued at $35,000, the winner of which will be announced tomorrow.
Contestants had to convince listeners and a panel of judges that they were most deserving of a baby in order to win. While more than 400 applications poured into the station from a diverse group of women, same-sex couples and cancer patients eager to win the fertility treatment, many criticized the radio show’s insensitive marketing tactics to bring in contestants. For example, the show used the tagline “See who you think deserves to win a baby” and posters with a baby holding a sign saying “Win me.”
Beverly Hanck, executive director of the Infertility Awareness Association of Canada, was quoted by The Guardian as saying, “The station is clearly capitalizing on vulnerable patients who are desperate to have a family. Has anyone stopped to think how the hundreds of patients who do not win are going to feel?”
The station replied that it was simply trying to do a good thing for families struggling to have children.
Hot 89.9 isn’t the first Canadian station to hand out eyebrow-raising prizes — other bizarre prizes given out in the past include breast implants and a Russian bride.

USC heads into the bye week after a 48-41 victory over the Arizona Wildcats. Arizona came into the Coliseum with only one win on the season but faced three top-10 opponents three weeks in a row. The win gave the Trojans their second win in the South division.
Positives: Junior quarterback Matt Barkley broke the school passing record for a single game with 468 yards. He bested former Heisman winner Carson Palmer, who threw for 448 yards against Oregon in 2002.
Sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods was five yards short of breaking the all-time receiving yards in a single game. Woods tallied 255 yards and two touchdowns against the Wildcats.
Junior safety T.J. McDonald also notched his first interceptions of the year. Coming into the game, Nick Foles had not thrown an interception, but the USC defense forced two in the first quarter.
Negatives: The Trojan defense missed redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris and freshman linebacker Lamar Dawson. Overall, the Trojans gave up 554 total yards and a school-record 37 first downs to the Wildcats. Arizona scored five touchdowns on five straight possessions at one point.
