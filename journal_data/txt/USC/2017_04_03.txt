After being swept by No. 13 Arizona on the road last weekend, the USC baseball team looks to rebound on Tuesday against another difficult opponent in Long Beach State. 
The Trojans were off to a strong start to the season, having won their first two Pac-12 series against Washington State and Arizona State. However, USC’s young and inexperienced pitching staff ran into trouble against a deep Arizona batting order.
The Trojans gave up five or more runs in all three games against the Wildcats, allowing an average of over eight hits per game. Freshman Chris Clarke, sophomore CJ Stubbs and sophomore Marrick Crouse were the weekend’s starting pitchers, and they ultimately all suffered losses against the best hitting team in the conference, as Arizona remained undefeated at home this spring. 
USC’s inconsistency at the plate did little to help its struggling pitching staff. Trojan hitters produced some highlights in the first game, including a home run by senior catcher Cris Perez and an RBI double from freshman outfielder Matthew Acosta, but they could not keep pace with the Wildcats’ scoring output. In Saturday’s 5-1 defeat, Arizona pitchers Randy Labaut and Cody Deason combined to allow just one hit and one run, stifling the entire order.
The Trojan bats came back to life on Sunday, as they produced 10 hits, including an eighth-inning home run by senior outfielder Corey Dempster. But the team was unable to capitalize with runners in scoring position, and the Wildcats cruised to an 8-1 win and a sweep-clinching victory in the series. 
As the team looks to bounce back following that disheartening series, USC goes up against a very solid 16-11 Long Beach State team. The Dirtbags hold victories over familiar Pac-12 foes Cal and Washington State, along with other major programs such as UNC and Oklahoma, and they have played to a sparkling 8-1 mark at home so far this year.
The tilt against Long Beach is also the second leg of a two-game season series between the Trojans and Dirtbags. In late February, the two sides played an 11-inning thriller in Dedeaux Field, with USC ultimately prevailing 4-3 thanks to a walk-off RBI single by redshirt junior shortstop Frankie Rios. USC will need strong efforts again from the likes of Rios (.307 batting average, 13 RBI) and sophomore first baseman Lars Nootbaar (.337 average, 22 RBI) again for the team to notch another victory over Long Beach — this time on the road. 
Long Beach State boasts plenty of threats in its lineup, including junior catcher David Banuelos, who is currently hitting .326 to go along with four home runs. Junior infielder Ramsey Romano is hitting .337, good for eighth-best in the Big West Conference. The Dirtbag pitching staff has also been stellar this year with a team ERA of 3.45 — the 42nd-best in Division I baseball. 
USC will begin its scrap with LBSU 30 miles south of campus at Blair Field. First pitch is slated for 6 p.m. The Trojans then return to Los Angeles for a weekend series with No. 21 Stanford, though the series will start on Thursday and conclude on Saturday instead of the usual Friday to Sunday format. Stanford was ranked
No. 11 last week before being swept at home by No. 1 Oregon State and falling to 2-4 in conference play.
It was more than a sweep with a lack luster performance both hitting and pitching. Sad with Oregon St. ranked first
in the nation while the Trojans have had so many forgettable years under Chad Krueter, Frank Cruz, and now Dan Hubbs.
A once stellar program having lost all credibility in the national picture. One position player in the Major Leagues on  
opening day with a few pitchers trying to survive in the bullpen.

Head coach Clay Helton secured the first member of his 2019 signing class on Monday as dual-position star De’Gabriel Floyd committed to USC football. Floyd currently plays running back and linebacker for Hawkins High School, which also produced wide receiver Joseph Lewis and athlete Greg Johnson (who signed for USC as a tandem during this year’s National Signing Day in February), and Floyd is listed as the No. 2 athlete on 247Sports’ 2019 composite rankings.
The five-star recruit was holding offers from five other
Pac-12 programs and the likes of Georgia, Tennessee, Michigan and Notre Dame when he opted for USC. He announced his commitment on Twitter, thanking God, his family and his coaches.
 “With that being said, I would like to say I am committing to the University of Southern California,” Floyd tweeted.
 Floyd is still years away from signing his letter of intent to lock his commitment to USC, but the L.A. native’s decision seemed firm in an interview with Scout.com.
 “It just felt right,” Floyd said. “USC is the school I’ve always wanted to go to. I talked to my mom and my sister about it, and this is something I’ve been thinking about doing for the last two weeks.
 “We talked about what’s in store for me in the future, and I’m just really comfortable there with the coaches. Like I said, it just felt right.”
Floyd already stands at
6 feet 3 inches and 220 pounds as a high school sophomore, so Helton will be keen to bring him into the fold in two-plus years’ time. Floyd’s commitment also further strengthens USC’s growing connection with Hawkins High, which now boasts four commitments in three Trojan recruiting classes from 2017 to 2019. Standout Hawkins cornerback Marcus Johnson is currently committed to USC’s 2018 class, alongside four other recruits in ESPN’s Junior 300.
Despite all the recruiting attention he could command in the coming years, Floyd said he was happy to be finished with the process.
“I know it’s early for me, but I wanted to get it done now so I could just focus on other things and not have to worry about recruiting,” Floyd said. “I’m actually super relieved and excited at the same time.”
 As for his college position, Floyd said he just wanted to see the field.
 “I’m open to playing anywhere they want me,” Floyd said. “I’ll try anything.”

The start of the regular season brings hope and anticipation to all 30 clubs across Major League Baseball. Even for the franchises not expected to make much noise in 2017, there is something refreshing and exhilarating about the prospect of a clean slate. And in a sport that sees 162 games played over the course of a season, almost anything is possible for any team during the next five months. 
For the Los Angeles Dodgers, yesterday’s Opening Day matchup commenced another opportunity to put an end to the franchise’s 29-year World Series drought. 
If Dodger fans wanted a good omen to open up the regular season, then they got that — and some — in the team’s season-opening 14-3 victory over the visiting San Diego Padres on Monday. Seven innings of one-run ball from ace Clayton Kershaw paired with four long balls offensively (two from catcher Yasmani Grandal) gave the Dodgers a dominant Opening Day win that makes you believe they can live up to the hype they have generated for themselves. 
Of course, it’s wonderful to have the national pastime back in the national spotlight on a daily basis. However, for Dodger fans, you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone overemphasizing the need for a stellar regular season effort from the team; for the fans of the Dodgers, it’s all about what their team goes on to accomplish in October that will count for any merit. Only in postseason success will Dodgers fandom find any feelings of satisfaction. 
While the prospect of a 100-win regular season is appealing, it’s not the true desire of those bleeding Dodger blue.
We’ve sat at the postseason dinner table far too often without receiving the entree we feel we’ve deserved: a World Series championship. As great as four consecutive NL West division titles have been, Dodger fans demand an October run to the Commissioner’s Trophy — heck, at least a berth in the Fall Classic. 
In a city such as Los Angeles, the Dodgers’ 29-year title drought has felt like the equivalent of the Chicago Cubs’ most recent 108-year World Series absence. 
As wonderful as it has been seeing someone like Kershaw ascend to the top of the baseball world over the past decade — winning three Cy Young Awards and the MVP in 2014 — nothing would further cement Kershaw’s status as one of the Dodger greats than a World Series title. 
The Dodgers’ last four trips to the postseason have ended in the following rounds: NLCS, NLDS, NLDS and NLCS. If this confirms anything, it’s simple: Los Angeles enters 2017 with a World-Series-or-bust mentality. 
My younger years of consuming baseball were scarred with brutal memories of the Dodgers flubbing at the most crucial points in the postseason. What Dodgers fan can forget those tragic battles with the Philadelphia Phillies all those years ago in the 2008 and 2009 Championship Series (curse you, Jonathan Broxton)? I was just 16 when the Dodgers got carved up by Cardinals pitcher Michael Wacha in the 2013 NLCS — St. Louis topped the Dodgers in the 2013 NLCS and 2014 NLDS. 
And don’t think for one second that the Dodgers opening every season as Vegas’ favorite to win it all consoles me in any way. Once again, the Dodgers open the 2017 season as World Series favorites in the eyes of many — including Sports Illustrated, who predicted the Dodgers topping the Cleveland Indians in the Fall Classic. If we have learned anything as a nation over the past year, it’s that you can never trust the projection polls — no matter how secure they may seem. 
For Dodgers manager Dave Roberts and company, the upcoming 161 games will no doubt be a grueling and critical gantlet. But no matter what impressive feats the Dodgers rattle off over the next five months of play, nothing will define the team’s 2017 campaign more than a World Series trophy at the end of it. 
Of course, a trip to the postseason is guaranteed to no team. But for the Dodgers — who entered Opening Day with the highest payroll in baseball ($225 million) for the fourth consecutive season — there is no reasonable excuse to not clinch a playoff berth. 
It’s simple: The Dodgers need to play as big as their bankroll, not only over the duration of the regular season, but also especially into September and October. Some may consider Dodger fans a spoiled bunch for not “appreciating” four straight division titles (a franchise record), but in a title town like Los Angeles, the only standard is a championship standard. 
The Dodgers need no more division titles — we’ve got plenty of them represented at Chavez Ravine. The only merit Los Angeles can afford to accept now is a 2017 World Series pennant to accompany the franchise’s long-lonely world titles from the 1950s, 1960s and 1980s that run down Dodger Stadium’s right-field line.

Healthy is the new beautiful — at least that’s how it seems lately with the emergence of organic, cruelty-free, chemical-free and gluten-free products among up-and-coming makeup companies. Vermillion lips and opalescent eyeshadows are no longer our only definition of beauty, and in its place stand natural, radiance-boosting makeup brands such as Glossier.
Glossier creates its trademark cosmetics effortlessly, branding itself  as a movement that celebrates the authenticity of makeup consumers. Founded on the ideology of simple and personal makeup products, Glossier recently celebrated its third year with the opening of a pop-up booth nestled in an alley between Anya Hindmarch and Frame Denim at Melrose Place last weekend.
The digital beauty brand, which launched in 2014, set out to further market its products in Los Angeles with a fun, interactive twist. Greeted with pale pink curtains and free tote bags next to a fresh flower display, guests were introduced to five product stations for Cloud Paint, Haloscope, Generation G, The Do-Everything Skin Salve and the brand’s signature product, The Boy Brow.
Guests were permitted to sample products while staff in pale pink jumpsuits presented each product’s benefits and greeted visitors. Floor-length mirrors with phrases like “You Look Good” and “Nice Brows” dotted the alley, enhancing the visual experience for guests.
Aiming to reinvent the definition of beauty, Glossier’s novel product was its Glossier Phase 1 Set, which included its fan-favorite Priming Mosturizer and Balm Dotcom. Both are designed to enhance — rather than alter — physical appearance.
Glossier, the brainchild of Emily Weiss, was first conceived in 2010 through her beauty blog Into The Gloss, which found its success by sampling every product under the sun. It has since grown into a popular name within the $250 billion cosmetic industry under its unique concept that emphasizes natural beauty — “Skin is in.”
Focused on bringing out perfect, dewy skin with skincare basics, Glossier has gained major traction with its moisturizing formula. In recent months, Glossier has boosted its online fame through social media brand ambassadors, who try out products and review them for their followers.
The brand is known for its versatility: It has caught the attention of social media and beauty gurus for creating unique products and catering more toward people of color. 
Nicole Young, a junior majoring in communication, was impressed by Glossier’s unique marketing strategy after attending the event on Sunday. The pop-up booth allowed curious consumers such as Young to explore cosmetics beyond mainstream brands found in makeup stores, like Sephora and Ulta Beauty. 
“It’s always difficult shopping online for stuff, especially cosmetics that aren’t sold at any large retailers,” Young said. “It was nice to be able to test out different products.”

I am racing in a half-marathon on Saturday. Just a few short days from now, I’ll be bouncing up and down trying to stay warm and shake off the jitters before the race begins. The sun will barely be rising on Hollywood Boulevard.
The crowd of participants will be wearing various types of dry-fit shirts in different shades of neon colors. Without fail, this is my least favorite part of racing. No matter how many times I run, the pre-race anticipation never gets any easier.
The anxiety comes in stages. The first wave, which I call the “tapering terror,” starts days before the actual race. Most runners taper, or run less mileage, in the week or two before their race because they want their legs to be fresh and rested before the big day. It starts to feel suspiciously easy to run less, and I worry about getting a false sense of confidence.
This is the first year I’ll be running the half-marathon with a time to beat. Last year, I ran my first half-marathon on a flat course in two hours and a minute. That means I averaged a little less than 9:20 per mile for 13.1 miles. It was a good start, considering I ran that race while studying abroad and never trained more than five miles.
In theory, it should be a breeze to beat that time. I’ve been training more, and I know what to expect when I’m racing this distance. But just last week, I was running on the treadmill and the nine-minute pace, which is less than 20 seconds faster than my average time last year, seemed exhausting. I’m not sure how long I’ll be able to keep that up.
The next stage of pre-race jitters hits me the day before. I know from experience that what you eat and how much you sleep have a huge impact on how you feel during the race. I’m never too worried about making it to the finish line, but I am worried about whether those two hours of running will be fun and carefree or long and painful. 
To avoid the latter, I usually eat a satisfying carb-loaded meal and try to get eight hours of sleep the night before. I also chug about a week’s worth of water in that one day. If there’s one thing that can make running awful, it’s being dehydrated. Somehow, though, all the pasta and water in the world doesn’t put the day-before doubts”to rest. I usually end up rolling around a little bit before I fall asleep, wrestling with the idea that I should have done something different in my training.
By the next morning though, those doubts give way to the race day reasoning. It’s a more subdued kind of nervousness because at this point, I’ve usually already accepted my fate and my lack of training. I will pull on my race day outfit (the dry-fit shirt that fits just right, a pair of running shorts that don’t ride up and a pair of socks that don’t fall down), and maybe add a few last-minute songs to my running playlist. 
As I say goodbye to my belongings at bag check and find a bathroom in the minutes before gathering at the starting line, the craziness of it all starts to set in. Why would I pay to get up before the sun rises just to run on a street usually filled with cars? In the moments before the race begins, it’s cold and crowded and the butterflies in my stomach make me feel a little uneasy.
But by the time the gun goes off, all the worries fade away. I love running so much because I can be in the present. I can take it one step at a time, and every step feels so familiar, like I’ve done it a million times before. Yet each race is new and challenging, which makes conquering the pre-race fears and the race itself all the more satisfying.

In an industry dominated by male producers and directors, the Feminist Media Festival aims to inspire and encourage works by female filmmakers. 
The Women of Cinematic Arts hosted the first ever event at the School of Cinematic Arts on Sunday to demonstrate the value of women’s voices in the entertainment industry, showcasing a number of short films produced by students. 
Female industry professionals Iram Parveen Bilal, Liz Manashil, Pier Nirandara, Shirit Bradley and Carlyn LaHorgue served as judges at the festival. These women are currently employed at a number of institutions within the film industry such as ICM Partners, Legendary, Warner Bros. and Miramax. Films were judged in three categories: narrative, non-narrative and intersectionality. In addition to recognition for their work, filmmakers also received gift cards to Samy’s Camera.
The club hopes that the event worked to create change in an industry that many say desperately needs it.
“The organization has existed since 2005, but a majority of our events center around discussing the issue without promoting physical change,” said Sarah Jones, the president of Women of Cinematic Arts.  “We decided to create the festival to support new voices and create an inclusive community to physically make a difference.” 
The night opened with screening of the selected submissions in the Ray Stark Theater. In order to qualify for the festival, films had to have been created by teams that were at least 50 percent female. Additionally, each film was required to pass the Bechdel test, in which two female characters must appear on-screen talking about a topic other than a man. 
A wide variety of genres of short films were screened. In the narrative category, “Prudence” used whimsical flashbacks to tell the story of an old war veteran finally getting rewarded for her service to her country after being discharged because of a lesbian relationship. “Drill” presented a visual metaphor for women’s struggles through a comedic race between a man and a woman. 
“Relentless” explored a young girl’s journey after she chose to pursue a career in boxing instead of attending college. Tayanna Todd, a junior double majoring in Spanish and film and television production, explained her inspiration for the project.
“For me, it’s about telling stories I’m passionate about,” Todd said. “I want to encourage the audience to pursue their passions despite obstacles, just like I’ve been inspired to pursue filmmaking to tell stories.”
Short films like “A Period Piece” and “Whipped” delved into comedy, drawing chuckles from the audience. Others, like “Treasure” and “Sweet Dreams,” used impressive and original animation, and the documentary “Meri Gehrai” took spectators on a journey to India to investigate the status of transgender rights.
Angie Sabaduquia, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies, worked on “A Period Piece.” At the beginning of the year, she formed a creative team from several Women of Cinematic Arts mixers.
Jennifer Smart, a junior majoring in critical studies, said she enjoyed viewing the short films throughout the festival.
“I thought all the films were amazing, and I really enjoyed ‘Prudence’ because I felt like it took on a subject matter that you don’t often see represented on screen,” Smart said. “It covered diversity across the board.”
“Prudence” took home the top prize in the narrative category was and “Relentless” won an honorable mention. The non-narrative prize went to “Treasure,” with an honorable mention for “Sweet Dreams.” Finally, “Seahorse” won the intersectionality award for exploring a diverse combination of issues and genres. 
Aneesha Madhok, a junior majoring in theater and one of the student filmmakers, said that events like the Feminist Media Festival could have a profound impact. 
“I love feminist media, and I wish there were more films made by women so that men growing up can realize that women can make successful films and understand a woman’s perspective so the world is not dictated only by the man’s perspective,” Madhok said. “Films are a powerful social media to influence perspectives.”
This year’s Feminist Media Festival ended on a high note, allowing student filmmakers to understand the value of having their own personal narrative to create and tell memorable stories.

Since Betsy DeVos’ appointment as Secretary of Education, controversy has ensued regarding the condition of the public school system, the ethics of for-profit schools and the efficacy of charter schools. President Donald Trump’s administration recently proposed a $168 million increase in charter school funding, but this decision may not positively impact education. While some charter schools offer resources and support — for example, for students with disabilities — that many public schools fail to provide, their privatization of academic leadership and use of taxpayer money wholly undercut the public school system and fail to address problems that affect the majority of students.
One of the biggest issues that plagues public education is the lack of federal funding. The U.S. government pays for approximately 13 percent of total expenditures for public schools across the country. Depending on the state, states pay a little less than 50 percent, typically funded by income tax. The rest is paid by local governments, usually through property tax.
Because a large portion of the funding is provided by the local governments, disparity in quality of education is monumental. This is especially prevalent in low-income areas in which taxes received by schools are considerably less than in higher-income areas. Many public school systems are considered “failing” because they do not have adequate funding for the volume of students, and students may be predestined to perform worse at schools where they lack opportunities.
Various politicians and charter-school advocates have argued that charter schools are the antidote to the crippling problem. However, privately administrated schools that use taxpayer money, also known as “public” charter schools, may create more issues than they solve.
Charter schools are publicly funded but unaccountable. They are not governed by elected officials, they control the amount of students that enroll and many are not transparent with the money received from taxpayers. Charter schools are championed as schools that accommodate disabilities, provide more help with English-language learners and promote diversity. In reality, their demographics are startling.
An in-depth Washington Post analysis published in late March comparing Arizona public schools to BASIS, a chain of 18 charter schools in Arizona, found that the school chain heavily over-enrolled Asian students and under-enrolled Latino students. Just 1.23 percent of students enrolled had a learning disability, compared with the 11.3 percent enrolled in Arizona public schools. The school has no free lunch program, while over 47 percent of Arizona public school students receive reduced-price or free lunches. BASIS schools do not provide transportation, making it difficult for working families to get kids to and from school. These charter schools intentionally poach high achievers from public schools, all while leaving less-affluent and disabled children in the public system. Charter schools should be for students who are unable to receive a proper education in the public system. Students from poorer or more rural areas or students with disabilities are the demographics that charter schools should be targeting. Instead, wealthier and already high-achieving students are chosen, which continues to widen the inequality gap.
More than half of students at BASIS will not graduate once enrolled. Theoretically, this could tank their ratings among schools in Arizona, but it actually achieves the opposite. Because the students who stay are academically advanced and have taken countless AP classes, BASIS schools are highly ranked for college readiness, so more parents express interest in charter schools. The founders of the school once operated publicly, but when the founding couple decided to operate out of a privately-owned company, their salaries were hidden. They charged $46,000 in travel expenses during their first year of operating BASIS, paid for with public money. These schools have absolutely no accountability, and legal action can be extremely difficult because they are not held to the same standard as public schools.
Public education is not something that can be thrown away and replaced with a new system. In order to properly educate students across the country, the public system must be amended and proper funding for schools must be enacted. Funding for education is only 3 percent of the annual federal budget. Serious reform is desperately needed across public schools. Charter schools may be appropriate for some students, but this is a very tiny fraction of the population. If the Trump administration wants to reform the education system, funding for low-income public schools is a good start.

There was a giddiness ignited in me when I logged onto IMDbPro yesterday to discover that, after months of vocal condemnation of whitewashing and through the ridiculous “I Am Major” campaign, director Rupert Sanders’ Ghost in the Shell earned a measly $19 million its opening weekend. The picture came in No. 3 in the box office, grossing almost two times less than runner-up Beauty and the Beast and (the best part) the winner: Boss Baby.
Yes, for all the talk and excuses that a movie requires a white lead to find a significant audience (and thus, financial success), a movie where a white woman plays the role originally occupied by a Japanese character was beat out by an animated picture starring a talking baby. 
It cannot really be said that Ghost in the Shell did not perform well in its first weekend because people boycotted the movie for its practice of whitewashing. But what can be said is that audiences, the elusive and faceless target whom producers with every picture hope to woo, didn’t care either way. This, as passive as it seems, is critically important.
It’s impossible to measure how audiences feel about the practice of whitewashing, but it is possible to measure how much they’ll pay for it. And by and large, last weekend they did not. If producers want to talk about money, then it won’t take anti-whitewashing protests, think pieces, social media posts or campaigns to get their attention. What it will take is financial apathy, and last weekend proved it to be true: People did not care about Ghost in the Shell. Maybe it wouldn’t have performed better with an actual Japanese actress, but it sure didn’t do well with Scarlett Johansson as the lead. And this enough should be hard proof to the industry that starring white protagonists does not guarantee a good weekend in the box office.
How, then, can Hollywood explain Hidden Figures, a movie about black female mathematicians at NASA, which became the highest-grossing Best Picture nominee of 2016? Or the actual Best Picture winner Moonlight, which experienced the highest per-theater averages for the same year? And what about diverse movies like the Fast and Furious franchise, Star Wars: Rogue One and Moana, which continue to experience financial success worldwide?
Sure, call these anomalies. But then again, there are so many of them. And there are so many flops of movies starring white people and white people replacing people of color. Does Hollywood think Aloha will be remembered for anything other than Emma Stone pretending to be a woman named Allison Ng? What about box office failures Alice Through the Looking Glass, 2016’s Ben-Hur, Deepwater Horizon and The BFG? Why do movies starring white people get so many chances, and why isn’t anyone pointing to Moonlight, Get Out and Moana and saying, “Look — here is what works and here is what people want”?
For too long has goodness and good art been associated with white men and women, and for too long has Hollywood’s producing practices been based on this unfounded mythology. The latter half of 2016 saw a revival in critically acclaimed and financially successful films starring actors of color, and this combined with Ghost in the Shell’s muted reception surely signals an end — if not of Hollywood’s habit of erasing minority voices, then at least of audiences’ tolerance of it.
Still, when we call one thing the panacea to industry-standard racism, we ignore the systemically prejudiced institution that has pervaded this country for centuries. Nevertheless, it’s time Hollywood starts to listen.
I am tired of excuses made by Hollywood players who erase and ignore diverse voices because they are not, in their minds, monetarily valuable. Because when those decisions are made and groups of people never see themselves on screen, they begin to believe they themselves are not valuable. 
And here’s what happens when the industry looks at its products purely as money-making schemes: The quality suffers. And what’s worse, this suffocating mindset puts the American viewership in one big group — a faceless, colorless mass. It treats American moviegoers as a mindless body attracted only to shine and star power, bright explosions and loud booms and only the next great feat in visual effects. 
The opposite of that — the unconditional and noble belief that audiences are intelligent and know how to define a good movie — that is something the advent of television’s golden age seizes on. When a movie is good, it does not matter to the audience who the characters are. Not the color of their skin, not their gender, not who they love or not where they come from. Good storytelling renders all of those factors void because if it’s good, people will watch. 
Zoe Cheng is a sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television. Her column, “Cross Section,” runs every other Tuesday.
I boycotted Ghost In The Shell because of an article on Breitbart where Scarlet Johannsen practically dared conservatives to boycott her movies if they didn’t like her leftist politics. 
I took her up on her challenge. I even went to the movie theater and watched “Life” just so I could enjoy NOT spending money on “Ghost In The Shell.”

John O’Brien, executive vice dean of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, died on Friday. He was 48.
O’Brien became an assistant professor of electrical engineering at USC in 1997.
“[O’Brien’s] lasting legacy will be that he helped establish in the school a remarkable culture of collaboration and inclusion, one based on character and ethics, respect and understanding, selflessness and kindness, service and commitment, and the constant pursuit of excellence,” Viterbi Dean Yannis Yortsos wrote in a memo to the USC Viterbi faculty and staff.
O’Brien received the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 1999, the U.S. government’s highest award for scientists and engineers in the early stages of their independent research careers.
He also developed electrical engineering courses for Viterbi, such as EE 509 Electromagnetics for Semiconductor Photonics and EE 599 Advanced Quantum Mechanics.
“John’s passing is a tragic loss for me and for all of his colleagues at USC,” Professor Dan Dapkus told USC News. “He was also a wonderful mentor to his students -— demonstrating and expecting excellence — yet always available to share his knowledge and insights. Working with him has been a high point in my career at USC.”
O’Brien had earned his master’s degree and Ph.D. in applied physics from the California Institute of Technology in 1993 and 1996, respectively. O’Brien also received his bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Iowa State University.
A funeral service will be held in Des Moines, Iowa on an unspecified date, while a Viterbi event celebrating O’Brien’s life will be held on campus in the next few weeks.

For 24 hours from Sunday to Monday, Tommy Trojan was surrounded by students, chanting names of victims of world atrocities.
These students were participating in Together We Remember, a 24-hour vigil hosted by the USC chapter of Students Taking Action Now: Darfur, a group that aims to prevent and spread awareness about genocide. 
Jason Nikora, a member of STAND and a writer for the Daily Trojan, found it powerful to recognize the victims of the past.
“For a couple of seconds, they get to exist in time again,” Nikora said. “We get to recognize the fact that what happened to them is terrible and honor them in this sort of way.”
Based on the Jewish custom of placing a pebble on the graves of deceased family members, the event sought to honor those who have been killed — no matter their background, religious preference or country of origin.
“We want to honor the people of the past by reading their names, but we also want to honor them in the best way that we can, which is by preventing that from happening in the future, or at least reducing the effects of genocide and atrocities,” said Darcy Gleeson, the Western regional organizer of STAND. “The best way to do that is to make sure everyone knows that they’re happening.” 
In addition to the vigil, STAND hosted a table of information about global genocides, guest speakers who read poetry and novels and an open forum for a community discussion. 
“Just to hear the facts is powerful,” Gleeson said. “There are still some people that don’t believe that the Holocaust happened, and there’s still some people that don’t believe that other atrocities are truly happening.”
One of the ways that STAND spread these facts was through a virtual reality video students could watch at the table. It gave a 360 degree look into the lives of the Rohingya, a Muslim minority group in Burma which is most at risk for genocide in the world, according to Gleeson. Around 90 percent of the population in Burma is Buddhist.
“The Rohingya are among the few Muslim minority groups that have been marginalized for a long time in Burma and have more recently been targeted and placed into what we call kind of like early stage Auschwitz,” Gleeson said. “We have our partners at the Nexus fund [that] basically smuggled themselves into Burma to make this virtual reality film and disseminate it and get the word out about what’s happening.”
Passersby could also sign a petition to protest the U.S. government’s recent action to reduce the State Department’s funding for foreign aid. Currently making up less than 1 percent of the federal budget, foreign aid gives the government the ability to help at-risk people without military intervention.
“The day that we don’t have to have [a foreign aid fund] is the day that we’ve ended genocide, which is obviously a long way off,” Nikora said. “People in Sudan, for instance, or Burma are completely cut off from the outside world. It’s very difficult for them to get food, to get clean water, medicine, so that really just goes toward that, trying to get them up to a better standard of living as best we can.”
STAND hopes the event will cause students to reflect on the world outside of campus, something that can at times be difficult to remember to do. Jenna Dresner, a STAND member, thinks that the USC community, while known for its diversity, should take a harder look at history.
“There is some level of apathy,” Dresner said. “We’re at USC [in] beautiful Los Angeles and why would we even think of people around the world that are being affected by mass atrocities? So by hosting, we’re saying, ‘We’re here,                   and we care.’”
WOW 24 HOURS, don’t you all just feel so proud. I’m sure you just put a stop to all genocide.
Are you also STANDING for to horrid genocide ideal acts of the murdering of millions of babies by their mothers? This is the unspoken genocide of the helpless unborn child. Do you stand against for that, too?

USC is one of 31 leading research universities to come out against President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration in an ongoing court case.
On Friday, the universities filed an amicus curiae brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in support of repealing the order, which temporarily bans immigration from six majority-Muslim countries. Amicus curiae briefs can be filed by any party with an interest in the outcome of the case and provide additional information for judges to help make their decisions.
USC enrolls the second-highest number of international students of any American university and employs a significant number of faculty from foreign nations. As a result, the University has an interest in safeguarding against legal developments that limit travel to and from the U.S., the brief says.
The brief states that the filing higher education institutions, which include USC, Stanford University, Dartmouth College, Cornell University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and others, benefit greatly from the contributions of the international students and faculty that hail from the restricted countries, and that Trump’s executive order prevents these institutions from creating the most diverse and stimulating academic environment possible.
The University did not immediately respond for comment when asked about the amicus filing.
Trump signed the executive order, which limits travel and immigration from Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Libya, on March 6, after a federal judge struck down the first order that Trump signed days after his inauguration.  Judges in Hawaii, Maryland and Virginia issued injunctions that stopped the most recent executive order from also taking effect.
The brief argues that “the international members of [the universities’] communities contribute to the vibrant campus life, world-class educational offerings and research discoveries for which [the universities] are well known.” It goes on to say that the contributions these students make to campus cultures and intellectual environments are indispensable.
Furthermore, the brief states that the executive order “divides current students and their families, impairs the ability of American universities to draw the finest international talent and inhibits the free exchange of ideas.”
Kudos to USC. For those alums that disagree with this decision there are more than enough of us who support this move. Glad that USC is stepping up to counter this obvious muslim ban in cleaned-up clothing. 
You still haven’t explained how this is a Muslim ban, considering the vast majority of Muslims in the world are completely unaffected.
Also, as to the Muslims who are impacted… You’ve failed to explain how that’s a problem.  The majority of international terror in the world right now is done in the name of Islam, not just single acts of terror like Nice, London, Paris, New York, Boston, Egypt etc… but also the ongoing war, killing and destruction of groups like ISIS, Hezbollah and Al Qaida.  Most of these organizations are centered around the middle east… So it should come as no surprise to normal and intelligent people in the world that any effort to curb such international terror by additional vetting and scrutiny will affect nations from that part of the world… that are.. wait for it… PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM.  One plus one equals two!
I’m an alumnus (all four years undergrad) who supports our immigration laws and President.  This is an outrageous expenditure of university resources.  It’s time to stop donating to USC, which apparently cares less about Americans and educating our citizens than receiving tuition indirectly from member states that support Sharia law and terrorism.
One wonders whether the powers that be at USC would feel any remorse if a Muslim immigrant kills students here?
Or will they be like Angela Merkel who hides her head in the Arabian sand while countless German women are raped and brutalized?
How sad, how pathetic and short-sighted and stupid.  All of it just so as to look avant-garde.
I’m beginning to be troubled by my beloved alma mater, and may soon withdraw my annual support.  (If necessary, I will encourage my network of alumni to do the same.) The histrionics over a temporary travel ban from a handful of nations, that doesn’t even impact the majority of our world’s Muslims, is beyond the pale.  This is a temporary travel ban; not new immigration law.  Even the judges who have ruled against it realize that this decision is so squarely within the purview of any sitting president, that they have had to look OUTSIDE the four corners of the document in order to stop it.  This sort of judicial overreach is clearly politically motivated and should alarm everyone.  Trump isn’t even close to perfect, but what we have going on in our nation right now is total obstructionism.  Democrats would stop the President from going to the bathroom if they could.
Another reason why I stopped donating to the university. I agree with Russell and Lil.  President Trump’s immigration order is not a ban, but puts processes I place to more adequately research the backgrounds of new visa requests, and to put in place processes and procedures to track all imm I grants and their status of the visa, green card, student visa, etc…. there are too many illegals in this country who come legally, but have let their status lapse, thus they are illegally in this country.  That’s the soft aspect of the order.
The other side is to ful I you better out the incoming immigrants, but placing a 90 day hold on entrance until their b a cm ground check is confirmed.  Theuniversity might be OK with leaving their roots unlocked but we are not.  Perhaps ever university board and administrators, I cluck get the university president should leave their homes unlocked 24×7, so that they can prove there’s noth I no to be concerned about.
This is foolishness at best, by people who should know better. What a disappointment this university has become, thanks to a Nikias and his cohorts in crime. I hope the university will lose federal funding if this continues.
As an alumni, appalled the university is taking this action. 
There is no “anti-muslim” ban, that is a narrative being put forth by the extremist left as its ongoing tempertantrum at the election results continues to undermine the country coming together.   
The President, plainly put, has the authority to act on immigration based on national security and has.   
These trivial law suits are a distraction.
The country has real problems and we should focus on them.
What has happened to USC?
What happened to USC?…It’s trying too hard to fit in. It’s trying to jump on the activist-bandwagon. That’s what happened.
You better checkout his list of more than 50 lawsuits since in office.   He is on course to get more law suits than all other Prez combined!  We better not be paying for that sobs defense, we already pay a lot more than a million dollars a day to protect Drumpf’s hillbillies for some reason.  If they want protection, force the conceded bone heads to move into WH and make them pay for their global travel and Drump’s weekly vacations to that slum in Florida.
I will never understand why a sane person would ever cast a vote for a confirmed sexual preditor, war hawk, womanizer, insane, racist, serial rapist, mentally incompetent, hate monger, does not pay his fair share of taxes, rips off thousands of people for billions so he does not have to pay it back, thinks a dumb wall will make him safer (is a multi trillion dollar waste of our money), perpetual liar and a disaster at every level that will take America back another 100 years.
He will never be my Prez!  He is so old he will be lucky to live until 2018 and has health issues he is obviously concealing. 
Yes, the temper tantrum of the extremists at the outright rejection of their belief system is staggering.  And the long term damage it is doing to our democracy is certain.
But unless you have given up your citizenship and left the country he is your President and it’s in every human being on earths best interest that he be wildly successful.
Stop being myopic and selfish and see the big picture.
You’re such a tool.  Why don’t you spend some time on articulating a reasoned and original argument of your own.  Maybe then, you’ll be taken seriously.
“I feel your pain” after eight years of Obama, for he was the most despicable president imaginable.  His embrace of the Muslim Brotherhood, his enabling of Russia’s barbaric support of the Muslim dictator Assad, his tacit support of Hamas, his lies about Islam’s influence in America and across the history of time.

The No. 9 women’s lacrosse team earned two commanding victories this weekend at home, defeating Fresno State 21-5 on Friday and Cal 21-4 on Sunday.
Friday’s win was USC’s 21st at home and their ninth of the season, advancing their record to 9-3 overall. Freshman midfielder Kaeli Huff led the team with a career high five goals. Senior attacker Michaela Michael also demonstrated her skill, notching three goals within the first five minutes of the contest in addition to recording 11 draw controls. Senior Cynthia Del Core tallied three goals of her own as well as two ground balls and a caused turnover.
The Trojans also demonstrated a tight-knit defense, working to force 16 turnovers, picking up 21 ground balls compared to the Bulldogs’ nine.
USC continued their momentum into Sunday’s contest, coming out fiery right away jumping out to a commanding 14-0 lead, leaving the Golden Bears scoreless for the first 39 minutes of competition.
“We played with urgency right off the bat and we just let the ball do the work,” head coach Lindsay Munday said. “Our offense was working together really well – they were just waiting on good opportunities and were able to put the shots away,”
With 25 minutes left in competition and a 17-0 Trojan lead, Cal exhibited a 3-0 run firing three quick shots into the back of the net, but the Trojans responded with two goals of their own to provide them with a 19-3 lead.
In the victory, Michael registered six goals, an assist and six draw controls, earning her 34th career hat trick. Ten Trojans scored throughout the contest including seven with multiple goals, demonstrating the depth of the USC roster.
“We’ve been trying to push our fast breaks more — we have really fast, fresh legs and I think that’s one of our strengths and we haven’t really exploited it as much earlier in the season,” senior attacker Kylie Drexel said.
On defense, junior midfielder Lydia Sutton picked up two ground balls and executed two caused turnovers in addition to a draw control, proving to be instrumental in transitioning the ball for the Trojans.
Munday attributed the team’s success to working together as a unit.
“It’s working together — all seven players and the goalie working together and just doing their job so that a unit works as best it can,” Munday said. “The key is just playing simple and playing together.”
With a tough schedule ahead, Munday highlights the importance of learning something from each and every practice and game.
“We’re just trying to get better every single day and I think that’s what’s been a staple for our program from the beginning,” Munday said. “I think that we are getting better so we just need to continue to push ourselves in practice and learn from each and every game and continue to get better, because we have some huge conference opponents coming up.”
Up next, the Trojans are scheduled for two back-to-back MPSF competitions, taking on Oregon on Friday and San Diego State on Saturday.

As the weather gets warmer, we try to find more ways to have fun, and what better way to celebrate California’s beautiful climate than by going to the ocean? But maybe you’re bored of going to the same beaches over and over again. Maybe you’re looking for a fresh destination to visit.
Santa Catalina Island, better known simply as Catalina Island, is a perfect choice. I have been there twice in the summer and the experience has always been amazing. The clear blue water, the smell of the sea and the palm trees and buildings standing cheerfully on the rolling hills create an environment very like the Mediterranean coastline in Europe.

To get there, I had to take the Catalina Express, a boat that departs Long Beach and heads straight to Catalina Island. It took about an hour at sea, so for those of you who gets seasick easily, bring some medication that might help. A less well-known fact about the Catalina Express: It’s completely free on your birthday! Just bring an ID and you can get to Catalina Island for free.
The boat docks in Avalon Bay on the eastern side of the island. The city of Avalon sits close by, offering boutique shops and cute restaurants in picturesque boulevards lined with palm trees. I spent hours just going in and out of stores and enjoying the laid-back atmosphere and people’s friendly attitudes. Best of all, there are barely any cars, so I was able to freely walk around the city.

There are many other things to do in Catalina Island other than shopping and dining. Water sports, including snorkeling, surfing and diving, are available for visitors, and there are boat and submarine rides around the island as well. For those of you who are more interested in land-based activities, you can find safaris around the island, zipline adventures, spas and even golf courses.

“I honestly can’t keep track of all your guys.” 
I’ve heard my friends say this to me enough to make me wonder if I’m truly as boy crazy as it seems. Yes, it’s true — I feel like I have a new fling every month. And as someone who jumped into a semi-relationship during the very first week of freshman year, there have been few moments during my time in college when I wasn’t pining over a boy.
When I first came to college, I had very little experience with dating, so I was eager to find romance — and looking back at it, I was pretty disillusioned about what that meant on a college campus. I guess I was pretty lucky to even meet someone right off the bat, but that only lasted for a few months, and so my spree of temporary love interests began. Going to a school as big as USC and with as many good-looking options only made it easier to move on to the next boy after it didn’t work out with one. I went through waves of flings, some more serious than others, but I always ended up back in the same place.
“I just don’t want a relationship right now.”
Engrave this on my tombstone when I die because I swear it’ll be my cause of death if I hear it one more time. It’s not that I need a relationship to be happy (I swear I’m not desperate), but it’s very tiring to put so much hope and effort into a potential boyfriend and watch it fail miserably every time. Whenever it hasn’t worked out with someone, I’ve always been optimistic that the next one will be the one, that I’m just one step closer to finding what I’ve been looking for. However, after a while you begin to wonder if you’re just wasting your time running in circles looking for something that’s just not there.
My most recent breakup left me the most torn up I’ve felt over any of my past flings. Perhaps it’s because there was something real and it was a lost opportunity, or maybe all of my losses are adding up and starting to take a toll on my emotional stamina. But even still, even after my phases of romantic pessimism, I can’t help but wonder when the next affair will begin and with whom. Maybe I’ll meet someone this week that’ll make me forget the last one, just like how I met my ex when I least expected it. As Fergie said in her song “Fergalicous,” “Boys just come and go like seasons,” and it’s true. This time last year I had a completely different person on my mind than I do now, and this time next year will be even more different.
Whether it’s a one-week stint or a semester-long fling, you have to find a way to enjoy these petty heartbreaks while you’re in college. One day you’ll be settled down, and you’ll look back and laugh at all the times you swore you would end up as a single cat lady.
