No. 1 USC completed its domination of the Pac-12 on Friday night, ending the regular season with a four-set win (24-26, 26-24, 25-21, 25-20) over No. 4 UCLA.
Senior All-American setter Kendall Bateman became USC’s career assists leader in the victory, recording 46 assists to add to her record-breaking total of 4,264.
The win over the Bruins (24-6, 17-5) marked a game in which the Women of Troy (25-4, 20-2) avenged an early-season loss to UCLA in their home conference opener before winning 20 of their next 21 matches.
USC had already clinched the conference title last weekend, but seemed to have plenty of motivation left for the season finale against its cross-town rivals.
Senior All-American outside hitter Alex Jupiter led USC with 18 kills, and junior outside hitter Katie Fuller added a season-high 16 kills.
Senior middle blocker Lauren William chipped in 10 kills while sophomore middle blocker Alexis Olgard posted a season-high six blocks.
Junior Rachel Kidder led the Bruins with 18 kills, but hit just .119 for the match thanks to 13 hitting errors.
USC had a 22-16 lead in the first set, but the Bruins reeled off a 10-2 run to stun the Women of Troy and claim the first set.
UCLA staged a similar comeback in the second set to tie the score at 24-24, but Jupiter and sophomore Sara Shaw prevented another USC collapse by racking up kills in the final two points to claim the second set for the Women of Troy.
Three straight blocks sparked USC to an 8-1 run that gave the team an 18-8 lead in the third set. The Bruins went on yet another late run before serving into the net at 24-21 to hand their rivals a 2-1 lead.
Tied up 17-17 with the Bruins in the fourth set, the Women of Troy took control on a kill from Shaw, and wrapped up the match after a net violation was called on UCLA on the final point.
The victory was USC’s eighth straight, and the squad has now defeated every team in the Pac-12. The Bruins are the only Pac-12 team the Women of Troy didn’t sweep at least once.
Still, the team did receive some disappointing news  Sunday, when the NCAA tournament bracket was released.
Despite receiving 53 of 60 first-place votes in the latest rankings, the Women of Troy were given the No. 7 overall seed in the 64-team bracket.
That potentially sets up a tough quarterfinal matchup against No. 2 seeded Nebraska (24-4), the Big 10 champions.
As one of the top 16 seeds, USC will be able to play its four-team regional at home.
The Women of Troy are slated to play Ivy League champions Yale (18-6) in the first round Friday night at the Galen Center. If they advance, they will play either Tulsa (27-6) or Oklahoma (21-11) in the second round on Saturday night.
Great match at ucla. Trojans got ripped off by ncaa…again…..
#1 team gets #7 seed????
Nebraska is tough.  we beat them at Omaha in ncaa regionals, I believe during elite 8 in Nebraska.
So we can  prevail. It will be difficult road to get to San Antonio for Final Four….but have Faith
Trojan Fans….Coach Mick Haley, his staff, and these amazing players still have a lot to say on who is going to
hold that NCAA Trophy on Dec. 17th.
Fight On!!!
WE R SC!!

USC is 10-2. It holds the best record in the Pac-12 South. In the month of November, it finished 4-0, beating three bowl-eligible teams, as of now, by a combined margin of 170-69.
It’s only natural to ask: How good are these Trojans? Could they beat No. 1 LSU? Or No. 2 Alabama? If given a rematch, would they beat No. 6 Stanford, too?
We won’t know those answers. USC’s season ended — on Nov. 26. — in front of a sellout crowd at the Coliseum. And that’s that.
UCLA, not USC, will travel north to face Oregon in the inaugural Pac-12 championship game at Autzen Stadium. And yes, the Bruins just lost to the Trojans, 50-0.
Is it fair? Not exactly. Is it logical? Perhaps even less so.
“Yes, we should be going to play for the Pac-12 title,” sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey said with a hint of disappointment.
But this type of finish was forecasted in August. The Trojans, serving the second year of a two-year postseason ban, were ineligible for the conference championship game, as well as any bowl game.
That doesn’t make the outcome any less aggravating for fans, or players, or coaches.
USC, a top-10 team, will — as coach Lane Kiffin noted during the post-game press conference — get plenty of “family time” over the next month, now.
Yet, in a somewhat bizarre turn of events, the source of frustration, at least as of now, for many Trojan fans seems to lie with Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott.
A number of cardinal-and-gold backers have taken to the Internet, chastising Scott on a variety of platforms for seemingly barring the Trojans from the first-ever title game. The frustration makes sense. Two teams USC defeated will square off next Friday, and to add insult to injury, a conference official told the Los Angeles Times on Friday that USC can claim first in the South division but it cannot call itself a champion or a co-champion.
Though the second part might still remain a point of contention for many, especially as a number of USC players sported Pac-12 South championship T-shirts in the aftermath of Saturday’s rout, it’s hard to fault the conference entirely.
You can argue Scott should have done more in lobbying the NCAA Infractions Appeal Committee to lift the second year of the bowl ban, sure. In fact, I’d probably say he should have. But once the Trojans’ fate was sealed — its appeal was rejected last May — Scott’s hand was also forced. The options were limited. His hands were tied.
Say USC were to face Oregon on Friday, and in fact take home the conference crown, beating the Ducks for the second time this season. Would that scenario be any less embarrassing for the Pac-12 than sending a hapless UCLA team north? Not necessarily. In several respects, it’d be far more damaging PR-wise: the Pac-12 champion prevented from going to the Rose Bowl. Is that any better?
The fate of the 2011 USC team will always be unbefitting. That’s more than evident now, and will remain so as the years progress.
But Larry Scott was never the source of that — Pac-12 title game or not. At this point, that’s just semantics.
At the end of the day, a nine-person NCAA infractions committee, in June 2010, held the cards and they made sure USC stayed home this winter — for violations committed in 2004 and 2005.
Go figure.
Honestly, the circumstances don’t bother me. Pretty much everyone in the sporting press has either hinted or outright stated that USC won this conference, and that the USC-Oregon game two weeks ago was the real Pac-12 championship. The “title game” between UCLA and the Ducks is a joke and no one outside Westwood or Eugene is going to watch it. In fact I doubt even Oregon fans will tune in. For them, Friday is nothing but a scrimmage to prepare them for the Rose Bowl, with the Bruins being little more than live tackling dummies. The current Vegas spread for the game is 30 points. THIRTY POINTS! Has any Div-1 conference title game EVER had a spread that huge? Give me a break.
It doesn’t matter that we didn’t get the hardware – we won the division by a comfortable margin – we know it, UCLA knows it, the rest of the country knows it, and even Larry Scott knows it.
The NCAA sanctions against USC were pretty heavy considering the infractions–I understand they wanted to “send a message.”  USC and the PAC-12 will just have to live with it.  However, if the NCAA wants to maintain any semblance of credibility they must make sure that any future penalties handed down to other schools are commensurate.  To wit: Ohio State should have their football program disbanded until 2021; Univ. of Miami: they should have to close the ENTIRE UNIVERSITY until 2021; and Penn State: the state of Pennsylvania should be forcibly removed from the union…
Not so fast, John. It is what it is and we Trojans can live with it. I’m surprised to have read this article, for it makes no sense: One cannot dwell on speculation and I feel that most Trojan fans are looking forward to the future. Besides, you should rephrase “USC needs to look in the mirror” to “a few USC fans need to look in the mirror.” That statement would be more accurate.
Of course it would be better for the Trojans to be in the championship game – for them, for the Pac 12 and for college football.  But please don’t blame the infractions committee or Scott.  USC needs to look in the mirror – and has no one to blame but themselves for this mess.  The entire Pac-12 should be upset at them.  
But instead we see what we see so much in life – someone always looking to blame someone else.  Grow up people! 
The Pac-12 will have an ugly championship game – thanks to USC!

In the moments leading up to Saturday’s game against No. 10 USC, UCLA coach Rick Neuheisel insisted that the gap between the two programs had closed.
Provided they could upend the Trojans (10-2, 7-2) in the 81st meeting between the two crosstown rivals, the Bruins would find themselves in first place atop the Pac-12 South standings.
“We’ve got a chance to win the championship, that’s closing the gap,” he said. “We didn’t have a chance in years past.”
Though UCLA will represent the South division Friday in the inaugural Pac-12 championship game against Oregon as USC is ineligible for postseason play, it didn’t necessarily look like a squad headed to a conference title game.
Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
In front of an announced sellout crowd at the Coliseum, USC defeated UCLA, 50-0, to maintain the football pecking order in Los Angeles, despite the optimism Neuheisel had generated since returning to Southern California four years ago.
It was USC’s 12th win in the last 13 meetings against UCLA. It was the most lopsided matchup between the two rivals since 1930 — when USC similarly toppled the Bruins by a score of 52-0.
“It was a pretty strong statement to me,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said of Neuheisel’s remarks. “Our players took that very personally.”
The Trojans established their dominance at the onset and did not let up, scoring on their first four possessions of the game en route to a 29-0 halftime lead.
Headlining USC’s offensive attack, in large part, was junior quarterback Matt Barkley, playing in what could prove to be his final game in a cardinal-and-gold uniform. The third-year signal caller tossed six touchdown passes to break the Pac-12 single-season record for touchdowns with 39 — a mark previously held by former USC quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Matt Leinart.
“I never thought this would happen,” said Barkley, who also threw for 423 yards, completing 35 of 42 passes. “I remember watching him play that year. I kind of dreamed about something like that, but I never thought it would actually happen.”
Barkley’s offensive showing was aided by the play of his wide receivers, freshman Marqise Lee and sophomore Robert Woods, who finished with 224 and 113 receiving yards, respectively, moving each over 1,000 yards on the season, marking just the fourth time in school history a receiving duo had done so.
Woods also broke the single-season Pac-12 record for receptions, finishing with 111 on the season, snapping Keyshawn Johnson’s previously held mark of 102.

“[Woods] was a huge motivation for me,” Lee said. “I knew once I came to ‘SC, I would transition all of my energy into football. My teammates and coaches have helped me a lot.”
Though USC’s offense accomplished a number of milestones against the Bruins, its defense, in several respects, was equally as impressive, recording its first shut out since a 56-0 win over Washington on Nov. 1, 2008 and first over the Bruins since 2001.
The win also marked the Trojans’ 10 of the season, giving it its 25th double-digit win season.
“To win is one thing, but to win like that is something different all together,” Kiffin said. “I’m really excited for our fans and our players.”
