There are more labels being put on the year 2010 than colors in Dennis Rodman’s hair.
According to the Chinese calendar, 2010 is the Year of the Tiger (apparently Mr. Woods didn’t get that message). The Christian Science Monitor says 2010 is the year of the global insurrection (whatever that means). In 1984, Hollywood made a movie titled 2010: The Year We Make Contact (Sam Cassell was born way before 2010). The United Nations declared 2010 to be the International Year of Biodiversity and Time magazine listed 2010 as the Year of the Natural Disaster (Tornado Ron Artest happened in 2004).
I’m here to set the record straight: At USC, 2010 is the Year of the Freshmen.
Recently, the USC athletic department has been all about getting rid of the old and ushering in the new. The school has a new athletic director, new football and baseball coaches, new compliance officers and a new attitude — makes you wonder when the men’s bathroom on the first floor of Heritage Hall is going to receive an upgrade.
But the newest additions to the athletic department are the athletes, and they will be thrust into impact positions and bear more responsibility than any freshman class in recent history.
The football team is an obvious example of this. This team has more question marks than just about any of former head coach Pete Carroll’s teams during the past decade, and most of those questions swirl around positions lacking experienced players. Carroll preferred to let players mature a few years under the system before allowing them to run loose on the Coliseum grass.
Unfortunately, new coach Lane Kiffin has no choice. Because of the exodus of players, Kiffin has been forced to rely on the talent of incoming freshmen. Forget about just one student from the dorms getting a start or significant playing time for the Trojans down in Hawaii; there could be as many as four or five freshmen ­on the field, with possibly more if freshman running back Dillon Baxter hadn’t gone all Tyler Durden of Fight Club and made his own rules.
To begin, there are freshman receivers Kyle Prater and Robert Woods. Other than senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson, those two have the chance to be the biggest threats for sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley. Barkley has stated he feels “really comfortable” working with both of them, and Kiffin has gone so far as to say that Woods could start next Thursday.
Rounding out the impact players on offense is Baxter. For as much trouble as he’s caused off the field, he is a bigger nuisance to defenses on it ­— like a mosquito you keep hearing buzz by your ear but never see. His famous run during spring practice made people instantly compare him to Reggie Bush, but given that the former Heisman Trophy winner is now banned from campus, that might not be a good thing.
So there are three freshmen and a sophomore who could very well find themselves on the field at the same time at some point this year, and that’s just on offense.
On defense, the front line and linebacking corps are stocked with experienced and talented players, but the secondary will see more rookies than the first frat party of the year. True freshman Dion Bailey, who had 10 tackles and an interception in the Trojans’ scrimmage Saturday, has practiced in the starting safety spot while his classmate Nickell Robey is in contention to start at cornerback.
But athletes with meal plans aren’t just making an impact on the gridiron. Across the street, the women’s soccer team — just three years removed from a national championship — started five freshmen in their opener last week. All eyes were on Shelby Church as she stepped between the pipes to fill the decorated shoes of departed goalkeeper Kristin Olsen.
Church did her part, making two saves and allowing just one goal in her debut, but the offense sputtered to a 1-0 defeat. Still, Church’s play will be a huge factor in the Women of Troy’s success this year.
Not to be outdone, the women’s volleyball team welcomed in the No. 1 recruiting class in the nation. Outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana, labeled by some outlets as the best high school player in the country last year, could be the missing link USC needs as it begins its quest for a long-overdue national title. In all, as many as four freshmen could compete for quality minutes on the court.
There you have it. This year, the freshmen class are more than just the hundreds of dining dollars left on their meal plans at the end of the semester. This year, the class of 2014 will make a visible impact on the field and could establish USC’s path to success for the next four years.
For a school and athletic department that’s all about being new, it only seems appropriate for freshmen to play a prominent role.
Still, it wouldn’t hurt to replace the shower curtains with doors on the stalls in the first-floor men’s room.

Despite what you might think, the quarterback position at USC is one that is far from solidified.
The No. 3 quarterback that is.
Handoff · If quarterbacks Matt Barkley and Mitch Mustain (not pictured) are hurt, the Trojans are unsure who would hand the ball off.  Eric Wolfe | Daily Trojan 
With sophomore Matt Barkley and senior Mitch Mustain etched in as the top two quarterbacks, there is little speculation about who will start the game.
The real question lies in who will come in if both those players get hurt.
Freshman running back Dillon Baxter is penciled in to be the third-string quarterback this year for the Trojans. Baxter played quarterback at Mission Bay High School and excelled, passing for more than 1,968 yards and 26 touchdowns last year. But Baxter has been suspended for the first game for violating team rules and will not travel with the team to Hawaii.
Next in line would be freshman quarterback Jesse Scroggins. Unfortunately, Scroggins has yet to be ruled eligible by the NCAA Clearinghouse and hasn’t practiced with the team since his 14-day grace period expired last week.
This is where visibility goes from hazy to oil spill.
Walk-on redshirt sophomores Emon Saee, John Manoogian and Brett Kan — a redshirt sophomore transfer from Princeton — seem to be next in line, but none of them have played on a stage this big before.
Manoogian is the most likely out of those three to win the job even though he has yet to see the field. He’s been on the practice squad for two years and has the most experience with the team.
But don’t forget about redshirt freshman James Boyd, the quarterback converted to defensive end, back to quarterback and finally to defensive end again. Boyd practiced for a few weeks with the quarterbacks in the spring but Kiffin has been adamant about keeping him on the defensive side of the ball.
As for now, the third-string quarterback might as well be Austin Powers — a man of mystery.

Add one more to the injury list.
Linebacker Hayes Pullard, who had been playing with a hurt knee during the past few practices, will have it scoped after an MRI revealed damage Wednesday. USC coach Lane Kiffin said Pullard will likely use his redshirt year this season.
Need more pursuit · While starting linebackers Michael Morgan (center) and Malcolm Smith (right) are healthy, the already-thin depth chart below them just got thinner with the loss of freshman Hayes Pullard to a knee injury. - Eric Wolfe | Daily Trojan 
“Unfortunately [linebacker]’s not a postion very deep with us,” Kiffin said. “We were looking for him to be a backup linebacker and play on our special teams.”
Kiffin said Pullard, a freshman from Inglewood, Calif., would be out for at least four to six weeks and that the chances of him returning to play this season before the  redshirt deadline would be slim.
“It’d be tough to get him back, physically and mentally prepared,” Kiffin said. “It was already going to be tough [with] him being a true freshman.”
The Trojans are thin at just about every position and linebacker is no exception.
The starting linebacking corps seems to be set with sophomore Devon Kennard, senior Malcolm Smith and redshirt senior Michael Morgan. Redshirt junior Chris Galippo, who started last season at middle linebacker, will also see significant time backing up Kennard.
But beyond the starters it’s a little hazy. Redshirt junior Shane Horton started three games last season, recording 30 tackles. Redshirt freshman Marquis Simmons could also contribute but is recovering from an appendectomy. Walk-on junior Ross Cumming, who received a full scholarship Tuesday, could also contribute.
Defections have also hurt the linebacker unit. Uona Kavenga transferred last December. Glen Stanley, a junior college transfer, asked out of his letter of intent after USC was punished by the NCAA.
Of course, Kiffin and the Trojans must go ahead with what they have. But as the injuries pile up, so does the aggravation.
“It’s frustrating, it’s part of it,” Kiffin said. “We can’t change what happens. We can just continue to find ways to manage it.”
Kiffin has limited full contact practice with his squad in hopes of preventing injuries, but the injury bug continues to infect the Trojans.
“It’s gonna happen,” Kiffin said. “But hopefully the majority of the guys get back before the games count eight days from now.”
Other key Trojans slowed by injuries are redshirt sophomore offensive tackle Matt Kalil (hamstring), redshirt sophomore defensive end Nick Perry (ankle) and senior cornerback Shareece Wright (hip).
u
Senior running back Allen Bradford, who many thought would take over as the starting running back after being eclipsed by other running backs last season, is still not counting himself out of the race after redshirt junior Marc Tyler was named the starter earlier in the week.
Bradford is suffering from a knee bruise and said although he is only at about 90 percent strength, he expects to be good to go by Saturday.
“The only thing I can do is just respect the decision and continue to play,” Bradford said.
Although Bradford’s injuries have set him back, his coaches are also looking for more consistency out of the tailback.
Bradford said he was told “it’s nothing that [Tyler’s] gonna be the starter for the whole year, it’s just that this game they feel more comfortable [starting Tyler].”
“I wasn’t as consistent in fall camp,” he said.
Kiffin made it clear he never said Bradford was the starter at the beginning of fall camp. In Kiffin’s eyes, Bradford has acted appropriately.
“I think he responded really well,” Kiffin said.
Bradford has struggled to assert himself in the crowded USC backfield in seasons past, and only got limited opportunities last season.
This season has the potential to be his breakout year if he can stay healthy. The same could be said for Tyler, who has battled injuries throughout his career as well. As of now, Tyler has the upper leg.
“Basically I just looked at myself in the mirror because I know I’ve been through a lot and it’s just another challenge that I have to embrace,” Bradford said.

Around this time last semester, ponies were on campus. Small, fuzzy, nonplussed creatures being paraded down Trousdale Parkway in what became an adorable, non sequitur blitzkrieg of advertising by University Gateway apartments.
Marketers offered free bikes and gift certificates as incentives for early lessors, forgetting in the end students care more about affordable housing than gimmicks.
But moving day has passed. The ponies are gone, replaced instead by a herd of naysayers.
Many students now living in Gateway have voiced complaints that the housing monolith has not lived up to its overly enthusiastic promotion — that rooms appear unfinished, lighting and storage space are scant and promised amenities are absent. In fact, Urban Partners, LLC, the corporation that manages the complex, recently lowered the rent on some apartments to $899, almost $200 lower than the original pricetag, a move that disgruntled some students who thought they had gotten in on the ground floor.
USC simply doesn’t have enough beds, and letting companies like Urban Partners bring housing close to USC is a necessary step to keeping students on campus. But if USC doesn’t closely monitor its outsourced housing, it could find itself in another Conquest Student Housing situation. (In 2009, after numerous student complaints that Conquest — whose properties included Tuscany and Chez Ronnee — had provided subpar services to the student body for several years, USC bought the property with Westar Housing and transferred control to the company.)
If the university won’t provide the beds, it has a duty keep an eye on the operation.
Gateway promised to be an exciting part of USC’s Master Plan. The complex on Figueroa Street and Jefferson Boulevard was touted as the next wave of “luxury” apartments sweeping North University Park — the costly alternative to a long trek home each night. The apartment is providing 1,650 beds to the many students shunted off campus by poor housing lottery numbers, though the original $1,064 price tag for a 12-month lease proved too cost-prohibitive for many.
Much of Gateway’s bluster involved its many advertised amenities. The complex’s buoyant website invites students to “live!, work, play, dine, dance, shop and sweat” — all without venturing outside its red-brick walls. Besides music practice centers, a bevy of restaurants, a Wii game room and what the site describes as an “over-the-top fitness center,” students turned to Gateway for space and proximity.
Instead, according to some residents, they got small, unfinished rooms without ample storage space or lighting, off-site parking and, for some, unresponsive management.
Gateway’s advertising campaign revealed a telling push for aesthetics over function. But students don’t care about ponies or pageantry. They want reasonable housing that lives up to its hefty price tag.
USC officials have said the ultimate goal is to provide guaranteed on-campus housing to students for all four years, but this objective is far from becoming a reality — instead, our alumni dollars will probably be paying for it. For now, the university has the responsibility to heavily police the many units sprouting up around campus, as vigilantly as if they had the Trojan logo on them.
Students shouldn’t have to sacrifice decent housing for proximity, and no amount of advertising can obscure subpar units. Although Gateway may simply be going through a few growing pains, USC should be right there to protect the interests of the student body.

Anyone willing to ay over a grand to share a room, sight unseen, in a building not even built yet is asking for trouble. This is an expensive lesson for them  but bad landlords with shady buildings are noy unique to the USC area but people lining up a year in advance to pay top dollar seem to be.
I fail to see how USC is in any way responsible for this.  It sucks, but all you can do is vote with your dollars and ditch the place when your lease is up. USC can stop allowing them to promote the building or walk ponies around campus, but calling for a takeover after a few months is just absurd.
This article and recent others do offer a valuable degree of needed insight into the housing situation close to campus, but USC can’t exactly police everything that happens. Yes, they had an attractive advertising campaign, etc. etc. but there are an abundance of incompetent/overpriced housing “for students’ in the area that remain unregulated. Should USC start head hunting them, too?
Hi, I dont go to USC, i just work in the area and that was the first thing i asked when deciding to live here. “Is it USC only?” and they said “No” this is NOT a USC dorm, it is not part of USC. it is a regular APARTMENT COMPLEX. I have been treated poorly by many USC students simply because i stated I did not go there. I feel as though i should just tell people I go there and they would be nice. Why does it even matter? Can some one explain why not going to USC suddenly lessons the quality of this building>
THANK YOU!!! Also they are trying to room NON-USC students with USC students since this building is open to everyone now- despite people’s contracts saying you have to be a USC student. We were never informed of this change. The gym is way too small, the rooms are NOT sound proof, parking is ridiculous, the 8th floor is a continuation of frat row, work orders take WAY too long to process, they will come into your apartment without 24 hour written notice, management is incompetent and does not care about you or your problems- once you have signed a lease you may as well not exist to them. No one is going to re-sign their leases next year so they have to really do some kissing of our feet before we can gain any sort of trust or respect from them.

The number 128 is rather unadorned. It does not have the luxury of ending in a 5 or 0, and its three digits don’t form a clever pattern such as lucky No. 111. Nonetheless, at USC, it marks the end of a fantastic four-year journey. Once a student piles up four years’ worth of credits, he can leave USC as a proud graduate of one of the most prestigious institutions in the country.
But what determines how many units a class is given?
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Essentially, classes are assigned a number of units based on what the faculty calls “contact hours” or class time. In order for a course to award its students four units, it must meet a minimum three hours a week.
There are, however, certain courses offered at USC where the units do not reflect the work required of students.
Newswriting: Print (JOUR 202) and Newswriting: Broadcast (JOUR 203), for example, are three-unit courses that meet two hours and 40 minutes a week. Just 20 minutes short of the four-unit mark, these two courses prove to be quite challenging to students — especially considering the fact that the courses require students to hold an internship during each semester.
As many Annenberg students grumble about this injustice, Patricia Dean, the associate director of the School of Journalism, argues that courses in Annenberg will inherently be difficult because they require students to acquire complex technological skills. From scrupulously editing camera footage to putting together stories on deadline, journalism students are expected to be accurate, thorough and fast.
Journalism students, whether or not they know it, sign up for a tough four years. But what about the students with other majors who want to take a journalism course to fulfill a general education requirement or simply rack up some units? They register for two-unit courses expecting an informative but laid-back experience — and often find anything but.
Imre Meszaros, the associate director of the School of Communication, said the aptitude of a given student, not units, often dictates whether the class will be difficult or not; therefore, it is “impossible to achieve exact equivalence across the classes.”
Admittedly, Meszaros has a point: Some students are smarter than others, and it is inevitable that some students will find certain two-unit classes painless and others will not.
But is student variance responsible for the discrepancy between work and units? Perhaps, but the amount of freedom professors enjoy ensures that no two classes are the same.
Unit numbers and even course numbers are almost worthless when one tries to gauge how tough a class will be. Meszaros said faculty can choose how they teach — whether that means having students read four books and write eight papers or requiring only one book and one paper for the same amount of units. Unless the class policy becomes so merciless or so gracious that the university sees the need to intervene, professors do as they please with little surveillance.
Because a class’ difficulty greatly depends on the professor’s style, students usually do not know what they are getting themselves into. This university-wide faculty freedom places serious doubt as to whether units hold any informative value at all.
In this respect, college academia is similar to high school, where the only way to get the inside story about a class is to ask its survivors. In high school, however, there were only two or three teachers who taught the same course. In college, numerous professors teach the same course and the chances that a friend had the same professor are much smaller. To make matters worse, a lot of professors don’t post their syllabi online, so course requirements are often hidden from public view.
So in the end, when faced with registration, students are without the resources they need to make educated decisions regarding what courses to take. Unit labels are unreliable, an updated syllabus is usually not accessible and there is too much inconsistency between professors in the same field. No wonder registration is such a stressful and uncertain time.
With all of these confounding factors, a course’s true difficulty is clouded until the first day of classes. Still, one thing is for sure: Not all units are created equal.

I couldn’t agree more with you lawl. As an engineer, I have more than twice the hours of class per week as some of my friends who somehow get credit for the same number of units. Additionally, many senior year engineering classes are only 2 units, but I guarantee that those classes require more work than these journalism classes that people are complaining about only getting 3 units for.
I’m glad to see the Daily Trojan has started adding some articles for comic effect though!
journalism isn’t the only major with difficult 2 or 3 unit classes .  ever heard of oh pretty much ALL of the engineering majors?  quit complaining about your classes, ya sophomore!

The new, blog-based website for the Undergraduate Student Government is expected to launch early next week.
USG began working on the new site this summer, after its Information Technology Service hardware crashed in late July.
“We had the option of creating a virtual mainframe after the server crashed,” said David Ji, deputy director of technology. “So we saw it as an opportunity to make a better website. We’re making it a little more appealing and modern so that people will visit aside from applying for funding.”
The new website will mirror the old website in terms of linking students to various organizations and resources. However, the new website will be organized in a way that allows those in USG to easily access and change it.
“Honestly, I think that people go to websites so much and expect to find out everything you need from just a website,” said Elizabeth Trower, senior director of communications. “While our office makes us pretty accessible, I think that students want to be able to access what they want, when they want.”
Though the website will be online in the coming days, it will take some additional time for the details to be finished,  Trower said.
However, the forms for funding, questions, comments and suggestions will be available when the website is launched. Trower also said the website will be blog-based and contain tabs for different links for easy navigation.
“We want to make our communication much more engaging,” said Maya Babla, USG chief of staff. “We want to make it easier to engage with USG as a regular student who isn’t involved with the organization, just so you know what’s going on on campus.”

The USC Office of Admission has declared the class of 2014 the university’s best class to date.
Officials said the pool of students applying for college is growing more competitive each year, which — combined with USC’s active recruitment — molded the class of 2014.
“We have been moving the university’s academic profile consistently and getting more and more competitive,” said Tim Brunold, dean of admissions. “We have been able to successfully recruit the most sought after students in the country.”
The average SAT score for the class of 2014 increased 10 points, placing the average score in the 96th percentile.
“While the demographics of the [freshman] class are very similar [to previous years], the quality certainly continues to increase, and that is a long-term trend,” Brunold said.
Though the 24 percent acceptance rate is similar to last year, the size of the freshman class increased by about 100 students to 2,963.
Forty-six percent of the freshmen are male and 54 percent are female, which generally does not change from year to year, Brunold said.
“We’re not as out of balance for the freshman class as some of our competitors,” he said.
Yet, the gender statistic supports the national trend of more women attending college than men. Although this is of great concern, Brunold said, overall USC has almost an exact gender balance university-wide.
“We want to make sure that USC’s student body reflects the diversity out in the world,” Brunold said. “USC is continuing to work on increasing the diversity of students from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds and make strides in ethnic diversity.”
Typically, underrepresented racial groups increased their presence in the freshman class this year: 7.3 percent of students are African-American, which increased from 7 percent last year; and 13.3 percent of students are Latino, which increased from 12.8 percent.
Though there are about 300 freshmen students from outside the United States, the international population of the freshman class decreased from 11 percent to 10 percent this year. Of those students, 40 countries are represented, with most students originating from China, Canada and South Korea.
Demographic diversity within the United States is increasing, however, with most out-of-state freshmen students hailing from Texas, Illinois, New York and Washington. The class of 2014 represents 48 of the 50 states; no freshmen students hail from Mississippi or North Dakota.
As the out-of-state freshmen population increases, the percentage of incoming students who went to high school in California has steadily decreased over the past five years. This year, 52 percent of the class is from California.
The admission center plans to continue recruiting students by increasing its number of high school visits next year, Brunold said. Representatives from the Office of Admission visited 1,400 high schools while recruiting the class of 2014 — about a 50 percent increase from the previous year.
Though the statistics of the class of 2014 will not become official until the third week of classes, Brunold said the numbers are not expected to vary greatly.

The student-run radio station formerly known as KSCR underwent a name change this fall, becoming KXSC and moving to a new location in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Listen up · Students Ada Lee and Barry Levine run a show at the new KXSC station in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. - James Watson | Daily Trojan 
The name change wasn’t planned, but rather the result of a redundancy with a commercial station in the Pacific Northwest.
“It was tough,” General Manager Karl Nickenig said. “We’ve had the name for decades, but I honestly don’t think it could have come at a better time.”
Nickenig, a senior majoring in music industry and formerly the station’s chief engineer, assumed general manager duties in January and has overseen the station’s transition to a new studio, located in the basement of the campus center.
“It signifies a new opportunity,” Nickenig said. “The studios are state of the art and our broadcast quality will be the best it ever has.”
But beyond the new name, location and equipment, Nickenig said KXSC will be characterized by its commitment to community and student enrichment.
KXSC is not funded by the university and receives most of its budget from public support. It will kick off the new semester with a private event for donors, volunteers and close supporters today and will feature an open house to allow students to tour the new studio in the coming month.
Originally when USC’s campus radio station, then titled KUSC, launched in 1946, the radio station was one of only a handful of college stations in the country. It gained widespread acclaim and support until it moved off campus to become the classical music station it is today.
KUSC left in its wake a demand for new student-run content. In 1975, KSCR was founded with the goal of promoting and providing just that: music for USC students — and often by USC students. Now, KSCR is KXSC.
The promotion of local bands, including those with students or alumni, is what students say they like most about the station.
“I usually listen when they feature live groups,” said Katherine Lee, a junior majoring in biological sciences. “Last year, one of my friends was performing and it was just great to be able to hear them on the air.”
Among those featured in the past and on tap for this year are Saint Motel and Mississippi Man, which have received airtime on commercial stations on the West Coast.
“In terms of listenership, our biggest nights are always our live shows on Fridays,” Nickenig said of the station, which will feature local bands at Tommy’s Place.
The station isn’t all about music, however. It features a sports department and works with the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism to broadcast Annenberg Radio News.

The first week of school is always exciting. Classes are full, faces are smiling and first impressions are being made, whether you realize it or not.
“Don’t judge a book by its cover” is a hard mantra to abide by, especially when everything is new — from the school year to the campus to the students. Sometimes you can’t help but take first impressions with a grain of salt.
My first journalism class Monday reminded me that not only am I feeling out my new professors and classes but they are also getting a sense of me as a student. In this case, my professor had already done his homework. He passed back a published article written by each of my classmates after he had copy edited it himself. My classmates and I shared a nervous giggle before blushing over our published mistakes.
In reality, once he received the class roster, all he had to do was type our names into Google form his first impressions of us. I Googled myself later that night and realized the article he chose of mine did not show up on Google’s first page of hits. He probably sifted through the links for my Facebook, Twitter (which is not private), where I went to high school, my time from a cross-country meet ages ago and more before finding the article and before meeting me.
Scary.
He chuckled as he explained he would not be using anything against us, and the class breathed a sigh of relief. But then again, what will stop him from judging us?
What’s scarier is he isn’t the only person to Google my name. He is just the only person who told me he did.
Just as companies use Google to find incriminating details about potential employees, professors are using Google to “get to know” their students. And all they have to do is type in your name. Employers often take background screenings even further by checking popular college gossip sites such as Collegeacb.com.
So it’s the student’s own responsibility to protect themselves, and there is no time like the first week of school — full of first impressions in-person and online — to clean up online reputations. No one should be pre-judged simply by Internet content, but it is today’s reality. And what is online can make or break futures.
First of all, students should make an effort to take down pictures on Facebook, Flickr and other websites they would not want their bosses or other figures of authority to see.
Pictures are the most incriminating form of evidence next to videos, so it’s important to make sure any picture posted in public doesn’t show anything people are not legally able to do.
If the photos from last Friday’s party are “too epic” to be buried in a personal photo library, there is a solution.
Social media users can use a new resource called The Fridge. Offering a format similar to Facebook, the site allows members to post statuses and photos. The plus side is that only private groups can view the materials and comment or “heart,” Fridge’s version of Facebook’s “like.”
Creating a group is simple. All you have to do is access the home page (thefridge.org). Then enter your e-mail address, name your group and share the group’s private URL with your friends. Each Fridge user gets a profile, but the only way to discover a user is through joint or mutual groups.
So there is now a time and place for suggestive pictures. According to a Mashable.com article, Fridge representatives drove its core message home by presenting a picture of a guy smoking a bong he had masterfully created out of a Nintendo 64 controller. Although this photo could cause trouble on Facebook, uploading it to a private Fridge group would ensure laughter and applause from buddies and relief from potential penalties.
My favorite part of The Fridge is the ability to post new content to the group simply by e-mailing the group’s custom e-mail address with whatever it is you want to post. Also, have no fear — this social network will not require a front-page application space on your phone because there is no mobile application for The Fridge up to now.
College is the time for fun and enjoying the last days of minimal responsibility, but careless actions can take a toll on students’ futures.
Though it proves difficult to control rumors and gossip that surface online via others, it is possible to control what belongs to you and has your name on it. What others say about you online is going to affect your reputation a lot less than the material you post yourself, so make sure anything you post is professional and tasteful.
The first month of school involves interviews, Greek recruitment, club and organizations, scholarship applications and more. First impressions have never been more important. The Internet is the new first impression, so rock it.

Hip-hop, still one of the most dominant forms of music, has now existed for more than 30 years. The genre is filled with pioneers, legends and early innovators as well as plenty of young up-and-coming artists influenced and inspired by the genre’s forefathers. Both the legends and rising stars were represented at the Echoplex on Tuesday night, as rappers Kendrick Lamar and Freddie Gibbs opened for GZA, the famous Wu-Tang Clan lyricist.
Drop a beat · Hip-hop artist Freddie Gibbs performs tracks from his mixtapes and comments on his real reason for moving to Los Angeles. - Will Hagle | Daily Trojan 
It took a while for the small club to fill up before Compton native Lamar took the stage. Noticing the somewhat weak crowd, the rapper sarcastically quipped, “I love the intimate shows.” As soon as Lamar demonstrated his rapid-fire flow and confident stage presence, however, his words seemed believable.
Lamar ended his 20-minute set with a guest appearance by promising local rapper Jay Rock. Interestingly enough, this collaboration of rising artists helped improve Lamar’s otherwise relatively average performance.
As Lamar left the stage, the crowd swelled in size. It was a diverse audience filled with everyone from the guys who cheered when Lamar gave a shout-out to his hometown to Echo Park hipsters.
Surprisingly, much of this crowd’s attention was focused on second opener Gibbs. One member of the audience even said he “loves GZA but came to see Freddie Gibbs.”
Gibbs, a Los Angeles resident via Gary, Ind., recently received praise from popular indie music site Pitchfork as well as hip-hop publications including XXL Magazine. The magazine featured Gibbs and Jay Rock on this year’s prestigious “Freshman 10” list, a compilation of newly successful hip-hop artists.
It’s no wonder then that the diverse crowd was impressively enthusiastic about Gibbs’ performance.
On stage, Gibbs was highly energetic, powering through songs off his mixtapes like “Slammin’” and “National Anthem.” While on stage, the rapper was also not shy about expressing his affection for marijuana,  even claiming the plant is “the reason [he] moved to L.A.”
With numerous songs about the struggles of living in the harsh ghetto of his Midwestern hometown, it’s likely there were a few other reasons for Gibbs’ move to the West Coast.
After Gibbs left the stage and the wait for GZA drew on, the crowd’s energy began to dwindle.
As soon as the legendary Wu-Tang rhymer emerged from backstage and grabbed the mic, no one cared about the long wait anymore.
Although GZA had a low-key and laid-back stage presence in comparison to his more youthful and energetic opening acts, there was still no question that the MC is a veteran performer. He remained calm and collected yet captivating and commanding. After maintaining an influential presence in the hip-hop community for nearly 20 years, this is only to be expected by GZA. The rapper could probably simply show up on stage without performing and still be well-received and respected.
GZA, of course, did not just show up — he ran through his prolific catalogue full of complex lyrics impeccably, pausing between songs only briefly. Accompanied by Clan affiliate Killa Priest and members from the group Black Knights, GZA performed Wu-Tang classics such as “Reunited,” among a few others. GZA also performed several classics off his critically acclaimed 1995 album Liquid Swords, including “Duel of the Iron Mic,” “Shadowboxin’” and the crowd-pleasing title track. Plenty of the group’s signature hand “W”s could be seen held high throughout the crowd.
With a mid-set shout-out to fallen Wu-Tang member ODB as well as opening acts Lamar and Gibbs, GZA explained that true legends never really die. After witnessing GZA’s entertaining set filled with classic songs off classic albums, there’s no doubt that GZA will live on as a legend himself.

With the heat wave finally over and the weekend soon upon us, how does watching Wes Anderson’s Rushmore atop a Downtown parking garage sound? A little unusual, probably, but that’s the charm of Devil’s Night Drive In, one of Los Angeles’ more unique film venues.

To find a classic drive-in near Los Angeles, you need to commute 17 miles east to the City of Industry’s Vineland Drive-In Movie Theater — a long trek for a little nostalgia. But once per month (twice during summer), Devil’s Night offers the fond memories and fun, car hops included, just 10 minutes from campus.
Founder Morgan Higby Night began Devil’s Night in 2007 as the event Angel City Drive-In.
“I’m a big fan of the [Hollywood Forever] Cemetery screenings and drive-in movies — kind of ‘retro’ culture in general — as well as Downtown,” Night said. “Those three things combined made me think of doing it.”
He held the first three screenings in a parking lot next to The Alexandria hotel on Sixth and Main streets, and quickly decided to find a new location.
“It was in a transition between being a crack house and a nice apartment building and we’d have people throwing their trash out the window on our patrons,” Night said. “They just didn’t want us there.”
Finding an ideal location for the Devil’s Night Drive In proved difficult. Night needed an open space large enough to fit the 24-foot inflatable screen and the audience as well as easy access to electricity. Those features also attract  competitors from a different branch of the film industry — production teams ­­— ones that often book lots at the last minute and can pay more for them.
On the corners of West Fourth Street and South Broadway, Night discovered a two-story parking garage with a clearance poorly suited for production trucks — the perfect spot for a Downtown drive-in.
“My favorite thing about the lot that we’re at now is just the fact that we’re on a roof, so there’s no distractions from the street downstairs,” Night said. “You don’t get people watching it from on the street. It’s really private.  I can’t imagine doing it anywhere else.”
Devil’s Night Drive In mostly caters to cult films, like Evil Dead or The Big Lebowski, though that doesn’t limit the selection. Past films include romances (Say Anything), so-bad-they-are-good laughers (Showgirls), classics both old (Rear Window) and new (Pulp Fiction), as well as family-friendly films (Big).
Night even occasionally takes suggestions from the audience, one of which, The Dark Side of Oz — a version of The Wizard of Oz with Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of The Moon played over it — became a personal favorite.
“I never thought people would go for that, but they chose it and it was really cool to see it like that,” Night said.
Each screening costs $10, while designated family-friendly films cost $5. As a bonus, buying a presold ticket to one of the screenings guarantees a parking spot on the rooftop, where an FM transmitter broadcasts the movie’s soundtrack into your car.
Drive-in fans who miss the presale deadline or decide to go at the last minute can purchase a walk-in ticket at the gate. The entire downstairs of the garage doubles as parking for walk-ins, who can then picnic in the Astroturf section and listen to the movie through speakers.
Unlike most movie theatres, the food options at the drive-in are easier on moviegoers’ wallets. For just $6, Devil’s Night Drive In’s “Chef Boyardouche” grills specialty burgers for each screening, like Showgirl’s “Saved by the Bell Burger” and Up in Smoke’s “Cheech and Chong Burger.” Nachos, hot dogs, candy and soda run cheaper than concessions at other theaters and so moviegoers don’t miss anything, car hops come by on roller skates when you flash your lights to help with refills.
But the best bit comes post-picture. At the end of the show, after enjoying a unique, retro, affordable movie night, attendees do not have to wander a vast parking lot trying to remember where they left their car.
Devil’s Night Drive-In is located at 240 West Fourth Street in Downtown Los Angeles. Doors open Saturday at 8 p.m. for a screening of Rushmore. Visit www.devilsnight.com/drivein.htm for more information and a schedule of screenings.

USC’s increase in its number of international offices is starting to pay off. Not only has the number of Chinese student undergraduates grown at this university, but the nation has also felt the surge. In just five years, the number of Chinese undergraduates attending U.S. universities has grown nearly 60 percent, although this influx might be the result of professional sports-like marketing.
A new report by InsideHigherEd.com found that agents are often used to bring international students to U.S. universities, operating as a middleman between the student and the university. Much like the relationship between an athlete about to enter a professional league and his agent, these middlemen work on commission to promote the best possible “client.”
The report discussed a survey among four U.S. schools — Grinnell College, Iowa State, Fort Hays State and USC — and five Chinese high schools; more than 60 percent of the polled high school students said they planned to use such agents, whereas 50 percent of Chinese college students said they had used them.
Agents have “raised educators concerns” according to a USC report as the agent’s fees are usually collected by from both the student and the institution, and the results are tangible. In the 2004-2005 school year, about 8,300 students from China enrolled in American universities. Today that number is close to 30,000.

Earlier this month, former Villanova and Duke forward Taylor King announced his intent to transfer to USC. According to several confirmed Internet reports and a statement by a USC basketball spokesperson however, King will not be playing for the Trojans this year.
When he was 15, King announced he would play basketball for UCLA but ended up signing with Duke, and then left the Blue Devils for Villanova. The 22-year-old King left Villanova reportedly because of a violation of team rules. The question now remains as to what his basketball career will look like now that he has decided against transferring to USC to play ball. It is unclear whether he will attend another Division 1 school, look toward another division or continue playing basketball.
Although USC could not offer him a basketball scholarship immediately, he could have received one the following season when he would have been eligible to play, in accordance with NCAA transfer rules. King would have been considered a walk-on to the team had he transferred.
The 220-pound, 6-foot-6-inch forward averaged 7.4 points and 5.3 rebounds per game last season, as well as bagging 36.4 percent of the shots he made from behind the arc.
King is originally from Orange County and attended Mater Dei High School, a school known for its acclaimed basketball and football programs. His decision not to return to Southern California and play for USC brings up a lot of questions, but only time will tell what the basketball player’s next steps will be.

Less than 1 percent of students who buy tuition insurance at USC actually find need for the security, according to a recent article in the Wall Street Journal.
About 10,000 students, or about one-third of the USC student body, decide to buy insurance for their tuition at the beginning of the year, according to the article. The USC insurance provides a refund of tuition and fees to students who must withdraw from classes because of illness or injury.
At USC, it costs $123 to insure tuition that costs about $40,000 a year for 16 units of class. The university contracts A.W.G. Dewar, Inc. to handle the insurance. Among those who buy insurance at USC, a very small percentage actually find need for the coverage.
The reasons that students can file a claim for a refund aren’t that broad, however, according to Dewar. Students cannot claim tuition refund for simply skipping class, leaving because of drug use or self-inflicted injury, or unhospitalized mental illness.
Students usually opt for tuition insurance when registering for classes, but have until the end of the third week of class to buy the insurance at the beginning of every semester, according to the USC Office of Academic Records and Registrar.

The first X-Men film directed by USC alum Bryan Singer premiered in 2000, followed by X2: X-Men United in 2003 and X-Men: The Last Stand in 2006, directed by Brett Ratner. The series of sequels then ended and gave way to the prequel X-Men Origins: Wolverine, directed by Gavin Hood. The first three films focused on the evolution and formation of the X-Men and the obstacles they faced. X-Men Origins: Wolverine, as the title suggests, focuses on the story of Wolverine and how he became the silently angry mutant of the other films.
If you own a 2011 calendar already, mark June as the fated month for the newest X-men film release. Another dose of the mutant phenomena will hit theatres in the form of yet another prequel, X-Men: First Class. This time the story follows mutants living back in the 1960s. The flick will introduce a host of other mutants and will focus on the story of mutant mentor Professor X and the foremost villain Magneto. The film, therefore, will venture further into the history of X-men, showing the meeting of Professor X and Magneto and the events that lead up to the formation of the first X-men crew.
The new prequel will feature some prominent stars including Kevin Bacon and Mad Men star January Jones. Though it does not hit theaters until a year from now, the story carries so much weight that fans yearn for details as early as possible. For now, fans can only hope the the combination of clever casting and the strength of the main characters in the film will be enough to make it yet another solid addition to the X-men film legacy.
