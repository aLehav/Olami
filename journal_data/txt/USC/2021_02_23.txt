USC players were well aware of senior guard Tahj Eaddy’s hot hand, it was hard to miss when he started off the game by hitting three consecutive 3-pointers. From there on out, it was about getting the ball in his hands, and he didn’t let them down.
Eaddy dropped 21 points in the first half, just one less than the entire Oregon team. His scoring output propelled the Trojans to a 43-22 first-half advantage, a lead they would hold through the rest of the game to defeat the Ducks 72-58 at Galen Center Monday night.
“We’re just showing that we’re one of the best teams in the country,” Eaddy said in a virtual press conference Monday night. “We feel like we let one slip against Arizona. We just wanted to let teams know that you can’t bully us, anything like that. We’re just showing that we’re fighters, and we’re not gonna give in like that.”
In many ways, it was a perfect bounce-back win for No. 17 USC, who was coming off of its first loss in eight games against Arizona on Saturday. Eaddy finished the game with 24 and junior guard Drew Peterson had 15 points off of the bench.  
“Our players really were focused,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “They understood, once they saw some of the video from Saturday’s game, we were outplayed by a very good Arizona team, and they just didn’t want that to happen again tonight.” 
The Trojans went without sophomore forward Isaiah Mobley, who is day-to-day with a strained calf muscle, allowing them to embrace more of a small-ball approach, something which the team isn’t usually known for. This ended up being an adequate counter to Oregon’s full-court-press defense.   
“We had to adjust our lineup a little bit,” Enfield said. “We went small … but our forwards and our guards did a really good job rebounding and defending. We were able to play with an extra ball handler to break their press and to spread the floor offensively.” 
Another change to the lineup saw Peterson, who had previously struggled, come off of the bench. He still played 36 minutes and filled up the stat sheet along with his 15 points, grabbing 11 boards, assisting four times and getting two steals. 
“Especially coming off the bench woke me up a little bit,” Peterson said. “I’ve been shooting poor, and I lost a little bit of confidence. I just came into the game trying to do a little bit of everything. When I’m getting rebounds and assists like that it helps me get my shot to fall, and I’m in a better rhythm out there.”
Oregon, notorious for its 3-point-shooting ability, took a little too long to get warmed up, falling behind early in the first half. It took the Ducks just over eight minutes of play to make their first field goal. They found their feet in the second half though, staying within striking distance and cutting the deficit to just 10 at one point.
“We knew they would go on a run eventually, and they went on a few runs,” Enfield said. “We were able to withstand that toward the end of the game. Oregon’s an exceptional basketball team. So you’re not gonna hold them down the whole game, and to hold [them] to 58 points is a credit to our defense.” 
Enfield’s team was preparing to face Stanford before the Pac-12 changed their schedule last Thursday, giving the Trojans just one day to prepare for the Ducks following their game Saturday against Arizona. 
“It’s hard to prepare for [Oregon] in one day because of their unique style in the match-up zone and full-court pressure,” Enfield said. “I thought our players did a terrific job of paying attention to the scouting report. They played very hard tonight, and I’m very proud of them and the way they responded on short notice.”
USC moved to 19-4 on the season and 13-3 in conference play, and have a chance to win a regular season conference title for the first time since the 1984-85 season. 
“We control our own destiny,” Eaddy said. “We have a tough road ahead. We’re just trying to make the most of our opportunities. Every game is important at this point; we’re treating it like we’re in March Madness already.”
The team is set for a tough matchup on the road against Colorado Thursday night. Tip-off is at 6 p.m..

After a trip to China last year, Kelly Yu, a filmmaker and sophomore majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, was inspired to write “a love letter to family, heritage, and identity.” Yu has since started the production of her new short film “Plum Town,” which follows the story of a young man who returns to China to convince his father to sell his family’s plum orchard. 
The film follows Xiao Li, a young land developer, who returns to the countryside outside of Shanghai for the first time in decades. His father, Old Li, is still holding onto tradition in the form of their family’s plum orchard that Xiao Li wants him to sell.
“I grew up with just such a melting pot of cultures,” Yu said. “My parents raised me to speak fluent Chinese because they were very passionate about that. And so I grew up kind of tiptoeing between the lines of China and America. I think that it raises a lot of questions about, not only new versus old, but also tradition versus change, and it also made me think about the disconnect I’ve had with my heritage and my culture.”
The film is based on her own story; for generations, her family farmed corn in the Chinese countryside. When Yu visited last summer, she discovered the farmland that had previously surrounded them had been replaced by a factory.
“There are people like my grandpa, who, you know, it symbolizes our history or family’s history, and part of that is being erased,” Yu said.
Yu said that one of the main reasons why she’s creating this short film is to bring awareness to how many local farming communities are being affected by large-scale developments like factories. Though the story explores the contrasting ideas of new and old, it also serves as a reminder of the traditions that are being stripped away. 
The original idea for the story began with a single logline — “Game of Thrones” but with Chinese farmers. Yu’s first screenplay came from this logline: a story about three feuding farming dynasties warring over land. But when it came to fruition, she said the story didn’t feel personal enough.
“I couldn’t just continue and this idea just kept like knocking on the door, and kept coming back. And so I was like OK, I’m just going to do it, I’m just going to see where this takes me. And it eventually evolved into a 110-page script,” Yu said.
After workshopping the script with her mentor, Yu submitted her work to The Black List, a filmmaker’s organization that allows writers to upload their unproduced screenplays and be critiqued by professionals in the industry. According to Yu, it’s known for its “really brutal scores.” Despite its usual harshness, Yu managed to score an outstanding nine out of 10, gaining a fair amount of traction for the work. 
But even with successes like these, there are always challenges. The team mentioned the difficulty of planning during the coronavirus pandemic, especially when trying to pass off Southern California for rural China because of travel restrictions. Yu also talked about the difficulty of being a writer and having the weight of comparison by people you look up to because of the competitive nature of the film world. 
“Even when you get notes back, like the most wonderful people that I send my work to give me feedback, that I agree with, that I respect,” Yu said. “But it’s still that feeling you get when they point out that something is not good.”
Yu also said that, while the film gained a lot of attention after The Black List’s score, there were still times when self-doubt was the biggest challenge.
“I got an opportunity to have a really respected lit manager read my script. And I was so excited, and I was like ‘oh my gosh like this is it.’ And he replied and said it wasn’t for him, and for the longest time, that made me doubt everything.” Yu said, “But it’s also very collaborative. I mean, like, the best thing about being at SCA is my amazing classmates who have always read my stuff and have taken the time to read draft after draft. And you like can’t find that anywhere else.”
Despite the challenges filmmakers often face, whether it be external or internal criticism, she also expresses undeniable enthusiasm for her community and especially for her team.
While Yu originally wrote the story as a feature screenplay, the team is now producing a short film as a proof-of-concept with a number of School of Cinematic Arts collaborators. The team currently consists of three other members: Jean Liu, a graduate student studying producing for film, television and new media, who is acting as her producer, and SCA sophomores Jonathan Chan and Thomas Kim as co-producers. 
Liu was formerly an investment analyst in London but chose to move to China to pursue a career in filmmaking; afterward, Liu began working on documentaries before making her way to USC’s Peter Stark Producing Program. Liu said she was originally drawn to Yu’s work because she herself has spent a lot of time in the Chinese countryside. 
Liu said “Plum Town” maintains the vibrant culture that’s often overlooked by global politics, and that she recognized the China that she knew in the story. She also said seeing her team members be young and enthusiastic is one of her favorite parts of working on this film; she appreciates their hard work and, as a director, the clear idea Yu has for her film.
Chan, one of the co-producers, is currently interning with 87North Productions and previously worked at Orion Pictures at MGM. Chan said he originally got involved with “Plum Town” after Yu mentioned her writing of the draft during his freshman year. After the project began picking up, Chan continued to help develop the material with Yu, and eventually took on the role of co-producer. 
“I feel that when anytime a film can shed a light on something that’s real and connected into a fictional narrative, it just really entices me,” Chan said. “There’s a lot of emotion; the characters go through a really strong arc … There are always conflicts in [family dynamics] because of [the] generational gap. And this film explores that generational gap.”
He said his favorite part so far has been working with Yu on her script, as well as the development of characters. Both Chan and Kim mentioned their enthusiasm for the casting process, especially when considering the father-son dynamic presented throughout the film.
Kim, the third producer of “Plum Town,” became roped in the project after seeing Yu’s feature screenplay and reaching out to her. Kim previously worked on “Si,” a proof-of-concept he’s developing into a feature film. He was one of the first to convince Yu to create the short film as a proof-of-concept to exhibit its feasibility and was largely drawn to the project for a similar reason as Liu; the story considers many serious concepts but is still laced with comedy.
“And that’s what we’re all believing in — rooting for — Kelly and the team … The project is just an extension of the people,” Kim said. 
He trusts Yu’s vision; like the rest of the team, the project surrounds Yu’s ideas, but also her enthusiasm and her own motivation. 
Together the team is looking to start production this year, though they said much of their planning is currently hypothetical since they still don’t know if they’ll be able to raise a budget.
“Filmmaking is so expensive, and it involves so many people,” Yu said. “And if you think about it, writing is the only thing that is free to a filmmaker and is accessible, and that’s what I love about it.”
To follow the production and progress of the film, check out the “Plum Town” Instagram account and support the project by contributing to their Kickstarter campaign.

Meeting as random roommates during their freshman year, Helen Sohn and Jessica Pan made the transition from high school to college together. As they navigated their first year together, they realized that USC lacked a space specifically focused on mental health student mentorship for new Trojans to make the adjustment to navigating adulthood in the new environment of college together. 
To address this need, the pair founded the GIVE Foundation this semester, a content creation-based club that compiles mental health resources in an accessible online platform. The leadership team chooses three themes each semester, such as this semester’s themes of lifestyle, relief and self-love, for their members to focus on, and the members are divided into different teams to create podcasts, blog posts and other forms of media. The GIVE website also features an anonymous post section where users can confess about an issue they’re struggling with to help students realize that they are not alone. 
“Our club is mostly content-based, so it’s not like where people have to actively invest in something to get something out of it … You don’t have to raise a flag and say, ‘Oh, my God, I need counseling, I need help,’” said Sohn, a sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention. “It’s just something that anyone can click on our website or look at our social media and take a look at what seems interesting and figure out what they could benefit from.” 
Something that makes GIVE unique compared to other publications about mental health is the club’s emphasis on the positive ways people mitigate stress. 
“Through sharing their personal stories, we don’t want to be stressing, ‘Oh, like college students are experiencing alcohol abuse, like substance abuse, like people are depressed’… we want to be a club that stresses that … college students have the ability to go through these very difficult times through the help of us and our community,” said Pan, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience. 
As pre-health students, Sohn and Pan both recognized the amount of intense academic work and extracurriculars that students of all majors, but pre-health and pre-law students in particular struggle with. Growing up in competitive school environments before entering college, the duo also felt that mental health was an issue that needed to be addressed at USC, especially after hearing about a lot of students who died by suicide in the beginning of their freshman semester. 
“In high school, we had a couple of students struggle with like mental health issues like depression and eating disorders, and we’ve actually had students [die by suicide], and one thing that helped some students get back on their feet was, we had an anonymous confessions page,” Sohn said. “And I think [having that at USC] would help students realize that they’re not alone in this process. I feel like a lot of students who definitely have to come from out of state or don’t have older siblings to help guide them through that transition could definitely benefit from that.”
GIVE’s structure of dividing members into content-creating teams also helps foster an “intimate environment” to make friends and connect with each other online while still learning something new about mental health. 
“We’re so thankful for each other, even members,” Sohn said. “We’ve all been helping each other with the process of getting registered and starting promotions and figuring out how to structure our club because we didn’t want to be the organization that stresses people out when we’re trying to talk about stress.” 
GIVE’s goal of sharing advice and mental health resources was aided by the coronavirus pandemic and the onset of quarantine, due to a higher emphasis on the importance of mental health.  
“During the pandemic, you just have so much more time to yourself … and I think that kind of makes people face what they’ve been struggling with,” Sohn said. “Especially because everything’s online every day, it feels like the same routine, and you’re questioning yourself like, ‘Why? Why am I doing this? Why is this happening?’”
One of GIVE’s most active members is Maggie Lee, a sophomore majoring in business administration and NGOs and social change, who runs a mental-health focused podcast available on GIVE’s website titled, “It’s Growing Season.” Lee’s podcast began as a personal project, but after members of GIVE’s executive board invited her to share her podcast on GIVE, she decided to join the team. Lee said she always wanted a platform to share her opinions and self-growth journey, and when she recognized that her strongest form of expression is through speech, starting a podcast seemed like the natural next step.
“What I love about GIVE is that we just want to be here for you,” Lee said. “We just want you to feel like you’re supported, and my goal is just to reach as many people as possible. One hundred people could listen, but what means the most to me is if two people really really resonate with it and start to feel like it had an impact on them.”
Lee began by sharing her close friends’ stories of self-growth and is now extending her reach to people around the world with different backgrounds, such as disability awareness activists, relationship coaches and spiritual teachers. While “It’s Growing Season” covers a variety of topics surrounding mental health, Lee is most passionate about normalizing the conversation about body love. 
“Body positivity is something that I really struggled with since middle school, and I feel like this is a topic that is very important and needs to be addressed because so many young people, especially young girls [and] teenagers who are so easily influenced by social media,” Lee said. “[Young girls and teenagers are] developing eating disorders … and they take whatever they see on social media as truth. I saw people on the internet who were really positive influences in my life, so I want to be that person for someone else.” 
Although Lee promotes her podcast on social media, a major source of mental health issues, she believes that curating one’s social media feed is an important way to combat the impact of online negativity on one’s personal life.
“If you feel bad about yourself after scrolling through Instagram, I feel like that means something’s wrong with your feed,” Lee said. “I think it’s perfectly healthy to mute people, to unfollow people, so you can protect your own mental health first, and I think having more body positive and people talking more about mental health on social media kind of combats that ratio, makes this more of a prominent thing on social media, so that more people are seeing that positive cycle.”  
Ultimately, GIVE aims to be a mindfulness resource collection not only for people to refer back to but also for researchers pursuing careers in the mental health profession. Pan has been reaching out to individuals outside of USC to contribute to GIVE’s mental health resources as well.
“I think what we hope to do with our platform — it’s a way to ground yourself in reality but also kind of come to terms with how the world is right now,” Sohn said. “Know that we have a community where you can figure out what you need help with and kind of connect with other people who might have something to share and help you with.”

No matter the cultural arena, Black designers continue to define the fashion industry. Inspired by art, sports, immigrant experiences and much more, fashion is an art form that connects the Black diaspora. Because of the long-standing influence and impact Black creators have had within the industry, you should be supporting Black-owned fashion brands before and after Black History Month. Reflecting the amalgamation of affinities, ethnicities, ethos and interests Black designers have, these six fashion brands are the perfect way to close out Black History Month with style. 
“Tia Adeola” by Tia Adeola
Tia Adeola has been worn by the likes of SZA, Kali Uchis, Flo Milli and many more. The 24-year-old launched her eponymous label while pursuing an undergraduate culture and media degree at The New School. With designs that almost look like they were pulled out of a high school AP European History textbook, it’s obvious she’s put the degree to use.
The brand, formerly known as SlashedbyTia, is known for its Renaissance-inspired designs and is largely informed by Adeola’s passion for art history. The Nigerian-born and United Kingdom-raised designer indulges in her interests while grappling with the marginalized Black people who appear in European art as slaves or jesters. Paying tribute to these people, Adeola decided to launch a company that explored Renaissance muses and society, while showcasing Black women in elements previously reserved for white women. Her vision gave life to a combination that puts the Sistine Chapel to shame and is now her signature: Black women in ruffles.
“Hardies Hardware” by Tyshawn Jones
Skate culture and fashion have become almost inseparable, even apart from streetwear. While most skaters dream of securing a sponsorship with one of the industry’s top brands (this is where I’m obligated to mention Supreme), Tyshawn Jones, 2018’s Thrasher Skater of the Year, decided to become the brand with Hardies Hardware.
Hardies began as a facetious concept amongst Jones’ friends from skate crew Illegal Civilization — a hardware store that also sells clothing — but launched as a collaboration with friend Na-kel Smith in 2014. The brand now provides a mix of tees, knit pullovers and — staying true to its identity as a skate company — cruiser decks. However, it’s Hardies’ classic NYC trucker hat that’s most worth buying. The tribute to Jones’ hometown reflects his efforts to maintain east coast representation in a sport that’s too often associated with the west coast.
“MATTE Brand” by Briana Wilson
“I like to show real women in the clothes so that real women will buy them,” said Briana Wilson.
Wilson, founder of “MATTE,” approaches her designs with a commitment to minimalism and realism. The 24-year-old designer launched the brand in 2014 with simple bodysuits modeled by non-agency models. Her most recent Fall/Winter “1992” collection offers strappy sets, mini-skirts and cropped crocodile jackets in taupe and chocolate nudes. Wilson hasn’t strayed from her roots, however. Her “MATTE FRAME” collection features body-hugging loungewear and sweaters. Wilson’s sleek and straightforward design ethos reminds us that style can be comfortable and that simple is sexy. 
“Asata Maisé” by Asata Maisé
Whether it’s jeans, tops or cardigans, patchwork designs have inundated the fast fashion industry for months. Needless to say, the trend has grown tired. However, Asata Maisé’s patchworked shoulder bags are the perfect spin to revive the craze.
The corporate alumna of Diane von Furstenberg came across the formula for her eponymous label after looking for a sustainable way to refresh the classic ’90s silhouette. Her choice to repurpose vintage denim fabrics into shoulder bags isn’t only great for the environment, it’s resulted in colorful one-of-kind, hand-crafted pieces. With an Asata Maisé purchase, you’ll look fabulous while taking comfort in the fact that you’ve reduced waste. And more importantly, no one can jack your style!
“Telfar” by Telfar Clemens
Odds are anyone with an internet presence has heard of Telfar. The brand especially gained mainstream acclaim after last summer’s calls for social change prompted consumers to spend money with Black-owned brands. This movement, combined with increased bot usage on the site and unanticipated demand, resulted in scarcity. Suddenly countless social media posts pining over the classic shopping bag went viral. Most recently, Telfar has announced collaborations with Converse and Gap.
It’s hard to believe the viral brand is the same one Telfar Clemens — a Liberian American raised primarily in Queens, New York — launched in 2005 with a simple shopping bag. The bag was initially popularized amongst queer and Black youth in Brooklyn, but resellers have made it harder for the original audience to secure the product. Recognizing the sudden scarcity, Clemens launched a pre-order program in August, intending to curb any ideas of exclusivity surrounding the bag. 
As Clemens takes a stand against resellers, he stays true to Telfar’s motto: “Not for you — for everyone.” Telfar’s efforts to keep the bag accessible have prompted the industry to envision an idea of luxury that doesn’t involve elitism or exclusion. As the proud owner of an olive-green Telfar medium shopping bag, I can assure you that (if you can snag one) the impeccably designed and extremely sturdy product is well worth the investment!
“Phlemuns” by James Flemons
Many have characterized Phlemuns, founded by James Flemons, as a fashion company for the future. It’s true the genderless label proved that fashion doesn’t have to adhere to the gender binary, but Flemons isn’t designing for the future. He’s building a timeless legacy by pulling from the past: “I treat the clothes as these timeless stamps that will last,” Flemons shares in an interview with SSENSE. “It’s like I’m leaving breadcrumbs of myself that will exist forever.” 
Flemons creates these timeless pieces by analyzing the Black art and fashion of the last century. The designer especially admires gender-fluid elements of African American fashion of the ’70s, and his 2017 denim capsule sourced denim entirely from thrift stores. The company’s appeal isn’t its constant evolution, but Flemons’ ability to recognize which elements of the past will speak to today’s audiences.

When Sanat Mohapatra was a freshman at Dartmouth College, he noticed many of his peers were utilizing online forums to talk about mental health. Through this, he realized there was a need for an anonymous platform dedicated specifically to discussing mental health issues concerning students. To remedy this problem, Mohapatra launched an app, Unmasked. 
“I realized there’s a need for an anonymous platform that was way more focused on mental health specifically because students weren’t always getting the best responses on existing platforms,” said Mohapatra, who now serves as the app’s CEO. Since Mohapatra began outlining the app’s plans almost four years ago, Unmasked has spread across the country, including to USC, where it launched mid-February. 
The app provides a platform for students to openly talk about their mental health. By allowing students to post comments and directly message others, the app fosters a support network while maintaining the anonymity people may desire when it comes to discussing sensitive issues. 
Unmasked’s founders wanted to narrow their app’s focus specifically to mental health, considering how discussions of mental health are often met with stigma.
“The focus with Unmasked was to bring out that side of the anonymous community and make it much more supportive for people that may feel hesitant to reach out in public, reach out to friends because of the stigma surrounding mental health,” said Jun Tsuru, Unmasked’s chief operating officer. “Unmasked was tailored as a supportive anonymous community for that demographic.”
Paloma Chavez, a senior majoring in journalism and president of Unmasked at USC, initially learned about the app through a friend at Dartmouth. After reflecting on her own struggles with on-campus counseling services and a general trend in mental health issues among her peers, Chavez recognized a need for a protective support system like Unmasked for the USC community.
“A lot of kids our age, whether they’re a freshman and they’re just starting now, or me, I’m 22, have struggled with something,” Chavez said. “The scale doesn’t really exist because it’s all relative to you, and there’s no hierarchy of what is worse. I’ve really noticed at USC that so many kids, my friends and myself included, act like everything’s okay when it’s really not.” 
After getting in touch with Tsuru through her friend, Chavez presented the idea of bringing the app to USC last August. She then worked to assemble a team of students in October to finalize the platform’s launch. 
“We interviewed people, [and] they’re all USC students … and we got a team together,” Chavez said. “Now it’s more submarketing the app and spreading the word for people to use it.” 
Mohapatra collaborated with student volunteers from Dartmouth’s DALI Lab, a space for students to create apps, websites and digital reality projects to design the platform. After developing its initial prototype, Unmasked was finalized and launched in early 2020. 
With a design reminiscent of traditional social media apps, Unmasked forms communities within colleges, maintaining message boards that allow students to interact with classmates. Each campus’ version of Unmasked is run by students of that college. Since its release, it has amassed around 9,000 active users across 45 college campuses, including UCLA and Princeton University. 
Because the app is run by students of a certain college campus, specifically for their own classmates, there emerges a level of community and understanding specific to their platform.
“It creates this really nice sense of camaraderie and unity with your peers,” Chavez said. She referred to Tsuru’s description of the app, summing it up as, “the best friend who’s always there, who never judges you.” 
Shelbi Woodard, a sophomore majoring in business administration, is a growth marketer on USC’s team. Woodward said that while the app is continually disseminating and attracting new users, their focus lies in a much more simple goal.
“We care more about getting the app in the hands of people who need it and are going to use it,” Woodard said. “We’re definitely very intentional with where we’re marketing it and how we’re marketing it.”
As Unmasked expands to more college campuses around the country, the app has received positive feedback from users, with some citing how different aspects of the app — from supportive comments to DMs, conversations and more — profoundly helped them.
“I think we’ve seen a lot of testimonials that are really heartwarming [and] reminds me what a blessing [it is] that we can be helping people out like this,” Tsuru said.
In the future, Mohapatra hopes to expand the app’s reach to an all-school message board to allow students to mingle between colleges. Additionally, Chavez spoke about introducing Unmasked in other spaces like workplaces, emphasizing the fact that mental health issues can persist beyond college.
“The first step to Unmasked is unmasking that persona or facade that you’ve put on throughout the day and telling people how you really feel … and just creating a sense of normalcy,” Chavez said. “With Unmasked, teaching everyone that, ‘I’m feeling the same way, you’re not alone, and I’m here for you whenever you need me,’ creates a lot less scary of a conversation.”

Films Reflecting Ourselves, otherwise known as FRO Fest, went live Feb. 17, showcasing Black writers, producers, directors and actors at USC. The event, which served as a platform for Black students’ stories to be shared and celebrated, was put together by the Center for Black Cultural Student Affairs, USC Fisher Museum of Art and the School of Cinematic Arts. 
As a result of the coronavirus, the 2021 FRO Fest theme was “Creating Art During COVID.” A Zoom livestream was held to showcase creators’ work to those attending. The selected films showcased Black excellence and creativity while navigating the lifelong challenges of marginalization as well as the recent coronavirus pandemic. 
Chance Davis, a senior majoring in film production, submitted his film, “A Dream Recurred,” to FRO Fest. This was his first year participating in the event.
“For me, it’s a really cool space where we get to showcase, share and learn from Black students at USC,” Davis said. “I thought it was really cool to have this space where our work can be highlighted and I had a ton of fun watching what was on display.” 
Although Davis has been studying from home, he is passionate about stop motion animation and has a studio and camera set up at his house. With the help of his parents, he created costumes, a set for his film, and recorded the entirety of the piece from home. 
Davis’ inspiration came from the song “Mr. Sandman” by The Chordettes. Davis listened to the song on loop while writing his script and visualized how he planned to go about the film.
“I spontaneously had the idea while I was listening to this song,” Davis said. “In the song, these women are asking Mr. Sandman to bring them a dream guy. I was thinking how people are asking America to bring us a dream and right now that’s not working.”
For Davis, his film was about the way the American dream has failed in a multitude of ways. This is particularly shown by the character navigating the intersection of feelings and isolation associated with the pandemic, quarantine, the news and how the pandemic had exacerbated an array of societal issues. 
Davis’ film was a very personal way for him to cope with his emotions and loneliness.
“I was feeling the loneliness from quarantine, combined with the stress of seeing police brutalities, the Capitol riot and having Donald Trump inciting problems was really affecting me,” Davis said. “And so for me, this was just a creative outlet for all that negative energy I wanted to turn into something that was an art piece that could give people something to think about.”
Davis initially struggled to get creative ideas for films and scripts because he usually pulled inspiration from doing activities and seeing his friends. However, FRO Fest created a unique opportunity for him to get creative about his experience within the last year and share it with others in the community. 
Miki Turner, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, worked with a group of students who presented their film, “Two Paths, One Direction” at FRO Fest. 
“I think for filmmakers, it gives them feedback,” Turner said. “They need to either move forward or in some cases go back in and fix some things based on the feedback. And I think it’s just cool for our students to be a part of something with sensitivity.”  
Turner saw the way in which students used FRO Fest to share their own personal visions and reflect on the complexity of the time, particularly as a result of the pandemic.
“I hope that someday they’ll be able to really utilize some of the bigger screening rooms on campus and expand the festival so that it becomes a huge success,” Turner said.
C. Craig Patterson is a graduate student in his last semester studying cinematic arts, film and television production. Patterson directed the film “Alone Together” with Dylan Filingeri, the writer and co-producer and Ayana McKnight, co-producer. It painted a portrait of a family dealing with the fact that their grandmother was alone in a long-term care facility as a result of the pandemic. 
“The central meaning of the film was togetherness,” Patterson said. “To understand what we mean to one another, especially in a time when we were taken from one of them.”
The film itself was created fully virtually, and it was actually an autobiographical story about Filingeri’s family. One of the toughest parts of the creation process for the team was that after finishing the film, his grandmother passed away due to complications from the coronavirus. 
Although the film had to be adjusted to virtual production, the team readjusted as well in order to produce a film for the event and share their message.
“The success is kind of measured in the fact that we were able to make it together,” Patterson said. “Everybody was so happy that we hit that finish line. And I’m grateful that I had that experience with them.” 
The FRO Fest event provided a unique opportunity for Patterson and his team to not only have an audience, but also viewers who were receptive and understanding of the position they were all in.
“It’s beautiful,” Patterson said. “Anytime you get a chance to do filmmaking, especially at the level that you are at before you really authenticate your career, it can be a pretty lonely endeavor to share your work with people. It’s great to be able to share with people who got it and it was well received. I mean that’s all you could ever ask for.”
FRO Fest and the pandemic pushed the team to use their creativity and bring together their community through art, all while supporting and sharing with the Black community.
“It’s important to me, simply because of the people that come together for it,” Patterson said. “I think any program that brings together people from our community and shows them things that are beautiful about the community is important to have. So I’m grateful that they do it.”

The MLB absolutely has a parity problem. Leaguewide competitiveness seems to be unusually low, with massive discrepancies in team salaries ridding some fans of hope before the season starts. For an example of the massive gap in investment, fans should look no further than the difference between the spending habits of the Pittsburgh Pirates and Los Angeles Dodgers this offseason. 
The Dodgers, reigning World Series champions and perpetual luxury tax payers, signed four players to contracts worth more than $2.6 million in average salary, according to Spotrac. The defending champions also added one of the offseason’s biggest free agent prizes, starting pitcher Trevor Bauer. Bauer’s deal with the Dodgers is for three seasons, and he will be paid an MLB all-time single season record of $40 million this season alone. This comes less than one season after the Dodgers signed outfielder Mookie Betts to a 12-year contract worth roughly $365 million.
An absurd demonstration of wealth? Surely. Especially during a global pandemic, and after laying off nearly 50 employees after citing budget concerns. Nonetheless, while the Dodgers field a 26-man roster due nearly $230 million in combined salary this season, fans of the Pirates are expected to get excited about a team with a combined salary of $34 million, with a prize free agent signing on a maximum salary of $1.5 million this season. 
Yes, you read that right. The Dodgers’ prized signing Bauer will make more money than the entire 26-man Pittsburgh Pirates roster this season. To make matters worse, Pirates owner Bob Nutting and company did essentially nothing to improve their bottom-dwelling roster from last season. In the shortened 2020 season, the Pirates won just 32% of their games, compared to the Dodgers’ mark of 72%. 
For those who aren’t familiar with American professional sports, bad teams usually spend the offseason remedying depleted rosters while highly successful teams, like the Dodgers, spend the offseason making up for inevitable player departures. Instead, the rich have gotten richer, and the gap in competitiveness continues to grow. 
Ultimately, the MLB and commissioner Rob Manfred must hold franchise owners accountable for their lack of spending. The idea of implementing a salary cap in order to deter teams like the Dodgers, New York Yankees and others from excessive spending isn’t misguided. However, without a minimum salary floor, situations like that with Nutting and the Pirates will persist. 
As recently as 2017, Nutting was estimated to have a net worth exceeding $1 billion. Admittedly, net worth is not fully liquid and much of Nutting’s wealth is likely tied to assets and properties. But the reality is, for someone as financially affluent as Nutting to invest so little into an organization over an extended period of time with little to no repercussion, fans should be concerned about the viability of baseball as a mainstay in sports viewership in future years. While a high payroll doesn’t necessarily directly translate to on-field success, it definitely helps. 
Nine teams are set to have a 26-man payroll of $150 million or higher in the 2021 season. On the other hand, five teams are currently paying less than $50 million combined for their 26-man roster. This is not a sustainable business model. If the gap between the teams at the top of spending and teams at the bottom of the list continues to widen, the MLB can surely expect the exodus of fans to continue. 
With more owners adopting Nutting’s minimal spending strategy, a concept accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic, those at the league office need to act quickly to regain balance within the league. It should be noted, however, that league revenue is shared among owners. Essentially, the revenue allocated for owners taken in by the Dodgers and Yankees is placed into the same pot as the revenue of less-popular teams, and split evenly among the league’s 30 owners. Thus, if the majority of owners are content with receiving their portion of the profit share despite their own team fielding a poor roster, then the league is in a sticky situation. 
Ultimately the owners would have to vote to institute a salary floor, and if the majority of owners become comfortable with the concept of minimizing personal costs and leeching off the “blue-blood” franchises’ revenue, then league administrators would find it difficult to increase minimum roster investment. 
If the MLB institutes a salary floor like the NFL, the lack of competitiveness and fair compensation for the league’s less competitive rosters would at least be partially corrected. As a result, with more teams in contention to sign top players, teams like the Dodgers and Yankees would be unable to dominate the free market as they do now.

Outrage does not properly encapsulate the feelings of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. From spitting to stabbing, a whole damning spectra of attacks has been propagated against older AAPI adults. The death of Vicha Ratanapakdee, the assault of Lee-Lee Chin-Yeung and the slashing of Noel Quintana are some of the attacks in recent months, which have been a part of the increase in AAPI-related attacks. 
These attacks upon AAPI members are an inexcusable reminder of the senseless violence that continues to drive this country into its own fallout — no questions asked. Many more are not covered by the news or media, but I encourage you to read into the reports released by Stop AAPI Hate.
Older adults of all races and creeds are attacked on a daily basis, albeit not always physically. They are perceived as vulnerable, making them more susceptible to financial scams, and as less likely to speak up if mistreated. 
While there is prominent legislation protecting the rights of older adults in terms of financial or physical abuse and neglect, it has been made clear in recent months that simply not enough has been done. President Joe Biden’s acknowledgement of xenophobia in the United States in his most recent executive order has minimally opened the conversation as well. Additionally, it has yet to be seen whether the creation of ‘special response units’ would deter the rates of race-related violence against Asian Americans.
It is community-led efforts that have been the only saving grace — from assisting older adults in attaining vaccination appointments to walking with older adults from place to place. 
So, let’s take a step back. 
“Have we genuinely lost our minds?” you, the inquisitive reader, asks. “It seems that the world continues to devolve into sheer madness by the day. But, to be fair, now we see that there’s plenty of advocacy going on on behalf of older adults.”
And that’s all great and dandy; I genuinely find some of the infographics that I stumble upon on Instagram to be occasionally helpful. But I hope that the conversation on these issues goes in the right direction. 
The right direction isn’t infantilizing older adults; again, they are fully functioning human beings that are going through the natural course of life. Additionally, while xenophobia and the model minority myth should be tackled through open discussion, I hope that the conversation also opens up and takes on the ageist rhetoric that we are often used to.
As an Asian American, I am already frustrated with the advocacy that has taken months to come to fruition. These racially charged attacks have occurred since the beginning of the pandemic and, frankly, long before it.
As a gerontologist, it truly pains me to see the treatment of older adults who are presently in the most vulnerable state when it pertains to the coronavirus pandemic, with the vaccine or without. I’ve written about the issues that older individuals have faced time and time again, and they continue to be under attack. But just as a human being, it tears my soul to see that this is what the world has come to.
Sadly, as with many of these controversial issues, it seems that a complete overhaul of the system is necessary to get everyone on the same page of compassion and respect. 
However, it is essential that with the time we have now we push for legislation and policies that further the protection of our older adult population. The justice system has certainly failed the AAPI population in more ways than one, but the proper repercussions must be brought down upon those who choose to vehemently oppose the law and disrespect their fellow community members. The fact that our own University has not voiced concern for its AAPI students, faculty and staff with such recent attacks is a clear demonstration of blissful ignorance. 
All of us know that these unprecedented attacks hurt the unity of minority communities in the United States, and pushes for reconciliation have certainly been futile as well. But we need to recognize that, older adults or not, individuals are being assaulted and scapegoated for events they’re not responsible for. 
Moving forward, we need to also demonstrate support for local, community-led initiatives that look out for the safety of vulnerable individuals at any capacity. Participating in phone chains and chatting with someone for a few minutes can truly make a difference in someone’s day when given serious consideration. Helping neighbors get groceries or advocating for vulnerable groups are also perfectly acceptable ways of working through this pandemic. 
And while the saying goes that “history repeats itself,” maybe one day we can reflect back as we live in a future where things turned for the better, thinking, “Back in my day…”
