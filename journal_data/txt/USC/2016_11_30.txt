While his parents are citizens now, they came to the United States as undocumented immigrants, and he said that the stories they told him of lost childhood and immigration motivated him to work hard to get into USC. But he recognizes that many other Chicano, working-class, first-generation college students are not able to do the same.
Photo from USC NewsRhode to success · Oscar de los Santos, who graduated from USC in 2015 with a degree in political science, was awarded the Rhodes Scholarship.
“[My parents] gave up their families, friends and everything they knew to go to a country that did not want them, and whose language they did not speak,” Santos wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “They made these courageous sacrifices to give their kids a chance at breaking the cycle of intergenerational poverty each of their families had faced in Mexico. I have a responsibility to make this country’s investment in me meaningful for my community.”
Santos, who graduated from USC in 2015 with a bachelor’s degree in political science, was named one of 32 Americans to receive the Rhodes Scholarship, which provides financial support for two to four years of graduate study at Oxford University. Erica McCann, director of USC Academic Honors and Fellowships, said this is no small feat, as the scholarship is recognized as one of the world’s most prestigious postgraduate awards.
“Oscar is USC’s ninth Rhodes Scholar and is among the ranks of other prominent members of the Trojan Family, including Marshall School of Business professor James O’Toole and former USC Athletic Director Pat Haden,” McCann said. “All USC Rhodes Scholars are celebrated on the Wall of Scholars in Leavey Library, a gift from the Skull and Dagger Society.”
All Rhodes Scholar candidates must be endorsed by their universities, and each university has a unique endorsement process, according to McCann. USC does not limit the number of students it can choose to endorse. Applicants submit a number of materials, including application, personal statement, resume and five to eight letters of recommendation for faculty consideration.
While Santos was at USC, he was a member of the USC College Democrats and helped found USC Students for Barack Obama. He was also a member of Sigma Delta Alpha, a multicultural fraternity. Santos graduated from USC as a Truman Scholar, Phi Beta Kappa and with the Order of the Laurel and Palm. Despite these accomplishments, he said that when he was notified that he was selected as a Rhodes Scholar, his first thought was of his larger community.
“I had mixed emotions. I was excited, obviously, but I was also disappointed to find out I was the only Latino Rhodes Scholar this year,” Santos wrote. “I remain disappointed that powerful institutions continue to underestimate and marginalize the talents of people of color.”
Santos explained that he currently sees troubling societal issues and wishes to educate himself in order to have a positive effect on his community.
“The big issues we face today — education inequity, mass deportation, mass incarceration, poverty, hunger — we face them not because we lack solutions or strategies to address them,” Santos wrote. “We face these issues because we lack moral urgency to confront them. So as somebody who wants to become a better advocate and more effective organizer, I want to pursue a degree in public policy while also developing a more thoughtful moral vision that recognizes the dignity and humanity of all people through a degree in Christian ethics.”
Many of Santos’ mentors reacted excitedly to the news. Chris Freeman, a professor of English at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, said that Santos had the potential to create change in the world by pursuing a higher education. Santos was part of Freeman’s “Queer Los Angeles” class, and Freeman remembered Santos as a student who was on “his own level.”
“When you are competing for something of that level, you are against the very best people in the country,” Freeman said. “So for him to have been chosen is just an incredible honor and when he gets to Oxford, he will make a mark. He will make an impression. And he will do USC very proud. That’s for sure.”
McCann said Santos has always aimed to become an agent of change in his community, and that he saw the Rhodes Scholarship as a vehicle for bettering the lives of others.
“When [Santos] inquired about applying for the Rhodes [Scholarship], he was already incredibly accomplished in his own right, [and] we were glad to partner [with] him to highlight [his] achievements,” McCann said. “Throughout [the process], Oscar remained humble and focused on the work he hopes to accomplish for his community. With the Rhodes [Scholarship], he gains an international platform to support his advocacy.”
Perhaps Oscar will set the example for others, especially int’l students because being one isn’t easy, given our complex culture and language. Assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on life’s journey. Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow students, and even informative books to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.
   One such new award-winning worldwide book/ebook that reaches out to help anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they’ve contributed to our society, including students.  
   A chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture, friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work with/for an American firm here or overseas. 
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here. 
   Good luck to all at USC or wherever you study!
And what about the candidate who’s parents are the in the country legally?  He’s shunned in favor of someone who’s parents are still here illegally.  What a disgrace!

Provost Michael Quick discussed USC’s support for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and the University’s undocumented immigrant students in an email statement sent to students, faculty and staff on Wednesday.
Regardless of the new presidential administration, he wrote, all students will be provided with a safe learning environment.
“We are all members of the Trojan Family, [and] we will remain committed to each other and to our shared values of diversity, equity, and inclusion,” Quick wrote.
Quick reiterated that USC will comply with all laws. Students will not be searched without a warrant, the Department of Public Safety will not take action against students based on their immigration status and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act will continue to keep student records private if student consent or a judicial order are not provided.
Two committees have been formed to assist with USC’s response to further changes in immigration policy: the Provost’s Advisory Task Force on Immigration Issues and the Deans’ Steering Committee on Immigration.
In addition, the USC Center for Immigrant Integration will organize town hall meetings to share viewpoints on immigration and immigrant integration. The USC Gould School of Law Immigration Clinic will also provide campus training on DACA-specific issues. Such opportunities touching upon the impact of the recent presidential election will continue next semester.
“Ultimately, our values define us as a university community, and we will remain steadfast in our belief that everyone should have access to higher education and that we have a critical role to play as a preeminent private university focused on the public good,” Quick wrote.
I do hope that the University, as well as Provost Quick, understand that USC does not set immigration law or policy.  Nor does the Provost’s Task Force, the Dean’s Steering Committee, or Gould’s Immigration Clinic.  Congress determines immigration law.  Presidents have some discretion in terms of policy and enforcement.  President-Elect Trump has been clear that he intends to enforce immigration law more fairly than President Obama, whose approach fostered two classes of immigrants in our country:  Those who came here illegally and for whom the law has been broadly waived and ignored …and those who came here legally for whom the law has been applied clearly and in full.  By establishing this double standard, the Obama administration also created uncertainty by placing hundreds if not thousands of students (particularly in California) in a precarious position because, of course, his temporary reprieve was just that – temporary!  Trump has signaled that he will return to a policy that enforces immigration law clearly, fairly and equitably upon everyone.
USC’s position as articulated by Quick is troublesome at best as it affirms these two separate classes of immigrants on campus.  I am a first generation immigrant, and alumnus of USC.  I was required to complete additional paperwork and provide documentation of my immigration status at every stage of my time as a student.  I’m not sure why things would be any different today, unless perhaps Hispanic immigrants are simply not required to follow the same law and policy as white or European immigrants.  I’d rather believe that the University would apply existing immigration law equitably across its entire student body, in accordance with existing law set by Congress.
Finally, let’s be very clear:  The United States has some of the most generous and welcoming immigration policy of any nation in the world.  There is nothing onerous about our immigration laws.  Our nation welcome thousands and thousands of legal immigrants successfully every year.  And for some perspective, the overwhelming majority of new immigrants each year are Hispanic or Latino, many of whom are of modest means, so the idea that Hispanics and Latinos complain and protest the most is ironic and shameful.

As it becomes time for many — fans, analysts, coaches and players — to reflect on the past football season, it also becomes time for me to reflect on not only the past football season but also the last year, as my tenure as the sports editor of the Daily Trojan has come to an end.
It’s been a wild ride fraught with some of the craziest and most unbelievable events I could have imagined prior to taking this job, but as I have come to find out, even the most crazy and unbelievable become just another day on the job at USC.
There have been success stories unlike any other, national championships and undefeated seasons. These are what, hopefully, I’ll be able to remember as I look back years from now on what I covered while at USC. The football team is always going to be the most impressive beat to put on a resume, and though in the future they may have national championship hopes, there are other teams who have been significantly more successful this season, namely men’s and women’s water polo, beach volleyball, lacrosse and soccer.
I have also gotten to be a part of a turning point in USC sports culture, a time when students are (relatively) excited about basketball. In addition to boasting a nearly perfect record at home, the basketball team also made their first NCAA tournament in five years and plays one of the most exciting styles in the country.
I came in at a good time in USC sports culture — lots of teams were up-and-coming — despite the drama that happened nearly every week on the football field. There have been some dramatic — and not in a good way — situations at practice, at games and even at fundraisers, and this year looked to be no different until the team had an about-face and made their season one all my friends are jealous that I get to cover.
Working with USC athletics has taught me a lot about the business of sport. I’ve come to realize through my classes and my time working that sports is just that — a business. It’s a wonderfully dizzying business that keeps you on your toes and keeps you engaged with your work; and just when you think you’re getting the hang of it, it manages to throw you a curveball you never saw coming.
I’m very thankful for the work. It’s not only allowed me to grow as a journalist and a person, but has also allowed me to experience some of the coolest sporting events this school has participated in, including this year’s football game in Arlington against Alabama and the games in Utah and Seattle.
As exciting as it is to be a fan right now (my dad spends far too much time every day keeping up with potential recruits and practice recaps), it is even more special to be able to go to school at this time and be a part of what appears to be beginning of a historic ride for USC football.
As this football season winds to a close, I hope that everyone who wants to has been able to experience a thoroughly entertaining and uplifting season that has left everyone in the Trojan Family with a hopeful outlook on the future. Being a student while the team “struggled” through average seasons — by USC’s standards — makes it so much more worthwhile when things finally start looking up. Hopefully with most of that drama behind the program, I will be able to enjoy one more blissfully successful USC season next year — a year when all the talks of Rose Bowl games, College Football Playoffs and Heisman hopefuls seem to be very valid.
The culture around USC sports is getting back to being a national powerhouse and that makes slogging through the previous years as a student feeling a little bit slighted about the lack of positive publicity worth it.
Regardless of where the team finishes this year, the season will be considered a success because of the rough beginning to the year; and next year, though expectations will be high, there finally seems to be the proper infrastructure in place to follow through on those high goals. There isn’t a better time to get to not only cover USC, but also be a fan of the Trojans. And isn’t that what sports is all about? Well, no, in college sports it’s pretty much all about winning, but at least for me, I’ve enjoyed this turbulent yet exciting ride.

The men’s water polo team will travel to the Spieker Aquatics Complex in Berkeley, Calif. this Saturday as the No. 1 team in the country to play in the semifinals of the 2016 NCAA tournament.
With their MPSF championship game victory over crosstown rival UCLA last week, the Trojans (23-1) earned the top seed in the NCAA tournament and will battle the winner of the quarterfinal contest between the No. 10 Harvard Crimson (26-6) and No. 8 UC Davis Aggies (23-5).
Anvay Ullal | Daily TrojanRegular participants · Junior driver Blake Edwards and the Trojans will aim for a 12th consecutive appearance in the NCAA championship match.
The Men of Troy, with just one loss this entire season, are favored going into an opposing field loaded with UCLA, Cal or Pomona-Pitzer waiting for the Trojans in the championship game.
“We definitely think we’re going to win it all. Every single game we go into, we have a firm belief that we can win,” junior driver Blake Edwards said. “This year, we’re really excited and we’ve shown a lot of maturity as a team this season. There’s a much higher expectation that we’re going to go all the way.”
Before Troy can win its 10th title in the past 20 years, it will have to overcome the powerful arms of either UC Davis or Harvard.
Despite playing only hours away from each other, USC and UC Davis have not played a single game this season against each other and will be meeting for the first time since September 2014 when the Trojans scorched the Aggies 19-3.
Speaking of long absences, USC hasn’t seen Harvard since Oct. 5, 2002, when the Trojans bested the Crimson 14-6 in the semifinals in the Nor-Cal Tournament.
On the other hand, both Harvard and UC Davis have squabbled this season, splitting the season series with a win apiece.
The fact that USC has not faced neither Harvard nor UC Davis at all this season, however, presents a disadvantage for both teams in that their scouting and preparation will be based solely on statistics and footage instead of in-pool play.
“Obviously, we have to be cautious of both of those teams. They’re both are going to be really excited to play in a tournament game. But, our coaches are world class and have really prepared us well for them,” Edwards said. “It doesn’t really make us nervous that we haven’t played them before. We’ll be prepared for them like anyone else.”
Fresh off its first conference title since 1997, UC Davis brings to the table a talented offense led by sophomore Ido Goldschmidt, who has scored 45 goals and racked up 41 assists on the year, earning him Wester Water Polo Player of the Year honors.
In goal for the Aggies is tested junior Spencer Creed, who has 221 stops this season to go along with 12 wins against ranked opponents.
A key for the Men of Troy will be to limit UC Davis on the powerplay as the Aggies have converted at a 54.1 percent clip, while allowing goals on just four of their past 25 man disadvantages.
If the Crimson, fresh off a thrilling 13-12 sudden-death overtime victory over Bucknell, defeat the Aggies in the play-in game, they could certainly bring a momentum that could be hard for the Trojans to stop.
In Harvard’s fifth straight win last Saturday, senior Dan Stevens netted a hat trick and contributed two assists to bring his season tally to 32 goals and 21 assists.
However, a proper analysis of Harvard’s offense wouldn’t be complete without mentioning one of the nation’s best talents in senior Noah Harrison, who has racked up 81 goals, 35 assists and 56 steals.
Harrison will help alleviate any defensive burden that sophomore goaltender Anthony Ridgley will face from the Trojans this weekend.
Against either team, the Trojans will have their hands full.
But, thanks to the help of MPSF Coach of the Year Jovan Vavic, USC has the opportunity to compete in its 12th-straight NCAA Championship game and potentially win its seventh title in 10 consecutive seasons.
Edwards and freshman Marin Dasic agree that the team owes its success to the longtime head coach.
“[Vavic] has done it all. The way he prepares for every practice and every game is amazing,” Dasic said. “All of the hard work he puts in and how dedicated he is to this program is something that we should be proud of because we have a coach that is the best coach of the century. He hasn’t been this successful by accident.”

The women’s soccer team heads to San Jose this week for the start of the College Cup, the final two rounds of the NCAA tournament. The No. 7 Women of Troy are among the final four teams standing — winning at home against Eastern Washington, Utah, Texas A&M and Auburn in their earlier ties — and they will face No. 5 Georgetown on Friday for a berth in the championship game.
The semifinal against the Hoyas will mark just the second time in program history that USC has competed in the College Cup. The first time came in 2007, when the Women of Troy defeated Florida State in the final to win the National Championship, which remains their only title to date. Finally back in the Cup now, USC will look to make it two-for-two this weekend.
The Women of Troy played their final home game of the season last Friday, edging Auburn 1-0 in the quarterfinals. But after playing to a stellar 10-1-1 mark at McAlister Field in 2016, they will now have to leave their friendly confines for their final match (or matches) of the season. Thankfully for them, Avaya Stadium is only a 350-mile-or-so trip from the USC campus. The Hoyas, on the other hand, will have to fly cross-country to attend the Final Four.
The Women of Troy will certainly hope the travel slows Georgetown down. Head coach Keidane McAlpine praised the Hoyas’ sharpness on both offense and defense, calling them “the best of both worlds.”
“We’re going to have to be on our game for sure,” he said. “They’re on a great run. They bought in and made history, so their energy is way up.”
Indeed, Georgetown is in the midst of a very impressive year, having earned its first-ever appearance in the College Cup. Key matches during the regular season included the  double-overtime victory over current No. 1 West Virginia in Morgantown in September, but also the Hoyas’ 0-3 loss to Stanford in August (USC beat the Cardinal 3-0 a month later. In the NCAA tournament, Georgetown edged St. Francis, Rutgers, Virginia and Santa Clara — who beat USC in its season opener three months ago.
Given the Hoyas’ impressive list of wins this fall, McAlpine expects a significant challenge for his side on Friday.
“They are very, very good in the pressure that they bring to you,” he said. “Their attacking players can beat you by themselves, [and] they can beat you in combinations.”
No matter what happens, however, the marathon 2016 season will soon come to an end. So close to the finish line, McAlpine said coaches and players alike were taking time to appreciate the support around them.
“As long as the season is sometimes … We enjoy playing and getting back to the root of it all — and that’s each other,” he said. “[We’re] enjoying the ride we’re on.”
USC-Georgetown is the second of Friday’s semifinal games and will kick off at 4:30 p.m. After No. 1 West Virginia faces No. 6 North Carolina at 2 p.m. Both matches will be televised on ESPNU. Two sides will then play for the National Championship on Sunday, and the Women of Troy will hope to be there, gunning for their second title.

A battle on the boards became domination on the glass for the men’s basketball team on Wednesday night, as it racked up a significant rebounding edge on San Diego en route to a 76-55 road victory at the Jenny Craig Pavilion.
The Trojans picked up their seventh consecutive victory to open the season on Wednesday, and in the process the team outrebounded San Diego by a tally of 44-28.
As USC (7-0) built its 43-31 lead to conclude the first half, the Trojans had a 24-11 edge over the Toreros (2-5) on the glass throughout the opening period of play.
USC sophomore forward Chimezie Metu recorded his second double-double of the season Wednesday night, as he scored a season-high 19 points (on 9-of-11 shooting from the field) and reeled in a career-high 13 rebounds. Metu has scored in double-digits in five of USC’s seven games this season.
Overall, the Trojans shot 30-of-59 (50.8 percent) from the field as they picked up their second consecutive 20-plus point victory.
Metu was one of three double-digit scorers for USC Wednesday night.
Junior guard Elijah Stewart finished the night with 15 points on 6-of-13 shooting from the field.
Freshman forward De’Anthony Melton scored a total of 14 points against the Toreros Wednesday. Melton also grabbed five rebounds, recorded three assists, and picked up two steals on the defensive side.
In total, the Trojans collected seven steals defensively for the game.
Junior guard Jordan McLaughlin recorded a team-high four assists Wednesday and scored 9 points.
Over the final four minutes of regulation, USC shut out a comeback attempt from San Diego by finishing the game on a 9-0 run that included a dunk from Metu.
The Trojans held the Toreros to 18-of-57 (31.6 percent) shooting from the field Wednesday night. In the second half, USC held San Diego to 6-of-25 shooting (24 percent) as it continued to build on its lead.
While USC came away with the victory, a left knee injury to sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright early in the first half concerned the Trojans for the remainder of regulation. After exiting the game only three minutes into regulation due to the injury, Boatwright never returned back into the contest.
Boatwright is coming off of an upper back injury which held him out of several games early on this season.
Head coach Andy Enfield told reporters after the game that Boatwright had an MCL injury, but was hopeful it’s a sprain instead of a tear. Boatwright will have an MRI done on Thursday.
“He’ll certainly be out a while,” Enfield said. “We’re hoping it’s a few weeks versus a season.”
“I’ll be alright, God has my back,” Boatwright tweeted after the game.
USC will now return to Los Angeles to take on BYU (5-2) at the Staples Center as part of the Hoophall LA showcase. The Trojans will look to pick up their eighth consecutive victory and tie the best start for the men’s basketball program since USC began the 2000-2001 season 8-0.

The women’s basketball team entered Wednesday’s game at Texas A&M riding a three-game winning streak and a recent victory in the Great Alaska Shootout. But this was a whole new challenge, on the road facing a top 25 team that has consistently made the NCAA tournament. Against their first major conference opponent of the season, USC delivered, narrowly defeating the Aggies 66-62.
“This win gives us great confidence,” said junior forward Kristen Simon, who led the team with 20 points and 8 rebounds. “Each of the younger players stepped up.”
Matt Karatsu | Daily TrojanIn the clutch · Junior forward Kristen Simon had a game-high 20 points as the women’s basketball team notched an impressive win over Texas A&M. Simon helped seal the 4-point win with late free throws.
Nothing about Wednesday’s game came easy for the Trojans, who shot 4-of-15 from 3-point range and were out-rebounded by 10 rebounds. After a fairly even first quarter, the Aggies took control in the second frame, heading into half-time with a 34-27 lead.
But the Trojans refused to go away. After the break, consecutive 3s by senior guard Courtney Jaco and freshman guard Valerie Higgins reduced Texas A&M’s lead to 40-37, and then Simon was able to take over the game inside of the paint, scoring 16 second-half points.
“I thought Kristen played a great third and fourth quarter,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said. “She led us but got in early foul trouble, so I had to sit her. Then she knocked down huge free throws and shots and took it off the dribble and played with her back to the basket. She did everything we needed her to do in order for us to come away with a victory.”
One very notable aspect of Simon’s game was that she went a perfect 6-6 from the free throw line. Before this season, she shot just 61.5 percent on free throws for her career.
“I’m constantly keeping my focus,” Simon said. “Free throws aren’t expected. Their crowd was loud so it just took a little extra focus to knock them down but I was comfortable and confident.
After USC’s comeback in the third quarter, outscoring the Aggies 22-14, the Trojans held a tenuous 49-48 lead entering the fourth. What ensued was a mercurial final frame that featured four ties and four lead changes.
Early on in the fourth, the Aggies marched out to 57-51 lead. But the Women of Troy quickly tied the game back up two minutes later. After exchanging the lead for most of the period, Simon made two clutch free throws with two minutes left to give her team a 60-59 lead. Texas A&M tied the game one final time as Khaalia Hillsman scored a layup from an inbounds play with just 56 seconds left.
Even at 61-61 with under a minute to go, USC needed to respond in a huge way. They looked to senior guard Sadie Edwards, whose jump shot had been reliable all afternoon.
“I was just trying to be aggressive and the shot was there,” Edwards said. “[Cooper-Dyke] trusted me in that moment.”
With 40 seconds left, Simon handed the ball off to Edwards. When the defense cut off her drive, Edwards stepped back nailing a deep two-point jumper to give USC a 63-61 lead. Free throws by Simon and then Edwards effectively iced the game, and the team secured a difficult win at the electric Reed Arena in College Station.
“What a fantastic women’s basketball game tonight in front of an incredible crowd,” Cooper-Dyke said. “They were active all game long so it was fantastic to play in this atmosphere. I just want to give a shout out to Texas A&M for providing this atmosphere.”
The biggest question entering Wednesday’s game was how the team would respond after losing team captain and fifth-year senior Jordan Adams to a devastating ACL injury last week. Edwards pointed out that it would multiple players to fill the void left by the team’s spiritual and on the court leader in Adams.
“We can play with anybody as long as we play together,” Edwards said.

Man Down is a dramatic thriller with elements of suspense, driven by a performance of Shia LaBeouf in his role of a mentally fragile Marine with post-traumatic stress disorder. The film conveys a message about American veterans oftentimes omitted from mass audiences, but deserving of attention and sympathy nonetheless. America is presented in three different dimensions with abrupt changes of landscapes and narratives throughout the film.
The opening scene shows LaBeouf’s Gabriel armed and determined to save his son, who is a captive in some imaginary inimical camp. This particular sequence is a part of resolution for the film’s main mystery, which is explained hastily in the last 30 minutes. This familiar and proven way to get viewers’ attention from the very beginning serves as a premise to the story, challenging the audience to make their own explanations of the character’s actions before the dilemma is resolved.
The main protagonist, Gabriel, lives with his wife Natalie (Kate Mara) and son Jonathan (Charlie Shotwell) in American suburbs. Through a series of flashbacks it’s clear that he is a loving father and husband, whose blissful domestic paradise is ruined by his Marine duties during the Afghan war.
Photo courtesy of Lionsgate PremiereBrotherhood and betrayal · Actor Shia Laboeuf delivers his most emotionally raw performance to date as a mentally ill military veteran who has a troubled history and relationship with his father.
The story becomes interrupted by hard trainings at Marine boot camp, held by a sadistic sergeant. At the camp, Gabriel strengthens his bond with Devin, a buddy who shares war intricacies with him. They both create a an on-screen picture of brotherly love — which seems to be hard to break — until betrayal takes place.
Aside from suburban family life, an interview in the office of counselor Peyton (Gary Oldman) assessing Gabriel’s mental condition, is another dimension of this story. Gabriel is being interrogated primarily about his personal reflections of military events and domestic drama. The long interview is presented through a series of intercuts with Gabriel revealing his feelings under the pressure of painful memories.
These sequences are tiring for the viewers, though they are the key scenes for getting a sense of the main character’s trauma. Gabriel’s mental dysfunction is played by LaBeouf in a compelling and honest way, which makes this picture less boring. His powerful performance of deep anguish and broken courage attenuates unexplained confusion of mixed intercuts.
Finally, the third dimension shows post-apocalyptic America destroyed by the power of a mysterious enemy. Here Gabriel, with the help of Devin and another survivor (Clifton Collins Jr.), is struggling to find his wife and son, who may be held as captives. This alternate reality is depicted horrifyingly, with ruins and ashes of an American city displayed as a background for Gabriel’s exhausting mission of saving his family.
The images of devastated America are the reality that awaits Gabriel instead of his beloved suburbs. These imagined remains of American city are aimed at delivering the tragedy of those who are unable to survive psychologically after the end of war. At the end, the movie will go back to the opening scene to elaborate on the agony of post-war experience for the whole family. The viewers see Gabriel’s wife and son, terrorized and suffering from painful loss of a husband and father. The final sequences offer depressing revelations and plunges the characters into a turmoil of grief and fear.
Although the movie seems to have no chances for mass appeal without the touching performance of LaBeouf, his impressive ability to play contrasting personalities serves as a successful distraction from the flaws of this melodramatic thriller. The audience gets enough of idyllic suburbs, Afghan streets and delusional ruins, but the lack of carefully exercised transitions between these realities is vivid and almost impossible to outweigh by the core meaning of the movie.
There is a hope that the baffling and seemingly disconnected realms may be compensated by  the outstanding magic of LaBeouf’s acting and the idea to bring catatonic condition of those who went through the war to the attention of the audiences. The score by composer Clint Mansell complements the movie’s indelible sense of woe, transfixing the viewers and getting under viewers’ skin with its moving notes.

After writing my first column of the semester, “More than just a lifestyle: my path to embracing veganism,” I had no idea how my writing would progress. Though I was elated about having a medium to share my passion for veganism, having to write 14 weeks of content daunted me. There were so many aspects of veganism I planned on covering, yet I had no idea how to appertain one to the other.
Each week posed a new challenge. First came the conceptualization of the topic, which was the hardest part. Aside from choosing something I had genuine interest in, I had to strike a balance between a timely, relevant and interesting article that also maintained the caliber of the previous one. More often than not, I would decide on a topic the day before the writing process.
However, once I sat down to write at my desk, the stress subsided. Comparable to an empty dance studio or music practice room, the white blank page became my endearing creative space where my ideas came to life. Once I put on my Beats headphones (no sponsorship intended, but they are exceptional at blocking out background noise) and got into the groove, my focus could not be diverted. Writing while listening to groovy yet complex music — frequently Hiatus Kaiyote — became a source of meditation.
Once the piece was done after around two to three hours of writing, my soul reached a new height. This elation only multiplied when I received feedback. Countless friends and acquaintances reached out to me asking for help in their decision to transition to a plant-based diet, VegNews featured my seventh-week column on its website and an anonymous person wrote me a three-page letter in cursive.
As we approach winter break, holiday cheer looms in the air. The impending month-long relaxation, piqued by Thanksgiving but not achieved until finals are finished, keeps our engines running on near empty tanks. This evocative holiday season encapsulates love — a time to feast on Tofurky roasts and share joy around your Christmas tree or Hanukkah menorah with your friends, family and loved ones.
Love, a tenet of the holiday season, is a selfless and vulnerable entity. Love opens our hearts and allows us to empathize and connect with one another on a deeper level. As Mahatma Gandhi so eloquently said, “Love fears nothing and no one. It cuts through fear at its very root.” So rather than being afraid of ideological differences and those who possess them, love connects us by reminding us that we’re all (extending to all sentient beings) equal, and therefore deserve equal love and compassion. This doctrine applies to the non-vegan readers of my column who engaged with me in meaningful conversations that challenged both of our beliefs.
Love is the supreme emotion that helps us see each other with caring and kindness. Thus, love is the breeding ground for altruism. While I support the practice of effective altruism, donating large sums of money to one charity that you believe will incite the most change, an easy, implementable way to make a difference this holiday season is to try going vegan.
So Trojans, thank you for helping carve my path to embracing love this semester. As a result of your support, I’ve discovered a vital source of happiness. On that note, I hope you all find happiness that will sustain you long after the new year.

Weaving a tight-knit community of black artists is one of the primary goals of the Artist Showcase, a networking opportunity and arts celebration on 7 p.m. Friday at KAOS Network. The Artist Showcase is a part of the Black Student Assembly’s CreEx (short for “creative experience”) initiative and showcases a diverse cast of artists of color who work in different mediums and styles.
“A frustration within the community is that there aren’t a lot of opportunities for them to express themselves freely, without having to compromise themselves or their art,” said Jazmin Hall, co-director of logistics for the BSA’s upcoming showcase. “The CreEx Artist Showcase is an opportunity for BSA’s constituents to ‘be black and showcase our culture.’”
Photo courtesy of USC Black Student AssemblyMaking silenced voices heard · A piece by Tola Oseni graces the wall of the event’s gallery. This gallery is part of the Black Student Assembly’s “creative experience” initiative, the Artist Showcase.
The artists involved were selected through a competitive process spearheaded by Celeste Butler, the event’s A&R specialist. An online open application period preceded two days of live auditions. Butler and Hall’s team worked to include a variety of compelling, original pieces and represent artists in different disciplines. For example, Hall cites senior Omete “M.C.” Anassi, neuroscience and theater double-major, as an especially dynamic performer. He will perform a spoken-word piece at Friday’s showcase, and Hall said that his ambitious, heartfelt and powerful poems often run over seven minutes.
“The people who are producing this show are artists themselves. They understand the needs and the goals and the desires that they have. We want to make sure that the events that we provide are actually beneficial,” Hall said.
While vocal artists and performers occupy the stage, attendees can check out the paintings and visual art that adorn the walls.
“This should be a lot to look at,” Hall said.
The event is hosted at KAOS Network’s Leimert Park venue. KAOS also runs a nearby store that sells African Products. Hall said that her team chose the off-campus location on purpose.
“We wanted to bridge the gap between USC and UCLA,” Hall said. “We wanted to take our students off campus and immerse them in our culture.”
The Artist Showcase is part of a series of CreEx events that will culminate in Gearfest, BSA’s upcoming annual arts festival in February. The CreEx team will unveil the Gearfest promotional video on Friday.
Hall hopes that the Artist Showcase will be of mutual benefit to the artists involved, BSA and the USC community.
“We want to make sure every event is also a networking opportunity. Hopefully, on Friday night they meet someone they can collaborate with,” she said. “Some of our students are working on EPs.”
If the event is successful, it will become an annual tradition. Hall said that she hopes to involve more students from the fine arts next year.
“We all get to meet somewhere in Los Angeles and have a showcase,” Hall said. “It could go on to be something really epic.”
The Artist Showcase is free for USC students and $5 for others. Further information can be found on BSA’s Facebook page.

Fake news has dominated this month’s news cycle. Almost every major media outlet has pointed fingers, profiled someone who writes or publishes fake news, compiled a list of misleading or fake sites and written column after column about what to do to prevent fake news from taking over. To me, this seems to be too little too late. Fake news proclaiming Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had a body double and President Barack Obama was moving to Canada if president-elect Donald Trump won had been shared, circulated and completely absorbed before people made their decisions about who to vote for. It is confusing, then, why major media outlets, along with Facebook and Google, are only trying to seriously grapple with how to ensure a well-informed electorate post-election.
Lily Vaughan | Daily Trojan
While holding Facebook and Google accountable for allowing fake news to be spread is undeniably important, it is equally critical to figure out how to ensure media literacy in our citizens. When I first began hearing about this phenomenon, I thought I knew who was most likely to be duped by these stories.
As an internet native, I’m quite confident in my ability to distinguish between reputable news sources and non-reputable ones, real stories and satire. So, when I began hearing about the false news phenomena, I immediately pointed the finger at those who are older than me. And I’ve seen relatives and family friends who have gone from avid Fox News viewers to sharers of Infowars conspiracy theory videos on Facebook.
However, a recent study from Stanford’s Graduate School of Education evaluated middle school, high school and college students for their abilities to assess the reliability of news sources. The researchers called the results “dismaying.” According to the research, middle schoolers could not distinguish between sponsored ads and news articles, while high school students accepted photos without verifying them. Even most Stanford students failed to identify mainstream versus “fringe” sources. Clearly media literacy is not a problem among a particular age or education demographic.
In order to combat fake news, we must take an expansive approach. The threat to a well-informed citizenry does not come solely from blatantly fake news that Facebook can weed out — though this is a real problem as well. It also comes from biased sources that readers cannot evaluate as biased. Educators at all levels must give students the tools to read curiously, critically and skeptically. They should try to instill in their students a drive to assess the reliability of what they are reading.
An approach to solving the problem of fake news must also take into account that “news” is not the only way misinformation is spread. Just a couple days ago, Twitter user Adam Smoot  posted two Trump tweets side by side, one from 2016 and one from 2011. This format became popular during the election when users would put two tweets from Trump side by side to show that he was being inconsistent, or even lying. Smoot’s tweet, however, was different. One of the tweets was doctored. Smoot doesn’t seem to care that it’s false, nor does he seem to have a political agenda. He later tweeted, “I’m driving people insane with rage.” To him, it’s just funny that people would believe that in 2011, Trump tweeted that burning the American flag is a peaceful protest. In just a day, despite people replying that they could not authenticate the 2011 tweet, Smoot’s deceitful, trolling post got more than 13,000 retweets and 14,000 likes.
Lies spread quickly on social media. Whether it is fallacious stories designed to look credible, clickbait-y and misleading headlines or edited Tweets, the sheer volume and reach of fake news is astounding, and the repercussions are real. Facebook removing blatantly false stories won’t solve the problem. The only thing that will is making it a point to laud fact-checking and truth seeking above viral posts and reductive arguments. There needs to be a cultural shift away from “seeing is believing.”

“If you don’t read the newspaper, you’re uninformed. If you read the newspaper, you’re mis-informed.”
Disgraced ex-NBC ‘fake news’ journalist Brian Williams admitting that he had lied about a story from 2003.  CNN employee Donna Brazile (and Democrat Party operative) resigns after giving Clinton debate questions in advance.  The Podesta emails show slime at every level as the Clinton Campaign chairman coordinates with the press.  Dan Rather formerly of CBS fakes a story on George Bush.  Are getting some hints as to how this is played by our lying press and against which political party the trend runs?  The Obama administration weaponizes the IRS and how much do you hear about it? etc.
Lena,
Empowering the publisher’s political narrative is the journalist’s job. That is why the journalist gets paid. That the the owner’s input into media. 
If you haven’t figured that out, look for a government job.

Another semester has passed at USC, and it would be irresponsible to ignore what the University has achieved — the most recent bout of success being the vote by Undergraduate Student Government to declare our University a sanctuary campus. Victories like these do not occur in a vacuum. Hundreds of signatures followed a petition in favor of the resolution, and numerous students in both USG and other organizations spent weeks fighting for the cause. In other words, monumental change like the kind we recently experienced does not come only with the passage of time — it takes real work, students showing out and pulling through, to achieve real results.
So, with a semester behind us and another ahead, now is the time to plan. Now is the time to explore, to involve oneself, to act. Inaction is to be lost to stagnation; sitting through eight semesters of decent grades and relative contentedness is to have wasted opportunities that offer so much more. Vocational school can give you an education.  Job training programs can give you an education. An online associate’s degree program can give you an education. When paying just under $70,000 to attend a university like USC, you are not only doing it for an education. You are not here to sit idly and absorb information. USC educates you, yes. But a student who receives only that — from a place like this, no less — has been wholly remiss in recognizing what a university is really made of. You are paying to stand in a hallway of open doors. Walk through one.
If you truly believe in something, if you want progress to be made, if you care past a documentary’s sad reminder or a tragic passing thought, it’s time to show out. Change is not the inevitable passage of time. It is a human force.
In an election cycle that knocked the world back on its axis — no matter what side of the aisle you were on — what we found to be the greatest tragedy was not the outcome but the cause. Inaction is such a disappointing ill. After all, the voters who cast ballots for President-elect Donald Trump were only as harmful as those who chose not to cast one at all. There is little to be said for those who stood for nothing, now in a divided United States. We all could have done something; we all could have spoken a little louder; we all could have phone-banked and rallied and debated; we all could have raised concerns last August, when media channels latched on to the Trump phenomenon. Allowing things to occur and pretending they are inevitable is nothing more, really, than inaction.
We demand much from this campus, it’s true. But we can only demand that for which we are willing to work. Social justice and equality, partnership with the local community, tuition freezes, transparency, environmental sustainability — all these have been fought for, and some achieved; but there were always those who were unwilling to act, those who were in agreement but were unwilling to get off the couch, those who wouldn’t show out. “I’m busy” is easy to say, but only you can decide if that’s really true. If it isn’t, either make the time to do the work, or quit overestimating the amount that you like to believe you care.
If you loved Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders but you’ve never shown up to support the USC College Democrats, recognize that real progressivism is about grassroots efforts. If you supported Donald Trump and believe that conservatism is attacked on this campus, make time to go to a meeting of the USC College Republicans. Climate change has worsened because, for the most part, we have been unwilling to act. Join the USC Environmental Student Assembly. Work toward improving global health and disease prevention with USC GlobeMed. Create something, fight for something, do something — if an organization which you believe in is hosting a fundraiser, consider contributing in a manner as simple as buying a cookie.
The worst thing to say at the end of your time at USC — or even larger, your life — is that you had the right words for dinner conversation but when it came down to getting out the door, you barely cared. The causes, creations and dreams that you believe in need your help. There is no change without human force. There is no improvement without effort. Your time at USC is not just about receiving an education. It is about moving through open doors, making a difference, acting on behalf of something, becoming involved in something. Whether that means making critical media on TrojanVision or improving a child’s day at Kicks for Kids is up to you. At the end of your four years, be able to say you took advantage not only of an education, but of a university. Make time meaningful as it passes — because it will, and fast.
Some say those who stand for nothing will fall for anything, but that’s not the case. Quite frankly, those who stand for nothing do so because they can’t find the grit to get up.
The first sentence of this piece should give you a clue as to this young author’s wayward thinking.  There is simply nothing good or “progressive” about ignoring the law or protecting those who do.  As I’ve stated countless times, the United States has some of the most generous immigration laws of any nation.  We swear in thousands upon thousands of new citizens every year, who have followed the legal requirements for coming here legally.  Among those here are students from countries around the world who apply for visas to attend our many quality universities.  For institutions like USC to protect those among us who have not followed the generous rule of law is preposterous and shameful …and certainly not progressive.  For one thing, it flies in the face of the many who are here legally, particularly on a college campus where international students attend on visas.  So-called sanctuary campuses or cities fly in the face of the many who sacrificed to attend USC or other schools legally.  As I’ve also mentioned before, a sanctuary city or campus sets up two classes of people:  Those who follow the law, and those who don’t, for whom the law is broadly ignored or waived.  How outrageous is that?!  And let’s be clear, many of those here legally are of poor or modest means, and have overcome tremendous sacrifice to be here …so the argument taht some people simply can’t afford to come here legally is total nonsense.  It’s also literally beside the point because immigration is not a civil right, nor a human right or entitlement.  It’s a privilege that must be applied for and approved.  There is nothing progressive or noble about unlawfully declaring a sanctuary campus.  So again, the first sentence of this article should inform and alert the reader as to the flawed logic to come.
As to the main point of the article:  Yes, it is true that action and activism are effective in bringing about change.  It’s also often true that the degree to which someone cares about a particular cause will be demonstrated by how actively involved they choose to be.  But even here there is room for nuance.  For example:  Just because someone believes in a certain cause doesn’t mean they agree with a certain method for promoting or supporting it.  One might agree with a certain cause, but disagree that marches or protests are the way to promote their position.  Keep in mind another of my observations:  Liberals, in general, are more vocal about their positions, whereas Conservatives (perhaps by definition) tend to be more reserved and quiet, holding their positions close to their sleeves.  This is likely one reason that everyone misjudged the election results this year.  Literally millions of conservatives were unhappy with the Leftist policies and direction of our nation …but rather than join marches, protests, riots or phone banks, they quietly showed up at the polls on November 8th.  So in other words, true devotion to a cause is not always measured by how openly or “actively” one supports it.
In short, activism does indeed produce results, and there is virtue in fighting for causes one believes in.  But I would leave readers with two thoughts to ponder:  1. Democrats didn’t lose this election because their message wasn’t heard broadly or clearly enough; They lost because their message was soundly rejected.  2.  College is a great time for learning and discovery, and this includes challenging your own ideas.  Too often the only message heard on university campuses is the “sounds good” coddling positions of the Left.  I would suggest young people in college open their minds and ears to other messages.  At least listen and consider.  Learn the virtue in being told “no” or “not now”.  Learn what real sacrifice is.  Ask yourselves if you are really “principled”, or do you just have a philosophy of “whatever works for you” or “to each his own”.
