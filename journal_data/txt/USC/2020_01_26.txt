Since the California State Legislature took the reins of the college amateurism debate last September, enacting a bill that would allow California student-athletes to profit from their name, image and likeness starting in 2023, political intervention has emerged as a key tool to pressure NCAA reform.
2020 will likely prove to be a pivotal year for the future of the NCAA, with over two dozen state legislatures currently deliberating similar laws. Some of the proposals being debated, including a bill under consideration in New York that would allocate a share of ticket revenue as payment for student-athletes, would go even further than the law California passed.
Providing just compensation to student-athletes — who, aside from their scholarships and a few nominal stipends, are locked out of the revenue created by the $13 billion college athletics industry — constitutes important rationale for laws challenging the NCAA’s amateurism system. However, it’s clear that the competitive atmosphere of college sports is also playing a role in the ongoing political intervention into NCAA amateurism.
Last year, the California law presented the NCAA with two unappealing options: punish the California NCAA schools for non-compliance with its amateurism rules when the law goes into effect in 2023 or risk giving the California schools a competitive advantage by allowing their student-athletes to profit from name, image and likeness while student-athletes at schools in other states cannot. In the end, the NCAA caved, promising to reconsider its amateurism rules altogether to comply with the California law. Now, other states are considering laws that would, in turn, give their own in-state NCAA programs a competitive advantage and possibly pressure the NCAA into further reform.
The NCAA’s submission to the will of the California State Legislature seems likely to usher in a period of upheaval for the NCAA’s amateurism model, which should be welcomed by college sports fans. After years of rejecting pleas to fairly compensate student-athletes, the NCAA clearly will not reform on its own accord. While some proposed state laws relating to student-athletes’ rights to compensation are not ideal, coercive action by state lawmakers is a necessary means of dismantling the unsustainable status quo in college sports.
Also, from a competitive standpoint, USC Athletics is poised to benefit from further changes to the NCAA’s amateurism model. California’s passage of the name, image and likeness law demonstrates its status as a state at the forefront of new, innovative legal thinking and hints that it will continue to mount the most aggressive challenges to amateurism, regardless of whether they comply with NCAA rules. This will benefit USC and other California universities, allowing them to offer student-athletes the most generous compensation.
Obviously, the California state legislature’s willingness to tackle the issue of NCAA amateurism would not benefit USC in relation to rivals UCLA, Cal and Stanford, which are also located in California. But an advantage over programs in other states would give USC (along with the other California schools) a competitive boost at a time when they are struggling to maintain national relevance in football and men’s basketball, the two sports that would be affected most by updated amateurism rules due to their huge revenue-producing capacity.

The USC men’s basketball team split a pair of games on its Oregon road trip, losing to No. 12 Oregon Thursday and easily handling Oregon State Saturday. 
After beating the Stanford Cardinal in one of the most improbable comebacks in college basketball this season, the Trojans entered their game against the Ducks in sole possession of first place. USC’s time at the top was short-lived, however, as it fell in a double-overtime thriller, 79-70.
Trailing for most of the game, USC caught fire and came back to tie things up at the end of regulation. The first overtime period did not have much action as both teams scored just 5 points each. In the second overtime, however, USC appeared fatigued and Oregon stepped on the gas to pull away.
The dual-threat of guards junior Chris Duarte and senior Payton Pritchard combined for 54 total points to lead the charge for Ducks. USC freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu scored 23 points and pulled down 14 rebounds to keep the Trojans in the game.
“You’ve got to take care of the ball,” USC head coach Andy Enfield said, per USC Athletics. “Some ill-timed passes that went to the other guys. We just have to make the right basketball play. Give them credit, they’re a good defensive team.”
USC’s record fell to 15-4 while Oregon advanced to 16-4, and the Ducks moved into second place in the Pac-12 behind Stanford. 
However, the Trojans caught up to Oregon again in the conference standings after beating the Beavers in a 75-55 rout in Corvallis.
USC clearly put its loss to Oregon in the past as it went on to lead Oregon State 30-8 at one point in the first half. The Beavers climbed their way back into the game before halftime but would not force a lead change at any point as USC ran away with the lead late. 
Okongwu continued to lead the Trojans’ efforts in their win, scoring a team-high 18 points and recording eight rebounds in only 25 minutes of play.
“Some of [Okongwu’s] dunks tonight were just spectacular,” Enfield said per the Los Angeles Times. “The first one was good down the lane, and the one about a minute or two later was just ridiculously impressive. He’s a special young man, very explosive, especially with a running start.”
Senior guard Jonah Mathews did not disappoint either, scoring 16 points and playing tenacious defense in 37 minutes. 
USC had an offensive field day against the Beavers, shooting nearly 65% from the field while missing only six shots in the entire second half. As for Oregon State, it was a different story: the Beavers shot only 37% for the entire game, and the Trojans’ defense held them to only 28 points in the paint.
Oregon State senior forward Tres Tinkle led the team in points and rebounds with 17 and five respectively, but it was not enough to match USC’s offense. However, he set the Oregon State record at 35 straight made free throws, only to miss his very next one. 
The Trojans now find themselves in second place in the Pac-12 with a 5-2 conference record, tied with Colorado. USC will take on Utah at 6:30 p.m. Thursday at Galen Center before beginning a tough stretch against Colorado, Arizona and Arizona State.

Former NBA superstar Kobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna were killed Sunday morning after a helicopter crashed in Calabasas just before 10 a.m. Bryant and Gianna were on their way to Thousand Oaks for her basketball practice. He was 41.
Bryant grew up as a fan of the Los Angeles Lakers and played with them for all of his 20-year career. Considered by many as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, Bryant was an 18-time All-Star and the 2008 league MVP, leading the Lakers to five NBA championships. 
Bryant had three straight championship-winning seasons with teammate Shaquille O’Neal and head coach Phil Jackson from 2000-02 before O’Neal was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004. That trade, however, cemented Bryant’s role as the Lakers’ franchise leader. He would go on to win two more championships with Jackson and teammate Pau Gasol in 2009 and 2010 before tearing an Achilles tendon in 2013 at age 34.
Bryant was always one of the most respected players in the league during his career and a staple of Los Angeles inside and outside of sports. The news of his passing impacted USC students — Lakers fans or not — who grew up watching and idolizing the “Black Mamba.” 
“It’s more than just basketball really with Kobe, he kind of just encompassed everything L.A.,” said Diego Briones, a junior majoring in political science. “Especially because it’s such an artsy town, he was such a sophisticated, intellectual person … He really viewed the sport like an art and I think that really resonates with a lot of Los Angeles citizens.”
Bryant was also a two-time Olympic gold medalist in Beijing and London and served as a key figure in helping expand the NBA’s international reach, attracting and inspiring young fans from all across the world.
Bryant moved to Italy when he was 6 as his father had retired from the NBA to play internationally. Overseas, Bryant not only learned how to speak fluent Italian and play soccer but he started to seriously learn how to play basketball.
“He’s an international icon,” Briones said. “He helped take basketball international … I think he’s pivotal in that regard.”
Bryant’s tenacious work ethic, highlighted in his book “The Mamba Mentality: How I Play,” has served as a model for young athletes and others inside and outside the realm of sports. He was known for his unwavering, constant willingness to improve.
“Kobe’s legacy isn’t even basketball, it’s work ethic and dedication,” said Jayden Smith, a sophomore majoring in political science. “The way Kobe trained, he did that in every aspect of his life. Everything he does he obsesses over it, over the minute details, and does everything he can to be better than the person that he’s competing against.”
For many, that drive and determination extends past basketball.
“Kobe has been my role model my whole life, sort of my idol,” said Tyler Ghajar, a freshman majoring in art. “I got inspiration from his work ethic and determination … to sort of apply that to my life. He was more than an athlete in terms of what he meant for this city and just for people in general.”
Bryant’s legacy is a somewhat complicated one. In 2003, Bryant was arrested and charged for allegedly sexually assaulting a hotel employee in Colorado. The accuser later dropped the charges after refusing to testify but later filed a separate civil suit against Bryant. Bryant did not directly admit guilt but publicly apologized for the circumstances between himself and the employee.
Bryant’s death comes just one day after he was passed by current Lakers superstar LeBron James for third all-time on the NBA’s career scoring leaderboard. James was seen in tears after the Lakers landed in Los Angeles after flying in from Philadelphia, Bryant’s hometown.
After the news of Bryant’s death was first reported by TMZ Sports and followed by confirmation by multiple outlets, numerous celebrities, sports figures and fans were quick to share their grief on social media. Memorials were quickly set up near the crash site and outside Staples Center, the Lakers’ home arena and site of the 2020 Grammy Awards show that began just hours later, bringing a mix of attendees and mourners to L.A. Live.
“I hope people — regardless of their affiliation to teams, whether they’re a Laker fan or whether they’re a Celtic fan, whether they’re even a basketball fan or even a sports fan — just recognize what he meant to the city,” Smith said. “He was able to get a whole city to get behind him and embrace him … Kobe is L.A. basketball.”
Bryant — especially after his retirement — was also an outspoken advocate for growing women’s basketball, frequently attending college and WNBA games, coaching Gianna’s teams and using social media to praise women’s basketball players.
Bryant has become a household name for many across the globe, including those outside of the basketball community and fanbase. His legacy and approach towards his goals even impacted people off the court that did not tune in to witness his impressive on-court performances.
“Kobe Bryant really was a huge influence even on those of us who never really were big on basketball,” freshman Economics major Freya Haksar said. “He was the kind of icon that gave you a vision of success…He was always kind of a figure for us to keep pushing forward, to turn our challenges and pressures into lessons, and a drive to always keep our heads up and better ourselves and spread that energy to the people around us.”
Almost four years after the final game of Bryant’s career — a 60-point performance against the Utah Jazz at Staples Center in April 2016 — his impact is still felt in the NBA. Now, after Bryant’s passing, his legacy in the sport and in the lives of fans around the world is sure to live on. 
“I think his passing is definitely a part of the city is passing, too,” Ghajar said. “And any sport you can apply his mindset, the Mamba Mentality to it. You can apply the Mamba Mentality to anything in life, really. [He] will be missed everywhere.”
Bryant and Gianna are survived by Kobe’s wife Vanessa and three daughters — Natalia Diamante (17), Bianka Bella (3) and Capri Kobe (7 months).

The Viterbi School of Engineering’s online graduate information technology program combines accessibility with convenience. Known as Distance Education Network, or DEN@Viterbi, the program has been ranked the No. 1 computer information technology online master’s program in the nation by the U.S. News & World Report for seven consecutive years. 
The program provides engineering professionals with opportunities to advance their education remotely, DEN Associate Dean Binh Tran said.
DEN enables online students to access live classes or watch video recordings later. With online discussions and office hours, DEN courses offer engagement and allow online students to be actively involved in classes, Tran said.
“[DEN students] would actually join any of our classes via telephone or video conferencing,” Tran said. “If they had questions, or they have to do the presentations, they do it online, and they’re just part of the traditional class.” 
DEN holds events for online students to come and network with each other to give them a chance to experience life on campus more often, Tran said.
“We will host homecoming and [tailgates] where we only invite online students to come and meet with other online students,” Tran said. “We have graduation commencement ceremonies and receptions just for online students.” 
DEN students are admitted by the same standards as on-campus students. According to the report, 96% of DEN students provide their GRE scores on their applications, a figure much higher than similar programs at other schools, such as those at Johns Hopkins and New York universities.
“This is the same exact degree of students coming in on campus,” Tran said. “[DEN students] have the same admissions requirements, they do the exact same work and assessments as on-campus students do.” 
John Pascarella, an associate professor of clinical education, said online education provides more diverse ways for students to interact with instructors while not being confined to time and location in an increasingly digital world.
“What online education does is it opens up back channels of communication through chatting, messaging and offering questions that perhaps [students] would be too intimidated to ask,” Pascarella said. 
In the studio classroom, instructors use two computers to show the lecture slides and their own solutions simultaneously, according to Victor Adamchik, a professor of computer science practice.
“In each DEN room, there are three screens, with left and right screens to show the textbook, and I’m using the central screen to show my solutions to the problems,” Adamchik said.
Associate professor of computer science practice Wensheng Wu, who teaches a graduate computer science course with a DEN session this semester, said he uses emails, discussion boards and live streaming classes to engage online students.
“We do have a phone line they can call and ask questions,” Wu said. “I’ll be talking to DEN students to make sure that they are getting familiar with arrangement [and] make sure that they don’t miss the test.”
Tran said a significant portion of DEN students are working professionals who want to advance or change their careers by taking online programs.
“Most of them come in [with] the average age older than our on-campus students,” Tran said. “They are different in terms of having a lot of other things that are happening in their lives that are different from a traditional, full-time, on-campus student.” 
DEN student Brandon Stephan, who is pursuing a master’s degree in data science, said that DEN’s flexibility allows him take online courses similar to those on campus without having to move out of his hometown.
“The field of data science is continuously changing, and you need to be learning every day,” Stephan said. “I believe that obtaining another graduate degree in data science will help me on that path of continual learning … and help me advance my career and have higher pay.”
DEN also benefits on-campus students who may have other academic or career plans that conflict with traditional classes, Tran said.
“Many of our on-campus students sometimes will take internships or take jobs,” Tran said. “They’re able to make the transition into online students without having to sacrifice the academic program.” 
Tran said the greatest challenge in building the DEN program was communicating all the resources and services available to online students while maintaining standards comparable to those of other University programs.  
“We tell them and we remind them that you are in a very rigorous academic program — you’re not getting a different degree,” Tran said. “A lot of it is just making sure that they understand the requirements.” 
Pascarella also mentioned that a limitation of online education that both instructors and students needed to be aware of was the feelings of detachment that may result from the programs’ remoteness.  
“One of the biggest challenges with online education is the dissonance, not the distance, that can occur in the experience,” Pascarella said. “We need students to speak up, reach out, advocate for their learning.”

The USC Department of Health sent out a memo Sunday informing students about recent developments regarding the coronavirus outbreaks. Despite the two cases confirmed in Los Angeles and Orange counties Sunday, there is no indication that the virus will affect the USC community, according to Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman. 
More than 2,000 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with 56 deaths occurring in and near Wuhan, China. Five U.S. cases have been confirmed, including the two incidents in California as well as three in Seattle, Chicago and Arizona. The Arizona case involves a student at Arizona State University who did not live in university housing.
Van Orman said the University has been working closely with the Los Angeles Public Health Department to monitor developments closely. According to Sunday’s memo, there has been no evidence of person-to-person transmission in the California cases.
There is no quarantine in place for those returning from affected areas in China. Individuals can continue normal activities but are asked to monitor for flu-like symptoms. If experiencing symptoms, individuals are urged to seek immediate medical care. 
Although officials are not worried that the virus will spread, the University is ready to work with the L.A. County of Public Health should a community member contract the virus. 
“If it were a student that [was] affected we would … [make] sure that [they have] appropriate medical care,” Van Orman said. “[We would use] contact tracing, where we identify who might have had contact with that individual during the potentially infectious period and those people are put under monitoring … They wouldn’t be restricted or quarantined.” 
Van Orman also urged students to keep in mind that the situation in China is more serious than in the United States and to be aware of how the situation may affect students, staff and faculty members who may have family in the affected areas. 
“We know that there are many members of the Trojan [Family] from that area,” Van Orman said. “[We want] to remind everybody to offer support to people and that there are a lot of students who are very worried about their loved ones.”
According to the provost’s letter, influenza shots cannot be administered to treat the coronavirus. However, Van Orman said the odds of a member of the USC community acquiring the virus are low and urges students to instead shift concerns to the flu. 
“If I were to tell people to be worried about any communicable disease right now, it would be influenza,” Van Orman said. “The things that we’re recommending for influenza are also things that would protect against any other virus.”

Before creating the Master of Business for Veterans Foundation, Benjamin Manibog noted the USC MBV program lacked the alumni network and volunteer engagement opportunities that other degree programs’ alumni associations offer. At a football tailgate, he heard MBV alumni reminisce about the cohort community of the program and wanted to re-create the feeling of fellowship.
“We noticed that cohorts were expressing how much they missed being on campus and how there wasn’t any alumni association specifically for MBV students that graduated,” said Manibog, who serves as president of the foundation. “[Much like the] camaraderie in the military, they felt like they really had that while they were in MBV … When they left after they graduated, they felt that huge disconnect.”
Founded in December, the organization offers a youth mentorship program, veteran scholarship grants and encouragement for veterans considering graduate degrees in business.
“We want to make a significant impact in the world,” Manibog said. “What I wanted to do is continue to have a platform for these veteran students to continue to make a difference in people’s lives in their communities.”
Marshall School of Business adjunct professor Kathy Takayama, whose father served in the Navy during the Vietnam War, said she was recruited to the MBV Foundation after the foundation learned of her fundraising experience and volunteer work. Following the unexpected loss of her husband, Takayama started raising money for scholarships for high school graduates.
“One of the things that a military person misses when they leave the military and go to the civilian world is the camaraderie,” Takayama said. “Through this MBV program, you kind of get to hang around veterans, and similarly, everyone else wants to kind of connect and help each [other].” 
In October, Manibog, along with other MBV alumni, had a “customer discovery phase” in which they asked alumni and current students about their biggest concerns during the course of the program. They found that many people in the MBV community faced issues paying for the program after exhausting their GI Bill and Veterans Affairs benefits.  
In response to the discovery poll, the MBV Foundation plans to fund scholarships to encourage veterans to continue their education. 
Amy Curran, an active-duty Marine in the MBV program, learned about the foundation in a class talk by Manibog and immediately knew she wanted to be a part of the program. 
“I want to be able to show the next generation, ‘This is what it means to have a family. This is what taking care of each other is about, and you can succeed regardless of where you came from,’” Curran said.
The foundation works with organizations like Habitat for Humanity in Los Angeles in addition to developing mentorship partnerships with at-risk youth. For Manibog, the program hits close to home after a troubled childhood, providing character development that he would have benefited from. By mentoring, he wants to expand the opportunities he has received to other young people in difficult situations. 
“I went to a continuation school. Never in a million years would think I would end up at USC,” Manibog said. “Everyone that goes through this program, all we can think about is … how can we continue to give because we’re so grateful for all [of the] things that we’ve gotten.” 
Manibog said the foundation hopes to tap into the MBV alumni network to encourage more veterans to continue their education at USC. 
“We want to use the strength of our alumni and tap into their resources, their connections, the companies that they’re working with,” he said. 
Manibog said he wants the foundation to serve as a community that inspires its members to surmount challenges like the ones he faced during his childhood and later, when he had problems with drug use. 
“My ‘why’ [in life] is to illuminate the hearts of others, so that they may rise above their barriers and summit the highest peaks,” Manibog said. “I just want to inspire people to see them achieve their goals, to overcome their obstacles, and I feel like the MBV Foundation is the way to do that.”

A poet, singer-songwriter, producer and painter, Ryan Evins’ first experience with the art world came early. 
Evins was in elementary school when she began writing poetry about her life experiences. 
“The workshops in poetry made my writing so much stronger,” Evins said. “In my songs, my lyrics are not necessarily very complex but I definitely feel like they are very meaningful and get [straight to] the point.”
Evins’ writings later tied into her passion for music, serving as the foundation for her songwriting career. She said, music is the best platform to communicate her thoughts and have her writings resonate with others.
Evins said she initially found it difficult to create music due to a lack of financial resources and professional experience. She then realized that she needed to refocus her energy into her art. 
 “I’ve always been into music,” Evins said. “I always sang, but I’ve never actually put any of my work out until this year … I had a hard time finding opportunities to do that because I came to [Los Angeles] expecting things to be a lot easier than they were. But when you don’t have music out there, it’s a lot harder to get people to work with you.” 
Evins didn’t want the lack of money to be an obstacle, so she decided to learn how to use music production tool GarageBand to make her own songs. 
Evins describes her genre as R&B and hip-hop. As a writer, she said she has been influenced by spoken word and tries to integrate that style into her songs. Since USC does not offer a spoken word major, Evins chose to pursue creative writing so that she could find unique ways to resonate with her audience. 
Evins said Robin Coste Lewis, a USC writer-in-residence, helped her reach a deeper understanding of her writing.
“[She] taught us that it’s not all about how much you write, it’s really about saying as much as you can while saying the least [amount of words],” Evins said.
To create a song that speaks to her, Evins said she creates her lyrics first, then she creates a melody to fit the story.
“When I’m making music, I feel like both [the lyrics and the music] have to be on point for me to want to fully engage with it,” Evins said. “My process for making the song [is] that I always start with the words first, and then I’ll build my beat around whatever I have. The important thing is the message.” 
Evins said she hopes her music inspires others to have an optimistic outlook on life, even if they are facing hardships. 
“My intention is to let people know that even though we all go through bad days, it’s inevitable,” Evins said. “We’re all going to be there, we’re all going to go through it [but] that there’s always an upside to it. The bad times never last forever.”
 Evins is using her latest project “Chrysalis,” which was released as an EP this month on Spotify, iTunes and Amazon Music, as a way to give listeners a taste of her music and also to gauge her audience. It consists of four tracks: “Away From You,” “Found,” “Butterfly” and spoken-word track “Genes.” 
Evins describes the EP as a mixture of poetry, hip-hop and contemporary R&B. She said the main message the project conveys is that life is about transformation — maintaining growth even amid downturns. 
 Syann Cromwell, who was Evins’ roommate from freshman to junior year, said Evins’ music is raw, honest and relatable and that she appreciates the fact that her songs are based on her own experiences.  
“It’s a very open and free form of expression,” Cromwell said. “A lot of personal topics, and relatable things, as well, come through in her music.”
 Cromwell said she believes Evins’ music is unique and purposeful, rather than commercialized ear candy.
“Ryan kind of reminds me of Kehlani and Jhene Aiko,” Cromwell said. “Like soft but powerful women who are actually saying things in their music and you can also tell it comes from a place of sincerity and honesty and lived experience.”
 Jackie Childs, a 2019 USC graduate, met Evins during one of her performances at Ground Zero.
Evins has performed at Ground Zero several times through the venue’s monthly First Friday series and looks to continue sharing her music with the USC community.
Childs said he believes that Evins’ integration of poetry and spoken word into her music makes her stand out in the music scene. 
“I really enjoy [her music],” Childs said. “It’s raw, and her being a writer makes it even better in the fact that she produces her own tracks.”
Childs describes Evins as a warrior because she is willing to be frank and open about the dark moments in her life and serve as an example to others as to how to stay positive.
“She’s very courageous,” Childs said. “She goes through a lot. It takes courage to spit your soul through the wire like that. It takes courage to overcome stuff [and] still want to motivate people and uplift other people even when your situation isn’t the best.” 
Evins will perform songs from her EP at Ground Zero Feb. 7.

They came from Canada, inside a big cardboard box sporting a lime green Priority Mail Express sticker. The whole thing was mummified with layers of clear packing tape. I had kept a vigilant eye on the tracking number for days, my anxiety multiplying with every delay as the package was held up in customs. It was not until the box was safely inside my apartment, with me hovering over it with a pocket knife, that I finally allowed the tension to leave my body. 
Inside the package was a pair of Tabi shoes. If you’re into fashion, you’ll immediately go “Ahhh,” as the above paragraph now makes total sense to you. If you’re not into fashion, you’re probably going “Uh … what?” Allow me to introduce you to one of the most iconic — and controversial — shoes in fashion history. 
Martin Margiela, who co-founded the luxury fashion house Maison Margiela, introduced Tabi shoes at his debut show in 1989. They were not an original idea — split-toe shoes, known as jika-tabi, had been worn by Japanese workers as far back as the 15th century. But these Tabi shoes weren’t the flip-flop-esque thonged sandals that the Japanese favored; these were white high-heeled boots with a prominent cleft in the middle. Additionally, Margiela swathed the runway in white fabric and coated the bottoms of the Tabi shoes in red paint, so that as the models walked, they left a trail of distinctive goat-like hoofprints. 
The demand for the boots was swift and instantaneous, and never died down. Since the first iteration, Margiela has released Tabi shoes in every design and color you could possibly imagine. There are Tabi boots in metallic pink and sequined silver. There are Tabi ballet flats and Tabi sneakers. In 2019, to celebrate its 30th anniversary, Margiela came out with special edition Tabi keychains, T-shirts and purses. Tabi shoes are to Margiela the way Birkins are to Hermès or red-bottoms are to Louboutin. 
Tabi shoes aren’t as polarizing as cilantro, but they come pretty close. It’s impossible to feel ambivalent about them: You either love them or you hate them, and you know which camp you’re in the moment you lay eyes on them. Those who love them wax poetic about its versatility, originality and eroticism (something about that split). They’re a fixture on the feet of first-year Parsons School of Design and Fashion Institute of Technology students. Those who hate them report feeling repulsed and nauseated by the design and can’t possibly fathom why anyone would want to make their feet look like a satyr’s. 
As for myself, I’m (obviously) Team Tabi. I see clothes and things I want every day, but nothing inhabited my desires quite like Tabi shoes. I haunted luxury e-commerce sites like SSENSE and Totokaelo, checking nearly every day for price drops and inventory count. But I couldn’t bring myself to take the plunge. Why? Because they’re just under $1,000. 
I realize that my writing about buying Tabi shoes may be viewed as an obvious flex. After all, the ability to drop that much money on a single pair of boots necessitates an enormous amount of privilege. I’m very fortunate in that my parents pay my tuition and rent, thus freeing up the money I make myself to be solely discretionary. 
For two years, I coveted these shoes. Every month, I’d set aside a portion of my paycheck, in the hopes of one day securing a pair of the OG white boots. 
On Black Friday, SSENSE held a blowout sale that knocked a few hundred dollars off the price. Short of buying them secondhand, which I’d scrounged to no avail, this was the cheapest these boots would ever get. I bought them. They arrived in early December, and the moment I sliced through the tape, unfurled the tissue paper and slipped them on my feet was a high I hadn’t experienced and will never again experience. 
I have never worn them outside. 
It’s not that the boots aren’t everything I’d dreamt of — they are. I think that’s the problem. The leather is smooth and supple, the stitching delicate yet sturdy, the craftsmanship exquisite. It’s just … the thought of such perfection being marred by the dirt and grime of L.A.’s streets — it breaks my heart. 
Here’s the thing. White shoes are either for the deeply diligent, who are assiduous enough to coat them in protectant and scour away stains, or the incredibly laid-back, who don’t give a shit if their shoes look like they’ve been through hell. Sadly, I am caught in the middle — too lazy to do the work necessary to keep them pristine but still irrationally upset when a scuff mark appears. I just know that an errant smudge is inevitable, and I also know that in such an event my nervous collapse is also inevitable. Do I really want to inflict that emotional turmoil on myself? 
After two straight years of ardent longing, I guess it should come as no surprise that I’m too precious about my Tabi shoes to ever subject them to their intended purpose. So for now, I keep them painstakingly wrapped up in their original shoebox, high up on a shelf in my closet. 
Maybe one day I’ll muster up the courage to wear them. Maybe.

Lauryn Henry did not think she could sing until her fifth-grade talent show. That night, Henry sang “Energy” by Keri Hilson while wearing fingerless gloves, Ed Hardy high-top shoes and a big chunky star necklace from Limited Too — and from there on, no one ever stopped her. 
For Henry, a senior majoring in cinema and media studies, RYL0 is a revival of her passion for music, specifically electronic music. She has been interested in the genre since middle school and in ninth grade, made a decision to one day become an “international superstar-DJ.”
“I told my mom, ‘I want to do this. I want to be a music producer. I want to be Dillon Francis. I want to be Diplo. I want to be Steve Aoki.’ She was like, ‘OK. OK,’” Henry said. “My mom is a very smart woman, a very strategic woman and wants the same exact thing for me. Her policy is … ‘If you’re going to do it, you have to do it so well that there’s no choice but for you to be successful.’” 
From there, Henry’s mother enrolled her in DJ classes at Scratch DJ Academy in New York City. However, Henry’s experience at the Academy discouraged her from continuing music. 
“Ultimately, [the classes] probably did more harm than good,” Henry said. “Ageism definitely exists in the world … especially in music because I went to these classes being taught by white men in their mid-30s, earlier 40s. … I felt out of place as a young, black woman just not knowing exactly what I wanted to do … It was a great moment of exposure, but it also scared the hell out of me.”
Even though Henry finished the course, she said she experienced imposter syndrome, which led her to doubt whether or not she wanted to pursue music. 
That was until summer 2017 when Lorde released her sophomore album “Melodrama.” Inspired by Lorde’s lyricism, Henry experienced a newfound renaissance for her love of music and dove into songwriting. 
Her first original release as RYL0 was a song called “E-boy!!,” which was created in less than 24 hours after a friend dared Henry to create it. Her song after that, “Twilight (Remix),” features hypnotizing beats that never bore the listener: It incorporates Edward Cullen’s (Robert Pattinson) iconic line “Hold on tight, spider monkey” from the “Twilight” movies as well as pieces from the instrumental tune of “Bella’s Lullaby.”
As absurd as it may sound, it totally works. The song is a mesmerizing journey from beginning to end, showing just how ingenious RYL0 can be. 
Henry released her EP titled “The Death of a Loved One” in November and hosted a release party for the EP at Junior High Los Angeles —  a space that showcases the artwork of women of color and queer voices for free. 
Creative director and visual artist Janae Marable assisted Henry with the release party and various artwork for “The Death of a Loved One.” 
“[Working with RYL0] is an absolute joy,” Marable said. “It has been cool to see her develop in such a short amount of time … She’s easy to work with, she’s inventive, beyond creative, is excited about anything she can create and get her hands on.”
Reanna Cruz, a junior majoring in cinematic arts, film and TV Production, has also seen Henry’s progress since the very inception of RYL0. 
“The space that she’s is in right now, being a queer woman of color in these EDM spaces, that kind of persona and that kind of artistry at USC is something that you can’t really find right now,” Cruz said. “And that whole idea of daring to go into unchartered territory is something that I’ve always admired about [Henry], and especially about RYL0.”
Henry’s one-of-a-kind sound is a product of her production style, in which she produces every single song by herself. 
“I wouldn’t be RYL0 without the experience of producing these songs myself,” Henry said. “RYL0 wouldn’t be RYL0 if someone else were producing these songs.”
When making songs, she tends to focus on the instrumentals first and her voice second. 
“I might come up with a melody, or I might come up with a phrase … and then I go into my software system and come up and build up a whole song around it,” Henry said. “And then after the whole instrumental is done, I’ll go back to the initial phrase or melody that inspired it and build the lyrics and the rest of the vocals around it.”
Moving forward, Henry’s next project as RYL0 will explore the gray areas of life, delving into a diary entry of what is currently occupying her mind, such as her concerns for the world and the livelihood of humanity. 
“What does it mean to be young growing up in a dying world?” Henry said. “What does it mean to be Black and a woman growing up in a world where representation matters, yet I feel as unrepresented as ever? What is all of this about?”
The project will feature a song that centers around the idea of how it feels to be a woman of color not experiencing the love one thinks one deserves.

The big game is coming up. Barely a week and both teams will take the stage as millions of fans rabidly watch and wait, hoping for an assured victory. I’m of course referring to the Feb. 3 Iowa Caucuses on Monday. Mark your calendars accordingly. Perhaps, you thought I meant the Super Bowl, which takes place a mere day earlier.
Reader, I can’t fault your confusion. After all, these two events have more in common than just their proximity on my February calendar. Millions of Americans will watch these two events unfold in real time on TV and through Facebook and Twitter feeds. I can’t say the stakes are the same, but anticipation clouds both events, nevertheless.
Over the next week, ESPN commentators will form anxious roundtables as they discuss each team’s Super Bowl prospects. Much the same, political pundits will crowd around their own tables to pontificate on this season’s crop of Democratic and Republican hopefuls.
For a state known for corn and, well, more corn, Iowa’s take on the primary election — the caucuses — holds outsized importance. As the first contest of the primary season, these caucuses strongly indicate how presidential candidates will perform in subsequent states. So those stakes I mentioned earlier? They’re high. 
In anticipation, each candidate’s horde of fervent enthusiasts takes to the streets — and by the streets I mean Twitter — to trash talk the competition. Meanwhile, on Instagram, users can find their friends sporting (pun intended)merch from their favorite candidate. 
There’s perhaps no item as ubiquitous as the fire engine red “Make America Great Again” hat donned by President Donald Trump supporters. However, Democrats can still throw on a Sen. Bernie Sanders T-shirt or sip their morning coffee in one of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s “billionaire tears” mugs.
The factions have names, too: some self-professed and other labels used more widely by opponents. There are “Bernie Bros” for the Democratic Socialists and “Yang Gang” if Andrew Yang’s freedom dividend suits your fancy. 
But nothing encapsulates politics’ evolution into an American pastime to rival the likes of the NFL as much as the color-coding that dominates our conceptions of liberalism and conservatism. On the first day of kindergarten, kids learn the three primary colors: red, yellow and blue. I have to imagine that on their first day of work at CNN or Fox News, new employees find out red and blue are the only colors they needed.
These cultural connotations are so great that in June, the Los Angeles Times published an article titled “The 2020 Democratic debates: A pop of red, a naked neck and a sea of navy blue.” But this phenomenon is hardly limited to the 2020 election cycle. Even in the political off-season, color-coded partisanship remains supreme. 
Color-coding dominates sports arenas across the world as fans visually project their allegiance. This Sunday the scarlet and gold of the San Francisco 49ers will compete with the, hilariously, red and gold of the Kansas City Chiefs. This sports-like culture of modern politics seems inevitable in our partisan world, yet it wasn’t always the case.
In actuality, the red and blue political color scheme that CNN and Fox News graphic designers go wild for was not cemented until the 2000 presidential election. Before then, TV networks switched colors periodically and deviated from this red-blue hegemony. ABC even used yellow to represent Republicans in the 1976 election. 
The sports culture of American politics presents several dilemmas, but the infancy of this red-blue color scheme offers hope. Politics isn’t sports because it isn’t a game. Real lives are attached to the policies each candidate supports. Often, in the process of building a fandom around a candidate and their talking points, we divorce them from the reality their policies represent. 
This sports-like culture sows division. Within a single party, it creates competing factions that become increasingly virulent and not always as a result of legitimate concerns toward policy or qualifications. 
This culture furthers the divide between red and blue, daring us to try and cross that ever-growing line. No matter who wins the 2020 election, this partisanship is toxic. Whichever candidate takes the White House will need to work with a continuously divided Congress to pass legislation they proposed during the election.
As of Nov. 15, the House of Representatives passed nearly 400 bills, 80% of which found themselves collecting dust as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell prioritized partisan grandstanding. This legislative graveyard has been building up for decades. In the ‘70s and ‘80s, Congress passed between 700 and 800 bills every two years. In the past several years, Congress passed 300-500 bills every two years. In 2019, Congress passed just 70.
Partisan sports culture halts the wheels our democracy is constructed upon, and no one wins. But if the world hasn’t always been in red and blue, then I think there’s hope for a cooperative future.

With the March primaries weeks away, one thing is clear: Election season is hurtling toward us. As millennials and Gen Zers quickly become the largest voting blocks in the country, it is even more vital that college students register to vote. 
In theory, registration requires two-five minutes to gather some basic information, such as one’s mailing address and political party. However, there are many voting barriers unique to college students: understanding first-time registration rules, needing to register for the first time in a new state, changing their mailing address, requesting an absentee ballot and wading through many different deadlines that vary by state. 
This is the problem: At a premier research institution like USC with thousands of students from around the country, it’s hard to dole out this information efficiently. Student-run organizations like VoteSC, created specifically to help students register and become civically engaged, work with limited resources.  
Administrators should be working with student-run organizations to reach as many students as possible. Institutions like USC have the resources to engage their students and take great pride in being international leaders in boosting voter education. So, why hasn’t USC taken the same initiative? Why can’t all students find comprehensive voter information on USC’s website, register through a tab on MyUSC or hear about registration from their designated residential faculty? Why hasn’t voting become more institutionalized on campus, and where can we find models that work? 
As far as examples go, we don’t have to look far. Across town, UCLA has been incredibly successful in engaging its student body. In 2018, UCLA became the first University of California campus to offer an online autofill of a California voter registration form through their student portal MyUCLA. The tool allows students to automatically send their registration to the California Secretary of State’s Office. The portal also provides every student access to voter registration, election deadlines and information about changing their campus address. 
Equally as important, the UCLA Registrar’s Office website offers a comprehensive voting guide, complete with information about registration, elections, and California legislators. With accessible links to registration forms — the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder’s Office, State Assembly, House and Senate to name just a few — students have myriad resources at their fingertips. UCLA even has their own voter registration campaign connected to their school’s website and student portal.
It is imperative that students interact with the electoral process in college. Voting is a lifelong duty, a skill that must be practiced and learned until it becomes a habit. Voting and voter education should be celebrated and encouraged at institutions of higher education. Students are not expecting the school to take a partisan stance but are merely asking administrators to acknowledge the significance of voter registration. By working together, record numbers of students will be given a platform to make their voices heard. 
USC is falling behind. It is the school’s responsibility to promote civic engagement so that every student has the opportunity to show up to the polls this November. Every election relies on participation, and 2020 will be no different. Let’s make this one count.
