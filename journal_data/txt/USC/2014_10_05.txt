The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Thursday, Oct. 2, and Friday, Oct. 3.  
Crimes against property
At 12:13 p.m. on Oct. 2, an unsecured iPod was taken from a university vehicle parked outside the Corwin D. Denney Research Center.
At 2:56 p.m. on Oct. 2, a student at Kappa Sigma reported his bicycle missing.
At 11:07 p.m. on Oct. 2, it was reported that a suspect removed a bicycle secured to a bike rack at University Gateway Apartments.
At 11:42 p.m. on Oct. 2, it was reported that a suspect entered an unsecured classroom at Mark Taper Hall of Humanities and removed an unattended backpack.
At 2:31 a.m. on Oct. 3, it was reported that a glass door was shattered at 3036 Hoover Street by unknown means.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 7:42 a.m. on Oct. 2, a radiation alarm was activated at the Keck Hospital of USC.  DPS officers responded and determined that a staff member’s bag caused the alarm to go off.  The staff member was instructed to properly dispose of the bag.
At 6:43 p.m. on Oct. 2, DPS officers responded to a student suffering from bronchitis at Cecele and Michael Birnkrant Residence Hall. An LAFD RA unit was already on scene when officers arrived, and the student was released after declining medical treatment.
 
 
At 7:03 p.m. on Oct. 2, DPS officers responded to claims of someone trespassing at Kaprielian Hall.  After checking the suspect’s name, the officers found that he had been caught trespassing multiple times and subsequently arrested him and detained him for booking.
At 8:34 p.m. on Oct. 2, a staff member at Terrace Apartments collided with a bicyclist while driving a university vehicle.  The bicyclist got off his bike to take a photo of the vehicle license plate then rode away.  There was a small amount of damage to the vehicle.
At 9:39 p.m. on Oct. 2, a traffic collision was reported between a student driving a university vehicle and a non-USC female driving her own vehicle.  Both of the vehicles sustained some damage.
At 11:23 p.m. on Oct. 2, a first floor fire alarm was activated at Alpha Epsilon Pi.  DPS officers and LAFD Unit #15 responded and reset the fire alarm.
At 11:59 p.m. on Oct. 2 , DPS officers responded to a student who injured her ankle while stepping off a curb at 29th Street and Menlo Avenue. The student said she would seek treatment on her own at the Engemann Student Health Center and was transported to her residence by DPS officers.
At 1:38 a.m. on Oct. 3, DPS officers responded to an intoxicated student who was passsed out near 31st Street and Orchard Avenue. The student was unresponsive when contacted by the officers, so an LAFD RA unit was requested, and the student was subsequently transported to California Hospital for medical treatment.

The annual security and fire safety report released last week by the Dept. of Public Safety indicates that violent crimes, including burglary and robbery, have seen a substantial decrease. Reports of sexual assault, however, have increased, as have disciplinary referrals for liquor and drug violations.

The report, released each year in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, requires college campuses to document three calendar years of specific campus crime statistics, including security policies and procedures.
This year’s report is the first released since the university hired Martha Walters as the Clery Compliance Coordinator earlier this year. Walters, who was the main individual responsible for authoring the report, said one big improvement the university has seen is a 47 percent decrease in robberies since 2011.
DPS Chief John Thomas said the majority of robberies occur off campus, but he believes DPS’s weekly communication in statistics meetings, called CommStat, are partly responsible for the decrease, and that students are becoming more informed about how to stay safe off campus.
In recent years, DPS officials, officials from the Los Angeles City Attorney, LAPD officials, Exposition Park police and Figueroa Corridor personnel have worked together to participate in the CommStat weekly strategy meetings about area crime.
“Probably the biggest factor is the continuing educational effort and the investment that the university has made into technology,” Thomas said. “Also our CommStat process where we put together strategies based upon what crimes are reported [help us] deploy our resources based upon those factors.”
Thomas said he believes that closing campus to the public between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m., as well as the addition of at least 60 security ambassadors from 4 p.m. to 6 a.m. seven days a week has helped decrease burglaries, particularly in on-campus residential facilities.
He noted, however, that security measures including card swipes and biometrics in on-campus residential facilities have also led to an increase in liquor- and drug-related referrals because there are more security personnel stationed in the dorms.
“Now that you have all the increased security in the residence halls, they’re now seeing more people come intoxicated, and they’re making the notification to get them some medical assistance,” Thomas said. “Before when you didn’t have that, a student could bring their intoxicated roommate right up to the room and nobody would know any better.”
The number of reported sexual assaults has increased within the last few years. Reported sexual assaults, listed in the report as forcible sex offenses, went from 24 in 2011 to 32 in 2012 to 33 in 2013. Last year’s report made adjustments for forcible sex offenses, a change not noted in the previous year’s report.
DPS Deputy Chief Carlisle said he expects the numbers to continue to fluctuate in part because effective Oct. 1, 2013, the Center for Women and Men, which provides counseling for victims of sexual assault, was no longer designated as a Campus Security Authority, the title given to entities that can file official reports of sexual assault.
“The university wanted to make sure that nothing would discourage a victim of sexual assault from reporting to the Center for Women and Men,” Carlisle said. “We anticipate there will be a decrease in the reported numbers next year.”
Walters noted that the Clery Act stipulates that instances of sexual assault are recorded in the year they are reported. So if a student comes to DPS and reports being sexually assaulted the year prior, it would still fall under this year’s report. She also said this year’s report outlines more information about resources for victims of sexual assault and steps victims can take.
Thomas said that an increase in the number of reported sexual assaults can actually be a positive thing because it means more students are willing to report the crime.
“When it comes to sexual assaults, I’m actually glad that we’re getting more students to come forward and report because it gives us a better perspective of how widespread the issues are, and we can be better equipped to assist in helping do something about it,” Thomas said.
This year’s report also includes categories for domestic violence, dating violence and stalking. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act requires that, as of Jan. 1, 2014, colleges and universities begin collecting data about instances of domestic violence, dating violence and stalking.
USC included some data they collected in those three categories in this year’s report, but officials do expect the numbers to increase once they have more data for next year’s report.
The 58-page report takes time and effort to produce, but Walters noted it gives students and parents an opportunity to compare crime data from different universities.
“I think that directing resources to put together this report requires a university to come together as a whole, the many facets of it — student affairs, student judicial conduct, administration and your department of public safety — to put this information together to put it out there to the public for consumption,” Walters said.
Thomas said that the report gives an overview of USC’s security and allows students to make informed decisions regarding their personal safety.
“Despite incidents that may make the news, that we look at as those things that can happen anywhere in America, the reality is this allows a context,” Thomas said. “If people take the time to read it and digest it and use it for what it’s worth to make an educated decision as to whether or not the university environment is safe, it will give them the tools they need to make the decisions that are best for them.”

USC organizations hosted Football 101, an event designed to help students get a better understanding of the game and culture of American football, at Heritage Hall on Friday.

USC Program Board’s International Student Assembly, Graduate Student Government and Recreational Sports collaborated to host the event, with sponsorship from the Office of International Services and others.
“Beat the Sun Devils” T-shirts and tote bags, as well as free game tickets, were passed out to the 100 participants.
USG Wellness kicked off the event by talking about tailgating policies and safety. GSG organized a tailgate on Trousdale Parkway so all the participants of the event could experience the chaos and Trojan spirit for themselves on game day.
Donald Ludwig, executive director of USC Spirit and Traditions and USC Spirituality and Sports, and Luis Nevarez, a senior safety on the Trojan football team, talked about what it means to be a part of the Trojan family. They went on to explain the game of football, everything from specifying the dimensions of the field to creating an interactive activity for the audience to understand the snap count. While a football helmet was being passed around the room, Ludwig and Nevarez helped the event’s participants feel like they would be able to yell and chant with the rest of the Trojans at the ASU game.
The event ended with a jock rally and performances from the Trojan Marching Band and the Song Girls.
“This is actually an annual event, and we at GSG wanted to continue this because we wanted to get the students accustomed to American culture as well as USC culture,” GSG President Yohey Tokumitsu said.
He said that another purpose of the event was to familiarize international students with tailgating culture.
While this event had been held in years past, this was the first time a number of USC organizations collaborated on it.
“I asked the Office of International Services, and they led me to speak to Athletics, as well as Rec Sports, ISA and USG. They were very helpful and eager to work on this project with us,” Tokumitsu said.
Rachel Zou, director of ISA, believed that there was a great deal of student demand for an event like this, especially because of their efforts to increase publicity for Football 101 this year. Four hundred undergraduate and graduate students at USC RSVP’d for the event. Because of limited capacity, the 100 participants were chosen through a lottery system.
“I think there is a lot of student demand [for an event like this], especially for free football tickets,” Zou said. “I think there is also a lot of student demand among international students to understand how football works because football is a foreign concept to people outside of America. I grew up in America, but I am not an avid football fan. I came to USC and had no idea what the rules of football were, so Football 101 has really helped me understand that.”
Participant feedback was positive.
“I think I will understand more and enjoy the game more because I’ll know what and when to cheer,” said Jolie Vu, a graduate student at the Leventhal School of Accounting. “They should definitely have this event every year.”
Students who had previously attended football games also found the event to be helpful.
“The workshop was great,” said Danshi Li, a graduate student in mechanical engineering. “I’ve seen a lot of football games at USC, but this will be really helpful for the game tomorrow because it’s clearer how to be integrated into the Trojan community and cheer with everyone.”
 
I think everyone should take a class like this at SC. How can one not do so? It’s SC, c’mon! Honestly, I need to take this class because I want to clear my technical ignorance of football. I want to know more than the nitty gritty of football such as TDs, incompletes, picks, turnovers, etc. I want to learn about all the positions and their unique functions….

On Sunday, the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation hosted the Trojans for sChange Conference, welcoming social justice-focused student organizations to learn about leadership and organizational strategies and discuss how to make change.
Speaking out · Maria Rodriguez, left, a junior majoring in NGOs and social change, and Brianna Thorpe, right, a sophomore majoring in business administration, speak at the Trojans for sChange Conference this weekend. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
“We’re hoping to get good conversation going about what it really takes to make change at this university because a lot of student groups face similar issues across the board when they bring up change to administration and try to get involved in activist causes,” said Sarah Newell, a member of SCALE’s leadership team.
Workshops included sessions on collective liberation, creative tactics and action direction, leadership development and making cultural change. University employees as well as the USC Chicano Student Movement of Aztlán and Queer People of Color also led discussions on the mission of and challenges faced by USC cultural assemblies.
More than 40 attendees representing 21 campus organizations — including Black Student Assembly, Women’s Student Assembly and the Diversity Affairs division of Undergraduate Student Government — as well as groups from Whittier College and Clergy & Laity United for Economic Justice attended the event. Newell said that both new organizations and those that have been established for longer periods of time could benefit from working together to address common issues.
“SCALE has been around for 15 years, but a lot we can do better, especially having a four-year turnaround period at a university,” Newell said. “But especially for newer groups, talking about leadership and how to get younger folks to understand everything you’ve learned — so not a huge learning curve — is helpful.”
Morgan Mamon, a member of SCALE, STAND and co-president of GlobeMed, said she attended the conference to learn about how she can implement local change, particularly in GlobeMed, which is primarily focused on providing foreign aid.
One way the conference addressed the issue of initiating local change was through a conversation in which university employees shared their experience working for the school. One of the employees, who wished to remain anonymous, spoke about the hardship of receiving only $12.80 per hour after working for the university for seven years. Despite holding a job, he remains homeless, unable to afford permanent housing with his current salary.
He said one of his favorite parts of his job is greeting students in the morning and when students recognize him and start a conversation. He said, however, that he feels the university stifles these relationships.
“I work hard, really damn hard,” the employee said. “But we’re told not to speak to students or to communicate with you guys. I guess you would call it corporate segregation. They don’t want you guys to know what we’re doing in the back or for us to know what you’re doing at school.”
The conversation brought awareness of local labor exploitation to students like Brianna Thorpe, a sophomore majoring in business administration. The group also discussed the disparity between USC’s $6 billion fundraising initiative and the amount that USC employees are paid.
“With SCALE I think of factories in Bangladesh, and we need to fight those, but when you hear about people in your own campus being exploited, I don’t know what to say,” Thorpe said.
Whether organizations in attendance were striving to make political or social change at the global or local level, many attendees agreed that it is necessary to come together and utilize the resources they have by working together. Rhea LaFleur, a sophomore majoring in sociology who is involved in WSA, says it will be a great resource to have the opportunity to collaborate with other social justice groups.
“We share a lot of the same beliefs, but don’t spend time communicating with one another,” LaFleur said. “The fact [that we’re] working together today will make our efforts a lot stronger.”

It’s no secret that USC’s School of Cinematic Arts is a breeding ground for new and burgeoning talent. Director George Lucas (Star Wars), producer Brian Grazer (A Beautiful Mind) and screenwriter David S. Goyer (The Dark Knight trilogy) have all walked SCA’s hallowed halls. While success often comes after an education at SCA, this isn’t so for two sophomores in the Interactive Media and Games division: Keenan Mosimann and Zach Suite.
Face to face · Despite the relatively low quality of the graphics, Close Your compensates by giving individual faces to all of the characters. The most innovative part of the game, however, is the feature that jumps the game forward every time the player blinks causing virtual life to fly by. – Photo courtesy of Keenan Mosimann 
Mosimann has been an active contributor in the gaming world for more than six years — he curates a YouTube game channel with more than 500,000 followers under the name Criken. Both Mosimann and Suite were in an Intro to Game Development class taught by Margaret Moser last year when the class‘s student assistant told them about a technology he had been working on. Then-senior Will Hellwarth had just taken a demo from Mixamo, a 3-D game animation company in San Francisco, and reconfigured it to read and respond to someone’s eyes using the built-in web camera in a computer — an innovative idea that had never been tested live before. Mosimann asked Hellwarth if they could further expand the use of the technology, and Suite, who had worked with Hellwarth on a previous project, jumped on board to join Hellwarth’s company, Goodbyeworld Games.
After an extremely brief development cycle of two months, the group came up with Close Your — a self-described “first-person tragedy” that takes the game player through an entire life span of an ambiguous character who has memory loss. The catch? Every time the player blinks, the game jumps forward and the player loses a chunk in time. Described as sort of the game version of the film Boyhood, which depicts a fictionalized childhood filmed over a period of 12 years, Mossiman said that “you can’t help but watch [the game] fly right before your eyes.”
Mosimann, Suite and Hellwarth acknowledge they’re a small team and the visuals are very simple; however, they combat this by making the game purposefully stylized, providing individual faces for each of the various characters despite the fact that everyone’s head is shaped like a block. The game is different for every player and gameplay lasts about 15 to 20 minutes, depending on how much the player blinks. If the player chooses to talk to one person a lot in the beginning of his life, that person will be in their wedding. But if he chooses someone else to talk to, then it will be that character instead. Mossiman says there’s this “huge branching story that you can’t get through one play-through,” and that’s why it can be played over and over again. After making the game, the group had to ask: What’s next?
IndieCade — often called “the Sundance of Game Festivals” — is a four-day independent festival that takes place every October in Culver City. More than 150 featured games are chosen for display as both industry professionals and game players alike come out to test and enjoy the various events.
The group applied to IndieCade not expecting anything to happen, but was overjoyed to learn they had been accepted to exhibit. They’re using IndieCade as a test to see how the new technology plays with audiences, assess the feedback from developers and media and hope it’s positive enough to use as grounds for developing a company. Suite and Mosimann said they had a lot of ideas for how to employ the technology on different platforms and games. Mosimann also plans to link his connections with YouTube — an avenue he says is especially advantageous because most content uploaders only use webcams for their videos. Mosimann said they’re also very excited to bring Close Your to “anyone who’s looking for a new an innovative way to play a game.”
While Mosimann is excited, Suite says he’s also anxious about exhibiting their game this weekend. But for now, they must continue to focus; the team will be busy honing and working on new aspects right up until the festival begins on Thursday. For the last month they’ve worked to change and refine the details of the game, even changing the story to be less linear and more emotional. They’ve also polished visuals and attempted to make the game more interactive in hopes of immersing the player more fully into the world. They like to call Close Your an “interactive poem of sorts” in which one of the goals is to make people cry. Whether they successfully complete their goal still remains to be seen this weekend, but it’s clear these sophomores still have a bright future ahead.

If breakup songs were like apple pie, Taylor Swift would be Marie Callender. She has manufactured the perfect, sticky-sweet formula that turns breakup anthems into ubiquitous hits for the under under-16 crowd. There isn’t much in the realm of good man-hating, breakup music for those who seem to have outgrown teenage heartbreak and are looking for something a little more sophisticated. Enter Zeta Wave, an Indie-pop/dance singer-songwriter and her Seattle band who may have turned the tables on grown-up millennial breakup music.
So “Over” it · Zeta Wave brings synth-heavy, emotional songs, her vocals blend with the production to produce the sound of 80’s pop singers. – Photo courtesy of Noisetrade
 
Her 6-track EP, “Over,” is a synth-driven collection of dreamy beats and haunting vocals that put her past relationship experiences in the spotlight. Chronicling the last few years of her life, “Over” is a killer EP that’s got all the right amounts of dance, pop and mature lyrics that will surely soothe relationship woes. Fortunately for all those who are embarrassed to still be crying alongside T. Swift, “Over” brings up just enough moody attitude to be the perfect grown-up breakup EP.
With synth-driven dance music becoming much more mainstream, and the sounds of a real guitar more rare by the second, making an EP that will cause a splash in the unforgiving world of radio-hit EDM has become increasingly difficult. While Zeta Wave, the stage name of Aliya Hashemi, isn’t quite making beats following in Avicii’s footsteps, she is capitalizing on how there are barely any female producers making songs that girls can relate to — a gap in the genre that could catapult her and her EP to stardom.
The EP opens with “Strange Heartbeat,” a tune reminiscent of girl pop wonders of the ’80s like Kim Carnes. Zeta Wave’s throaty vocals pair perfectly with the sleepy pop beat as she bemoans a lost love who had even let her meet his mom. This opener sets the tone for the entire EP.
Unfortunately, “Over’s” weak spot turns up just as the final chords of “Strange Heartbeat” close. “Cliché” is a campy, sticky-sweet, unoriginal undying love anthem that is way too far away from the Lily Allen-esque lyrics present throughout the rest of the EP. Ironically, Zeta Wave assures listeners that the relationship she’s describing in “Over’s” second dance pop song doesn’t have to fall under any old category. Unfortunately for her, the gag-worthy lyrics claiming “you feel like Christmas morning / and I was six years old,” are exactly the kind of cliché novice singer songwriters should be trying to avoid. But the catchy “Cliché” is far from this album’s pitfall. While it is undoubtedly the weakest track on the EP, it will surely be played in countless cars while drivers focus on the fun dance-worthy beat and tune out the cloying lyrics.
After that quick nose-dive, Zeta Wave comes zooming back up with sassy vocals alongside a punchy beat in “Waltz.” This tightly produced track makes listeners want to nod their heads along :whether they’re running on the treadmill or just doing homework.  Recently released as her second single off of the EP, “Waltz” gives new listeners a perfect glimpse into the whimsical, high-energy world that Zeta Wave’s music seems to have been meant to accompany.
Along with “Strange Heartbeat,” “Girls” is a quintessential girl power breakup song. With fun upbeat guitars, drums and synthesizers that work perfectly with strong vocals, the lyrics “When it’s over / there’s no mistaking it / there’s a fork in the road / and I’m taking it,” have just enough punch.
In a departure from everything else on the EP, the final song, “Birthday,” introduces a new sound to the album. Devoid of the upbeat dance beats found on the other tracks, “Birthday” features soft falsetto vocals paired with an acoustic guitar and crooning backup vocals.
Zeta Wave is easily filling the hole that has appeared in between mainstream D.J.s and teenybopper pop singers. While she probably won’t be playing any major EDM festivals or headlining her own stadium tour anytime soon, she is definitely an up-and-coming musician with the potential to become a driving force in her genre. If she stays true to form of “Over”  and maintains this level of fun, upbeat production and truthful and relatable lyrics, Zeta Wave has the perfect formula to crank out radio hits.
In an interview with the Examiner, Hashemi calls Zeta Wave’s own sound “bedroom dance pop,” and this couldn’t be a more perfect description. Perfect to get through a breakup, or just to drive around town with the windows down, “Over” is a great EP for anyone looking for something a little different but still approachable. Although “Strange Heartbeat” and “Waltz” have already been released as singles, the rest of the EP will be available for download off of Zeta Wave’s website on Oct. 14.

Though all of his songs are sung completely in French, one word that is making its way into the American English vocabulary is “Stromae.”  Stromae, the Belgian hip-hop sensation who gained most of his popularity in Europe, brought his sold-out U.S. tour to the Fonda Theatre in Hollywood on Oct. 4 and 5.
Stromae, a singer, songwriter and composer, left the audience transfixed and excited for the full two-hour show of his electronic dance beats and showmanship. Stromae proved he is far more than just a singer and a composer — he is an entertainer. With each new song he performed he became a new character, often undergoing a wardrobe change in the process.
For example, when performing his hit, “Tous les mêmes,” which in English translates to “All the same,” Stromae applied make-up and jewelry to one side of himself, and integrated dance moves into his choreography that demonstrated both feminine and masculine demeanors. During his encore performance of “Papaoutai,” which roughly translates to “Dad, where are you?” a song about the difficulty in defining parenthood and how everyone ends up like their parents, Stromae was carried onto the stage, dressed as a doll and performed some of his most impressive dancing of the evening. In “Formidable,” which translates to “Wonderful” and is a song about the effects of loneliness and the absence of relationships, Stromae stumbled onto the stage with his hair askew and shirt wrinkled. Throughout the song he acted as if he were inebriated and eventually after the last note of the song, began violently coughing and collapsed onto the stage as his fellow musicians had to drag him off the stage only to return for the next song in his bow tie and boyish grin. Each song he performed had its own individual story and was a unique experience.
With the changing of his appearance after each song also came the change of the sets. Though each set had interesting designs and colors and lights throughout, the one recurring theme was the use of shadows. Stromae, with his very distinct tall, gangly frame, along with the four musicians that joined him onstage dressed in bowler hats and bow ties, made interesting and distinct shadows on the various backdrops throughout the show.
The set began with “Ta fête,” a song that was selected as the official anthem of the Belgian soccer team for the 2014 World Cup. He mostly played songs from his most recent album, Racine Carrée, which translates to “Square Root,” but included the biggest hits off of his last album including “Alors on danse” and “Peace or Violence.” Throughout the show, aside from the singing and dancing, Stromae also played various instruments: including the keyboard and the drums.
The highlight of the show came at the very end during the second encore.  He set down his microphone, called the other four musicians out from behind their instruments, and told the audience to be completely silent. Though Stromae had already performed the crowd pleaser “Tous les mêmes,” with its infectious electronic dance beat and catchy tune earlier in his set, he and the other four musicians began singing the tune again completely a capella. They had no instruments, no props, no backdrops and no theatrics and it was still just as good, if not better, than the rest of the set. It was almost Stromae’s way of showing that yes, he is an entertainer and a dancer, but if you strip that away, he is, first and foremost, a singer and a songwriter. Stromae has a vocal range that is uncommon of artists in the rap and hip-hop genres.
Building his fame on singing songs only in French created an interesting problem for Stromae in catering to both English and French speakers, and he handled it like a pro. There were no tedious translations of every interaction he had with the crowd, but instead he would seamlessly transition from French to English and back again, making everyone in the room feel part of the show.  One of the most incredible parts about the show was the audience Stromae attracted. There were children in elementary school standing next to couples in their fifties and sixties standing next to college students. Not everyone spoke the same language, but everyone understood Stromae’s message and appreciated his art.
Though Stromae’s music dabbles in the hip-hop, rap and electronic genres, unlike most of his counterparts, he does not put forth messages about drug use, partying or promiscuity, but instead tackles social issues in an eloquent and relatable way. He is able to communicate these ideas about things including war, paternity and gender through his songs, movement and the spectacle he creates in order to make them understandable and relevant.

USC’s men’s and women’s tennis teams found success competing in their respective ITA All-American tournaments over the past week.
The women’s team played at the Riviera Tennis Club in Pacific Palisades, California. Senior Zoë Scandalis, who is ranked No. 15 in the nation, was the sole representative in the main singles draw for USC. In the first round, Scandalis cruised past Princeton’s No. 67-ranked Lindsay Graff, 6-1, 6-0. This put her through to the Round of 16, where she fell to third-ranked Hayley Carter of UNC, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2.
Scandalis couldn’t dwell on the loss, though, as she had to turn around and keep playing in the doubles draw with her partner, junior Giuliana Olmos. Olmos and Scandalis, ranked No. 7 in the nation together now, made it to the finals of this tournament last year, and were looking to repeat their success. This year, the squad earned a bye in the first round of competition. They got off on the right foot in the Round of 16 on Oct. 2 defeating Cal’s No. 11-ranked Maegan Manasse and Denise Starr, 6-0, 6-4.
Olmos and Scandalis, who went 22-8 overall together last season, came up against Michigan’s 14th-ranked team of Sarah Lee and Ronit Yurovsky, and took home a 6-2, 7-5 win.
This earned the duo a spot in the semifinals against Stanford’s Taylor Davidson and Carol Zhao. Davidson and Zhao, who went 29-6 together last season, pulled off a straight sets win over Olmos and Scandalis, 7-6, 6-2.
The men’s team was just as busy playing in the ITA Men’s All-American Championships in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
The Trojans earned three spots in the main singles draw and had one squad playing in the main doubles draw. Seniors Yannick Hanfmann, Roberto Quiroz and Jonny Wang all earned automatic bids to the tournament.
Hanfmann, ranked No. 2 in the nation, has not dropped a set yet in five matches for this tournament and earned a spot in the finals with a 6-3, 6-3 win over No. 20 Romain Bogaerts of Wake Forest on Sunday. He will face Louisville’s Sebastian Stiefelmeyer in the finals, who is ranked No. 110 in the nation.
In the first round, Hanfmann beat No. 36 Florian Lakat of Mississippi State, 6-2, 6-4. That win earned him a matchup against Texas’ No. 31 Lloyd Glasspool, where he pulled off a 6-1, 6-1 win. Hanfmann then advanced to the Round of 16, where he beat Harvard’s No. 18 Denis Nguyen, 6-0, 6-3. In the quarterfinals, he steamrolled Duke’s Nicolas Alvarez, 6-1, 6-1.
In typical fashion for the San Marino, California, native, Wang pulled off an impressive upset in the first round, beating Texas A&M’s No. 11-ranked Harrison Adams, 6-3, 6-3. In the Round of 32, he faced Texas Tech’s Felipe Soares, ranked No. 43 in the nation, and prevailed by a 6-3, 6-3 score again. But Wang fell to No. 17-ranked Nathan Pasha of Georgia by a 6-3, 6-4 score to end his tournament run.
Quiroz was on the other end of an upset in the first round, falling to Notre Dame’s No. 88 Quentin Monaghan. The Ecuadorian had more success in doubles, though, teaming up with Hanfmann to make the finals of the tournament.
The duo topped ranked teams from Indiana, Florida State and Vanderbilt to reach the semifinals on Sunday against Texas A&M’s Jeremy Efferding and Jordan Szabo. The Trojans prevailed, 6-1, 6-4, to earn a spot in today’s final against Tennessee’s Hunter Reese and Mikelis Libietis, the top-ranked doubles squad in the nation.
The singles final will kick off at 8 a.m. today and the doubles final begins at 11 a.m. today.
 
UPDATE:
Senior Yannick Hanfmann fell to Louisville’s No. 110 Sabastian Stiefelmeyer in the singles finals on Monday. No. 2 Hanfmann had not dropped a set all tournament, but was upset, 6-3, 6-2 by the Austrian who made his way through the qualifying rounds and all the way to the championship.Hanfmann had his hands full again in the doubles final later in the day. Hanfmann and Quiroz, ranked No. 19 together, took on the defending ITA All-American doubles champions, Tennessee’s top-ranked Mikelis Libietis and Hunter Reese. The Trojans came up empty handed, losing 6-3, 6-4.

The USC golf teams both begin tournaments today, with the women taking on top competition at the Windy City Collegiate Classic and the men teeing off in the Nike Golf Collegiate Invitational.

The No. 1 Women of Troy, last year’s NCAA runner-up, finished in sixth place at the season-opening ANNIKA Intercollegiate without several key players. Junior Annie Park, a two-time All-American, will return to the team this week, while junior Kyung Kim is still out of the lineup.
Senior Doris Chen and sophomore Karen Chung led the way for USC in Kim and Park’s absence, tying for 11th individually at the ANNIKA Intercollegiate with scores of 1-under. Chen, Chung, Park and sophomores Elizabeth Doty and Gabriella Then will make up the lineup for the Women of Troy in this week’s tournament. Doty, a transfer from Wake Forest, shot a combined 3-over in her first event with USC, good for a 25th-place tie.
Joining the Women of Troy at the Westmoreland C.C. in Wilmette, Illinois, will be No. 9 Arizona, No. 17 Northwestern, No. 18 Oklahoma State and No. 23 Ohio State. Last season, USC overcame a dramatic scorecard error from Park to outlast Oklahoma and win the Windy City Classic. This year’s event will run through Tuesday and can be followed on golfstat.com.
The No. 23 men’s team has already found success this season, recording top-two finishes in both of its first two tournaments. Sophomore standout Rico Hoey built upon an outstanding rookie campaign in last week’s Itani Quality Homes Collegiate hosted by Washington State. Hoey tied for third place individually while the Trojans fell to Oregon in a two-team playoff.
At this week’s Nike Collegiate Invitational, USC will face host TCU, along with a collection of top teams that includes No. 2 Stanford and No. 8 Washington. The Cardinal made it all the way to the NCAA semifinals last season, while the Trojans finished in 30th.
Along with Hoey, head coach Chris Zambri’s lineup features senior Eric Sugimoto, junior Bobby Gojuangco, and freshmen Jonah Texeira and Sean Crocker. Texeira was excellent at last week’s event, tying with Gojuangco for 10th-place at 1-under in only his second collegiate event. The score was also a career-best for Gojuangco, a transfer from San Diego State who joined Zambri’s squad last season.
The Trojans will play two full rounds today with another to come on Tuesday. Play at the Colonial C.C. in Fort Worth, Texas, can also be followed on golfstat.com.

It was a top-five matchup in the Uytengsu Aquatics Center on Saturday, when No. 4 USC took on No. 5 UC Santa Barbara. In the Trojans’ (12-2, 2-0 MPSF) first game at home this season after playing on the road for four straight weeks, the team took out the Gauchos by a final score of 14-5.
Newbie · Freshman goalkeeper McQuin Baron continued his domination against the Gauchos, recording 12 saves. Baron now has 102 in his career. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
UCSB opened the scoring with a 6-on-5 goal, but USC responded quickly with two goals of its own to take a 2-1 lead. The Trojans went on a 5-0 scoring run soon after, and their lead was 9-2 at the half. In the third, the Trojans and Gauchos split two goals apiece, making the score 11-4 at the end of the period. USC was in complete control in the fourth frame, scoring three goals to the Gauchos’ one.
The last time the Trojans played UCSB, the match was much more contested and resulted in a 12-7 Trojan victory in the Kap7 NorCal Classic earlier this season.
Head coach Jovan Vavic believes his team’s improved performance against the Gauchos is due to  differences in preparing for a tournament versus preparing for a single game.
“I think we are a little bit more prepared today because when we played them last time, we didn’t know who we were going to play because it was dependent on what they did in the game before, so we really were not preparing for them,” Vavic said. “We were getting ready for any opponent.”
In the first half of Saturday’s game alone, nine different Trojans scored each of the team’s goals. Vavic believes that sharing the wealth is key to his team’s success.
“That is the strength of our team, and every coach likes to see more people score,” Vavic said. “Everybody knows [senior driver] Kostas [Genidounias] is our main guy, and everyone is going to try to shut him down, so having so many different people score was big. We hope we continue to do that.”
It was a significant win for USC, but also for several of the Trojan players, including freshman goalie McQuin Baron. The last time the two teams played, Baron had a career-high 15 saves. On Saturday he picked up 12 more.
Baron believes this success is rooted in his focus and discipline.
“Every week I try and prepare as best I can, watch video on each shooter on their offense just what they’re doing, learn how they’re trying to play,” Baron said.
Vavic is very happy with this rookie’s progress.
“He did an excellent job today,” Vavic said. “He was very focused. He did a good job not only blocking the shots but making some good passes in the counterattack. Baron is a special talent. He’s the backbone of our defense. Very pleased with his performance today.”
In addition to Baron’s big day, one of the game’s biggest moments came when Genidounias scored the first of his three goals and became USC’s second all-time leading scorer, breaking his tie with former Trojan Juraj Zatovic. Genidounias was humble about the achievement, however, saying that winning was his only priority.
“Before the game it was on my mind, but it wasn’t as important as getting the win,” Genidounias said. “It was a team effort. I don’t score the goals by myself. Someone has to give me the pass, so it’s a good team effort and I scored a few goals, and I’m up there at number two. It’s good with me but not as important as winning.”
The game was even more special because it was officially the first ever in the newly completed USC facility. Vavic was very pleased with the new arena.
“It’s great,” Vavic said. “I think it’s a very special place now because it’s so beautiful, so perfect for water polo. We have been looking forward to playing here for a while now so it was exciting. You could tell our guys are excited the way they started the game.”
USC will play in the SoCal Tournament hosted by UCLA next week. After Saturday’s win, the Trojans are confident they will perform better than they did in their last tournament, the NorCal Classic, which resulted in a fourth place finish.
Genidounias believes he and his team can keep up the success they have had in the past two weeks.
“We hope to go back to that tournament and have a better showing than in the NorCal tournament,” Genidounias said. “I think that now with all of our new players having a few extra games and learning the system, that’s a key for us for our new players to feel more comfortable in the system with each other. I think we’re going to be a little bit of a tougher team than we were in the NorCal Tournament.”
Baron also believes that even two weeks more experience for him and his young team is invaluable.
“I think we’re definitely more prepared now,” Baron said. “We had more time together. We’re a very young team, so we’re still learning how to play with each other and work as a unit. But we’re definitely coming together better day by day.”

With about eight minutes left in the USC-Arizona State game, I had my entire column planned out. USC was driving, chewing up the clock with a powerful running attack against a worn-out Arizona State defense. Maybe USC head coach Steve Sarkisian’s maddening offensive calls for three quarters had a purpose, to wear down a team. It worked against OSU and was working at that point. I was planning to write about the disparity in national perception between the SEC and Pac-12.

Oregon loses a close game to an underrated Arizona team and football nation clamors about the “soft” Pac-12. Meanwhile, Texas A&M gets run off the field and Alabama loses a close one, and it is all about the strength of the SEC. The respective disparity between Arizona and Oregon and Ole Miss and Alabama is about equal. Strangely enough, coming into Saturday, Arizona was unranked and Ole Miss was knocking on the door of the top 10. Yet, on the flick of one throw by USC redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler throw, that all changed.
East Coast bias, upsets and everything else didn’t matter the minute USC ran a bubble screen to junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor that stalled the fourth quarter drive. After that was one of the most embarrassing collapses in recent history.
Being a diehard sports fan is a funny thing. There is nothing quite like the feeling of victory. Big plays and even bigger wins elevate you to a level euphoria unreachable by anything else. That’s why we root so hard, why we spend time thinking about a game we have zero control over. We do it because we are in search of that elusive feeling of the purest joy you get from rushing the field against Stanford or pounding a hated rival 50-0.
The last five minutes of Saturday’s game was as diametrically opposed to that feeling as humanly possible. Bewilderment. Frustration. Anger. Those words can’t possibly encompass or do justice to the feeling Trojan nation had as ASU wide receiver Jaelen Strong strode in untouched through a sea of red defenders to effectively end any postseason dreams this season.
The saddest part about this game is that from the moment ASU quarterback Michael Bercovici and the Sun Devils crossed midfield when it was 27-18, I knew in my gut that USC was going to lose. When redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen broke through for his 53-yard touchdown, I didn’t celebrate. The only thing I was thinking was, “USC scored too early.”
That is a testament to the absolute lack of confidence most fans had at that point. Up by 12 with less than three minutes remaining when the opposing team has zero timeouts is as close to insurmountable as you are going to get in football. Yet, there was little doubt that if anyone could blow it, it would be this defensive coaching staff on this day.
This game is right up there in the hall of shame with Texas in the national championship, the “what’s your deal” Stanford blowout, and the 62-51 loss to Oregon with Lane and Monte Kiffin at the helm. At least in those games, USC lost because of an opponent’s superhuman performance or great coaching or a phenomenal offense. Tonight, USC lost because of sheer incompetence on the part of the coaching staff.
On Saturday, USC basically lost to a backup quarterback and one very talented wide receiver. They played like the second coming of what I imagine Steve Young and Jerry Rice looked like back in the day. Sure, Bercovici and Strong are both talented, but they aren’t that good.
I’m no defensive expert, nor do I claim to be. Defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox is supposed to be, and he is certainly paid like one. Yet, USC rushed three or four guys on essentially every play on the last three drives. One might posit that after two touchdown drives, a blitz or even throwing in a fourth down lineman to rush might be a decent idea.
A team with the talent of USC shouldn’t have fans legitimately worried when the opposing team gets the ball back with 23 seconds and 72 yards to go.
Yet, with nine seconds left almost every fan in the stadium was thinking the same thing: cover Strong. Even so, he somehow remained practically invisible to the defenders on the field. The Hail Mary alone wasn’t that surprising — the last five minutes as a whole were what shocked me.
Five games into the Sarkisian era, and I have no idea what the Trojans’ identity is. I don’t think any fan does. The team tries to be efficient on offense, and then shoots itself in the foot with drops, questionable play calls and untimely penalties. Promising drives are stalled in the name of slowing down the game to conserve the defense’s energy. Excitement is nonexistent, save for a few infrequent occasions. Big plays are as rare as they are fleeting. Kessler rumbling in for a score, Agholor breaking across the middle of the field, Allen waltzing into the end zone, and sophomore linebacker Su’a Cravens in the opponent’s backfield is what we got Saturday. That shouldn’t be the case with the athletes USC has at its disposal.
On defense, it seems that the coaches are so concerned with stopping one facet of the game that they forget to pay attention to everything else. Against Boston College it was the pass, only to get gashed on the ground. Tonight, the Trojans sold out to stop the run, only to get burned time and time again on play action throws.
Generally, I’m as optimistic as it gets when it comes to USC football. Coming into the game, I was still charting ’SC’s path to the playoff. There wasn’t much to be excited about, though, after that game.
A weekend when Alabama, Oregon and Oklahoma all lose should foreshadow a week of revelry. Instead it is a week of apathy. If it’s hard to even muster up a smile as Utah lays the wood on UCLA, you know something is wrong. Even so, I’ll be back next week hoping there are some answers in the Tucson desert.

In a Saturday evening at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum marked by sloppy play and good fortune for USC, the Trojans’ luck ran out as time expired in the fourth quarter. With less than three minutes remaining in the game, Arizona State quarterback Mike Bercovici scored a quick touchdown, got the ball back with 23 seconds remaining and threw a Hail Mary pass as time expired to pull out a shocking upset of the No. 16 USC Trojans, 38-34, before a stunned crowd of more than 70,000.
Jael Mary · Arizona State quarterback Mike Bercovici connected with wide receiver Jaelen Strong (21) on a 47-yard Hail Mary as time expired on Saturday night. Strong finished with 202 receiving yards and three touchdowns in ASU’s 38-34 win, its first at the Coliseum since 1999. – Tony Zhou | Daily Trojan
With the game favoring the Trojans 34-32 and seven seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Bercovici launched the ball 46 yards into a sea of cardinal-clad USC defenders and essentially prayed that his receiver came down with the ball. His prayer was answered — ASU wide receiver Jaelen Strong caught the ball right outside the end zone and slipped past a dumbstruck group of USC defenders into the end zone.
“It was an awkward Hail Mary,” said USC head coach Steve Sarkisian. “The ball floated back to the middle of the field and it was a heck of a play by [Strong] tracking the ball and making the play on it.”
For Bercovici, it was a triumphant bounce-back after a rough outing against UCLA last week, where the second-string quarterback managed 488 yards through the air but fumbled the ball and threw two interceptions, one of which was returned 95 yards for a touchdown. Bercovici’s efforts come after the Sun Devils suffered a huge blow with the loss of starting quarterback Taylor Kelly to injury.
After their loss to UCLA last week, the Sun Devils fell out of the national rankings and the national playoff conversation. ASU head coach Todd Graham, however, kept faith in his second-string quarterback — and credited his talented backup signal caller for staying with the program.
“For all those young kids out there, everyone tells [backup quarterbacks] to transfer or quit because you’re not getting to play,” Graham said. “Look at Mike Bercovici. He didn’t quit. He chose to stay a Sun Devil. He would’ve missed out on the greatest moment of his football career if he had transferred. I’m so proud of him.”
What eventually became Bercovici’s finest moment thus far as a Sun Devil actually began as the quarterback’s less-than-perfect throw.
“I’ve never been able to throw a Hail Mary before,” Bercovici said. “I didn’t think I threw it well. It looked like a duck. But my God, I didn’t know what happened, to be honest.”
Bercovici didn’t throw too many ducks en route to 510 yards and five touchdowns, but those numbers were also due in large part to the efforts of Strong, who hauled in 10 receptions for 202 yards and three touchdowns, including the game-winning Hail Mary.
“I saw the ball in the air, and the first thing I thought was, ‘I’m going to get this,’” Strong said. “At first I thought, ‘I don’t know if I can get to it,’ but I put my head down and kept running and got it.”
Strong was also complimentary of his teammates, eschewing any notion that he had won the game by himself.
“If [ASU running back D.J. Foster] doesn’t make that TD, we don’t have that chance. If [ASU wide receiver Cameron Smith] doesn’t make that TD, we don’t have that chance. If [ASU wide receiver Gary Chambers] doesn’t make that big play to set us up for the Hail Mary, we don’t have that chance,” Strong said.
For USC, it will be the “what ifs” that torture them after Saturday’s game. The game was characterized by missed opportunities for both teams. Bercovici overthrew two would-be touchdowns to Foster and Strong, the latter on a post route with virtually no Trojan defender ahead of him. USC’s defense looked confused on the last play of the game, and Sarkisian admitted in a post-game press conference that the Trojans were attempting to prepare for both a Hail Mary or a short completion and field goal situation, despite there being seven seconds remaining in the game and ASU having exhausted all of its time outs. The Hail Mary wasn’t USC’s only missed opportunity: Earlier in the game, redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler had a drive cut short and missed out on a potential touchdown both due to dropped passes from sophomore wide receiver Darreus Rogers.
On the defensive side of the ball, the Trojans were effective against the run, holding Foster and the rest of the Sun Devil rushing attack to 31 total yards. USC’s game plan appeared to dare ASU’s fledgling backup quarterback to attack through the air, and Bercovici made the Trojans’ secondary pay.
The Trojans were not without some lucky breaks of their own: USC’s drive in the second quarter was assisted by some curious refereeing. Redshirt junior punter Kris Albarado fell on his own after a kick on fourth down and managed to get a penalty against ASU to extend a drive that would eventually lead to a touchdown from redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen. That drive shifted the game’s momentum in favor of the Trojans, who would have narrowly escaped with the victory if not for ASU’s last second touchdown.
Allen turned in another big performance, despite getting off to a slow start. The starting tailback had 38 yards on 14 carries for a subpar 2.7 yards per carry average at the half, but quickly turned things around to finish with 229 total yards from scrimmage (143 rushing yards and 86 yards receiving) and two rushing touchdowns.
Kessler attempted 28 passes by halftime, and finished the game having completed 28 of his career-high 45 attempts for 273 yards and a season-low 62 percent completion percentage. No USC receiver broke 100 yards receiving, as ASU dropped multiple defenders into coverage schemes designed to prevent big plays. The Trojans didn’t help their own cause much, as penalties were again an issue for USC — the Trojans racked up 9 total infractions for 60 yards.
The Trojans will have to regroup quickly as they head out to Tucson, Arizona on Saturday, Oct. 11 to face the Wildcats, who themselves are coming off a thrilling upset of Oregon on Thursday. The game kicks off at 7:30 p.m. and will be broadcast on ESPN2.

Make no mistake — Adam Sandler is a comedic icon. His career is a decorated capsule of Saturday Night Live skits, cult classics like Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison and dramatic works such as Punch-Drunk Love and Funny People. His ability to entertain is undeniable, but his repertoire as of late has been questionable. Within the past seven years, all but two of his films have been deemed “rotten” on Rotten Tomatoes, a film review aggregator website. The majority of his films, trashed by critics, have also been unpopular with the public as well, a few failing to even generate more than their production costs. That’s why when Netflix announced a deal last Thursday to premiere four Adam Sandler films exclusively to its subscribers, it struck me as an irresponsible move in terms of customer service.
This partnership with Sandler followed Netflix’s decision to release the sequel to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the first full-length feature to be launched by the streaming company. Because Orange is the New Black and House of Cards have been so successful at television awards shows, it seems natural for Netflix to venture into film as well. The original Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a wuxia classic, a genre of Chinese fiction that follows the adventures of martial artists. It was directed by Academy Award-winning director Ang Lee, so the second installment, though not backed by anyone from the first film, has a critically acclaimed foundation. Adam Sandler’s audience, on the other hand, fluctuates with every film, according to statistics.
It is an audience that, for example, will appreciate Sandler’s statement regarding his Netflix partnership: “When these fine people came to me with an offer to make four movies with them, I immediately said yes for one reason and one reason only. Netflix rhymes with Wet Chicks. Let the streaming begin!” I don’t discriminate against lowbrow comedy — I usually dissolve into breathless laughter watching Steve Carell’s Michael Scott or America’s Funniest Videos. But the fact that Sandler wastes a statement on “Wet Chicks” is unsettling and potentially a reflection of the content to be produced. As a subscriber to Netflix who has to shovel out money every month, I’d like to think that the profits Netflix make contribute to quality content.
This is because I view television channels as curators for subject matter in which people can immerse themselves. Each channel can cover a breadth of genres to cater to everyone, but the shows have to be good. Most networks are sensitive to the public’s response to what they put out there, often pulling shows with a steady viewership decline. Other networks, such as HBO and AMC are not only cognizant of the numbers, but are also aware of the need for great stories to be presented on the small screen. Netflix seemed to do that with House of Cards and Orange is the New Black, shows that are nestled among the best of the best shows of past and present, but the message “Adam Sandler films” sends to the public is the ghost of Jack and Jill. We need television channels or stream sites like Netflix to help us gain access to better television efforts in a world of reality television and The CW.
According to the Huffington Post, however, Netflix acknowledges Sandler’s films as some of the most popular on the site, stating, “People love Adam’s films on Netflix and often watch them again and again.” Though this suggests some of the reason behind Sandler’s involvement with the company, according to Radio Times, Netflix doesn’t actually release the viewership numbers of each show. That means we don’t know the data figures for the people watching House of Cards or Orange is the New Black, so the popularity of Sandler on the streamer site remains nebulous.
But the deal with Adam Sandler has been done and dusted, however sour my feelings about it may be. For those of us hoping for some enthralling theatrical experience, we better deal with it — because Adam Sandler is coming soon to a computer screen near you.

Though Muslims worldwide gathered this past weekend to celebrate Eid al-Adha, come Monday they can expect to return to the same conversations being had about the status of their faith on the world stage. From Bill Maher’s offensive statements comparing Islam to the “mafia” and Reza Aslan and Ben Affleck’s subsequent arguments against such bigoted generalizations, Islam’s portrayal in the Western media has been the subject of recent controversy.
Andrea Wijaya | Daily Trojan
 
Such conversations about Islam, however, didn’t start with Bill Maher. In fact, they began on Sept. 24 when President Barack Obama addressed the United Nations General Assembly, urging the world to band together amid new U.S. airstrikes against ISIL, or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, militant targets in Iraq and Syria. Midway through his speech, President Obama called upon Muslim communities in particular to reject ISIL’s terrorism, saying, “It is time for the world — especially Muslim communities — to explicitly, forcefully, and consistently reject the ideology of organizations like al Qaeda and ISIL.”
Though this particular appeal to Muslim communities might have fallen on deaf ears for most Americans, it prompted one simple question for American Muslims: Mr. President, where have you been? 
The current military action against ISIL doesn’t call for Muslim condemnation of the fundamentalist organization’s terrorist activity. In fact, Muslims worldwide have publicly disavowed ISIL, or ISIS as it is also known, long before the United States formed a global coalition to take action against it. From the Council on American-Islamic Relations to the Muslim Public Affairs Council, several Islamic organizations, leaders and scholars have already denounced ISIL as “a danger to Islam” and “un-Islamic and morally repugnant.” Muslims worldwide have even taken to social media to express their disapproval, most notably through the #NotInMyName hashtag, a campaign launched in London by British Muslims condemning the extremist group for attempting to speak in the name of the Ummah, or the Islamic community.
Labeling ISIL as anything but Islamic is not new. Even the president himself emphasized that ISIL is an inherently un-Islamic extremist organization, co-opting the faith of 1.6 billion people for its own goals and interests.
Yet despite this implicit understanding that ISIL does not represent the Islamic community as a whole, the president’s appeal to Muslims to condemn the organization suggests otherwise. Implicit in this request rests the notion that since ISIL masquerades as an Islamic organization, all the world’s Muslims must apologize for them, lest they be accused of supporting ISIL themselves.
Not only is this assumption damning and offensive to Muslims everywhere, but it also gives credence in ISIL’s claim of being an inherently religious organization.
President Obama himself said that no religion condones the killing of civilians. But actions speak louder than words. Though President Obama might have previously emphasized that ISIL does not represent Islam, his call for all Muslims to condemn ISIL terror — much of which is targeted against Muslims themselves — implies that they do. In the same way that ISIL has no right to represent the worldwide Islamic community, President Obama has no right to implicitly shoulder the brunt of ISIL’s actions on the Muslim community’s shoulders.
In an almost immediate response to President Obama’s remarks, the hashtag #MuslimApologies went viral on Twitter, giving Muslims a forum to express their frustrations with the assumed collective responsibility in the President’s speech. Some tweets, such as this one written by Saleem Khan (@sim_ayyk) addressed this frustration head on: “Dont [sic] see why us muslims should be pressured to condemn/apologise for every action good or bad that individuals commit. #NotInMyName.” Others took a more satirical approach, such as Jenan (@WanderD0gs), who tweeted, “I’m sorry for inventing surgery, coffee, universities, algebra, hospitals, toothbrushes, vaccinations, numbers, & the sort #MuslimApologies.”
American Muslims are no strangers to the assumptions and stereotypes that come with their faith. Many of them remember the day they had to start apologizing for the acts of a few fundamentalist extremists who hijacked the World Trade Center and their faith in the same day. But in the same way one would not expect a single religious group to apologize for the acts of a few extremists, one should not place the implicit burden of ISIL’s brutality and terrorism on an entire religious community.
There are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, and President Obama’s remarks tasked each and every one of them with condemning an organization he himself says does not and should not represent them. The Muslims of the world needn’t apologize for ISIL’s injustices done in their name — but perhaps they deserve an apology.
 
Islam is indeed a crime against humanity, and its first victims are Muslims.
I think that is why Muslims are so quick and ready to assume victimhood. On a
subconscious level, they feel victimized, but in their search for the cause of
their discomfort they incorrectly identify colonialism, crusades, Jews, racism,
and so forth as the cause.
For a Muslim to face up to the reality of Islam and to admit to oneself that
Islam is the problem means to lose one’s identity. Hence the cognitive
dissonance Muslims experience when Islam is called into question. Hence the scrambling
for excuses and explanations that can convince the Muslims themselves that
Islam is not the problem. And the explanations tend to be colonialism,
crusades, Jews, racism, and so forth.
When cultural Muslims refer to spurious arguments by Islamic apologists as a
counterargument to brush aside direct quotes from the Qur’an and the hadiths,
it is not that they are deliberately trying to to deceive the non-Muslims. They
are desperately clinging to the hope that Islam is not the problem. When they
repeat the talking points of Islamic apologists explaining how Islam is a
religion of peace, their primary aim is to convince (delude) themselves and
make the cognitive dissonance go away at least momentarily, which then removes
the immediate threat to their identity and postpones the inevitable
confrontation.
Unlike most of the Muslim world, Turkey is a country where, thanks to
militantly secularist strains, there are more Muslims who are not completely
enslaved by their Muslim identity. That gives slightly more breathing space for
the individual to break the chains of Islam. Nonetheless, it still means you
have to turn your back on large parts of your cultural heritage and family.
Families in any culture have members who seek to enforce tradition. In Muslim cultures
the conservative members of the family are enforcers of Muslim identity, which
brings along with it the whole can of worms that is the Qur’an and the hadiths.
