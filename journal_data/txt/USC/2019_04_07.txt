No. 6 USC bounced back from a loss to No. 4 Pepperdine to beat crosstown rival No. 5 UCLA in a five-set match on Saturday’s Senior Night.
Senior outside hitters Ryan Moss, Jack Wyett and Gianluca Grasso had 16, 13 and 12 kills respectively. Wyett had five digs and three blocks, while Grasso added seven digs. Senior libero Matt Douglas totalled a match-high 12 digs. The Trojans remain undefeated at home in 2019. 
The Bruins scored the first 2 points of the match and kept their lead for most of the first set, although the Trojans trailed closely behind. However, UCLA pulled ahead at the end and the Trojans couldn’t quite catch up for a 19-25 set finish. 
The momentum started in USC’s favor in the second set with the Trojans scoring the first 3 points. They maintained their lead until the Bruins caught up and tied the game 7-7. The score was tied up again at 8-8 and 9-9 until the Trojans began to pull ahead once more. USC finished the set on top, 25-15. 
UCLA dominated the third set, scoring the first 4 points before running the score up to a 12-point lead. The set finished 14-25, Bruins.
The fourth set stayed tight, with neither team gaining clear dominance. But USC managed to pull ahead enough to come out on top 25-20. 
The teams traded leads for most of the fifth set until USC took a 3-point lead at 13-10, and Wyett’s kill won the set 15-11 to secure the victory over UCLA.
“It was not a pretty win by any means,” Douglas said. “We didn’t play as [well] as we know we can. But we pulled out all the resilience we’ve accumulated throughout the year and just came together in the perfect moments.”
Junior middle blocker Daenan Gyimah led the Bruins with 21 kills and seven digs. Senior setter Micah Ma’a added 18 kills, 7 digs, three blocks and 3 aces. Sophomore middle blocker Grant Maleski served 3 aces of his own.
Douglas said that dealing with adversity has allowed the team to grow over the course of the season. Heading into playoffs next week, the Trojans’ look to stay hot.
“[We will focus on] enjoying the success we’ve had, but not being complacent,” Douglas said. “Kind of taking a little reset and just striving to be hungry because we haven’t had a playoff push in a while now, and I think we’re due for one.”
Grasso led the Trojans in their match against Pepperdine on Thursday with 12 kills while hitting .556. Wyett added 11 kills and Douglas had 8 digs.
The Waves jumped out to an early 7-2 lead and ran with it to win the first set 25-16. In the second set, USC managed to gain a 9-6 lead but couldn’t maintain it and Pepperdine pulled ahead to win the set 25-23. 
Redshirt senior outside hitter David Wieczorek had 13 kills hitting .571 to lead the Waves in their 3-0 sweep over the Trojans. Senior outside hitter Kaleb Denmark added 11 kills for Pepperdine, senior outside hitter Michael Wexter added 10 kills and 5 digs and senior middle blocker Max Chamberlain put up 4 aces.
These two matches end conference play for the Trojans as they move on to playoffs. USC secured the No. 3 seed in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament and will host No. 6 seed Grand Canyon 7 p.m. Saturday in North Gym.

The Trojans took to the turf Saturday at Cromwell Field for the annual Spring Showcase, giving the hundreds of fans in attendance and thousands more watching on TV a taste of what they can expect to see this upcoming football season.
In the past few years, it has become custom for USC not to run a true spring game anymore. Instead, it runs extended scrimmage sessions with alternating situations. While it’s a rather fruitless exercise to make projections for the season based on what happens on a Saturday in April, the showcase certainly provided moments of excitement and reasons to be optimistic in the fall.
Offense
All eyes were on offensive coordinator Graham Harrell’s air-raid offense, and it didn’t disappoint. The effects of simplifying the offense were clear, with the quarterbacks making quick and efficient decisions and the offensive line moving with certainty. 
All of the quarterbacks performed nicely on the day, with redshirt sophomore Jack Sears having the best showing of the group, making some nice connections down the field and doing well under pressure. The group only threw one interception on the day.
 The receiver group had a nice all-around outing, from veterans to newcomers alike. Senior Michael Pittman, redshirt junior Tyler Vaughns and sophomore Amon-Ra St. Brown were their usual selves, while rising sophomore Devon Williams bounced back from a rough start to the day with some nice grabs later on. 
The star of the group had to be early-enrollee freshman John Jackson III, who’s been impressive all spring and did more of the same on the field Saturday. Jackson’s sturdy frame and refined route running make him a dangerous target, and he made a number of excellent catches throughout the day — his best being a toe-dragging sideline catch 20 yards downfield on a corner route. He’ll make a strong case to earn some playing time as the offseason continues.
Though most of the running backs’ work Saturday involved catching swing passes and taking routine carries, the group provided what was easily the day’s biggest offensive highlight, courtesy of Markese Stepp. The 230-pound rising sophomore is known for being a punishing battering ram with the rock in his hands, but on an early carry to the right, he made sure everyone in attendance knew that he had speed to burn as well. 
Stepp jetted through the defense, beating every defender on the field and breaking an ankle tackle on the way to a 57-yard touchdown. Stepp has been a force all spring long. It wouldn’t be a massive surprise to see him as the Trojans’ lead back come fall.
Defense
As fun as the offense may have been at times, the undisputed star of the day was on the other side of the ball. Early-enrollee edge rusher Drake Jackson had a monstrous outing. At only 17, Jackson looks the part of a grown defensive end, pairing tremendous athleticism with his hulking frame. Head coach Clay Helton noted the same, comparing him to Trojan legend Leonard Williams.
“He reminds me a lot of Leonard … just a grown man as an 18-year-old,” Helton said.
Jackson found his way into the backfield all day, putting pressure on the quarterbacks and notching an impressive sack on a speed rush against the right tackle. 
The moment of the day came when Jackson made a near supernatural play rushing Sears off the left edge. The play was a screen pass into the flat, designed to draw him in toward the quarterback only to have the ball popped to the running back over his head. 
But Jackson had other plans. He sniffed out the play design immediately, baiting Sears into making the throw and within an instant doing the unthinkable; he stuck out his left arm, and with a single hand, plucked the ball out of the air, proceeding to run it back for a 39-yard pick-six. 
That play encapsulated all the elements of Jackson’s game that could make him so special — the freak athleticism, the awareness and the natural feel for the game that allowed him to diagnose the play. This talent has been on display all throughout the spring in flashes, but none brighter than Saturday’s performance. It would be no surprise to see him find his way onto the field early and often in the season.

On the surface, there is nothing wrong with Lynn Swann signing autographs for money in Virginia as he did last weekend. A lot of former athletes, especially accomplished ones like Swann, hold autograph sessions, connect with fans and capitalize off of their fame in the process.
But the difference here is that Swann is not just another retired athlete; he is the University of Southern California’s athletic director.
Even under the best of circumstances, a university athletic director going out of their way to make cash from autographs is a bad look, considering that none of the student-athletes who make up the entirety of the program are allowed to do the same. It is, at best, what one might call “bad optics.” 
USC, right now, is not a program — or, for that matter, a university — operating under the best of circumstances. The men’s basketball team didn’t qualify for postseason play for the first time in three seasons. The football team finished the regular season under .500, missed a bowl game and somehow took an even bigger “L” in the offseason when Kliff Kingsbury said, “thanks, but no thanks” to the offensive coordinator position. And the entire school is reeling from the fallout of the college admissions scandal in which Swann’s senior associate athletic director and legendary water polo coach were both arrested for their alleged participation. 
From bad, to worse, to worser. And Lynn Swann is all the way across the country, signing autographs. 
Swann did release a statement later in the week defending his “brief weekend trip back East,” a sign that he does care about optics — once they are already bad and beyond defensible levels. He said that during his trip, he was “constantly connected with people at our university.” He claimed that not showing up would have been a breach of contract because he had agreed to attend the event months prior — which is ironic because he prioritized the optics of not showing up to an autograph session higher than the repercussions of leaving USC for a weekend in the midst of a crisis.
According to the Los Angeles Times, Swann was invited to a retreat in Santa Barbara with University trustees and senior leaders to discuss governance issues, though he was “not required to attend” and had discussed the matter with Interim President Wanda Austin.
That’s fair and appropriate. But to put this in layman’s terms: There is a time for you to go out and have fun and there is a time that you stay home and take care of business. This was not the time to go out. Not with the issues surrounding USC and the athletic department. Not with the optics of how it would look. And not with Swann already under fire for multiple recent decisions. 
In the statement, Swann said the Times article “would have you believe that I traveled to sign autographs with no concern for what is going on at USC. Nothing could be further from the truth.”
But this is more than just signing autographs. This is about not firing head coach Clay Helton after a 5-7 season. This is about the embarrassment that was the Kingsbury episode. This is about Swann admitting to the Times that he was “blindsided” by the college admissions scheme despite the fact that Donna Heinel was third-in-command in the athletic department. 
The problems that are enveloping USC are bigger than Swann, and he is not solely responsible for everything. But as the head of the athletic department, Swann is one of the faces of this University. Considering this is USC, where the athletic director has as much — if not more — clout as the interim president, the president-elect or any other University leader, Swann’s actions reflect upon the entire school and negatively impact its reputation. 
Thus far, Swann has done more to harm USC’s reputation than improve it, which is hard to do at a school with a historic sports legacy. He has proven to be tone deaf — both in his decisions and public statements defending those decisions — and he has repeatedly declined interview requests from the Daily Trojan and other media outlets. 
Signing autographs is not a fireable offense. But when put in context with the myriad other eyebrow-raising decisions, it’s hard to argue against the notion that there is surely someone else more qualified and self-aware to lead USC’s athletic program.

For many people, the first step to exercise is finding a good playlist. Exercisers turn to Spotify in search of high-adrenaline tracks to help on them on the treadmill or at the barbells. Or, on date night, the host sets the mood by searching for “romance” playlists to play in the background while they prepare dinner. Sleep enthusiasts rave about the benefits of soundscape apps that play back terrestrial noises to lull users to sleep. 
Mood and environment-based playlisting is gaining ubiquity. Listening to music is arguably becoming more of a background activity than one that is given unadulterated attention (such as film or video games), and people want sounds that supplement their daily lives. Instead of trying to find specific albums that conjure a particular ambiance, people spend time looking for playlists that align with the environment they are in or the activity they are engaging in. 
Why do we need highly curated playlists, though? What if there was an entire platform that did this in real time, without the need for human interaction? Adaptive music — music that “adapts” to a person’s setting — is on the horizon for the music industry and will have monumental implications for the way music is created and consumed. The premise of adaptive music is fairly simple: An user indicates to the software in some way (or the AI would be smart enough to recognize) that they are engaged in some activity or have transitioned from one activity to another, and music is created in real time to fit whatever they are doing.
For example, suppose someone is taking a quick jog around their block for 30 minutes and they enter a “workout” application on their smartwatch or smartphone. AI would use this information to immediately craft a soundscape that complements the energy of their run. After the workout, the music would change instantaneously to help the runner relax. Or, from greetings and cheese board appetizers to red wine and goodbyes, the music would adapt to a party host’s needs without the host having to ever interact with the software. 
Interestingly, the technology for something like that already exists and is already in use. Warner Music Group, one of today’s three major record labels, just signed a deal with AI start-up Endel, an algorithm creates albums based on mood and environment and suggests those to users based on what they are doing. Similarly, start-up Weav Music takes existing songs and alters their BPMs based on the activity the user is engaged in. 
This has pretty far-reaching ramifications for the music and tech industries. Since major labels are beginning to sign contracts with adaptive music platforms, it is conceivable that they may own copyrights for AI neural nets in the future instead of albums and singles created by humans. That would revitalize the recorded music business and keep labels from going under and would open up myriad job opportunities for musicians. The software would definitely need human input in the early stages for things like basic music theory and mood detection; the neural net would need to understand chord progressions, cadence, melody and atmosphere. This provides ample opportunity for practicing musicians, music professors, musicologists and music engineers. 
For tech giants like Apple, Google and Amazon, this frontier presents major means for innovation. All three companies have their own music streaming services, as well as their own home speakers. Take Apple, for instance. The company’s music streaming service Apple Music is fully integrated with its home speaker, the HomePod. Imagine someone walking into their living room with their iPad, lying down on their couch, opening the Apple Books app and then saying, “Hey, Siri, play my Music IQ radio station.” The AI, in turn, would recognize that the user is in their living room, lying down on their couch with a book and create music accordingly.
AI is scary to many people, but it has a plethora of applications that can augment our everyday lives. Think about how common it is to sometimes endlessly search for music to fit particular activities or moods. Why not use an AI that creates the exact sounds you are looking for, and does it all instantly? Adaptive music is already here, and it is only a matter of time before we are all engrossed in it.

Rock band PUP’s newest album, “Morbid Stuff,” which released Friday, contains the band’s best work to date — and by a wide margin. In its first half, the album thrives off of sugary guitar riffs, punchy lyrics and the earwormy angst the band has built its reputation upon. Throughout the second half, the band puts the “punk” in “pop punk” and manages to focus its fury into a mesmerizingly mature sound fans have been anticipating for years. Separately, these halves would make two remarkable achievements in PUP’s discography. Together, however, they’re antithetical, and the jarring inconsistency stains what would otherwise be an immaculate record.
PUP has been on the rise for a while now, having occupied its own niche in both power pop and pop punk since the early 2010s. There’s a unique charm to PUP’s trainwreck persona, demonstrated by the group’s proudly emo, self-aware lyrics about refusing to grow up and dealing with press attention. 
After a tour a few years back, lead singer Stefan Babcock was informed that he wouldn’t be able to perform lead vocals on songs again, due to the strain placed on his vocal cords from screaming in previous performances. However, the band moved forward after delivering its 2016 album “The Dream Is Over,” which features clever and candid songs tailored around Babcock’s condition.
However, PUP hasn’t been able to turn all heads due to its immaturity. The members suffer from the self-pitying angst that afflicts many in their field. Following multiple releases that feature the same themes of alcoholism, depression and a lack of self-control, the band’s sound becomes monotonous. Nobody can root for a protagonist that takes themselves too seriously and sees no personal growth.
 The first half of “Morbid Stuff” seems to shave off this issue. From the beginning, the band seems to play more into its dry, dark humor, rather than striving for profound and poignant introspection. The titular first track “Morbid Stuff” proves this, opening with the lines “I was … sitting around and thinking all this morbid stuff like if anyone I’ve slept with is dead.” The candidness about such an intrusive, unwelcome and underdeveloped thought is satirical and sets the tone for a record filled with these pained, dry one-liners. 
Lead single “Free At Last” features the group’s most self-aware (and arguably catchiest) hook to date: “Just ’cause you’re sad again, it doesn’t make you special at all!” Backed by heavy snares and rowdy baselines, the song makes for a cathartic headbanger. “Scorpion Hill” is another highlight. Cutting out all instrumentation except for one guitar, the song begins reminiscent of a nostalgic campfire song and slowly builds in harmonies until the melody picks up to swing-like pace with almost ska undertones. 
 As usual, PUP heavily plays up the theme of heartbreak on “Morbid Stuff.” This is best personified on “See You at Your Funeral,” which might be one of the year’s best break-up songs. F sharp and A minor are suitable chords for the band, and the chorus carries a fun somewhat staccato rhyme scheme that allows for lots of surprise added-on lines. Every time it seems like the lead singer has made peace, he falls right back to pettiness. 
The second half is remarkable in a different way. The instrumentals get noticeably messier right around the seventh track. The vocals lose a level of mastery, making for an unkempt muffle reminiscent of garage rock or early heavy metal, and the general sonic landscape gets more cacophonous with heavy drums and ominous guitar solos, making it delightfully difficult to differentiate between what’s going on. More rock-leaning listeners will appreciate the later collection of songs on “Morbid Stuff,” particularly the aptly-named “Full Blown Meltdown.” The subject matter gets heavier, covering issues like poverty, mortality and the general state of world affairs. 
Still, by demonstrating they can go the distance on certain songs, PUP invalidates its charming humor and lack of seriousness on others. The band delivers the track “Kids,” an early, syrupy sweet song about melancholy and love, with overly flowery prose and slam poetry-style cadence. The first half of the album, where the context is tongue-in-cheek, is forgivable. However, by the end, it appears as if PUP is begging listeners to take them seriously, causing these verses to become insufferable. Judging the record as a whole instead of the sum of its parts, “Morbid Stuff” is simply confusing.

For college students across all academic fields, taking part in faculty-directed research is a great way to gain valuable experience, whether or not they plan to pursue post-graduate degrees. However, the majority of undergraduate research assistantships are unpaid. This poses a dilemma for students who need the experience but cannot afford USC if they are deprived of an hourly wage. Given that undergraduates make significant contributions in their labs at the cost of their financial wellness, it is time for faculty to start prioritizing this issue.
Underpaying undergraduate assistants is currently not a priority because of the misconception that students are only hired to perform mundane tasks. The reality, however, is that undergraduates contribute valuable work to faculty projects. Students are typically tasked with collecting data, analyzing findings and writing reports, all of which are crucial to the research process. Those who are deeply involved in research may even draft their own proposals and carry out personal projects. It is not uncommon for them to be listed as contributing authors on published papers. Because some labs are underfunded, they do not prioritize paying undergraduate research assistants. Their work should not be devalued — and for the level of effort and commitment their roles require, it’s only fair that they receive monetary compensation.
It is common for research labs to require undergraduate assistants to work 10 hours a week. As such, working a part-time job on top of serving as a research assistant is not feasible for many students who have class and other extracurricular obligations. Furthermore, medical schools and many graduate programs require that applicants have prior research experience Subsequently, students who are pursuing careers in certain fields do not have the flexibility in choosing a paid job over a research assistantship.
While USC has programs that provide funding for undergraduate students working in unpaid research, the amount that they provide is a far cry from the national standard for a living wage. One of the most popular options is Student Opportunities for Academic Research, which aims to cultivate scholarly inquiry early in students’ careers and foster connections between students and faculty. This program offers a $1,000 stipend for an entire academic year of research. If the average undergraduate research assistant works 10 hours per week for 32 school weeks, the stipend averages out to an hourly wage of $3.12 over 320 hours. This is less than a quarter of Los Angeles’ minimum wage, which increases to $14.25 this year.
The SOAR program also limits recipients to two students per faculty member, yet most research groups have more than two undergraduate students on staff. Furthermore, this stipend goes directly into the recipients’ tuition, meaning that students do not have the freedom to allocate money to other areas of financial need such as housing, groceries or transportation.
For low-income students who rely on part-time jobs to pay for college, unpaid research is simply unfeasible and greatly limits opportunities for students who are interested in medical and graduate school. While work-study is an option for some positions, not all research groups are available for work-study pay. Getting involved with a lab that operates within a student’s field of interest is crucial in developing relevant and practical skills for future employment. At the moment, research is not an even playing field for students of different socioeconomic backgrounds looking to gain these skills through research. Making research assistantships paid will open the door for students of all socioeconomic backgrounds to get involved with research, empowering them to not only further their academic interests outside the classroom, but also to act as a stepping stone into graduate-level education. 
Ultimately, this will benefit both faculty and students; faculty will be able to hire from a broader pool of talented students, and students will have better access to these positions.
Although unpaid undergraduate research assistant positions have been normalized, it is time for faculty researchers to see the value of the work that undergraduates contribute to their labs and realize that by not paying these students, they are limiting the opportunities for aspiring researchers who are unfairly disadvantaged because of their financial situations.

2028 feels like a long time from now, but given the timeline of city planning, nine years will go by in a flash. In nine years, Los Angeles will host over 300 sporting events, an estimated 10,000 athletes and 500,000 visitors. In nine years, L.A. will surrender major public and private landmarks, stadiums, buildings and spaces for these events. In nine years, L.A. streets, sidewalks and public transit systems will be far more crowded than they are now.
And in nine years, L.A. will host the Summer Olympic Games, again, and there’s a high chance that the city and its residents will suffer from negative consequences the Games bring. 
The first point of contention is that L.A.’s Olympic bid was accepted undemocratically. Groups like NOlympics are calling for a referendum, an opportunity for L.A.’s residents to make the decision since it impacts them directly, rather than handing their vote to the Olympic bid committee.
While a survey conducted by NOlympics found a general disinterest in L.A. hosting the Olympics, the survey was prone to volunteer bias — people who do not have strong feelings do not take the time to go online and record their responses. As a result, only those who were strongly against the Olympics took the time to respond, yielding skewed data among participants.
But understandably, most people would vote thinking only of the prestige and excitement the Games bring. However, there is a variety of other issues the Games would create that L.A. residents are unaware of. 
Should the Olympics cost more than the profit it generates, paying for the debt is on California residents. Called the “taxpayer guarantee,” Assembly Bill 132 allows L.A. a $270 million leeway in case the Games go overbudget. All of this money comes from California taxpayers, most of whom don’t know what they’re paying for.
When L.A. hosted the 1984 games, the city ended with a $215 million surplus, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. But it’s likely the infrastructure that was created then will be unable to support the Olympics now, and the city already has a plan to expand transit, called “28 by 28,” promising 28 completed projects by the year 2028. Promising, but unrealistic — the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority is already seeing a financial gap between their plan and execution.
Though L.A. currently has more promising infrastructure and a positive Olympic-funding track record, costs of hosting the Olympics have increased since 1984. Rio is still recovering from the immense debt it incurred from hosting the 2016 Summer Olympic Games. Brazil was $20 billion in debt post-Olympics, and the country fell into its worst recession in decades. But beyond the possible financial strain the Olympics would place on California residents, there will be other changes that affect Angelenos in unforeseen ways.
If L.A. hosts the Olympics, pressures on undocumented immigrants would increase. For the duration of the Games, many L.A. residents will worry about deportation and other measures against them.
The city’s bid committee voted to designate the 2028 Summer Olympics as a National Security Special Event, meaning federal law enforcement agencies would handle security, and it would be funded by all U.S. taxpayers. But the committee failed to recognize that the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement are included in these agencies. 
According to a 2017 report by the Pew Research Center, roughly 10% of the 11.1 million immigrants illegally residing in the U.S. live in L.A. and Orange counties. With such a high population of undocumented immigrants, having a heavy ICE presence puts many residents at risk.
Even closer to home, the Olympics could have negative effects on USC. The Daily Trojan reported that activists protested against L.A. hosting the Olympics as soon as the bid was announced in 2017, and local residents voiced fears that went unheard by the bid committee. Previous games (think Rio de Janeiro in 2016 or Atlanta in 1996) have historically displaced residents because of wasteful development projects. And even though LA 2028 says it will rely on existing venues, it doesn’t account for the possibility that hosting the Olympics in L.A. may still displace residents due to third-party developments.
There are many uncertainties revolving around hosting the Olympic Games. Rather than an international game of hot potato, the International Olympic Committee should consider a permanent, reusable host city equipped with the necessary infrastructure and resources. L.A. has hosted twice in the past, but whether it can stomach another hot potato, however, is still to be determined.

Inspired by a previous on-demand restaurant service app he designed, Leor Massachi, one of the co-founders of Dandy, wanted to find a way for dating app users to connect in real life faster than they would traditional dating apps.
“The problem [Dandy] is solving is the significant time and effort required to actually meet up, where it takes weeks on conventional dating apps to meet up,” Massachi said. “On ours, it takes days. It’s a much more enjoyable, efficient process that actually works.”
The Dandy team comprises Massachi, co-founder Daniel Newman, head of marketing Kaitlyn Rassi, two non-USC engineers and creative director Caroline Moore, a senior majoring in computer science and business administration. Both co-founders would be current seniors in the Marshall School of Business, but they left the University this year to pursue Dandy full-time. 
Rassi said the app is currently targeting local communities and is catered toward college students — but not all of them. Currently, Dandy’s pairing algorithm does not take into account those in the LGBTQ+ community;  the app assumes users are straight and doesn’t allow them to change their sexual preferences.
“Right now, we’re targeting college students because they’re the most socially charged,” Rassi said. “They live super close to one another, and they’re open to new experiences, which all align with our brand values. We have plans in the future to open it up to the public.”
Newman said the university-only approach eliminates the need for filtering options like age, distance and sexual orientation.
“We’re starting only with straight users at this time and the simple reason is [cash flow],” Newman said. “Given that we’re launching in a hyperlocal market, we won’t be able to open up Dandy to more communities until we have a much larger user base that can actually have self-sustaining live sessions for other people.”
Users can only access Dandy when they are notified that the app is going live. Each user is then randomly paired with another student who attends the same university. When the individual’s photo pops up on their screen, the user gets five seconds to like the person. 
“If you both like each other, you go onto a three-minute chat, where you get to talk back and forth and see if you have any similarities,” Newman said. “If you connect after that, you can choose to exchange numbers and go straight to iMessage to meet up in the real world.” 
According to Newman, the app was not modeled after popular dating apps like Tinder and Bumble, which offer a more passive online dating experience. He said Dandy is more engaging for students because it is only open during certain timeframes. 
“The whole idea is that instead of swiping endlessly on other dating apps for hours on end, our app only goes live for three minutes a day,” Newman said. “It’s a heart-racing experience that supplements real life. It’s not a replacement to real life like many other apps.”
Rassi said the app encourages users to go out and meet new people after introducing them for a limited amount of time when the app goes live.
“Our slogan for the launch is ‘Go Out Tonight,’ just really encouraging people to get out there, try new experiences, meet new people, get out into the real world and off your phone,” Rassi said. 
Rachel Holzer, a freshman majoring in political science and international relations, identifies as bisexual and said she would not use an app that doesn’t allow people who identify as queer to participate.
“As a bisexual woman, I would definitely never use an app that would only match me to men because I’m not only looking for men,” Holzer said. “The intentions of the app creators probably weren’t to be homophobic, but by not allowing same-sex matches to occur, it’s outright discriminatory.”

Shilpa Sadagopan first came up with the idea for Thoyen, a student services app, when she realized how much extra spending money she needed as a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Sadagopan, now a senior majoring in business administration and popular music at USC, has since taken her concept to market with help from her father.
Thoyen creates a marketplace for hiring and offering student services. Thoyen’s value proposition is “the college student’s easiest way to get tasks done and most flexible way to earn money,” according to its website.
Thoyen offers not only task requests and responses, but also a marketplace for rentals or purchases and carpool options. Potential tasks include cleaning, housework, packing, moving and vehicle washing.
“It’s not just focused on one thing, like Uber or Postmates,” Sadagopan said. “We have apartment cleaning and laundry services. Within all of those things there are all of these intricacies, like how [to] explain to people what all of these things are but still keep the app looking clean, not over-inundating people with information.”
After three years in production, the app launched on iOS in late March at USC and Texas A&M. After workshopping the idea with another student at Penn during her freshman year, Sadagopan told her family about it during one of their ongoing entrepreneurial brainstorm sessions.
“My dad has always been a really big advocate for coming up with your own ideas,” Sadagopan said. “My brother and I would go home, and we would just have these family conversations … He always says ideas are nothing without execution, so if you really want to work on this, then we can.” 
In Fall 2016, Sadagopan transferred to USC to study popular music. She quickly added a business administration major, resulting in a busy three-year schedule — she’s currently enrolled in 24 units.
Sadagopan said her busy schedule motivated her to launch the app. She didn’t qualify for work-study and didn’t have the time to work a full-time internship. Sadagopan said she hopes Thoyen offers students more flexibility in their schedules.
“I was like, ‘Maybe we can combine these and create an app that allows people to sign up as either customers who want to get these tasks done or [as task providers],’” Sadagopan said.
Sadagopan said she wanted to create a centralized place for task management. With an overwhelming amount of options, including TaskRabbit, Thumbtack, Craigslist and Facebook, she wanted to streamline the service booking and offering processes for students.  
The company plans to earn revenue by taking a percentage off each transaction, ranging from five to 10%, depending on the size and difficulty of the task.
In the spring of Sadagopan’s junior year, her father decided to come on board as Thoyen’s full-time co-founder. Years of ideation finally began to take shape as the father-daughter duo financed the app, outsourcing development to engineers in India.
“So far, it’s been going pretty good … At this point, my biggest challenge would be to actually get it going live as soon as possible,” Sadagopan said. “We only have another month before school closes, so the biggest challenge is to roll it out … and make sure everything is working.” 
Alexandra Caro Chavez, a junior majoring in business administration and economics, is a Thoyen brand ambassador. Chavez and Sadagopan strategize the brand’s identity and messaging and are looking to expand their team. 
“It’s pretty free, all the work I do,” Chavez said. “They give me a lot of freedom to do a lot of what I want. They let me put a lot of input in all [of the app’s] ideas.” 
The working title of the app started as “aaya,” which translates to a service-person. However, the team decided to pivot away from that, as the term has an unfavorable connotation in its home country of India.
Thoyen is a play on the Tamil word thoren, which means friend. The name Thoyen was adopted for Western pronunciation — it also serves as an acronym for “To Help Others & Yes Exactly Now.”
While the app is reaching the end of its development stage, the marketplace is waiting for enough user sign-ups to go live. The app is also only on iOS for now, but the team plans to launch an Android version by the end of the semester.
Sadagopan said the biggest challenge has been cultivating Thoyen’s growth and engagement.
“It’s obviously been hard because people can see it on Instagram, but going from impressions, to click-throughs, to actual acquisitions — that is hard,” Sagadopan said. “I guess I didn’t realize that just by reading these case studies in my business classes.”
