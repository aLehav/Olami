Vanessa Lopez | Daily Trojan
Led around the globe by passion and wanderlust, in 2016 alone, senior Vanessa Lopez traveled to six different countries, all while balancing six different classes and five different jobs. In the coming year, she’ll travel to eight different countries, including France, the country she is currently studying abroad in. Lopez has devoted her time here at USC to taking full advantage of all the resources and money given to her so she can travel the world.
But Lopez wasn’t always full of  wanderlust. She began her time at USC at the Viterbi School of Engineering, studying computer science and computer engineering, along with a minor in theatre. But her life quickly changed after spending a Maymester in Japan, where she took an American Studies class with a professor who was an advocate in inspiring first-generation college students to travel the world and find what they are passionate about. Lopez suddenly realized her true passion was traveling, and upon her return to USC, she immediately changed her major to law, history and culture.
“As a low-income student, I [really] could not have traveled without the help of scholarships, grants and fellowships,” Lopez said. “It allowed me to travel for a low cost, or even [for] free. I also traveled a lot though Maymester, Problems Without Passport courses and alternative Spring and Winter Break programs.”
And at the end of each USC Abroad Program, Lopez would take the opportunity to independently travel to neighboring countries. For example, when Lopez stayed in Hong Kong for 10 weeks, she also traveled to China and Thailand. Ultimately, within her four years in college, she has traveled to nearly 15 different countries, all pdaid for through various school fundings.
Her vibrant, observant nature led to pick up on the cultural norms of regions, and began evaluating the stark contrasts between their world and the one she grew up in. Lopez herself was born and raised in South Los Angeles, and was a part of the Neighborhood Academic Initiative, a USC program that encourages students within the community to go to college.
“Being Hispanic, I have seen my fair share of racism [here in America], but I have been able to see how I am privileged in many ways,” Lopez said.
While studying abroad in India, she was stunned to see the  pronounced gender divide.
“In the area I was in, you would never see women on the street and when you did, they would wear traditional Indian garments,” Lopez said. “Fully covered. Then, you would see men dressed in completely modern clothing. It was such a contrast.Socioeconomic status, racism and gender plays an enormous role in how society sees people, and their culture and customs reflect that — what they believe is right and wrong.”
But none of this would be possible if it wasn’t for Lopez’s relentless dedication to securing funding. For each trip, Lopez applied to either one fellowship, grant or scholarship.
“The main scholarship which allowed [me] to travel during the summer was the USC Global Fellowship,” Lopez said. “[And all] of the fellowships I got went directly to travel, either for internships abroad if I took courses abroad, or if I was volunteering.”
In addition, she also applied for Norman Topping, a scholarship which gives funding to USC students up to two times over the course of their four years here. Within Norman Topping is a supplemental exceptional funding, which gives additional aid to students who wish to do more.
“I used both of my fundings my first two years of my college life,” Lopez said. “I used it first for Japan trip, which covered everything from the flight, the hotel and every travel expense in Japan, and half of my meals. I applied for two exceptional funds, I applied for grants through the volunteer centers; I applied for fellowships through USC; and I applied for other scholarships like Surf and Soar, which is through Dornsife.”
USC provides countless opportunities for all students to achieve and strive for the passions, and use their talents to achieve what they wish during their time at the University. All the student has to do is put in the time and effort to seek out these opportunities.
“A lot of students either just don’t know, or they don’t apply for it,” Lopez said. “So, there is a good chance [you] can get a scholarship, grant or funding. Each scholarship, grant or funding I have applied for, I have been able to get. The worst you can get is a no.”
Mr. Davis – Does anyone proofread your work?  Maybe they should
Ms. Lopez – You’re welcome

Last Friday, USC released a letter requiring students who want to join the Greek system to have a minimum USC GPA of 2.5. Fall formal Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic recruitment for first-semester freshmen will be deferred to the spring semester.
USC has justified this decision by describing freshman year as the  “toughest year of the transition to college as students experience the most social and academic challenges” and claims that “a number of our peer institutions have implemented policies that support first-year students by allowing them time to acclimate to the University’s academic and social climate before participating in Greek-letter organizations.”
Though the first freshman semester is a challenging time for many students, deferring Greek recruitment may do little to decrease stress and address pervasive mental health challenges, while negatively impacting future new students.
The first semester of freshman year is a difficult time to transition to campus life. Students struggle to juggle independence and cope with new tasks like managing money, acclimating to college classes and maybe even doing laundry for the first time.
But ultimately, most studies, including one produced by the American College Health Association and National College Health Assessment last year, show that many mental health issues among freshmen stem from loneliness. A freshman in their first couple of weeks of school wants to find friends, feel included and be comfortable in college life. Whether freshmen find this in sports teams, clubs or the Greek system, that decision should be available and open to them from their very first semester at USC. Prohibiting new students from joining the Greek system is both an overstep of USC’s involvement in student affairs, as well as discriminatory toward the Greek system.
The deferment focuses solely on the Greek system (which makes up just 26 to 27 percent of students), but does not address other campus organizations. Student athletes spend innumerable hours practicing and playing varsity sports, and freshman athletes have to adjust to the same unfamiliarities as their freshman peers while competing on the collegiate level, and yet USC does not limit the ability for these athletes to join sports teams. Many campus clubs are larger time commitments than Greek organizations and have received no directives from USC. USC cited mental health concerns among freshmen as a factor for pushing recruitment to spring, but the University is not taking steps to combat the issue among the other 73 to 74 percent of freshmen on campus. Either the University should mandate all clubs to defer student involvement, or should rescind the decision that specifically targets Greek life.
Additionally, citing peer institutions’ decisions to defer recruitment as a reason to pass this directive is a weak bargaining point on USC’s side. This University takes pride in its individuality and its culture of academic excellence, athletic performance, student involvement and social engagement. Using other universities as a rationale is not a valid reason for deferment.
Although USC cites adjusting to academic climate as a reason to push fall rush to the spring semester, the Greek system has a higher GPA at 3.34 than the rest of the student body at 3.25. Many sororities and fraternities mandate study hours and have minimum GPA requirements. The tight-knit communities of fraternities and sororities also ensure that students can find classmates to study with, or older students to tutor them. As an incoming freshman, receiving advice about classes and having older mentors can substantially relieve academic stress.
This mandate may disproportionately affect Panhellenic sororities. The Interfraternity Council at USC has traditionally participated in both fall and spring rush, and so financially, next year, the lack of a pledge class in the fall will be less impactful. For sororities, existing members could experience increased dues to make up for the lack of a pledge class next fall. Financially, this may render Greek life more exclusive, as some members may not be able to afford increased dues.
Incoming students should have the freedom to associate with whichever club or organization they desire. Limiting options and forcing students to wait for organizations they are eager to join not only conflicts with the independent spirit of USC, but could also have myriad unintended consequences regarding mental health and student wellness.

I was planning to reserve judgement on the ongoing backlash toward football players and their protest; after all, from the grown men and women who hurled rocks at the Little Rock Nine to the cartoon artists who depicted the Obamas as apes, you can always expect America to raise its fists at black or brown people who have something to say. But the reaction to the protests of Colin Kaepernick and others underlines some of our deepest political hypocrisies. That is why I have chosen to spend time on it; not because it is unpredictable, or even really new — but because it is ridiculous.
It is important to discuss who is allowed to protest in the first place and who is not. When a forgotten and uneducated swath of white America made their criticisms heard — otherwise known as Election 2016  — pundits on the left and right called it inevitable and necessary. How could we move forward to include white America’s needs, to avoid repeats of 2016? These were people who claimed economic disenfranchisement, burdensome neglect by their government, abandonment of their rights by their institutions. Yet when black football players made largely the same claims — institutional abandonment, a lack of representation — they were told to shut up. In the minds of those who criticize Kaepernick and his protest, these white Americans are Americans; they have the fundamental right to be part of this country, and they are therefore entitled to everything that notions of the American dream stand for. Black and brown people, on the other hand, are not so much seen as members of this country but people who are only tacitly allowed to be here — overstaying guests. White Americans are allowed to take ownership of their citizenship, and force the government to make good on that deal. Black Americans do not seem to have that right.
As of late, Nazis have more of a right to the First Amendment than our own American athletes. Why? Because these athletes make boatloads of money; because they are treated like gods; because they are successful, and should be grateful for that success. Yet all three things could also be said of President Donald Trump, though he is still allowed to go on calling the nation busted, broken and dying. “Grateful” as a deterrent from protest is an interesting idea. Conservatives claim that discrimination narratives are bogus, and that black and brown Americans are afforded the same opportunities as everyone else — if only they’d work to achieve it. Fine. Assuming that to be true, why then, when black and brown people Americans are successful, conservatives tell them they should feel lucky? Why should that be at all lucky, assuming racism is a cop-out, the system is fair, and success is only earned? The message is clear: This country gave you something when you should have been given nothing. You don’t get to stay over on my couch and then criticize the paint color on the walls. The liberal belief that these athletes are entitled to their right to free speech and protest is predicated on the notion that these men are entitled to their rights at all; conservative critics don’t seem to think so.
But in a larger sense, it is not about the protest — it’s about the manner. It’s about the fact that it’s the anthem, and it’s the flag. The conservative disposition is such that nothing can come before patriotism; like a mother too loving to effectively discipline her children, those who place blind, rabid patriotism before the continual and critical improvement of the nation are handicapping its future, and serving as a barrier between it and the potential it can achieve. The Founding Fathers were more concerned with the tangible problems they faced than their mortal loyalty to the mythic institution of the Crown. They did not dream of building a nation of sycophants.
“Patriotism” is a cop-out; the “nation,” “America,” is not a breathing autonomous animal, but a conglomerate of all of us. “America” is the amalgamation of our laws, institutions and character. If “America” is oppressive, it is because the people who comprise it, in government and otherwise, are oppressive; so to hide behind love for “America” and use this as justification for oppression is tautological, backwards. America is what we make of it — she does not have an independent conscience or culture of her own that we must, out of blind love, defend; America is only us — and by saying you love “America” too much to cure it of its evil, you are only saying you love your racism too much to stop it from trampling your fellow man.
For the conservatives who harp on the liberal echo chamber and cry about an America that will not hear them, it is interesting how remarkably vicious they become at the notion of a few men taking a knee. “Respectful discourse” is a two-way street; negative responses to these protests are nothing but racism and nationalism dressed up as some proud patriotic song-and-dance. This country does not have time for these ridiculous hypocrisies. Next time you see a football player take a knee, take your own advice and be grateful — that is, grateful for your right to do the same.
Lily Vaughan is a junior majoring in history and political science. Her column,“Playing Politics,” runs Fridays.
Lily,
You want some hypocrisy?  Well, then, let’s go.
Ben Shaprio’s lecture at DePaul was cancelled because Leftists could not stomach hearing a different perspective.
Ayaan Ali Hirsi’s commencement gig at Brandeis was cancelled because Leftists said she was a deplorable.
The Bern was kicked off the stage in Spokane because BLM members found him offensive.  Does this sound like an enlightened, free- speech loving group to you?
Charles Murray was physically accosted and forced off stage at his planned lecture at Middlebury.
Israeli ambassadors and military speakers are threatened, shouted down and silenced by people who share your definition of free speech.
Milo’s lecture at Berkeley resulted in rioting, vandalism and violence.
Meanwhile the Bern spoke at Liberty University during his campaign and was not interrupted once.  Liberty being a Christian evangelical university.
Ahmadinejad spoke at Columbia without interruption.
Any number of extreme Muslims – Muslims who call for the genocide of Israel speak freely across college campuses.
People who spent decades in prison for felonies committed in the 60s are common lecturers at universities and their talks are never prevented by idiots who thing they understand the meaning of free speech.
Tell me, Lily, who is the hypocrite?
Ben Shapiro is a racist. F|_|ck his perspective. Did you see the Indigenous Peoples’ Day tweet?
At the outset you said, “you can always expect America to raise its fists at black or brown people who have something to say.” You lost me at that juncture.  It was them that I knew without doubt that the writer was a hyperbolic ignoramus.
You proved her point rather well.
Actually, no.  I suspect that your lean reply was probably plagiarized.
Why should I cooperate with my fellow citizens instead of pursuing my own interests? What would drive me to not only do that but to say that it is the right thing to do, even at a cost to me and mine? I would put some sort of ideology high on the list of possibilities. One possible ideology that might motivate me to worry about my fellow citizen is nationalism. Something along the lines of, “we’re all Americans, we have a responsibility to each other”.
So if you can’t share with me one of the few American traditions that unify us exactly where does that leave us? Less united than before. Less interested in pursuing common goals. More interested in tribalism.
You might want to consider that there are benefits to nationalism. And if you disagree that the benefits outweigh the harm, you might then want to make sure that everyone has another reason to care about their fellow before you start the process to undue nationalism.
In the meantime, many find taking a knee to be disrespectful and divisive.
“You can always expect America to raise its fists at black or brown people who have something to say.” But speak for yourself, Lily Vaughan, not for America! But how dare you condemn all of America as bigots? You have invalidated the wisdom of your entire article with this generalized, nauseating slur.
Don,
I find comfort in knowing that Lily is not an elitist casting judgement on Americans who do not share her warped values. I’m sure if you were to ask her she’d insist she was NOT.  AN. ELITIST.   Uh huh.
No wonder Trump won.  When it’s him or the Lilys of the world who else would a sane person vote for.
What is profoundly scary is that kids can no longer pass through our education system without being spit out the other side like a Liliy.  What has become normal at universities is dangerous to America’s future.  But what is of comfort is seeing organizations like YAF soaring in popularity among this age group.  Makes me think the Lilys of the world days are numbered and they will soon be melting like the snowflakes they are.

USC Thornton School of Music’s Music@RushHour offers a weekly, late afternoon reprieve from the madness of 5 p.m. traffic through a concert series held on Wednesday evenings in Simon Ramo Recital Hall. This week’s program featured a celebration of gay composers by the Amicus Duo, a group comprising pianist Alin Melik-Adamyan and cellist Coleman Itzkoff.
A Los Angeles native, Melik-Adamyan began taking piano lessons at age 4 and attended USC for both her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in piano performance. She is now in her final year of study for a doctor of musical arts degree in keyboard collaborative arts. Itzkoff is currently pursuing a graduate certificate in music performance and cites his family’s musical lineage as the catalyst for his 20 years of cello study.
Feeling an immediate connection as collaborators and sharing a passion for chamber music, the pair formed Amicus Duo in 2014 as a result of a last-minute call to perform together. Since its inception, Amicus Duo has made appearances in showcases, master classes, recording studios and concert halls across the United States and earned prizes in international competitions.
For Melik-Adamyan and Itzkoff, Music@RushHour has provided an opportunity to perform in front of friends and colleagues as well as to showcase their own creativity and passions through programming liberties. Wednesday’s repertoire was conceived a month ago and sparked by the duo’s mutual interest in showcasing the music of gay composers who were stigmatized and dismissed by society during their lifetimes.
The evening began with English composer Ethel Smyth’s Sonata for Cello and Piano in A minor, Op. 5. Throughout the piece’s three increasingly energetic movements, Melik-Adamyan and Itzkoff bore the emotion of the music in their body movements and facial expressions.
“Smyth was particularly underrepresented as both a gay composer and a female composer,” Itzkoff said. “In addition to being an accomplished composer, she was a suffragette who famously broke the windows of politicians who voted against women’s right to vote and spent two months in jail for her actions. Yet still to this day, she is tragically unknown in the music world, making her Sonata even more of a hidden gem.”
The program continued with Pezzo Capriccioso, Op. 62 by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, a dramatic piece that reflects the conflict between Tchaikovsky’s homosexuality and the hostility of Russian society in his time.
“The works of Tchaikovsky are frequently performed, but he is rarely ever acknowledged or even presented as a gay composer,” Melik-Adamyan said. “In performing these works this week, I want to say it loud and clear that these composers are gay and are amongst some of the most influential people who have ever lived.”
Melik-Adamyan then took the stage for a solo rendition of the fourth movement of Gargoyles, Op. 29 by Lowell Liebermann. Playing with passion and concentrated veracity, she powerfully captured the angst and frustration Liebermann imbued in the piece.
In closing, the Amicus Duo reunited on stage for the entirety of Benjamin Britten’s five-movement Sonata for Piano and Cello in C Major, Op. 65. The first two movements saw Melik-Adamyan and Itzkoff’s respective instruments engaged in a call and response musical dialogue while movement three called for slower melodies. With a sharp inhale signaling the downbeat, Itzkoff launched into the opening cello sequence of the livelier final movements as Melik-Adamyan followed suit with mounting enthusiasm on the piano. The pair finished the piece, and the concert, with a resonating flourish to ardent applause.
“These are four of the greatest musicians in history,” Itzkoff said of Smyth, Tchaikovsky, Liebermann and Britten. “Their lives and works of art are remembered and celebrated to this day, while the lives of their oppressors have long been forgotten. Then as now, those who fight on the side of justice, of love, of art and equality for all will find themselves on the right side of history.”
The Amicus Duo will perform the same program on Sunday at “Stop the Hate,” a pride event hosted by the Uptown Gay & Lesbian Alliance, continuing its mission of spotlighting and honoring all that underrepresented gay composers stand for.
As Melik-Adamyan put it, “For the love of music, let’s stop the hate!”

The crowd took in a collective breath as the first notes of “Those Quiet Evenings” by Albert Behar rang out. Characterized by rich melody paired with impassioned vocals, Thornton Edge’s first concert of the year, which took place on Wednesday, struck a chord with its audience. Listeners lowered their heads with the somber, late-night meditation, heard the sprightly chirps of birds taking flight and laughed along with the quirky self-reflection piece about anger in this performance that celebrated love, loss and the extraordinary.
Described as “a snapshot of the third millennium” by director Donald Crockett, Thornton Edge was founded in 1976 by Robert Wojciak. Since 1984, the ensemble has been led by Crockett, professor and chair of composition and assistant dean of faculty at the Thornton School of Music. Under his leadership, the group, formerly known as the Contemporary Music Ensemble, specializes in new, classical concert music. Its primary focus is on compositions within the past 20 years and world premieres featuring student works.
They have been a part of Los Angeles Philharmonic’s Green Umbrella and New Music LA, an innovative series that focuses on contemporary music. In addition to numerous projects, their extensive repertoire includes concerts at the Paris and Lyon Conservatories, the Berlin 250 Jahre Festival, the 2014 Carlsbad Music Festival and soloists with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. They were also awarded the Outstanding Ensemble Award by LA Weekly in 2004. Additionally, the group has been conducted and coached by many esteemed leaders in the realm of music and occasionally brings in both faculty and guest performers.
Crockett said all Thornton Edge alumni are professional musicians and industry leaders in Los Angeles, the United States and abroad. Their broad collection of works showcases their talents as instrumentalists and alludes to the process of present-day music performance with the quirks, stylization and refinement that goes into perfecting the craft.
“The repertoire is very colorful and exciting, including Thornton student and faculty works, and the performers are excellent,” Crockett said. “I am honored to have this opportunity to work with these wonderful students over the years. I am very proud of all of them.”
The ensemble performs four concerts throughout the academic year at Newman Recital Hall. Their first performance featured compositions from renowned composers, most notably Thornton Masters of Composition student Tamzin Elliott’s songs “Carpet of Flowers” and “For the First Time Today.” Tamzin’s two works contained traces of indie pop, eclectic sounds and traditional classical music set to introspective lyrics that created an experience that resonated with contemporary listeners. The instruments seemed to paint a picture that gave the audience a rich understanding of the music in a way that probed the depths of human existence with works such as “Death Speaks” by David Lang and “Only the Words Themselves Mean What They Say” by Kate Soper. At the conclusion of the last song, the performers were met with heavy applause and shouts of “Bravo!” could be heard throughout the room. With haunting lyrics, dynamic harmonies and expressive movements, the power of music and spirited joy rocked the audience — a tribute to the turbulence of life’s ups and downs.

I am one of very few people on this planet who genuinely cares about her Spotify profile. I have been known to make a playlist private when it’s embarassing, spend hours on the Discover pages and follow a trail of artists until I’m so far in that the songs have less than 100 plays. I have been shamed many times for being the only person who cares about how her music taste comes across — and I half-jokingly say that it’s by far my most important “social media.”
Spotify was undoubtedly the catalyst in my music exploration. Once in awhile, I like to scroll through my old playlists and see the evolution of my music taste over the years. What always struck me was the healing power that artists hold — how Bon Iver can have the same impact that Fall Out Boy has on a different person. I can almost always remember an emotion associated with a song or a playlist, and I feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude to the artists who accompanied me through any given period of my life.
While my playlists were the soundtrack to the most formative years of my life in good times and bad, the concerts were some of the highlights. There are few experiences that I hold closer to my heart than seeing my favorite bands live. The excitement has never once wavered, not even in my memories.
When I heard about the Paris attacks at the Eagles of Death Metal concert nearly two years ago, I remember feeling absolutely heartbroken. The loss of lives was jarring, and I was horrified that one of my most treasured activities was being taken over by terror. The place that had come to be a carefree sanctuary was now plagued with pain and suffering. The problems that people had come precisely to escape had now embedded themselves in the experience. The same feelings resurfaced this weekend after hearing about the Vegas shootings. When I told my parents my plans to go to a concert this week, their immediate reaction was apprehension and fear that something could happen.
While concerts may seem practical targets for terror attacks, there are underlying themes of concerts that these cruel attackers attempt to undermine. The unity of standing shoulder to shoulder with someone who has an entirely different association with the songs being performed, but is still able to sing and dance to the same words. The gratitude that is shared between the performers and the audience. Empathy is
the entire principle behind music — the ability to understand the artist’s’ emotions and resonate deeply with their message. Concerts are representative of values that we as a society strive to emulate. This, though, feels far too important to give up in fear that something might happen. But more importantly, it feels far too important to just simply hope that nothing will happen.
Complacency is incredibly dangerous. Establishing this as the status quo allows limitless pain and suffering to become the norm. Harnessing the empathy, outrage and pain that millions around the world are feeling is the only way to ensure that the future will be different.
Music is dynamic, unifying and healing — the thing that is being corrupted is what we need most. I can only hope that future teenagers have the same opportunities for self-actualization and identity development that I found in music over the years.
Some of my strongest relationships have been built around music, a shared love for concerts and the ability to establish an immediate connection with the ones around me through this is something that I can no longer take for granted. And who knows, maybe in 10 years, I’ll be looking at a playlist that I made tonight, remembering exactly what I felt at this moment in my sophomore year — while living in a society that learned from the mistakes of our past.

Love, betrayal and deceit are key ingredients for a dramatic piece of art. Each of these vices is present in Shakespeare’s play Twelfth Night. Now, the show is coming to USC, brought to life by theatre students pursuring bachelors of fine arts at the School of Dramatic Arts.
Twelfth Night stars junior Caroline Haskins as Viola, a young woman who finds herself shipwrecked on the island of Illyria. After being separated from her twin brother Sebastian, Viola disguises herself as a man, using the alias “Cesario.” She meets Duke Orsino, who employs her, telling Viola of his love for a woman named Olivia. However, Olivia, falls for Viola, thinking she’s a man.
Olivia, played by junior Li Stebner, smitten with Viola, has her own subplot that is equally as chaotic and messy as the main narrative.
“[My character] falls in love with Cisario, who is a girl,” Stebner said. “I fall in love with [her] by accident. Meanwhile, there are crazy things going on with Malvolio.”
Malvolio, played by juniot Milo Rechler works for Olivia. According to Rechler, he “work[s] for her and is in love with her.” Malvolio and Viola see tension as a result of Olivia’s love for her. With unrequited love at every turn, the chaos and lies spark a comedic tension mastered only by Shakespearean theater.
The themes of obsession and love permeate throughout the show. Haskins describes the show as being about “obsession versus true love, and the masks that we encounter.” The play shows many people pretending to be someone they’re not or performing to please others. The drama is evidently a consequence of lying and desperation for love.
Although Twelfth Night is centuries old, its themes are universal and continue to resonate with audiences of all backgrounds.
“It relates to the modern world today because still people wear masks or try to be someone they’re not,” Haskins said. “True love forms when you’re your truest self and not trying to be something you’re not.”
Junior Ian Riley, who plays Orsino, agreed with Haskins’ sentiments.
The show seeks to expose how true love is achieved through comedy and an over-the-top narrative.
The message of the show promotes self-acceptance as a catalyst for true love. The cast and crew have worked throughout the semester to honor the play and bring a new, fresh energy to the story.
Twelfth Night opens this Thursday at 7:30 p.m. at Bing Theatre. Tickets are available for purchase at the USC Ticket Office at a discounted student price of $8.

This Sunday saw two mass shootings — one in the early hours of the morning near the University of Kansas that resulted in three deaths, and another in the evening on the Las Vegas Strip that resulted in 58. The shooting in Las Vegas was the largest in modern U.S. history. 
It’s important to note that I say “modern history,” because, as the National Association of Black Journalists pointed out in 2016 following the Orlando massacre that killed 49, more than 100 African Americans were shot dead in mass shootings in 1917 and 1873. 
By no means am I trying to mitigate the severity of Sunday’s shooting and the need for serious policy change to prevent such tragedies from happening again. But I’m certain we can balance this sense of urgency with recognition of the disproportionate historic and modern consequences of gun violence on people of color, women, children, the differently abled and the LGBTQ community. 
In the wake of the 2016 presidential election, the fight to protect human rights and, in particular, the right of marginalized groups to pursue life, liberty and happiness is often scornfully tagged as “identity politics” — soft issues that are unimportant in the grand scheme of things. In particular, embittered portrayals of the fight for gun control as “political opportunism” from Democrats in the wake of national tragedies underscore this problem with our dialogue — a problem that ignores the lived consequences Americans face when their lawmakers politicize basic human decency. 
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin, House Speaker Paul Ryan and a number of other key Republicans scorned the idea of “politicizing” a tragedy by deigning to discuss policies that could prevent future mass gun-related fatalities, or claimed it wasn’t the “right time.” Of course, it wasn’t the right time for 58 to be shot dead,  nor will it ever be the “right time” for shootings that could easily have been prevented. Former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly went so far as to shrug off the deaths of these 58 Americans as the “price of freedom” in our great, great America. 
When Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire on thousands of people at a country music festival outside the Mandalay Bay resort, Paddock did not discriminate. Every day, 315 Americans are shot in murders, suicides, unintentional shootings and police interventions, and on average, every year, the United States observes roughly 12,000 gun homicides. The availability of semi-automatic rifles, the looseness of gun show sales and the lax policies favoring domestic abusers and individuals with criminal histories obtaining firearms put us all in greater danger, regardless of any facet of our identity. 
But that being said, everyday cases of domestic abuse and violence against women, last year’s Orlando shooting at a gay night club, the staggering homicide rates faced by trans people and systemic violence by law enforcement toward people of color, all demonstrate how our nation’s stalemate on gun control is an attack on some of America’s most marginalized groups. 
We’ve all heard the oft-repeated pro-gun counterargument to this: Just arm everyone to equalize the playing field. An oft-shared commercial from the National Rifle Association — the pro-gun lobbying superpower that the vast majority of Republican lawmakers rely on for funding — portrays women empowering themselves against domestic abusers by obtaining guns. 
But contrary to the “good guy with a gun” — or, in this case, “good girl with a gun” — theory, strong evidence exists to show that firearms are inherently offensive mechanisms, meant to neither defend nor equalize. States with more guns and more relaxed gun laws have higher rates of gun-related deaths than states with fewer guns and more stringent laws. And in countries like Australia, whose lawmakers responded to mass shootings with new restrictions and programs to take away firearms from people with violent histories, rates of gun-related deaths have since plummeted, according to a 2010 study. 
The focus of this column is feminism, and gun control is in many ways a feminist issue. However, it’s also a common sense issue.
The Second Amendment — which was written at a time when the existence of today’s mass killing machines was unfathomable, when America was nowhere near the militaristic superpower that it is today, and civilians had to form their own militias to survive — is fundamentally incompatible with today’s technologically advanced, diverse society. And even when our Founding Fathers wrote the Bill of Rights in the 18th century, they recognized the need to include the words “well regulated” in the amendment.
At the end of the day, gun control is also an issue inextricably bound to our nation’s capacity to feel compassion. Today, anti-abortion groups line their campaign ads with the faces of babies and children, all while their self-identified “pro-life” vessels in Congress last week let the Children’s Health Insurance Program expire, and in 2012 declined to take action and enact common sense gun control laws following a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, Conn. 
In particular, the statistics on domestic abuse, police brutality and violence against LGBTQ Americans involving guns are jarring and should remind all feminists that gun control is our issue, as much as reproductive rights and wage inequity are. Nevertheless, at the end of the day, it really is as simple as this: People who don’t care about your well-being don’t deserve the privilege of representing you. 
Contrary to what rhetoric from Republican lawmakers might lead you to believe, mass shootings may be as tragic as natural disasters, but there is a clear distinction between these phenomena — mass shootings and gun violence are largely preventable. And even though these lawmakers may never take action, you can — by showing up to the polls on Election Day and voting them out of office.

Like 9/11, the Las Vegas shooting will prove to be a Deep State false flag to further some agenda or policy move. As always, cui bono? will reveal the truth. You mention “consequences of gun violence on people of color”, who do you think is pulling the trigger in most of those cases? You mention “police brutality”, but argue that only police should have guns?
The Australia statistic is bogus.  Gun violence was decreasing before their gun control policies were implemented. The rate of decrease did not change after the laws were enacted.

In a Sept. 8 memo to students, Provost Michael Quick shared a memo  stating that the University will not tolerate sexual misconduct in any form and that you take seriously your responsibility to handle sexual misconduct on campus. We thank Provost Quick and senior administrators for their commitment, and we call on them to act on this promise with integrity, compassion and fairness.
On Sept. 22, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos revoked federal Title IX guidelines for schools investigating campus sexual misconduct. Now schools can choose to use a “clear and convincing” evidentiary standard instead of the “preponderance of the evidence” standard, an already high standard which requires parties to provide enough evidence to show their claims are more likely than not to be true. The “clear and convincing” standard would make it even more difficult for reporting students, for whom evidence is rare beyond testimony.
Additionally, guidance on promptness has been removed, giving no deadline for an investigation to conclude and allowing delay through defense tactics. And now, schools can limit appeal rights to only those accused of a Title IX violation, instead of both the reporting and accused students having equal rights.
Over the past five years, the epidemic of sexual violence at colleges across the country has come to light due to the activism of student sexual assault survivors and allies. Students at USC organized with activists across the country to file Title IX and Clery Act complaints.  Hundreds of federal complaints were filed by students across the country, including at USC.
Federal complaints filed against USC in 2013 and 2016 remain open, and the USC administration has made welcome changes. USC has hired a Title IX Coordinator, clarified policy, created task forces with students, improved the quality of support with Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services, strengthened its web presence with resources for reporting and responding students and implemented the peer program VOICE: Violence Outreach Intervention and Community Empowerment. VOICE is exactly the type of program with the potential to create widespread cultural change on campus.
We are gladdened by these changes and ask USC not to reverse or slow its course at the cost of current students. DeVos paints an inaccurate picture of the 2011  “Dear Colleague” letter, stating that the guidelines weaponize the Office for Civil Rights and victimize survivors, accused students and school administrators alike. She has called school adjudications “kangaroo courts” that force administrators to act as judge and jury. But schools do not have the power to incarcerate, only the power to expel assailants who violate school policy. All schools have a responsibility to enforce policies that do not tolerate sexual violence. Schools must have the ability to investigate and the power to expel assailants.
DeVos claims that schools now rashly expel accused students without due process, fearing bad press. But such behavior would be noncompliant with Title IX. The law gives both parties equal opportunity to provide witnesses and evidence, which are then looked at under the preponderance of the evidence standard to determine which version of events is more likely than not to be true. 
Even under the Obama-era guidelines the Title IX process weighed in favor of the accused, as sexual assault claims are difficult to prove even under a preponderance of evidence standard. DeVos should work to strengthen schools’ abilities to act fairly and respond appropriately, not strip them of their power and accountability.
Without a government willing to stand up for victims, we need our community and schools to invest even more work into the fight against sexual violence. We hear you, Provost Quick: We agree that we must to come together with a renewed commitment against sexual violence.   
Ainsley Carry, you stated in the Daily Trojan last spring that you “want to get back to the days when students were banging down my door saying, ‘Let’s do something to end sexual misconduct on our campus.’” We agree: We must all do all that we can to make the cultural change we need. 
We are asking USC to uphold the current school policies, and continue your stated commitments to investigate fairly and remove students who have violated policy, follow the “preponderance of the evidence” standard, commit to prompt investigations in a 60-day timeframe, train and staff the Title IX office to accomplish these goals and provide rape kits on campus. We also demand that USC implement the work of its task forces; collaborate with students to create effective education for cultural change; increase funding for and awareness of RSVP; conduct surveys to understand the campus cultural climate and the experience of marginalized students; and act based on survey results.
We commend the progress USC has made and we urge the University to continue moving forward. Please honor its commitment to student safety and gender equity on campus.

The “clear and convincing” standard would make it even more difficult for reporting students, for whom evidence is rare beyond testimony.
I guess rape kits don’t matter after all, then? Or texts, emails and other communications before and after the fact?
Criminal courts, of course, use beyond a reasonable doubt. And many people still get convicted of rape. (Including some who shouldn’t have been.)
Additionally, guidance on promptness has been removed, giving no deadline for an investigation to conclude and allowing delay through defense tactics.
Putting aside that depending on the case, delays can benefit the complainant as opposed to the respondent, the guidance doesn’t say that anything goes. It just means that the inflexible 60-day rule has been removed. The Office of Civil Rights can still hold schools accountable if, looking at the facts and circumstances of any given case, they took too long.
And now, schools can limit appeal rights to only those accused of a Title IX violation, instead of both the reporting and accused students having equal rights.
Yes, that’s called the right against double jeopardy. You may recognize it from the Constitution.
She has called school adjudications “kangaroo courts” that force administrators to act as judge and jury. But schools do not have the power to incarcerate, only the power to expel assailants who violate school policy.
You’re right, there is a difference — which is why schools still can’t use beyond a reasonable doubt as the standard, and can still use preponderance of the evidence if they so choose.
On the other hand, expulsion is not a trivial thing. The expelled student and/or his/her family has paid/indebted themselves maybe tens of thousands of dollars…now for nothing if there’s no degree at the end. (Fun fact: Government guaranteed student loans generally can’t even be discharged in bankruptcy.)
And if the expulsion is for something like sexual assault…good luck ever getting into school anywhere else. Or getting a job higher up the food chain than, say, telemarketer or burger flipper.
All schools have a responsibility to enforce policies that do not tolerate sexual violence. Schools must have the ability to investigate and the power to expel assailants.
Which they still do.
Thing is, responsibility goes two ways. If you have power, you also have a responsibility to keep checks and balances on that power. Due process is one kind of check and balance.
DeVos claims that schools now rashly expel accused students without due process, fearing bad press. But such behavior would be noncompliant with Title IX.
So in other words, boosting due process protections is right in the spirit of Title IX right?
The law gives both parties equal opportunity to provide witnesses and evidence, which are then looked at under the preponderance of the evidence standard to determine which version of events is more likely than not to be true.
Preponderance of the evidence may or may not be enough to protect a respondent’s rights. Especially when those rights don’t include things like cross-examination — as you rightly pointed out, testimony is one of the most important kinds of evidence here, and therefore testing credibility is all-important.

Strolling through downtown Los Angeles, there is an abundance of casual walk-in eateries that fit the fast-paced lifestyle of those living in the area. The 100-percent vegan Bodhi Bowl just may have found the trick to distinguis itself from the myriad small shops under a sea of skyscrapers. 
Situated near the corner of West 9th and Hope streets, Bodhi Bowl is in the heart of Downtown on the street level below one of the many posh apartment complexes scattered throughout the area. Although it occupies a very small space, Bodhi Bowl boasts brightly colored outdoor tables and a vibrant green interior that make the shop difficult to miss. These lively colors, paired with the open-door entrance, give the eatery an inviting and approachable feel that surrounding shops lack. Upon entering Bodhi Bowl, visitors are immediately met with earthy wood fixtures and neutral tones that speak to the shop’s environmental consciousness. 
Staff members sporting warm smiles immediately attend to guests, inquiring whether they are first-timers or if they have any questions regarding the various plant-based items aligned behind the counter. The employees encourage guests who are unfamiliar with the various vegan proteins offered at Bodhi Bowl, such as “BBQ seitan” or “tempeh bacon,” to sample them. 
Looking at the breadth of the menu suspended on the wall, Bodhi Bowl seems to rebrand the traditional restrictive stereotype veganism has held in the past. Whether a customer is in the mood for one of its assorted traditional bowls or a breakfast panini wrap, the menu has something to satisfy even the most consistent carnivore. The build-your-own bowl option is also available, boasting a choice of an impressive 40 toppings as well as a plethora of sauces and proteins. The grain bowl and the yogurt bowl give energy to the early morning riser while their banana-based smoothies provide on-the-go refreshment.

For new vegans, employees suggest starting off with one of the 10 signature bowls, specifically The Giving Bowl. Unlike the other signature bowls or build-your-own bowl option, 10 percent of the sales from The Giving Bowl go to an animal charity of the customer’s choice. The Southwestern-inspired crowd favorite is served made-to-order in a biodegradable bowl and filled with simple, fresh ingredients. Fresh Romaine lettuce atop the warm brown rice provides a solid base for the rest of the bowl to be built on. Crisp red onions beautifully complement the smoothness of a perfectly ripe avocado. Tortilla crisps add a satisfying textured crunch next to the softness of the warm black beans. Chipotle dressing finishes the bowl off enough to balance, rather than overpower, the rest of the flavors in The Giving Bowl.
With prices ranging from $5.95 to $8.95, Bodhi Bowl provides quality food at affordable prices. The signature bowls and breakfast items are capped at $8.95, and give the customer plenty of food without overcharging. These components make the establishment college student-friendly, while keeping in mind the community within Downtown.
Cannot wait to try this! Grateful someone from office left their menus at our lunch room.

I’m not here to trick nobody, it is what it is.”  
Immediately before the release of his debut studio album, Luv Is Rage 2, Lil Uzi Vert sat down with Zane Lowe on Beats 1 Radio to reflect on making money, crushing on Marilyn Manson and the messy, beautiful journey of how an average kid from Philadelphia became one of the world’s newest rap stars.  
My appreciation for Lil Uzi Vert has also been a journey.  When I first listened to the song “WDYW,” a single released in 2015 by Carnage featuring A$AP Ferg, Rich the Kid and Lil Uzi Vert, I respected Uzi’s quick delivery and various tones, but to me, his sound was incredibly mediocre.  It wasn’t until he gained momentum with the release of “Money Longer” and “Baby Are You Home” from his 2016 mixtape Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World that I finally woke up and realized that this scrawny boy from the Quaker State would go on to solidify his presence in the Atlanta hip-hop scene and influence the rest of the nation within months.  His melodies were simple.  His beats were hypnotic.  His lyrics felt genuine, free from misogynistic or homophobic punchlines and unlike the many exaggerations in storytelling within the gimmicky rap world.

My newfound adoration for Uzi increased tenfold this past April during his performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, where his charming and exhilarating stage presence inspired thousands of sweaty youth to fervently recite every word to every song.  I was in awe of the remarkable effect Lil Uzi Vert had on young people.  The TM88-produced track and undoubtedly Uzi’s most popular song,“XO TOUR LIife3,” has evolved into somewhat of a “depression anthem” for our generation.  Written about his ex-girlfriend Brittany Byrd, Lil Uzi Vert perfectly captures what it feels like to be hurt, alone and disappointed with personal flaws.  It would be inaccurate to say that the song is about depression or suicide — it seems as though some fans have analyzed the lyrics in search for more depth or a darker meaning.  I interpret the lyrics to be about close relationships, escapism and the changes that naturally occur as you leave adolescence and enter adulthood in your early 20s. Uzi, only 23 years old himself, has stated that the lyrics “Push me to the edge / All my friends are dead” refer to feeling lost amid fame and fortune. 
In his interview with Lowe, Uzi confirmed that Luv is Rage 2 is indeed a breakup album.  With 16 total tracks and cover art designed by Virgil Abloh, Luv is Rage 2 is about loneliness and frustration, but more importantly, how it is still possible to be happy under any circumstances.  Ultimately, breakups suck, but wallowing in them sucks even more. Both the instrumentals and the vocals on this album are effortless, much like the way Uzi carries himself.  The tracks “For Real,” “X” and “Dark Queen” provide fans with Uzi’s signature fast-paced delivery and harmonic melodies.  Uzi keeps the lyrics simple, and speaks frankly on life, love and substance abuse.  Admittedly, Lil Uzi Vert’s music is not for everyone, but his persona is.  His frankness and simplistic outlook on life are inspirational, encouraging everyone to embrace their emotions wholeheartedly.  Lil Uzi Vert inspires listeners to do what makes them happy, because ultimately, we are all on this journey by ourselves.

Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
Senior offensive guard Viane Talamaivao will require surgery for a torn pectoral muscle and will miss the remainder of the season, according to head coach Clay Helton. Talamaivao, who suffered his injury last week against Washington State, was a key part of an already depleted offensive line, and has most likely played his final game as a Trojan.
USC football also gathered on Wednesday for the team’s second practice since its first loss of the season to Washington State last week. The Trojans had an intense session as they prepare for Oregon State at home this Saturday.
More Injuries
Helton said that junior tackle Chuma Edoga, who hasn’t practiced this week, is “out for now” with a high ankle sprain.
“All of a sudden, we have a little bit of adversity,” Helton said. “And you can either sit back or you can get your jaw set and go be the answer.”
On a brighter note, Helton said that redshirt junior left tackle Toa Lobendahn and redshirt senior wide receiver Steven Mitchell are “progressing in the right direction” to play against Oregon State this Saturday.
A Strange Game
In a bizarre development from last week’s game, redshirt freshman defensive lineman Liam Jimmons is being investigated by Washington State University Police for allegedly leveling one of the Washington State fans who rushed the field after the game.
Junior linebacker and team captain Cameron Smith said it can be more unnerving than expected for players when opposing fans rush the field.
“People don’t realize it can be kind of scary: You don’t know what those guys are doing, a lot of them are probably intoxicated after a big win,” Smith said. “Having 10,000 people running at you is kind of freaky.” 
Emotional Practice
Coming off the team’s first loss in its last 13 games since last season, perhaps it was not surprising to see the Trojans having a fiery practice. Even during warm-ups, coaches yelled “Start fast!” at stretching players — a message that the team can’t continue to play close games into the fourth quarter.
At the end of practice, the 11-on-11 drills gave players a chance to unleash their pent-up emotions. Whether it was the defense or offense making a play, the Trojans screamed support for their teammates. The drill ended with a touchdown, followed by the offense rushing the field and smothering the receiver.
“They were having a blast on that field at the end,” Helton said. “I truly believe that they wish they could play today.”

Matt Karatsu | Daily Trojan
The men’s water polo team takes on Long Beach State Thursday, as the team looks to improve on its 16-1 overall record. This will be the second time USC faces the 49ers this fall, but this time, the Trojans will have home pool advantage. Either way, facing a team for a second time in the same season presents benefits and drawbacks that the team has to consider.
“In some aspects it’s easier because … you are aware of things that they like to do and some of those tendencies,” senior driver Blake Edwards said. “In the same way, they know your tendencies. If we have a really good game, then most likely they are going to correct those mistakes they made against us the second time.”
For the Trojans, this game is a chance to reassert their dominance. When the two sides met earlier this season, USC came away with the 13-5 victory. In that game, the 49ers were able to keep the game even by responding to USC’s goals up until halfway through the second quarter, when the Trojans finally pushed ahead to take a 7-3 lead into halftime. From there, it was USC’s defense that shined through, as senior goalie McQuin Baron ended the game with 12 saves, shutting out the 49ers for the entirety of the fourth quarter.
It is that element that the Trojans want to continue to capitalize on for the rest of the season.
“Defense is the way we win the games, and it has always been like that,” sophomore driver Marin Dasic said. “So we just have to keep practicing doing the same thing. Even if you are having a bad day, ’Quin is behind our backs, and he is doing an amazing job.”
One of the challenges Long Beach State will pose to USC comes in the form of its center, senior Duncan Lynde. He has scored 22 goals so far this season, but his ability to score is not what he is best known for: Lynde plays a very physical game that the rest of the 49ers feed off of. However, the Trojans have prepared for the challenge all week, and feel confident they know what is needed to stop Lynde.
“[Lynde] is their main strength: I would say everything is based around him,” Dasic said. “If we do a good job against him — if our holders do a good job — then I don’t think they can do much. They have decent shooters from the outside, but we have McQuin on the cage so I don’t think it’s going to be a big thing.”
Edwards agreed, saying USC was simply focused on playing its own game.
“Long Beach is a very physical team, so we’re aware of that,” Edwards said. “And [we’re] making sure we don’t engage in their offensive aspects or their play and just focus on playing intelligently and staying focused on the task.”
After taking on Long Beach State Thursday, the team will head north and face UC Santa Barbara on Sunday. Fortunately for the Trojans, they will have two days to prepare for the match — a rarity after the big tournaments they have had the last couple of weekends.
“I think it’s good to have a day in between — just a day to recover, evaluate the previous game and also to refocus for the next game,” Edwards said. “I think when you have
back-to-back games, that turnaround can sometimes be quite challenging.”
Before they look forward to resting up, however, the Trojans will focus on the 49ers. The match on Thursday begins at 5 p.m. at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.

It’s another Thursday in the Daily Trojan sports section and, yet again, I’m writing about the treatment of women in sports media.
I’m sorry, everyone. I don’t want to talk about this. I really don’t. If it was up to me, the phrase “women in sports” would never need to be uttered by anyone, anywhere, because female fans and reporters and athletes would receive the exact same treatment as anyone else.
But that’s not how it is. As women, we can’t ignore that fact because it is something that we are reminded of every single day. Often, it’s by people we can ignore easily — random trolls in our Twitter mentions, nameless commenters on our articles.
Then, on some terrible, awful, no-good, very bad days, it’s a star NFL quarterback smirking and cracking jokes about the supposed humor of hearing a woman talk about receiver routes.
It was a short, simple scene. As usual, Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton stood at the podium for a daily press conference after practice. Jourdan Rodrigue, the Charlotte Observer Panthers beat reporter, asked a fairly straightforward question about the routes the team had been calling for wide receiver Devin Funchess.
Newton smirked as Rodrigue asked the question, then paused before responding.
“It’s funny to hear a female talk about routes,” Newton laughed. Then he answered her question.
There are countless directions I could go from here, but first off, let’s just look at how unbelievably weird this comment is in context. Rodrigue has been the Panthers beat writer for a full year after coming onto the Observer staff last October. She’s not a new face, or a new voice, in press conferences. 
And it’s not like there aren’t women reporting elsewhere in the NFL. Beth Mowins called Monday Night Football weeks ago, and Jemele Hill hosts one of the most popular ESPN shows. Heck, the sports editor of The Auburn Plainsman during Newton’s Heisman-winning season was, in fact, a woman. There is no way Newton got this far without having a “female” ask him an articulate, intelligent question about wide receiver routes.
So why today? Why now? Where did this random and rather embarrassing rash of sexism come from, and why did Newton let it slip in such a public format?
Who knows. Who cares. 
Look, I’ve been a fan of Newton. I like his style, his dance moves and his physical style of play. I respect the difficulty of being a black quarterback in the blazing spotlight of the NFL, and I’ve always thought he comported himself with class, even through difficult personal and professional situations.
This comment was the opposite of classy. It was abrupt and dismissive and unnecessary. And it’s just part of a broader, more pervasive issue in sports as a whole.
A lot of people — mainly men — are trying to wave this whole thing off.
“Why is people making a fuss about cam and the woman reporter he laughed than answered her question but it was funny first time for me to,” tweeted Roddy White, a former wide receiver for the Atlanta Falcons.
So let’s break this down. It’s sexist to laugh at a woman for talking about sports because you are suggesting that her gender has some inherent effect on her ability to enjoy and understand athletics. Therefore, what Newton did was sexist. There’s no argument there. No negotiation. No discussion. 
And if there’s anyone who should know better than this, it’s Cam Newton. As a black quarterback, he has been questioned and ridiculed and targeted for years, probably since he first started playing back in Pop Warner. He knows what it feels like to be considered less than, to be considered not good enough to fulfill the duties of his dream job.
So why put someone else in the same position? Why demean another person who is attempting to do the job she’s been doing for the past year? There’s no reason for that — no excuse — and it’s not something an apology can fix overnight. 
I can’t imagine how Rodrigue will feel when she walks back into work at the Panthers’ training facility tomorrow. I have no idea how many days or weeks or months it takes to gain back the confidence that Newton stole from her that day. 
Being a woman in sports won’t be easy any time soon, but men must start actively choosing to make it less difficult. The NFL must fine Newton for his comments immediately. The Panthers must release an apology. Not a two-sentence quick hit, but something long and heartfelt and devoted to making a change. And Newton must acknowledge the full gravity of what he did, both to Rodrigue and every other woman who heard his words.
We still have a lot of work to do. We still have a lot of minds to change. But today, Rodrigue will go back to work. So will I. So will every other female sports reporter in the country. And we will do that work until that joke isn’t funny to anyone anymore.
A few weeks ago, I wrote about the hope of Mowins’ historic night on Monday Night Football. I wrote about the steps we are taking forward, the progress we are making, the promise that I see so soon in the future of every woman who loves sports. But Wednesday made me think that maybe all that hope, all that promise, is a lot further away than we expected.

Though many students appreciate the low cost and convenience of online shopping, few stop to consider where the products they are buying come from. Keeping increased ethical concerns from online customers in mind, USC alumnus Jonathan Hecht helped found Impakt, an ethical shopping extension, in January. 
Hecht said it’s easy for individuals to make online purchases without knowing where a company makes its products or what kinds of materials it’s using.
Impakt, a browser extension for Google Chrome and Firefox, lets users know what they should be aware of for any specific product or retailer. Impakt works everywhere from e-commerce marketplaces like Amazon to online retailers like Best Buy and Macy’s to brand and company websites like H&M and Sephora.
As a former clerk at the San Francisco public defender’s office and USC Gould School of Law graduate, Hecht realized that he wasn’t suited for the legal field and left it. 
“I quickly realized that being on the front lines wasn’t for me — I wanted to make systemic change,” Hecht said. “What eventually led me to Impakt [was] really trying to make a change directly at the lower level.” 
Hecht worked with fellow entrepreneurs Nida Nizam, Ridge Montes and Chris Shaffer to found Impakt. 
 “[We] realized that when we were trying to make a difference, everyone was going through the same struggle,” Hecht said of the Impakt team formed. “So, we really wanted to find a way to empower people to make a change.”
Hecht explained that the extension works by flagging products that are made by a company that exploits child labor or contributes to climate change, for example. The extension also recommends alternative products that are more likely to match the user’s values. 
Hecht said Impakt uses algorithmic machine learning to gain access to public and government data along with industry studies and reports from universities, non-governmental organizations and market researchers.
Impakt also uses recently published news articles from established news sources to provide information and verify company scandals and lawsuits.
Hecht said that online shopping has become a political act, since users purchase products from companies that support different political causes.
“The thing is we are giving money to these political causes without actually knowing the implications — it’s sort of going in blind,” Hecht said. “Right now, we are just empowering users to know where their money is going instead of giving it to people that they may not otherwise be giving it to.”
Hecht said the Impakt browser extension allows users to rank causes based on what they feel is most important and best aligns with their principles. Impakt then filters the alerts and recommendations, Hecht said. 
The Impakt team supports causes that include environmental sustainability, ending child labor and animal cruelty, diversity in hiring and management and American-made products. The extension has a premium membership option of $1 per month with more features, but environmental sustainability and child labor are two causes available for all users. 
Hecht said Impakt faced challenges building financial and public support. Before partnering with prominent NGOs, nonprofit organizations and the NYU Center for Human Rights and Global Justice.
“The technical challenges haven’t been there so far,” Hecht said. “We are pretty much just combining a series of solved problems into an elegant solution. The problems have had more to do with attraction.”
Impakt’s Kickstarter was launched in September, through which the company aims to raise $29,950 to accelerate development.
“It’s only been five days and we are halfway there, so I am pretty confident that we will reach funding,” Hecht said. “If we don’t, we’ll figure something else out.
“The Impakt team plans to release access to the platform to beta testers in next March and to investors in May.
Sounds like SJW virtue signaling

With flu season quickly approaching, the possibility of students finding themselves bedridden and unable to access food at the dining halls has increased. USC Hospitality’s B.R.A.T. food delivery program aims to help ill students recover while preventing contagion by delivering simple foods straight to their doors.
Following the norovirus outbreak last fall in several university residence halls, which led to temporary closure of EVK dining hall, the B.R.A.T. service will reduce the risk of having sick individuals in dining areas. 
Bananas, rice, applesauce and toast are commonly known as “sick foods,” due to the fact that they are bland and easily digestible. USC Hospitality delivers these items, along with a bottle of water, to ill, bedridden students.
According to Lindsey Pine, a registered dietician for USC Hospitality, the B.R.A.T. meals have existed on campus for years.
“If students have a contagious illness, it is advised that they order a B.R.A.T. meal and do not enter the dining halls and risk infecting other students,” Pine said in an e-mail to the Daily Trojan. She estimates that only 30 students use the service each semester, although more than 3,000 first-year students live in residential colleges, not accounting for sophomores and other students residing in University housing. 
Pine said the B.R.A.T. diet is nationally known and used by individuals, usually for those with digestive problems who are showing symptoms of nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. 
B.R.A.T. meals are available to students in all residence halls on campus every day from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Meals are provided by EVK, Parkside Restaurant and the USC Village Dining Hall.
To utilize the service, a student sends an email containing his or her name, USC ID number, telephone number, building and room number and best delivery time to diningbratmeal@usc.edu. 
Senior managers intercept the message and decide which dining hall will provide the meal, based on its proximity to the specified residence hall. Dining hall personnel deliver the meal to customer service personnel in the residence hall who are responsible for delivering it to the student.
“Every effort is made to ensure the student receives the meal within one hour of the requested time,” Pine said. 
Erik Russell, director of Residential Dining, said he thinks the program is something of which students should be aware.
“This is an opportunity to get the nutrients that you need and give you the food that you need that’s going to help heal your digestive tract and get you back to normal,” he said.  
Although B.R.A.T. meal requests are available year round, Russell said that there is typically a spike in requests during flu season toward the end of the fall semester.
“This program is very important in preventing the spread of illness, especially during cold and flu seasons,” Pine said.
You DT people and use of the term “Free”.  Nothing is “Free”!
It simply means someone else is paying
Sorry, oxygen and sunlight is free depending on where you stand.
 You are welcome for the life lesson!

The Engemann Student Health Center promoted National Depression Screening Day Thursday to raise mental health awareness. The mental health screening is available on the Engemann website.
The free online program was created by the Screening for Mental Health organization in an effort to educate on the importance of seeking help if one exhibits symptoms associated with a mood or mental disorder.
About 75 percent of college students with mental health problems do not seek help for them, according to Engemann.
The mental health screening determines whether surveyees need to reach out to a mental health professional or doctor for a proper evaluation. After completion, the questionnaire shows results, recommendations and referral to treatment resources, depending on the result. 
According to Screening for Mental Health, NDSD is held annually on the Thursday of the first week in October through hospitals, colleges and groups nationwide. 
NDSD is also a part of Mental Health Awareness Month, each October. 
The Academic Culture Assembly runs events through the end of the month to increase mental health awareness and promote the services available for students on campus. 
“Mental Health Awareness Month helps creating open dialogue about good mental health including self-care, proper habits, coping skills,” said Kelly Greco, assistant director of outreach and prevention services at Engemann Counseling Services. 
The month-long programming aims to provide a space for students to discuss the complexity of mental health and advocate for the expansion of mental health resources on campus. 
At the end of the month, Engemann and other organizations will offer resources for wellness and fitness like free yoga classes, flu shots and therapy dogs.
ACA will also hold panel discussions covering topics like how succeed at school with mental health issues as well as a mental health resource fair on Oct. 24.
