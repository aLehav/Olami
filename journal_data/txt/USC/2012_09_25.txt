Barkley joins 30 senior student-athletes from Football Bowl Subdivision teams who have demonstrated success in the classroom and on the field while making a positive impact in their communities.
Barkley, a communication major, carries a 3.21 grade point average, making him one of 16 candidates who have a GPA higher than 3.0. He also took 15 of his teammates on a service trip to Haiti last summer to build four homes and deliver 2,500 pounds of supplies.
Barkley has also traveled to Nigeria, South Africa and Mexico to rebuild houses, distribute supplies and gifts and volunteer at orphanages.
While attending Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, Calif., Barkley and his father Les started the Monarchs for Marines program that raised money for families of wounded and fallen soldiers.
On the field, Barkley has 10,059 passing yards and 92 touchdowns in his USC career. He has the second-most passing completions and third-most total offense yards of  all time for the Trojans.
Through four games this season, Barkley has thrown for 1,005 yards and 12 touchdowns. He is on pace to become USC’s all-time leader in passing touchdowns, passing completions and total offensive yardage.
The Trojans’ first-ever three-time captain is one of eight candidates who were All-Americans last season.
Three other Pac-12 players were nominated for the award, including UCLA punter Jeff Locke, Arizona center Kyle Quinn and California tackle Matt Summers-Gavin.
Other notable nominees include Wisconsin running back Montee Ball, Oklahoma quarterback Landry Jones, Kansas State quarterback Collin Klein and Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te’o.
After the candidates are narrowed down to 10 finalists midway through the season, an official ballot will be distributed to media, coaches and fans. The winner of the award will then be announced during the 2012-13 bowl season.

When the Pac-12 Networks launched on Aug. 15, there were plenty of kinks still to be worked out. Pac-12 Enterprises President Gary Stevenson essentially admitted as much in an interview with the Daily Trojan, but was also clear about the possibilities for the schools in the conference.
“Imagine what being on 24/7 on seven networks and a digital network [can do],” Stevenson said at the time. “The opportunities for students, the opportunities to promote the traditions and culture, the opportunities for coaches to recruit — there are just so many non-financial benefits.”
Quotes about the non-financial benefits of a project that was created almost exclusively to turn a profit should obviously be taken with a grain of salt.
But there was a genuine sense of sincerity in Stevenson’s pitch — he and Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott were interested in creating an unparalleled fan experience while also trying something that had never been attempted before.
In other words, this was — and still is — a daunting project.
I say this because on Saturday, DirecTV subscribers were unable to view the USC- California football game, which the Trojans won 27-9. The contest was shown on the Pac-12 Networks, which have yet to come to an agreement with DirecTV.
In the days leading up to the game, columnists and bloggers across the West Coast weighed in on the matter, many of whom expressed outrage that the two sides couldn’t come to a deal in time.
And while I feel for those who couldn’t tune into USC’s victory, I still have trouble understanding the rationale behind getting so angry over any sporting event unless you’re a Packers fan this week.
Fingers are being pointed at the Pac-12 Networks, DirecTV and everyone in between. But I’m ready to chalk it up to normal business negotiations and move on, because the Pac-12 Networks still have plenty of potential to deliver an impressive product down the line. These things take time.
When the news of a stalled deal began gaining momentum last week, both the Pac-12 Networks and DirecTV came out firing against one another.
DirecTV responded to a letter by the conference by going on the offensive, arguing that the Pac-12 Networks were offered two separate compromises so customers could watch the game even without a deal in place. This is true — DirecTV did, in fact, offer a stand-alone channel option and a pay-per-view system.
The problem is, DirecTV’s offer was deceitful. It was a calculated PR move to put the pressure on the Pac-12 Networks, which hasn’t budged in its negotiations with the television provider. DirecTV can complain that the Pac-12 is forcing subscribers to pay extra for the new channel, but it’s certainly not the first time that’s happened.
One reporter — Jon Wilner from the San Jose Mercury News — helped to illustrate this hypocrisy. As he points out, viewers often times don’t have a choice in what channels the get, and a new Lakers channel set to launch this year will cost all DirecTV subscribers nearly $4 extra every month. It’s not a new concept or a travesty.
In the interest of fairness, I don’t know the ins and outs of the negotiations. But I do know these things take time, and agreements often come when least expected. The Pac-12 Networks got a deal done with DISH. They will come to an agreement with DirecTV.
This isn’t the Big 10 Network — this is a multi-media experiment between TV and Internet. The Pac-12 Networks promise to broadcast hundreds of sporting events that were previously inaccessible to many fans.
So while I, like many others, haven’t had a positive experience with the new conglomerate of channels yet, I’m willing to give Larry Scott and co. a chance to work through the growing pains.
A college sports channel can most certainly succeed, and I’d bank on the Pac-12 Networks to do so.

Amen, Robert McKinnon!  And while the Pac-12 is on its way, take along Pac-12 Enterprises President Gary Stevenson, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott, Utah, and Coloorado.  We were doing just fine until Scott got his Hahvahd nose under the tent.
“The opportunities for students, the opportunities to promote the traditions and culture, the opportunities for coaches to recruit — there are just so many non-financial benefits,” says Gary Stevenson.  Tradition?  Tradition my ass!  Where’s the tradition when we have to give up playing traditional West Coast rivals (this year Washington State and Oregon State) to accommodate mountain states schools, Utah and Colorado.  We gave up watching USC’s longest-running bout with Cal Saturday so that the girls’ tennis promoter, Scott, can gather protesters to pressure a television provider to present his phony network.
What was wrong with the outlets out here who faught over getting USC games on thier weekend lineups?  What was wrong with ten teams playing a round-robin season that left no doubt who its champion was?  What was broke that seemed Hahvahd Scott needed to fix?
Try to figure out how ten university presidents, whom you might expect to be fairly bright, and ten university athletic directors, whom you might not expect to be terribly bright but, nontheless, savvy about sports, could let this self-promoter hornswaggle them.
Fight On!
JLH
The PAC 12 Networks need to go away and leave TV Broadcasting to the Expert BIG BOYS, ABC, ESPN, CBS,
 NBC, etc.
They will probably end up just like Versus did, last year.
We lost a game over that one too!

USC’s first practice of the week Tuesday  carried a bit of a different feel. For the first time this season, the team will not be playing a game Saturday.
Traveling · USC has played two of its first four games this season away from the Coliseum. After a week off, it will hit the road again to face Utah. – Razan Al-Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
 
While the intensity was similar to a regular practice, the Trojans practiced in only shoulder pads and spent a lot more time on conditioning. Additionally, a few coaches were not at practice today because they were out on recruiting trips.
“We want to make sure that we maintain the level we’ve been recruiting at,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said, “and that nationally, players understand the importance of our future. So a lot of guys … will be back [Wednesday].”
Kiffin was adamant that the bye week is an important time not only for recruiting but for current players, as well.
“It’s just critical for us to get guys back,” Kiffin said. “Even though there might not be a number of guys that are out not playing … there are some of those guys who are playing at 80, 90 percent, we can get them fully healthy.”

After USC recorded nine sacks against California, it currently ranks third in the nation with 16 sacks on the season. Led by junior defensive end Morgan Breslin’s 3.5 sacks, USC was able to harass Cal quarterback Zach Maynard throughout most of the game, which impacted his decision-making. Though the defensive line was perceived as a question mark before the season started, it has played well in USC’s first four games.
“Our defensive line in general has played really well for a lot of newcomers that haven’t played before,” Kiffin said.
—
Kiffin also announced Tuesday that freshman linebacker Jabari Ruffin would “most likely” redshirt.
“We’re just looking at some things with him upfront and some pass rush stuff really for next year because he’s so talented,” Kiffin said.
Ruffin will provide depth to an already strong unit. Kiffin also mentioned that running back D.J. Morgan, who had surgery on his knee a few weeks ago, might return to practice this week and hopes the sophomore will be healthy for the team’s next game at Utah on Oct. 4.

In the aftermath of Monday Night Football’s controversial finish between the Green Bay Packers and the Seattle Seahawks, a few players had some things to say on the situation. After an end zone interception occurred in practice, one USC player quipped, “Isn’t that a touchdown?” Additionally, Barkley tweeted last night that the situation was “bananas” and offered his thoughts today. “It was crazy. I’ve never seen something like it,” Barkley said. “But, I think it’s about time the real refs are back in the game.”

USC might be in the BCS national title hunt at 3-1, but quite a bit of attention surrounding the school in recent weeks has centered on injuries.
Hush hush · Senior center Khaled Holmes sustained an injury against Syracuse on Sept. 8 and was carted off the field again during last Saturday’s game. His status, though, remains unknown. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The school instituted new policies in August prohibiting media members from reporting injuries that players sustain over the course of in-season practices. And last Wednesday, USC coach Lane Kiffin stormed out of his post-practice press conference when a reporter asked about the return of an injured player, reigniting the hot topic.
Along with Oregon, UCLA, Utah, Washington and Washington State, USC is one of a handful of Pac-12 schools to have adopted policies related to the prevention of reporting injuries, in order to maintain a competitive edge.
“I know it is not exactly the best thing for you,” Kiffin said earlier this month, when speaking with reporters, “but we are also trying to protect our team.”
Following his abbreviated 29-second press conference, Kiffin called Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott last Friday to explain his recent actions, as well as to express his views on the subject, Scott said Saturday while speaking at halftime of USC’s game against California.
The walk-out had come on the heels of news that the third-year coach had banned Scott Wolf of the Los Angeles Daily News for two weeks after the beat writer had reported sophomore kicker Andre Heidari was scheduled to undergo knee surgery. Though insisting it violated the school’s injury policy, USC reinstated Wolf about two days later.
“[Kiffin] knew I was concerned about what I was seeing and hearing, and there was some tension and frustration between the press and some of our coaches,” Scott said. “He called to make sure I was aware. So he wanted me to hear his point of view.”
In the wake of the controversy, Scott reiterated that the Pac-12’s next athletic directors’ meeting will discuss the possibility of adopting a conference-wide injury policy, similar to the ones used in the NFL. The meeting is scheduled to take place Oct. 8-9 in Berkeley.
“I don’t have a position yet,” Scott said. “Except that, given what I’ve seen, the conference should have a serious conversation about it and decide if there is a conference-wide policy or is there something better left for the schools … There’s divergent opinion on this.”
Over the past month, Scott has spoken with commissioners from the ACC, the Big East and the SEC about the NFL-style reporting system. The ACC is the only one to have enacted a policy current in place, but both the Big East and SEC have explored the option.
Should the conference pass a similar policy, Kiffin said he would be OK with the change.
“The whole thing is not being at a competitive disadvantage,” he said. “We play a number of teams that don’t talk about their injuries. For us to tell them who’s going to play and who’s not, I don’t know how that could make sense to anybody. So yeah, that would solve these issues.”
Players, though, insist they’re largely indifferent on the issue.
“That stuff doesn’t get to us,” said senior safety and team captain T.J. McDonald. “They make a bigger deal in the media than us. We don’t worry about any of that. We just try to stick to the gameplan and do what we’ve got going.”

USC’s student-produced television station, Trojan Vision, now in its 15th year, returns with live shows this week. The current schedule hosts the station’s most ambitious programming yet.
Mission control · Behind the scenes at Trojan Vision’s studios in the Robert Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts, film students and volunteers work to produce a five-day week’s worth of live programming. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
“We definitely have our biggest semester ever this year,” said Trojan Vision General Manager Nathaniel Schermerhorn, a senior majoring in psychology and film production. “We have 120 people in the class [CTPR409] that’s associated with Trojan Vision; we have more shows than ever. Over the past year things have really kind of skyrocketed here.”
The station is now producing six live shows every day.
“Last year was the first year we did two mornings shows every day. This is the first semester that we’re keeping our morning shows, adding two afternoon shows and keeping our staple evening shows,” Schermerhorn said. “The goal is always [to] kind of go above what we’ve done last semester — take a risk on that and then go even farther.”
The station is not only trying to increase the quantity of its shows, but also the quality of its programs. With rooms of high-tech equipment, including the studios with HD cameras that were incorporated last semester, the station is beginning to mimic the professional industry itself.
“We have industry-standard equipment,” Schermerhorn said. “You could walk out of our studio and be able to operate ABC, NBC.”
These changes would not be possible without a full-time commitment from the students involved.
“I’m definitely here at least once a day for an extended period of time. Normally I’ll go here before class, go to class, come back after class. It is a lot of time, but the people and the community makes it worth it,” Schermerhorn said. “It’s just the energy of getting something on air, having to work together to pull through and not having anything else matter but getting onto air. It’s the nature of live television: Once the clock hits 10:30 or 11:30 or whatever, you have to push that button and you have to go live no matter what.”
For the fall season, Trojan Vision plans to unveil several new shows.
Showcase, formerly known as The Cutting Edge, is a half-hour live show with reviews of student films and filmmakers.
“I’m really excited that it’s live because more people will get to know it and watch movies being made on campus,” said showrunner Cassie Casino, a junior majoring in critical studies. “On the show, we see what filmmakers did when they were here, but we also see what changed and who the up-and-coming directors are.”
Casino’s plans for Showcase include interviews with students currently enrolled in the School of Cinematic Arts who are making films on campus.
“I’m really excited to contact alumni from the SCA and have them come in and talk about what the differences are today,” Casino said.
BE the Music is another new show to Trojan Vision, highlighting the best and most inspiring music listened to by college students.
“I came up with BE the Music over the summer,” said showrunner Nate Howard, a senior majoring in communication. “‘BE’ stands for brave entrepreneurs, and the thing I want this program to do is to highlight [those] people. This whole theme is inspiration, what inspires you.”
The show, which will have live performances, exclusive interviews and freestyle rap battles, aims to highlight musicians who are using their talents to inspire change, whether it’s through their words or actions.
“More than anything, we’re being inspired [through the interviews we’ve already done] and we hope to inspire other students to be inspired themselves through what these artists are doing,” Howard said.
Another new show focused on inspiring students is Balance. Run by Theresa Pablos, a junior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, and Laura Coholan, a junior majoring in communication, the 30-minute health and wellness variety show will feature topics from physical fitness to health news.
“Balance is so important, especially for college students,” Pablos said. “At USC one of our mottos is work hard, play hard. By keeping your life in balance it allows you to reach your full potential.”
One of Trojan Vision’s most ambitious new shows is The Toast. The new morning show will run five days a week from 10:30 to 11 a.m. Run by Mandi Brooksbank, a sophomore majoring in business cinematic arts, the show will discuss a variety of issues from fashion to sports to love and relationships.
“It’s a combination of Regis and Kelly, Ellen and Jimmy Kimmel,” Brooksbank said.  “We have different themes for each day like Dance Moves Monday, Fashion-Themed Tuesday, Just Do It Wednesdays, International Travel and Travels of the Hearts Thursdays and Fridays — a bunch of different funny things.”
Brooksbank stressed that she wants the program to be light-hearted.
“We’re featuring quirky, fun, funny things. I don’t want it to be heavy; I want it to be something fun for students to start their mornings with,” she said.
In total, there are 12 shows running on Trojan Vision this semester, ranging in topics from entertainment to politics to student health.
Schermerhorn said he is confident Trojan Vision will be able to handle all its new and returning shows because of the enthusiasm that the showrunners, producers and crew bring to each episode.
“People are passionate about Trojan Vision,” Schermerhorn said. “When people get involved they tend to stay involved and then they tend to bring their friends and their friends get involved. It’s awesome because no matter who you are, what major you are and what year, you can come here [and have a good experience].”

The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, The Lion King, Toy Story: These are the animated films that have captured our hearts, wowed critics and defined our generation. These films catalyzed the new age of animation, kick-starting a rich and fresh visual style and incorporating new and interesting conceits — animated animation, if you will.
Today, however, these films seem like a thing of the past.
In recent years, there have been few memorable, original animated films, beckoning one pertinent question: Where have all the great animated films gone?
Of course there have been critically and popularly successful films since the late ’80s and ’90s, but with a series of sequels, trilogies, 3-D reboots and lackluster releases to account for a large portion of animated works in recent years, the animation film industry is suffering.
A big reason for this comes from laziness on the part of animation studios. Instead of pushing for fresh and interesting ideas, many studios rely on the financial security of popular series because they have already developed a fan following that practically ensures success — if audiences saw a film once and liked it, they’re more inclined to want to see it again or watch the sequel.
Many films have fallen victim to the allure of sequels, trilogies and sagas, and have in turn become one-trick ponies. This summer’s Ice Age: Continental Drift, for example, proved to be another tired installment of the Ice Age series, one that added little to nothing new to the franchise and merely cherry-picked off old ideas.
Not all animated series are doomed, though. The Madagascar series, for example, improved over time; the characters became more developed and the storylines more fleshed out, making the third film the best reviewed yet.
Then there’s the animation studio Pixar. To its credit, Pixar has produced stellar works in the past decade, such as The Incredibles, Wall-E and Up, all of which have proven to be incredibly lucrative and critically successful. And though the Toy Story series did just as well as — if not better than — these original films, it would be refreshing to see future animated works opt for new stories and fresh ideas, rather than rehashing proven success stories.
True, Toy  Story 3 and Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted are the exception to the norm. They prove that not all series lose their creativity in the extension of a story. Still, I — and I’m sure most moviegoers would agree — would like to see something original, something unexpected, something that does more than build upon a popular franchise.
Let’s be very clear about one thing: 3-D re-releases in the form of The Lion King and Finding Nemo are the furthest thing from the answer to that plea. Here, audiences see yet another example of laziness on the part of the studios who refuse to innovate in fear of losing out on the next big series.
Listen up, studios: Audiences aren’t stupid, and they understand that using conversions is the quickest way to capitalize on popular franchises. What I want — and again, I imagine most moviegoers do as well — is for more energy to be put into creativity than conversions.
In order for animated films to reclaim their former glory, we need original films that elevate the art of animation and bring fresh ideas to the screen, rather than re-hashing old, tired series — seriously, no more Ice Age films, please.
But when a film like ParaNorman comes along and wows critics and audiences alike with its refreshing style of animation and interesting conceit, there seems to be hope. It might not be the second coming of animated film, but it is exactly the kind of film that will rejuvenate animation.
As far as Hotel Transylvania and Frankenweenie are concerned, I would really, truly like to say that viewers should watch these films, as well, but I’ve unfortunately read average reviews about both. As with ParaNorman, however, they might not be the saving grace of animated film, but they bring something new to the table: Hotel Transylvania modernizes the classic monster film and Frankenweenie is the first black-and-white, 3-D, stop-motion film. At the very least, it’s encouraging to see something different.
So, for the sake of the next generation, and for the medium itself, animated films need to recapture their former glory; they need to take a step back to the basics and focus on making original works that are visually and conceptually stimulating. Besides, our generation grew up in the golden age of Disney and the following generation lived through Pixar’s prime — it’s only fair that the next generation gets to experience the joys of animation as well.

Right on C. Molly!!   
Keep the faith, as there are groups of us (former Disney/Dreamworks/Pixar folk) banding together to do just what you speak of!   It might be harder for the Animation division of a Major Studio to make the kinds of decisions internally that will create what you speak of, but you WILL see Independent filmmakers creating fresh content which those Studios can then attach themselves to and distribute.  That is a solution which benefits everyone – the Studios, the Investors, the Filmmakers and the Audiences.

With topics ranging from self-mutilation to rape, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is not the easiest film to watch. It is, however, a film worth seeing.
Based on the book of the same title, the film puts a face to Charlie (Logan Lerman), a perceptive high school misfit trying to make it through freshman year. The introverted Charlie is a wallflower, someone who observes the world around him but stays in the corner and keeps his thoughts to himself.

The film begins with Charlie counting down the days until he graduates from high school. Unfortunately for him, he has a long way to go until he gets there — 1,385, to be exact. As Charlie makes it through his first day, it is apparent that he is completely alone. His old friends want nothing to do with him. His sister, a popular high school senior, ignores him. His older brother’s football friends could care less.
With no one to talk to, Charlie begins to write letters to an anonymous friend, someone he has never met himself but believes will understand his situation. Still, despite his wallflower status, some people begin to notice him, namely Patrick (Ezra Miller), an extroverted and openly gay senior, and his cool, yet damaged, stepsister Sam.
Since The Perks of Being a Wallflower’s book release in 1999, readers have identified with Charlie’s experiences, struggles and point of view. With its popularity, some fans were apprehensive about how the book would be interpreted on screen. They feared that the innocence and vulnerability of Charlie’s character, which is expressed through his somewhat whimsical perspectives in the books, would be lost in translation onscreen.
But Stephen Chbosky, who wrote the book and directed the movie, succeeds in establishing Charlie onscreen by creating a vulnerable point of view for the film. Through a loose, somewhat surreal narrative, Chbosky makes the audience feel a little bit detached from the scenes, just as Charlie’s character felt in the original material.
The actors also played a role in elevating the film. Though many of Charlie’s lines in the film could have felt preachy or fake onscreen, Lerman manages to stay true to the heart of Charlie’s character. In an iconic scene from the book in which Charlie is riding through a tunnel, Lerman fully inhabits his character as he locks his eyes on the camera, raises his arms up to the sky and proclaims, “We are infinite.”
The most compelling performance in the film, however, comes from Miller. Miller, who recently came out as gay himself, brings an extra depth and rawness to Patrick’s character. Miller brings his own vulnerability and edge to his performance of Patrick: After Patrick breaks up with his boyfriend, the audience clearly feels the character’s sense of loss and confusion.
Emma Watson, who is arguably the biggest star in the film, plays Sam. Surprisingly, however, Watson forms the weakest link in the main trio. Though she looks the part, she is unable to adopt a convincing American accent. When Watson speaks, she sounds more like a transfer student from England than someone born and bred in Pittsburgh. With so much hype surrounding the Harry Potter star’s new roles, her performance in Perks is a bit of a letdown.
The film’s soundtrack, however, perfectly matches Chbosky’s vision. Songs from The Smiths and David Bowie help to give the story a more contemplative, dreamlike feel, greatly aiding the narrative. The continuous music throughout Perks also makes the film’s quieter moments much more noticeable, which adds an extra sense of poignancy to those scenes.
But there are some points in the film where it feels like Chbosky is trying a little too hard to create emotional moments. He heavily favors symbolic shots and close-ups. Though those shots are occasionally able to give those scenes a sense of immediacy, they sometimes made the scenes feel a little overworked.
Still, when Perks relies on music and narrative instead of special camera tricks to tell the story, the film succeeds. And by the time the credits roll, viewers have become wallflowers in Charlie’s world, experiencing his heartaches, observations and triumphs on the screen.
Logan Lerman looks like a young Paul Rudd. And they are both Jewish. Too bad Rudd is not playing Lerman’s father in this film.

Green Day has long been criticized for its lack of creativity. The trio has been around since the late 1980s and, for the most part, its songs have been consistently built around the same formula — verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus. Though this song structure might seem painfully simple and predictable, Green Day is the perfect example of a band living hard by the ethos “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”
Ninth time around · ¡Uno!, Green Day’s ninth album, fluctuates between mediocre tracks and the band’s characteristic punk anthems. – | Photo courtesy of Felisha Tolentino
Love or hate them, the fact of the matter is that Green Day actually has something that other pop-punk acts don’t: credibility. Formed when its members were teenagers, the trio was part of the legendary 924 Gilman Street scene in Berkeley, Calif. Countless iconic punk bands emerged from that movement, including Operation Ivy, Rancid, Bad Religion, Fugazi, Bikini Kill, L7, NOFX and The Offspring.  Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong even co-wrote Rancid’s 1993 hit “Radio Radio Radio” and was offered a position as the second guitarist for the illustrious punk band, but he  turned it down to focus on Green Day (Rancid recruited Lars Frederiksen in Billie Joe Armstrong’s place and the rest, of course, is history).
When Green Day achieved fame with 1994’s Dookie, the band’s newfound celebrity garnered an intense and borderline crazy reaction from the Gilman scene; famously, a disgruntled fan had spray painted “Billie Joe Must Die” on a wall at the venue. Green Day has been dealing with accusations of selling out for almost 20 years, but the group has chosen to use the hate to refuel its music, churning out hit after hit and single-handedly inspiring the new wave of pop-punk bands, including Blink-182, Good Charlotte, New Found Glory and Fall Out Boy, among others.
All the drama concerning Green Day in the punk scene notwithstanding, the band has still maintained its style, refusing to change for anyone. Fans who pop in the new release ¡Uno! and then the 1990 debut 39/Smooth, will be struck by how similar the two albums sound. After Green Day -directed hate in the punk scene wore down, the band started to get criticism about not changing its style, but, as can be seen on the band’s latest and ninth studio album, Green Day clearly couldn’t care less.
¡Uno!, as the name suggests, is the first in a trilogy of punk power pop albums for the band. After a commercially unsuccessful dabble in different genre styles with 2000’s Warning, the band changed its carefree, snarky music into political rock operas with 2004’s hugely successful and acclaimed American Idiot, which spawned a Broadway production that won two Tony Awards, and 2009’s 21st Century Breakdown. After all the theatricality and social awareness of the band’s last two albums, Green Day has refreshingly gone back to its roots of good old-fashioned and brazen   pop-punk.
Though it’s great to see the band go back to the types of songs that made it famous, ¡Uno! is slightly underwhelming and definitely not the best album in the group’s discography. The record starts out on a strong note with the upbeat, this-is-the-Green-Day-we-know-and-love opener “Nuclear Family,” but then begins to fade into mediocrity to the point where it starts to sound like a rip-off of earlier hits. “Carpe Diem” would be a great track if it didn’t sound like a medley of various past songs in the band’s discography. Songs like “Fell For You,” “Angel Blue” and “Rusty James” have the potential to be larger-than-life, but end up falling short and settling in as disappointingly pedestrian, while “Stay The Night” affirmatively answers the question of whether it’s possible for a song to be too poppy.
That’s not to say that there aren’t any good tracks on the record. The smarmy, foot-tapping arrogance of “Loss Of Control” and the Johnny Rotten-ish vocals on the beat-heavy “Troublemaker” are filled with the defiance that made the band famous. Lead single “Oh Love” is Green Day at its best — a theatrical closer that calls listeners to spark their lighters and hold them high.
Though the songs have such an over-uniformity that they sometimes start to blend into each other, in the middle of all the homogeneity lies “Kill The DJ,” which stands out as a satirical testament to the current mindless state of music production. The music is ironically poppy, complete with a top-40 melody, falsetto in the bridge and a ska-tinged chorus.
Compared to previous albums,  ¡Uno!  is more conspicuously littered with swearing and trite proclamations of defiance. Sometimes, the record just sounds plain bratty. Considering that the trio is made up of men who are hovering around their 40s, the album is borderline ridiculous.
But at the same time, this is Green Day’s trademark — one that the group has built an empire on. So if these are the ingredients to success, by all means stock up on the guyliner and punk hair wax, and don’t tell your parents — ¡Uno! is just the beginning of what promises to be an enjoyable reliving of all the fun parts of teenage angst.

It’s any university’s worst nightmare when students don’t take their own safety seriously. But while USC’s Dept. of Public Safety does an excellent job informing students about potential dangers and risk prevention in the neighborhood, it doesn’t adequately address the threats students face from their own peers.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
The Daily Trojan reported last Thursday that new technology, including surveillance cameras and electronic tracking software, was aiding DPS in apprehending criminals, particularly those who steal students’ electronic devices.
In the same article, DPS told the  Daily Trojan that theft in Fluor Tower was partially a result of its location on the periphery of campus. This mistakenly suggests that crime tends to be an external threat.
But the reality remains: College students can be criminals, too. According to a 2010 study released by MyBackgroundCheck.com, a website you can visit to purchase and share personal background checks, one in 29 college students has a criminal record. Nearly 20 percent of these students were booked for theft, assault or sexual abuse.
According to crime statistics published by DPS, nearly half of all reported burglaries in 2010 occurred on campus. Many students worry about being mugged on the way to and from campus, but on-campus burglaries alone occurred more than twice as often as forcible thefts.
These on-campus thefts tend to happen most frequently in classrooms, libraries and dorms. Though non-students are sometimes granted limited access to these areas, students represent the overwhelming majority of their traffic and are no doubt responsible for some of these thefts.
The “Crime Prevention Tips” section on the DPS website does little to rectify the situation. The site fails to acknowledge the potential for students to be criminals. The section on “Residential Burglary,” for example, warns against the anonymous thief who might come in through an unlocked door or window, but not the across-the-hall neighbor who might see your open door while you go to the bathroom as an opportunity.
Students not only face the possibility of peers stealing from them, but also a more serious threat: sexual assault.
According to statistics compiled by the New York Coalition Against Sexual Assault, one in four college women will be a victim of sexual assault during their academic career, and at least 80 percent of sexual assaults are committed by an acquaintance of the victim. Though these are national statistics, USC is not exempt.
Again, the DPS website is disappointing on its coverage of the subject. It does, at least, feature a page on “Acquaintance Rape,” but the page doesn’t go beyond treating male perpetrators of sexual violence as victims of their own ignorance. It advises male students not to “fall for the common stereotype” that “no” means “yes” — as if sexual assault was a mistake any guy could make. It also advises students to intervene on behalf of other students, commenting, “You may save the woman from the trauma of sexual assault and your friend from the ordeal of criminal prosecution.” To equate the punishment for intentional actions with the trauma of sexual assault further removes the blame from the student perpetrator.
DPS shouldn’t be making these kinds of excuses: not for student-perpetrated theft, and certainly not for student-perpetrated sexual assault. Rather, they should bite the bullet and be honest with the student body about the risks that students pose to each other.
We are a community of 40,000 students, and the ability to be accepted into USC does not guarantee a respect for property or human dignity. Students need to be reminded by public officials that there are members of the USC community who lack respect for their peers, and that we should be protecting ourselves from them as well as non-student criminals.

Badly researched… The DPS website mentions this at the bottom: The above Acquaintance Rape information taken from “Prevention Information” published by the Rape Treatment Center (http://www.911rape.org)… And i don’t find anything wrong in the way they have put the information… Don’t know what’s this noise all about, seems someone was *really* searching a topic to write a angry article…
There is criminal behavior in every group and the USC student body is not immune.
It is time to recognize this.
Looks like our pres. is under the spotlight from within and without. Time to exert a bit of leadership if he doesn’t want all of Sample’s work to be undone. University of Spoiled Children is rearing its ugly head especially on the (Skid) Row and no one seems to be in charge.
Thank you for acknowledging the problem that USC has with student initiated crime.  We who live near USC are experiencing an unprecedented spate of unpleasant and illegal behaviors by USC students. Drunken brawling is not uncommon, even on week days and we have had serious vandalism in the neighborhoods as well. DPS and LAPD are helpful but I hope that USC management can learn how to control their students more effectivly.  
I understand that USC may not want to suspend or dismiss a student for illegal or anti-social behavior if his/her parents have donated to the school…but that may become necessary if USC wants to sustain a reputation for serious academic study…which it has won recently due to the very good work of past President Sample.  
I hope that the current administration will be able to educate the parents of the students as well as the students that although they may be privileged they are not immune from the  consequences for disrkuptive/illegal/anti-social behaviors while attending USC.
Don’t be lazy respect your property and secure it.

Greek Life
As a student at USC, I enjoy the article by Nick Cimarusti titled “Non-Greeks Can Still Have a Social Life.”  However, as a member of USC Greek Life, the use of a somewhat insulting cliché as a hook is disappointing.
As you are probably aware, the Greek system is currently in the process of improving the safety of all students attending parties on The Row.  The fraternities and sororities are all working overtime to try and solve these problems.  Therefore, reading the description of Greek Life as “join[ing] a house, get[ting] wasted every weekend [and] schlep[ing] our way through classes” is especially offensive because of how inaccurate it is.  The Daily Trojan, unlike the Betches article, is written by USC students and should equally represent all communities at USC, Greek Life or not.
Although Cimarusti may have only been trying to write a catchy piece, he presented a controversial cliché without ever denying it later in the article.  He may not have been directly describing USC, but the overall impression of the Greek system as a group of partiers without aspirations or ambitions is still conveyed.  The Daily Trojan should be supportive, or at least not disrespectful, of Greek Life and what it stands for unless it is prepared to also print the stereotypes of GDIs and other communities present at USC, which would be harmful overall.
We are all members of the Trojan Family and I hope in the future your writers and editors make sure that if they do plan on printing an insulting description like the one in this article, they also plan on refuting it.
Moreover, as a student at Annenberg, this article has created a negative opinion of the Daily Trojan in my mind and other Greeks.

The 1.5 generation
This summer, President Barack Obama implemented a new immigration policy that would halt deportation of illegal immigrant children. Individuals under the age of 30 who arrive to the United States before the age of 16 would be eligible for immunity, granted that they meet eligibility requirements, which mirror the requirements of the DREAM Act. Many believe that by waiving immigration laws passed by Congress, Obama has shown disregard for the way our government works. I believe that the president is giving a generation of children the right to live their dreams, which is the foundation that America is built on.
The 1.5 generation. The generation that speaks English fluently, embraces every aspect of culture and identifies themselves as American. Sadly, it isn’t until between the ages of 16 to 18 when these children ultimately learn the truth, when they want to learn to drive and they graduate high school and they learn that their dreams are no longer achievable because of their illegal status. The 1.5 generation was brought to the United States illegally at a very young age with no voice, no choice and a decision that was made for them, yet they are punished for something they did not ask for.
It is important for society to understand that this new immigration policy and the DREAM Act will not automatically grant amnesty to every child. Only about 50,000 children across the nation will actually be eligible based on the requirements set in place. While many may see the policy as a short-term remedy for illegal immigration, it is a start as it will provide the 1.5 generation the  opportunity to follow a strict, structured pathway toward legal status while bettering American society as a whole. Children will have the opportunity to attend higher education or serve in the military. While many are outraged by the short-term solution, the fact of the matter is: How will we ever know if a long-term solution is even possible without giving this a try first?
It’s time for these children to believe and follow their hopes and dreams, in the only way they know how, in the only place they truly know as home: America.

Rayne,
Read the comments following this sorority article:
http://dailytrojan.com/2012/09/11/sororities-should-offer-alternatives-to-accommodate-high-rush-turnouts/
The self-aggrandizing, shallow attitudes are those expected from a 3rd or 4th tier academic university. If this is a sample of the intellectualism of Greeks, USC has more to worry about than excessive alcohol/drugs/sexual behavior on the Row. USC needs to attract and keep attractive and intellectually competent students, not those with caricaturish attitudes and vacuous beliefs. The Row is sinking USC and no amount of sugar coating will be enough, nor does it seem there is sufficient insight and self-reflection from that part of campus to prevent a USC Titanic remake. The Row needs help.
Rayne, 
As noted in Annenberg news, USC #2 party school. You and the Row are getting the same feedback from within and without. Maybe better to acknowledge it and do some soul searching before all the gains in stature USC has made are reversed by the Row culture. Perhaps you are little too close to see the forest from the beer.

No. 13 USC beat the California Golden Bears 27-9 on Saturday, largely because of a strong performance from defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin’s unit. In total, the defense registered nine sacks. Originally credited with seven, the number was later upgraded after the conclusion of the game. The nine sacks were USC’s highest total since 2007 against Oregon State. The Trojans now rank third in the nation in sacks with 16, one behind co-leaders Tulsa and San Jose State.
The defense was led by junior defensive end Morgan Breslin, who tallied 3.5 quarterback takedowns and is now fourth in the country in sacks with 5.5. With 4.5 tackles for a loss of 26 yards on Saturday, he now sits atop the leaderboard with tackles for loss at 10. Breslin was rewarded for his efforts by being named one of the USC Student-Athletes of the Week.
The constant beating quarterback Zach Maynard took affected the entire Cal offense, as they mustered only 250 yards of total offense. The senior Cal quarterback completed 55 percent of his passes, throwing 18 completions in 33 attempts with two interceptions. The running game didn’t fare any better, rushing for 77 yards on 36 attempts for an average of 2.1 yards per carry. The Golden Bears relied heavily on their specials teams, as all nine of their points came via junior kicker Vincenzo D’Amato.
USC continues their Pac-12 schedule with Utah and Washington coming up over the next two games. Utah is 107th in sacks allowed while Washington is 83rd.

This advice will help you stumble a little bit less while walking on the notoriously uneven pavement of The Row. Take a stand, quite literally, against finding yourself two meters from where you intended because you’re stuck in the grass or cracks in the pavement.
To solve these problems, ditch the high heels and wear wedges. With all fashion, comfort is important but style shouldn’t be sacrificed in the process. Wedges offer you the much-needed support for college parties and you won’t be “that” girl who can’t walk in six-inch heels. Instead of being the girl who’s well-known for carrying her heels while walking home in bare feet, be the one to who is smart and casual by wearing wedges.
With a fashion-savvy attitude, be sure to check out Steve Madden wedges for going out. These shoes are always affordable and trendy. Be careful when purchasing this brand at locations outside of Steve Madden stores because they tend to be very overpriced. Steve Madden wedges allow you to achieve a more daring and edgy outfit by incorporating studs and neon into the brand’s collections.
For the daytime, check out the secret wedge. On the outside it appears to be a normal flat but inserted in the shoe are a few inches of wedge. These shoes are the perfect way to add a few more inches to your legs without letting anyone know you’re faking it, and they come in many shapes and styles. Matiko is a perfect place to find casual boots with this hidden wedge. What’s wonderful about these shoes is that they are extremely comfortable and make a perfect fit for class.
