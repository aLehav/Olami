One of college athletics’ most storied rivalries is right around the corner, as the women’s volleyball team takes on UCLA Wednesday in its conference opener at the Galen Center.
The Trojans have opened conference play against the Bruins for the past three years. Last year, they clinched a 3-2 win at Pauley Pavilion, but fell to the Bruins at home to close out the regular season. Now, the Trojans have a chance to defend the Galen Center court once again.
“Being at home after being gone for three weeks, combined with opening Pac-12, combined with UCLA, I don’t know if you could line up more things in a row that could produce energy,” head coach Brent Crouch said. 
 No. 14 USC  has already faced six other ranked opponents, so going head-to-head with No. 17 UCLA is nothing new for the team. Out of those ranked opponents, the Trojans have defeated four, including marquee wins over No. 5 Kentucky (3-1) and No. 4 Florida (3-1). Despite the wins, the coaching staff is still prepared to help contain the teams’ emotions against their rivals. They believe they will be able to channel that energy into a victory. 
“We’ve been practicing on Galen floor for the last two days and you can just feel the vibe starting to build,” Crouch said. “Players are really excited to be home.” 
But beating the Bruins will be no easy task. On top of the emotions surrounding the crosstown rivalry game, the Trojans also have to find a way to answer the offensive force UCLA will present. UCLA outside hitter Mac May is averaging 3.37 kills per set while junior middle blocker Madeleine Gates boasts a hitting percentage of .358. Part of USC’s defense might be found in senior libero Victoria Garrick, who currently averages 4.76 digs per set.
“If we can serve really tough and shut their left sides down, then we can probably live with Gates going off,” Crouch said. 
He added that Garrick’s experience will pay dividends. 
“This has been her seventh time playing UCLA and she has been there and done it, so she is going to know how to deal with the emotion of it,” Crouch said. “She’s been doing a good job each week … it feels good to have a senior back.” 
The Trojans are approaching this game like they have been preparing for all their other games this season: watching footage, doing their research on the players and building off last years’ experience. 
“It’d be great to start off Pac-12 with a win against a rival,” Crouch said. “And it would be great to get off on the right foot in the conference and I think we will have a step forward with how we are playing regardless if we win or lose, but I think we have a nice shot at winning.”

In the midst of a two-game losing streak, the USC football team aims to solidify its defensive game plan that conceded 37 points in the defeat to Texas.
After practice on Tuesday, head coach Clay Helton highlighted how team struggled with his third down defense, the catalyst that allowed Texas to catch fire. 
“I think it’s going to be critical in this game,” Helton said. “They’ve done tremendous in pass rush. Ten sacks on the year in three games right now, and they’re doing a great job protecting the quarterback … only giving up two sacks.”
The defense seemed re-energized in practice, with players constantly high-fiving following good plays and giving motivation after bad ones. After going up 14-3 in the first quarter, USC gave up 34 unanswered points as freshman quarterback JT Daniels put up yards but was unable to find the red zone. 
In addition, USC struggled to stop Texas from steadily marching down the field on third down; Texas went 10-of-19, and USC’s defense eventually gave in to fatigue. Helton also discussed the team’s ground game.
“I think the biggest thing offensively is to understand that the run game must go,” Helton said. “I was very pleased with the quarterback and the wide receiver, the skill athletes responded in the passing game, but obviously the best friend to a quarterback is the running game.”
When asked what went wrong on offense, Helton reaffirmed his support of offensive coordinator Tee Martin, who has faced some criticism following USC’s performance.
“Probably the miscommunication,” Helton said. “The down on fourth and one. That’s one that’s just in the pit of my stomach, could not have had a better play call. I thought Tee called a perfect play … just had a miscommunication with our offensive line.”
The Cougars are not afraid to gamble on extending their drives, and they are not afraid to go for the home run plays either; senior quarterback Gardner Minshew II is third in the nation with 1,203 passing yards to go along with eight touchdowns and three interceptions. Minshew has already thrown 165 passes this year, over half as many as he attempted last season in 10 games at East Carolina. 
On the other side of the field, Daniels has 819 yards with one score and three picks on 117 passes. The Cougars have put up 131 points in three games and feature a deep receiving core, with five players who have between 125 and 290 yards. Helton is taking note of Wazzu’s fourth down threat.
“They are a four down team,” Helton said. “If you look at them, in three games, they’ve already gone for it on fourth down 11 times. You really have to be able to play them as a four down team. It’s not only third, but it’s fourth so we got some extra third down work, especially on defense today.”
Gustin’s Suspension
Senior captain and outside linebacker Porter Gustin will miss the first half of Friday’s game after being ejected for targeting in the third quarter against Texas.
Redshirt junior defensive lineman Christian Rector, who forced and recovered a fumble, shared his thoughts on the targeting rules.
“We want to play fast,” Rector said. “You see it in the NFL too — the increased penalties on targeting calls and players getting ejected and fined. The game’s definitely changed in that sense.” 
Rector also preached his confidence in the fundamentals that the defense has been practicing since last spring. 
“We go out there with the mindset that we get the ball back and put it in JT’s hands,” he said. “We practice that every day. We don’t let anybody run through our defense without trying to poke at the ball, rip the ball out … we preach that a lot in camp and in practice.”
Injury update
Sophomore starting kicker Chase McGrath is out for the season with a torn ACL. McGrath was 6-of-8 on field goals and 6-of-6 on extra points. 
Sophomore right guard Andrew Vorhees is a questionable  choice to play against Washington State after straining his MCL against Texas.
Sophomore offensive tackle Austin Jackson sat out due to sickness but should return Wednesday.

Redshirt sophomore Savannah DeMelo and the women’s soccer team will start Pac-12 play this week against Washington. (Tal Volk | Daily Trojan)
I hate to admit it, but when I first got to USC, I was a little bummed that there was no men’s soccer team. I knew that I wanted to cover soccer, so when I found out the school didn’t have a men’s team I thought I had lost my best opportunity. However, I have now realized that I was guided by an ignorant and misogynistic thought process. I was wrong. Very wrong.
All of my encounters so far with watching women’s soccer at the collegiate level have been beyond entertaining. I have covered and played high school soccer for many years. My hometown team, Millburn High School, is recognized as one of the best soccer high schools in New Jersey. I have seen a lot of talented players coming through the ranks at Millburn, but I don’t think I have seen players as skilled as the women on the USC soccer team.
I’ve never seen someone so dominant in possession as redshirt sophomore midfielder Savannah DeMelo. She is gifted beyond belief. She glides past players with ease and is as positionally smart as any non-professional player I have ever seen.
Senior forward Leah Pruitt is the hardest working forward I have seen live at a non-professional level. The only time she ever stops running and helping her team is when she is on the bench. These two players have mastered their craft to the most elite level possible.
When someone masters their craft as these women have done, it is expected that they will receive some kind of reward for their skillset. In many cases, this means that they will get paid a lot of money once they turn pro. However, the sad reality is that these two amazing athletes will never get paid the amount they deserve post-graduation simply because of people with the same ignorant and misogynistic thought process I had before ever watching the Women of Troy play.
Broadcast companies are hesitant to claim the rights to women’s sports because they believe that they will not produce the same amount of ratings and revenue as men’s sports do. Or, if they do claim the rights, they are paying a lower amount than they do for the rights to men’s sports.
For example, according to The Washington Post, ESPN and the WNBA agreed upon a rights fee of $25 million. In comparison, LeBron James will make $153.3 million over four years for the Lakers or roughly $38 million a year. So, one basketball player is making more money in his yearly salary than the entire WNBA makes from its television deal.
James fully deserves his money. He is an amazing basketball player who drives a lot of attention toward the NBA. However, there are also female athletes who are dominant within their sport and deserve to get paid at an elite level. That being said, these women won’t get paid until people change their views about women’s sports.
People need to understand that women’s sports are just as entertaining, physically and tactically sound as men’s sports. However, people will not fully grasp this concept until they can actually watch it. That means it is up to broadcasting companies to broadcast more women’s sports and, furthermore, do a better job marketing and advertising them.
The U.S. women’s national soccer team are defending World Cup champions. That means that the United States is producing the most dominant soccer talent in the world. Yet, Lifetime, a channel not necessarily known for its sports, only broadcasts one NWSL game a week. One can only imagine how little that broadcasting deal is worth.
The USC women’s soccer team completely changed my view on female sports. They play nice, entertaining soccer and at an elite level. I believe that if USC had a men’s team, I would find watching them play equally as entertaining as I do watching these women play. Sports are about pure talent and class, and women’s sports have an equal amount of talent and class as do men’s sports. Broadcasting companies should take a chance and pay up to claim the rights to women sports. People need to be more open-minded about female sports and get over the belief that they are less entertaining than male sports. These women deserve to get paid equally for being as equally dominant at their craft.
To players like DeMelo and Pruitt, I’m sorry for my prior ignorant, misogynistic belief that this wouldn’t be as fun to cover as a men’s team. I’m proud to say you proved me wrong and made me feel like an idiot along the way.
The bottom line: Imagine being the best at your craft and getting paid nothing for it. That should not be the case and needs to change.

“99.9 percent good vibes.”
This is how John Papachristos, a partner in the South L.A.-based food joint Olympian Burgers, describes his experiences with his restaurant. 
Situated on Vermont Avenue — a five-minute drive from the University —  Olympian Burgers resembles an old-school diner with tiled floors, booths along the windows and a queue of customers snaking along one side of the establishment. Customers waiting to order can watch Olympian Burgers’ dishes, including french fries and burgers, being prepared on the grill and fryer located right behind the counter. 
The walls are lined with pictures of local schools, a testament to Papachristos’ commitment to his community. Since moving here, Papachristos has watched the area drastically improve in diversity and safety to become a place he is happy to call home.
On the grill · Olympian Burgers first opened its doors in 1988. Today, the joint is a staple in the South L.A. community. (Julia Rosher | Daily Trojan)
Olympian Burgers is not new to this area and has conjured up quite a fan base. While the original restaurant opened in 1988, Papachristos took over in 2001, four years after he came to Los Angeles — his wife’s hometown — from Greece. Papachristos saw something that many others failed to see in South Los Angeles: opportunity. With a knack for seizing opportunities, he turned a small local restaurant into a thriving business.
Behind the ordering counter, the kitchen bustles with smiling workers navigating through racks and racks of charbroiled chicken, a house specialty. This dish is served with large portions of crisp-skinned, fall-off-the-bone-soft pieces of chicken, along with a slice of lemon and well-seasoned fries. The aroma of the freshly marinated chicken pieces is enough to conjure growling stomachs and salivating mouths. 
Papachristos says that this dish is Olympian Burgers’ claim to fame, but glancing around the restaurant, it’s clear that there’s something for everyone given the plethora of bestsellers on the menu. The restaurant is populated by people of all ages — from a woman enjoying burritos and burgers with her two sons to an elderly couple splitting a sandwich and fries. 
“It motivates me to see that the customers are happy and that keeps me going,” Papachristos said, turning his gaze toward the occupied tables surrounding him. 
Beyond his customers, Papachristos cares deeply about his colleagues. During an interview with the Daily Trojan, he insisted on getting “all the guys” together for a picture. Looking at the line of people with white baseball caps huddled up on either side of him, putting their arms around one another, it’s easy to tell that he created a family out of employees and coworkers. 
Julia Rosher | Daily Trojan
He insists on treating people with respect and honesty and being flexible with mistakes. 
“We give them a second and third chance,” Papachristos said. “It’s not like working in a corporate environment.” 
Papachristos attributes his choice to create such an environment to his childhood in Greece, where family was central to everyday life. Papachristos has a unique ability to make people feel at home; as a result, some of his employees have worked with him for over a decade.
The nature of this work environment brings him back to the restaurant every day at 9 a.m. and keeps him there until after 7 p.m. Despite all of his time and effort spent at Olympian Burgers, Papachristos is quick to attribute his restaurant’s success to loyal customers and the hard work of his employees. 
“Just for me, it is very important to pick what you love to do and what you like to do and sometimes what you’re capable of doing,” he said. 
The strategy has served him well, judging by his ever-present grin. In the future, Papachristos dreams of expanding the business, but remains true to his family roots when talking about his hopes of providing his son, a senior in high school, with a good education. 
He has one piece of advice for college students, a maxim that he embodies through his character and through Olympian Burgers: “There are no limits.”

What could be said of Frank Sinatra that hasn’t been said before?
This was the conundrum Gay Talese found himself in when Esquire commissioned him to write a profile of the singer in 1965. At the time, Sinatra was at the height of his stardom; hundreds of interviews of him had already been published. Leery of journalists, sick with a sore throat and perhaps more powerful than a Mafia boss, Sinatra did not once speak to Talese. 
So instead, Talese talked to his son, Frank Sinatra Jr. He talked to his press agent, Jim Mahoney. He almost talked to his first wife, Nancy, but Mahoney got to her early and expressly forbade it, much to Talese’s chagrin. And he even talked to the woman who was in charge of carrying around Sinatra’s toupees “in a tiny satchel.” By the end, he had talked to over 100 people with varying degrees of proximity to Sinatra, all orbiting him like planets around a star. And what emerged was one of the best celebrity profiles ever written — a portrait of a man who had reached the very top and had nowhere left to go. 
Talese is known as one of the pioneers of New Journalism, a form of storytelling that uses additional flair and flourish and occasionally takes certain liberties to reporting. Practiced by the likes of Tom Wolfe, Joan Didion and Truman Capote, it expanded the scope of what journalism could be. His narrative nonfiction style resembles John McPhee’s, another novelist I idolize — or, rather, McPhee’s style resembles Talese’s. 
Talese set the standard for magazine profiles today. Without him, we wouldn’t have Taffy Brodesser-Akner’s kooky, indulgent profile of Gwyneth Paltrow; Caity Weaver’s unexpectedly erudite profile of Cardi B; or Edith Zimmerman’s breathless, smitten profile of Chris Evans — and these are just a few examples. 
Sinatra has a special place in my heart, ever since I watched him alongside Gene Kelly in the 1949 film “On the Town.” He couldn’t hold a candle to Kelly’s dance moves, but Kelly’s thin, reedy voice was no match for Sinatra’s smooth dulcet tones. Throughout high school, “Frank Sinatra’s Greatest Hits” was the soundtrack that accompanied my SAT studying and essay writing.Sinatra has always seemed remote, untouchable, a God among men, by virtue of his astronomical success. By refusing to grace Talese with so much as a “Scram!,” Talese had the opportunity to write a profile that only added to Sinatra’s distance and inaccessibility. But instead, he did the opposite — and the result humanized one of the most imposing and influential men in history.

Midterm elections are under 50 days away. The one thing political leaders across the spectrum can agree on is how monumental this election season is. We’ve known from the get-go that President Donald Trump’s political rise has spelled out the requiem of politics as usual in America. But for me, it took a summer in Washington, D.C., the epicenter of political activism, to recognize the colossal stakes of the midterms. This summer, I also worked to overcome years of internalized misogyny and understand the potential I have to impact my surroundings as an individual.
I left my comfort zone as a native Californian this summer, and trekked to the East Coast for the first time in my life to do field and communications work for NARAL Pro-Choice America, a leading reproductive rights group. What followed was life-changing. Prior to this internship, I had worked for feminist nonprofits and political action groups, including an incredibly fulfilling and educational internship with the National Network of Abortion Funds. That’s because since I was a teenager, my personal experiences with sexual harassment and barriers to reproductive health care turned me into an ardent feminist and advocate. From early on, I’ve scrambled to educate myself and do everything I can to support other girls and women.
Before this summer, I viewed my writing as a service to give back to feminism and believed that was enough — until I realized it wasn’t. It wasn’t enough. Not in a world where babies and young children with disabilities are being senselessly ripped from their parents’ arms, screaming and crying, and put into cages. Not in a world where children and women fleeing rape and domestic abuse in their home countries are being turned away at U.S. borders. And certainly not in a world where, suddenly, we are one Supreme Court justice away from thousands of American women dying due to of unsafe abortions. And when tragedy strikes at the heart of what most matters to you, words suddenly lose all meaning, all that’s left is action.
When I sought help from my local women’s health clinic, its staff didn’t support me with an eloquent think piece of impassioned words and sentiments. These people supported me through actions and with compassion, empowering  me to become the person I am today. As I considered what the likely loss of Roe v. Wade’s protections would mean for me and other American women, it was my experiences with the infinitely resilient staff of reproductive health clinics that kept coming to my mind.
The people I worked with never stayed down for long. We were constantly organizing: collaborating with the offices of senators and Congress members and other leading advocacy groups to stage rallies and speaking events; protesting on the Hill, in front of the Supreme Court Building and outside the White House; leading phone banks and postcard writing sessions; launching mass social media campaigns; engaging in voter registration and education efforts. In taking action and learning crucial organization  skills, I shed my hopelessness — in the country and in myself — and traded it for determination.
America, it’s easy to question how you personally can make a difference in a country fractured by voter suppression, mass incarceration and unrelenting ignorance and bigotry — all the more so as a young woman. If my years of writing about feminism and other issues related to women’s rights on the internet have taught me anything, it’s how easy it is to be convinced nothing you believe matters, when everything you say either is dismissed or invites harassment.
No matter what I write, what I hear back is always the same: No amount of facts or stats is ever going to convince internet commenters that abortion and birth control are about health, not irresponsible, promiscuous women. And I never realized, until this summer, just how much my voice as a young woman was silenced. It wasn’t until my summer of organizing, rallying, solidarity and mentorship that I found hope and self-confidence I’d never had before. It wasn’t until watching a mass movement of resistance grow out of activist work I’d contributed to, or until calling my representatives every day and watching them release statements and pledges affirming my views, that I realized the power in my hands as one single woman.
That’s not to say I won’t be writing anymore — if anything, I’ll be writing more, as I have by finishing my first book this summer. But it also means I’ll be organizing and rallying, too. And certainly, I’ll be at the polls in November.

College application season is quickly approaching, and with admission rates plummeting among selective colleges across the country, high school students are cracking open SAT study guides and getting comfortable. However, while the SAT is a standardized exam, recent research shows the playing field is far from level.
In a working paper released in August, “Take Two! SAT Retaking and College Enrollment Gaps,” researchers Joshua Goodman, Oded Gurantz and Jonathan Smith collected data on over 10 million students who took the SAT from the high school classes of 2006 to 2014 to evaluate the effect of retaking the exam on college prospects. On average, taking the SAT a second time improved admissions-relevant super scores by roughly 90 points out of 2,400, with the biggest improvement among low scorers. Doing so made students more likely to enroll in a four-year (as opposed to two-year) institution. The reality is, though, while half of SAT-takers sit for the exam more than once, low-income and underrepresented minority students are far less likely to take it a second time than white, Asian American and affluent students. In fewer words, they are more likely to miss out on the 90-point bump that could easily be the difference between an acceptance and a rejection.  
Retaking the SAT increases four-year college enrollment by an average of 13 percentage points, particularly for low-income and underrepresented minority students. Because four-year colleges often have higher graduation rates, sitting for the exam more than once actually is correlated with both getting into college and getting a degree. 
Those who do not retake the SAT miss out on that boost. It turns out, though, that most of them are already limited in other ways: Students with a family income over $100,000 are 21 percent more likely to retake the SAT than students with a family income below $50,000, according to the paper. 
Low-income and underrepresented minority students are less likely to get high scores and enroll in a four-year college to begin with, meaning the consequences of only taking the exam once are more substantial for them. It is a vicious cycle; those who start ahead, stay ahead, and those who were held back right away stay behind. 
In fact, the paper suggests that eliminating disparities in retake rates could close up to 20 percent of the gap in four-year college enrollment between poor and affluent students who take the SAT, and up to 10 percent of the gap between white students and those who are black, Hispanic or Native American.
It is important to get to the core of why these retake discrepancies exist in the first place and why those who would benefit most from retaking the SAT rarely get to. Earlier research has clearly shown that information about the enrollment process is a key factor of gaps in college enrollment. Recently, a study at the University of Pittsburgh indicated that low-income and underrepresented minority students get less help in navigating the difficult application process; they tend to overestimate costs, miss crucial deadlines and not apply to selective colleges they are qualified to attend.
There are disparities in information and resources that permeate the application process, and such disparities likely contribute to retake rates, too. The College Board, which administers the test, offers fee waivers that let eligible students take the SAT twice and send their scores to colleges at no cost. It is imperative that these shortcuts both exist and are marketed toward the students who need them most, but the low retake rates show that they have barely made a dent.
The College Board should make a concerted effort to offer transparent and universal access, and go the extra mile for the demographics that would benefit from a push. 
The paper showed that over 40 percent of minority SAT-takers first took the test in the 12th grade, compared with under 20 percent of white and Asian American students. If students are encouraged to take their first SAT earlier, they would in turn have more time to retake the exam, improve their scores and strengthen their applications. It is far from a permanent solution, but certainly a step to leveling the playing field.
Alternatively, a number of states have started offering the SAT or ACT during school hours at no cost and requiring students to take it. A study examining the effect of mandatory college entrance exams found an increase in four-year enrollment for students who were low-income or who were less likely to take the exam in the absence of the policy. Hopefully, these positive results will encourage states and school districts to offer opportunities for students to take (and retake) the SAT, free of cost.
Mitigating the gaps in college enrollment is a daunting, difficult task. However, when it comes to the specific matter of retaking the SAT, the reasons are clear, and the most effective way to combat structural oppression is with policy. The College Board must take responsibility as a key player in college applications, address its shortcomings and actively provide supplementary resources to low-income and underrepresented minority students. 
There is a facade of objectivity that surrounds the SAT, and it is breaking down. It is time to account for the barriers that subtly and quietly hinder some students throughout the application process while they benefit others.

Christopher McMorran, the Director of First-Year Affairs for USG, said giving students a formal seat in the search process would foster a better relationship between the administration and students. (Hyeonmi Shin | Daily Trojan)
The Undergraduate Student Government unanimously passed a resolution asking for two seats on the USC Presidential Search Committee during Tuesday’s meeting. The resolution follows USG’s joint statement with Graduate Student Government released last Thursday condemning the administration for not including students in the formal search process for a new president. 
The statement said leaving students off the committee was a “disservice to the very individuals the University failed to protect,” and that including students in the decision-making process would be vital to ensuring students’ needs and interests are met.
“The resolution passed this evening is essentially just a formal declaration from the elected representatives of the student body that the student body is pretty pissed about all of this,” said Christopher McMorran, USG’s director of first-year affairs. “[The resolution] does put pressure on the board to show that it’s not just a few people that are mad about this.”
McMorran said that giving students formal seats in the search process would foster a better relationship between the administration and the student body and would allow the administrators to “achieve the culture change” it has always promised.
“I think having students be a more formalized position to give input would legitimize a lot of these processes the University is going through right now,” he said.
Co-Chief Diversity Officer Milton Dimas said that the problem with student representation reflects a broader, ongoing mission to integrate student voices into the University’s administrative process. 
“Having student voices on there is just the start,” Dimas said. “There should be student representatives in basically everything that the administration decides.”
He added that more student representation in the administration will hold them more accountable for future decisions they make in the future.
Aside from the resolution for the search committee, Dimas also criticized Provost Michael Quick’s recent memo regarding free speech on campus. 
“We don’t need an investigation or a magnifying glass to distinguish hate speech from speech,” Dimas said. “More importantly, if student voices were truly valued, administrators like Provost Quick would know about the racism, sexism, xenophobia, islamophobia, classism and many other -isms and phobias that take place every single day on this campus.”

For the last few weeks, Robert Evans has been without a home. He’s moved from friend’s house to friend’s house with nothing but his work clothing, crashing only for sleep and then heading to his graveyard shift as a security guard in the evenings.
Evans’ life, like that of many residents along the 1100 block of Exposition Boulevard, has been uprooted. He and other former tenants were forced to leave their homes in August after losing a nine-month battle with the new owners of the buildings, who aim to renovate the units in order to rent them out to students, according to eviction notices that the Daily Trojan obtained.
Kim Chung Suk and Kim Hae Jung, who own a strip mall in Koreatown and other properties in Los Angeles, bought the buildings for $8.5 million in September 2017. They served tenants with eviction notices a month later, giving them 60 to 90 days to move out. The evictions are part of a pattern of displacement in the area surrounding USC, as developers appeal to University students who are typically able to afford higher rent than most local residents.
“Some of these investors, they’re going to renovate student housing, make it livable for the students,” said Evans. “But they’re not going to let you know how many families they put out, how many families they put on the streets in order to make your school and your experience at the university better.” 
Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
The Kims declined to comment on the evictions.
The University said it has been a longtime partner of the community. It provides referrals, information and representation to local community members who face housing problems through the USC Housing Law Clinic.
“The university has increased student housing by 35 percent in recent years to help reduce pressure on the local market,” the University said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “In addition, USC has provided the city with $20 million to support affordable housing initiatives and established a housing law clinic to support members of the community who live around the University Park Campus.”
Searching for homes
Though some former Exposition Boulevard tenants have found new homes, others have been staying with friends and family or at hotels. Paul Lanctot, a caseworker for the South L.A. branch of the anti-eviction advocacy group Los Angeles Tenants Union, estimates that eight or nine families are still looking for a place to live, with some searching as far as West Covina and the San Fernando Valley.
Evans and his cousin Steven Baldwin are among those still searching. Evans and Baldwin initially lived in the same complex with Baldwin’s mother and a few other family members, but after the final day in their Exposition Boulevard home, the family of eight was forced to split up. Evans set off on his own, while Baldwin and his children began their temporary stay with his mom, who found a two-bedroom apartment on Crenshaw Boulevard.
Others like Jackelin Lopez, a tenant of six years and stay-at-home mom, and Tracie Pierson, a tenant of seven years who is disabled, have found new places to live in other regions of Los Angeles. After about six months of searching, Lopez’s family was able to find a new home in Mid-City, but insead of paying $1,600 a month for a three-bedroom home for the family of five, they now pay about $1,200 for a one-bedroom. 
Pierson has found a home in Gramercy Park about six miles south of Exposition Boulevard. She now pays $1,790 for a slightly smaller home, about $400 more than she had initially, as well as an additional $268 for a storage unit.
“Close to USC, they aren’t renting to people like us,” Lopez said in Spanish. “They are exclusively preparing the buildings for the students of USC. I know that the students need somewhere to live while they’re here, but we also need a place to live.”
Lopez and Baldwin have children who go to school in the USC area. Baldwin’s sons have been taking Lyft between school and their temporary home every day. Lopez’s daughter also continues at the same elementary school.
“She cries because she doesn’t want to change schools,” Lopez said. “I tried, but she says she doesn’t like other schools — she likes her school because it’s the only one she knows.”
“It’s a losing battle”
The residents, with the guidance of the South LA Tenants Union, had initially attempted to settle the evictions with the owners as a group, offering to accept relocation compensation and a six-month grace period, Lanctot said. However, they were unable to settle and went to trial individually as 20 separate cases from April to July.  
The tenants and the South LA Tenants Union were initially planning to pursue a lawsuit to win residents monetary damages because of the allegedly poor conditions the units were under and what they described as harassment from the owners, but were unable to get lawyers to represent them for the suit.
Though the majority of evicted tenants received relocation compensation from the owners as part of their settlement, most received between $1,000 and $5,000 per unit, which typically had to be split among family members.
Most tenants did not receive a trial by jury, and were tried by a judge instead, because the evictions were legal and the units were non-rent controlled units. The owners were not required to provide a legitimate reason for eviction to the tenants and were not required to provide special relocation fees, which typically range between $8,000 and $21,000 for buildings under rent control, according to the Los Angeles Housing + Community Investment Department.
Most tenants ended up negotiating settlements, which allowed them to stay until Aug. 31 with some compensation, and were able to keep the 10 months of back rent they did not pay while they were fighting the eviction.
Only Pierson received a trial by jury, but she settled rather than fight the eviction because of her Section 8 voucher, which she would have risked losing. About four of the units were under Section 8, a government-sponsored program that provides rent subsidies to landlords on behalf of low-income families, according to Lanctot.
“We didn’t really want to go to court,” Evans said. “In court, it’s a losing battle anyway because the laws are stacked against us. Our main goal was to get everybody on the block to have a decent amount of money [and the time] to be able to find a place.”

An uncertain future
The tenants who chose to fight the eviction spent the last 10 months protesting and spreading awareness of their situation. In April, several tenants and supporters visited the owners’ house in Buena Park for peaceful protest. They also showed up at a shopping mall in Koreatown owned by the Kims and at their daughter’s house in Fullerton, since she represented the Kims’ estate at Pierson’s trial.
“It’s [to show] this is what happens if you do this to people, and we’re not going to let you do what you want when you throw 80 [people] out on the street,” Lanctot said. “I think the process of these protests really opened a lot of people’s minds that you don’t have to accept what is and you can fight it even when the law is not on your side.”
Now that the tenants have left Exposition Boulevard, they no longer have a familiar community to call home.
“It was a good community,” Evans said. “Everybody knew everybody. If people needed help, they’d help each other … I’ve talked to a lot of people and they said they don’t think they [will] ever find a place that was like that.”
