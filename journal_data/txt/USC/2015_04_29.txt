After finishing its regular season in style with a 16-4 romping of conference foe San Diego State last Saturday, April 25, the USC women’s lacrosse team will begin their postseason on Saturday at the MPSF Conference Tournament in Denver, Colorado.
Though the team has yet to find out who they will match up with — that will be determined by the winner of a Friday night bout between Oregon and tournament host Denver — the Women of Troy will be riding a fair amount of regular season conference confidence after finishing second in the MPSF with an 8-1 record and a 12-4 record overall.
Only undefeated MPSF Conference champion Stanford finished with more conference wins than the Women of Troy, who made significant gains in just their third year as a program. Last year, the team finished 9-9 overall after tallying an 8-10 record in their inaugural 2013 season.
USC’s only losses on the year came against ranked opponents, and among their conference victories they boast victories over each potential Saturday opponent.
The Women of Troy defeated Oregon 13-11 on the road on Friday, April 3 behind four-goal outbursts from two sophomore attackers in Michaela Michael and Cynthia Del Core. The team defeated Denver in their final home game of the season on Sunday, April 12 by a decisive 16-4 score.
USC had four players tally hat tricks in the rout, as junior attacker Caroline Cordrey, junior midfielder Amanda Johansen, sophomore attacker/midfielder Kylie Drexel and Michael all put home three goals during the senior day celebration.
If the Pioneers come away victorious on Friday, they will undoubtedly have revenge on their minds after being embarrassed in their regular season matchup with USC. Despite the loss, Denver finished third in the MPSF with a 7-2 conference record and 12-4 overall record.
Denver boasts a formidable offensive attack that will lead a bid to defend their 2014 MPSF Conference title.
The Pioneers are led by senior attacker and main facilitator Jill Remenapp, who has tallied 56 points on 19 goals and 37 assists this season. Redshirt freshman attacker Nicole Martindale leads the team with 33 goals scored on the year, and senior midfielder Kiki Boone has added 29 goals of her own while winning 52 draw controls.
Should the Women of Troy have to match up with Oregon, they will be facing a 10-7 regular season team with a 4-5 conference record. USC’s two goal victory over the Ducks earlier in the season, however, marked the closest conference game the team has played this season.
The Ducks boast two                  30-plus goal scorers in junior midfielder Carly O’Connell (32) and senior attacker Olivia Pyne (34). Freshman attacker Cambi Cukar has dished 35 assists this season, helping set up her fellow teammates.
O’Connell has also won 51 draw controls and collected 26 ground balls this year.
No matter which team USC will battle with on Saturday, as long as they focus on their own effort first, they are confident in their chances.
“The most important thing is for us to continue to improve on things from our last game against San Diego State,” head coach Lindsay Munday said. “We have the game film from both Oregon and Denver and we’ve been preparing for both, but because we won’t know until Friday, we are planning on taking care of ourselves first and then making the adjustment to whichever team we end up facing later.”
Ready to lead the Women of Troy offensively against either opponent will be team           points-leader in junior attacker Cara de Lyra, who has tallied a 60 points on 32 goals and 28 assists this season.
De Lyra has been instrumental in setting up teammates Michael (46 goals and 11 assists) and Johansen (37 goals and 10 assists), helping the Women of Troy flaunt a very balanced scoring attack.
“I get more hyped up when I get an assist, instead of a goal,” de Lyra said. “I really like to see the other girls on the team scoring and playing really well together. That’s all that matters.”
Defensively, USC will be anchored by a collection of mainstays in junior Courtney Tarleton, sophomore Nina Kelty, and seniors Kaitlyn Couture and Kaila Sommi, among others.
Anchoring the Women of Troy is standout freshman goalie Gussie Johns, who has made 74 saves while holding opponents to a 7.58 goals-against average in a stellar first-year campaign.
Though the pressures of the playoffs may be enough to faze certain teams, the Women of Troy are confident that together as a unit, they will be ready to perform. Their strong team cohesiveness and depth have been season-long calling cards, and are crucial to the team’s success.
“Our team chemistry is really great this year,” Kelty said. “We are really hard to scout because we have so many people coming in and out and scoring and winning draw controls and contributing. It makes us hard to scout because we are so unpredictable.”
The first faceoff for Saturday’s matchup is set for 6 p.m.

As the 2015 Pulitzer Prizes  were announced last week, Rob Kuznia couldn’t bring himself to watch.
“I made a point not to watch the live broadcast on YouTube because I didn’t want to watch myself lose,” Kuznia said.
The journalist turned publicist was nominated for a local reporting prize for his work at the Torrance-based Daily Breeze. No longer in reporting, gaining a win was the last thing he expected.
But he soon got a call from his editor, Frank Suraci, telling him that they had won.
“We were speechless,” he said. “We were just repeating the same thing, which was, ‘I can’t believe this!’ We were pretty inarticulate for a few minutes and then began a day of celebration.”
Kuznia and Suraci, as well as fellow reporter Rebecca Kimitch, were also awarded a Scripps Howard Award for Community Journalism before the Pulitzer. Their investigative series, entitled “Centinela: Manipulation, Intimidation and Corruption,” covered wrongdoing within the school district.
“It wasn’t until we won the Scripps Howard Award that it sort of dawned on me that [the Pulitzer] was a real possibility,” Kuznia said. “It felt like a long shot to me, so I took it as flattery and left it at that.”
The articles covered Superintendent Jose Fernandez’s pay, which was $663,000, as well as other benefits from the district. It led to backlash from the public, a police investigation of Fernandez and his firing. Spending issues throughout the district were also uncovered during the investigation.
“Right away, it created a firestorm,” Kuznia said. “A lot of parents, families and students who are living paycheck-to-paycheck came to [board meetings] to communicate their extreme disappointment that this school district, which was supposed to be looking out for them, was really looking out for themselves.”
Centinela Valley is a small, low-income school district in Los Angeles County. The district’s test scores ranked last of the 80 school districts in the county, Kuznia said.
“This is a very indigent population, and here the leader of the district is making almost $1,000,000 in a single year,” he said. “All the while, the school board is cutting programs that benefitted those students and laying off teachers.”
Before working for the Daily Breeze, Kuznia studied journalism at the University of Minnesota, and later worked for newspapers in Minnesota and in Oregon before moving to California. He began working as a communications staff member for the Shoah Foundation in August 2014 and, for now, plans to stay.
“I’m sort of taking a wait-and-see approach,” Kuznia said. “I’m looking forward to a state of semi-normality again.”

The Los Angeles Community Impact hosted its Spring Showcase, the culmination of the organization’s semester-long consulting projects on Wednesday.
Shauna Nep, director of community and innovation at the Goldhirsh Foundation, discussed what she called the five points along the “circuitous path of innovation”: necessity, hustle, storytelling, unusual suspects and the reflective incubation period. She used examples from both the Goldhirsh Foundation and from her own life for the discussion.
The Los Angeles Community Impact is completely student-run and based out of the Marshall School of Business. The group provides pro bono consulting to nonprofits and small businesses in Los Angeles.
Anna Silk, a junior majoring in public policy, planning and development, is the current president of LACI and oversees all of the projects throughout the semester. She explained that the mission of the organization is to have a long-term positive influence on the Los Angeles community.
“We try to help our clients identify what their biggest challenges are and how we can help during the semester to create recommendations that are going to be really long-lasting and impactful,” Silk said.
The Spring Showcase consisted of student speeches, a keynote address and three project presentations. The projects presented were Soldiers’ Project, Beat the Streets Los Angeles and Med SRG.
Ling Zeng, a sophomore majoring in business administration, was the team leader of Beat the Streets Los Angeles, one of the projects presented. She and her teammates focused their project on developing a metrics system to better track the organization’s progress and communicate that progress to community stakeholders.
“We sat down together with the client and talked about the goals that they wanted to reach and some key challenges they were facing, which led us to developing our project scope. We conducted research throughout the semester — both primary and secondary research, such as talking with similar, sports-based organizations and their participants. After conducting that research we synthesized all of the information and came up with recommendations that we thought best met their goals,” Zeng said.
Marc Pakravan, a freshman majoring in business administration and member of LACI, worked with Community Family Health Council this semester. He described Showcase as being a night when LACI can share exactly what they do with the rest of the USC and Los Angeles community.
“Showcase is our signature end of the year event where a few LACI teams showcase exactly what they’ve been working on all semester. It’s an all-encompassing night about social innovation, problem-solving and teamwork,” he said.
LACI has worked with four of the same organizations as Goldhirsh, including the Downtown Women’s Center and Green Dot Public Schools.
“It’s exciting that [these organizations] are clients that LACI has worked with in the past and helped support and also someone that the Goldhirsh Foundation and Tara have doled out money to because they think that they’re going places,” Silk said.
As the culmination of LACI projects, Showcase is a time when teams can meet with their clients to deliver their final recommendations, called “deliverables.” These final deliverables are composed of all of the research done throughout the semester, recommendations and action steps for implementation, giving the clients something to reference in the future.
The event was open to USC students, faculty, LACI clients and community members. Silk emphasized that Showcase is an opportunity for students to learn more about the organization.
“Sometimes, people are interested in joining LACI but are not sure really what a project would look like or what their experience would look like, and they don’t always understand the breadth of types of students who find that LACI is a good place for their personal and academic growth. Showcase is a good place to find that out, as well as do some networking with some really cool people in the Los Angeles community,” she said.

Nineteen-year-old Andrew Garcia, one of the four defendants charged with the murder of USC graduate student Xinran Ji, returned to court Wednesday after a judge deemed him mentally competent to stand trial.
Deputy District Attorney John McKinney presented footage from a USC surveillance camera that allegedly showed Garcia and his accomplices — Alejandra Guerrero, Alberto Ochoa and Jonathan Del Carmen — chasing Ji, who can be seen wearing light-colored clothing and a black backpack, and beating him with a baseball bat on the night of July 24, 2014.
Los Angeles Police Department Detective Matthew Courtney testified during the preliminary hearing that he believed Garcia is the first person seen chasing Ji in the footage.
“Mr. Garcia’s body type, his hairstyle, his clothing match what I see as the first individual chasing after Mr. Ji,” Courtney said. “Also, I came to that conclusion based on the conversation I had with Mr. Garcia as well as with the other defendants in this case.”
McKinney also showed several graphic photos depicting blood droplets leading from the confrontation near 29th Street and Orchard Avenue to Ji’s apartment where he later died from his injuries. The images also showed the furniture, the bathroom sink and the clothing Ji was wearing inside his apartment were covered in blood.
Garcia pleaded not guilty to murder charges earlier this year, and the hearing will continue tomorrow.
I hope the evidence against these thugs is presented in a compartmentalized manner so the judge will fry them like fish. How can you beat a defenseless and studious kid who was minding his own business.
And the way Xinran Ji died and how he staggered to his home is so heartbreaking. And I hope the jury (when the case goes to the final trial) has those two images seared into the brains and then go ahead and convict Andrew Garcia with first degree murder and whatever appropriate charges they can file and make stick to his accomplices.
I hope all four of the thugs who caused his death, Garcia; Alejandra Guerrero (probably the getaway driver or lookout person and one of the people who stood by and let Ji get bludgeoned to death); Alberto Ochoa (I bet he was one of the persons who hit Ji with the bat); and Jonathan Del Carmen (refer to Ochoa and Garcia) all get convicted of first degree murder because that’s what they deserve.
This is a case of bored and spineless followers who wanted to do something that they thought would make them cool, but instead it could cost them their freedom.

Lindsey Buckingham, the guitarist of the renowned ’70s band Fleetwood Mac, took a break from the band’s tour to speak to a packed crowd in Bovard Auditorium on Wednesday night.
Fleetwood Mac is best known for its Grammy Award-winning album Rumours which was released in 1977.
At USC, however, Fleetwood Mac is best known for having recorded the song “Tusk” alongside the Trojan Marching Band.
The talk was hosted by the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies as part of David Belasco’s class, BAEP 470: The Entrepreneurial Mindset – Taking the Leap.
Upon introducing Buckingham, Belasco remarked that that night was special because it was all about the USC family and the experiences they share.
Taylor DuPont, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said that she attended the event because Fleetwood Mac was an important part of her childhood.
“Fleetwood Mac is my favorite band. I grew up listening to them and continue to do so. When I found out that Lindsey would be on campus, I jumped at the opportunity of seeing him talk and play,” she said.
During the talk, Buckingham discussed his youth, how he met his bandmate and former lover, Stevie Nicks, and how he came to join Fleetwood Mac.
He then discussed the success of Rumours and how it was also a difficult time for the band members because their romantic relationships were disintegrating.
Buckingham said this difficult time affected his career. Belasco asked him whether great art required great pain.
“At the very least, emotional experiences will only broaden your creative landscape,” Buckingham said.
After every topic, Buckingham performed a song related to it. Among them were “Never Going Back Again,” “Bleed to Love Her” and “Big Love.”
For every song that he performed, he received a standing ovation from the audience.
Because of Fleetwood Mac’s unique connection to USC, Buckingham also discussed how Fleetwood Mac came to collaborate with the Trojan Marching Band to play “Tusk.”
“We wanted something that would sound like a jungle roll and hypnotic. How Bartner got in the picture, I don’t know. Maybe Mick?” he said, referring to the band’s drummer.
A video from USC’s archives that showed the day that “Tusk” was recorded at Dodger Stadium was shown. Belasco explained that through “Tusk,” the Trojan Marching Band was able to set two unique records, one for the first collegiate marching band with a Grammy-winning record and one for the most musicians collaborating on one single.
Following the talk, students asked Buckingham questions. He provided them with advice regarding the definition of success.
“I was never really [goal-driven]. I was focused, but not necessarily trying to do anything for anything other than my own success,” Buckingham said.
The talk ended with Buckingham performing “Tusk” and “Go Your Own Way” with the band.
Earlier in the talk, Buckingham said the work of Fleetwood Mac has been able to reach such a wide array of generations.
“We have gotten teenagers whom our body of work seems to make sense to,” Buckingham said.
Students said after the event that they were very pleased with Buckingham’s talk and performance.
Jake Simon, a junior majoring in business administration, said that he felt very fortunate to have been able to attend.
“I was in the second row and it was beyond incredible,” he said.
Cristina Gomez said she was impressed by the uniqueness of the event.
“This was like a personal concert for ourselves along with stories. It was so impressive!” she said.
At the event, the Lloyd Greif Center awarded Buckingham with a trophy that recognized his contributions to the university, as well as his musical entrepreneurship.
Correction: An earlier version of this article quoted Cristina Gúzman. Her name is actually Cristina Gomez. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Next week, the No. 1 women’s and No. 7 men’s tennis teams will host the first and second rounds of the NCAA tournament at Marks Stadium from May 8 through May 10.
With the top spot in the nation, the Women of Troy will look to carry the momentum from their undefeated Pac-12 season (second in three years) and a sweep of the Pac-12 championship.
The last time the Women of Troy held the top seed in the tournament was in 1985 — -the last year they captured the title.  This is their 24th consecutive tournament appearance, and their 33rd overall.
Senior All-Americans Sabrina Santamaria and Zoë Scandalis lead the team, and they’re supported by senior Gabriella DeSimone, junior Giuliana Olmos, sophomore Zoë Katz and freshmen Gabby Smith, Madison Westby and Meredith Xepoleas. Xepoleas was just named USC Credit Union’s Student-Athlete of the Week after sweeping the competition and becoming the fourth consecutive Trojan to win the Pac-12 Invitational Singles title.
As a whole, the Women of Troy are on the right path to make a legitimate run for the crown. They’re a team that’s            victory-savvy, with plenty of knowledge and experience.
Featuring a full set of six nationally-ranked singles and three ranked pairs, the Women of Troy have both the talent and the depth to win their first title in 30 years.
For the men’s team, they’re just as talented and can find an equal amount of success in the tournament. All but two of the players from last year’s championship squad are back and ready to repeat as champions.
The Trojans are appearing in their ninth consecutive NCAA tournament, and 37th overall. Similar to the Women of Troy, the men’s team will be looking to carry the momentum from their Pac-12 Invitational Championship.
This team knows all about winning the national title. Seniors Yannick Hanfmann, Eric Johnson, Roberto Quiroz and Jonny Wang are already proud owners of two rings. Looking for its third, the team will be depending on their leadership and postseason savvy to capture the program’s 22nd national title; they lead the nation with 21 titles overall.
In last year’s title match, current junior Max de Vroome was key to winning the title. Sophomores Rob Bellamy, Nick Crystal and Connor Ferren, and freshmen Thibault Forget, Henry Ji, David Laser and Tanner Smith all provide depth and help to round out the team.
The Trojans also have six nationally-ranked players and are lead by the third-ranked doubles pair of Hanfmann and Quiroz.
The winning teams coming out of the games at USC will advance to the Round of 16, which will be played in Waco, Texas. The remainder of the tournament will be hosted by the Baylor Bears, who also has both their men’s and women’s teams in the tournament.
Overall, both USC teams are used to postseason success. Both are ready to bring the NCAA titles back home to USC.
The Trojans will play first on May 8 against Idaho at 1 p.m. The Women of Troy will kick-off the tournament on May 9 against Youngstown State.
The first round matches are a complete joke. It is like the Romans being fed to the lions. Youngstown St, and Idaho are you serious. The ncaa should start with the top 16 teams and get down to business right away.

Today’s the big day for a number of former Trojans — the highly anticipated 2015 NFL Draft is finally here.
The lifelong dreams of 32 young players will come true tonight in Chicago when they receive a call on their smart phones from a member of a team’s front office — sharing the good news with the draftees that the team would like them to come play for their city.
After their names are called on stage by Commissioner Roger Goodell  and emotional hugs and congratulatory handshakes are exchanged between friends and family, most of the draftees hold up a team hat and jersey, pose for a quick photo-op with the commissioner, and just like that, they’re off into the real world.
This draft is stacked from top to bottom with five-star prospects including USC’s very own Leonard Williams, who is projected to go in the top-five. Other USC alumni including Nelson Agholor, Javorius “Buck” Allen, Josh Shaw and Hayes Pullard may have to wait until days two or three until they hear their names called, but they’ve waited their entire lives for this moment — I’m sure they can wait another day or two.
Pullard took to the Player’s Tribune yesterday in a first person editorial to make his case for why NFL teams should draft him — last ditch effort to move his way up the draft boards.
The NFL Draft surely is a great example of a spectacle with all of the green room drama, tears and anxious faces, but if you want to witness a true display of pageantry, there’s USC commencement, which is right around the corner for those students graduating.
Like at the draft, you can expect to find all kinds of people dressed to the nines in their gowns and sashes, congratulating one another and posing for pictures for, perhaps, one last time in front of Tommy Trojan. Of course, there will also be a few tears here and there, but ones of joy.
At graduation, you will also find an abundance of former college students in their early-to-mid 20’s that are eager, yet nervous to start a new chapter in their lives.
Just like teams that are seeking a player that will boost their franchise to the next level, companies and start-ups are also constantly looking for talented college graduates that are capable of making a difference for their organization.
I have had the privilege of knowing and working with a few of these gifted types of graduating seniors, which I consider to be        five-star prospects, and who will be entering into a different type of draft in a little over two weeks — the real world.
There’s a pair of USC journalism hall-of-famers in particular that I want to salute, though, for teaching me so much over the years.
First and foremost, there’s the one and only Evan Budrovich, otherwise known as the voice of USC athletics. Scouts are also classifying him at a five-star on-air prospect.
Ever since meeting Evan at a USC women’s basketball game when I was still just a little freshman, I knew that he was destined for big things. A winner of the 2013-2014 Chick Hearn Scholarship, Evan has spent the last three seasons calling USC baseball games from Dedeaux Field, where he will always be known for his “Oh that’s just filthy” call.
My sophomore year, Evan took me under his wing and brought me on board to host Trojan Vision’s one-and-only [and best] weekly sports talk show The Water Cooler. We’ve been on air together almost every Friday for just about two years, and I have a feeling there will be a few tears that run down my face when he signs off for the last time tomorrow afternoon.
Over the years, we continually joked about getting his byline in the paper before he graduated and finally did last week with a women’s tennis feature.
I’m definitely going to miss Evan and his witty, pun-filled show run throughs, as he will be taking his talents across the country to North Carolina to begin his career with the Morehead City Marlins.
Furthermore, I would like to toast to former Daily Trojan sports editor Aubrey Kragen, someone who has also had a tremendous impact on my journalism career here at USC.
The first time I met Aubrey actually was at the annual Daily Trojan vs. Daily Bruin basketball game, where we emerged victorious over our rivals in a blowout fashion, and it was surely a sign of good things to come.
We joked about one day becoming co-editors, and she would fulfill half of that proposition when she became sports editor last spring. During that time, she always gave me guidance when I asked for it and transitioned me into my current role, and there’s no way I would be where I am today without her.
I’ll never forget the time we ended up on primetime SportsCenter after photo bombing Coach Sark’s          postgame interview on national TV.
I’m forever grateful to not only Aubrey and Evan, but all of the seniors that taught me something important at some point along the way. I will dearly miss all of you.
Good luck in the real world, and I have no doubt that you will all accomplish extraordinary things.
As for me, luckily for you guys, I’m just a junior and am excited to return in the fall for what is sure to be an unforgettable and exciting season of USC football.
Fight on, and have a great summer.

The No. 1-ranked USC sand volleyball team is looking to complete its quest toward perfection when it heads to Gulf Shores, Alabama, this weekend for the 2015 AVCA Collegiate Sand Volleyball National Championships. After earning the top seed in the field last week, the Women of Troy (24-0) will make their third consecutive appearance in the national championship tournament and seek the program’s first-ever national title.
USC carries a program-record 24-match winning streak into the championships and is the top-seeded team for the second straight year. The eight-team field consists of second-seeded Hawai’i (15-1), third-seeded Florida International (18-1), fourth-seeded Pepperdine (10-4), fifth-seeded Georgia State (18-1), sixth-seeded Florida State (13-4), seventh-seeded Long Beach State (13-4), and USC’s first-round opponent and eighth-seeded Stetson (21-4). Pepperdine returns as the defending national champion and was also the first title winner in 2012, while Long Beach State won the championship in 2013.
The national championship trophy has been elusive for USC, as the Women of Troy have yet to play in the title game, bowing out in the AVCA semifinals two years in a row. Going into last year’s tournament, USC was the No. 1 seed but suffered a 3-2 upset loss in the first round against No. 4-ranked Hawai’i and were forced to play in the losers bracket, where they were handed another close 3-2 loss, this time to No. 2-ranked Pepperdine. Should the Women of Troy make it there this year, however, they will have the opportunity to get revenge on both No. 2-ranked Hawai’i and                     No. 4-ranked Pepperdine during bracket play.
But first, USC must face a familiar foe in the first round of the tournament on Friday, as the No. 1 seed Women of Troy play against the No. 8 seed Stetson for the first match of the day at 8 a.m. CT. USC leads the all-time series 2-0, with the last meeting being a 4-1 win over the Hatters that knocked them out of last year’s AVCA tournament. The then No. 6-ranked Hatters were only able to pull off a win at the three spot, a 21-19, 21-15 decision over USC’s Sam Hirschmann and Natasa Siljkovic. Only one USC pair remains intact from that game, sophomores Nicolette Martin and Allie Wheeler at the four spot. The Hatters recently won the Atlantic Sun Conference and suffered just four dual losses this season. Julie Bassett and Kaley Melville lead Stetson as the top pair and sport a 26-3 overall record together. Furthermore, it will be a familiar sight for USC senior Alexa Stonish, who played her first collegiate sand volleyball season at Stetson in 2012 and produced a 16-14 overall record before transferring to USC.
USC has improved each season under 2014 AVCA National Coach of the Year Anna Collier, going from a 3-1 record in 2012, 23-3 in 2013, 14-3 in 2014, and now a perfect 24-0 in 2015. In her fourth year guiding the Women of Troy, Collier has USC atop the national rankings for the second half of the season.
Of USC’s 24 wins this season, 16 of them have been 5-0 sweeps. Furthermore, before this season, only two USC pairs had ever crossed the 30-win plateau in four years as a program. Now all five Women of Troy pairs could reach that mark this weekend. Two of USC’s starting five pairs have already reached 30 wins on the year, led by the No. 1 pairing of sophomores Sara Hughes and Kelly Claes with an impressive 36-3 record. Senior Eve Ettinger and graduate student Meg Norton  at court three also have 30 wins, combining for a strong 30-5 record. The other three Women of Troy pairs are right on the cusp of reaching 30, as junior Alexa Strange and sophomore Sophie Bukovec at the No. 2 spot have 29 wins, Nicolette Martin and Allie Wheeler are at 28-5 as the No. 4 pairing, and the       senior-freshman duo of Bria Russ and Jenna Belton are 27-4 at court five.
The Women of Troy have also had great success in the Pairs Tournament that takes place during the tournament as well, as USC tandems have won each of the last two pairs titles, with Kirby Burnham  and Stevi Robinson winning in 2013, and Burnham and Hughes winning in 2014. Hughes has the experience going deep into pairs play after capturing the title as a freshman last season, and now she’s looking to defend her pairs crown with Claes on Sunday.
The team championship will be held on May 1-2. Each school fields five doubles teams ranked in order and plays the corresponding pair from an opponent, and the team-versus-team matches are decided by the school that wins three of the five flights. These matchups over the two days culminate with the finals of team play on Saturday, May 2 at 4 p.m. CT.
The pairs’ field includes the top duos from the schools in the team competition as well as 10 teams identified as the “Best of the Rest” from schools not in the team competition. Pairs were selected from Loyola Marymount, Louisiana-Monroe, LSU, Arizona, UAB, Grand Canyon, Tulane, College of Charleston and UCLA. First-round matches in the pairs’ championship will start at 8 a.m. CT on Sunday, May 3, with the championship match later that day slated to begin at 2 p.m. CT.
USC opens the championship tournament against Stetson on Friday, May 1, at 8 a.m. CT (6 a.m. PST).

The No. 8 USC men’s volleyball team (19-8, 15-7 MPSF) will take on No. 2 UC Irvine (26-4, 19-3 MPSF) tonight in a MPSF tournament semifinal match at Irvine.
Earlier this year, the Trojans upset the Anteaters in a grueling five-set match (28-30, 25-17,    21-25, 25-23, 15-13) that propelled them back into the national spotlight.
Against the Anteaters, the Trojans had a stellar offensive performance. Junior opposite hitter Josh Kirchner produced a team-high 15 kills along with three blocks and two aces. Right behind him was redshirt sophomore Christopher Orenic, who had 14 kills.
Senior middle blocker Robert Feathers had an especially great match, with a match-best .647 hitting percentage, 12 kills and a team-high six blocks.
With another successful offensive outing, the Trojans should be able to top the Anteaters in Irvine.
The Trojans will be looking to carry the momentum from their intense five-set home victory over No. 6 BYU (25-17, 20-25, 25-22, 23-25, 15-13) last week.
Junior outside hitter Alex Slaught stood out against BYU, especially in the fifth set.
Responsible for the winning kill, Slaught recorded a team-high 21 kills and was named USC Credit Union’s Student Athlete of the Week for his performance.
While Slaught stood out, everyone had a match to be proud of, said  head coach Bill Ferguson.
“A lot of guys were challenged in subsets of their game,” Ferguson said. “They were able to not let that affect their other parts. That’s really good mental toughness.”
Heading down to Irvine, the Trojans will have to prepare for a couple different components of a very talented Anteater team.
As usual, USC will need to focus on their serving and passing game. Great serving is one of the most crucial aspects to the sport and has the ability to throw off the opponent’s offense. Poor passing also has the capacity to limit a team’s offensive potential.
UCI’s balanced serve and pass game keeps its opponents on their toes.
One of the biggest factors in UCI’s favor is All-American libero Michael Brinkley.
Ferguson referred to him as arguably the “best in the country” at his position.
“He’ll make some unbelievable digs on balls that we hit that will normally go down,” Ferguson said. “We’ll just have to weather that storm.”
Though Brinkley’s digging will bring an added level of difficulty, it’s nothing the Trojans haven’t faced before.
To counteract UCI’s defensive strengths, USC will look to senior setter Micah Christenson to orchestrate a strong offensive performance.
This year’s co-winner of the Lloyd Ball Award as the nation’s top collegiate setter, Christenson is a 2014 All-American and a setter for the U.S. National Team that won the FIVB World League gold medal last year.
“When you get down to brass tacks, Micah is the best setter in our region of the world,” Ferguson said.
With so many accolades, it’s obvious that USC’s offense is in the right hands with Christenson.
Ferguson is not overly concerned about facing the Anteaters on the road. When the two teams met earlier this season in Irvine, there was a significant number of Trojan fans in the crowd.
“It’s in the heart of Trojan mation,” Ferguson said. “It’s a place where we feel comfortable playing.”
Overall, the team seems confident and motivated to dominate the Anteaters.
The Trojans will face UCI at 7:30 p.m. at the Bren Center in Irvine.
 
Interesting in the match the Trojans defeated Irvine, top two hitters were Kirchner and Orenic who don’t play at all recently.
Maybe both injured who knows, didn’t appear in the BYU match. That is the problem with the coaching staff. Players are
not getting better at the season’s end when it really counts especially freshmen. One exception has been Larry Tuiletta who
seems more comfortable although he was the national player of the year in high school per Gatorade. Inlow, Wyett, and
Rivera nowhere to be seen.

School is quickly coming to a close, and once the stress of getting through finals is over, summer break will be in full bloom. To help build the greatest summer plan, here’s a few road trip suggestions to catch the most beautiful West Coast sights.
Yosemite National Park, California
Just 285 miles north of campus, this five-hour drive is well worth the trek the moment one steps foot into the beautiful landscape of Yosemite. Every overlook in this national park looks like a grand painting that feels unreal to stand before. There’s such an abundance of activities to do in Yosemite that it’s not recommended to stay in for less than a weekend. Infinite camping spots, waterfalls, hikes and meadows fill the spaces between the woods. A group of college students will find themselves marveling at this park’s magnificent views for their entire visit. Mirror Lake is an especially popular spot and definitely a must-see to check off anyone’s explore list. The trailhead to the lake is well-marked on the far east side of Yosemite Valley and is the closest a hiker can get to the base of Half Dome. Another worthwhile experience is conquering Taft Point at sunset. With an overlook of El Capitan and the vast valley of the entire park, the view from the peak is mind-blowingly beautiful. Bring a flashlight and stay a little after dark to experience a symphony of stars above in absolute solitude.
Zion National Park, Utah
This landscape for the adventurous hosts some of the most iconic and gorgeous scenery one can experience in the West. Utah has riveting geological formations, painted with rich sandstone colors and rivers that are undeniably photogenic. The best activity to experience in the summertime is swimming through the Virgin River, better known as the Narrows. Take a swim through 2,000-foot canyon walls that are only 30 feet apart from each other. For the more laid-back adventurer, hiking the Overlook Trail is an easier option, but with a great reward. This short hike ends at the edge of a cliff with a magnificent view of lower Zion Canyon, including Zion’s famous Switchbacks, the Beehives, West Temple, East Temple, Towers of the Virgin and the Streaked Wall.
Bryce National Park, Utah
Bryce entertains travelers with many scenic views, as each point on the map of this national park is a destination stopping point. There are four sites that are highly recommended: Inspiration Point, Swamp Canyon Loop, Farview Point and Natural Bridge.
At Inspiration Point, all who look out from this point are bound to be inspired. The intricacies of the hoodoos and their formation through the erosion of the Claron Formation are simply beautiful. You get the most spectacular perspective of the main amphitheater in Bryce Canyon here, too. Swamp Canyon appears relatively small and sheltered from the overlook, bounded on both sides by fins and hoodoos, hence why you’ll get a closer and more intimate connection with Bryce’s canyon.
From Farview Point, travelers can look out over parts of Bryce Canyon and famous features in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. From north to south, the Aquarius Plateau (Pink Cliffs), the Kaiparowits Plateau (Grey Cliffs), Molly’s Nipple (White Cliffs) and parts of the Kaibab Plateau are visible. On most days, Navajo Mountain can also be easily seen. The structure called Natural Bridge, though it’s not an actual bridge, is one of several natural arches found in Bryce Canyon. This arch is particularly photogenic in Bryce: it has been sculpted from some of the reddest rock of the Claron Formation that is rich in iron oxide minerals and has a beautiful contrast to the dark green of the Ponderosa forest that peeks through the arch from the canyon below.
Crater Lake, Oregon
As the deepest lake in the United States and seventh deepest in the world, Crater Lake National Park is a view no photo could ever do justice. Formed from the collapse of volcano Mount Mazama, a lake now stands stretching six miles. Crater Lake has a number of entrances that are each only open depending on the season. Check which entrance is open before visiting and save a lot of time traveling around the circumference of the park to get inside. Surrounded by cliffs, the lake is about 2,000 feet high and has the clearest blue water on the West Coast. The centerpiece of the lake is a small island off to one of the edges that is surrounded by a heavy mantle of trees. Swimming in the lake is only allowed in the last half of June and only through the Cleetwood Cove Trail, the only point around the lake where it is safest to jump in the water. The trail is about a mile long and drops 700 feet down to the lake shore.

Our daily paper may be ending as the school year comes to a close (don’t worry, we’ll still have weekly issues this summer), but that doesn’t mean you’ll be out of the loop. We’ve compiled the best summer films to watch out for in the coming months, blockbuster or otherwise.
Maggie, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Abigail Breslin, is about one father’s struggle to save his daughter as she falls victim to the zombie apocalypse. This film proves to be a change in tone for Schwarzenegger. It’s darker, grittier and just a bit more rooted in reality (we’re talking about the father-daughter aspect here, not the savage zombie plague). It’s also a nice change for Breslin, whose last zombie flick was Zombieland — not the most dramatic of releases. The film will be in theaters May 8.
Slow West, starring Michael Fassbender and Kodi Smit-McPhee, comes recommended from lifestyle editor Daniel Gryzwacz. If you’re in the mood for a western — and even if you’re not, because hey, westerns don’t come around that often anymore — Slow West is the flick to choose. Already coming in with a “Certified Fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes, Slow West comes out May 15.
Tomorrowland, written by Prometheus and World War Z scribe Damon Lindelof and directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol), stars none other than George Clooney and Britt Robertson (that one girl from Under the Dome and Dan in Real Life). Tomorrowland’s inspiration came simply from the oddly named themed area included in Disney parks around the globe. Hopefully more than just a marketing gimmick, albeit a $190 million one, we’re expecting Tomorrowland to excite and explore new mythology that hopefully adds a bit more to the themed area than simply being inspired by the future. The film opens May 22.
San Andreas is your pick if you didn’t get quite enough of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson in Furious 7 and you’re looking for some more fast action and cheap (yet expensive) thrills. It’s also perfect if you, like so many other SoCal residents, can’t stop obsessing about when The Big One will hit Los Angeles. San Andreas has taken Angelenos’ fears to the extreme and already shown the absolute devastation that could possibly hit when the trailer debuted last month. The movie hits theaters May 29.
Love & Mercy, in theaters June 5, stars John Cusack and Paul Dano in a dual role as the Beach Boys’s famed Bryan Wilson. The film is billed as more than just a biopic and features a strong supporting cast including Paul Giamatti and Elizabeth Banks. The dual casting provides a fresh change from normal biopic fare and creates a non-linear flashback storyline that promises to be interesting. Dano has already proved he has the chops for a dramatic and believable role, but it’s been a while since Cusack has gotten back on the horse of a successful film. Recommended for music and Beach Boys fans.
Me & Earl & the Dying Girl almost completely stars unknown actors, but that didn’t stop it from winning both the Jury Prize and Audience Award at Sundance this year. It centers on a group of high schoolers who embark on a filmmaking exercise as one of them battles leukemia — it’s already clear this film will be the tearjerker of the summer. Hopefully less campy than The Fault in Our Stars, Me & Earl & the Dying Girl opens June 12.
Dope was an indie festival darling this past season at Cannes and the subject of an intense bidding war from six production companies before finally being sold to Open Road Films. The story is billed as a “coming-of-age story for the post hip-hop generation” and features a mostly unknown cast, except for a few heavy hitters like A$AP Rocky and Tyga. Also in the cast are supermodel Chanel Iman and the kid from Grand Budapest Hotel, Tony Revolori. The film’s release date is June 19.
The Diary of a Teenage Girl, another indie festival star, features Kristin Wiig as a mother in 1970s San Francisco. But the movie isn’t about her — it’s about her daughter Minnie (Bel Powley), who embarks on a coming-of-age experience when she starts to date her mother’s boyfriend. The film is already getting acclaim for its frank discussions and depictions of underage sex, as well as its cartoon-like aspects (the film was based on a graphic novel). The film is also billed as a breakout for first-time director Marielle Heller, and will be in theaters Aug. 7.

Staying in Los Angeles this summer? Looking for something to do besides visiting the Santa Monica Pier and hiking to the Hollywood sign?
Have no fear — I’ve spent the semester thoroughly researching obscure places in Los Angeles, many more places than I could actually fit within one semester of columns. So, for your convenience, I’ve compiled a few of my favorites into this handy list.
I like to think that I could be the official spokesperson for the City of Los Angeles Tourist Bureau. Or technically, the Non-Tourist Bureau. Not anti-tourist, because it’s entertaining to watch out-of-town families fumble with selfie sticks while wearing matching shirts, but non-tourist activities that you wouldn’t find while looking up the city’s most popular attractions.
So, without further ado, here’s your summer itinerary. Make me proud, kids; go outside your comfort zone (A.K.A. off-campus) and explore some of Los Angeles’ hidden gems.
The Metro: O.K., so maybe the Metro isn’t a “hidden gem.” Sue me. But for some Angelenos, it almost seems to be, in spite of the Metro’s cost-effectiveness. Why pay a chunk of money on Uber when you can make the same trip for $1.75 on the rail line? Before summer starts, familiarize yourself with rail lines, and learn to say no to the Uber. You’d be surprised; I promise it’s not as bad as its reputation.
Farmacia y Botanica Million Dollar: Forget CVS or Rite Aid, Farmacia y Botanica Million Dollar takes care of all of your pharmacy needs. The store includes potions, incense and even a tarot card reader. Potions range from “Buen Suerte,” for good luck, to “alejate ley,” or “law stay away.” Voodoo dolls and other oddities stock the shelves, right alongside feminine hygiene products and tissue paper.  The Farmacia y Botanica Million Dollar is located near Pershing Square.
Time Travel Mart:  Located in the Echo Park neighborhood just north of Downtown, the Time Travel Mart allows you to pretend to be Marty McFly without ever getting into a Delorean. The store’s marquee reads, “Whenever you are, we’re already then,” and the items range from futuristic (robot toupees) to prehistoric (barbarian repellent). Additionally, the profits from your time traveling purchase go to a good cause — the store is a charity for 826LA, which tutors local kids in creative writing. If you need another reason to go, Echo Park is my favorite neighborhood, with used bookstores, vintage clothing shops and hipsters galore.
Mortified Los Angeles: I have a rule not to recommend a place to readers unless I’ve actually been there. This is the one exception to that rule, however. “Mortified” is a live show in which people stand in front of an audience and read their childhood diaries, letters and other items outloud, while recalling their most mortifying moments. Unfortunately, you must be 21 or over to attend shows, and I am too much of a goody-goody to own a fake I.D. For those of you old enough to attend, I had to include this on the list so that I can live vicariously through you. The next show is on May 20 in Hollywood; tickets are available through their site at getmortified.com.
Electric Dusk: Electric Dusk drive-in is undoubtedly the best place to watch movies in Los Angeles. Located just 10 minutes from campus, the drive-in is in what appears to be an abandoned warehouse district. Tickets are available both to sit on the lawn or in your car, both around $10. Not only does Electric Dusk show films in the mostly forgotten drive-in format, the films it screens also touch on nostalgia. The Princess Bride, E.T., and Indiana Jones are all scheduled to play this summer, so watch the movies of your childhood the same way your parents watched movies during their childhood.
Sunken City: As I’ve said before, I don’t officially condone trespassing. If I did, however, I’d highly recommend visiting Sunken City, in San Pedro. Sunken City is the apocalyptic remains of several cliffside homes, which slid down to the ocean after a landslide several decades ago. Today, like most other urban ruins, Sunken City is a graffiti artists’ paradise. Ruins of roads and concrete slabs from homes are covered in graffiti, making for an interesting hike. Be prepared to work for the sight, however, the path down to the ruins is steep and slipper. And be warned — the area is gated, and kids, trespassing is illegal.
Abandoned Zoo: Most Angelenos have visited Griffith Park, either for the Observatory, the Hollywood sign hike, or the Los Angeles Zoo. Most haven’t visited the other Los Angeles Zoo, however, the old one which was abandoned in 1965. The zoo’s structures were built back in 1912, but were abandoned upon completion of the new zoo. Instead of removing old cages and habitats, the city left them standing, resulting in a ghostly zoo missing its animals. If you’re as much of a kid as I am, you’ll have fun playing in the cages as if you were one of the animals on display — and if you think that’s weird, then just stand outside the cages and look at them, I guess. But that’s not even half as fun.
Malibu Creek Rock Ponds:  “Don’t cliff jump, its so dangerous!” could be my mother’s catchphrase. She reminds me of the dangers of cliff jumping every time I am anywhere near a body of water, but I can’t help doing it anyways (sorry, Mom). About an hour’s drive from campus, Malibu Creek State Park offers rock ponds that appear to be made for cliff jumping: the rocks around the main pond are easy to scramble up, and the water usually isn’t too dirty (note: usually). The ponds are just a mile hike from the park’s main parking lot. I must offer two disclaimers, however. First, in all seriousness, cliff jumping can be dangerous so use good judgement. Second, I haven’t been to the ponds in over a year, before the drought reached full force, making bodies of water a rarity, so the ponds could be dry.
If you’re staying in Los Angeles this summer, use this column as your bucket list, adding new locations as you discover them. If not, then cut out the article and save it for next semester or bookmark it on your computer, since that’s probably how you’re actually reading it. Whether you use these ideas or find your own, please use this list as inspiration to go outside and appreciate the hidden nooks and crannies of Los Angeles.

Even before the interview starts, it is clear why North of Nine have already begun their musical ascent. Lead singer Jackson Guthy and keyboardist Nolan Frank introduce themselves and proceed to tease each other like brothers with a playfulness that alludes to their dynamic personalities. As the interview begins, they take turns answering the questions with an enthusiasm and introspective mentality that shows how truly dedicated they are to their craft.
Do you ever listen to your own music recreationally?
Jackson: I mean, I do a lot of the time. Only because I think it’s good to keep — it’s like muscle memory. If you keep working out a certain muscle, it’s gonna constantly get better and better with that workout. I think it’s the same thing with me as a singer. It’s better to always learn what you’re going to be doing, and what you’re going to be doing in shows, and kind of find the ways you can make it different live and better than what you’ve already done. I’m not saying I listen to it all the time, but I think it is helpful to get a sense of what you can do differently to make it a new experience.
Nolan: Yeah, I totally feel that. Jack will come up to me all the time and be like, ‘Yo, I was listening to this song the other day and check out this melody. I totally wish we could have gone back and recorded the melody this way.’ So I think it’s like, you keep listening and keep the record version in your head so you can keep track with what works best live and with the crowd and kind of grow as the song goes on.
What’s your biggest goal for your music career?
Jackson: I think all of our biggest goal would be really creating a career with longevity and not going from zero to 100 real quick. But we’re kind of trying to create the best music, the best product — we’re five young guys and we all have come together to make this music, and we just wanna make the music that we love to play and hopefully have it be a voice to people who feel the same way … I think the music will evolve with us. The overall plan is to just get better as musicians and be able to be 70 years old and playing North of Nine music.
Nolan, what drew you to USC?
Nolan: USC is a fantastic school, but I came because the popular music program was like nothing I’d ever heard of. It sounded like the opportunity to do the kind of music I’m traveling around playing with the band right now. There wasn’t really any college program among large universities like the pop program … for me, I went out and visited, met the [vice] dean Chris Sampson and just fell in love with the program. And that’s pretty much 100 percent of the reason I came out.
 
How has your major here at USC helped you in your musical career?
Nolan: Oh, I mean, how has it not would be a better question. Basically, I grew up doing a lot of different things musically. I sang in a bunch of choirs, I played the piano and the trumpet, taking a bunch of different lessons in a bunch of different things, and I was kind of confused — I think a lot of people feel like this when they go to college. ‘Man, I like so many things and have a wide skill set, how am I going to choose one?’ I didn’t want to be a jack of all trades and a master of none. The pop program for me basically took us and said, ‘No, if you’re going to succeed, you need every one of those individual abilities that you have and work on all of those ones you don’t have.’ It puts you in the position to diversify. I think today, as a musician, that’s the best way to be.
What can we expect from North of Nine this summer and in the future?
Jackson: I think we’re really looking forward to finishing up the Long Play album and getting in to go again and developing our sound even more. We’ve been really lucky to go around and travel the country and going to radio stations all around, working our music and getting those connections. I think the goal is to get a real library of songs that we love to play. Hopefully, we’ll join in on a few tours. We have a few really great options in the works right now that we’re looking forward to announcing soon. Making the music and being in the studio is one thing, but the way you can get on stage and create an impact, I think that’s the magic of music … We’re really looking forward to showing people what we’re capable of musically and taking every opportunity big or small and giving it our absolute all, because at the end of the day, you’re only as good as your last song.

Joss Whedon’s The Avengers assembled Earth’s mightiest heroes and sent them off on an epic adventure distinguished by whip-smart dialogue, loving characterizations and more than a few moments of armrest-gripping awe. The director’s deliriously anticipated follow-up, Avengers: Age of Ultron, boasts a larger cast (at least nine featured superheroes), a steeper budget and even grander thematic ambitions, but it can’t quite rekindle the spark of fun and ingenuity that made its predecessor such a resounding triumph of pop cinema.
The film opens on an exhilarating high note as Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) fight their way into the mountain fortress of HYDRA boss Baron Wolfgang von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann), a Teutonic tyrant who’s been performing grotesque experiments on young meta-humans. This sequence comes closest to capturing the whiz-bang joy of the source material, and the team’s mid-battle banter, most of it stemming from Cap’s discomfort with curse words, is infectious. That lighthearted spirit quickly subsides, however, once the team breaches the castle walls and encounters Strucker’s prized pupils, the telekinetic seer Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and her brother, the super-speedy Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson).
Haunted by a Witch-induced hallucination of his friends being slaughtered by an unstoppable foe from beyond the stars, Tony Stark redoubles his efforts to create a form of artificial intelligence that will act as an unmanned global-defense system, a “suit of armor around the world.” Later, during a swanky, cameo-laden party at Avengers Tower, the prototype of this system, codenamed Ultron (James Spader), achieves sentience and embarks on a campaign of world domination in a twisted bid to fulfill his prime directive: saving humanity from itself. Horrified by what he’s unleashed, everyone’s favorite genius billionaire playboy philanthropist vows to bring down the mechanical menace, even as his teammates, including an unusually combative Cap, berate him for his recklessness.
It’s clear that Whedon, who also wrote the screenplay, intended to put our heroes through the emotional wringer this time — the plot reads like a amalgamation of The Empire Strikes Back (there’s even a city in the clouds) and Frankenstein — but his attempts to provide depth and complexity are continually hamstrung by Marvel’s corporate mandates regarding obligatory third act showdowns — the climax is a carbon copy of the first movie’s “Battle of New York” with Ultron drones replacing Chitauri invaders — and the studio’s obsession with setting up future installments, even when it comes at the expense of in-the-moment drama.
Then there’s the matter of Ultron himself. With the exception of Tom Hiddleston’s ruthless but perversely sympathetic Loki and Vincent D’Onofrio’s soft-spoken psycho Kingpin, Marvel has struggled to create memorable onscreen heavies, but Spader, acting through motion-capture, imbues the raving robot with just the right mix of charm — he is Stark’s prodigal son, after all — and unhinged fanaticism. The quality of his performance is offset, however, by the fact that Ultron spends the majority of the film on the run, ducking and covering when he should be destroying, conquering and generally living up to the promise of the movie’s title. He also turns to outright villainy far too quickly, so his beef with his creator lacks any kind of tragic weight. Those of you hoping for scenes with a newly activated, child-like Ultron compulsively watching Disney’s Pinocchio will be sorely disappointed, though he does sing “I’ve Got No Strings” like it’s going out of style.
Despite the flaws, there’s still plenty to enjoy here. Whedon actually manages the difficult task of juggling dozens of characters and plot points in a manner that seems not only coherent but downright inspired at times, even though the audience can sense his exhaustion every step of the way.
The interpersonal drama is still the highlight, often to the point where even the most breathtaking action scene — that would be Iron Man taking on a mind-controlled Hulk in his fan-favorite Hulkbuster armor — feels disruptive. Cap and Iron Man are already on the ideological collision course that will one day lead them to Civil War. Thor’s booming arrogance has never been funnier. The Hulk’s budding romance with Black Widow is sweet without being cloying. Even Hawkeye, who was sidelined for much of the first movie as Loki’s brainwashed stooge, gets some much-needed attention this time around.
Taylor-Johnson’s sadly one-note Quicksilver can’t help but pale in comparison to Evan Peters’ exuberant take on the character in last summer’s X-Men: Days of Future Past, but Olsen’s Scarlet Witch is a truly intriguing addition: a sorrow-scarred war orphan brimming with righteous anger and a bottomless wellspring of psychic energy. It’s a good bet we’ll be seeing much more of her in the Russo brothers’ upcoming Infinity War saga.
Speaking of intriguing additions, let’s take a moment to discuss The Vision (Paul Bettany), the Technicolor android whose sudden appearance in the third act represents the very best and worst of Whedon’s creative instincts. The exact circumstances of his “birth” are deep in spoiler territory, so suffice it to say that The Vision is essentially Ultron as he should have been, a selfless global protector meant to embody the ideals of compassion and serenity. His initial interactions with the Avengers and his later conversations with Ultron are arguably the most well-written scenes in any Marvel film so far, weighing the promise of humanity against its capacity for cruelty, but he remains strangely underutilized for the majority of the final battle, a fact that cheapens the power of his parting monologue. Hopefully the rumored 160-minute director’s cut will redress this issue.
If Avengers: Age of Ultron ends up being Whedon’s final time behind the camera of a major Marvel property, it won’t be for a lack of effort. These movies tend to take a toll on their makers, and the writer-director has recently indicated that he wants to start working on original projects again, far from the world of brand expansion and studio notes. Creative exhaustion is a tricky thing to measure, but this film feels perilously close to the tipping point. Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy both proved there’s still plenty of gas left in Marvel’s tank. It’s simply time for someone new to take the wheel.

If you’re already having withdrawals after experiencing the Do Lab stage at Coachella this year, fear not, this power house production team is feverishly preparing for their annual festival, Lightning in a Bottle, coming this May.
Lightning in a Bottle focuses on music, art, spirituality, all while being the most eco-friendly festival in America. The five-day camping festival has been well-renowned for its impressive lineup and outdoor, engaging festivities and this year has exceeded all previous expectations. With a lineup headlining artists such as SBTRKT, Odesza, Tycho, RL Grime and Australian sensation, Flume, LiB has attracted a diverse audience from around the world and welcomes over 15,000 attendees.
The festival’s location is approximately a 4 hour drive north of university campus, but well worth the trek. The lineup encompasses a wide range of genres within electronic music including trap, indie, ambient, and house. Music enthusiasts are pleased to see featured house producers including Âme, UK Pioneer John Digweed,  Shiba San, SNBRN, Bakermat, and of course everyone’s favorite tropical house Aussie, Thomas Jack. Active Child, Polica, Les Sins, and Made in Heights are just several of the talented Indie performers taking the stage this year.  Heavy Bass fans will be excited to see performances from Griz,  the Opiuo Band, G Jones,  Zion I, and KOAN Sound. AlunaGeorge, whos name is also nestled amongst the headliners will certainly dazzle attendants with their electro-pop and R&B-infused melodious tunes. Festival goers should also expect performances from returning mainstays such as The Lucent Dossier Experience, Random Rab, and The Human Experience.
Aside from the always incredible lineup, Lightning in a Bottle is also known for its mesmerizing, hand-crafted stages and large, aesthetic art structures scattered throughout the venue. Producer Grant Kwiecinski, better known by his stage name, Griz, had positive comments to share with the Daily Trojan, “it’s a very conscious festival that has a great production. Their layout is very creative, with stages like treehouses covered in LED’s and bamboo stages, their design overall is fantastic; they cultivate such great vibes. Lightning in a Bottle is very one of a kind.” The Lucent Temple of Consciousness, The Villiage, and The Learning Kitchen are all sanctuaries located within the festival focused on promoting individualism and educational growth. Along with listening to speeches from motivational speakers and musicians, attendants will have the opportunity to participate in yoga classes, cooking lessons offered by The Learning Kitchen, and many more recreational workshops.
This year, expect to see multiple improvements in the construction of the festival. Some which include larger-scale shade structures that will be built over the main festival grounds and stages. Last year, dust was also a major issue; this year they plan to take as many precautions as possible, providing coverage against dust storms to protect attendants. The original layout has been redesigned for less strenuous walking routes and shorter distances between each stage and attraction, making it convenient to travel around the festival grounds. LiB spotlights the importance of being environmentally conscious and reducing carbon footprints by encouraging a composting and recycling infrastructure, utilizing alternate renewable energy sources, healthy food venders, and free water stations. LiB also offers a Lightning Bus at special pick up locations around California, some being Los Angeles and San Diego. Festival goers get picked up and taken to the festival with an expedited entry, as well as a service to take passengers back home after the weekend festivities end.
Lightning in a bottle isn’t just about music, it’s about spiritual development, cultural immersion, and environmental conservation as well. It provides a welcoming and inspiring environment where communities can bond over music, art, and creativity. The festival encourages freedom of self-expression while simultaneously creating a musical paradise and cultural safe haven for all ages to enjoy.

Earlier this month, USC Students for Life displayed multiple banners featuring jumbo-sized photos of pregnant women and fetuses. On Trousdale Parkway lamp posts, the banners presented quotes praising “life” and facts about fetal development. This display from USC Students for Life was a propaganda dream. With official banners lining the university’s main causeway, not only was the message getting out, but it appeared to be a USC-sponsored cause.
Just a few hours after they were put up, the banners were taken down, but not before they were seen by hundreds of students on their way to and from morning classes. Allowing this display on campus, even for a brief period of time, was damaging, and the university must ensure that the mistake that allowed propaganda of this nature will not happen again.
After the removal of these posters, USC Students for Life argued that the university suppressed the group’s free speech. They are incorrect. USC Students for Life are permitted to spread their anti-abortion message literally anywhere else on campus. This is not systematic discrimination against them; it was just deemed inappropriate that a highly contentious issue was broadcast in an official manner in a location that usually features USC spirit banners.
Of course, the burning question that lingers in the minds of the pro-life students who organized this campaign is not really why their free speech was limited. It is actually more about why the banners were  not deemed inappropriate in the first place.
Three-foot high banners with photos of fetuses, quotes implying that these fetuses are beautiful and special, and factoids that try to humanize a developing fetus are all emotionally manipulative ploys to guilt women into having children that they might not be emotionally, physically or financially ready for — and that they may not want.
The banners preach views entrenched in a narrow religious ideology and negate the idea that a woman’s mental, physical and financial health has value by asserting that giving birth is the most beautiful thing a woman can do.
None of the factoids expressed the variety of physical dangers involved with giving birth, including maternal death. These banners do not tell women that up to 80 percent of new mothers experience mood swings or feelings of depression after childbirth. They do not mention that 10 to 20 percent of new mothers experience postpartum depression. There is no mention of birth-related post-traumatic stress disorder or postpartum psychosis, or the less dramatic, but equally important consideration of the financial struggle related to raising children.
The decision to have a child is arguably the most important decision a woman will ever have to make. This decision is even harder when the woman is a college student who might desire a child but lacks the resources to care for it. These decisions should not be influenced by a selection of intimidating images.
Though activist students made sure that the offensive material was taken down in little time, spreading a message that potentially isolates and demonizes students who choose to make difficult decisions about their own lives and bodies is inexcusable.
Trojan Events and Services needs to be more careful in its process of approving installations to ensure that no political ideology appears to be endorsed by the university ever again.
What a complete crock of sh$t this is! Sarah Green you are an example of the profound intolerance of the left. You cite “mood swings” and “financial health” as legitimate reasons for taking the life of one’s own child! You state that pro-lifers tried to “humanize” a human fetus…what do you think it is if not human? What the hell is the value of a USC education if it turns out bigoted nutcases like you? You are a prime example of the fascist groupthink that has turned the Democratic party into something unrecognizable from its original ideology. If you want to exercise control over your body you need to start way before you get pregnant. Try using birth control or just saying no. I realize the latter option may not be acceptable to someone who thinks that every hedonistic pleasure is her absolute constitutional right. One right you don’t have is the right to censor those whose beliefs are different from yours.
Typical liberal mindset.  Deny the right for others to express opposing opinions.
Liberals:  Today’s thought police.  Dictating to us what is right or wrong.  The very definition of illiberal!
Pro-Life views are not “views entrenched in a narrow religious ideology.” The entire debate surrounding abortion is one that is based on ethics. Both sides, for and against, come to their conclusions based on ethical ideas about when, as a society, we decide if the rights of a mother or the rights of a child are more important. To belittle the issue as just some Jesus freaks ranting and raving on campus, the author is showing a deep, deep misunderstanding of not only the pro-life movement’s platform but also the fundamental questions at the heart of the abortion debate. 
One of my GEs as USC (I think moral and social issues?) would probably be a good course selection for the author. The fact the author even brought up postpartum depression rates as a rational argument for abortion rights is bizarre and troubling. For a school of USC’s caliber, there has to be someone more qualified to write about the complexities of social justice issues on the DT staff.
Good one DT, but please leave the satires to The Onion and Duffel Blog…also apparently Alexander Starovoitov, a MP in the Russian Assembly, recently called for the government to protest Apple’s “gay propaganda” to Russian youths, pointing to the free U2 albums for download. You should be more careful with the word propaganda. It makes you sound like an angsty teen. Or a Fox News anchor arguing climate change.
“… it was just deemed inappropriate that a highly contentious issue was broadcast in an official manner in a location that usually features USC spirit banners.”
Funny, that didn’t seem to be a problem with those rainbow flag banners they put up in the exact same location.
“None of the factoids expressed the variety of physical dangers involved with giving birth…”
Let’s stick with the same-sex marriage comparison. Would you demand that messages supporting same-sex marriage acknowledge statistics about the rates of things like HIV/AIDS, abuse, and infidelity among same-sex couples? Such statistics are about as relevant to the same-sex marriage debate as statistics on post-partum depression and the financial requirements of having a child are to the abortion debate, which is to say not very.
Bottom line is that facts, as John Adams said, are stubborn things. They don’t change. But different facts can be used in different ways to support different sides of the same issue. Citing facts that support your argument isn’t “propaganda,” it’s called making your case. And images of fetuses with factoids about fetal development aren’t any more “emotionally manipulative” than, say, a warm and fuzzy image of a same-sex family or a terrifying image of a lifelong smoker with a stoma.
It’s bad enough that you conveniently glossed over the real issue of university administrators seemingly picking and choosing which “contentious issues” (and, more importantly, which sides of these contentious issues) get to have a banner on campus. But your insistence on twisting something that was clearly meant to be a positive presentation of the pro-life argument into something that “emotionally manipulates” and “demonizes” is what really bothers me. If the banners had depicted, say, gruesome images of aborted fetuses, I’d be inclined to agree with you. But you’re this pissed off at pictures of healthy unborn children? I’m ashamed to call you a fellow Trojan.
This is one of the most baseless articles I have ever read on the DT. What does maternal health have anything to do with the banners?  And, with your logic that nothing that promotes a propaganda shouldn’t be put up means that the LGBTQ Center should also not be allowed to post up their annual rainbow banners also. Finally, there was/is nothing damaging to the school about having banners like this up. This is a school with students from every cultural and moral background. This is a school that supports discussion and dialogue. You just want this school to be another Berkeley where no side other than the extreme liberal one is heard.
First, the banners did not damage the university image at all. Second, the banners were not officially endorsed. Third, having a different opinion than the author of this article (pro-life vs pro-choice) does not make their banners propaganda. Stop victimizing the pro-life group just because they view it differently and just because a poster does not mention maternal health, does not mean the pro-life group does not consider that concern when they decide to be pro-life. You simplified a complex argument with strong points on both sides down to a simple black and white verdict, which is completely inaccurate and baseless. There is nothing wrong with choosing pro-life or pro-choice. I am pro-life and that is a personal decision of mine.

On April 1, Gov. Jerry Brown announced California’s first-ever mandatory water restrictions and instructed cities and towns in the state to cut their water use by 25 percent. This announcement has come on the heels of historically low snowpacks and persisting severe drought conditions that are threatening the state’s already strained water supply. The current drought is now in its third year and shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.
But even as cities and towns are being forced to cut back, corporate giant Nestlé has continued to extract millions of gallons of our state’s water each year and ship much of it to the rest of the country as bottled water. Most egregiously, it was recently discovered that Nestlé has been illegally drawing tens of millions of gallons of water each year from the San Bernardino National Forest, even though their permit to do so expired in 1988. In addition, the company has been accused of drawing up to 80 million gallons of water per year from Sacramento aquifers while residents have been under severe water restrictions. It is clear that this behavior is incompatible with our state’s current drought and need to preserve essential water supplies.
After speaking with disgruntled Nestlé truck drivers, Students Coalition Against Labor Exploitation learned that even as Nestlé has made billions undermining California’s already scarce water supplies, it has also subjected these drivers to unsafe and unfair working conditions. These workers work 12-hour days lifting more than 10,000 gallons of water in the course of each day. This results in numerous bodily injuries, especially imposing harm on their backs. If these injured workers cannot return to work within 90 days, they will lose their routes and have to start over. Despite this, the drivers do not make enough money, and many will therefore work upwards of 70 hours a week to provide for themselves and their families.
SCALE was also disappointed to learn that USC has a substantial contract with Nestlé for water cooler jugs. USC orders so many of these that there is an entire truck dedicated exclusively to regularly bringing these jugs to our campus. Given Nestlé’s business practices and USC’s sustainability commitment to “…maintain an aggressive water conservation program,” a diverse and growing coalition of students and student groups are coming together to call on USC administration to challenge Nestlé to conduct their business in a way that aligns with our school’s commitments to sustainability and fair practices. We recently delivered a letter signed by these groups to the office of the chief financial officer, Robert Abeles, and are awaiting his response by May 1. Mr. Abeles was not available to personally receive our letter.
By continuing to financially support Nestlé without challenging these water and labor practices, USC is tacitly condoning them and contributing to reduced access to water in our community and the mistreatment of workers just trying to make a living. Join us in calling on USC to communicate our concerns to Nestlé and ask our university and Nestlé to uphold commitments to sustainability and the community.

The Daily Trojan Is Correct; Time 4 Nestle To Pay-Up!
Nestle forced my family out of a lucrative business in the late seventies dealing with one of their subsidiaries. Eventually they
ruined it having to shut down entirely. They have avoided major tax liabilities using their location in Switzerland for many years.
Hopefully the U.S. government will sanction them heavily with fines and restrictions in the water use.
Funny considering that all those bottles of water are drunk by us humans.  Can’t think of the last time I opened a bottle of water to wash down my driveway.
Seriously, I cannot understand why Nestle’s water operations has become such a political button.  What about Coke’s water business?  It’s all a bit crazy for me.
But what will happen to the free Nestle milk on campus? (which is probably free sugar bottle to be more accurate lol)

On April 25, a 7.8-magnitude earthquake rocked the small, mountainous country of Nepal. The death toll so far has topped 5,000 and is expected to rise. A poor country with very little infrastructure, Nepal has a long road ahead to rebuild. Not even 10 years have passed since the end of its civil war, and an unstable political environment compounded with the lack of resources means that Nepal will need the help of the international community to overcome this steep obstacle.
In 2006, Nepal’s decade-long civil war finally came to end. A constitutional monarchy had ruled Nepal before a Maoist group rebelled, seeking political representation. In 2008, the Maobadis won the first post-war elections. The political environment was still volatile, however, and the Nepalese government today still lacks the control and power to function properly.
What has suffered even worse than the political process in Nepal is the economy. Nepal’s economic structure is three-headed: agriculture, remittances and tourism. Seventy-five percent of the Nepalis are in some way involved with agriculture. Agriculture makes up 30 percent of Nepal’s GDP and is one of the largest forces in its economy. With the earthquake virtually wiping out entire stretches of land, it will be very difficult to recover the lost agriculture. The land that was destroyed in the earthquake will first have to be cleared of debris and rubble, and then reclaimed for agricultural use.
The second-largest component of the Nepalese economy stems from remittances — money sent by Nepalis back to their home country from abroad. The lack of jobs and career opportunities in Nepal have propelled some of the labor force to find work elsewhere, mostly in the Gulf states. The recent earthquake leveled homes and buildings, and most of those who moved for work will now be forced to go back to Nepal to help rebuild. Without adequate money and manpower, Nepalis will be stuck trying to balance redevelopment with putting food on the table.
Though it is not the largest component of the Nepalese economy, tourism is perhaps the country’s most notable industry. Tourists flock to Nepal year-round, with its beautiful, centuries-old architecture and landmarks seeped in the grandeur of art and culture. Home to Mount Everest, Nepal is also the starting line for hikers, adventurers, geologists and even those daring enough to climb the world’s tallest mountain. Many who were on the mountain when the earthquake struck were trapped, either crushed by the ensuing avalanches or unable to receive help because of the chaos below them.
The earthquake has decimated Nepal’s infrastructure, and tourism is sure to decline in the coming months and even years as people become wary of traveling to Nepal. Whereas before many were concerned about the stability of the government, most are now apprehensive of the geologic stability of the country itself. Nepal and the entire region are prone to large earthquakes, and tectonic plates from India will continue to push up against the Himalayas (after all, that’s how the mountains were formed initially). That does not mean Nepal or the surrounding countries should resign themselves to ill preparation, however.
Here in Los Angeles, “the big one” has been predicted for decades — and who’s to say when or if that will happen — but measures have been taken in the event that such an earthquakes hits. That’s why we need to think about Nepal in this case because the country lacks the infrastructure and money to prepare for another earthquake, and it is going to require the world community to help rebuild. Education is imperative — the country should receive coaching on how to reconstruct their buildings with the appropriate technologies in the event of future natural disasters. Ultimately, the political and economic climates are not advantageous for tourism now, but the global population shouldn’t abandon Nepal. The outpour of support on social media needs to be furthered.
It’s going to take a Mount Everest-sized effort to help Nepal climb and overcome this mountain.

Despite everything your parents, high school teachers, guidance counselors, and friends already in college have said, college isn’t just about being independent. Sure, it’s a big part of learning to live on your own, but during your first year away, there is a lot of support available for you. Chat up your RA, or go to office hours for your favorite professor. A seemingly forced relationship in your dorm or in class could blossom into a lovely friendship.
After spending a semester and a half complaining to everyone around me about our dining hall food, I made two significant changes in my life. One was my use of dining dollars. Man, those are a gift from heaven. Using them, I can now order the same thing from Lemonade every day. Probably the more obvious change I made, though, was simply going to another dining hall, which had different food and different people. Not sure why I didn’t think of that one sooner.
I would bet money that there is always some kind of event going on at USC. Sometimes I look out my dorm room window to see a bunch of people holding donuts and dancing to Pitbull on the lawn. Come join the party! If you ever feel bored at college, you’re doing it wrong. That is, unless you are waiting in line for the sushi burrito food truck like I did last week. When food trucks come to McCarthy quad, the lines are often long. Keep your head up. You’ll get to the front eventually.
It’s not high school anymore, folks. Unless you fall under a few specific majors or career tracks (sorry, pre-meds), a few grade mishaps here and there don’t spell out the end of the world for you. Of course, you are paying an obscene amount of money for your education now, so perhaps it is best to take it seriously. But be reasonable with your expectations: there is no cruising along in college and you will inevitably run into some roadblocks. Take it in stride. Your GPA is, after all, just a number.
Relish in the freedoms of freshman year, because once it’s over, you’ll never be one again. We are granted (some) immunity to have fun, make mistakes, and procrastinate to the fullest. Enjoy your year, and don’t take yourself too seriously. There’s always next year to worry over.

Summer is just around the corner, so you can expect Los Angeles heat waves to be hitting campus right about now. Instead of stretching yourself in front of AC or taking a dip in one of the many fountains on campus, cool off with easy-­to-­make popsicles!
I don’t know about you, but as a kid, in the summer I remember putting random beverages like lemonade and Capri Suns in the freezer when temperatures reached above 80 degrees. The frozen treats and slushies were so easy to make and provided a refreshing way to turn the heat down.
Popsicles can be made with virtually any liquid or yogurt, and you can add whatever additional ingredients you prefer. Last summer, I tried out a green tea popsicle recipe made with coconut milk and matcha green tea powder and loved the cool, creaminess of the popsicle. You can try out with this recipe.
After finding another can of coconut milk at Fresh & Easy and after some brief Pinterest scrolling, I was surprised to find so many popsicle recipes to try out with coconut milk. Though coconuts have had a bad rep in the past due to their high content of saturated fat, coconuts actually have the potential to help in weight loss, boost immune health and improve skin and hair quality, so I decided to try another recipe with coconut milk instead of using the usual fruit juice or yogurt that we are used to freezing.

“Why Argentina?” This is a question that I have been asked over and over again since I applied to study abroad in Buenos Aires last September.  For me, the answer was always an easy one.
I am an international relations student with a regional emphasis in Latin America, which I selected because of my Spanish language abilities and also because I am interested in the young, constantly changing democracies that have developed within this region.  One day, I want to work in this part of the world and I know that studying here would give me a good taste for what that might be like.
So after explaining my academic background to people who ask me this, I would then also explain that above all I wanted to become fluent in Spanish.  The next question I would just about always get would be, “So then why not go to Spain?”
While I did consider Spain for a little bit when I was first looking at study abroad programs, I always knew I did not want to be the traditional USC student studying abroad in Europe.  No, I have never been to Europe.  And yes, someday I would love the opportunity to explore that part of the world.  For me, however, studying abroad is an opportunity to fully immerse myself within a country and a language, which means going to a university where I take classes with a majority of local students, make local friends, and live and spend a majority of my time within that city.  I have luckily been able to do all of this and more through my program in Buenos Aires.
I am currently studying at the Universidad de San Andres, where all of my classes are conducted in Spanish and with local students.  I will admit that taking Foreign Policy Analysis in Spanish is not a cakewalk and does add an emphasis to the “study” of study abroad.  But I would not have things any other way.  This program has allowed me to make several friends from Argentina and who have been able to give me the local’s insight into the city.
Additionally, I am one of four students from USC in my program (none of which I knew prior to my program). I am also one of seven students from the U.S., so rarely am I with fellow Trojans or Americans, which means I am constantly speaking less English and more Spanish.  This has been great in that it has pushed me outside my comfort zone, and allowed me to make friends from all over the world.
To give you a taste, I found my own housing where I am living with people from France, England, Brazil, Venezuela, Honduras, Denmark and Germany.  What is the common language of the house you may ask?  I’d say we speak Spanish 50 percent of the time, English 40 perent of the time and then French 10 percent of the time (I didn’t know any French before coming here but I am trying to learn!).
Judging from the stories of my older friends who previously studied in European countries and many of the stories of my friends who are studying there now, my experiences in Buenos Aires are not the norm in their programs.  Many of the European programs have lots of other USC and American students with preset study and living arrangements that aren’t always in the language native to the country.  For many, studying with other U.S. students isn’t a drawback (like it was for me) and studying abroad in Europe gives the incredibly special opportunity to easily travel all over the continent.
I will admit that for a while I was disappointed that I wouldn’t have this mobility in Buenos Aires but knew I would be reaping the many other benefits of my choice.  I have been pleasantly surprised at the amount of traveling outside the city I have been able to do.  Traveling by bus in South America is inexpensive and surprisingly comfortable.  Additionally, with my student residency, I am able to get local discount prices on flights within Argentina.
Since arriving in Buenos Aires at the end of February, I have been able to travel to five different cities.  I started with the National Park of Iguazu where I saw the most incredible waterfalls.  I then backpacked through the famous Patagonian mountain region where I hiked the W Trek in Torres del Paine National Park of Chile, camped in El Chalten, Argentina — home of Fitz Roy, the mountain scape that many would recognize from Patagonia’s label — and saw the Perito Moreno Glacier in El Calafate, Argentina.  Additionally, this past weekend, I took the ferry across the Rio de la Plata to Uruguay where I spent the weekend exploring Colonia and Montevideo.  My next trip will be to Mendoza, the wine country where the famous Argentine Malbec wines are produced.
Though I will by no means be able to explore the entire South American continent during my time abroad, I will be able to explore five different countries.  These include Chile, Uruguay, Bolivia, Peru and, of course, Argentina.  It’s true that I’m not covering as much ground as students in Europe, but I do feel like I have been able to find a strong balance between immersion in Buenos Aires and exploring the rest of Argentina and the neighboring countries.
From my experience so far, I think students should really take a second look when choosing a study abroad program and consider South America.  I always want to be sure I am as tactful as possible when saying this because I have many friends who made the decision to go to Europe and have absolutely loved it.  For me, however, Buenos Aires was the perfect fit and a much different experience than the traditional USC study abroad student.  In the future, I hope more and more students will consider going further outside their comfort zones and study in a South America.
If you go to Argentina to learn Spanish you will likely come away speaking not Spanish but Argentinish, and be branded ever after among Spanish speakers for your distinctive weirdness in pronunciation, lexicon, and morphology.  Come to Argentina with dollars and quickly learn that life involves working those dollars through the black market.  After Argentina, few countries will ever appear to be truly dysfunctional or corrupt.  Remember that Argentina’s inflation was somewhere around 40 percent last year and the rapidly increasing costs of goods and services accelerate at a rate greater than the increased valuation of the US$ vs the ARS.   Come to Argentina and learn why the UN crime figures place this country as number one in theft rates in the entire western hemisphere.  And yes, I did my MS at USC.
Sabe, it sounds like you are secretly missing Argentina!:) The author has hit it spot on with the write-up, and the fact that Argentinian spanish is the most beuatiful spanish in the world (ask anybody non-spanish-speaking person) , it will be blessing to the student who takes it back home. You don’t have to exchnage your dollars on the black market here, but everybody does it when they to, including high level government officials ( a fact since the 70’s or before) . Actually the “black market” is most often the hotel concierge (lol). After living though Argentina’s mixture of technology and customs ranging from the 1950’s to the 21st century, one comes away with very intense pleasant sensasions of having been to an exciting and mysterious place like no other. I could go on and on. Hope you make it back soon!:)
No, it is not “beuatiful spanish” at all.  In fact if you knew your Argentine history you would recall that for a time the government here (Argentina) even proposed adopting the castellano-criollo-rioplatense as a language distinct from Spanish,  which over the years it has effectively become.  
You talk about Argentine “technology” but there is no such thing.  Argentine industry is nothing more than the assembly of products that have been designed elsewhere, in the modern countries.  Argentine manufactured products have no market outside of the Mercosur region because they are of such poor quality.  
If you know someone who has studied economics in Argentina you can ask them why the government penalises private economists who dare to publish economic statistics that differ from the “official”   (politically blessed) numbers.   This is a country that curiously blends Stalinist overtones with an enduring admiration for Mussolini,  and still can’t find a way to make the trains run on time.   (In fact some of the railways are in such terrible condition that it takes longer today to make some inter-provincial runs than it took back in 1890). 
Come to Argentina, where incompetence wears a pretty face,  here where you find the southern hemisphere’s capital for crime, corruption, economic mismanagement, and perpetual arrogance.
Sabe, that’s a nice pile of bulls**t you’re talking there. First of all our accent is fine, there is simply nothing wrong with it and it’s not any weirder than  every other Spanish accent in Latin America.
Also, a lot of the things you commented are far from being true.  What in the holly **** does the accent of a country have to do with politics and crime?. Good job at bringing two totally unrelated topics to this article, you tool. And if you hate the Argentine culture so much, then why not go live somewhere else?. Good luck finding a country with 0 crime rate and no corruption at all in the Americas.
Yes, definitely Peru and Colombia are far better choices than Argentina. Especially the latter. Sure, If you don’t mind the guerrillas and the whole drug cartel thing. 
For some positive advice, I would recommend you to quit spreading misleading lies about a country that you obviously know little or nothing about. It only just makes you sound like a complete ignorant chimp.
Let’s take those assumptions and review how the national (Argentine)  and international media have characterised these conditions. 
On the subject of the extremely high rate of robbery in Argentina, we are seeing more of more media references to “lynching” —  in fact so much so that this English word has become “linchamiento” in Argentinish, and now very much a part of the Argentine vocabulary, as ordinary citizens, disgusted with the Kirchner government’s handling of the high crime rate, are taking matters into their own hands.   
Here are some Argentine media observations on the high robbery rate, acknowledging that it’s the highest in the western hemisphere: 
“….Argentina tiene la tasa de robos más alta de América: 973 cada 100  mil habitantes. Según  precisó, en cuatro de cada diez hogares de centros  urbanos del país, fueron víctimas de al menos un delito durante el  último año y que hubo un homicidio en ocasión de robo cada dos días en
Capital y provincia de Buenos Aires….”
And the BBC coverage of lynchings can be found in the article entitled “Lo que hay detrás de los linchamientos en Argentina.”

The Los Angeles Police Department arrested 21-year-old Javier David Cardosa on Tuesday in connection with a series of sexual batteries in the University Park area.
Dept. of Public Safety Deputy Chief David Carlisle said Cardosa, a South Los Angeles resident, has no affiliation with the university.
Over the past two months DPS and LAPD collaborated to investigate several incidents in which a male suspect repeatedly slapped and groped the buttocks of females in the area.
“[Cardosa] made some admissions and we are confident he’s responsible for these sexual batteries — at least 12 of them,” Carlisle said.
The Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office has filed multiple charges of sexual battery against Cardosa.
