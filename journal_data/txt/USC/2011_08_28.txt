Gerald Davison, dean of the Davis School of Gerontology and executive director of the Andrus Gerontology Center, will resign as dean at the end of the academic year, according to a memorandum from Elizabeth Garrett, provost and vice president of academic affairs.
Davison decided to retire because, in his opinion, the school needed a more reputable dean in the field of gerontology to lead it forward.
After resigning, Davison, who has served as dean since 2007, plans to return to research work. He intends to work closely with the new dean to create a smooth transition and ensure the Davis School remains a global leader in the field of gerontology.
In his five years as dean, Davison has revamped the undergraduate program at the Davis School by adding new majors, including a bachelor of science in lifespan health, and initiated a new fundraising campaign.
The Davis School has also added five new tenured or tenure-track faculty members and received large grants from the National Institute of Aging and the National Institute of Environmental Health Science — among other government organizations and foundations — under Davison’s leadership.
R. Pete Vanderveen, dean of the USC School of Pharmacy, Martin Levine, vice provost for faculty affairs and Garrett will appoint a search committee to find a new dean, according to the memorandum.
Davison’s research has focused on experimental and philosophical analyses of psychopathology and therapeutic change. He is currently researching the relationship between cognition and behavioral and emotional problems. His book Clinical Behavior Therapy, co-authored with Marvin Goldfried, is one of only two publications recognized as Citation Classics by the Social Science Citation Index.
The university plans to announce a new dean this spring, according to the memorandum.

USC’s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered Student Resource Center has seen 10 times more transgendered students visit the center this year than in previous years.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
Increased activity in the USC LGBT community can be attributed to high national rankings of gay friendliness, said Vincent Vigil, director of the LGBT Student Resource Center.
Vigil said since the center was founded in 2005, USC has become one of the top schools for LGBT students.
USC received a perfect score on the campus climate index of gay friendliness for the fifth consecutive year from Campus Pride this summer, a nonprofit resource for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender college or college-bound students.
The campus climate index score is determined by a series of more than 50 questions that universities answer. Campus Pride’s website said questions fall into eight categories that “contribute to a more inclusive, welcoming and respectful LGBT and Ally campus.”
Out of 300 universities, USC was one of  33 schools that received a perfect score of five stars.
“LGBT students feel more comfortable applying to USC because of the rankings we’ve gotten from various organizations,” Vigil said.
He said he plans to lobby for more inclusive transgendered policies this year.
“Normally we have one or two students come in during the academic year, but we’ve had a dramatic increase,” Vigil said. “We have more transgendered students on campus than ever before and I want to make sure they feel comfortable and safe.”
Because USC has no formal housing policy for transgendered students, requests are currently handled on a case-by-case basis.
Tweleve buildings on campus have gender-neutral bathrooms, for those in the process of transitioning, but Vigil said the number will continue to increase.
“Luckily, as we continue to construct new buildings, the American Disabilities Act requires accessible bathrooms, which are usually also gender neutral,” Vigil said. “This happens whenever we build anything new or refurbish a building,”
The previous student health insurance did not address hormone therapy for transgendered students. Aetna Student Health insurance, which USC switched to last fall, provides deductibles for hormone therapy.
The Queer and Ally Student Assembly will also hold a talk about transgendered people at the School of Social Work for the first time later this semester, Vigil said.
“We hope students in the school, when they go on their lunch break, will come in and learn about how to work with transgendered people because this is relevant to their future professions,” Vigil said. “We’re also hoping to have more transgendered content in classes.”
QuASA co-hosted a panel about the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy in February attracted had a full room.
QuASA began to push for transgendered education programs in 2008 and began to hold Gender Justice Week, which is now Gender Justice Month, each November to raise awareness about gender identity and expression.
Vigil also said the LGBT center was calling itself the “LGBTQ center” in marketing materials, and might change its name formally in the future.
“We have been adding the Q [to LGBT] in our marketing materials because more and more students identify as queer,” Vigil said. “Also, the ‘Q’ can stand for queer and questioning, so we try to use it to be more inclusive.”
Vigil said the center will work to bolster programs started last year, such as Greek Chat, a confidential monthly discussion group for out, closeted and questioning members of the Greek community, and monthly “Bi-chats,” for bisexual or bi-curious students.
“We’re noticing more and more students identifying as bi and want to be as inclusive as possible with our programming,” Vigil said. “Unfortunately, we didn’t get as many people coming to Bi-chats as we wanted last year, so we’re hoping to advertise them better.”
The LGBT Student Resource Center facilitates several other programs, including Freshman Advocacy Board, to address LGBT students’ transition to college; weekly confidential discussion group University Rap, or uRap; Generation Queer, a weekend retreat for first-year LGBT students; Peer Mentoring and the Speakers’ Bureau, which sponsors discussions on LGBT awareness.
The LGBT Student Resource Center also helps manage the Rainbow Floor, a residential community in Century Apartments for LGBT students.
Rainbow Floor Residential Adviser Riss Edmond, a senior majoring in animation, said the floor is crucial for students.
“It provides a community for LGBT students,” Emond said. “They need support around, and we have a lot of support here.”
Rainbow Floor resident Stephano Di Paola, a senior majoring in art history, said he was grateful USC had the resources to maintain such an active LGBT center.
“We have the ability to put out these programs,” Di Paola said. “QuASA also provides a lot of events, support and attention that makes our community very
visible.”
There are a lot of individuals who identify as trans* that prefer to use “transgender” not “transgenderED”…when you add the “-ed” it implies that there is something that happened to change the person. “Transgender,” on the other hand implies that it is an inherent characteristic/attribute…it is grammatically an adjective rather than a past tense verb.
Using “transgendered” isn’t wrong, per se, but it should be acknowledged that some people do take offense to the term and prefer to drop the ‘-ed’ ending.
I was wondering when you became an animation major Riss
I like how my name has two different spellings and my major has suddenly become computer related. Nice job, DT.
I just thought you were bi-major
I don’t think so, Pike #1. I remember you from that pie email thing and I seriously doubt you have good intentions.
Where can I meet all these Bi girls?
Where does Greek Chat meet?

USC has introduced three new undergraduate minors this summer: social entrepreneurial studies at the Marshall School of Business, Korean studies through the East Asian Studies Center and the reinstatement of German studies through the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts & Sciences.
Students say the new minors will help them show specialities when applying to jobs. Specializing in a variety of fields give students that opportunity, said Rebecca Miller, a senior majoring in Russian and international relations.
“As an international relations and Russian major, I believe that a strong background in language skills can be an extremely useful asset for almost any career, be it in policy, academia or the Foreign Service,” Miller said. “Russia and Germany have close historical, political, and economic ties. For that reason, I decided to take both Russian and German classes.”
The new German studies minor offers a complete language program featuring a student-centered approach to language learning and a comprehensive undergraduate curriculum with an interdisciplinary orientation.
“The reinstatement of the German studies minor is a step towards remedying what was lost with regard to academic opportunities for USC students after the closure of the German department,” Bothe said.
Other departments have similar plans to attract students to their academic areas. The East Asian Studies Center added a minor in Korean studies because it saw an increased interest in Korea across campus.
“North Korean nuclear provocations are headline news in the [United States], Samsung and Hyundai are well-known multinational companies and many Korean musical acts or movies are popular around the world,” said David Kang, director of the Korean Studies Institute and professor of international relations and business. “USC offers many classes that address these issues, and instituting a minor will allow students to get credit if they are interested in learning more about Korea, or perhaps one day plan to work in Korea.”
JiYeon Lee, a junior majoring in international relations, also said the Korean studies minor is a great way to be better equipped for a global job market, one that expects not just business knowledge, but an understanding of how business changes within an international context.
“As Korea enters the global playing field as a technical innovator and a booming economy with a central location for global political discussion, it is important to watch how this peninsula transforms and shapes the East Asian region and, more importantly, the global terrain,” Lee said. “USC’s Korean Studies Institute offers academic conferences, distinguished speaker series and lectures to both its undergraduate and graduate community. It is an especially exciting time to get involved with Korean studies at USC.”
The Marshall School of Business also introduced a new minor in social entrepreneurship. The idea for the new minor arose when then-Provost C. L. Max Nikias expressed an interest in creating a social entrepreneurial program at USC.
“In the last few years the university has seen a growing number of students interested in social entrepreneurship,” said Abby Fifer Mandell, assistant director at the Marshall Society and Business Lab. “They are basically young people who want to make a difference in the world and want the business skills offered at Marshall.”
He said the Marshall School sees new minor as a way to help students change the world regardless of major.
“One component we are happy about is that this is interdisciplinary,” Mandell said. “Student can choose courses across the university and customize the minor to their needs. We are hoping students will have a broad range of options with courses from the business school, public policy, engineering and sociology.”
These new minors provide students with a more global perspective and the ability to make a global impact, Mandell said.
“We find Trojans want to change their world,” Mandell said. “They want to solve problems such as healthcare, poverty and education both locally and globally.”

USC will launch the largest fundraising campaign in the school’s history this fall, aiming to raise $5 billion in seven years.
The “Campaign for the University of Southern California,” announced Sunday, will officially kick off Sept. 15 and will support academic goals and building projects university-wide.
Under the leadership of President C. L. Max Nikias, the university has already received gifts totaling more than $1 billion. The university’s goal of raising $6 billion by 2018 — the $1 billion already received and the $5 billion campaign — is the most ambitious fundraising goal in higher education to date.
The university intends to use half of the $6 billion to significantly increase the size of its endowment, which at about $3 billion is considered small given the number of students and the size of the school. The rest of the money raised will go toward new buildings and labs that will span disciplines including the social sciences, arts and medicine.
Specific goals include adding more student scholarships, increasing support for doctoral and postdoctoral students, revamping undergraduate residential colleges and adding graduate student housing.
Undertaking a major fundraising campaign has been a primary goal for Nikias since he took over  as president. USC’s last major capital campaign concluded in 2002 and was the most successful fundraising effort in higher education history to that point, raking in $2.85 billion in nine years.
Since then, a number of universities have surpassed that total, but none have attempted a bid at the $6 million mark.
Columbia University is currently trying to raise $5 billion, a goal it set after surpassing its original $4 billion goal.
Harvard University has indicated its upcoming campaign might reach higher than that, according to the Harvard Crimson, but an official number has not been
announced.

Scribbled in white paint across the entrance of the grass to Howard Jones Field, written in all capital letters for everyone to see, is this message: “No Distractions.”
Responsibility · Junior quarterback Matt Barkley was named one of four captains for the season. As a third-year starter, he will be asked to lead a group of young wide receivers and running backs on offense. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
With just six days left until the Trojans’ first game, that message is now louder and more important than ever.
“We treated today like game week,” junior quarterback Matt Barkley said after Sunday’s full-pad practice. “Full gameplan today, full scouting reports. It was basically an extra day of practice we wouldn’t normally get.”
With that opening game less than a week away, the Trojans named their four captains for the season before practice. Senior tight end Rhett Ellison, senior defensive tackle Christian Tupou, junior safety T.J. McDonald and Barkley were selected by their teammates.
“I kinda saw it coming,” Barkley said sheepishly. “But it’s an honor nonetheless. I’m proud to lead these guys into battle and to know that I have their respect.”
USC coach Lane Kiffin extended praise to all of his captains.
“I’m proud of those guys,” Kiffin said. “I’m happy for them to be leading the team this season.”
The practice started at 10:45 a.m., and ended with the midday sun blaring down on the field. But that wasn’t seen as a negative by the coaching staff.
“I’m glad that we were out here this time of day,” Kiffin said. “It was one of our warmer days. It’s more what it will be like six days from now [on gameday].”
Barkley wouldn’t complain, either.
“I definitely think we’re well conditioned for whatever team we play,” Barkley said.
Kiffin highlighted conditioning and depth as themes for the team. He highlighted the first two games of last year, when Hawaii and Virginia each scored on their final possession of the first half.
With the incoming recruiting class getting lots of repetitions in practice, the coaching staff believes it is  a much deeper squad compared to last season.
“We want to [play more players] at a number of spots,” Kiffin said. “And that’s up to our backups, to make sure that we have confidence in them. Even if the first team guy is a little better he can’t be playing 70 snaps.”
Senior linebacker Chris Galippo echoed similar sentiments.
“The difference between playing 40 plays and playing 75 plays, when you’re in the two minute drill in the fourth quarter … it’s huge,” Galippo said.
Galippo practiced with the team for the first time after being sidelined with a right shoulder injury. But he looked impressive, knocking a pass away — with his right arm — from junior running back Curtis McNeal. Galippo said he wouldn’t have been able to make that play a week ago.
“I felt great,” Galippo said. “I was able to wrap a couple of tackles and finish out practice. So that felt good.”
Galippo’s status for the season opener, however, is still uncertain.
“I’m confident that I can get in the game,” he said. “As many full-contact reps as I’ve missed I’ve still stayed engaged mentally and stayed in shape. It’s about getting the contact side down this week and getting used to the hitting tempo.”
 
—
 
The team had a special surprise off-day Saturday. USC came out for what Barkley described as a “special teams walk-through” in shorts and tennis shoes — no pads.
They practiced downing punts inside the five, but junior punter Kyle Negrete kept kicking the ball too far. So far, in fact, that it cleared the fence and landed in the Lyon Center pool.
“Kiff just exploded and kicked us off the field,” Barkley said. “We leave and all the managers are there with towels and shorts for us, and we got to go swimming. So Negrete was in on it. I think he even flipped coach off for good measure.”
Kiffin said his team deserved the day off, but also offered a more practical reason than just plain fun.
“I don’t think we would have been physically able to practice,” Kiffin said. “That would have been five days in a row. And then to come out here today, I don’t think we could have physically done that and practiced well at all.”

It was far from a perfect weekend for the USC women’s soccer team, but after losing three straight games to begin the season, it’ll take it.
The Women of Troy picked up their first win of the 2011 campaign with a 2-1 victory over Pacific in the University of San Diego tournament on Sunday.
Winner · Senior forward/defender Ashley Freyer scored her first goal of the season against Pacific, as USC notched its first victory of the year. - Daily Trojan file photo
“I think the ladies definitely had a little bit more focus and determination today,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “We all felt it. We were definitely committed to defending as a unit and I think we did that.”
USC began the tournament by losing 3-2 to Kansas on Friday, a loss that dropped the team to 0-3 despite coming into the year ranked No. 25 in the nation.
“We’ve been playing well, but the first three games we just weren’t able to finish,” Khosroshahin said.
USC scored first against the Jayhawks and played to a 2-2 tie at halftime but allowed Kansas to score the eventual game-winning goal in the 63rd minute on a shot from freshman midfielder Jamie Fletcher.
“We started the weekend as low as you can get,” senior forward Ashley Freyer said. “We just weren’t finishing like we would have liked to. But then we came out against Pacific and finally were able to do what we needed to.”
Freyer got USC on the board just three minutes into Sunday’s game with her first goal of the season. Brittany Kerridge followed it up moments later with a penalty kick that sailed past Pacific goalkeeper Tashia Long and into the net for a 2-0 USC lead.
“We needed to come out strong,” Kerridge said. “We needed it to boost our confidence. It was just a matter of making a decision to go out there and get it done.”
Freyer also admitted attaining the first win of the year was beginning to weigh on the team.
“We knew we had to come out today and perform,” she said. “Once you get that first one out of the way, it becomes a lot easier to just focus on playing.”
USC sophomore goalkeeper Shelby Church held Pacific at bay for the first 88 minutes of the contest, until Pacific junior midfielder Angelica Figueroa scored on a penalty kick in the waning moments of the game.
“I thought it was a good first win for us,” Khosroshahin said. “It was way overdue, but you have to take it step by step. We’re coming around slowly. It was little bit too slow for my taste and for the girls’ taste but we’re definitely committed to getting better.”
The Women of Troy will stay on the road and travel to Champaign, Ill. to take on Illinois and then to West Lafayette, Ind. to face off with Purdue before heading home for the Trojan Invitational on Sept. 9.

The USC men’s water polo program is easy to compliment. It’s become, more or less, the pretty girl at the bar.
And it’s easy to see why.
Over the last three seasons, the Trojans have compiled an overall mark of 83-4 en route to three straight NCAA championships.
With the 2011 season slated to begin in five days, nothing has changed.
“This really could be our best team, talent-wise and defensively,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said without wincing — not even once.
It wouldn’t be groundbreaking to note things are going well for Vavic and company. The lone departures from a year ago are driver Mason Hawthorne, who graduated in May, and two-meter Zayne Belal, who left the program. Everyone else is back, hoping to become the first team in the history of the sport to win a fourth consecutive national title.
“We’ve never had this before,” Vavic said when asked about the high number of returners. “This is a very unique situation.”
It’s certainly a remarkable turn of events for a USC program that prior to 1998 had never won a men’s water polo national title. It begs the question: How did things get this good? How did the California collegiate water polo scene change so dramatically and so drastically in USC’s favor?
In short, recruiting.
“Players that are joining us now want to win a championship,” Vavic said. “They want to win it now and this is where they see their best chance.”
Vavic has, no doubt, stockpiled on the recruiting trail. Four titles in six seasons unquestionably remains a significant draw for many. There’s little question there.
But the 17-year coach also credits the school’s meteoric rise on the academic spectrum for USC’s current place atop the water polo food chain.
“USC has become much better academically,” Vavic said. “I think our university has done a great job improving the academic side.”
The Daily Beast has already named USC the hottest school of the decade.
“Stanford. Duke. Northwestern. These are just some of the schools that counselors report USC will soon surpass as one of most sought-after campuses in the country,” it said.
And last fall U.S. News & World Report ranked USC 23rd among national universities, ahead of crosstown rival UCLA.
Perhaps most notably, the school, under President C. L. Max Nikias, has raised $1 billion in the last year as part of a campaign to garner a total of $6 billion — the largest fundraising goal in American academia, according to the Los Angeles Times.
“In times where other schools are struggling, because they depend on government money, we are really able to do so well,” said Vavic, who says he has used this as a selling point to recruits. “I think it’s really nice to be able to see there’s a program out there not struggling.”
Academics and athletics don’t always go hand in hand, which makes water polo’s situation all the more rare.
Sports such as football and men’s basketball have historically been hampered by increasing academic standards, as well as the NCAA’s Academic Progress Rate, which was instituted in February 2005.
Vavic, however, has emphasized the classroom, while bringing in top recruiting classes annually.
“Water polo is not something that’s going to set you up for life,” Vavic said. “You aren’t going to do this forever. If you’re a football player or a basketball player, you have a chance to go to the pros. Here, we don’t.”
It’s a different mentality that contrasts football, Vavic said.
“Water polo players are primarily academically oriented,” Vavic said. “So many of these kids that are coming to our school are coming here for academics.”
But even still, for a team this good, this talented, it’s tough to simply dub them “academically oriented.” It boasts a trio of senior All-Americans in two-meter Matt Burton, goalie Joel Dennerley and driver Peter Kurzeka that are among the best nationally, as well as a talented group of underclassmen highlighted by sophomores Nikola Vavic and Jeremy Davie, who led USC in scoring in 2010, with 49 and 41 goals respectively.
“Our entire starting unit is back and all are healthy,” Vavic said, as he made a point to knock on his wooden desk. “They’re hungry too with all the new guys and guys who redshirted last season.”
Because of their recent run of near-invincibility, Vavic contends the current group ranks among his best in recent memory.
“We are extremely balanced at every position,” Vavic said. “We are basically three deep everywhere and the competition for playing time is fierce.”

After winning the first two sets during Saturday’s contest against No. 1 Penn State, the No. 2 USC women’s volleyball team couldn’t stave off the Nittany Lions’ late-match comeback, as the four-time defending NCAA champions won three straight sets to hand the Women of Troy their first loss of the season in the Rockvale Outlets/AVCA Showcase.
Leading the way · Sophomore outside hitter Kirby Burnham finished with a career-high 15 kills for the Women of Troy against No. 1 Penn State. Despite her contributions, USC fell to the four-time defending NCAA champions in five sets, 3-2. - Daily Trojan file photo
Early on, things seemed to be working in USC’s favor.
Rattling off seven straight points to take control of the first frame, freshman middle blocker Hannah Schraer led the way in the first frame to give USC a 25-21 victory, scoring the final three points of the set with a kill and two blocks.
The second set worked to the Women of Troy’s advantage yet again, as senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter who would end up with 22 kills, 13 digs and a selection on the all-tournament squad led the way, recording a late-set kill to give USC the lead.
On top of Jupiter’s performance, sophomore outside hitter Kirby Burnham was also instrumental in the group’s initial surge, finishing with a career-high 15 kills and four kills in the set. Again, USC won 25-21.
But the lead didn’t last.
In the third set, Penn State ran out to a 14-9 lead behind outside hitter Deja McClendon, who finished with a match-high 25 kills. While they had to stave off a small USC rally, the Nittany Lions proved too much in the third pulling away 25-20.
The fourth set was the back-breaker for the Women of Troy and their hopes to take over the No. 1 spot atop the polls.
Though USC sprinted out to a commanding 14-6 lead, the Nittany Lions roared back with a 13-5 run, including two kills from McClendon, to tie the game at 19 apiece.
With the set all square at 22, Nittany Lions freshman setter Micha Hancock, who accounted for six aces on the day, once again changed the tide of the match with her serve, as Penn State would get another kill from McClendon and even the match with back-to-back blocks to end the set with a 25-22 victory.
After swinging the match back in their favor with two straight wins, the Nittany Lions continued to ride a wave of momentum in the fifth set.
A 10-2 start in the final set destroyed any hope the Women of Troy had of salvaging the match, as their spirits were crushed by Penn State and its home-court advantage.
The Nittany Lions would punctuate their comeback victory with a kill from McClendon, as they would take the final set 15-8.
Roles were reversed the day prior, however, as USC upended No. 12 Minnesota after dropping the first two sets, eventually winning 3-2 over the Gophers.
USC travels to Fort Myers, Fla. Friday to play in the Florida Gulf Coast Invitational, squaring off against Central Florida, Furman and the Florida Gulf Coast, as well as Clemson in a non-tournament match.
Mentally this team needs to improve. Penn St. got upset by lowly Oregon the night before so ripe for a loss
by the Trojans if they are a  #2 ranked team. Basically USC got swept losing the last three sets with showing
no fortitude in the fifth one. This is a carryover from the final four disgrace against Cal last season. It is time
for some changes on the coaching staff not the same since Paula Weisshoff left as an assistant.

Ground Zero, a home away from home for pop music students, ended the first week of classes last Friday night with its Indie Tune show. Headlining the performance was Kiven, a band hailing from Los Angeles, that formed here at USC.
Open mic · Band Kiven performed at Ground Zero Performance Café, providing an exhilirating musical ride that pleased USC students. - Alex Dealy | Daily Trojan
The definition of indie music can mean something different for everyone. Though some of the other bands that played at Indie Tune generally fit the genre, headliner Kiven doesn’t necessarily define its group in the same way.
The only original member of Kiven, Tyler Demorest, considers the group a “brand-new band in this collective unit.”  The group members found each other at USC and recently picked up sophomore A.J. Novak after losing their previous drummer.
Novak eagerly backs the idea that Kiven is indie, but the other members aren’t too sure.
Lead singer Demorest believes indie music has changed a lot over the years.
“Now I think it’s mustaches and hipster boots. I don’t know if we’re quite there,” he said jokingly.
Kiven has been influenced by bands such as Thrice, Muse and Radiohead, but as guitarist Danny Schnair — a studio jazz guitar major — mentioned, each member has a different background in music, bringing something different to the table.
Many bands focus on standing out from other groups. Kiven would rather concentrate on going with the flow instead of forcing something that doesn’t suit it.
“We’re not trying to be anything, so what comes out is authentic,” Demorest said.
Demorest thinks of music as the only universal form of expression, and sophomore bassist Matt Cohen says the band’s inspiration evolves from varying places depending on the members’ location, mentality and their personal situations.
As for releases, Kiven opted for a live-session album, which served as a great way for this self-labeled live band to indulge in its classification. Last week Kiven posted three videos on Facebook and released Noise Coalition Live Sessions with the same three live tracks.
The videos and audio tracks were recorded in a section of Cohen’s friend’s house, which was turned into a recording studio.
When performing in front of a crowd, no matter what size, they aim for a high energy show. “If you put on a good show and you mean it [and] it’s real, then they’ll feel it too,” Demorest said.
Novak finds it important for the members to leave their personal baggage at the door to do their fans a favor. “Otherwise it kind of brings the show down. They won’t know specifics, but they’ll notice that we’re upset,” he said.
At Indie Tunes, Kiven left all baggage at the door and created a worthwhile experience for the packed coffeehouse. For Cohen, seeing people’s reaction to the band’s set is a “natural high.”
Performing in front of an audience is completely different from playing in a practice space.
“It’s almost like as if you’re taking a leap of faith and you kind of hope you’re going to get caught,” Schnair said.
If Schnair literally took that leap of faith into the audience, the students rocking out in the front row probably wouldn’t have hesitated to catch him, judging by how engrossed they were in the performance.
A great show always seems to bring people together.
“Since [the fans and the band] all had that experience together, I feel like I can go up and introduce myself because we kind of know each other already,” Novak said.
Ultimately, Kiven hopes to make a living by doing what it loves: performing. Demorest dreams of performing at Red Rocks, a beautiful Colorado amphitheatre, giving more motivation for Kiven to mature as a band.
Kiven hopes to release a six or seven song EP in December, but until then, listeners can get a free download of Coalition Live Sessions from the band’s website  and look out for upcoming shows.

You didn’t need to be out partying last Thursday night to have some fun.
USC’s own student-run sketch comedy groups assembled at the Ground Zero Performance Café on Aug. 25, to discuss sex, drugs and saving a friend from quicksand with a tarantula.
Good times · Christian Daly and Lila Scott, members of Second Nature, sent Ground Zero’s audience into raging fits of laughter. - Matthew Wunderlich | Daily Trojan
The “3 Troupe Improv-a-ganza”  organizes each year as a signature event in USC’s first-week festivities. This year, the event saw an impressive turnout when Second Nature, the Merry Men and Commedus Interruptus performed.
Despite the recent summer vacation, each of the three troupes garnered enthusiasm with equally lively, rowdy and inappropriate shows.
Second Nature, USC’s premier long-form sketch comedy group, performed first and was wildly successful. The troupe completed various skits with topics ranging from an alcoholic principal to animals in mating season.
Unlike the other two troupes, Second Nature placed less emphasis on audience interaction and structured sketches and more on plain, old-fashioned improv.
Seasoned members senior Devin Field and junior Ian Carr exuded expert wit and chemistry in each of their scenes.
In one sketch, Carr and Field assumed the roles of elementary school children on a playground arguing over claimed territories.
“The slide is made of metal, and it’s 95 degrees out. Everyone hates the slide,” Carr said.
Both Carr and Field sent the audience hollering with their naturally goofy interactions and hilariously apt one-liners.
Sophomore Charlie O’Connor also showcased impressive versatility. O’Connor played a German soldier in one scene and a nine-year-old girl in another.
Perhaps the group’s funniest sketch was one in which Field became a target of “hetero-phobia.” The joke’s off-beat sense of humor explored the more serious theme of homophobia and simultaneously parodied society’s double standards in a hilariously wacky yet sympathetic way.
Though Second Nature is rather traditional in its commitment to long-form improv, the Merry Men and Commedus Interruptus are more structured and thus succeeded in gaining reactions through a style that focused on direct audience involvement.
Head of the Merry Men junior Andrew Glick led his colorful-tights-wearing Brits in an array of familiar sketches and in a new scenario, in which the troupe selected an audience member, accused her of being a “witch” and voted whether to burn or drown her.
Junior Ian Newman stood apart from his fellow group members with his clever phrases and comical personas.
In a sketch about bringing a king a specific gift, Newman said, “I brought you Wilson the volleyball from the film Castaway.”
Newman’s eccentric pop culture reference made the line hilarious and, throughout the night, became a trademark of his sense of humor.
The Merry Men’s most infamous game “Blaze” (a game notorious for its frequent incorporation of innapropriate one-liners) also ignited laughter with its innocent innuendos and downright dirty declarations. In one round, members compared their “ladies” to a bank, resulting in references to a “sperm bank” as well as explicit one-liners.
Similarly,Commedus Interruptus, the last group to enter the stage, performed several of its signature sketches.
The troupe opened its show with its “Da Doo Run Run” game (a singing/rhyming game in which the troupe  competes against each other) and had the audience roaring in delight almost instantly. Junior Damien Haas was the quickest on his feet and dominated the sketch after several rounds of on-the-spot rhyming and astute repartee. Not surprisingly, the game, much like the Merry Men’s “Blaze,” became funnier as the jokes took on a more sexual nature.
Commedus Interruptus ended the night on a strong note with several of its skits erupting in much-deserved applause.
By the end of the night, the improv-a-ganza was not only an outlet for stressed students but a comedic success.
Although the three troupes are each hilarious in their own rights, the event fostered a united feeling of off-the-wall, laid-back comedy, which was exactly what students needed after a long first week.
There are free, high-quality improv shows every Friday night at Ground Zero.

When I lived in Singapore, I was pampered by the cheap Chinese dishes with varying tastes and textures at food courts, the dim sum dishes from hawker stalls and the occasional multi-course Chinese banquet during special events.
Tasty rolls · Most Chinese-American dishes wouldn’t satisfy the tastes of Chinese gourmets, but are successful at enticing locals. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
But in the United States, all I found was dishes that serve the same goopy, sweet and greasy sauce on chicken, pork or shrimp with a crescent-moon shaped cracker on the side. I realized quickly the Chinese food in America was a different cuisine in and of itself.
Like it or not, Chinese food has seeped into the American tradition. It’s a common joke that on Christmas Jewish families celebrate the day off by piling into their local version of Chinatown Express. In the Los Angeles Grand Central Market, an abundance of Latino customers sit around the booths at China Café and scoop generous amounts of chili oil into their chop suey noodles.
This culinary landscape is vastly different from the one in mid-19th-century America, when Chinese immigrants from Canton (now Guangdong province of China) first started settling in large groups in California.
From little carts by worksites, Chinese cuisine pushed through the forefront of America’s mainstream culinary scene to brick-and-mortar restaurants and fast food chains since the ’20s.
Chinese food became popular not just because the American palate got bolder, but because Chinese cuisine was open to adjustments. The most popular “Chinese” dishes on the menu — sweet and sour pork, beef broccoli or orange chicken — are all cheap and fast basic meat-and-vegetable dishes drenched in standard sauces that are easily adaptable or substitutable to fit the American palate.
Indeed, more so than the native cuisine, these ethnic-inspired dishes reveal more about American history and culture than they do about Chinese.
After World War II, perhaps because of the greater attention on East Asian countries brought home by war veterans or because of the growing middle class, Americans actively branched away from the usual Cantonese dishes to incorporate other regional cuisines such as Hunan, Szechuan and Fujien. Instead of just looking for a fast, affordable meal, Americans became more interested in the experience of these “exotic” new cuisines.
Now in Los Angeles, Chinese food is accessible in varying levels of authenticity. Discerning foodies might immediately taste the difference between an “authentic” Chinese restaurant and an Americanized version of the food, but the most obvious disparity is location.
Take-out Chinese-American eateries pervade every street, most likely with the words that clearly indicate Chinese (“panda” and “Hong Kong” for example). But those who seek a more authentic bite will need to travel out to cities in San Gabriel Valley like Monterey Park and Arcadia, where restaurants will be less ostensibly “Oriental.”
Interior design and service is another indicator — even before you taste the food, use your eyes. The popular Chinese-American chain P.F. Chang’s, for example, decks out its dining room with calligraphy and paintings of royal concubines, while Mama’s Lu at Monterey Park is low-key and modest in design.
As for the food, the most tangible way to distinguish an authentic dish from an unauthentic one is the sauce Americanized dishes are heavier, sweeter and richer on the sauce. The spice level is toned down; a kung pao dish at P.F. Chang’s keeps its chili peppers gently fried to keep their heat from permeating the rest of the ingredients, as opposed to the more traditional way of charring the chilies so that the spiciness breaks out of the capsicum shells.
To be fair, Chinese cuisine is incredibly diverse. China is a huge country with myriad regional cuisines, and its emmigrants take their dishes all over the world, transforming them according to local diets. In fact, many Chinese natives have not experienced dishes outside their respective familiar regions.
The majority of the “Chinese” restaurants in America might horrify a native Chinese gourmet, but they played an initial and integral role in diversifying the American culinary appetite and opening the doors to other Asian cuisines, such as Japanese and Vietnamese.
Nine years since I visited my first Chinese-American restaurant, I’ve learned to crave chicken in cornstarch-laden sauce after a long day. Once in a while, there is something nice and special about breaking apart a fortune cookie after some greasy chow mein with moo shu chicken.
Perhaps it’s a sign that I, too, have broadened my tastes to America.

Great Article!!! Sophia. Love your writing.
not true, it IS to fit the american palate. it’s just like how taco bell/chipotlr is not authentic mexican either. and italian restaurants in the US NEVER does it al dente.
chinese cuisine is either really fresh (bland) really spicy or really weird (think whole fish/fish head, whole chicken, liver, etc).
but in general, it is difficult to completely replicate many of the chinese cuisine in the US. since different flour is used, and there is a lack of fresh seafood/poultry (it comes with a very high cost)
if the “running dogs” and “black devils” want more authentic chinese food, they should go to san grabriel valley. otherwise, it’s not feasible to NOT adapt to the american palate.
Fit the American palate?  Maybe the ones bringing in the goods just gave em their cheapest ingredients since after all, what else do white “running dogs” and “black devils” deserve?  Then most would never be the wiser, not having a chance to try the home cooking.  So the title could be “How Cheapass Chinese Haters Shaped American-Chinese Cuisine”.  I’m a running dog, btw.
[…] the night was still awesome, because I got to hang with wonderful company and got inspiration for my column on Chinese-American […]

Film and controversy have converged time and time again. There are topics that are truly difficult for any director to tackle and sometimes the story the director chooses to tell results in criticism or anger.
Design by Deborah Ho | Daily Trojan
Director Maryam Keshavarz has embraced this risk in her first feature fiction film, Circumstance, a story that takes viewers into a highly forbidden romance in Iran.
Teenagers Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) and Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) display the stereotypical behavior of budding teenagers searching for personal and sexual freedom. But the risk is increased as they live in Iran, a country with morality police and strict expectations for women.
While on a car trip to the beach, Atafeh awakens to hear the orphaned Shireen crying in her sleep and calling out to her mother. Keshavarz uses this moment to introduce the story. After Atafeh holds Shireen and comforts her, the two lay side by side and Keshavarz cleverly changes the lighting and music as we discover this friendship is actually a romance.
Atafeh’s brother Mehran (Reza Sixo Safai) catches on to the girls’ closeness and the tension builds. Shireen eventually finds herself married to Mehran, much to Atafeh’s shock.
Touching on the issues of Iranian customs, family relations, drug use, religion and more, Keshavarz creates a tale that is intriguing, but does not reach its full potential. The acting is successful and Keshavarz allows the camera to linger on the actors’ faces in close-up shots that maximize emotion, but she does not make the story as heart-wrenching as it could be.
Though Boosheri and Kazemy are both charming and their chemistry is believable, there is not sufficient background on their relationship to make us sincerely sympathetic. We see the girls laugh, dance and become increasingly more intimate but there is not a single scene in the movie in which we see them having a full conversation — except about them running away.
We know the girls attend the same school but we don’t see their friendship develop. This makes it difficult to truly connect with the characters; Keshavarz is obviously committed to taking into consideration societal and familial issues with the girls’ relationship but a few more scenes of pure interaction would have helped viewers connect with their situation.
The most touching scene comes when Atafeh’s mother Azar (Nasrin Pakkho) speaks to Atafeh after a run-in with the law.
Azar tells her daughter, “Sometimes we must accept our reality,” later singing to her to recall the days when Atafeh was a young girl without a care in the world. But Atafeh does not seem to feel any empathy toward her parents, a trait that actually works against the audience’s ability to empathize with her.
The drama and tension build but never fully boil over. When Atafeh discovers Mehran has been recording her every activity via hidden cameras and knows everything, her reaction is not given adequate screen time. Keshavarz only gives us one abrupt and mostly unsatisfying scene after this discovery before ending the film. Mehran’s motives for setting up cameras in his own home in the first place also go unexplained.
The talented cast brings to life complex characters, but the film seems unclear about where to put this talent. Mehran is an especially complex character but sometimes the focus is too much on him and his own story. Kesharvaz dedicates a lot of time to the dynamics of the family as a whole and as individuals, but this makes the film overpopulated with characters; the real focus is clearly on Atafeh and Shireen from the beginning and it should have remained so.
In the end, Kesharvaz fails to make as much of an impact as other films dealing with struggles regarding homosexuality.
And despite winning the audience award at Sundance in the Dramatic Competition, Circumstance only grazes the surface.
Finally, Ms Keshavarz, you have made a movie that will allow the mullahs to accuse the Iranian diaspora to be not only morally bankrupt (from their perspective) but also creatively and intellectually bankrupt.  Yours must have been the most melodramatic, superficial, and sheepish treatment of this subject that anyone could have come up with.  With the exception of their utterly contrived homosexuality, your characters resembled the worst of our petite bourgeous, mindless youth in their thinness, superficiality and conventional outlook.  
There’s yet another reason why your film completely divorced from reality – in the uppor middle classes that you and your two equally fake leads come from, it is well known that homosexual relationships are handled in a hush-hush and passive aggressive way by the families (e.g. along the lines of “you’re not getting that Lexus or Porsche”) not by the mullahs (who are themselves in denial about what is rampant at the Qom Seminary);
because even in the mullah’s “islamic paradise” the old Persian saying holds: “there are two things which make no noise – the dying of poor, and the f*cking around of the rich.” 
 Ms. Keshavarz, maybe like your untalented lead actresses, you should have become a doctor or a lawyer instead of a filmmaker – that way you could have felt that you were worth something without affirming people’s worst stereotypes about Iranians; that even in tackling taboos subjects, they are obnoxious, superficial, and terminally gaudy.  
The mullah’s value system is an easy target – even they don’t believe in it.  Why won’t a serious Iranian filmmaker come along who takes on the messed-up, superficial, and terribly flawed secular value system which keeps us in chains even when we’re abroad, and which produces such vacuous, conventional minds as that of Ms. Keshavarz?

The economy is obviously struggling. People are wary of spending money freely, and watching their expenses carefully.
As a result, the increasingly expensive financial and personal investment that is education has emerged as a stress.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
At a time when families are pressed for money and wondering if their children will be able to secure jobs after graduation to repay loans, making such an expensive investment with fewer and fewer economic guarantees seems questionable.
But at the end of the day, a suffering economy demands more investment in education. Disinvestment is not the answer; rather, a rethinking of how schools spend their money is in order so they can better serve the students.
USC students are familiar with the challenges of paying top dollar for an education. It’s likely that by the end of a student’s educational career here, he or she might be knee-deep in debt.
There is undeniable evidence, however, that any investment in higher education is a good one.
A high school graduate earns about 40 percent more than a high school dropout, and a college graduate earns about 50 percent more than an individual with only a high school diploma.
Even if you have to take out loans now, it’s a worthwhile investment for your long-term financial, professional and personal future.
Judith Scott-Clayton, assistant professor of economics and education at Teachers College at Columbia University, wrote in a recent debate on The New York Times website on the topic of the value of educational investment: “Any cure for this anemic economy is going to involve a more educated and better-educated population, not less,” she said. “This doesn’t mean that educational programs should be exempt from questions about effectiveness and efficiency.”
If students don’t feel they’re getting what they’re paying for, universities need to change.
Students’ interests should be represented in terms of class selection and requirements.
The concept of core requirements can be incredibly restrictive and can take away time and money from students’ true interests.
Transfer students in particular receive the short end of the stick when it comes to USC’s general education requirements — they are forced to repeat unnecessary, lower level general education classes that take precious time away from their major classes.
Why not change the general education system to be more flexible and tailored to students’ interests? The result would be more satisfied, engaged students who would develop better work habits in the areas of study they actually care about.
Becoming a well-rounded student is important. The goal of these programs is not to bore us with classes that seem tedious but to deepen our interest in fields we might not have been interested in before.
But there must be changes to the general education system to maximize the value of school. Lessening the amount of requirements is a positive first step.
There is also value in spending smarter, not less — for example, increasing teacher pay to draw the best of the best to USC, or using funds to reduce class size.
Education is too key of an asset to ignore or discard because of financial concerns. The fact of the matter is that education is a requirement in most of the workforce. Students and administrators must work together to ensure that the university is run in the most cost-efficient way possible.
It’s idealistic to think schools can run in perfect parallel to our interests and needs, but seeing as we are making such a large investment and should continue to do so, we deserve more say in what we’re paying for.

The rift between Democrats and Republicans has been growing. This problem is simply the cause of heated politics and divisive policies — or so the media tells us.
Actually, the real issue is the increased presence of religion in American politics and the incredibly dangerous and closed-minded world it is leading us toward.
The Ground Zero Mosque and Obama’s religious affiliation are simplified, eye-catching topics, but the conflict they represent is more complicated than left vs. right. It is clearly about the role of religion in American politics.
If America has separation of church and state, how, when and why did religion become a left-right issue?
Stories where politics, religion and culture clashed have become enormous media and political events. Take, for example, plans for an Islamic cultural center to be built within blocks of the World Trade Center site.
The Cordoba House became a point for debate about how the rest of post-Sept. 11 America engaged with Muslim-Americans.
A small-time pastor from Florida incited everyone when he announced “International Burn-A-Quran Day.”
The public did not celebrate, reaffirming a national sense of religious nonviolence.
But other recent headlines, and our collective focus on them, suggest that some fear still bubbles underneath the cultural surface — and that it’s boiling over the political hotpot.
The United States is in conflict with religiously motivated extremist groups overseas, but what religiously motivated conflicts are happening within its borders and among its citizens?
Is it possible to separate religion from politics?
As the battle for the Republican nomination for president heats up, more attention is being paid to Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) and Gov. Rick Perry (R-Texas). These two presidential hopefuls are using their religious inclination to garner support.
Bachmann and Perry aren’t just devout; both supposedly have ties to a fringe fundamentalist movement known as Dominionism, which states that Christians have the God-given right to rule institutions. Both Bachmann and Perry have taken beliefs from Dominionism, according to a Daily Beast article, and put into action the idea that the American government should be a Christian theocracy based around a fundamentalist interpretation of Scripture.
If either one of these candidates is elected, they could transform America into a country that emphasizes religion even more than it does now.
Fundamentalist Christians share a belief that this country’s problems are rooted in secularism and have resorted to scare tactics and religious fervor that set the nation on a course of oppression and imposition of their religious passion.
Religious fundamentalism of any kind is dangerous.
America could easily slip into a theocracy and all the players are nearly in place to make it a reality.
For years, most Americans  maintained the belief that Christian fundamentalists as harmless, despite somewhat radical religious beliefs. As they become more powerful politically, that belief has slightly changed.
Views such as Creationism, the outlawing of contraception and gay marriage could become more widespread.
It has led to an increasing divide, and unless those who disagree with the Evangelists choose to voice their opinion, they could eventually live in an even more religious America — one that they might not be happy with.
 
Kelly Speca is a junior majoring in narrative studies. 
Stopped reading at, “If America has separation of church and state, how, when and why did religion become a left-right issue?
America has separation of church and state?, or America does not have separation of church and state??.  I can’t get past the poor writing, but in any event, I have some suggestions.
First of all, “If America has separation of church and state…” does not make sense.  But beyond that poor writing, I believe you should look in the Constitution and find the separation of church and state clause and show us.  You made a statement based on a non-fact.
The fact is that America does not have separation of church and state, (as much as I hate your sentence fragment) because it is not in the Constitution.
It is obvious you did not look it up before you wrote this, which explains why you staked your opinion based on a falsehood.
What America has is freedom of religion.  What that means is that the state cannot make you adhere to any one religion.  It prevents an establishment of religion by the state, which was extremely important to Americans who knew that England and other countries forced it’s people to abide by certain religions.  They could not worship freely.   It also means that it is unconstitutional to forbid others to freely express their religion.
Separation of church and state, is a phrase used in a letter written by Jefferson to a Baptist group.  Look it up, then try writing with authority on the subject.
Here, I’ll help you…  http://www.usconstitution.net/jeffwall.html
Please rewrite with some EVIDENCE. Citing speculation from a website is not EVIDENCE.
I agree. Less hyperbole and fewer childish statements.  
For example:
“America could easily slip into a theocracy and all the players are nearly in place to make it a reality.” 
By far one of the most perversely and embarrassingly uninformed lines I have ever read in the Daily Trojan.  
Perhaps the author, with her lofty yet inaccurate statements about the role of religion in politics, is too young to remember or understand the role faith has played in our country’s history, including our civil rights movement.  I’m sure Martin Luther King Jr. would take offense to this piece.
I agree with the author’s sentiments that it is important to consider Bachman and Perry’s religious stances as they want religion to govern politics.  The author is saying that these EXTREME beliefs are dangerous to any democratic society, point in case Iran and Saudi Arabia.
That is exactly what the author is saying.  Extremist views of any kind is the issue,and she was commenting on what has been in the news.
Yes, Stephanie! Extreme beliefs are dangerous, and Christian beliefs are just as scary! Because in all those countries where Christians are stoning women for going out in public without a burqa and hanging gays and… oh, wait… that’s not Christians. My bad.
This is an  opinion piece.  That said isn’t the point here to identify how people bring their belief system into their decision making.  The writer  isn’t making a value judgement about fundamentalism but pointing out that any politician must be vetted in all areas so we can have some idea about how they turn their beliefs into actions.  I’d like to know more about Dominionism before I made any decision about the candidates mentioned in the article. Zealotry is the enemy,it seems that’s what the author is suggesting.
Duncan,
Opinion piece it may be, but opinions about whether religion ought to be in politics or not is a worthwhile topic, and a view on it needs to be defended if it’s to amount to anything worth reading. Among these is the author’s claim that, “the increased presence of religion in American politics and the incredibly dangerous and closed-minded world it is leading us toward.” (This is certainly a value judgment, by the way, but one should have no problem with value judgments, as long as they’re true.) The real problem is that, with respect to her claim, she’s given us no reason to think it is true.
Thanks Duncan! Finally, someone who saw this as an opinion piece.  I applaud the author.
I am a Christian, and though I am by no means perfect, our country was founded on Christian principles, and the word “God” is mentioned and inferred within the constitution. I am NOT aware of anywhere in the Bible which says that we are RUL:E over countries…….. God is the ultimate ruler, NOT us!  and we(Crhistians) RESPECT other viewpoints of religiion,  we don’t chastise them. We can disagree with ways to salvation, but when a country, like ours, deviates away from certain God-led principles which our founding fathers envsiioned, then we are going down a slippery-slope with cultueral views/mores which only lead to more downward-spiraling moral values and beliefs. I am hard-pressed to believe that either Michelle Bachmann or Rick Perry are of the belief that it is their right/manifest destiny to “rule” our country….. there is no pride here, for as Jesus taught, He came here to serve, and likewise, people in authority are to serve with humility, knowing that the privilege is given to them by God, and the ultimate judge of their governing ability is God himself, and to govern fairly, with integrity, and with rspect for others. This to me, is what fundamentalism implies, where the BIble, God’s word , is taken for what it is, God’s revelation to man, and not deviating from it’s teachings………. as opposed to looking at Biblical priniciples and viewing it as changeable based upon the political climate and/or social situation.  LAS 1977
‘Excellent article based on what is happening in the news. The author is not imposing her personal opioion.        I applaud USC for publishing this well written un-biased opinion.  This article did as it was intended,  to get a discussion about the affect of religion on politics and the people who discredit it, seem not to understand at all.  Chosing to worship is a choice we all have as long as government is not involved.  That is the constitution. “Make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,’ thus building a wall of separation between Church & State.” Jefferson reflected his frequent speaking theme that the government is not to interfere with religion or the converse of that religion should not dictate people’s political/secular beliefs.
Do you really think the writers of our Constitution did not use their somewhat various ” religious ” backgrounds to influence what they put down?
Think a moment how America was founded and what was happening in England at the time and what people here wanted for their lives?
I think you are wrong.
PS ” not interfering with religion” also means the government will not proscribe ” a” particular religion as the only religion.
Wow, this is an all time low for the Daily Trojan.  
This person just discredited the religious motivation for the the birthing of this nation (The Declaration of Independence), Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement, and William Wilberforce and the end of slavery in Britain. 
I think the writer should in fact thank Christianity for fighting for humans rights and equality.
The United States Constitution rules out a theocracy. And Christian doctrine has never permitted a theocracy. So what exactly is the problem supposed to be with one’s knowledge (including religious knowledge) informing one’s political commitments? We’re not told (never are), but one gets the sense the problem is merely that there are people who disagree with those political commitments–particularly those of pro-life and pro-traditional marriage. But so what? This is why we vote, after all. Religious, non-religious, and atheist candidates are free to do the same, and more power to them. But it’s hardly the case that the non-religious view is somehow more politically neutral or objective than the “religious” one.  This is why, in America, all sides are permitted in the public square, and can argue their views, and can even persuade others to make policy decisions based on those views.
It seems that USC must really be hurting for journalists these days to post something like this.  
If you have to scrape the bottom of the barrel, please discard the waste instead of letting it pretend it has the ability to write.
I agree.  Quality over quantity DT!!!
Highly uninformed piece, bordering on hysterical, and a discredit to USC students in general. What the hell is narrative studies, anyway? Something that causes one’s critical thinking skills to shrivel up and die? 
“America could easily slip into a theocracy and all the players are nearly in place to make it a reality.”
Uh – WTF. As another commenter pointed out, we have a CONSTITUTION, honey.
It’s honestly an embarrassment to our school.  It’s one thing to make the case that politicians shouldn’t flaunt their religious beliefs, but this is borderline idiotic.  Theocracy?  Is the writer even in college?
Someone help enlighten me, over all my political science courses I have ever taken I never realized a religious president could turn our country into a theocracy. In all seriousness, a theocracy would never be created as it would need the help of Congress. The president could be a child of a Cardinal, a Rabbi or an Imam and he or she could not make it a theocracy if he or she tried. I’m concerned by the dominionism beliefs but only so far as the ethics of it on a personal level. America will be fine, regardless of the religious preferences or tendencies of the President.
Religion and politics are strange bed fellows. Religion should be kept out of politics. How many politicians are influenced by their religious beliefs rather than look at issues objectively.
we are all influenced by external events not just religion and politics. The sum of our thinking is based upon internal and external thought.
Objectiveness is based on whom we choose to believe, and when it comes to politics, politicians have a bad track record. With religious thought we have a past record of infallibility to start with an any failing is more than suspect.
God has claimed certain promises about himself, His nature and His power to do what ever He purposes.
You cannot take religion and politics separately with out dumbing down your brain or in the worst case lying to yourself.
My Bibles  first statement says.. ” In the beginning God”. So to have a true discussion of all that follows one should determine and decide, is there a God, How do we find out about Him, and why did He create us? What follows is determining why would He want a relationship with us and what are consequences of not having a relationship.
It’s not the case that holding a religious view somehow robs someone of objectivity, nor is it the case that denying or withholding judgment on a religious belief is necessary for maintaining objectivity. The content of one’s belief and the ability to think objectively stand in no logical relationship to one another.
So can I assume this writer also deplores the mixture of religion and politics that led to the civil rights movement?
The writer is not learned enough to know that connection.
If the intro had featured, e.g., reactions to Gov. Perry or ex-Gov. Palin, instead of “The Ground Zero Mosque and Obama’s religious affiliation  . . .”  the referenced incidents might possibly have been construed as being “about the role of religion in American politics”.
Manifestations  of the Muslim culture and Islamic symbols are perceived negatively because they represent events and tendencies that are, indeed, nothing but negative.  .
You all have it wrong.
The divisiveness of using religion as an argument is the problem. I will assume ( sorry) most people who think if they go to church or synagogue they have religion. ( I have left mosques out on purpose as I am not versed in  Islam) ,
Going  to a house of worship does not make you a Jew or Christian any more than sitting in a garage makes you an
automobile.
The Bible ( old and new testament) talks about faith, especially points out as ” having the faith of Abraham” which simplistically put is ” believing in the promises of God.
What politicians have done is to TAKE GOD OUT OF EVERY DAY LIFE.  to please some small minority, which has left our country a Godless country.
For those who care, I suggest you read 2nd Chronicles 7:14 to see what needs to be done.
Dont blame religion, blame people.
We send our children to schools, but we lock God out.
James’ “comment” actually makes her case. It’s the arrogant self-righteousness, rather than engagement in discussion and reason, that is the point of the piece. And “offensive”? Why is everybody “offended” by an argument? And which part is “uninformed”? I actually do not agree with the second sentence, including the “generalization” about “the media.” If it mattered to her point — and I’m not sure it does — we might have a discussion about that. But it seems NOT a coincidence that the most zealous religious believers are also the most belligerent, intolerant and uninformed political advocates. Kelly’s piece made you think about that, agree or not. James response was just, um, pretentious and uninformative and amounts to one big generalization.
Neil, wake up,
Self righteousness is the opposite of what is called  fundamentalism. Self righteousness means we can do it ourselves thru our good works.
Try Ephesians 2:8-9 and tell me that a person can be self righteous and godly at the same time.
You are dead wrong.
As far as being politically informed, that is a matter of choice, sometimes education, and sometimes disgust.
Listen to MSNBC and FOX and its like being on two different planets, I find it almost ludicrous.
Lastly you generalize about groups, with out showing any facts to back up your statements which loses credulity in my opinion.
What a pretentious, presumptuous, and uninformed piece.  It’s actually disturbing how offensive this is. 
Why? Why would you make such broad generalities and assumptions?
