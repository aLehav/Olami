The setup: With Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott in attendance, USC hosted Utah in the first ever Pac-12 conference football game. The Utes began their transition from the Mountain West, and their fans showed up in droves to the Coliseum. Former USC offensive coordinator Norm Chow, now Utah’s offensive coordinator, made his return to the Coliseum, where he experienced so much success. In addition, redshirt senior tailback Marc Tyler returned to the USC lineup after an indefinite suspension in the offseason.
The story: USC had several chances to take a commanding lead, but turnovers and penalties negated some of their most promising drives. Utah hung tough, and the game came down to the wire.  The ending could not have been any more bizarre.
With 6:20 remaining, John White ran it one yard to give the Utes a touchdown and make the score 17-14.  Still down by three, Utah regained possession with 1:01 to play. On fourth and ten, Wynn found DeVonte Christopher for a gain of ten, and it was originally ruled a turnover on downs after a measurement.
Upon further review, officials re-spotted the ball and gave life to Utah by awarding a first down. Pass-interference was later called on Tony Burnett, putting the ball well within field-goal range. With no timeouts left, Utah quickly rushed their field-goal unit out and attempted to tie the game.  Offensive lineman Matt Kalil then blocked the kick with his forearm, and Torin Harris scooped it up and ran it in for a touchdown.
However, the referees initially said that because the USC bench stormed on to the field before the game ended, an unsportsmanlike conduct was called and nullified the touchdown from Harris, ending the game at 17-14.  Roughly two hours after the game, the Pac-12 office awarded the touchdown to USC, thus changing the final score to 23-14.
“It did kind of seem like forever” coach Lane Kiffin told reporters after the game. “We’re playing really well in all phases of the game. We’re just not putting people away”.
Getting defensive: Other than the crazy ending, the story of this game was USC’s defensive effort. The Trojans gave up just 319 yards and collected a couple of sacks on the day. Despite the offense putting them in bad positions, the defense was able to maintain its composure, especially down the stretch.
Getting offensive: Although the running game got back on track with Marc Tyler’s 100+ yards, the offense still looked out of sync. Quarterback Matt Barkley is still struggling to find options outside of Robert Woods, although Marqise Lee and Xavier Grimble showed some bright flashes.
USC has only scored 36 points in its first two contests, compared with 66 a year ago. Barkley threw for 264 yards, a touchdown and an interception on the day. The running game improved from last week , and Marc Tyler knew that he had to put the weight on his shoulders.
“This is something I’ve dreamed about doing since I got in trouble, just coming back and being a big impact to the fans and my teammates,” Tyler said after the game. Tyler’s return, however, meant far less snaps for the other tailbacks. Curtis McNeal only had two carries, and D.J. Morgan had eight. Baxter chipped in with one carry of his own. While the tailback situation seems to have been cleared up a bit, the offensive efficiency and ability to put up points remains an issue.
Freshman delivers: Andre Heidari made all of his kicks on the day, including a 47-yard field goal and two extra points.
Next up: The Trojans play host for the third weekend in a row as Syracuse visits the L.A. Coliseum on Saturday, Sept. 17 at 5 p.m.at the Coliseum.

The recent off-campus shooting has caused increased student concern over security west of Vermont Avenue, even after the university added an estimated $3 million in increased security to the area last spring.
Safety · The security measures, implemented last spring, were the university’s first effort to bring security ambassadors and cameras to the area west of Vermont Avenue. - Daily Trojan file photo
Last Sunday two USC students were shot off-campus on the 1200 block of West 37th Place. The two students were hospitalized but are expected to fully recover. The suspect has not been caught.
Seventy-two video patrol cameras, 50 license plate recognition cameras and 13 new security ambassadors were added to the area to better protect students and residents living west of Vermont Avenue, said to Dept. of Public Safety Chief Carey Drayton.
The area west of campus was only patrolled regularly by DPS before last year’s update.
Despite the recent addition of security ambassadors and cameras, many students on the west side of campus said they still do not feel safe in the area.
“The university pays the least attention to this area,” said Sullivan Brown, a junior majoring in animation and digital art who lives on the 1200 block of West 37th Place. “It’s because this is one of the few areas around campus where more locals live in the area than students.”
Brown said he has noticed the new security cameras placed throughout the west side of campus and the presence of yellow jacket security officers but said it was not enough to keep the west side of campus safe.
“The yellow jacket watchers have not been proactive,” Brown said. “Adding security cameras and yellow jackets to the area is clearly not enough to keep us safe.”
Local residents living near where the shooting occurred expressed dissatisfaction with security in the area.
“The [DPS] patrols definitely lack on the west side of campus,” said Oscar Hernandez, a 13-year resident of West 37th Place. “The cameras seem to work but the [DPS] patrols aren’t on this side of campus [very often].”
Wesley Houng, a graduate student studying mechanical engineering who lives on the north side of campus, said he frequently visits the west side and that the area around West 37th Place is not as safe as the area north of campus.
“I don’t really feel protected [on the west side],” Houng said. “There is more of a police presence to the north of campus.”
Vice President of Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson said the best way for students to stay safe is to assist DPS in its efforts to keep the area surrounding USC secure.
“We encourage students to take precautions and take note of suspicious behavior they see,” Jackson said.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said students play a direct role in their own safety.
“There’s always a problem when there’s a private party in a private residence,” Carlisle said. “And [DPS] can’t help those inside [the residence].”
It so funny to me that when DPS does something “bad” in students eyes, they have 20 comments regarding the matter, but when they actually do something good as in catching a criminal THERE ARE NO COMMENTS. Oh and by the way USC housing suggest that you live north of USC, everyone knows  that west of USC is not the best area, so why would you put yourself in that type of situation to begin with then expect DPS to be sitting outside your door every time you leave home. I personally called regarding this article. DPS told me that they have a minimum of 2 officers patrolling the area at all times. Plus CSC there until 2am. They also just installed cameras in most of the intersections west of USC. What more do you want! The fact that the DP only interviewed 2 people and one lives in the area is really disturbing to me. How about you DT, drive around the area and see how the security is yourself. 
As much as people complain about their safety it seems that most of the person crimes that occur is due to the students lack of personal responsibility. Walking alone at 2am from class, leaving their computer unattended in a computer lab while you leave for 2 hours and hopes that it will still be their when you get back, getting so drunk that you leave your friends and try and find your way home. (even though there is a tram that takes you home from 6pm-3am and cruiser that runs until 6am). Walking with your cell phone in your hands not paying attention to your surroundings. Letting people in to your party that you don’t know, getting so drunk that your passed out in someones yard. Take some responsibility for your own actions, for your own safety.
DPS is there to ensure that we have a safe and fun 4 years of college here at USC! Their the first people that we blame when something is not going our way or we are not satisfied with a situation that we usually put ourselves into, but the first people we call for help. How about showing them a little more respect for the jobs that their doing. I want to thank them for the jobs that they are doing. And I think that you reading this should too.
what happened to the other 5+ comments on this article??
For $3mil the locals have been replaced by Pikes who take our cans and bottles out of the recycle bin
The “west side” gets a lot of crap from students, and it’s sad to see that the Daily Trojan has jumped on the bandwagon as well. Nikias announced the new security last spring, but said it wouldn’t be in place until the start of this school year. So after a grand total of three weeks, and after talking to a grand total of two students (only one of which lives on the west side) the area’s been deemed dangerous yet again.
How’s this for some news: I’ve lived on the west side for three years and have never had a problem. A lot of my other housemates/neighbors will say the same. Too many students refuse to look past their north side bubble, and it’s disappointing that the DT is doing the same.

Students said they were pleased to see speakers urge them to strive for interfaith unity at the Remembering 9/11: Ten Years Later ceremony held in Bovard Auditorium on Sunday.
Ceremony · Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villariagosa said Los Angeles, as one of the most diverse cities in the world, needed its residents to be a beacon of hope for global tolerance, especially during difficult times. - George Chearswat | Daily Trojan
Speakers included Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, President C. L. Max Nikias, Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni and Undergraduate Student Government President Monish Tyagi. They spoke about the impact of the attack on the country and the national interfaith community service initiative being launched at USC to help spread awareness and tolerance of other cultures.
“9/11 has been thought of as a national day of service, but at USC, we envision the 10-year anniversary of 9/11 as a year of service,” Soni said. “We anticipate that students who have personal experiences with those of other faith traditions will come to appreciate the common goals and shared aspirations that connect us as human beings.”
Students not involved with interfaith initiatives said they were pleased to hear about USC’s drive to promote understanding.
Nicole Baffa, a junior majoring in political science, said she was happy the university was sending a message of unity.
“I think its great that USC is not focusing on the impact of the event only, but more the remedy and forward actions,” Baffa said. “It’s important that we move forward and join rather than polarize ideologies.”
Andrea Lawler, a sophomore majoring in electrical engineering and writing for screen and television, said the program was necessary for harmony in the community.
“I’m surprised it hadn’t been started since 9/11,” Lawler said. “The interfaith program really helps us to be a cohesive community and learn from our mistakes in order to fight this tragedy.”
Student members of the Interfaith Council said their experiences within the program were gratifying and informative. Robby Mack, a sophomore majoring in political science, said his work with the interfaith council exposed him to ideas not present at his high school.
“The interfaith program is the only place where I feel I can develop as a person within the Trojan family,” Mack said. “I came from a heavily conservative school and the program is one of the only groups that allows questioning of such topics in an educational environment.”
The Interfaith Council’s work is promoted by Nikias, who said USC will act as a global model for tolerance.
“I am proud to see that, in addition to USC being the country’s most diverse and multicultural school, we are on course to spread the education of people’s cultures and religion as part of a formal education that can truly be applied on a global scale,” Nikias said.
Speakers also said the interfaith aspect of the initiative is key to the school’s general plan to promote tolerance and understanding nationwide.
“Religion is unquestionably powerful force in the world,” said USC Religious Director Imam Jihad Turk. “Through this initiative, it is hoped that we can demonstrate that power of religion can be harnessed to be a power for the common good.”
Tyagi stressed the United States needed to move on from the tragedy of Sept. 11 and that USC must take similar actions to make sure such events do not occur again.
“To heal the 9/11 wound, we need to put the event in the past but not forget it,” Tyagi said. “We must understand it so we can work towards solving the hatred and misunderstanding by means of interfaith promotion.”
Villaraigosa said USC and the greater Los Angeles community were more cohesive following the attacks because of the remarkable reaction of the American people and students.
“Hope, resilience, love — these things were all demonstrated by the American people following the attacks to show the world that we are now more united than we were before,” Villaraigosa said.

Twenty minutes after the USC women’s soccer team’s 2-1 loss to Texas on Sunday, USC coach Ali Khosroshahin sat motionless on his team’s bench, trying to comprehend what he just watched. The Women of Troy had been 10 minutes away from their first home win of the season. Ten minutes away from pitching their first shutout of the season. Things can change quickly.
Scoring drought · Sophomore midfielder Autumn Altamirano provided the Women of Troy their lone goal of the weekend set, scoring in the 33rd minute Sunday against Texas. USC eventually fell in double overtime. - Jaideep Chadha | Daily Trojan
Twelve minutes into overtime, Texas forward Vanessa Ibewuike knocked a goal into the right corner with such precision that USC sophomore goalie Shelby Church could only watch.
When the ball hit the back of the net, there was eruption from the Longhorn sideline. There was only silence from the USC sideline.
It wasn’t indifference. It was shock. For some 80 minutes, the Women of Troy (3-5) dominated Texas (6-2), doubling the Longhorns’ shot total in the first half.
In the 34th minute, a point-blank rocket by sophomore midfielder Autumn Altamirano put the Women of Troy up 1-0.
Freshman midfielder Elizabeth Caparis — streaking down the right sideline — centered the ball to junior forward Samantha Johnson. Johnson put it on net, and the rebound came right to Altamirano, who fired it home.
As the minutes ticked away, Texas poured on the pressure. Playing with three forwards instead of the usual two, they forced corner after corner, and the USC defense could do nothing but clear the ball downfield. Church was forced to make a sensational diving save on a Longhorn free kick. The breakthrough was inevitable, and in the 80th minute, it happened.
In what Khosroshahin referred to as a “defensive breakdown,” the Women of Troy conceded a free kick to Texas. The result was a mad scramble directly in front of the USC goal, and the ball in the end was headed over Church and into the USC goal.
“We can’t keep letting down in the back,” Khosroshahin said. “Our back-third defense was solid the whole game, but when you play teams like this they’re gonna capitalize if you give them an opportunity.”
After that, the game changed. Texas threatened countless times in the last 10 minutes of regulation, while USC appeared lifeless. The Women of Troy recorded just one shot the rest of the game to the Longhorn’s five. If there was going to be a winner, it was going to be Texas.
“You can’t really put emotions into words after a game like this,” senior midfielder Ashli Sandoval said. “It’s just unexplainable.”
USC’s game on Friday was similarly disappointing, outplaying No. 4 Oklahoma State but falling 1-0.
“I don’t even know what to say,” senior midfielder Carly Butcher said. “We’re keeping the ball. We just didn’t put it in. And we can’t let down and let them get one, because it’s hard to come back.”
Khosroshahin expressed similar frustration.
“I don’t know what to think,” he said. “I know we’re getting better. We just gotta finish our opportunities.”
Best wishes to the team as the journey to Portland this weekend. 
Putting the two defenders back in the midfield could help but looking at the roster the team is made up of primarily midfielders anyway.  We dominated,  had a lot of shots, but the goals were inevitable based on what I saw of our backline.  One spark plug who was putting in work defending, #11. The two defenders in the middle were nonchalant and lacked a sense of urgency.  The other defender had nothing in the speed department and kept getting burned.  Only one player commanded the midfield, #5. The rest of the midfield didn’t and hasn’t shown up yet. I say until they do put other players in.  #16 came in, kept it simple, stayed on her feet, no flopping, falling or grabbing antics, played clean, kept going, ran down balls, didn’t give up and made a difference. Our goalkeeper had some great saves too.  Come on SC we can’t lose another home game.
Another coach in over his head. He won a national title his first year with the previous coach’s players and even
though he makes the playoffs gets eliminated in the 1st or 2nd round yearly. He needs to take some lessons from
the water polo coach Jovan in recruiting.
Our women’s soccer team is in trouble and should not be.  I watched Sunday’s game. They played well and it was their best game at home this season.  It looks like they were in a 1-5-4.  One forward?  The other team started with two forwards then pushed up a third  to create more scoring chances and it worked.  Our team didn’t make the adjustment.  Just stayed the same.  
Put our top two scorers from last year back in the midfield where they belong and off of defense.  It looks like the team is close to 30 girls and no one else can play defense?  I have a player from the team in my class. She’s always enthusiastic, promoting the team and encouraging students to come out and support them. The coach needs to start cutting the dead weight on the team and give their scholarships to people who want to do the work.

Despite rain and muddy terrain, the USC women’s cross-country team was off and running Saturday with a seventh-place finish at the UC Irvine Invitational. The five-kilometer race was the first official collegiate meet for eight of USC’s 10 runners.
Junior Shelby Buckley, expected to be one of USC’s top runners this season, finished first among the Women of Troy and 19th overall with a time of 18:17.4. After transferring from UCLA in 2009 and sitting out with an injury last season, Buckley saw the race as a learning experience for future races.
“I would say it was a good starting point for myself,” Buckley said. “I’m happy that I was able to gauge where I am in my training and now I can improve upon that in both practice and races.”
USC coach Tom Walsh was proud of the effort he saw from the team, most of which was racing for the first time in college.
“It was pretty good first race of the season for the USC cross-country team,” Walsh said. “The freshmen were a little nervous, but they got that first race as a Trojan under their belt. I was pleased with how the girls finished the race.”
By selecting an invitational meet in which USC was the only Pac-12 team as the first of the season, Walsh allowed the team’s five newest members to compete. His hopes for the team’s five freshmen were realized, with Erin Robinson finishing in 18:54.3 for 40th place. Shannon Byrne posted a personal record of 18:55.2 to take 43rd, with fellow freshman Kira Soderstrom finishing in 57th. The freshman group was rounded out with Erin Matranga and Austin Lundin finishing in 69th and 78th, respectively.
“The first race in your collegiate career is always nerve-racking, so I think they are relieved that they got that race under their belts,” Buckley said.
USC was missing one of its anticipated stars, freshman Erica Capellino, who will run her first race for the Women of Troy next weekend at the San Diego State Aztec Invitational. Despite her absence, Walsh was pleased with his team’s performance, although he noted there are areas to grow.
“Every one of our runners had a strong kick at the end of the race,” Walsh said. “But we need some improvement on our middle-of-the-race tactics. We were not aggressive enough in the middle.”
The team finished seventh behind Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Azusa Pacific, Long Beach State, Cal State San Marcos, Claremont McKenna and UC San Diego, in a field of sixteen teams.
“I would say this meet was a good starting point, especially for our freshmen,” Buckley said.

Senior running back Marc Tyler made his season debut Saturday as the Trojans defeated Utah 23-14, carrying the ball 24 times for 113 yards and a touchdown. But the workload came within the flow of the game, according to the coaching staff.
“I thought it would probably be a Marc Tyler-type of game,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “I knew he wouldn’t start, but I thought by the end of it he’d have more carries.”
Tyler, who received 69 percent of the carries Saturday, was USC’s most effective back averaging 4.7 yards per carry. Redshirt freshman running back D.J. Morgan started the game, but after fumbling in the second quarter, Morgan did not receive another touch the rest of the game.
Instead, Kiffin went with Tyler for the majority of the game, with sophomore Dillon Baxter and redshirt junior Curtis McNeal spelling him throughout.
“Two things happened: It was that type of game … and with D.J. putting the ball on the ground, that obviously made it easy at that time that we were going to go with Marc and Dillon,” Kiffin said.
USC’s next game is Saturday, against Syracuse. No starting running back has been announced for next week’s game.

Special teams coordinator John Baxter’s unit gave USC a lift once again.
After freshman kicker Andre Heidari only saw one extra point attempt in the season opener against Minnesota, Heidari kicked two extra points and his first field goal attempt — a 47-yarder — which he made.
Though he struggled later in the game, freshman punter Kyle Negrete’s punts never resulted in a scoring drive for the Utes.
The biggest moment occurred on the last play of scrimmage. After a review of the ball’s spot, Utah drew a defensive passing interference that put it in range for a 41-yard field goal at USC’s 24-yard line.
On the kick, redshirt junior offensive tackle Matt Kalil stuck his arm up and blocked the kick with his forearm. Redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris recovered the ball and returned it 69 yards for a touchdown as time expired.
Originally the points did not count because of an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty committed by USC as the team on the sideline rushed the field when Harris returned the ball. The Pac-12, however, reversed the call after the game.
—
Coming off a record-breaking performance, sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods finished with eight receptions for 102 yards, but no touchdowns.
As with Woods, junior quarterback Matt Barkley completed 20 passes on 32 attempts for 264 yards, one touchdown and an interception.
The USC defense constantly harassed junior Utah quarterback Jordan Wynn throughout the game. Wynn only completed 50 percent of his throws on 46 attempts, was sacked twice and hurried multiple times by Trojan defenders.
The Trojan defense turned in another solid performance, as it allowed 319 yards but only 81 yards on 25 attempts — just 3.2 yards per carry — and 14 points.
[…] Perhaps my biggest beef with this article is just how uncreative it is. It makes a big deal out of nothing, when there were so many interesting stories that could have been discussed. It was Utah’s first Pac-12 game. The ending was insane. Vegas blew up because there was a penalty that could have negated the touchdown. Instead people chose to focus on Marc Tyler. […]

In USC’s bid to make history as a program, it was senior driver Peter Kurzeka who made history himself.
Record setting · Senior driver Peter Kurzeka’s (right) six goals against Cal Baptist were the most by a Trojan in a single game since 2001. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
In USC’s home opener Saturday, Kurzeka scored six goals to lead the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team to a 14-3 victory over No. 18 Cal Baptist. It was the most goals scored by a Trojan in a single game since 2001.
The six goals place Kurzeka in a tie for No. 22 on USC’s all-time scoring list. Kurzeka, however, chose not to put too much emphasis on the feat.
“I couldn’t care less really,” Kurzeka said. “We’ve won three championships in a row and we’re trying to win another one. Right now, I’m not worried about how I compare to some of those other great players.”
Even when Cal Baptist had possession of the ball, USC’s aggressive play proved too much for the Lancers. The Trojans allowed just one goal through the first three periods, shutting down Cal Baptist in the second and third periods.
“We really have a good goalie in the cage, which made things more difficult for the opponent,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “They were hesitant to take shots. Our one-on-one defense was great, and we stayed with them and took away the goal-side drives more often than not.”
After taking a 2-0 lead on goals by Kurzeka and redshirt sophomore driver Stephen Siri, USC surrendered a power play goal to the Lancers. Cal Baptist would not score again until the fourth quarter when USC sat out most of the players in its regular 13-player rotation.
“Everybody did a great job,” Vavic said. “[Freshman driver Konstantinos Genidounias], our addition from Greece, had a great game. [Senior two-meter Matt] Burton had a good game defensively. Obviously, [Kurzeka] scored six goals which is an incredible effort, and [sophomore driver] Nikola [Vavic] made some nice moves, scored three goals and made some nice assists.”
Genidounias and sophomore two-meter Jeremy Davie missed the first match against Fresno Pacific because they were competing against each other in the FINA Men’s Junior World Championships bronze medal game in Volos, Greece. Despite missing weeks of practice, neither player missed a beat in his season debuts,  Vavic said.
The match allowed many of the USC underclassmen to log playing time. Though they surrendered two goals and did not muster much offense, they hung in well against the Cal Baptist starters.
“The [younger players] have a ways to go, but they’re finally understanding the system,” Kurzeka said. “They have the effort and the drive, but it just takes time. It’s a tough system to learn right off the bat, and Vavic is a tough coach who expects a lot.”
This weekend, USC heads to Stockton, Calif., to defend its 2010 title in the NorCal tournament.

Among a record crowd of 5,385 fans, one could actually hear the groans coming from the Galen Center in between each of USC’s unforced errors.
Swept · Senior middle blocker Lauren Williams, left, and senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter, right, were upended by No. 8 UCLA in straight sets. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
No. 8 UCLA capitalized on every single mistake, every single error and swept No. 9 USC in three sets, 19-25, 17-25, and 17-25.
“Quite honestly, our team didn’t play well,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “We didn’t execute well, and it was disappointing the way we seemed to give up.”
The Women of Troy (5-3, 0-1) could not get into a rhythm, struggling to consistently string together any type of offense. Senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter finished with nine kills, although she also had seven errors and senior middle blocker Lauren Williams finished with eight kills but committed six errors. Sophomore libero Natalie Hagglund finished with 17 digs.
Led by the play of UCLA senior setter Lauren Van Orden, who finished with 32 assists, six digs and four kills, the Bruins capitalized on USC’s mistakes.
“We certainly lost both the serving game and the passing game,” Haley said. “We violated our fundamentals, which are not to give points to the other team. We gave way too many free points.”
Haley pointed to the third game as a microcosm for the entire match, where things looked like they could turn in favor of the Women of Troy. In the end, however, they did not.
“We missed the opportunity in the third game, when we broke their momentum and neutralized it,” Haley said. “We should have been ready to take advantage of that, [but we didn’t] recognize it.”
The schedule doesn’t get much easier for the Women of Troy, either, as they face the No. 5 Washington next week on the road.
“We have to work very hard on the serving and passing game,” Haley said. “Our blocking is really not good right now … That’s what we’ve been working on, and it didn’t show tonight. We have to look at how we’re getting after it. If we need to change, we need to change, but we have a lot of work to do.”
Haley did see a few positives following their performance.
“I got a lot of the freshmen into the match,” he said. “And in this kind of a situation, I would hope they would grow from that … We’re just going to have to get tougher.”
The Women of Troy are playing more freshmen than the coaching staff anticipated, as Haley believes that since a lot of the games weren’t close towards the end, it made sense to put in younger players to help them develop.
The Women of Troy take on Washington in Seattle on Sept. 16 at 7 p.m. and Washington State on Sept. 17.
I was also stunned by our subpar play. I Love Coach Haley and the program, yet this match was super disappointing.  Loss of Falyn & Alex is huge. Coach Paula’s absence also showing. I thought Natalie played great. Kendall was consistent. Poor Blocking and not hitting through and around blocks continue to cripple our chances.  Too many service errors lost game one. “Babes In Troyland” need to Focus on fundamentals!!
Fight On, we got your back.  A 2-2 in next 4 matches would be a good start.
It was pathetic to say the least. Being held under twenty pts. in each set playing at home with the large crowd including the most students ever to attend a volleyball match. It really hurt losing Falyn F. to academics and
Alex Olgard to surgery recovery before the season started. Recruiting is subpar getting only one Fab 50 player this year while some of the other conf. schools adding two or three. The coaching staff not the same since Paula
Weisshoff left to become a head coach a couple of years ago. Looking at three losses in the next two weekends vs. UW, Cal, and Stanford which could demoralize the team for the rest of the season.

It happened, again.
It wasn’t pretty. It was hardly palatable.
For the second week in a row, USC won a game in the final seconds, barely, edging Utah in the first-ever Pac-12 game.
Based on games one and two, living on the edge might serve as an appropriate slogan for the 2011 Trojans. Living on a prayer might even be more fitting.
But it counts, technically. USC is still 2-0, sitting atop the Pac-12 South standings, undefeated heading into a home contest against unranked Syracuse in week three.
“Wins like this can sometimes be really special,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said in the moments following the Trojans’ 23-14 victory over the Utes.
But the Cardiac Kiffins again needed a game-changing play in the waning minutes. No longer could they coast comfortably to a two-touchdown rout. No longer could they even win by a double-digit margin, as they have so many times over the past decade.
This is USC, this season at least. Just good enough, and that’s a disturbing thought with 10 games remaining on the slate.
It was exhilarating, sure, but it hardly warranted being dubbed special. If USC is scouring for a recipe for success, this isn’t it. Not by a mile.
It shouldn’t have been close. It shouldn’t have been within 10 points.
USC had plenty of chances to win comfortably, but it couldn’t pile it on, not in the second quarter, and not in the second half.
Despite running out to quick 10-0 lead on a six-yard Marc Tyler touchdown run, junior quarterback Matt Barkley threw an interception on the subsequent drive while fielding the snap from the Utah 21-yard line.
Later in the second quarter, redshirt freshman tailback D.J. Morgan fumbled at the Utah 16-yard line before the Utes went on to drive 84 yards for a late touchdown.
There went two scores — a 21-point swing.
USC would turn it over again in the third quarter— a fumble from freshman tight end Xavier Grimble one play after the Trojans stopped the Utes on a fake punt on fourth down.
Fortunately, for the 70,000-plus cardinal-clad fans in attendance, Utah couldn’t capitalize either, failing to score in the final period.
USC had three turnovers. It also had seven penalties for 54 yards. It seemingly did everything in its power to hand Utah a victory.
Talk about failed two-point conversions last week concealed one glaring pimple: USC can’t close — at least not now.
It couldn’t close when it led 10-0.
It couldn’t close when it led 10-7.
It couldn’t close when it led 17-7, either.
It let Utah stick around, and if Coleman Petersen’s 41-yard field goal attempt didn’t hit junior left tackle Matt Kalil’s forearm on the final play, there might have been overtime at the Coliseum on Saturday night.
“Luckily I’m a tall guy,” said the 6-foot-7 Kalil with a grin.
But Kalil’s arm length won’t be enough.
It won’t be enough when the Trojans travel to Tempe, Ariz., to face an Arizona State team, which is now 2-0 after a win over then-No. 21 Missouri.
It won’t be enough when it hosts Heisman Trophy frontrunner Andrew Luck and Stanford on Halloween weekend.
It certainly won’t be enough for a late season road trip to Autzen Stadium, where they haven’t won since 2005.
USC shouldn’t need to stave off a Minnesota team that won just three games a season ago. A Minnesota team that lost 28-21 on Saturday at home to New Mexico State.
It shouldn’t need a blocked field goal to beat a Utah team playing in its first Pac-12 conference game.
It can’t afford to leave so little room for error.
No question, Kiffin and company are facing plenty of obstacles this season and in the coming years with roster deflections related to NCAA sanctions and a postseason ban, but in regard to unforced errors, the onus is on them.
Barkley’s second-quarter interception came as a result of senior fullback Rhett Ellison’s failure to break out of a sideline out route.
Morgan’s fumble came as a result of a botched exchange in the backfield with Barkley.
And Grimble’s fumble just, well, happened.
Through two games, the Trojans’ turnover margin stands at minus-two a year after it finished at plus-four.
For a team which boasted a training camp slogan of “That’s our ball,” it hasn’t seemed to take that message to heart thus far in 2011.
If anything, it’s been too careless.
“Freshmen mistakes showed up,” Kiffin said during the post-game press conference. “And unfortunately you can’t have those if you want to put somebody away.”
For a young team with so little margin for error still, it surely can’t.

hi mr. kaufman,
i think you should lower you’re standards a little.  stop comparing them with the bush years and start analyze them based on what we currently have.  take into account how far this team has come from last year.  
this team has a lot of potential, and i think that’s what’s makes this team special this year.  stop moaning about not being able to smash the opponents like that glory days by half time.  that’s getting old.  why not highlight the positives that this team displayed on saturday like finally being able to establish a running game, stopping 11 of utah’s drives (including 4 of 4 in the fourth quarter), dominating the line, incorporating a greater variety of defensive schemes like blitzes, playing more players throughout the game, and actually closing out a game?  
the fan ticket sales are already low because so many writers like you continue to compare these TROJANS to the bush years, and fair-weather fans think they stink.  this team is gonna prove something great this year, even though they’re mostly likely going to lose a few.  but guess what, this team is heading in the right direction.  we still won two games without scoring more than a touchdown in the 4th quarter, and we still won with three turnovers. that’s going to change for the better as the season progresses.
next week’s game is going to be the best of the season, and things are just getting better.  
fight on!

For the second consecutive game this season, the USC defense came up with a stop when it mattered most.
Defensive pressure · Freshman linebacker Hayes Pullard, along with junior defensive end Nick Perry, recorded two sacks against the Utes. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
After an overturned call gave Utah a first down, and a pass interference call moved the Utes into field goal range, Utah brought out the kicking unit to force the game into overtime. Utah kicker Coleman Peterson’s 41-yard attempt was blocked, however, by redshirt junior offensive tackle Matt Kalil and returned for a touchdown by redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris, giving USC a 23-14 win in its Pac-12 opener at the Coliseum.
“I’m excited that it finished this way,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “I’m actually glad the way it happened at the end and I’m proud of our players.”
USC’s defense — a concern coming into the season — held Utah to just 81 yards rushing. USC’s running game, which was almost non existent last weekend, appeared re-energized with the play and return of senior running back Marc Tyler.
“Having a big back like him that can carry the ball all game like he can really helps us,” junior quarterback Matt Barkley said. “He runs the ball really hard. He’s a good back for us and I’m glad he’s back.”
Reinstated last week, Tyler had 24 carries for 113 yards and one touchdown.
“This is something that I dreamed about doing,” Tyler said. “To come back and [make] an impact to the team. I feel like I owed the team, the fans and the coaches.”
Last weekend USC elected to call a pass play more than 45 times of its 73 offensive possessions. On Saturday, the Trojans ran the ball 39 times and attempted 32 passes. Kiffin often elected to rely on the senior Tyler against a strong, experienced Utah front seven.
“I kind of thought it would be that type of game,” Kiffin said. “I thought it would probably be a Marc Tyler type of game, and especially with [redshirt freshman] D.J. Morgan putting the ball on the ground, it made it an easy choice to increase Marc’s carries.”
Tyler’s six-yard run with two minutes remaining in the first quarter gave USC a 10-0 lead, but like last weekend, Utah did just enough to hang around. Or rather, USC allowed the Utes to keep it within striking distance.
A Barkley interception at the Utah 21-yard line did not hurt the Trojans but Morgan’s fumble inside the red zone with just under seven minutes proved costly.
Junior quarterback Jordan Wynn led the Utes on a 12-play, 84-yard scoring drive, connecting with junior wide receiver DeVonte Christopher on a 10-yard pass to cut the USC lead to 10-7 heading into halftime.
The USC defense limited Utah to just 152 yards of total offense in the first half, but 84 of those yards came on Utah’s four-minute scoring drive.
 
Despite finishing scoreless in the second half of last weekend’s season opener, USC responded right away on its first possession of the second half against the Utes. Barkley orchestrated a seven-play, 88-yard drive, finding freshman tight end Xavier Grimble for a 9-yard strike to extend the USC lead to 17-7.
As had been the case in the first half, however, USC would turn the ball over again on its next possession. This time, Grimble fumbled the ball, giving Utah field position at the USC 48-yard line with another chance to capitalize and cut into the lead.
Two plays later, the Utes cut into the Trojans’ lead on junior John White IV’s one-yard touchdown run.
As in last week’s season opener against Minnesota, the USC offense appeared to fall out of rhythm in the second half. After the Grimble touchdown, the Trojans failed to score in the last 24 minutes of the game, leaving the door open for Utah to take advantage.
“We had so many chances to put the game away, but our defense won the game for us,” Barkley said. “They were lights out.”
Two sacks — one by redshirt freshman linebacker Hayes Pullard and one by junior defensive end Nick Perry — halted Utah offensive drives on third-down plays in the fourth quarter. The USC defense limited the Utes to just 5-of-15 on third-down conversions, a stat it struggled with a year ago when it allowed opposing offenses to convert on 44 percent of third-down conversions.
“We got a really good effort from our defense,” Kiffin said. “There are so many questions about this team’s ability to finish. For us to go out there and keep stopping them really gives us something to build on.”
Pac-12 and USC officials changed the score from 17-14 to 23-14 more than two hours after the end of the game, ruling Harris’ touchdown would stand after it was initially negated by an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on the USC sideline.
Next Saturday, USC hosts Syracuse at the Coliseum at 5 p.m.
The student section was amazing at the game! Really made noise, stayed to the end; they made a difference! And I loved how they stayed for half time and rocked and sang with the band! Best student section I have seen at USC in my 15 years of going to the games! Fight On!

From a popular picnic hot spot for upper-crusters, to a gang-infiltrated slum, to a revitalized music festival venue, MacArthur Park, straddling Wilshire Boulevard in Westlake, has experienced many transformations throughout the years.
Cultural medley · MacArthur Park exists as a historical reminder of Los Angeles’ rich yet controversial history — filled with everything from riots and drug wars to cultural hubs and sneak-peaks into foreign countries — and offers denizens an extensive choice of eating options. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
The park’s image has suffered from a bad reputation over the decades but has since sobered up. Take a walk by the lake or recreational fields and you’ll be caught in a crossroad of cultures and multilingual people.
Early mornings, you’ll see Korean grandmas and grandpas brisk-walking or stretching while their younger generations cut through the park to the Red Line Metro station. Midday and evenings, you’ll see a young mother and child feeding ducks and swans, while after-hour workers sprawl out on the grass with bottles of beer and tacos.
Weekends are the most crowded. Food cart vendors blow horns in every corner, Latino protestant evangelists shout “Jesús es tu salvación” into megaphones, screaming kids send flocks of pigeons fluttering and couples walk hand-in-hand in the middle of all the animated chaos.
MacArthur Park might seem like mayhem, but it’s an organized and dynamic one. Visit several more times, and you’ll know exactly what to expect: a rich interaction of people from all backgrounds, cultures and socioeconomic statuses, which is reflected in the diverse mix of ethnic restaurants and food carts surrounding the park.
The most famous restaurant would be Langer’s Deli, the Jewish restaurant so beloved that Langer’s Square is dedicated to it. Like a typical Jewish deli, Langer’s offers a huge menu, but locals know exactly what to order: the No. 19, a multi-layered sandwich of tender, hand-carved pastrami, sharp Swiss cheese, crunchy coleslaw and piquant Russian dressing.
Another popular eatery is Mama’s Hot Tamales Cafe, a quaint hole-in-the-wall restaurant characterized by its bright-colored decor. Located right across the street from the lake, the cafe played a vital role in revitalizing the MacArthur Park neighborhood by hiring and training local residents on culinary business.
Reflecting the influences of its multi-ethnic workers, its menu is a diverse mix of Mexican, Guatemalan, Salvadoran, Colombian, Peruvian and Honduran dishes. Of course, its specialty is tamales, which vary from savory options like chicken mole and beef adobo to sweet desserts like pineapple and guava. Additionally, Mama’s Hot Tamales offers vegan-friendly remakes of most dishes by using Daiya cheese.
Antojitos Bibi on Seventh Street, on the other hand, is better-known for a specific regional cuisine. Other than the familiar antojitos (Mexican tapas), try the exquisite sopa de caracol, a rich, coconut-based broth with chunks of fresh conch meat (Atonjitos Bibi is one of the few Honduran places that doesn’t use canned conch) served with a heap of rice. Or picnic out with baleadas, a popular Honduran street fare. Though it looks like a quesadilla, the flour tortilla folded over refried beans and cheese is thicker and chewier.
For simple, low-key Guatemalan take-out, trot down to Eighth and Alvarado Streets in the evenings. You’ll see after-hour crowds surrounding food carts selling simple Guatemalan fare for a fixed price of $3.50. Most of these vendors don’t speak English, but with some hand gestures and smiles, you can score tasty, authentic meals like fried chicken drumstick with pacaya relleno (palm flower fritters) and Guatemalan chow mein. Also ask for the sopa de pata, a savory beef hoof soup packed with cabbage, chayote and other vegetables.
Half a block down to Ninth Street, you can try out Korean-style blowfish (called “bok-eo”) at Dae Bok Restaurant. Blowfish (also known as fugu) are infamous for the deadly and paralytic poison in their organs, but this homey, family-style restaurant cooks the lethal vertabrae either spicy grilled or in a hearty stew (ji-ri), reimagining its reputation as comfort food.
But there’s more — what about hot-griddled Salvadoran pupusas at Los Molcajetes on Eighth Street? Or fat, overflowing Mexican tortas at Super Tortas on the other end of MacArthur Park?
You don’t even have to leave the park to encounter delicious finds. Food carts will wheel you raspados (Mexican snow cones), fresh-cut fruit in plastic packages or elote (Mexican-style corn on the cob that has been slathered with mayo and margarine and smothered in grated cotija cheese with a sprinkle of chili powder).
MacArthur Park is a surviving battlefield. It has been scarred by racial riots and drug wars, but it is still standing and still collecting stories of the hundreds of people who walk by it daily — tales of human interaction that are revealed through its rich compass of good eats.

There are few words that could appropriately describe Bassnectar’s performance in Hollywood on Friday night.
Turntable tyrant · Bassnectar provided his fans with an amped up array of dazzling drops and hot samples, causing the audience to start an impromptu mosh pit and to headbang much like the electro virtuoso himself. - Photo courtesy of Douglas Wojciechowski
Living up to his reputation as a consummate entertainer and relentless innovator of electronic music, Bassnectar — also known as Lorin Ashton — ravaged the eclectic crowd at the Palladium with a display of electronic mastery, releasing wave after wave of raucous, chest-rumbling tracks into the sold-out auditorium.
Perhaps as a testament to his esteem in the world of electronic dance music, the line, snaking through a parking lot and out onto the sidewalk along Sunset Boulevard, featured everyone and anyone. There were teens in fluorescent fishnets and glittery American Apparel miniskirts; frat bros in tank tops; and older couples, looking bemused and intrigued.
The common thread? Everyone was expecting a memorable show. And the result was nothing short of what everybody was expecting.
Of course, the show didn’t just start with Bassnectar. DJ AmpLive, noted for his remixes and work as a Bassnectar contributor, opened the show with a short, diverse set featuring everything from Tyler the Creator’s “Yonkers” to a rousing remix of Rage Against the Machine’s “Killing in the Name Of.”
Near the end of his set, AmpLive brought out his piece de resistance: a homemade “guitar” with a digital sampling pad as the body and a neck riddled with knobs and buttons, sending the crowd into a fit of excitement.
Electronic duo Big Gigantic stepped up to continue the show. Dominic Lalli and his partner took their places onstage — the former behind a bank of mixers and turntables, with a sax hanging from his neck, and the latter behind a sparkling acoustic drum set.
Saxophones? Drum sets? Not exactly the usual equipment for an EDM show, but Big Gigantic impressed the audience with a fresh, jazz-laced sound that packed a dynamic punch with the addition of live drums. Even this performance was only a hint of what was to come.
It was 11:15 p.m. when the excitement for Bassnectar grew to its breaking point, as the crowd in the historic venue ballooned in wait for the headliner to take the stage. Eventually, Bassnectar arrived, along with his signature flowing locks of dark hair.
“Looking back, I could’ve never imagined a sold-out Palladium crowd in front of me,” he told the crowd, eliciting a roar of approval.
An introductory track of spoken words started the show off, building deliberately and steadily into a last, fleeting second of silence. Then the beat dropped.
“Contained chaos” could describe what happened next, as everyone erupted into a dubstep-induced euphoria. Amid the body-quivering wobbles of bass, audience members celebrated in their own unique ways. Some merely stood in place, gazing in awe at the monstrous assembly of LED light panels onstage that served as Bassnectar’s visual complement. Others sparked an impromptu mosh pit, swinging legs and elbows in a sweat-laced riot of excess energy. And that was just the beginning.
Bassnectar kept the train rolling all night, stepping up the energy and the sheer amount of sound throughout the entirety of his roughly two-hour set. Just when you thought the set couldn’t be any more intense, somehow, someway, he figured out a way to top himself over and over again.
At one point, he mixed in the theme of Hawaii 5-O with the show’s opening sequencing playing along on the massive LED boards onstage. He also dropped in Nirvana, Blur’s famous “Song 2,” a spirited remix of Dev’s popular “Bass Down Low” and, possibly best of all, his remix of English singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding’s “Lights.”
Bassnectar’s performance deftly hybridized numerous genres of electronic music, cementing his conviction to unique, dynamic electronic music that has no distinct boundaries. One moment would be a 200 mph drum-and-bass track, only to be overtaken moments later by the melodic sweeps of trance.
He would eventually send exhausted, sweat-soaked fans reeling into the cool Hollywood night, their bodies aching from the surprisingly physical experience of being subjected to levels of noise and bass previously unexpected.
It’s fitting that the music pouring out of the Palladium hit the senses so hard. For all intents and purposes, Bassnectar didn’t just perform. He was an unbridled knockout.

“The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,” Franklin D. Roosevelt said in his famous inaugural address.
Still, a mysterious and uncontrollably contagious illness spreading across the planet is probably an exception to Roosevelt’s advice.
Director Steven Soderbergh’s new film Contagion chronicles just that, and in the process examines just how the SARS-like disease featured in the film affects not only our immune systems but our psyches.
As an exercise in plot, Contagion is surprisingly demure. There’s none of the iconic storylines that one would expect to find in the infection-thriller genre: no apocalyptic destruction of cities, no epic escape for survival, no sinister military involvement and no miraculous cure to save the planet.
In fact, the story is so simple that it would be easy to mistake the film itself for simple. Where Soderbergh’s feature shines is in the details — in the quiet moments and the conundrums Contagion’s characters are forced to navigate.
The disaster starts with Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow), who becomes the first victim of a disease that soon begins appearing in populations all across the world.
Woven through this initial premise are stories of numerous characters who all play crucial roles in revealing the facets of the disaster. There’s Mitch Emhoff (Matt Damon), Beth Emhoff’s husband; Dr. Erin Mears (Kate Winslet), who is tasked with uncovering what the illness actually is; and Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) as the constantly paranoid conspiracy blogger, intent to reveal the government’s supposed corruption in dealing with the pandemic.
Lawrence Fishburne makes an appearance as the composed Dr. Ellis Cheever, a higher-up at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. And Marion Cotillard stars as a World Health Organization official, sent to China to find the source of the disease.
What helps Soderbergh’s vision come to life onscreen is the collective ability of this cast, which happens to be a revelation.
Soderberg’s similarly star-studded ensemble cast in the Ocean’s Eleven series took advantage of their statuses, playing up the group dynamics and having fun. In Contagion, however, the cast melts into the woodwork of the story with subtlety.  Soderbergh’s adroit directorial touch insists that you never end up conscious of who’s onscreen, even though every performance — and that’s no exaggeration — is convincing to the core. This is part of why the film works so well.
An even bigger aspect of the film’s success is how Soderbergh manages to pace and uncoil the mystery surrounding the disease. Contagion builds slowly — slowly enough that it might frustrate some viewers — and the divergent storylines of the various characters mean the film never really hits a smooth stride. Instead, the story tumbles forward, bouncing between characters and moments at will.
Thankfully, these moments happen to be well-crafted and cleverly run the gamut of experience one might expect in an epidemic scenario. The struggles of Mitch Emhoff as he attempts to balance his grief and his role as a father to his daughter play beautifully next to the loftier problems of the CDC’s Cheever. Even the annoying, smirking Krumweide’s storyline works brilliantly, toying with people’s paranoid fears of governmental secrets and inside dealing.
More than anything, Contagion succeeds because of its understated nature. Where 1995’s Outbreak terrorized with an exotic, critically fatal disease and the threat of military destruction, Contagion’s scares are far more cloaked and insidious.  The way Soderbergh re-frames the ordinary into the deadly — coughing on a bus, a stray handshake, and a well-used doorknob — is ingenious.
In that sense, Contagion is less about a disease and more about the toxic fear it can cause — and how that fear can spread like wildfire, causing us to behave and think in ways we would never otherwise behave.  While a fast-spreading disease of unknown providence is a horrifying notion, it might just be even more terrifying to take note of how panic can destroy us too.
Maybe Roosevelt was correct after all. Being fearful can be deadly.
And what a coincidence: Contagion will leave you scared like no other recent movie can.

Fox Sports show insensitive
I was recently made aware of an appalling video that was the centerpiece of a Sept. 2, 2011, show called The College Experiment that was produced by Fox Sports.
In the show, reporter Bob Oschack made fun of unsuspecting Asian international students at the University of Southern California by asking them questions about American football and about Colorado and Utah joining the Pac-12 Conference.
Mr. Orschack singled out students who were not familiar with football and belittled them, making fun of their accents. His idea of humor and satire was inappropriate, insensitive to our Asian-Pacific American and international communities and a form of racism.
The diversity of our community and our culture of mutual respect are core values that sustain USC.
Just the other day, as I was sitting in the International Plaza of our campus center, I saw students of all backgrounds, heard a multitude of languages and smiled to myself and thought how special it is to be a member of a dynamic, diverse community of scholars who share common values of hard work, intellectual engagement, openness to learning new things and the USC Trojan Family.
USC is very proud of the fact that shortly after it opened its doors in 1880 one of its very first entering classes included international students (from Japan) and it now enrolls more international students than any other university in the United States. Our students hail from 115 different countries.
We have one of the largest international alumni populations of any American university and many of our faculty and staff are also from other countries. USC has offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taipei, Seoul, Mexico City and Mumbai that support faculty research, recruitment of new students, alumni programs and development activities.
Fox Sports rightly cancelled the show, but not until after it aired. It should have never appeared on its airwaves.
Though the network did issue an apology to President Nikias and the USC community, we hope that there are actions underway at the network to assure that in the future no other individual or group of individuals will be similarly mistreated.
The Society for Professional Journalists has a code of ethics that journalists around the world voluntarily adhere to in their work.
The key tenets are: Seek the truth and report it, minimize harm, act independently and be accountable. I hope that Mr. Oschack and others responsible at Fox Sports take a refresher course on journalistic ethics and adhere to the standards of basic respect and decency.
Michael L. Jackson
Vice President of Student Affairs
Good point you make. I just hope those same journalistic ethics you claim are as important to the self proclaimed “mainstream media” such as CBS, ABC, NBC, MSNBC and CNN, NY & LA Times as you want them to be for FOX. As somebody that likes to think independently, I see a whole lot of unethical behavior toward those that disagree with these so called “reporting agencies”.  Their bias and untruthful reporting (i.e. Dan Rather) are well documented yet I don’t see any of these outlets outraged by that.

There’s a cookie cutter path we’re all supposed to take in life: Graduate from high school; go to college; finish in four years; and get a job, or continue with more school. More often than not, life doesn’t work that way. And it shouldn’t have to.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
Society seems to hold certain conventions when it comes to students’ educational and career paths and certain stigmas for the students brave enough to break them. Twenty-first-century education, however, is evolving with the rest of society, generating more and more alternatives that allow students unprecedented space to take any path we want.
The next step should be greater acceptance of taking the alternative route. Positive dialogue — and more dialogue in general — about these changes in education is key so students feel more comfortable and supported in making different decisions.
Universities offer plenty of services — academic and personal — that should continue to serve as informational resources and support for students.
Today, it’s commonplace that students go abroad or stay abroad for longer periods of time, which underscores the globalization of American universities.
New majors and minors are emerging at campuses across the country, expanding possible tracks to take within one area of study and alternative ways to study almost any subject.
The amount of students staying past the customary four years is increasing, and this is a good thing for the evolution of the educational process in this country.
University education is evolving to be more relevant, more boundless and more flexible.
A degree is important, but not time sensitive. The decision to take time off school to work, to take care of personal responsibilities or to pursue an alternative path should be applauded, not stigmatized. USC does a great job of offering that support; the university even has an Undergraduate Handbook for Leave of Absence that provides steps to follow from the moment students decide to leave to their eventual return.
Universities could also adapt to such changes by promoting flexibility in major and graduation requirements.
There’s a critical value to the structure and rigor requirements provide, but universities could do more to match the changing realities of students’ educational and life cycles.
The more bureaucratic hoops students have to jump through to do something creative with their majors, or to pursue something outside of school for a semester, the less students will want to even try.
Interrupted or extended education is another result of the dismal financial climate. Current college students and recent graduates were dubbed “Generation Limbo,” by a recent New York Times article for our stalled careers and life paths.
The article quotes and describes graduates’ frustration with “[doing] everything [they] were supposed to do,” — working incredibly hard for years in school, mapping out a career, and seeing little to no returns.
There’s something to be said for breaking away from the well-beaten path and exploring different options. We can’t control the economy. And we certainly shouldn’t resign ourselves to “limbo.”
Doing “what you’re supposed to” does not guarantee results in today’s economic environment, so why not reinvent our conventional ideas of educational paths and success?
Traditionally, education has been viewed as a static process. In recent years, however, a greater number of students are choosing to take alternative paths to achieve similar goals. It’s an intriguing time of transition. It’s time for everyone involved — students, faculty, administrators — to embrace and monitor that transition, and take the next steps forward.

California Legislature is on the verge of passing a new law that would allow illegal immigrants to receive state-financial aid for college.
A part of the two-bill package, known as California DREAM Act, has been approved by the Senate. The act would make California the first state to offer public funding to undocumented students.
The approved section of the DREAM Act would allow qualified illegal immigrants to apply for Cal Grants, community college waivers and other public aid programs. To become eligible for the aid, the students would need to be California high school graduates who were educated in the state for a minimum of three years, and demonstrate both financial need and academic merit.
Although the new law would not provide a citizenship path for the students, it would give them more benefits than in any other state in the country.
Republican Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, who represents San Bernardino, is a vocal critic of the Act and said he would try to organize a ballot referendum to overturn the legislation. “The governor is coming to the folks and saying they need to pay more, and then he’s going to turn around and say we still have money to hand over to people who are in the country illegally. That is absolutely wrong,” said Donnelly.
Go Donnelly!

Israeli-Egyptian relations continued to deteriorate after an attack on the Israeli Embassy in Egypt left three dead and more than 1,000 injured. Protestors stormed the embassy and trashed offices, forcing almost the entire Israeli staff to flee Egypt.
Early Saturday, the streets of Cairo erupted in violence between protestors and security forces. The clash led Egypt’s military leaders to reactivate an emergency law that makes it easier for authorities to arrest people and puts restrictions on demonstrations.
The attack appeared to confirm fears that the 1979 peace treaty between the two countries is now in jeopardy since Egyptian dictator and relative ally to Israel Hosni Mubarak was ousted from power earlier this year after decades of rule. The treaty between the two countries is widely unpopular with the Egyptian people.
Egypt’s new leadership appears torn between honoring the Israeli alliance, which brings support and aid from the United States, and enacting a more antagonistic stance towards Israel, a move that would appease the Egyptian people. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu avoided criticizing Egypt and stressed the importance of the strategic relationship between the two nations.

Known to Austin Powers fans as Doctor Evil’s hired Korean assassin, Random Task, Joseph Hyungmin Son has been sentenced to life in prison for the gang rape and torture of a young Orange County woman, committed on Christmas Eve of 1990.
According to the Los Angeles Times, the young woman, who is being referred to as Jane Doe, was walking back to her residence around 12:30 a.m. when she was approached by Son. He asked for directions before forcing her into a vehicle with the aid of accomplice, Santiago Lopez Gaitan.
The two men threatened to kill the woman, tortured her with a loaded gun and repeatedly raped, sodomized and forced her into oral copulation before allowing her to leave, naked and reportedly with her pants tied around her eyes.
Officials obtained a DNA sample from the victim but were unable to identify Son as the perpetrator. Then, in May 2008, he was convicted of an unrelated case of vandalism in which a DNA sample was collected. The DNA matched that found in the 1990 case.
Due to statute of limitations, Son has not been convicted of sexual assault charges but has successfully been convicted of felony torture. Gaitan has pleaded guilty to charges including kidnapping and rape, and has been sentenced to 17 years and four months in state prison.
The victim stated in court, “I feel debilitating fear come over me and am convinced a hand is coming from behind again. My emotional scars are intense. My 20s were stripped from my life as I relearned how to walk, see, hear and cope with the outside world again. Joseph Son not only cost me my job at my salon but also my college savings … not to mention the impact it’s made on celebrating Christmas year after year.”

The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum reigns as an illustrious landmark in the minds of USC students, playing host to our beloved home football games.
But in June 2010, the Coliseum witnessed tragedy when a teenage girl, Sarah Rodriguez, died of an ecstasy overdose when she attended the Electric Daisy Carnival. The girl’s parents are now suing the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission and the event company Insomniac, which put on the rave, for negligence in their supervision of EDC.
The lawsuit claims the event was overcrowded and understaffed, which delayed the response by medical staff provided to the victim. By the time she arrived at the hospital, the suit claims, she was nonverbal and salivating, and suffered a seizure shortly thereafter.
The Coliseum had no comment regarding the suit, but Insomniac has deemed the case “completely without merit.”
Drug use, especially that of ecstasy, known as a “party drug,” has grown increasingly prominent among teenagers and young adults, particularly in the LA area, which hosts a wide variety of raves. The Coliseum and the Shrine Auditorium, both of which lie just outside the USC campus, host several raves each year, all of which attract a wide variety of “ravers” of all ages, many of whom take ecstasy when they attend a rave.
Correction: An earlier version of this article stated Rodriguez died ‘this past June.’ Rodriguez passed away in June of 2010.
First, the EDC where Sasha died was June 2010, not “this past June.”  This past June, EDC took place in Las Vegas (among other locations).
Second, this lawsuit is ridiculous.  Sasha was a girl who ingested drugs that she clearly did not understand and paid the price for it.  Not all drugs are dangerous, especially ecstasy, if they are taken by someone who understands how the drug works and how to mitigate the negative side effects.  I was at EDC 2010 in the Coliseum and know that Insomniac did what they could to reduce drug use, but just as at ANY music festival (such as Coachella, Bonaroo, or Sasquatch) there will be drug use.  What Insomniac should be sued for is the awful performance that Deadmau5 put on that summer…

An emerging Los Angeles band, Nacosta, is throwing its listeners into a time warp.
Two brothers, Shane and Brandon Graham, are showcasing their love for both the ’60s and the ’90s by combining musical structures from each era. Inspired by icons such as The Beatles, Radiohead and Neil Young, the band merges the styles of each. Maybe it’s the current trend of loving anything remotely vintage, or maybe it’s because Shane likes to experiment with modern jazz and electronic music drum beats.
To add a more eclectic vibe to their music, Nacosta is currently searching for a dedicated keyboardist and a multi-instrumentalist based out of Los Angeles. The Graham brothers are hoping to find someone who can play the mandolin, harmonica, keyboard and guitar. Anyone who thinks they have what it takes to audition can contact them via Facebook.
Nacosta plays regularly at Pehrspace, The Good Hurt, The Stovepipe Lounge and other venues in the Los Angeles area.
The band is excitedly gearing up for its debut EP Wilderness City, to be released Sept. 14, on its very own label, Ancient Conductor Records.

As if addiction to the popular game Angry Birds is not enough, players can now take their obsession to life-size proportions with the new Angry Birds “theme park” that opened this month.
Located in Changsha, China, this attraction allows guests to catapult plush birds at green pig balloons situated throughout a brick fortress.
The activity is a part of China’s Window of the World amusement park, Changsha’s 400,00 square meter recreational attraction. Located in the American Zone next to a downsized Mount Rushmore replica, this giant slingshot was created for the Stress-reducing festival of the park.
However, the theme park is not officially licensed by Rovio, the Finnish company responsible for America’s addiction to the most popular smart phone application in history. Coincidentally, Angry Birds moon cakes were just introduced by Rovio to celebrate the Mid-Autumn festival in China. There will also be a limited edition of the Angry Birds app called “Moon Festival” be released next month.
Rovio declined to comment to ABC news, but a lawsuit is not expected because the attraction is to close at the end of September.
