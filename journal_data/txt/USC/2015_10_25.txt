Crash course · Environmental student groups hosted a training session on Sunday for students to learn about the different aspects of advocacy such as social media strategy, recruitment and effective messaging. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Students and grassroots organizers from various groups participated in an activist training hosted by the Environmental Core in collaboration with the CALPIRG USC chapter Sunday at the Von KleinSmid Center.
The training aimed to educate students about how to develop effective strategies to build student-led chapters, run campaigns for a sustainable future and achieve tangible results for environmental justice. Grassroots advocacy works to increase awareness of the importance of active participation in conversations on issues that matter.
“Democracy is about involving everyone to make the change,” said Sarah Dobjensky, organizing director for WISPIRG Students. “People get involved for different reasons such as altruism, self-interest, social needs — which are all legitimate.”
The guest speakers included Emma Crossen, development director of Courage Campaign, an online grassroot organizing community; Jenn Engstrom, organizing director for the CALPIRG student-chapters; Garrick Monaghan, campaign organizer at We are Impact and Dobjensky.
The training also covered four modules: effective recruitment, social media strategy, campaign planning and framing appeals and messages to decision-makers.
Crossen noted the success of online petitions such as one concerning Nestle pumping water in California, which received media coverage from the Los Angeles Times and The Guardian.
Ethan Bialick, a member of the Environmental Core and a senior majoring in business administration, believes that this training can be helpful to any group no matter what stage it’s at in its campaign. Bialick is part of the Go Solar Campaign, which  presented the University administration with a business proposal to go solar by 2020.
“They can get out of [the training] basically those four modules and how to do each of those well and push [them] through,” he said. “We think that this can be really be both for activism and [professionally because] organizing is very much parallel to running a company well.”
Sarah Berry, an undeclared freshman and campaign coordinator for the USC Go Solar campaign, encouraged other students to take action.
“If you have an idea that you feel strongly about and that you think other people should also feel strongly about but you don’t know how to go about getting people interested or presenting it to the world, don’t be afraid of doing it,” she said. “You have a voice and you might not know quite how to harness it or use it effectively, but you can find out and you can learn how to do it. When you do [learn], you can make a huge impact. You might be only one person, but when we work together we can work real change.”
Berry also emphasized the urgency and the need for student activists.
“We do have the power to fix it, maybe not to completely bring it back to what it was but to help [as much as we can],” she said. “I want to be part of making the world a better place before we destroy what’s left.”

Nick Pappas, a former USC football player, coach and associate athletic director, passed away of natural causes on Friday at his home in Pasadena. He was 99.
Students, staff, administrators and football fans mourned his passing with a moment of silence at Saturday’s USC-Utah football game, and acknowledged the nearly six decades of service to the University that led Pappas to be nicknamed “Mr. Trojan.”
According to the Los Angeles Times, Pappas, who was born in Seattle in 1916, started as a tailback for the USC football team in 1935 and led the team in rushing for the next three years under coach Howard Jones. He played for the Hollywood Bears, his first pro football experience, from 1938 to 1939 before returning to USC to coach the freshman teams.
When the United States entered World War II, Pappas joined the Navy, earning Purple Heart and Silver Star medals for his service overseas. After the end of the war, Pappas found himself at USC once again, scouting for the football team for two years before starting as an assistant coach under Jess Hill in 1953.
As assistant coach, Pappas helped lead the Trojans to the Rose Bowl in 1954. Perhaps his most lasting contribution to the University, however, was the establishment of the Trojan Club athletic booster organization, a group he created in the late 1950s with the goal of establishing a bond between the school and its athletic donors, according to the CBS News.
Though Pappas retired in 1981, he worked to raise endowment funds for the University through wills and estates until 2004. He was inducted into the USC Athletic Hall of Fame in 1997 and received USC’s Alumni Service Award.
Pappas is survived by his daughters, Lisa Widman and Mona Pappas, as well as five grandchildren and multiple great-grandchildren. His wife of 66 years, Deedy, and his daughter Rene Arrobio passed away before him. Services for Pappas are pending; his family encourages well-wishers to donate to the USC Nick Pappas Football Scholarship.

The Undergraduate Student Government has started a new mental health initiative with the objective of exposing freshmen at orientation to mental health concerns via awareness talks and events.
Christine Hasrouni, director of USG Wellness Affairs, is leading the project. Hasrouni recently attended a meeting with Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry, Assistant Vice Provost for Student Affairs Lynette Merriman and members of the board of trustees where the plan was discussed.
“One of the things Dr. Carry said was, ‘We need to focus on freshmen,’” Hasrouni said. “What better way to start talking about mental health than at freshman orientation and Welcome Week? That’s basically the only time when they’re all together, and we can get them all in a room and talk about it.”
Hasrouni said one of the features of the mental health orientation sessions would be a student panel composed of upperclassmen, who would talk about the issues they encountered during their USC years.
“When you’re coming in as a freshman in college, you are really looking for peers and their companionship, and when you have an administrator it almost feels like someone is giving you a lecture,” Hasrouni said. “But if you hear it from someone who has just gone through it, it feels more real … you listen more to people your own age sometimes.”
Hasrouni said the panel would deal with problems such as not finding your niche, discovering that you are not in the top 3 percent of your class anymore due to increased competition and realizing that your educational desires might be different from those of your parents.
Another change will be the modification of the SCits, which are student-performed skits at orientation that deal with topics such as sexual assault, peer pressure and drug and alcohol abuse. Hasrouni is planning on adding more skits related to mental health.
“I believe that they had [skits] in the past that dealt with mental health, but they didn’t think that it truly represented what they wanted it to,” Hasrouni said. ”So, they’re going to be sending out this script and see if maybe we can edit it and tweak it so that it really fits what we’re looking for,” Hasrouni said.
In addition, Hasrouni wants to change Welcome Week’s sexual assault training sessions. She is hoping to have a counselor come in during the last 10 minutes of the training to talk about the counseling center and how to book an appointment.
“We were thinking about presenting this information to freshmen during orientation but freshmen are thrown with so much administrative information that I don’t think they would remember, ‘Oh yeah, we call, and then there’s a 30-minute phone screening,’” Hasrouni said.
Hasrouni also explained how mental health awareness should be emphasized in International Student Orientation, in an effort to remove the cultural stigma surrounding counseling.
“Counseling can sometimes be considered a Western idea, and a lot of international students from various cultures have a stigma against going to the counseling center, [thinking] that it’s almost shameful to go,” Hasrouni said. “So we introduce it to them at international orientation to hopefully get more traction, so they won’t be as afraid to maybe make that phone call. Maybe we can explain that it’s totally private that if they go to the counseling center no one will know, except the counselor.”
Hasrouni stressed the importance of these changes.
“I’m really excited for this panel to talk about what’s real, because sometimes going through Welcome Week, orientation, it’s all, ‘This is why USC is great’ and sometimes it is not great,” Hasrouni said. “Sometimes I think it’s important to look at the times [college] gets hard.”
Camille Tenerife, a first-year master’s student studying marriage and family therapy, said she welcomed the new initiative.
“I agree with it. I think there’s definitely a stigma around mental health, and a lot of students don’t know about it or don’t want to seek assistance, but if it’s placed in and normalized, then I think they’re more likely to seek out the help and utilize the resources,” she said. “Everyone can use some sort of assistance, especially when transitioning to college.”
Mona Xia, a junior majoring in critical studies, said that though she liked the idea of emphasizing mental health at orientation, she fears the message will fall on deaf ears.
“I think it can go one of two ways — it can either go well and actually be useful, or it can be kind of like those sexual assault mandatory screenings where people don’t really take it very seriously. It’s a shame because I think it’s a very important message,” she said. “I think it depends on the execution of everything, but I think it’s a good idea.”
—- I think there’s definitely a stigma around mental health
That is only an indication of a prejudice you have internalized and can overcome.

Helping hand · Undergraduate Student Government Sen. Sabrina Enriquez is putting together a resource guide for undocumented students. – Beverly Pham | Daily Trojan
Undergraduate Student Government Residential Senator Sabrina Enriquez is working on a resource guide for prospective and continuing students who are undocumented immigrants, which she hopes to release on USG’s website before Thanksgiving break.
In June, Enriquez attended the National Conference on Race and Ethnicity in Washington, D.C.
At the conference, she took part in a workshop on the necessity of providing resources and centers for undocumented students.
After the conference, Enriquez researched what resources USC has to offer undocumented students and found that there is no University-wide policy regarding undocumented students or a center for the students on campus.
Enriquez set out to make a guide so that undocumented students have some direction when completing the Common Application, finding scholarships they are eligible for and receiving support on campus from the Latina/o, Black and Asian Pacific American student assemblies.
“[Undocumented students] are the most marginalized — they’re marginalized in the public sphere and being students who are paying to come to this University, they’re offered no help or guidance,” Enriquez said. “My long-term goal is to have a resource center [for undocumented students] like they have at UC Davis, UC Berkeley and all the other UCs.”
USG President Rini Sampath said the move is part of a larger effort by USG to support underrepresented students.
“One of our priorities this year has been to bring these marginalized students to the forefront, and I think that’s what this initiative reflects,” she said. “I know we have a greater purpose in student government through our cultural assemblies and our committees to serve students who come from various communities and … creating a resource guide is one of the ways to tackle the lack of administrative attention to undocumented students.”
Enriquez’s guide addresses if undocumented students can attend USC and helps prospective students in filling out the Common Application, advising them to leave their resident status and Social Security numbers blank.
The guide also provides students with a list of scholarships that do not require the applicant to be a U.S. citizen or legal resident to ensure that undocumented students have the opportunity to attend college despite the fact that many of them are not eligible for financial aid or federal work study.
Enriquez said few undocumented students apply to USC because they are misinformed about University policies.
“We’re missing out on so many top-tier students because they don’t know that they can come here or the resources aren’t available for them to come here,” Enriquez said. “How can we claim that we are recruiting the best and the brightest when an entire population is being left out?”
Because immigration laws are constantly in flux, Enriquez wants the University to hire counselors who are knowledgeable about policies regarding undocumented students so they can guide these students in accordance to laws regarding their status and on finding the right federal resources. She also wants counselors to provide these students with information on finding affordable housing near campus and resources to ensure that undocumented students do not have to take extensive leaves of absence to work in order to pay for college.
Enriquez said building a strong community on campus is another one of her priorities.
“I think that by building these communities and networks, it will not only take away the stigma, but also encourage those [undocumented students] who are here to reach out and join these communities and feel more empowered because this is their university as much as [it is] anyone else’s,” Enriquez said.
Sampath said the University lacks accessible data on undocumented students and their experience at USC.
“We really don’t know what our undocumented student demographic looks like because at the moment there aren’t any statistics or public information about them in regards to USC,” Sampath said. “I think what step one should be is figuring out how can we serve these students by bringing their voices to light and then addressing those concerns based on their needs.”
Being an international or undocumented student isn’t easy, given our complex culture and language.
Assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking
on life’s journey. A new award-winning worldwide book/ebook that can aid anyone
coming to the US is “What Foreigners
Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American
Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in
foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors,
educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful
in the US and how they contributed to our society, including students.  
   A chapter on education explains how to be
accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture,
friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after
graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to
get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to
work with/for an American firm here or overseas. 
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and
speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the
number one stumbling block they say they have to
succeeding here. 
   Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments,
immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow
students, and informative books like this to extend a cultural helping hand so
we all have a win-win situation.  Good luck to all wherever you study!

The women’s soccer team continued its outstanding run of form this weekend, edging Utah 1-0 on Friday before downing Colorado 3-0 on Sunday.
The Women of Troy improved to 12-4-1 on the season. Only one of those four losses came in conference play.
Friday’s game against Utah was of the grind-it-out genre. It was not the team’s most dominant performance, but USC still managed to get the result. gainst a stingy Utes side.
The lone goal came from the penalty spot, courtesy of junior midfielder Mandy Freeman.
There was never a doubt on Sunday though, as the Women of Troy nabbed two first-half goals and never looked back against Colorado.
Junior forward Savannah Levin got on the end of a Freeman cross to open the scoring in the ninth minute. The goal was Levin’s first of the campaign.
Morgan Andrews then doubled the lead at 23 minutes, as she fired a penalty kick past Buffs goalkeeper Scout Watson. The goal gave the Women of Troy breathing room and allowed them to play a freeflowing style as the match progressed.
Andrews struck again at 51 minutes off of a Kayla Mills corner kick. The powerful midfielder soared for a header inside the box, made solid connection and found the top corner of the goal. Andrews, who now has five goals on the season, was dominant against a talented Buffs team on Sunday.
“It just came down to going in as hard as we can and matching their aggressiveness,” she said.
Meanwhile, head coach Keidane McAlpine felt that his team rebounded from a sluggish performance on Friday and was thus able to come out firing on Sunday.
“I thought we learned a lot from Friday,” McAlpine said.
Elite teams can prove that an average performance is a mere aberration, which was certainly the case for USC this weekend. The Utah game was a decent showing, whereas the bounce-back performance against Colorado was as convincing as it gets.
The Women of Troy have a stacked roster, an outstanding coach and fantastic team chemistry.
“You just really want to just show what you have and that you’re having fun out there,” Andrews said. “I worked as hard I could for my teammates, and they did the same thing for me.”
The Women of Troy work for each other, hold themselves accountable and have fun.
While it is important to have a good time out there, playing a proper game and dominating possession makes the experience enjoyable.
Not only did the Women of Troy see more of the ball than the Buffs, but they also logged 29 shots on the afternoon. That means they took a shot about every three minutes, which shows just how explosive this team is on offense.
That said,  offensive fireworks must be complemented by defensive fortitude.
“Because our offense was so good, the defensive side was good as well,” McAlpine said.
Consistent play on offense took a tremendous amount of pressure off of the defense against the Buffaloes.
Despite the fact that USC dominated, the defense stood tall when it was asked to do so.
“I thought our organization on the defensive end was pretty good most of the day, so it was a really, really solid day,” McAlpine said.
McAlpine was encouraged by his team’s improvement on Sunday.
“We were a little bit more on the front foot, making better decisions, and thus turned into early goals and early chances, which was great for us,” he said.
The Women of Troy are not only making chances — they are taking them. They are riding a five-game win streak and have outscored their opponents 13-2 during that stretch.
The Colorado game was the last home contest of the year for the Women of Troy, who were celebrating their seniors on Sunday. In front of a capacity crowd of 568 at McAlister Field, the team honored its eight seniors before putting on a show for the faithful.
McAlpine was appreciative of the crowd’s support and added that his team was able to feed off the enthusiasm coming from the bleachers.
“It was the perfect way for these seniors to play their last home game,” he said.
The Women of Troy, ranked No. 24 in the country, will head north to take on Stanford and Cal this week.
“Now we’ve got Stanford sitting in front of us. We’ve got to bring the proper energy to the game,” McAlpine said.

Let’s hear it for Helton · Interim head coach Clay Helton led the unranked Trojans to a 42-24 win over No. 3 Utah Saturday in the Coliseum. He is now 2-1 as the head coach of the Trojans, losing only to Notre Dame. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
Two years ago, USC had an interim head coach and was coming off a close loss to Notre Dame as they prepared to face off against the Utah Utes for parents weekend. The Trojans entered that game shorthanded, as multiple linemen and skill position players were injured. In fact, the Trojans were so thin that most pundits criticized the NCAA for putting student-athletes’ safety at risk.
Two years later, and the Trojans walked into their 2015 battle against the Utes under eerily similar circumstances. They are decimated by injuries and under the direction of yet another interim head coach. Just like in 2013 when the team pulled out an incredibly gutsy 19-3 victory over Utah, the Trojans rallied again on Saturday to win in convincing fashion against the No. 3 team in the country.
The game, and the Trojans’ performance, told us a lot about this year’s squad. For the first or second time this season, the Trojans played with fight and resolve for 60 minutes. It also showed us how great the Trojan program really can be.
Last week, I wrote that the Trojan program is a fallen power, which it is. I also said that the right coach can take the Trojans back to national prominence within one season, and Saturday was a testament to that.
The USC team was playing with a second string offensive line. They were missing their starting running back, multiple receivers, and members of the secondary and they still dominated Utah, which came into the game as the No. 3 team in the country.
In the last two years since the 2013 Utah game, USC has floundered tremendously. They have had multiple coaches, multiple scandals and a wide array of losses in games they should have won. Conversely, Utah has been a steady ship. The Utes have ascended to national relevancy through disciplined football and consistent coaching. They probably weren’t deserving of the No. 3 ranking in the country, but they are most certainly a top 10 to 15 program.
Yet, when the Trojans faced off on Saturday they were favored, and they proved Vegas right because they were the better team. I would also say that USC’s talent is so superior to Utah’s that they would beat them seven or eight times out of 10.
That is absolutely ludicrous to think about as a college football fan. USC, which has suffered so much turmoil and endured so many distractions, still is good enough to beat a very solid football program more than 50 percent of the time. Utah has climbed so high in two years, and yet they still cannot eclipse the Trojan brand at its worst. It’s not just Utah, I’m sure the same could be said about most programs in the country. USC isn’t a national power anymore, but they very well could and should be with the right coach.
USC recruits great talent, and as Saturday proved, the better players will win out most of the time. The Trojans have notoriously under-developed many of their highly touted recruits over the last few years. Yet, the playmakers, who have been able to transcend lackluster coaching, demonstrated on Saturday how lethal talent can be on the football field. Whether that was JuJu Smith-Schuster outrunning the Utah secondary on crossing route after crossing route, or Ronald Jones breaking through the line and arm tackles, the Trojans have the talent on this team and in the pipeline to be a national brand in 2016.
That coach is still up in the air, but I hope very fair consideration is given to Clay Helton. While he is still adjusting to the head coaching role, he clearly has this team playing with passion and pride. The Trojans haven’t jumped around at midfield to start the fourth quarter like they did Saturday in a very long time.
Whoever the coach is, he has to understand the value and history of the Trojan football team. The Trojan program has a long lineage of great players, who can mentor and shape the current student-athletes. The talent is there, the resources are there. Everything is there for a coach to come in and have USC back atop the rankings next year.
USC should be in every game the rest of the season, and there is no reason they can’t win the Pac-12 South if Utah loses once more. It may not happen, but they certainly have the talent and capability to make it happen. That’s a pretty impressive feat considering everything that has happened the past few months, and even more so, the past few years. Hopefully, next year the goal will move from a conference championship to a national one.

Jake Davidon did not realize that USC is a super-power in football.  The university had poor quality coaches in Lane Kiffin and Steve Sarkasian.  The USC team was losing almost all of the matches from the later half of the third quarter or from the beginning of the fourth quarter.  The statistics clearly indicated that USC lacked the running game and strong defense in the last stages of the game, an outcome that could be attributed to poor endurance training and poor psycholgical strength to finish the game properly.  The team always had excellent players although the team probably played well below its potential.  That may be the consequence when the establishment inflates average coaches and overpays them with huge multi-million dollar contracts.

The No. 2-ranked men’s water polo team lost its first Mountain Pacific Sports Federation match 8-7 in a back-and–forth battle with No. 4 Pacific in Stockton Sunday afternoon.
Despite a hat trick from sophomore James Walters, the Trojans could not score in the final minutes when the team was trailing by a single goal.
The Trojans fall to 17-3 overall and 5-1 in the conference after suffering their first loss on their MPSF schedule. The Tigers have improved their record to 19-2 and 5-0 in conference play.
After the first quarter, Pacific led 2-1, but the Trojans answered back securing a 4-3 halftime lead. In the second half, the scoring was sparse, and heading into the final period of play, the game was tied.
With three minutes to go in the game, the score was 7-6 Pacific, and though both teams scored, the Trojans had possession as time was expiring, but was unable to convert a goal, instead turning the ball over.
Sophomore All-American goalkeeper McQuin Baron recorded nine saves on the day, but it was offset by the eight goals that Pacific scored. In contrast, Pacific goalie Brady Moore gave up seven goals, but recorded 14 saves. The Trojans ranked second in the conference in goals allowed, giving up just five goals per game.
Sophomore Grant Stein scored two goals for USC, and junior Blake Edwards and sophomore Lachlan Edwards each netted a goal in a game in which the Trojans struggled to get their offense going to its usual level. Prior to this game, USC was leading the MPSF with just over 16 goals per game.
USC also recorded 13 turnovers, which was six more than Pacific, and was part of USC’s downfall.
The Trojans will now have a long week of work ahead of them before they travel to Berkeley to take on No. 3 California, which is coming off a one-goal loss to    top-ranked UCLA.

Thanksgiving is that special time of the year to be with loved ones and to indulge in a delicious Thanksgiving feast. Many USC students choose to head back home during the four-day break to celebrate the holidays with their family and friends. If you’re like me, however, you may not be able to go home for Thanksgiving because your family is too far away. With Thanksgiving fast approaching, it’s time to consider making some plans for the holiday break. Why spend your Thanksgiving holidays in your dorm room when you could be out exploring the beauty of the U.S.? 
Check out these steps to planning the most memorable Thanksgiving road trip ever:
Make a List of Destinations
Ask your friends and roommates to make a list of all the places they would like to go to during their lifetime. Then choose the top three within a reasonable distance and vote to decide on which you’d like to see during your road trip. I found some great ideas for where to go by checking out popular travel bloggers’ Instagram accounts, browsing friends’ Facebook pictures and asking friends and family for travel ideas. If you’re still out of ideas, check out U.S. News & World Report’s “Best Places to Visit in the USA.”
Create an Itinerary
Once you have figured out which places to go — whether it is landmarks, national parks or scenery — and activities you are going to do on the road trip, you can create an itinerary. Calculate a budget by estimating costs associated with your trip. Quick tip: Check out Travelmath.com, which is a free online trip calculator that can help determine transportation costs by factoring in travel distance and travel time.
Suggested Itineraries and Things to Do:
 Roadtrip to Utah
At the Park City Mountain Resort in Salt Lake City, Utah, you can ski and snowboard in one of the country’s ultimate winter resort destinations. Zipline across the canyon between Lookout Peak and Red Pine Lodge, which spans over 2,111 feet, or snowmobile across trails and forested mountain terrain.
Roadtrip to Arizona
In Arizona you can hike in the beauty of Grand Canyon National Park. You might want to go river rafting in the Colorado River while viewing amazing wildlife and scenery, or tour Antelope Valley for spectacular views of one of the most famous canyons on earth.
Roadtrip to San Francisco
Take a scenic drive along the iconic Pacific Coast Highway, and make stops along the way whenever you want to snap a picture of the beautiful coastline. To break up the drive, about two hours before you hit San Francisco you can take a detour to the charming shopping district in Carmel-by-the-Sea, or visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium and explore some cool sea life exhibits
Go. Have Fun!
Most importantly, don’t forget to de-stress from the pressures of school deadlines, assignments, exams and projects, and just have fun. This is the time to take a few days to keep your mind of off school, build closer bonds with your roommates or friends, and focus on enjoying the precious yet fleeting moments of college life.
After all, once college ends and you are busy working it will probably be more difficult to find time for an adventurous road trip with friends. In a few short weeks it will be time to sit back, relax and enjoy your vacation — so start planning your trip soon.

Whip it · Members of the Fight Crew attempt to jam the opposing team, the Varsity Brawlers, in order to prevent the pack from moving forward. Spectators saw shoving and body slamming, as these moves are allowed by the rules. – Photo courtesy of Varsity Brawlers
This weekend might have been a joyous time for Trojan football fans celebrating the victory over Utah, but those in El Sereno, an unassuming neighborhood in northeast Los Angeles, was concentrated on an athletic event of a completely different flavor. On Saturday evening, Angelenos congregated in a converted warehouse dubbed the “Dolloseum” to witness a roller derby bout between two local all-female teams, the Varsity Brawlers and Fight Crew, hosted by the LA Derby Dolls league.
With campy nicknames such as Broadzilla, Shady Hawkins and Fleetwood Smack, Brawlers and Fight Crew players sped on old-school quad skates around the concave-banked track in their respective purple and red uniforms. Some even sported full Dia de los Muertos face paint in honor of the upcoming holiday, adding to the endearing do-it-yourself spirit of the derby community. As the commentators narrated the match from their “box in the sky,” costumed children remained fixated on the action, cotton candy in hand, alongside their equally costumed parents; the diversity of the crowd was a testament to the LA Derby Dolls’ wide appeal.
Roller derby lives up to its title as a contact sport in every sense of the term. The game is divided into two-minute “jams,” where up to four blockers per team form a moving, writhing wall in an effort to prevent the other team’s lead star-emblazoned “jammer” from racing past. Naturally, this involves a high degree of shoving and body slamming, though it’s nothing that isn’t allowed in the handbook. Multiple referees circle within the track to enforce the rules. They also collaboratively monitor the score amid the frantic flailing of limbs and crashing of helmets. An on-location medical crew, affectionately named the “Doll Repair” team, tends to bruised players and portends the morbid reality of serious injuries that sometimes occur.
For those who are new to the sport, the association employs on-foot referees toting signs that read, “Questions? Talk derby to me.” They proved useful as the crowd was a varied mix of seasoned fans and curious newcomers. One such referee under the moniker “Marsha Law” offered some insight into the technical workings of roller derby.
“The title of ‘lead jammer’ is given to the first jammer to break through the pack when the jam starts. Then, points can be awarded, one point per opponent passed by the jammer,” Law said. “There are also certain rare moves allowed in the rules that players can execute, like the ‘whip.’”
To every Whip It fan’s delight, the move was carried out once during the bout: In the third quarter, the Brawlers’ Oblivienne Westwood racked up several points by tugging at the hem of her teammate, who propelled (or “whipped”) her forward past the rest of the pack. The technique ultimately gave the Brawlers the upper hand in the match, which ended in 150-117 in their favor.
Even spectators who weren’t quite so well-versed in the intricacies of the sport were enraptured and fully involved. First-timer Helen Ma, a USC student majoring in international relations (global business), gave positive feedback on the bout.
“There is a sense of freedom that the players transfer to the audience. I felt the adrenaline and camaraderie of the community just on my first visit,” Ma said. “Roller derby feels completely different than other female sports like volleyball, gymnastics or even powderpuff football. It is in-your-face and unapologetic about not catering to the male gaze.”
Ma wasn’t wrong about the female camaraderie. LA Derby Dolls also runs a junior league for aspiring players under 18, where they train and condition girls to embody their motto of “be your own hero.” Certain voyeurs hoping to drop by the Dolloseum for some visual titillation of a sexist nature will be met with hostility by no-nonsense female bouncers and a stern referee who rolls through the arena to enforce a no whistling policy.
Despite the remote location, the Dolloseum is worth visiting for sports enthusiasts and thrill-seekers alike, and offers other diversions including local vendors and group karaoke on the string light-illuminated patio. The undeniable energy delivered by the women of the LA Derby Dolls League is enough to double that of any football team. Those interested would benefit from watching the LA Derby Dolls in their no-holds-barred glory.

Since Electric Daisy Carnival 2016 tickets have been on sale for the past couple of weeks, it’s important to spotlight one of the driving forces in the electronic dance music industry right now — Insomniac. Everyone knows about EDC, whether it’s the Las Vegas and New York City events or the Nocturnal events that happen throughout California. However, each year Insomniac hosts some of the largest EDM events in the world and has even expanded its horizons to the United Kingdom, Puerto Rico and Brazil.
Insomniac, undoubtedly, is one of the top EDM event promoters in the industry. There are several reasons for this, one being its ambitious and fearless founder, Pasquale Rotella. Rotella started the company in 1993, and his youth and vibrance proved to be a driving factor for the success of the company. He drove his way right into the EDM world by striving to create a different sort of experience for the fans.
One of the most definitive aspects of Insomniac’s events versus others’, such as Live Nation’s, is the focus on a holistic, creative experience. Going to an Insomniac tour promises remarkable sets, installation art pieces and unbelievable pyrotechnics. In the music industry, creating an immersive experience for fans, especially at such large venues, is the only way to generate revenue and keep said fans coming to events.
Interactive art such as large daisies, mushrooms, electric neon lights and hundreds of characters in beautifully detailed costumes illuminate events in a way that brings fans into the music in every way. EDM is different from so many other genres due to the fact that not only is it a sonic experience, but also a visual one. Lasers, lights and pyrotechnics help to enhance this otherworldly experience that defines and separates these kinds of events.
Obviously, other festivals such as Hard Summer, Coachella and Burning Man feature electric artists in conjunction with large sets and carnival rides. However, Rotella continually goes above and beyond in order to provide the ultimate experience for EDM lovers. For each festival, he, along with his team, spends days and nights reorganizing stages, testing light and sound systems and changing every last detail until he can visualize the entire experience that the headliners will participate in.
Rotella’s proactive role in the formation of the events is part of the reason fans are so stunned each year when they walk onto the venues. Nowadays EDC is held at venues such as the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, Metlife Stadium and huge convention centers. However, one of EDC’s first events happened close to home — right here at the Shrine Auditorium in 1997.
With only a few headliners, the first EDC was just a small passion project for Rotella. Now, Insomniac has millions of attendees from all over the world for their events. Insomniac also has one of the largest selections of EDM artists in the world. Featuring plenty of Billboard top DJs, Insomniac has also helped smaller DJ’s break into the scene with stages such as the 7Up stage and FunkHouse.
This is why Insomniac is such an important event to me — Rotella has brought one of the most controversial music genres to the forefront of the music industry. For many years, EDM and raves were thought to take place in dirty underground dance clubs. Raves could really be found only in abandoned warehouses and were associated with drugs, sex and hedonism. For a young man to create a world of art, sonic experience and musical transcendence that broke the barriers of taboo was an innovation in itself.
Insomniac continues to bring this concept of an otherworldly experience for the fans by creating a new world in music each year. Continually expanding their market, Insomniac now holds events all across the world as far as Japan and Brazil. Each year they offer new artists, art pieces and a whole new take on the life of PLUR.
As a third-year EDC attendee, I have to recommend going to an Insomniac event once in your lifetime. This company has completely revamped the EDM sector of the music industry by providing another reality in which fans can celebrate music. Whether it’s held in Las Vegas, Orlando or somewhere in Brazil, Insomniac will give attendees the musical experience of a lifetime, something the other major-league companies have never been able to do. This innovation and holistic creative world started by a young man with a dream has come to determine and challenge the future of EDM.

News flash, Insomniac is owned by Live Nation. So it’s the same experience either way

When scores of colleges across the country — known as the Coalition for College Access, Affordability and Success — announced the adoption of a website and set of online tools as an alternative to the now-pervasive Common Application, many equity advocates endorsed the deal as a groundbreaking new plan to increase college accessibility for underprivileged youth. And it’s not hard to see why — the system, which would make essential admissions information such as financial aid and application deadlines available to high school students as early as ninth grade, seems to offer a new level of support for students who may not find it elsewhere. And maybe, some proponents profess, the CCA’s new system could finally eradicate the inequity present at every level of a college admissions process which systematically disadvantages poor and minority students.
Well, it’s time for these pure-hearted equity advocates to wake up from their delusional fantasy. A new application process will not erase the institutional education disparity,  which births the inequitable access to, and success in, higher education. Moreover, its selectivity among high schools indicates that it actually advances educational discrepancies overall.
The new college application process functions as a political smokescreen to conceal the systemic inequities that accumulate in higher education. These inequities start even before students enter the education system — children from low-income families are more likely to be food-insecure, less likely to be in center-based childcare and more likely to become depressed. These factors adversely affect students’ educational performance, and as students enter K-12 education, disparities in educational quality widen. Schools in low-income areas suffer from a severe lack of funds, since more than half of schools’ funding sources rely on local property taxes, according to the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development. Efforts to cut costs result in lower quality teachers, more students in classrooms and less breadth or depth of classes offered. These attributes lead to growing disengagement with class curricula. Moreover, in a phenomenon known as the school-to-prison pipeline, low-income and black and brown schools increasingly outsource discipline procedures to local police due to lack of funds. These increase suspension and expulsion rates and lead to a dropout rate that is six times higher than higher-income youth, according to the International Committee of the Fourth International — further disengaging lower income youth and placing them out of a climate of academic success.
So, when these students succeed in spite of the institutional barriers, one would hope that the college admissions process would be equitable. But no — application success relies largely on test scores, which are more of an indicator of socioeconomic status than actual intelligence, and GPA, which is often boosted via Advanced Placement classes that are offered in disproportionately affluent school districts. Moreover, the booming college admissions industry offers specified college admissions counselors, professional essay-writing help and test prep boot camps to students who can afford to shell out the often-thousands of dollars to help maximize their changes in the application process.
To argue that a single application offering students more information on financial aid and application requirements will eliminate these overwhelming barriers for low-income students, then, is a slap in the face to efforts to create an actually equitable process.
It’s not just that the CCA’s efforts aren’t enough to advance opportunities for low-income students. It is actively misleading — considering that the CCA is composed of schools with six-year graduation rates of at least 70 percent, it’s not actually representative of all types of schools, and they may all not be in the reach of low-income students who would not otherwise apply to college. Therefore, it’s much more likely to be good PR for the universities who participate in CCA than an actual incentive to provide students with enough resources to apply to college without external support.
It’s easy to see that the CCA’s new platform will not solve the problems regarding access to higher education, and it’s likely to be an opportunity to profess progress to college access. But whether it will alleviate even some of the burden felt by poor and minority youth trying to apply to college is a much more difficult question to answer. The CCA’s new platform is an improvement over the Common Application — but any platform is an improvement over the Common App. Policymakers need to begin to address the inequities that occur far, far before students encounter the application process in order to make sure that students can even get there.

Recently, more than 80 universities — including all eight Ivy League schools — announced their adoption of an alternative to the traditional college application process. The new application, helmed by the Coalition for Access, Affordability and Success, allows students to develop digital portfolios as early as the beginning of their high school careers. Expected to roll out early next year, the free website levels the playing field for minority and low-income students who might not have access to academic counselors or expensive advisement services. Despite its shortcomings, the online portal creates a mindset that college is, in fact, attainable and is an effort that USC should join.
Undoubtedly, college application season is a stressful period, marked by perfecting standardized test scores, maintaining a high grade point average and honing in on the “dream” school. Some are concerned that if this mentality were to translate over four years, students will be bombarded by an excessive pressure to succeed. Though going to college is not the only indicator of accomplishment, its significance is increasingly becoming a reality. Between 1980 and 2012, college enrollment rates in the United States rose from 26 to 41 percent. And as the job market grows more competitive, it is ultimately educational backing that creates an edge over other candidates. Privileged settings foster this awareness by offering resources.
However, for some minority students, access to college, especially the selective ones, might just be an illusion. The coalition application, in turn, does its best to make clear what students need in order to advance in education. The website allows applicants to work concurrently with their teachers, counselors, other peers and admission officers to create the optimal application profile. The admissions officers are also on hand to give the students advice. These facets of the new platform deviate from the Common Application, which makes the admissions process uniform, but offers no support for the applicant. The immersive process, which will hopefully be used by high schools across the nation, highlights that all schools can be a possibility.
According to a study by labor economist Caroline Hoxby and Harvard University professor Christopher Avery, high-achieving, low-income students tend to not apply to top-tier colleges, despite the fact that these institutions offer more financial aid, and as a result, end up costing less. This is due to K-12 schools’ lack of focus on matriculation and concentration on solely getting the students to high school graduation. Given the opportunity for social reform, notably absent from the list of more than 80 universities is USC.
Though it is commendable that the University has multiple programs — such as Upward Bound, which works with inner-city Los Angeles students — these programs do not reach the vast majority of under-privileged areas in the United States. The coalition application broadens the opportunities for all disadvantaged students. The current college admissions landscape does not cater to the entire applicant pool, particularly those living in underprivileged circumstances. USC needs to adopt the methods put forth by the Coalition for Access, Affordability and Success in order to be a better stepping stone for all students.
