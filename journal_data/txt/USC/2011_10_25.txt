According to the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, 58 percent of Americans favor a heavier emphasis on domestic problems rather than issues overseas, but USC students see the importance of international, domestic and state issues.
The findings, up from 49 percent in 2005, represent a trend across a majority of political groups with traditionally dissimilar views on the United States’ role in the international system. Staunch conservatives, main-street Republicans, Libertarians and hard-pressed Democrats prefer the United States concentrate on problems at home. Solid liberals are the exception, appearing clearly divided on the issue, with 47 percent approving an aggressive international agenda and 47 percent approving a domestically focused agenda.
Americans’ stance against participation in world affairs was most recently reflected in Obama’s decision to pull American troops out of Iraq by the end of this year. The pullout, the president announced Friday, will leave only a small presence of Marine embassy guards and liaison officers in Iraq and will mark the end of heavy involvement in the country.
Historically, Americans have cared less about foreign policy, said Steven Lamy, vice dean for Academic Programs and a professor of international relations.
“Americans tend to be ignorant when it comes to foreign affairs,” Lamy said.
Patrick James, the director of the Center for International Studies and a professor of international relations, attributed the shift in public opinion, however, to the length of the war on terrorism.
“The sheer fatigue of fighting two distant and controversial wars, with the gradual realization that these events may have triggered more changes that will require attention from the United States and its allies,” James said. “Egypt, Tunisia and now Libya have turned over, creating exciting opportunities but also more stress.”
This trend has also been reinforced by an endless supply of bad economic news, James said.
“With the world economy in this condition, and the U.S. as no exception, it is natural for public attention to shift inward,” James said.
Kirby Kojima, a senior majoring in business, said problems like the rising unemployment rate justify a focus on domestic issues, specifically those in California.
“The economy is suffering and the unemployment rate is like 9 percent,” Kojima said. “We have some problems that we need to fix within the state first.”
Keelin Woodell, a senior majoring in theatre, said the focus should be on repairing problems on a local level.
“It’s important to have a good perspective of what’s going on outside of our country and outside of our daily lives; we have enough problems here in Los Angeles that there should at least be some focus on how we can try and fix unemployment and poverty in Los Angeles,” Woodell said.
Vicki Chen, a junior majoring in broadcast journalism, said after the United States addresses its domestic issues it can than begin advancing international policy.
“The United States should take care of its citizens and make sure it is stable and can rebuild from a very low point in our economy before we go and make promises abroad that we can’t keep or that we can’t afford,” Chen said.
Mary Horwath, a first-year graduate student studying law, emphasized the significance of greater diplomacy with other countries.
“There should probably be more of a focus on international issues because I think where we had strong policies in the past, with international relationships with Japan and China, we’ve kind of neglected [them],” Horwath said.
Dorina Ehsanipour, a sophomore majoring in public relations, said the United States should find a balance between its domestic and international policies.
“It’s always important to start inward and fix problems that we have domestically,” Ehsanipour said. “At the same time, I don’t think that people should forget our relationships with other countries abroad. I think [domestic and foreign issues] are important, as long as there’s a balance.”

At 2100 with two hours left on the clock and three given points left to find, a group of USC MS1 cadets on a mission trample through the night with nothing but a compass, pace count, red light and a couple weeks of training to find three out of five small metal poles with a small white placard located more than a mile away from each other. It is their first exposure to what life with the Army Reserve Office Training Corp’s Trojan battalion will be like.

An MS1 cadet, a first-year member of the Army ROTC program, pulls off to the side to rehydrate while another MS1 redraws their route using the military grid reference system.  This is their final test of the night, a chance to show the senior cadets, MS4s, what they have learned. The fall training exercise is not just weekend training, it is a time to set aside the distractions of school and become the leader the U.S. Army expects them to be.
The MS1 cadets, typically freshmen, were not unaccompanied. An MS4 cadet, the equivalent of a senior or a last-year graduate student, accompanied the five MS1 cadets providing them with advice, such as reminding them that hills and uneven terrain alter their pace count and to use a back azimuth, an angular measurement, when they cannot locate the point. The MS4 cadet helped the MS1s locate two of their five points and then let them attempt to find the others on their own. By 2300, the MS1 cadets completed the mission.
The Army ROTC is an officer-commissioning program completed in conjunction with college education. The program either partially or entirely covers the cost of a cadet’s education.
The Army ROTC program is more than just a means to pay for college and preparation for the adversities of combat.
“ROTC is more than the military aspect,” said Maj. Sean Malis, recruiting officer at Cal State Long Beach. “It’s about life lessons and leadership.”
The leadership skills the USC Army ROTC program instills in its MS1, MS2 and MS3 cadets is mostly taught by MS4s. Cadres, army officers in charge of overseeing the entire ROTC, are present, but they only provide support and advice when necessary.
This unique dynamic that arises as students prepare other students to become officers in the Army is integral to the success of the Army ROTC program. The MS1 cadets can more easily relate to the MS4 cadets, who share similar burdens of school work and social life, than the cadre, according to Maj. Donald Hong, an ROTC recruiting officer for Cal State Long Beach and UC Irvine.

“They are the next step of leaders, they are getting ready to lead soldiers,” Hong said. “They have been through the program and know what success looks like.”
MS4 Cadet Michael Scott, a senior majoring in computer engineering and computer science, said it is important for the MS1 and MS2 cadets to be trained by their fellow cadets because it gives them an opportunity to understand the Army.
“Training MS1 and MS2 cadets allows them to see what we do in ROTC and what their role in the army will be,” Scott said. “We also need to get the cadets to want to be a part of the Army.”
MS4 cadets attempt to strike a balance between practical and engaging training and events, Scott said.
“When we plan training exercises and events we make sure they’re both realistic and fun so that cadets have the skills necessary for combat and have a good experience,” Scott said.
When faced with problems, MS1 cadets are given guidance from MS4 cadets, but they are also given room to discover their own solutions and to experience failing — by not finding three out of five points on their own during night navigation, for example, said MS4 cadet Hannah Stryker, a graduate student studying social work.
“As long as the [MS1 cadets] don’t get lost, it’s a good learning experience,” Stryker said. “We try to be helpful while letting them figure things out themselves.”
The effectiveness of MS4s’ leadership skills stem from having been good followers as MS1, MS2 and MS3 cadets, Stryker said. MS1 cadets notice and respect the MS4 cadets’ leadership.
“From the beginning, their main goal has been to make us future leaders,” said MS1 cadet Kyle Wollner, a freshman majoring in East Asian languages and cultures. “We learn to show respect for them so they’ll show respect for us.”
Wollner said the MS4s’ leadership skills serve as motivation for the MS1s.

“The MS4s makes demands of us and we have to complete these [orders] to show respect to them for the sacrifices they make to prepare us to be good leaders,” Wollner said.
MS1 Cadet Tucker Jones, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering, said the MS4s have taught him how to effectively select the individual characteristics of team members when completing a task, such as the field leadership reaction course. During FLRC, teams of cadets need to develop and implement a plan to overcome an obstacle and learn to react and adapt to sudden changes in conditions.
“[MS4s] have taught us to take command and utilize everyone, recognizing their strengths and weaknesses, and utilize those to accomplish the task at hand,” Jones said.
After the fall training exercise, the MS1 cadets have become more integrated into the rich framework of the U.S. Army by their fellow MS4 cadets.
“At the end of the day we are not just fighting for us, but for our fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers,” Stryker said. “We are all brothers held together by a deep tradition.”

The Obama administration announced Tuesday it is proceeding with a new “Pay As You Earn” proposal that would reduce monthly payments for more than 1.5 million college students who currently owe money on student loans.
The proposal will cap college students’ monthly loan payments at 10 percent of their discretionary income. Students would also be forgiven the balance of their debt after 20 years of payments.
This is an expedited version of a measure planned for 2014 in which all borrowers will be able to similarly reduce their payments.
Current law limits borrowers’ payments to 15 percent of their discretionary income and forgives remaining debt after 25 years of consistent payments.
“In a global economy, putting a college education within reach for every American has never been more important,” President Barack Obama said, regarding the proposal.  “But it’s also never been more expensive. That’s why today we’re taking steps to help.”
Additional measures are also being taken to improve the way borrowers can manage their money.
As part of the Know Before You Owe project, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released Monday a Financial Aid Shopping Sheet. This sheet will help students easily compare financial aid packages offered by different institutions. It also makes the total long-term costs of student loans clear to students before they choose to enroll at a specific college.
The United States Small Business Administration and the Young Entrepreneur Council, meanwhile, have each launched programs to help young entrepreneurs with their federal student loan obligations.
The YEC will invest $10 million to pay the remaining student loan obligations of young entrepreneurs across the country.
Pay As You Earn is part of a larger series of executive actions to strengthen the American economy, Obama said.

Santamaria wins ITA Women’s title  
Less than a month into her college tennis career, it appears freshman Sabrina Santamaria is already getting the hang of things.
Santamaria won the ITA Women’s Southwest Regional Tennis Championship in San Diego, Calif., defeating teammate and fellow freshman Zoe Scandalis in straight sets, 6-2, 6-1. The win was Santamaria’s sixth consecutive straight-set singles victory.
With Santamaria’s win, the Women of Troy have now won four straight ITA regional singles championships.
Santamaria was unseeded coming into the tournament but quickly progressed, defeating four top-10 seeds during her run, including No. 10 Scandalis in the final. Santamaria also beat junior Danielle Lao, another member of USC’s women’s tennis team and winner of the event last season. The two met in the quarterfinals with Santamaria winning 3-6, 6-2, 6-4.
Besides the three who made the quarterfinals, the Women of Troy had three players compete in the tournament. Freshman Gabriella DeSimone, senior Alison Ramos and sophomore Kaitlyn Christian all advanced to the round of 32 before getting knocked out.
On the doubles side of the bracket, Christian and Santamaria advanced to the finals before losing to Robin Anderson and Skylar Morton of UCLA. Ramos and Scandalis advanced to the round of 16 before withdrawing.
DeSimone and Lao were paired together but were defeated in the round of 32.
Santamaria will try to stay in top form when USC plays next on Friday at the Jack Kramer Championships in Palos Verdes, Calif.

USC places seventh at championship 
It had been a bumpy start for the USC men’s golf team.
In its first event of the season, the PGA West, USC placed 10th out of 16 teams.
But in the Trojans’ second event of the season, they bounced back, placing seventh at the U.S. Collegiate Championship, which concluded Tuesday at the Golf Club of Georgia in Alpharetta, Ga.
The Trojans led play in the first round and tied for third after the second round. At the conclusion of the tournament, USC finished at 7-over-par (282-288-301). Crosstown rival UCLA took first at 12-under-par. Washington and Auburn tied for second at 9-under-par.
Senior Steve Lim was the highest Trojan finisher. Lim tied for 13th at 1-under-par (66-73-76). He had four bogeys and 14 pars during his final round.
Freshman Anthony Paolucci tied for 31st at 4-over 220 (71-71-81). Paolucci also had back-to-back birdies on nine and 10. Sophomore Jeffrey Kang (73-71-76) and Paolucci both finished 4-over-par. Kang opened his final round with eight pars and finished the final 10 holes at 4-over-par with one birdie.
Martin Trainer tied for 37th at 5-over-par (72-73-76).  The junior began the final round with an eagle on the par-5 first hole. Trainer was 4-under-par through eight holes but finished the back nine at 8-over.
Rounding out the Trojans, sophomore Ramsey Sahyoun tied for 49th at 8-over-par (77-74-73) and recorded the team’s top score in the third round.
The Trojans will head to San Martin, Calif., to compete in the Gifford Collegiate Championship on Monday.
This will mark the final fall event for USC before the team resumes its season in early February.

Blame it on Reggie Bush.
After all, you’d figure he’d be used to it by now, given the heat he’s taken for being the primary cause of USC’s NCAA sanctions.
If it weren’t for Bush and his crowd-wowing play for the Trojans from 2003 to 2005, USC coach Lane Kiffin’s announcement Tuesday that sophomore running back Dillon Baxter will no longer practice with the team wouldn’t have been such a letdown for USC supporters.
Kiffin said in a statement while Baxter won’t be part of the football program, he’s still enrolled academically at USC, leaving the door open for a possible return to the Trojans.
No matter how hard the NCAA tries, it cannot erase images of Bush darting and dashing, weaving and wiggling, and hopping and hurdling through, around and over the top of opposing defenses from the minds of USC fans.
Baxter, like fellow tailback Joe McKnight before him, fell victim to oversized expectations and the burdensome label of “the next Reggie Bush.”
The hype began before he even got to campus. Baxter’s high school stats were so video game-like that EA Sports named him “Mr. Football USA” in 2009. During his senior season at Mission Bay High School in San Diego, Baxter broke the California state record by throwing, running and catching a combined 79 touchdowns in 13 games.
He enrolled early at USC to train with the team during last year’s spring practice and became an instant hit with fans. His scintillating 50-yard touchdown run in a mid-April scrimmage became a YouTube sensation, garnering more than 1.8 million views.
After the scrimmage, Kiffin told reporters that Baxter “looked like Reggie vs. Fresno,” referring to Bush’s record setting game in November of 2005, in which he piled up a Pac-10 record 513 all-purpose yards.
Baxter, following his coach’s lead, bought into the hype too, saying, “It’s crazy just being compared to Reggie. He’s one of the greatest players I’ve ever seen run the ball. I’m excited to show everybody that I can produce the same things that he did.”
Those were powerful words for a player who hadn’t yet suited up for a single collegiate game.
Baxter finished spring practice even with senior tailback Marc Tyler and junior tailback Curtis McNeal on the Trojans’ depth chart, behind seniors Allen Bradford and C.J. Gable.
The then-freshman star continued to impress during fall camp but was suspended for USC’s opener in Hawaii for violating team rules.
Baxter returned for the Trojans’ home win over Virginia, notching 30 carries and five catches in USC’s next three games. He was solid but not explosive (his 75 rushing yards against Washington State in September of last year remain a career high) and found himself in a four-man tailback rotation with Tyler, Bradford and Gable.
The rest of Baxter’s 2010 season was devoid of any real progress on the field (he carried the ball only 29 times in the Trojans’ final nine games) but he continued to make headlines.
Baxter was held out of USC’s November contest against Oregon State after school officials learned last year he had accepted an on-campus golf cart ride from National Football League Players Association-certified agent, who was also a USC student.
USC self-reported the incident, which the school determined was a violation of NCAA rules, and Baxter returned for the following week’s game against Notre Dame. Baxter’s reputation was beginning to take a hit.
Fast-forward to this fall when the departures of Bradford and Gable, combined with Tyler’s suspension for the opener against Minnesota, made Baxter a favorite to open the season as the Trojans’ starter.
By his own admission, however, Baxter didn’t work hard enough during fall camp and didn’t get a single carry in USC’s 19-17 win over Minnesota.
Kiffin’s confidence in Baxter dissipated to the point that the coach took redshirts off freshmen Amir Carlisle and George Farmer (even moving Farmer from wide receiver to running back, a position he never played in high school) rather than give Baxter more carries.
Through seven games, Baxter has rushed for 29 yards on nine attempts. He’s routinely complained to the media about playing time this fall, even having a meeting last month with his parents and Kiffin to discuss why he hasn’t seen the field more.
Kiffin didn’t offer any explanation as to why Baxter will no longer practice with the team and speculating is a fruitless task. Reports have surfaced that Baxter’s girlfriend recently gave birth to the couple’s first child, but it’s unclear if that is related to Kiffin’s announcement.
Baxter has maintained throughout the fall that he hasn’t considered transferring.
Only a sophomore, he still has time to get his academics and family situation in order before making a possible return to the team.
He might still go on to a great career in cardinal and gold.
Perhaps, a fresh start, a change of scenery and a step out of Bush’s shadow might be exactly what Baxter needs to get back to the form that saw him earn those comparisons in the first place.
 
“Sellin’ the Sizzle” runs Wednesdays. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or email Jonathan at jkendric@usc.edu.
 
 
 
Mr. Baxter, here is some cheap advice to add to all the other advice you have been getting.  Try pausing and thinking before you act so that some day you can go crazy on the football field without pausing and thinking.  Know what I mean?
Great article!

Sophomore tailback Dillon Baxter is no longer a member of the USC football team, the school announced Tuesday morning. He does, however, remain enrolled at the school.
Missing in action · Sophomore tailback Dillon Baxter did not travel with USC to South Bend, Ind., where the team faced Notre Dame. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“The decision has been made for Dillon Baxter to focus on his academics,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said in a statement. “As he does so, he will not be part of our football program.  However, we will continue to support him with our academic services department.”
Kiffin did not specify whether Baxter would rejoin the team at some point in the future.
“This [is] all about no distractions,“ Kiffin said. “Our team has had great focus over the past couple of weeks on the road; the last thing that we want to do is get distracted.”
Baxter arrived at USC in 2010 as a highly touted recruit at the running back position but has failed to reach the projected heights, as off-field issues have defined his career.
After the NCAA announced sanctions against USC, Baxter notified USC’s compliance office that several high-profile schools — Alabama, Florida, Fresno State, Oregon and Washington — had illegally contacted him on June 10, 2010, in an effort to lure him away from USC.
But Baxter was not contacted by the schools, and then-USC athletic director Mike Garrett issued an apology as a result.
Baxter was suspended for two contests during the 2010 season. He missed the season opener at Hawaii for an unspecified violation of team rules and served a one-game suspension for accepting a golf cart ride from a student agent.
He did finish with 252 rushing yards and one touchdown on 59 carries in 10 games for the Trojans.
With senior tailback Marc Tyler suspended indefinitely to start the 2011 season, some speculated that Baxter would assume the starting role. But Baxter remained buried in the depth chart behind junior Curtis McNeal and freshman D.J. Morgan.
After the season opener Sept. 3 against Minnesota, where he did not log any carries, Baxter and his parents met with Kiffin to discuss the sophomore’s playing time. Though Baxter said he did not intend to transfer at the time, it appeared he was frustrated with his role.
Baxter’s career took another odd turn last week when he missed practice the Sunday before the Notre Dame game reportedly because of a family issue and eventually did not travel to South Bend, Ind.
Playing in just three games through the first seven contests of the 2011 campaign, Baxter  registered just nine carries for 29 yards this season. For his career, Baxter has 68 carries for 281 yards and one touchdown.
Whether Baxter will wear the cardinal and gold or transfer remains to be seen.
“We’re focused on the guys that are here,” Kiffin said. “We’re focused on getting ready to play maybe the best team in the country.”

It doesn’t get any easier for No. 20 USC.
The Trojans opened the first of three weekly practices Tuesday in preparation for a nationally televised game against No. 4 Stanford at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Saturday after winning their second consecutive road win last week at Notre Dame — their third consecutive victory since a 43-22 loss at Arizona State on Sept. 24.
“I think we feel that mojo, that swagger we need to have on both sides of the ball,” junior quarterback Matt Barkley said. “Because we put together a full game, I think that helps with our overall team confidence, something that we’ll need going into this game.”

Against Notre Dame, Barkley completed 24 of 35 passes for 224 yards and three touchdowns, arguably his best game of the season. Against Stanford, he will face off against the Cardinal’s own top-notch signal caller, Andrew Luck.
So far, Barkley has downplayed the matchup.
“It doesn’t make a difference in how I prepare,” he said. “There’s nothing that he is going to do to stop me and I can’t stop him. We just have to play our game and not worry about that.”
—
Though the Barkley-Luck showdown will likely gain plenty of attention, USC’s defense has quietly looked much improved in recent weeks.
Last week also marked improvement for the oft-maligned defensive unit, holding Notre Dame to a season-low 41 yards on the ground.
“The easiest place to tackle is going to be right up the middle,” senior linebacker Chris Galippo said. “If we’re sound up front and in the middle of our defensive core, we will play better as a unit.”
Galippo credits the younger players’ preparation and gameday executions by the younger players for the team’s recent success.
“All together, our team defense is probably the best it has been since I have been here,” Galippo said.
—
USC coach Lane Kiffin stated that much of the Trojans’ recent offensive production can be credited to the chemistry between Barkley and sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods.
“You have two kids that really work at being great,” Kiffin said. “They have the same mentality whether we are there or not.”
Barkley and Woods hope to have a repeat of their performance at last year’s game against Stanford.
“Last year, I think a lot of things clicked for our offense,“ Barkley said. “Our tempo was fast, we were getting the ball out and he [Woods] was really making plays.”
Kiffin hopes Barkley will maintain his focus despite the hype leading up to the game on Saturday.
“Right now it is just about preparing,” Kiffin said. “We have to make sure that he continues to play the same way and doesn’t try to force it.”
—
Freshman kicker Andre Heidari was limited in practice Tuesday after suffering an injury to his right ankle Saturday against Notre Dame. The injury occurred during the Notre Dame kickoff return.
“It’s just a deep bruise,” Heidari said. “I’ll be out here kicking tomorrow so we’ll see how it feels.”
Woods and redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris did not practice today. According to Kiffin, Woods is suffering from multiple injuries that have not been disclosed.
“Robert didn’t practice today and hopefully he will be healthy this week,” Kiffin said. “Outside of that, I think he has played really well.”
Kiffin credits Woods’ size and ability for his versatility on the field.
The only point in the game where Luck & Barkley will meet face to face is the coin flip.

· Sophomore cornerback Torin Harris did not practice. Nor did sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods. Coach Lane Kiffin would not elaborate on Woods’ injuries; simply saying “he has multiple.”
· Freshman running back George Farmer was carted off the practice field with what looked to be a leg injury.
· Kiffin was mum on the Dillon Baxter issue. He repeated that he would not comment any further than his statement released earlier today, where he said that Baxter was not currently “part of our football program” as the sophomore focuses on his academics.
· “We’re focused on the guys that are here. We’re focused on getting ready to play maybe the best team in the country,” said Kiffin.
· Naturally, everyone was asking about Stanford star quarterback Andrew Luck, thought by many as the best prospect since Peyton Manning and an apparent shoo-in to be the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL draft.
· “We respect each other’s games,” said junior quarterback Matt Barkley. “I hope he looks up to me; I look up to him. There’s that mutual respect which carries a long way.”
· “He’s very, very smart,” said defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin of Luck. “He checks the line of scrimmage. He’s very good at reading the coverages and the whole deployment of your fronts.”
· Monte also lamented, only half-jokingly, that Luck didn’t leave for the NFL last year. “He could have been great,” Kiffin said with a smile. “What’s he still doing in college.”

Don’t let all the gray hues at ink. fool you. Despite the painted brick, the chalkboards and the steel tabletops, your meal will be far more varied and colorful, as seen in ink.’s famous turnip dish, which also includes coffee-cardamom soil, frozen yogurt “snow” and sliced radishes.
Eat your greens · Many of Voltaggio’s dishes include unlikely combinations, such as the popular seaweed mashed potatoes. - Bernard Leed | Daily Trojan
 
It’s indicative of Top Chef winner Michael Voltaggio’s ambition. The food does the talking, and a lot of it.
The turnip dish is served like a salad in a simple bowl — experimental on paper but presented approachably. And the flavors, as patrons will realize from the first succulent, charred turnip, are far from intimidating.
The first entirely successful dish is spaghetti with squid and hazelnut pesto. It’s served over a small bed of squash and topped with a wafer-like cracker. This is the flavorful, textural fusion that Voltaggio’s Top Chef judges would praise effusively. It will be a delight for diners to finally taste cooking that formerly existed only on their TV screens.
Voltaggio’s octopus tastes more like sausage than seafood and is placed on a buttered popcorn puree. The puree’s creaminess separates it texturally from actual popcorn, but makes it every bit as flavorful and also a more worthy companion to the chewy octopus. Also served with sweet piquillo peppers, the octopus is the least interesting element on the plate. But these familiar flavors in such an unusual combination will simultaneously comfort and intrigue diners.
Other dishes like quail with a beet jus suffer from “too-muchness” — the dish is dominated by vinegar foam that couldn’t even be mellowed by a side of banana.
For what it’s worth, the quail is cooked to perfection — a slight chew while not tasting too gamey.
Veal cheek is served with salt-baked carrots. Sweet red curry and pasty rice on the side nearly ruins the dish. But for those defenseless against a perfectly cooked carrot, the dish will satisfy nonetheless. The mouth-watering tenderness of the veal cheek is the dish’s other saving grace.
Most dishes are like the quail and the veal cheek: delicious in parts but just shy of greatness. With neighbors like acclaimed Melrose mainstays Lucques and Comme Ça, ink. might have to work a little harder to compete.
What separates this restaurant in general is its balanced concept.
Though ink.’s food isn’t exceptional, it succeeds where few other “experimental” restaurants do. Voltaggio’s food makes patrons question the limits of their palette without pomp or forcefulness. In this sense, the restaurant is quietly sophisticated and intelligent.
The portions are small but not tapas-sized, which is to say they are simultaneously satisfying and fairly priced. Most dishes run around $14, and the food is unusual enough that it’s worth the price of a few plates. One would be hard pressed to find these combinations anywhere else in Los Angeles.
As communicative as the flavors might be, the wait staff is less so. One of the many servers will explain the complex components of dishes (such as the frozen-yogurt “snow”), but too often you’ll still be left wondering what’s in your dish.  Mediocre service is a common pitfall of new restaurants, but since ink. executes so well in other areas, this is especially noticeable.
Fortunately, ink.’s meals end on a strong note. The dishes that work perfectly are, surprisingly, its desserts.
Ink.’s apple crème caramel is impressive from the moment it arrives. Ordered hesitantly at the insistence of the bartender, who also recommended some bland seaweed mashed potatoes, the dessert presented can hardly be described as a crème caramel at all.
With the apple playing the star of the plate and a smoky crumble sprinkled throughout, the dessert takes one’s taste buds into a wonderfully savory place. The apples taste freshly cut, not like something extracted from a pie, providing a crispness that lightens the dessert where it could feel heavy — finally, a dish that achieves Voltaggio’s quest for balance between the experimental and the comforting.
The dessert tastes like fall, but you’ll want to eat it any time of year.
In the end, ink. is just shy of perfection, but Voltaggio’s quirky concoctions and the superb desserts make it a restaurant well worth a try.

Watching scary movies, partying at raves or blasting blood-curdling sound effects at haunted houses aren’t the only ways to spend Halloween.
For those who don’t have the time or interest to go meandering through haunted houses or dancing at crowded clubs, there are a few scary video games that can get your heart pounding in no time.
In no particular order, here are three of the most terrifying games that will leave you begging to keep the light turned on when your roommate comes home.
Dead Space (2008)
Ever wonder what it would feel like to fight an army of monsters in one of the scariest settings in the universe? In Dead Space, players assume the persona of Isaac Clarke, an engineer who has landed on a space mining ship with orders to fix its communication system. But, as Clarke, you soon discover the entire crew has been infected with an alien mutation, transforming them into maniacal creatures called Necromorphs, who are hell-bent on making you their next meal.
Taking place in the darkest ends of space, the setting is as menacing as it gets: It’s dark, claustrophobic and eerily reminiscent of the Alien movies.
Staying true to location, some of the areas in the spaceship lack gravity, forcing you to create your own path amid shadows on the walls and ceilings.
But the atmosphere alone isn’t everything. Critics and consumers have ranked Dead Space’s creative, combative, gameplay two thumbs up. To survive, players must forge improvised weapons out of whatever they can find — anything from guns to buzz saws. But successfully killing Necromorphs requires violent dismemberment, resulting in horrifyingly graphic and tricky assaults easily worth a good gasp or two.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent (2011)
When it comes to bloodthirsty, zombie-like monsters, video games usually prepare us for battle by stocking us up with artillery.
But what happens when the hero is weaponless and all you can do is run for your life?
In Amnesia: The Dark Descent, a first-person, horror/adventure game, players become the eyes and ears of an amnesiac named Daniel, who wakes up in a seemingly deserted castle. What you soon discover, however, is danger is everywhere, and any of the winding paths might lead you closer to one of the many bumbling monsters haunting the corridors.
The most interesting aspect of the game is the lack of weapons — when confronted with a raging monster, your only options are to run, hide or use your wits to avoid being slaughtered.
On top of that, Daniel is an unfortunately unreliable character. Staying in the dark for too long causes Daniel to lose his sanity in the form of unintelligible muttering, wacky camera angles and hallucinogenic visions. Unlike Dead Space, the setting in Amnesia is enough to startle you into switching on a nightlight before your mind begins to follow Daniel’s footsteps.
Limbo (2010)
If you’re looking for something frightening, but not so realistically grotesque or “in-your-face” terrifying as Dead Space and Amnesia, Limbo is the perfect alternative.
In Limbo, players take on the role of a nameless, little boy trying to find his sister in a fascinatingly disturbing 2-D, virtual world. But this 2-D platformer has a twist: Unlike most games typical of the genre, Limbo is music-less and colorless, and its protagonist lacks both a backstory and a weapon of choice. All these features help establish a spine-chilling and desolate environment children and adults alike can enjoy.
In contrast to most contemporary horror games, Limbo is less about killing bad guys and more about solving puzzles without falling victim to otherworldly hazards.
Though game play is relatively simple, don’t let the childish graphics fool you. The puzzles are ridiculously hard to decipher, and the death sequences that accompany failed missions are utterly disturbing. With every failed challenge, you are forced to watch as the boy gets decapitated, dismembered, impaled or electrocuted. It’s not so much about how realistic the graphics are as it is about the innocent, childlike fantasy element that ultimately elevates this game to a top-notch experience.
You don’t have to be a gamer to sit down and enjoy the fear these games will engender. As college students, we might not be children anymore, but that doesn’t mean we’re too old for some fun and games on Halloween night.

If you’re looking for a thrilling, hair-raising way to get into the Halloween spirit, look no further than Delusion, a one-of-a-kind, interactive “haunted” play. Running through Halloween, Delusion takes place in a historic mansion on Harvard Boulevard in West Adams, just a few blocks from USC.
Gripping ghouls · Delusion’s terror is accentuated by its actors’ raw abilities to break the fourth wall and interact with unsuspecting spectators. - Photo courtesy of Delusion
 
Unlike a typical haunted house, Delusion has a full plotline, making the experience a performance that thrusts the audience right into the action, successfully achieving the interaction many other Halloween attractions, like Knott’s Berry Farm’s Halloween Haunt, merely feign.
Set at a conspicuous mansion in a quiet neighborhood, Delusion tells the disturbing story of a delusional psychiatric doctor who goes too far in experimental treatments, resulting in a haunting madhouse of lunatics.
Audience members are led into the house in small groups with Charles, the unwilling tour guide who introduces himself and explains the ghastly situation at hand, issuing caveats about dangerous and disturbing characters who lurk around every turn and corner.
The actor playing the role of Charles exudes authentic trepidation — not an easy task in the face of a group of giggling and screaming playgoers.
As patrons progress through the mansion, they encounter eclectic and terrifying “mental patients,” most of whom are bloodthirsty, with each one more bone chilling than the next.
Audience members are also chased by a cannibalistic brute, seduced by a psychotic nymphomaniac, attacked by a deformed giant, mocked by a possessed little girl and tormented by many other characters until they reach the basement where they meet the delusional doctor and his latest creations in the scream-inducing climax of the play.
One of the standouts from the blood-curdling bunch is a rotund, knife-wielding woman who sits spectators down at an ornate kitchen table to dine. The proviso: She scouts a member of the audience — which, during my experience, happened to be me — as her meal.
Much to my delight, I made it out alive, but as she cooed her detailed plans to dismember me in my ear and slid the side of her glinting butcher knife across my shoulder, I swear I saw my life flash before my eyes. That brings me to another of Delusion’s highlights: The actors are allowed to touch you.
And touch you they will. Participants will be grabbed, petted, poked and prodded by actors, catapulting the experience to a whole new level of terror.
Frightening characters can reach and point to their heart’s content, but factor in physical contact, and the fourth wall suddenly dissolves, making the play seem more real and horrifying.
Furthermore, the actors’ makeup and costumes are superbly grotesque and authentic. From the blind brute, with bloody sockets in place of his eyes carrying around a remarkably realistic human head on a stake, to the monstrous baby with a face rivaling Chucky’s, each character is crafted meticulously from head to toe with no limits on the gross factor.
Photo courtesy of Delusion
The play also features remarkable special effects, such as characters dangling from the ceiling and being dragged across the floor by unseen forces.
The only downside, at first, is the price: At $40 a ticket, it might seem a bit expensive for a half-hour-long show. But in the end, it’s well worth it.
All in all, the performance is exhilarating, scream inducing and truly unique — so much so that it will make viewers want to crawl back for more.
Be advised, however, it’s not for the faint of heart. If you’re looking for a family-friendly, lighthearted Halloween activity, steer clear of Delusion and stick to trick-or-treating. If you crave a substantial dose of adrenaline-pumping fear, guaranteed to make you scream, definitely check out the haunted play.
Just be sure to use the bathroom beforehand.

Despite the positive images the title might evoke, Oranges and Sunshine is a sobering drama investigating the true story of Margaret Humphreys (Emily Watson) and the child migrant scheme that occurred between England and Australia in the ’50s and ’60s. The film, directed by Jim Loach, is set in 1986 and revolves around Margaret, who gains public acclaim by bringing former child migrants to peace with their rough pasts.

As Margaret comes into contact with people who had been separated from their families and homes and sent to Australia in their youth, she becomes more determined to uncover the cause of these forced child migrations. Margaret comes to discover that, during the ’50s and ’60s, thousands of impoverished, orphaned children in England were put on boats, sent to Australia and used for free labor, specifically at a Christian school called Bindoon. The more time Margaret spends in Australia, the bigger a toll it takes on her family life and her public perception.
Such is the not-so-sunny story of Oranges and Sunshine.
Though the film operates on an intriguing and refreshing premise, the script has major flaws. The pacing feels imbalanced: The first half hour of the film flies by, but the remainder of the film doesn’t accomplish much.
And once Margaret begins traveling to Australia and gaining publicity, the storyline repeats itself with different people — she meets former child migrants, hears their stories and tries to track down their long-lost parents to bring them peace.
A rather promiscuous but important secret about Bindoon is revealed late in the film and is not properly dealt with in the end. The ending also seems forged and awkwardly inconclusive — as if screenwriter Rona Munro is starting to tell us a juicy secret, but then stops mid-sentence.
However, the script does have some redeeming qualities. The premise is strong, and the characters, such as the zany Len (David Wenham) and the heavy-hearted Jack (Hugo Weaving) are three-dimensional, heartwarming and sometimes even tear-inspiring.
Wenham gives a standout portrayal of Len, an ex-child migrant who has searched for years to find his mother — and later challenges Margaret to find his mother for him.
The character begins as somewhat of an obnoxious jerk and could have easily been presented as unlikable. But in the hands of Wenham, Len’s outlandish behavior is understandable, making him even more likable when he finally begins to soften.
Weaving also delivers an excellent performance as Jack, the estranged brother of one of Margaret’s patients. Weaving gives a raw, touching and, at times, hard-to-swallow performance.
And of course, lest we forget Watson: She is undoubtedly a strong actress whose determination and feistiness drive the bulk of the movie. Her character, however, errs on the side of irksome as the film progresses, mostly because she becomes unstable and cries in nearly every scene in the latter half of the movie. But to be fair, Watson’s melodrama has more to do with the script problems than her ability to act.
Perhaps the heart of the film’s problems lies in the fact that it was advertised as an uplifting, inspirational tale, yet in reality it is far more raw. Audiences, because of the trailers and advertisements, are probably more prepared to see Erin Brockovich.
Unlike the glossy, uplifting machine of mainstream American cinema, Oranges and Sunshine stays true to the raw essence of the child migrant scheme; whether for better or worse is for the viewer to decide. It’s not a glamorized, romantic version of the child migrant scheme — in that way it is distinctly un-American.
In the end, Oranges and Sunshine has noticeable flaws, but still delivers strong performances and raw, thought-provoking sequences.

It’s not uncommon to hear electronic dance music blasting from the speakers of a car, dorm or frat party these days.
The rise of new DJs and producers, such as Deadmau5 and Avicii, is catapulting electronic dance music to the top of music charts, with electronic dance music tracks infiltrating airwaves and bringing back a culture that condones bright colors and the slogan “Peace, love, unity and respect.”
But this couldn’t have been possible without the work of past DJs and producers who set the standard for electronic music decades ago. Among those figures is Fatboy Slim — also known as Norman Cook — a British DJ and electronic music veteran. Cook will be a headliner at this year’s Hard Haunted Mansion, an annual electronic dance music extravaganza, set to take place at the Shrine Auditorium on Oct. 28 and 29.
Taking his place among newer acts like Skrillex and Laidback Luke, Cook bridges the gap between British and American cultures and electronic dance newbies and veterans.
Cook has not played a show in Los Angeles in four years, but he is still aware of the growth of the electronic music scene and the difference between the culture here in America and his home in England — especially when it comes to events like Hard.
“Anyone who can put on big dance events in America and get away with it is doing something good because you have the worst time persuading your government and the people to go out and party,” Cook said. “I’ve been hearing there’s this conservative attitude towards people listening to electronic dance music. It’s exciting for us in England to see big things finally happening in America.”
Cook’s music career has spanned over a decade and his appearance at Hard marks a new point in an already lengthy and successful career. Electronic music has grown into a new beast since Cook first started making music, and his appearance at Hard only cements his contribution to this evolution.
“I’m just happy I’m still allowed to do it. I’m part of the wave of DJs who were taken seriously and given respect,” Cook said. “If you’re in a boy band, by the time you’re old, you’re done, but DJs don’t really rely on their looks.”
Especially in America, electronic dance music has gone through an ebb and flow of popularity. The scale of events like Hard shows that the current interest in dance music has exploded. But Cook knows from experience that this most likely won’t last long.
“It’s just another wave. The last time it was happening it was me and the Chemical Brothers riding the last wave,” Cook said. “Now it’s more to do with people like David Guetta and Swedish House Mafia.”
For his performance at Hard, Cook naturally wants to give a stellar show.
“I’m effectively a VJ as much as [a] DJ. As I play the tunes, I’m also playing the visuals. We want it to be a visual extravaganza,” Cook said. “Someone at a Hong Kong show told me, ‘You made people that weren’t on drugs feel like they were,’ and that’s the best compliment.”
Hard Haunted Mansion is one of the best places for this type of experience. Cook has the sophistication of a seasoned electronic dance music icon and his presence at Hard is sure to prove he has retained the skills that have gotten him to where he is now.
The music scene might continue to change, but there is something unique and even magical about standing alongside hundreds of other people on Halloween weekend and swaying to the sounds of electronic dance music at its loudest and boldest. The electronic dance scene won’t stay this strong forever — if Cook’s capricious career is any indication — but it’ll at least be an experience while it lasts.

The first time I applied for financial aid, I was appropriately terrified. The crazy forms with a barrage of unfamiliar financial jargon are daunting enough. Add parental pressure, supplemental paperwork and endless deadlines into the mix, and your average high school senior will want to run away screaming.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
 
I tried to be levelheaded about it. Millions of other students had done it before me; it couldn’t possibly be that bad. So I spent a few weeks gathering financial data from my parents, making lists of contact information and submission dates and typing numbers into tiny data fields on an unforgiving computer screen.
Somewhere in the process, I came across the official Free Application for Federal Student Aid financial aid calculator, otherwise known as the FAFSA4caster, which promised to provide me with an estimate of how much financial aid I would receive if I spent just a little more time inputting numbers.
It was a bust. The online tool, which came highly recommended by college counselors and the FAFSA website, informed me I could expect a grand total of zero dollars and zero cents in financial aid.
USC’s recent addition of its own financial aid calculator to the admissions website won’t help matters. Financial aid calculators are more of a hindrance than a help to college students.
These problems are more likely to impact incoming college freshman — the newbies in the financial aid process — but experienced  students are not immune. Current college students, more than anyone, cannot afford to either waste their very limited time on a financial tool that probably won’t affect what they do next or worse, that will mess up their financial aid situation at a college they are already happily attending on account of putting too much stock in a calculator because they are not truly indicative of how much aid a student will receive.
The Internet is flooded with them — most financial aid and college prep websites will have their own version or link you to one elsewhere. They either put students in a panic over a calculation for minimal aid, or leave them with a false sense of security thanks to an overly huge one. Either way, they are a waste of time.
Tools like the FAFSA4caster can’t guarantee accuracy, particularly for those with more unique financial situations. They are terrible at taking into account special circumstances, such as custodial arrangements, exceptional medical bills or significant depreciation of assets.
As rudimentary mathematical programs, they are not able to interpret that sort of information. So unless your situation is free of complication, you might as well not use a financial aid calculator.
College students who do bother to use a financial aid calculator will tell you its results had absolutely no bearing on whether they decided to apply for financial aid. No student who legitimately requires outside funding for college is going to change his or her mind about applying for financial aid because of a low estimate on an unproven calculator.
It might push him or her a little further in the direction of seeking out scholarships, or maybe getting a job, but any person who would take the time to punch data into a financial aid calculator is probably already taking those steps.
There are only a few possible changes an advance estimate can make, and none of them is particularly good.
The first is that a student expends unnecessary time and energy stressing for several months over whether he or she will receive enough financial aid, instead of focusing on academic work or perhaps seeking other avenues to obtain funds. In the worst case scenario, such students convince themselves they cannot afford to attend certain schools without contacting those schools’ financial aid offices.
Some might even feel compelled to unfairly manipulate financial data when filling out their forms, which could land them in serious trouble.
On the other hand, students might feel so confident about high financial aid estimates that they choose not to take advantage of other opportunities to receive college funding. This can have dire consequences later, especially if the estimate turns out to be higher than expected.
Student financial aid resources should instead direct student attention toward alternative methods of college aid. Scholarship search engines could provide a useful tool to gather money to fund increasingly expensive tuition. Websites like FastWeb and CollegeBoard should come to the forefront of financial aid service as a useful and effective way to ease an otherwise stressful process.
Providing tools to help students better understand the technical aspects of the financial aid process is another viable solution. High school college counseling offices could put together detailed tutorials to help their students secure the maximum financial aid possible, without using financial aid calculators as a crutch.
If financial aid calculators don’t cause legitimate problems, they still create a nuisance — the last thing anyone needs to worry about is the biggest expense of one’s life. Financial aid is complicated enough on its own. It doesn’t need an calculator making it even more so.

Since the Occupy movement started a month ago, it has struggled with claims that it is unfocused. Critics of the protests say that while the protests show that a section of the population is dissatisfied with the current state of affairs, protestors are not achieving anything beyond disruption.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
 
Despite its detractors, the movement has endured and flourished by rallying around its slogan, “We are the 99 percent,” which refers to the estimate that 1 percent of the United States population holds 40 percent of the country’s wealth.
The movement has reached our campus on two fronts: Students have organized trips to the Occupy Los Angeles rallies outside Los Angeles City Hall, to show their support for the original movement, and students have vowed to remain in front of Tommy Trojan every weekday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., to stage their own version of the protests that will soon focus on issues related to USC. The Occupy USC General Assembly plans to announce those goals on Friday.
This latter group, no doubt sharing members with the first, has managed to do something the original group has been unable to do: It sat down after its first occupation ended on Monday and delineated goals for its protest.
The movement as a whole has spread so energetically because of its refusal to commit to specific reasons that explains why protesters are dissatisfied with the government and the supposed corporate greed of Wall Street.
Yes, a large portion of America is disappointed. But watching footage of the original protests in New York, the problem becomes clear: People are united in their displeasure, but only this unites them.
Some protesters complain about health insurance, some about bank loans, some about corporations and some about the war. These masses are united in dissatisfaction under the powerful, unifying force of the 99 percent.
What better way to feel support in your hardship than to hear that 99 percent of people share your pain?
Because of the divided attentions of the group and the lack of direction this fosters, the power of this movement to effect change is limited.
Protesters have the power to collect thousands behind their cause. The only problem is that, besides saying things must change, there isn’t much of a change.
The sheer number of people now behind the movement all but guarantees the impossibility of forging a pointed direction to creating change without a clear articulation of goals and means to achieve those goals.
The USC students inspired by the movement, however, do have a plan for success, albeit on a much smaller scale.
They join the masses nationwide in expressing their disappointment with the status quo. And by meeting and determining goals as a group, the members have potential to cause change in regard to campus issues.
Declarations of a democratic awakening or images of crowds creating human megaphones are idealized, and they will no doubt form a large portion of the stories told about the Occupy movement.
Its true merit, however, doesn’t lie in what it accomplishes by itself; its greatest potential lies in the way it inspires these more efficient small-scale movements, which can actually bring about concrete improvement.
The organizers of Occupy USC have talked about inspiring other California schools with their actions.
It is this kind of influence that can bring about change reminiscent of the Arab Spring that inspired the Occupy movement. The same cannot be said for those camping for days in a park.

Recently, there’s been a lot of Zooey Deschanel to go around. The actress turned singer-songwriter premiered her new television show, The New Girl, on Fox, just sang the national anthem at a World Series game and is now ushering in the Christmas season with a new album from fan favorites She & Him — and we haven’t even celebrated (Hard) Halloween yet!
While it seems Justin Bieber is relentlessly trying to snag the 2011 holiday music crown away from all other competitors, if you’re into more mellow, classic Christmas tunes, then She & Him’s A Very She & Him Christmas is more your cup of tea.
The duo released the first single off of the album Oct. 10. “The Christmas Waltz” set the tone for what She & Him fans and jolly Christmas enthusiasts could expect from the new album: simple, honest and tender performances of yule-tide favorites.
A Very She & Him Christmas, which dropped yesterday, boasts 12 songs that are perfectly seasoned holiday tracks.
The set opens with the single “The Christmas Waltz” and keeps a steady pace till the end. “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” has an interesting guitar riff behind Deschanel’s soothing, mature voice. Its got that nice, cozy-by-the-fire feeling going on and makes you want to snuggle up with a warm mug of cocoa.
Deschanel’s voice is clearly a driving point of the music. Her oldies-inspired tone shines on “I’ll Be Home for Christmas” and “The Christmas Song.” But M. Ward’s production is also key in the winning She & Him holiday formula. M. Ward has crafted beautifully simple and endearing arrangements that are in no way sappy and obnoxious — as some holiday tunes can tend to be. He’s found a definite niche in creating beautiful, artistic recreations of the holiday classics.
But if Deschanel’s voice is great by itself, when the duo sings together and harmonizes, sparks fly. “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” is the greatest example of the duo’s chemistry and artistry.
All in all, there’s no better way to start the Christmas season than with She & Him. But, it’s such a heartwarming album that you might just want to wait until the dust has settled from Hard before breaking open this early Christmas present.

The following former Trojans registered action in the NFL on Sunday:
 
• New York Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez (18/33 passing, 173 yards, three touchdowns and an interception in a 27-27 home win over the San Diego Chargers)
• NYJ running back Joe McKnight (three carries, 11 yards; three kickoffs, 79 yards; one punt return, seven yards)
• NYJ wide receiver Patrick Turner
• San Diego Chargers cornerback Shareece Wright
• Carolina Panthers center Ryan Kalil (The run game was effective once more as Kalil and his linemen led Cam Newton to a great day in victory, 33-20, over Washington, although Newton was sacked four times)
• Washington Redskins tight end Fred Davis (six catches, 80 yards, one score)
• Atlanta Falcons offensive tackle Sam Baker (Baker did not play, but the Falcons won. Matt Ryan was sacked three times with no Baker in a 23-16 victory)
• Detroit Lions defensive end Kyle Moore
• Detroit DE Lawrence Jackson (four tackles, half a sack)
• Cleveland Browns linebacker Kaluka Maiava (two tackles in an ugly 6-3 victory)
• Cleveland TE Jordan Cameron
• Seattle Seahawks TE Anthony McCoy (two catches, ten yards)
• Seattle TE Dominique Byrd
• Seattle WR Mike Williams (one catch, ten yards)
• Seattle CB Josh Pinkard
• Miami Dolphins RB Reggie Bush (Bush had ten carries for 42 yards: a decent number. But the Dolphins could not outlast the Tebow effect and lost 18-15 in overtime)
• Houston Texans LB Brian Cushing (Cush had six tackles, a tackle for loss and a pass deflection in a one-sided game, 41-7, over the Titans)
• Houston defensive tackle Shaun Cody
• Tennessee Titans DT Jurrell Casey (two tackles, one for loss)
• Kansas City Chiefs QB Matt Cassel (Cassel had an ugly game, but not as ugly as the two Oakland signal callers. Cassel went 15/30 and gained 161 yards and threw two interceptions in a KC-defense-heavy match, 28-0)
• Oakland Raiders TE David Ausberry (one tackle)
• Former Heisman trophy winner made his debut in an Oakland uniform in the second half. He completed 8 of 21 attempts for 116 yards and threw three interceptions.
• Pittsburgh Steelers safety Troy Polamalu (The long-haired man only had three tackles, but the Steelers easily beat Arizona, 32-20)
• Green Bay Packers LB Clay Matthews (Matthews had six tackles, a sack, two tackles for loss and one pass defended as the Packers won a close one against the rival Vikings, 33-27)
• Minnesota Vikings DE Everson Griffen (four tackles, one sack, one tackle for loss)
• Dallas Cowboys OT Tyron Smith (The Dallas offensive line opened holes left and right so rookie DeMarco Murray could run all over St. Louis. Murray had 253 yards, and Romo was kept clean as Dallas romped the Rams, 34-7)
• Dallas kicker David Buehler
• New Orleans Saints OT Charles Brown (Brown and the Saints line only allowed two sacks, but that got list in Drew Brees’ sublime passing performance. The Saints were the first time since the 1970 merger to drop 60+ points in a regular season game, annihilating the Colts 62-7)
• Indianapolis Colts DT Fili Moala (two tackles, one for loss)
• Indianapolis CB Kevin Thomas (Thomas got a lot of work, which is not good for a cornerback, as he had ten tackles and a pass defended)
 
Players on a bye week
• Cincinnati Bengals S Taylor Mays
• Cincinnati LB Rey Maualuga
• Cincinnati LB Keith Rivers
• Cincinnati DE Frostee Rucker
• San Francisco 49ers guard Chili Rachal
