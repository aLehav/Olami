Agatha Christie is currently the it girl of the Hollywood script.
The iconic novelist’s literary capital has, in recent years, taken on a life of its own on the big screen. The Agatha Christie-verse has been racking in high box office numbers with faithful adaptations of her novels, like Kenneth Branaugh’s 2017 and 2022 films “Murder on the Orient Express” and “Death on the Nile,” or with love letters to her work like Rian Johnson’s hit film-turned-franchise “Knives Out.” 
“See How They Run” is the newest addition to the serial lineup of mystery flicks hitting theaters in light of the Christie cinematic renaissance. In a solid directorial debut, British television native Tom George rounds up an ensemble of critically acclaimed thespian actors, led by duo Sam Rockwell and Saoirse Ronan, and stages them in a nostalgia-enhanced whodunnit spectacle set in London’s West End theater district in the 1950s. When sleazy Hollywood producer Leo Köpernick (Adrien Brody), is murdered backstage in the theater housing the play he hopes to produce for the screen, “The Mousetrap,” based on the work of, you guessed it, Agatha Christie, Inspector Stoppard, played by Rockwell, is recruited to take on the case with the unwelcomed help of the film-obsessed amateur cop Constable Stalker, played by Ronan.
While the demise of Brody’s character takes center stage in the story, the ghost of another Hollywood director haunts the screen. It very well may be that Wes Anderson is the real murder victim of “See How They Run,” with split frames and quirky editing to Technicolor costumes and stock characters plucked straight out of “The Grand Budapest Hotel” being the film’s main attraction. Even a cast of Anderson regulars take top credits on the billing and are up to their usual eccentric quirkiness.
Ronan gave a standout comedic performance as the earnest self-deprecating cop in training that once again proves the versatility of the four-time Academy Award nominee. Rockwell does good with what he is given, his sleuth character not necessarily upstaging Ronan’s despite having the upper hand in their professional nose-sniffing, but the two actors do share a sweet chemistry. David Oyelowo as Mervyn, Köpernick’s screenwriting nemesis over creative differences, is a dapper addition to the ensemble of BAFTA favorites — and like many of the actors, he’s obviously having a good time being there.
“See How They Run” directly speaks to lovers of the whodunnit film, literally addressing its audience in the prologue to make sure they, in fact, are aware that they are seated to witness yet another murder mystery unfold. “You’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all,” is the repeated line directed towards the story’s plot centerpiece, “The Mousetrap,” but in a meta fashion, the film carries an attitude of self-awareness that continuously winks towards its audience. 
Very much so, “See How They Run” is another murder mystery to hit screens, but it’s still a thrilling ride. It occasionally gets lost in its twists and turns along the way, but it pieces together its puzzle with a satisfying finale. With its quick and easy runtime of 98 minutes, the film rarely drags, striking a balance between a sit-back-in-your-seat viewing experience whilst keeping you on your toes. There’s a reason why Christie’s books made her the best-selling novelist of all time: the formula works.
“See How They Run” is by no means original, nor does it evolve the genre in as clever a fashion as “Knives Out” did, but it never tries to be anything else than what it is: a murder mystery. It delivers an array of finger-pointing moments a la Leonardo Dicaprio in “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” style. Mystery lovers and Christie admirers will be satisfied by the film’s indulgence in whodunnit conventions. Unintentionally for cinephiles, they could very well be thrilled at the abundance of Anderson-isms, either happily spewing out film knowledge like Constable Stalker or leaving the theater fuming that George was able to steal the director’s signature style and get away with petty crime. If you identify with one, two or none of these identities as an audience member, you are guaranteed to flash a finger at the screen at one point. “See How They Run” is a solid viewing experience and a fun time at the movies, and that is all it needs to be.

Rain in Los Angeles is rare. But this weekend, South Central was drenched in an even more distinctive kind of reign: the rhinestoned, high-heeled domination of drag’s A-listers. “The Werq the World Tour” sashayed into the Shrine Auditorium Friday night, featuring a lineup of nine drag queens from popular reality competition show “RuPaul’s Drag Race.”
Now sporting 14 regular seasons, seven All Stars seasons and so many international spinoffs that even “Drag Race” superfans like myself find it hard to keep up, the franchise has taken the world by storm and pushed drag further into mainstream public consciousness than ever before.
As its title suggests, “Werq the World” is yet another entry in “Drag Race”’s worldwide domination: the L.A. stop was the 50th of the North American leg, and the 85th since the tour began. The lineup of queens varies by city, and the L.A. show saw a mix of established names and new faces taking center stage.
Jaida Essence Hall — winner of “Drag Race” season 12 and recent contestant on the all-winner season, All Stars 7 — kicked off the show with a high-energy dance performance, then taking on the role of emcee to welcome the crowd and introduce the show.
Essence Hall convincingly explained that the central set piece, a large staircase encircled by glowing lights, was a time machine set to take the audience through history. The queens then took the stage one-by-one, each delivering a lip-sync performance themed around a different time period. Essence Hall served as host for the entire evening, returning between numbers to interact with the crowd and “activate” the time machine.
The queens were not on their own in delivering a show-stopping performance. Supported by an ensemble of six dancers as well as a myriad of lighting and visual effects, queens were able to deliver a high-budget package beyond the scale of even the “Drag Race” mainstage.
A few queens reached for the sky with their performances — suspended by aerial cables, season eight finalist Kim Chi flew above the stage dressed as a tea bag during a Boston-Tea-Party-themed number and season 14 winner Willow Pill rode a swing through a cloud of confetti.
Other standouts included Naomi Smalls’ sultry performance to a medley of FKA twigs songs in pirate garb, season 10 and 11 contestant Vanessa Vanjie Mateo’s lightning-fast choreography set in the Mayan Empire and season 11 winner Yvie Oddly’s wacky prehistoric performance.
Staying true to her “queen of the queerdos” title, Oddly began in a group of dancers all in frilly, bacterial garments before revealing her face dramatically, dancing in her signature gymnastic style and ending the number dressed as a prehistoric rat… dog… creature. Who cares about the taxonomy? Oddly sold it with her wild eyes and toothy grin.
The production stumbled toward the end of the first act, when a technical issue saw season 14 finalist Bosco introduced for a roaring ‘20s number, only for her music to be cut off seconds in. Essence Hall’s disembodied voice then introduced season 14 finalist Daya Betty, moving on from Bosco completely and leaving the audience confused.
Bosco did deliver her performance during the second act, but the awkward hiccup was never acknowledged. To make matters worse, Betty’s 1980s performance that followed the mishap fell flat, exhibiting none of the punk-rock edge that Betty was known for on the show. Instead, Betty opened lip syncing to “Don’t Stop Believing” by Journey, a song that’s charming at Thursday night dive-bar karaoke, but corny on a stage this extravagant.
The show also featured a “lip sync for your life” segment with audience participation, modeled after the show’s staple elimination challenge. Two audience members were invited onstage to each perform against season 14 finalist Lady Camden. Needless to say Camden is the one who shined, but every “Drag Race” fan fantasizes about facing off in a legendary lip sync, so watching two attendees participate added to the show’s friendly and lighthearted atmosphere.
The show was at its best in moments like this, when it was candid and authentic. Essence Hall was the clear standout of the night, more because of her endearing and playful emceeing than her two solo numbers. None of the other queens on the lineup were given a chance to speak to the crowd, tinging the show with an element of impersonality.
Therein lies a disappointing — if minor — crux of “Werq the World.” “Drag Race” fans come to see the queens they fell in love with on screen for not only their talent, but their personality.
I suppose it can’t be expected that a tour this grand, with this many stops, would stay completely fresh every night with every queen on 110%. But more interaction between the queens or a less repetitive structure that highlighted talents beyond lip syncing would have breathed more life into the show.
The show’s atmosphere was, unsurprisingly, much calmer and less intimate than typical drag performances in clubs and gay bars. Based on a visual survey, the audience seemed to trend older, and the energy in the auditorium was more similar to that of a theater production than a concert. The audience remained seated for the duration of the show, applauding for stunts and at the ends of numbers, but very few attendees were matching the queens’ energy.
The show reached its climax with one final number that brought all the queens back onstage in matching gold outfits. By showcasing the performers as one ensemble, this joyful finale celebrated the community aspect of drag artistry largely absent until this point in the night.
“Werq the World” ultimately delivered on its promise, offering something for “Drag Race” fans, not just drag fans. By spotlighting queens’ talents in an original, cohesive format and giving their fans an opportunity to witness their favorite queens in the flesh, “Werq the World” carries on “Drag Race’s” mission of spreading drag across the globe.

Living in Los Angeles without a car makes life a million times more difficult — day to day, socially and professionally. But the financial responsibility of a car is not feasible for low-income and out-of-state students, thus creating unequal opportunities in how students are able to “make the most” out of their college experience at USC.
Nobody walks in L.A. The Missing Persons said it in 1982, but it still remains true. On and around campus, students are able to rely on the University’s extremely popular Free Lyft program, (colloquially known as “Fryft”) to get around the USC area from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. (as long as it isn’t Game Day, when the program is delayed to five hours after kickoff). But for students who need transportation beyond these limited nighttime hours and outside of University Park, trying to figure out how to get from A to B can result in some major Ls.
The students and alumni who often complain about the USC bubble — that despite USC’s location in downtown L.A., students don’t get out and really explore the city — understand that the City of Angeles is so much more vast, diverse and cultured than just University Park, but with a lack of reliable transportation, many miss out on all that is beautiful about the city. 
Public transportation is a great resource to get around, but not in L.A. Unlike other major cities, the public transportation system in this city is inaccessible and oftentimes a deterrent for students wanting to explore outside of campus. The buses are inconsistent, and many students feel unsafe riding alone and/or at night. Rental cars are unavailable for students under 25 with few places adding on a fee for those that don’t meet the age requirement, and Zipcar, a popular and affordable car share program, only has a couple of locations near campus, making it difficult for students to utilize this service.
It comes down to a lack of independence, reliability and convenience. Having to depend on the Fryft program, public transportation and generous friends to get around greatly hinders how students are able to spend their time. What could be a 20-minute car ride turns into an hour-long bus ride, (that is, if the bus comes on time, or comes at all), or a five-minute car ride turns into a 45-minute walk. And, as busy college students, time is always a resource that needs to be spent extremely wisely in order to prioritize classes, homework, clubs and “adulting.” Figuring out time management is definitely a great struggle for many students and finding the will and free time to leave campus, especially without a car, just doesn’t make sense for many students who are booked and busy. With plenty to do on and around campus, why would they want to leave?
Staying solely in University Park might be fine for the unadventurous and the anxious, but with the freedom of college comes a great deal of personal discovery. Our school is in L.A., one of the most exciting places in the country. Every day, there are great movies and art exhibitions showing, fantastic comedians and musicians playing, flea markets brimming with exquisite finds, and a wealth of culture and opportunities — but students without a car are far less likely to be able to take advantage of these opportunities. 
Being without a car doesn’t just hinder freedom for recreational purposes but also practically and professionally. A study by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and UnidosUS stated, “Transportation is often the single thread holding together a precarious balancing act that allows the student to attend school while juggling multiple other responsibilities. Because transportation cuts across responsibilities related to work, school, and home, when that thread is broken, everything can unravel.”
For students in the School of Cinematic Arts or the Roski School of Art and Design, transporting big bulky canvases or 50-lb camera equipment generates stress and back pain for those without a car. Many internships say, point blank, not to apply if you don’t have a car. These companies want someone with reliable transportation, someone who is able to run errands and show up on time every day, but by excluding the car-less population they are actively participating in classism. Not to mention, cars are incredibly expensive, especially in L.A. where gas prices are criminal and parking is a privilege for those with spare time and money.
I’m not going to posit any solution or call to action, because the solution is better public transportation in L.A., a solution that would take many years, a lot of money and a capable and caring government — much more than one silly girl’s silly op-ed. This solution is one that the locals, commuters and working-class people of L.A. have been asking for for years and years, despite falling on deaf ears of an indifferent government. 
However, looking at the University, one can hope there is more they can do outside of a two-mile radius Fryft zone that does not even reach the edge of downtown L.A. with the large budget the University possesses. Let’s help students explore a bit further than the confines of USC gentrified hot spots. Whether that be with an increased number of Zipcars at a lower price, bus and metro passes for undergraduates or even expanding the Fryft zone to reach, at least, the Fashion District — every small change expands opportunities for students to explore L.A. I mean, how else are we to truly fulfill the University mission statement of “enriching our minds and spirit?”

As a queer Asian woman, I was excited at the prospect of taking classes that encompassed race and gender in college, especially at one as prestigious as USC. While I knew that it would be a predominantly white institution, I read of USC’s dedication to diversity and inclusion in the classroom and its alleged diverse faculty. But, many classes relating to race and gender had one thing in common — a white, cis-gendered and heterosexual man teaching it. 
To be honest, it’s not surprising — it’s expected. As Tsedale M. Melaku and Angie Beeman of the Harvard Business Review write, “Academia isn’t a safe haven for conversations about race and racism.” It’s just another white space where white male privilege is the norm and women of color become background noise. 
What makes it even more aggravating is that these white male professors don’t truly understand the intergenerational trauma and raw emotions that women of color experience and feel. Following sociologist Adia Harvey Wingfield’s concept of systemic gendered racism, professors in PWIs dominate conversations about race and gender through the dominant white male perspective which only perpetuates the racial inequality they attempt to discuss. To many students, it covertly sends a message of white male dominance, as the white man’s perspective becomes the only perspective. They control the narrative and render minority voices futile. 
In Beeman’s study on minorities’ experiences in academia, she wrote, “When discussions of systemic and institutional racism do happen, white people often want to run the conversation. In her forthcoming book, Beeman names this phenomenon ‘liberal white supremacy’ — the tendency of white people to constantly place themselves in the superior moral position.”
White professors’ understanding of culture, gender and discrimination come from books and lectures. They come from TED Talks. They come from another predominantly white institution. Not to discredit these sources, but hearing and being taught a white man’s interpretation of how he sees race and gender is not only frustrating but also outdated and invasive. Frankly, it feels condescending and like just another one of those eye-roll and side-eye inducing situations. 
It’s tiring to hear the constant, “Well as a white man, I will never know what it truly feels like…” or “Well, not to speak on anyone else’s experience, but personally…”  It just seems like the most my professors can do is acknowledge and move on. 
The issue is, most students in the class can’t just do that. Our gender and race is a lived-in experience. It’s an experience that didn’t just impact me — it impacted my mother, my grandmother and generations of women that have come before me. While my professor can lecture and call it a day, I, and many other students, are left sitting there, still living with their experiences. But despite these stark differences, the one who can leave his so-called “experiences” behind in the classroom is the one leading the lecture. 
This begs the question, why do predominantly white institutions like USC think a white man is, in any way, truly qualified to lecture on issues that they can never truly understand? Why do we always need the white man’s input? Are we truly that reliant on his voice? In these classes, Black and Indigenous women of color’s voices should be the center of the classroom conversation and focus. But is this even possible? The white man is in charge of your grade, how many points you get for discussing; he’s the one that decides whether you pass or fail — the one that can test you on these issues.
I’m not saying white men’s voices don’t hold value. Neither am I starting a hate bandwagon on white male professors. While we can all recognize that we have a much greater diverse faculty, it’s ironic and frustrating that the white cis-gendered heterosexual man is always the center of healing and connecting conversations on issues they perpetuate and create. The problem at hand isn’t the white man themselves, but rather their entitlement and ignorance.
So the next time I walk into my class, I’ll be looking towards the white man once again, teaching me about my own experiences. Ironic, isn’t it? H.P. Lovecraft wasn’t joking when he said, “From even the greatest of horrors, irony is seldom absent.”

Netflix recently released a documentary titled “The Figo Affair: The Transfer That Changed Football,” which follows legendary professional football player Luis Figo’s controversial £37.2 million transfer from Catalan outfit FC Barcelona to bitter rivals Real Madrid CF in the summer of 2000. The mesmerizing fusion of never-before-seen footage and revealing talking head interviews immerses the viewers in one of the most poignant moments in professional soccer history. 
Subsequently, Figo’s scalding departure demoralized FC Barcelona and preceded four excruciating trophyless seasons. Real Madrid’s club president, Florentino Pérez, continued his lavish spending and engineered the infamous “Galactico” era, where the likes of talented players such as Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo Nazário and David Beckham donned the jersey. Pérez’s extravagant acquisitions completely altered the international soccer market and encouraged the exorbitant transfer fees apparent today (but that is a topic better saved for another day).
As an avid soccer fan, I have always followed different national leagues throughout Europe. I only passively support Real Madrid precisely because of their famed “Galactico” era and tune into their games when it’s either in the Champions League or during El Clásico. However, after watching the documentary and reading into the rivalry’s creation and origins, I began questioning my perception of both clubs and wanted to determine what made this derby particularly special. 
History of Betrayal
Figo’s controversial transfer from Barcelona to Real Madrid only adds to the countless transactions between the two club giants. One of Real Madrid’s famed Galactico players, Ronaldo Nazário, spent a season in Barcelona and experienced an injury-riddled spell at Inter Milan before eventually signing for Real Madrid in 2002. To be fair, Ronaldo eventually severed ties with Inter Milan after signing for direct city rivals, AC Milan, in 2007. Legendary Cameroonian player, Samuel Eto’o enjoyed five fruitful seasons at Barcelona despite representing Real Madrid when he was 16. 
However, due to Spain’s history as a country, endearing Barcelona figures who decide to move to Real Madrid dishearten Catalonians. “The Figo Affair” briefly mentioned the established feud between not only the two Spanish clubs but also between Barcelona and Real Madrid. Figo’s transfer exacerbated long-standing animosities originating from political and economic differences. 
Repression Under Francoist Spain 
Francisco Franco’s victory in the Spanish Civil War during the 1930s signaled extensive changes in Spain’s bureaucracy and bestowed Catalan repression. Perverse Spanish nationalism targetted the Catalan language, expression and regional autonomy. Consequently, Barcelona and its football grounds represented a refuge for Catalans evading language censorship and oppression from Spanish authorities. The newly formed government effectively controlled club operations and ostracized any resistance.     
Sports historians argue back and forth regarding Franco’s influence on Spain’s domestic soccer competitions and seemingly biased support towards Real Madrid, the sport beacon emblematic of the country’s capital. Regardless, Barcelona fell victim to Franco’s dictatorial regime and suffered culturally in the decades following the Civil War. 
Tale of Two Cities 
Politically, Catalonia continues its effort to attain independence from Spain. Shortly after Spain transitioned from Franco’s regime, Catalonia utilized its newly acquired liberty toward referendums, but Spain’s unified sovereignty in its 1978 constitution constricted Catalan efforts. Catalonia’s attempted referendum in 2017 ultimately fell in the final hurdle due to Spain determining efforts were illegal, which led to authority crackdown on ballot papers and polling stations. Barcelona’s motto, “Més que un club,” roughly translates to “More than a club,” as Catalan’s historical bouts for sovereignty remain intrinsic to the club’s values. 
Conversely, Madrid’s status as Spain’s capital helped galvanize and accelerate their ascendence to football in its beginning years. Madrid figures created the first professional Spanish football tournament, known as the Copa del Rey, as a tribute to King Alfonso XIII. Additionally, despite companies’ interest in forming other football federations and a separate club union, Real Madrid received backing from King Alfonso XIII, which consequently dismantled other organizations. 
Pinnacle of Football
El Clásico remains one of the most mainstream football rivalries due to the competitive profiles of both clubs, which are sporting giants domestically and internationally. Barcelona has won five total Champions League titles, four of which came in the last two decades, and they have won the Spanish League Championship a staggering 26 times. However, Real Madrid has won the European Cup 14 times and has been the domestic champions a mind-boggling 35 times. 
Regardless of the controversial history between the two clubs, El Clásico will continue presenting refined football performances and will continue to be the pinnacle of professional football.

For many years, USC was at the center of a slew of scandals that threw the University into the national spotlight and exposed deep-seated issues within the school administration and culture. In July, Pulitzer Prize-winning Los Angeles Times investigative journalist Paul Pringle released a personal account of the L.A. Times investigations that brought several of these scandals, including the wrongdoings of Carmen Puliafito, former dean of Keck School of Medicine, and former USC gynecologist Dr. George Tyndall, to light.
In his new book, “Bad City: Power and Peril in the City of Angels,” Pringle describes the obstacles he faced — including from his own newsroom editors — and reflects on power and accountability at major institutions, including the Times and USC. 
In 2017, the Times spurred headlines around the world with a report uncovering the double life of Puliafito, who resigned the year before. The Times’ report revealed Puliafito partied and took illegal drugs with “addicts and prostitutes,” sometimes in his on-campus office. The report noted Puliafito was respected for his fundraising abilities. During his almost 10 years at USC, he raised more than one billion dollars in donations for Keck and oversaw the school’s seven-spot rise in the U.S. News & World Report medical school rankings. 
Following the initial report, stories from the Times continued to expose the extent and consequences of Puliafito’s misconduct. The Medical Board of California revoked Puliafito’s license in July 2018, recognizing Puliafito’s “appalling lack of judgment.”
In “Bad City,” Pringle shares the story of Devon Khan, whose tip started Pringle’s investigation into Puliafito. In 2016, Khan, then a Pasadena hotel manager, sought medical aid for Puliafito’s young companion, Sarah Warren, after she overdosed in a room the two were sharing. “Bad City” also delves further into Warren and her family’s story. Puliafito often delivered drugs to Warren while she was in Orange County drug treatment programs, and the book’s end reveals that her brother continues to struggle with addiction to the drugs and heavy drinking Puliafito introduced him to. 
Pringle details why the first news story on Puliafito took more than a year to break, alleging that his former editors, Marc Duvoisin and Davan Maharaj, took lengths to impede his reporting, including spending weeks making superfluous edits, discouraging him from speaking to then-University president Dr. C.L. Max Nikias and withholding the story when it was almost complete. 
In the book, Pringle shares suspicions that his editors were influenced by the University’s power and prestige. Conditions got so dire, Pringle recalls, that he and some trusted colleagues, including two Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism alumni, formed a small undercover team to continue the reporting. 
“It was very courageous of my colleagues to help me on the story after the initial [story] was killed,” Pringle said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “They didn’t have to do that. They did it because they’re good journalists. They were determined to do the right thing and to get this information out there, and they succeeded with that. And I’m very grateful for that.”
Pringle also recounts coming up against a “wall of silence” from the University. He received no response the several times he reached out to the Nikias administration about Puliafito, and after one attempted in-person visit, the administration allegedly sent a complaint to Pringle’s editors without Pringle’s knowledge.
After exposing Puliafito’s misconduct, the Times and Pringle went on in 2018 to report on decades of alleged sexual abuse by a former campus gynecologist. Tyndall was accused of frequently touching his patients inappropriately during pelvic exams at the Engemann Student Health Center, where he worked for nearly 30 years. He seemingly targeted students of Chinese descent in later years. 
Following the Times’ report on Tyndall, hundreds of former and current female students who had been treated by Tyndall came forward with similar allegations — more than 800 lawsuits alleging the University covered up and downplayed Tyndall’s actions were filed. In March 2021, the University reached an $852 million settlement with 710 women who filed cases, bringing the total payout to Tyndall’s victims to $1.1 billion. 
The Puliafito and Tyndall investigations were not the first Pringle had conducted involving the University. Pringle was also part of the Times team that reported on bribes at the L.A. Memorial Coliseum and the following ,dealings between the stadium and University. In “Bad City,” Pringle discusses the troubling culture of silence he saw at the University. During the Coliseum investigation, Pringle recalls experiencing little transparency from the Nikias administration; and from his interactions with an insider source during the time, Pringle concludes employees were reluctant “about publicly knocking the school’s administrators.”
In both the Puliafito and Tyndall cases, complaints were made for years about their behavior, but had been largely ignored or mishandled. The University received complaints about Puliafito before his resignation, but did not take action beyond issuing disciplinary measures and coaching. Complaints about Tyndall stretched back to the 1990s, but he was only suspended in 2016, after nurse Cindy Gilbert reached out to the campus rape crisis center. 
“People were hurt,” Pringle said. “Bad things were done, and the institutions responsible for both preventing that or at least correcting it did not do their jobs. That includes USC, that includes the Pasadena Police Department, in my view, the District Attorney’s Office [and] the State Attorney General’s Office. They let these people down in both cases, and it finally took a newspaper to get at least some justice for these people who were denied by these institutions.”
In “Bad City,” Pringle credits the individuals who spoke up and helped move the Puliafito and Tyndall stories forward at the risk of personal consequences and reprisals. The story he tells is full of these “truth tellers,” such as Khan, the Warren family and Gilbert.
“The whistleblowers — this book memorializes their courage,” Pringle said. “They put everything on the line just to do the right thing.”
Although it took some convincing from his literary agent for him to agree to write the book, Pringle said he eventually welcomed the opportunity it presented.  
“[In a book], you have the length, the freedom, to tell the complete story and especially with the people involved, the Warren family [and] the whistleblowers like Devon Khan,” Pringle said. “Their stories were not told, what happened inside the newsroom wasn’t told and the experiences that the reporters themselves went through.”
Annenberg professor of communication Robert Scheer said he saw the book as a “teaching moment” for his “Contours of Change and Ethics in Media and Communication” class. He assigned one class the entire book and the other a New York Times review of it. 
Scheer said he believes the book highlights, among other lessons, the importance of press freedom. Scheer has worked as a journalist for more than 30 years — including time spent working for the L.A. Times — and has taught at the University for more than 20 years. 
“I have a lot of affection about USC, and I think we have great students and we have a strong faculty,” Scheer said. “But we have been at the center of horrible scandals and betrayals of trust. The book hits a number of them, quite accurately. The reporters who worked on the story, including the author of the book, deserve a lot of credit. This is a reminder of the importance of local journalism.”
Maximilian Brichta, a teaching assistant for Scheer’s “Contours of Change and Ethics in Media and Communications” class, said he was familiar with Puliafito and Tyndall before the book was published, but said the class discussion developed his understanding of the scandals’ enabling factors.
“You got to ask, ‘[Are] these different departments responsible for it?’” Brichta said. “You do not know what knowledge was known to people outside of these departments, particularly up the chain of command, all the way up to, at the time, President Nikias. Without knowing that, it’s hard to say how much of this is a USC-wide cultural, systemic issue. I’m unsure of the facts there, and I think a lot of folks aren’t sure of the facts there because there has been a lack of transparency of who knows what, when.”
Brichta said the discussion based on the book also prompted him to think more critically about the University administration and the effectiveness of guards against corruption and unethical behavior. He specifically mentioned the investigation the University launched into Puliafito following the Times’ report, which was led by a former U.S. attorney, Debra Wong Yang, whose ties to the University were questioned in “Bad City.” The investigation was never made public. 
“USC is a private institution,” Brichta said. “It makes me question how well suited this self-contained system in keeping a check of power on itself, when there seems to be a conflict of interest baked into the very investigation of its own faculty.”
Brichta said he believes the University administration is still lacking in transparency and urgency when it comes to issues pertinent to the USC community, citing the University’s delayed response to drug-spiking allegations at fraternities last October as another recent case. 
Considering Puliafito and Tyndall’s wrongdoings were allowed to continue for so long, Brichta said he believes trust will be hard for the University to restore. However, as years pass and students cycle through the University, Brichta said he does worry that these events and the issues they raise may be forgotten too soon. 
“The University has historically made it seem like there’s nothing to see here,” Brichta said. “To me, a matter of a few years can’t restore that trust in the public imagination for anybody who’s actually paying attention to this. But again, I came in 2019 at the heels of all this. When you have a turnover rate that’s baked into the system, like [in] universities, it’s easy to forget. It’s easy to say that we’re starting from a clean slate.”
For the Record: Since the book was published and the Daily Trojan story was written, disputes have arisen regarding the accuracy of how internal processes at the Los Angeles Times are represented by the author.
