The meteoric rise of electronic music over the past few years has not phased New York-based indie-rock band Tribe Society. Instead of rejecting the trend entirely, electronic kick drums and bass lines have become the backbone of Tribe Society’s new music.
Lead vocalist Gavin McDevitt and synth player and flutist Seth Hachen explain that online music streaming services have been an influential element of the group’s success. After posting its reimagination of Young Thug’s “Stoner,” the group gained popularity, and their subscribers and followers have grown into tens of thousands.
“It’s so amazing to be an artist in this time period with SoundCloud, Spotify and YouTube. You’re not just playing a little show in your hometown anymore — you’re going worldwide,” Hachen said about their rise to fame. “And music is the universal language. Sometimes we’ll be looking on Spotify to see where our music is getting played and we’ll see Paris as the location. It’s so cool … You’re able to reach more people that could be vibing with you.”
Another reimagination by the group that has gained recognition is their cover of “Here Comes the Sun” by The Beatles. Its most popular song at the moment is “Kings,” which has nearly three million plays on Spotify and is growing by the day. Tribe Society’s first album was released in June 2015, and just last week, the group dropped a music video for the single “Secrets” off their newest album, We Sell Drugs.
Instrumental and vocal juxtaposition occupies a major presence in Tribe Society’s newest work. The first track on the album that will be released on March 3 is called “New Vibe.” It is the lightest in their series of releases — a heavenly combination of ethereal falsetto vocals, acoustic guitar and geometric kick drums, which add depth and dimension to the tune. The album then dives into darker, more sinister sounds for the remaining tracks.
Contrary to other bands, Tribe Society is not shy about its political posts and marijuana references on social media and in their music videos — although Hatchen and McDevitt  hardly consider themselves to be political. After they toured across the country this past summer, they gained a different perspective on politics.
“We unite people more than we divide people. And when you come to our shows, you’ll see people from all walks of life, from both sides of the political spectrum,” McDevitt said.
Ultimately, Tribe Society believes in inherent goodness within individuals and understands that people want what is best for themselves and their families.
Some artists that Hatchen and McDevitt credit as major influencers in their music tastes are Wu-Tang Clan, Beck, Radiohead and Smashing Pumpkins. Some elements of these artists are very evident in their music. For example, one song in particular off the new album has a strong vintage Beck influence as far as song structure and vocal style.
Tribe Society has worked alongside other artists signed by Island Records, its recording label; artists such as Kiesza have added to the group’s list of high profile collaborations. The band hopes to work with more established names as well as up-and-coming artists to further diversify and advance its discography.
Update: A previous photo caption of this article identified the lead singer of Tribe Society as “Gavin Merlot.” His name is actually Gavin McDevitt. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Elizabeth Gu | Daily Trojan
I visited Beijing with my family when I was 12. My parents are from Taipei, but the mainland is where my ancestors lived. Unlike the democratic Taipei, which my sister and I had become familiar with after multiple trips, Beijing was expansive and smoggy and unfamiliar to me. Police stopped a woman on the street just to search her bag. The computer in our hotel lobby would not allow access to Facebook.
But what struck me most about our visit to Beijing was how Chinese tourists treated foreigners or at least, the visibly foreign: an English family at the Forbidden City, a group of white Americans at the Great Wall. Other visitors, all Chinese, seemed to flock over them: The tourists were exotic and enticing, and some even asked for pictures with them.
Of course, my sister and I were foreign, too; we were raised in the Midwest, with accents weaving through our Mandarin as thick as blood. And yet, no one asked to take pictures with us. No one thought to look our way.
Asian culture is obsessed with white beauty, but even more pervasive than that is the desire for appreciation from white Westerners. Colorism is deeply embedded within Asian cultures; it is apparent in the number of skin-lightening creams lining drugstore shelves and the inane fear that consuming too much soy sauce will make your skin grow dark. Lighter is beautiful. White is the jackpot.
At 12 years old, I didn’t need to be told this. I was growing up round-faced and Asian American in a predominantly conservative neighborhood in Cincinnati. My high school just didn’t have any kids who looked like me. It seemed like the girls who earned boyfriends all had flat stomachs and big eyes and light-colored hair. I specifically remember growing up, at four or five or six, thinking that one day I would be able to stroke my own blonde hair, falling in waves around my shoulders.
At the time, I could imagine no other standard to hold myself to.
No matter how far I’ve traveled, it seemed like this iron tenet would not break: Things are better when white people do them. It’s why China rose up in a frenzy after President Donald Trump’s granddaughter sang a song in Mandarin. It’s why the upcoming movie The Great Wall, starring Matt Damon and set in ancient China, is reviled for whitewashing in the United States and celebrated on the other side of the globe.
When you’re Chinese, it feels affirming to see a blockbuster set in your country starring a white lead. But when you’re Chinese American, it gets complicated.
Of course, this Chinese American girl grew up writing furiously and watching movies hungrily, and she moved out to Los Angeles to pursue her dreams through film school. The scripts I write today are about women and people of color, and I carry the fullest belief that expanding our scope of who belongs in the movies only broadens the possibilities of our art. By nature of my own identity, I have strong opinions about The Great Wall and Damon — who seems blissfully ignorant of how diversity and progress works in filmmaking. But not all of these I can reconcile with the activist values that guide my every day.
The Great Wall was created for two global audiences, and because of that, it was a genius move. Chinese actress Jing Tian stars next to Damon, and audiences everywhere delight. Right?
There are so many things to parse, the obvious one being that a story set in ancient China does not need to star a white dude. Damon is not whitewashing a character in the traditional sense — as in, playing a role that was originally written for an Asian, a la Tilda Swinton — but it’s still giving the reins of a fantastical, Chinese story to a white Westerner.
And yet in some way, China’s enthusiastic response to Damon’s casting reminds me of being 12 and wanting white approval. It reminds me of thinking that a body with Eurocentric features would make me more valuable and loveable, and in that sense I reluctantly understand.
Put a white face on the poster for a movie starring a Chinese actress, by a Chinese director, and it becomes a vehicle for success and attention. One thing’s for sure: Identity is integral to the movies, and it runs deep.

In a scene that will put all first dates to shame for centuries to come, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone prance through Griffith Observatory in the middle of the night and launch into the air for an extended song and dance number.
Not only do they break into the planetarium, but they also twirl through the stars for an entire evening, and all of that is perfectly believable. After all, it’s the musical La La Land. However, director Damien Chazelle forgot to fill one glaring, gaping plot hole in the film: Where did Sebastian and Mia go to eat after their musical shenanigans?
The answer may be The Trails, a small food kiosk nestled in Griffith Park, just a mile walk away from the Observatory at 2333 Fern Dell Drive. Serving coffee, baked goods and a limited selection of sandwiches and entrees, this quaint cafe is perfect for fueling a day hike through the park or a night of illegal, gravity-defying musical theater.
With decor that can only be described as “shack chic” and a clumsy chalkboard menu, the restaurant doesn’t look especially incredible at first glance. If it wasn’t for the bright yellow sign and long line sloping toward the street, it would be easy to drive past and miss it. However, as the large crowd gathered in front of the kiosk suggests, this is worth waiting for.
The menu straddles a strange line between cozy bakeshop fare — scones, muffins and cookies — and utilitarian lunchbox favorites — egg salad sandwiches, grilled cheese sandwiches, hearty quiches and pastry-wrapped hot dogs. The drink menu is extensive, with a full selection of espresso drinks from Stumptown Coffee Roasters, a characteristically bold, small-batch Portland roaster, as well as fresh-squeezed lemonade and Jarritos sodas.
Though it caters to vegetarians, the cafe does not serve a light, diet-friendly lunch: This is stick-to-your-ribs adventure food, suited for a hike through the park or a romp through the observatory.
Special standouts on the menu include the avocado sandwich, with a generous serving of avocado paired with tomatoes, red onions, soy bacon bits (because vegetarians deserve bacon, too), alfalfa sprouts, cheddar cheese and mayo, all piled onto a sweet, hearty wheat bread. It’s a solid amount of food for the $8.50 price tag, and though the bread was a bit dry, the thick layer of avocado more than made up for it.
The quiche was another dish to note, and though the menu seemed slightly threatening when it instructed customers to “ask what I’m made of,” the daily special of artichoke, tomato and parmesan produced a rich and savory egg filling in a light crust.
Highly differentiated from the sterile açai bowls and delicate microgreen salads that have invaded L.A.’s culinary scene in recent years, cheese and butter flow freely at The Trails, creating a cozy homemade atmosphere. The all-outdoor seating, cement picnic tables and milling crowds of families and dogs add to the chaotic, inviting environment, making the dining area feel like one giant, disorganized family reunion.
For dessert, the honey lavender shortbread cookie pairs well with their house-made almond milk latte, and though the famous pies had sold out by midday, they are supposed to be phenomenal as well.
Whether fueling up for a day hike in Griffith Park or a midnight re-creation of everyone’s favorite La La Land sequence, it’s hard to go wrong with The Trails.

USC is hosting the College Talent Tour for the third time since its inception this semester, giving aspiring singers the opportunity to compete against each other in front of judges and students to prove they have what it takes to win.
The College Talent Tour is a unique singing competition spaced out over three months. It gives students of all experience levels the opportunity to hone their skills through a modern audition process, regular meetings with coaches and an eventual live competition showcasing the top four contestants.
The winner of USC’s installment in December was Sarah Linick, a sophomore majoring in communication, whose soulful piano rendition of Kanye West’s “Only One” not only earned her the title, but also proved that anyone with talent can win.
“Former contestants include accomplished engineers, scholar athletes and world humanitarians. College Talent tour is open to anyone that sings,” said Mario Jose, an organizer of the show,
General auditions closed on Sunday after contestants sent in a recording of themselves singing a two-minute song of their choice. On Feb. 18, auditions will be held for the top 16, which will be narrowed down to four contestants that will advance to the three coaching sessions on Feb. 25, March 4 and April 14.  The coaching sessions are formatted like boot camps to provide rigorous training for the artists before they take the stage for the final round.
The College Talent Tour will last through most of the semester, with the final live show airing on April 15. This year, the winner will win a $1,000 prize, and the runner-up will receive recognition on the show’s website.
In 2014, the College Talent Tour kicked off its inaugural run at UC Berkeley, which allowed college students with all levels of experience a chance to compete for the top prize. It ultimately expanded to USC in 2015 and to colleges such as New York University, University of Pennsylvania and UCLA the following year.
Similar to most singing competitions, the College Talent Tour invites celebrity judges to give contestants opinions from professionals in the music industry. These judges have included Christina Grimmie and Chris Jamison in the past. The show also exposes contestants to other icons in the music industry who could help them grow as professional artists.
“It’s hard to pick one aspect of the show that’s my favorite,” said celebrity guest Drake Bell in a video featured on the tour’s website. “You know, it was like being on American Idol or something.”
The College Talent Tour also includes opportunities for participants to create music videos and perform at iconic venues in the city of the host campus. The final live show will be filmed for the pilot episode of a television show.
“You should audition for College Talent Tour if you have any inkling that you want to pursue music — even if it’s at 1 percent, you should give it a shot because I did, and I couldn’t be happier,” said Grace Korkunis, a former contestant from USC in a video posted to the show’s website.
The College Talent Tour at USC is currently taking place and will continue until April 15.

With his recent executive order aimed at defunding “sanctuary jurisdictions,” President Donald Trump did what he does best — threatening his opponents. While this threat is definitely a concern that USC should consider while weighing the idea of becoming a sanctuary campus, the University shouldn’t allow it to stand in the way of protecting its students and supporting other sanctuary jurisdictions.
USC is one of the nation’s most diverse campuses, located in Los Angeles — a sanctuary city in the state of California, currently considering status as a sanctuary state. As the city of Los Angeles, the state of California and countless other jurisdictions across the United States are standing up to Trump’s threats, USC should continue to support these jurisdictions by enforcing similar sanctuary policies. Refusing to do so due to the threat of defunding gives credibility to these very threats, which other jurisdictions are taking with a grain of salt.
Granted, the amount of federal funding that USC relies on — $443 million for research — is nothing to laugh at. However, in addition to the nearly 40 cities and counties with sanctuary status in California, many college campuses have declared sanctuary status. These campuses, like the entire California State University system, are public institutions and therefore face an even greater threat of funding cuts, but still opted for sanctuary status. The California State University system adopted sanctuary-like policies — although they did not name themselves sanctuary campuses — following the November election.
Of course, “everyone else is doing it” seems like a silly argument, but it would be even more silly to preemptively recoil from sanctuary policies in fear of defunding, while other jurisdictions are standing strong. Additionally, there is strong campus support for our status as a sanctuary campus, as evidenced by USC’s Undergraduate Student Government senators’ passage of a November resolution in favor of designating the university a sanctuary campus. All but one senator voted yes.
Also in November, USC Provost Michael Quick released a statement affirming the University’s commitment to protecting students, writing, “Our Department of Public Safety follows the lead of the Los Angeles Police Department, which does not initiate law enforcement activities based solely on immigration status.”
This was the right tone for the University to take — following the lead of the city we exist in. If Los Angeles decides to back off from its sanctuary status because it decides Trump’s threat could seriously result in the city’s defunding, then and only then should USC also retreat. Until then, it wouldn’t make sense to be an island without sanctuary in the middle of one of the nation’s of sanctuary cities.
Furthermore, as Quick also noted in his statement, providing authorities information about students’ immigration status could be in violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, under which USC cannot give out information from student records without student consent or a judicial order. Students deserve their right to privacy, and students at our University should be able to study without being in fear of the very university they trusted with their information to give it up to federal authorities. This puts universities stuck between a rock and a hard place — they can either violate FERPA or violate President Trump’s executive order.
This is at least partially due to the general uncertainty regarding what qualifies a sanctuary jurisdiction, since many institutions such as USC have sanctuary policies without explicitly declaring themselves “sanctuary campuses.”
Finally, the exact definition of a “sanctuary jurisdiction” is unclear and varies between jurisdictions. Will jurisdictions be defunded as soon as they merely request immunity for immigrant constituents?
It is unclear whether, or how, Trump will enforce his threat of stripping sanctuary states, cities, counties and other locales across the United States of funding. Until this is clear, sanctuary jurisdictions should not back down from their stance.
USC should stand with California cities, counties and other educational institutions as a sanctuary campus, presenting a united front that protects students. Once they start to take Trump’s threat seriously, USC can also consider shedding its sanctuary status.

Sadly, Trump’s contentious issue is yet one more that makes being an international student difficult, on top of our already complex culture and language. Assimilation assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on life’s journey. Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow students, and even informative books to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.
   One such new award-winning worldwide book/ebook that reaches out to help anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they’ve contributed to our society, including students.    
   A chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture, friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work with/for an American firm here or overseas. 
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here. 
   Good luck to all wherever you study or wherever you come from, because that is the TRUE spirit of the American PEOPLE, not a few in government who have the loudest voice!

Though Los Angeles and USC have expressed their noble intention to resist federal policies aimed at deporting or detaining undocumented persons, doing so may create more problems than it would solve. This week, the Los Angeles Times reported that the federal government spends nearly $5 billion on California public universities each year. An additional sum of nearly $500 million goes annually to L.A. city programs like port security. Of critical importance to the Trojan community, USC received about $421 million from the federal government for research in 2015. All of these funds may be in jeopardy if proponents of the sanctuary movement actively combat the commands of the federal government. Even more concerning, though, is that obstructing the federal government’s lawful actions tears at the fabric of our constitutional republic.
Rachel Atherly | Daily Trojan
First, it cannot be stated enough that undocumented individuals are human beings. They have undeniable human rights and their dignity must be protected. However, the United States is also a sovereign country that has the right to determine its immigration policy. We now have a president who apparently wants to make the country more isolated and xenophobic. We can debate the propriety of that day and night, but what we cannot deny is the facial legality of immigration programs aimed at removing illegal immigrants from the United States.
The supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution establishes that the laws and decisions made by the federal government constitute the supreme law of the land. History shows that blatant resistance to lawful federal acts carries grave consequences. This is what is at stake in the debate over sanctuary cities and campuses and their place in California in the Trump era. In short — like paying taxes — we may not like it, but we have to comply with unsavory acts if they are constitutional.
One such unsavory act is an immigration program from 2008 which was restarted by President Donald Trump last month. Known as “Secure Communities,” the program was initiated by President George W. Bush’s administration. The goal of “Secure Communities” was to share information and coordinate the actions of federal, state and local law enforcement personnel with regard to immigration control. In other words, local and state peace officers would be expected to work with federal authorities to apprehend, identify and deport undocumented individuals who had committed crimes. The program was canceled in 2014 under President Barack Obama.
While there has been controversy over the constitutionality of the program’s implementation, “Secure Communities” has never been deemed unconstitutional as a whole. Furthermore, Immigration and Customs Enforcement made it clear that “state and local jurisdictions cannot opt out of Secure Communities.” This effectively created a nationwide requirement to share the immigration information and biometrics of arrested persons suspected of being in the United States illegally with federal authorities. All of this means that law enforcement authorities throughout the state once again have an obligation to report information about suspected illegal immigrants to the federal government. This is in addition to the universal obligation to comply with legally issued warrants. If those apparently constitutional obligations are not respected, the resisting party can be charged with the federal crime of obstruction.
The federal government must always act in accordance with the Constitution, and where the government does not, it must be corrected. However, until the president’s decisions on immigration or withholding funding are deemed unconstitutional, they are expected to be followed.
Across the country, cities like Los Angeles and several college campuses have pledged to protect undocumented members of their communities. This is laudable in the current political climate. However, what must be understood is that this promise is likely all bark and no bite — and if it does bite, then it bites the hand that feeds. We cannot afford that.

On Jan. 28, Uber decided to disable surge pricing around New York’s John F. Kennedy airport in response to widespread airport protests and a taxi driver strike inspired by President Donald Trump’s travel ban. This was a fairly common practice for the company, which routinely lowers prices around emergency situations to avoid being seen as profiting from disaster. On top of this, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick’s involvement on Trump’s economic advisory column in itself spurred calls to delete the app. To many, Kalanick’s decision to align himself with Trump sent the message that his company condoned the presidential administration’s penchant for bigotry.
In response,  the #DeleteUber hashtag almost immediately began to surge through Facebook and Twitter, and by the end of the week, a reported 200,000 Uber users deleted their accounts on the ride sharing service in response to the controversy. Protesters also voiced their disapproval for Kalanick’s participation in a Trump economic advisory council, and on Thursday, Kalanick responded by publicly resigning from the council.
Surely, at least a few of those deleted accounts were USC students who rely on the school’s partnership with the company, established in 2015, for free late night transportation. Thumbs may have hovered over the “USC Uber” option within the app as students weighed whether this company was worth supporting, and as the hatred for Uber grew over the course of the week, the subject of severing ties with the company must have come up in administrative meetings.
Uber desperately asserted its position against the travel ban for the rest of the week, saying that it was “unjust, wrong, and against everything we stand for as a company” in an email to deleters. But the damage was done, and this incident only added to the growing list of shady business practices from the company, which also include downplaying sexual assault claims, accepting money from foreign governments and spying on customers.
The #DeleteUber movement was an example of consumer literacy on a nationwide scale, and though it may have gone too far, it highlighted the lengths that people are willing to go when a company does something that does not mesh with their personal ideologies. But after the massive response to this small action by a company that already had a less-than-stellar reputation, there seems to be some gaps in consumer logic.
For example, if USC was pressured to stop the USC Uber program, should they also be pressured to stop offering discounted Disneyland tickets or serving Pepsi products, after both company’s CEOs participated in the same advisory committee that Kalanick resigned from? Should the school switch to Lyft, another ride sharing service, even though it received a $100 million investment from noted Trump supporter and advisor Carl Icahn in 2015? Examining the political ties of favorite companies feels almost futile in the era of Trump, who seems to have ties to every major corporation in the United States, but that doesn’t negate the importance of consumer literacy.
Even though the most visible reaction to Uber’s decision was the #deleteuber hashtag, the one that may have more lasting impact was the extended boycotts by groups like “Grab Your Wallet,” which emphasize the importance of showing political views by supporting companies that align with personal beliefs, as difficult as that may be. The #DeleteUber movement showed us that the widespread actions of individuals can and will change the policies of even the most corrupt companies, and though the actions may have been misplaced, they were a powerful example of consumer power.
Remember the #deleteuber movement, and the power that you wield as a customer and consumer. The current political climate makes it easy to feel helpless, but remember that small actions like deleting an account or voicing an opinion matter deeply in the long run. Do not fall into social media mob mentality, and don’t expect companies to be perfect — they are in pursuit of money, after all. But do not forget the power of the wallet and informed choices.

Redshirt junior kicker Matt Boermeester has been indefinitely suspended from the USC football team, as the University investigates him for a student code of conduct issue.
“The University is investigating a code of conduct issue with Matt Boermeester,” a USC spokesperson said in a statement. “Student disciplinary records and proceedings regarding any matter of student conduct are confidential and protected by law.
“While this student code of conduct issue is being investigated, the student will not be representing the University as a member of its athletic team.”
It was first reported by the sports website Deadspin.
Before beginning his football career at USC, Boermeester was a freshman placekicker at Saddleback Junior College in Mission Viejo, Calif. Boermeester kicked the game-winning field goal as time expired to win the Rose Bowl Game for USC in January.
USC has dismissed three football players over the past year for student conduct issues: Osa Masina, Don Hill and Jabari Ruffin. Masina, a linebacker, was removed from the University following one charge of rape and two counts of forcible sodomy. Hill was removed from the program in connection to Masina’s case. Ruffin was suspended indefinitely for a student conduct issue in October, one month after he was suspended for half a game for stomping on an opponent’s groin.

Dear (Hopefully) Young Reader, 
First, please go register to vote in your state if you haven’t yet. Beyond the USG elections, please vote for issues that directly affect your hometown, home state, federal government, etc. Political apathy does not sit pretty. 
Now, back to the question at hand — USG Elections. I’m going to tackle this question in two parts: why these positions are important and my experience with USG. Head to the part that interests you the most (if you value my opinion at all). 
P.S.- My friend told me I use a lot of parentheses. (It’s a personality thing, OK?)
WHY THESE POSITIONS ARE IMPORTANT
I’ll keep my opinion concentrated within the roles of the USG President and Vice President (because apparently, that’s a hot topic on campus right now). Your USG President and Vice President (if they’re qualified) voice your issues to the university president and provost. They work with administrators to help USG accomplish its goals. They sit on the Budget Allocations Committee, which distributes the student programming fee to very key organizations on campus. However, most importantly, your USG President and Vice President lead an organization of over 100 student leaders across five distinct branches: programming, legislative, advocacy, communications and funding (judicial remains separate for good reason). The student leaders of these branches do invaluable work on this campus. I’ve seen it firsthand and I’ve been a part of it. Having a USG President and Vice President who can stand up for what they believe in, support them, and guide them is so important. 
MY EXPERIENCE WITH USG
I’ve spent three years on campus involved in USG. Let me tell you about the learning curve. It takes a semester to learn how the organization works and how you can leave your impact. It takes another semester to truly make an impact and it takes two years after that to continue fighting and to figure out how you want to improve USG. 
I’m an executive officer currently (Finance & Adminstration Director of Program Board) and let me tell you, I pour my heart and soul into this organization, and I still feel like I’m underperforming. For those who want numbers, I’m supposed to spend 16 hours per week in USG for my office hours. Last semester and this semester, I purposely did not sign up for Friday office hours. To my memory, there have only been three Fridays that I was not in the office in the last 19 weeks. I spend a lot of time outside of the office attending Program Board’s events and meetings. Ask my apartment mates, I’m rarely ever home. I spend a gross amount of time outside of my office hours working on the things I need to get done. For example, I’ve spent an absurdly weird and long amount of time in restructuring this organization (which isn’t in my job description but hey, I’m passionate) because I want to leave it for the better. I’m passionate about this organization because there’s so much that can be done within this organization. That’s why I do work beyond my office hours, beyond my job description. I’m not trying to brag about how much I work because honestly, I haven’t been able to accomplish every single thing I’ve wanted to do (and I think the hours I put into this job is slightly unhealthy and I feel like I’m doing senior year wrong). But, I’m highlighting this because so many officers in USG go beyond what they are asked to do. You need leaders who can support these people, who can push these people to challenge themselves and the administration, and most importantly, leaders who truly want to do this. People who will work with people until 2 a.m. to better the university. In three years time, I’ve seen my fair share of people walk through TCC 224 (the USG office), do their office hours and leave. That’s not the leader I want for the future of USG. Personally, I think you should vote for someone with passion and proven USG experience. I have my opinion as to who I want to vote for, and it’s different from the DT Editorial Board. I’m voting for Austin and Morgan (FYI, I barely knew either of them until my term started) and I have more to say as to how I’ve formulated my opinion, so if you want to talk — shoot me an e-mail (hahneyyo@usc.edu) or find me on Facebook. But, regardless — you should go out and review the platforms and see who you want to vote for. Please vote. It’s important.

I’ve always considered myself a seasoned traveler. But I never realized, how much of a tourist I was. I went to famous places, took pictures, met fellow travelers and ate amazing food, but that was all I did. I’d never taken the time to learn about the places and cultures I encountered.
That changed during my trip to Japan this winter break. My experience made me realize that traveling can be so enriching if I just take the time to learn about the people around me.
I spent the first few days in Tokyo. It was fun, but I felt like an outsider. People seemed to function at a different wavelength. They were always polite, and they were always helpful, but I couldn’t connect with them somehow.
My next stop was Sapporo. I visited some family friends there and we spent the day exploring the city. At the end of the day, I mentioned how I felt out of place in Japan. They laughed then and said that I need to adapt if I wanted to experience the best things Japan can offer.
I realized then what I’ve been doing wrong. I never bothered to change my behavior. I ate on the subway, talked loudly in public places, blocked doorways and did a whole lot other things. I behaved rather rudely, maybe because a part of me didn’t care enough to make a good impression. I also always spoke in English, even to say “thank you” and “excuse me.”
I made my mind up then that I would respect the people and the culture of the places I visited. I decided to do all the things I failed to do my first few days in Japan.

After that, my trip became so much better. I began to learn about what to do and what not to do. I think the most interesting thing I learned was to move to one side on escalators. That way, people who were in a rush could walk faster. I also started to talk to people in Japanese. It was limited, but I could tell that they appreciated the gesture.
I went to Nara next. I have to say that people started treating me extra nice after I changed my behavior. I had a long conversation with a group of schoolgirls who were curious about the United States. I met an old man who gave me fruits and nuts that the local deer absolutely love. A street food vendor gave me extra steamed buns for free because I was able to say “arigatou gozaimasu” and “oishi” (those mean “thank you” and “delicious”).

One of the best travel experiences I’ve ever had was in Kyoto. I went on a hike at 5 a.m. in Mount Inari with locals to see the sun rise above the shrines. None of them could speak English, but they taught me how to wash my hands properly before entering sacred sites, how to attract cats around the area and so much more.
When I went back to Tokyo a few days later, I saw the city in a much different light. It made me realize that if there is one thing everyone needs to do when they travel, it’s to keep an open mind and to be willing to learn.

Where did the time go? Another week has passed by in what feels like a second. The craziness of the weekend has left me feeling tired and lazy. Not to mention my bedroom is a mess. I am a mess. I reflect on how I have not completed anything on my weekly checklist yet. 
Luckily, it is Sunday; it is my day. The personal time that I take for myself on Sundays typically prepares me for the entire week ahead. I run the dishwasher, I do laundry, I tidy up all of the clothes that litter the floor of my bedroom, I write in my planner, I shop for groceries, I take out the trash, I shower, I cook a real dinner, I clean the floor, I sometimes exercise and most importantly, I study. The Super Bowl slightly messed up my routine this week, but generally I am able to complete all of my tasks stress-free. Due to this routine, I wake up feeling motivated on Mondays. I begin my week feeling accomplished. I feel motivated to excel in school, socialize, exercise and complete the required tasks of my internship. Nothing is holding me back.
I also find my weekly motivation through interactions that I have with my family and friends from home. Typically, I will call my dad on Sundays. We usually talk on the phone more than just once a week, but Sunday’s talks are always the longest.  Although I realize that college is a time to gain independence away from home, the relationships that I have with people from home, such as my family, are ones that I do not want to distance myself from. I always make sure to call my dad because he is my cheerleader. He genuinely cares about my everyday life away from home and always wants to hear news regarding my friends and adventures at USC.  More importantly, he encourages me to do well in school and reminds me of previous goals that I have set for myself. The calls that I share with my dad, or really anyone important to me from my hometown make me feel like home isn’t so far away. 
My final way of gaining motivation for the upcoming week is through physical activity. Nothing makes you feel better than a good sweat. Luckily, the apartment complex that I live in has its own gym. So, I really do not have any excuses as to why I can’t make it to the gym. On Sundays I edit my gym Spotify playlist to include any new songs that I have heard throughout the week. When I eventually make it to the gym, I am usually pretty excited because I am eager to listen to my new music. My personal routine includes running three miles on the treadmill, a series of planks and ab exercises, lifting light weights and stretching. Post workout, I feel like I can take do anything. 
These are my ways of finding motivation so that I am ready to conquer the upcoming week. Let’s get motivated!

As I continue to search for hidden, caffeinated gems, Philz Coffee emerges above the rest. This coffeehouse is truly the antithesis of typical coffee shop chains. Quality reigns above quantity, a promise that I truly admire but wanted to test for myself.
If you’re in a rush for a quick cup of joe, then this place is not for you. As opposed to other coffee shop chains, baristas attend to each cup individually and make sure the drink is to your liking before moving on to the next customer. This individualized system ensures for a high quality drink that you’re sure to love.
The leather chairs, wooden tables and original art hanging on the walls offer a welcoming atmosphere to meet with friends, or to study in style. The exposed wooden beams, which seem to be a common theme in coffee shops, add to the texture and rustic charm of the space. Upon entering, friendly baristas recommended three popular drinks: Tesora, Mint Mojito Iced Coffee and Jacob’s Wonderbar.

The tesora is the sweet, yet savory combination of butter, nuts and caramel. I imagine this medium blend to be the caffeinated equivalent to the butter beer in Harry Potter.
By far, the mint mojito iced coffee has been the greatest drink I have tried on my coffee quest yet. Categorized as a “speciality coffee,” the mint mojito simply does not disappoint. This drink can best be described as creamy and sweet, while the mint cleanses the palette and invites you to take another sip. Not to my surprise, many other customers also ordered this drink.

Lastly, the jacob’s wonderbar, which was unfortunate to say the least. This dark blend had a chocolate and clove aftertaste that did not seem to add up for me. The drink seemed unbalanced; however, the barista was quick to adjust the flavors to my liking, which I appreciated. 
One cup at a time, Philz Coffee is changing the way a coffeehouse looks and feels. Each cup is personalized to your own specifications. The quality speaks for itself. Your perfect cup of joe awaits. 
Overall Grade: A-
Would return for the Mint Mojito and relaxing atmosphere

Following USC’s upset victory against UC Irvine on Friday, which ended a five-match losing streak, the men’s volleyball team looked to carry the momentum over and defeat UCSD one day later at home. Though USC had defeated the Tritons 44 out of the 52 times the two programs had played going into the match — with the Trojans taking the last six straight — UCSD narrowly edged out USC for a 4-1 win at the Galen Center on Saturday.
“We faced a great opponent in UCI and we were able to get the victory,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said in an interview with USC Athletics. “Then, the next night I felt that we were a little surprised at times how well [UCSD] was going to consistently get kills, make effort plays.”
UCSD’s junior opposite Tanner Syftestad led his team and the match with 26 kills, and he steered his side to its first MPSF victory since April 2014. While the Tritons set career highs for many of the players, it was not because of the Trojans’ lack of play on their side of the net.
The entire match was a series of back-and-forth scoring, with neither team being able to get the edge until the final points of each set. The first set was deadlocked at 23-23 before the Trojans took the set with two consecutive kills. The second set was just as tight as the first, with the two teams tied at 23-23. It would be the Tritons this time who scored two consecutive points to earn them the victory in the second set.
“I don’t feel like we were clicking that well, but we still managed to push them to deuce games every single game,” Nygaard said.
For USC, three players had kills in double figures. Senior outside hitter Lucas Yoder had 20, recently transferred sophomore outside hitter Gianluca Grasso tallied 14 and freshman opposite hitter Aaron Strange had 11. Along with putting up more kills than UCSD, the Trojans also ended the match with more assists and digs than the Tritons. 
“On paper, I would like to believe that our team should be beating that team 10 times out of 10,” Nygaard said. “But in there, we weren’t able to handle it.”
The total numbers may seem to contradict the final score, but the hitting percentages of each team tells the real story of how the game played out. The Trojans hit .252 in comparison to UCSD’s .317, which gave the Tritons a significant edge throughout the match. In addition to the superior efficiency, UCSD also recorded 14.5 team blocks, which was 6.5 more than USC’s total.
“We had come off a big win, and I felt our focus was there, which is why we were so frustrated when we made the errors,” Nygaard said. “It’s also that [UCSD] played a great game.”
Ultimately, the game was won through accuracy at the net. The addition of Grasso adds a new element to USC, which is rapidly being showcased the more games he gets under his belt. Grasso has notched double-digit kills in three of his four matches so far in Cardinal and Gold. The Trojans will look to feed off of Grasso as they take on three more tough teams during their four-game homestand. Next up is BYU, who will visit the Galen Center on Friday.
Please be in tune with the results. You can’t lose 4 to 1 when only 3 sets are needed to be a winner. The Volleyball
program is a mess under Coach Nygaard who had no business being hired in the first place. Two years of his pathetic
coaching and recruiting is more than enough. A former ‘ruin top player who his own school had no interest in hiring to
be the head coach. UCSD had lost every conference match for almost three seasons, and who
do they break the streak against the Trojans.

The No. 8 USC men’s tennis team traveled to the annual Pac-12/SEC Challenge in Gainsville, Fla. this weekend, and the Trojans split their two matches, suffering their first loss of the year to host No. 11 Florida to kick off the tournament on Saturday before grabbing an upset victory over No. 5 Georgia on Sunday. 
USC picked up the doubles point to open the match against the Gators. After the pair of senior Nick Crystal and sophomore Laurens Verboven beat Florida’s Chase Perez-Blanco and Maxx Lipman 6-3, senior Rob Bellamy and sophomore Jack Jaede put the Trojans on the board with a 7-5 win over McClain Kessler and Elliott Orkin.
But Florida stormed back to take four singles wins to secure victory, beating Crystal, sophomore Logan Smith, freshman Riley Smith and junior Thibault Forget. Jaede and freshman Brandon Holt tallied the last two points of the day, winning 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (6) and 3-6, 7-5, 6-2 over their Gator opponents, respectively, but the duo could only narrow the final margin of defeat to one point as USC fell 4-3.
After taking their first loss of the season on Saturday, the Trojans took on fifth-ranked Georgia on Sunday. Their 4-0 victory against the Bulldogs closed out the annual tournament in style, opening with a quick doubles victory by way of Bellamy and Jaede, who notched a 6-2 win over Georgia’s Wayne Montgomery and Nathan Ponwith. Minutes later, Holt and Riley Smith secured a 6-4 win to score the match’s first point.
Bellamy went on to beat Robert Loeb 6-2, 6-3, and Holt followed by setting USC up for a clincher with his 6-1, 6-4 victory over Emil Reinberg. Jaede then closed out the upset with a 6-1, 7-6 victory against Walker Duncan to send the Trojans home with a win.
USC will continue play with a doubleheader on Friday, as the Trojans host UC Davis and San Francisco at Marks Stadium.

Wow. Son of a gun. Good grief: Some 16 hours have passed since the conclusion of Super Bowl LI, and I’m still in utter disbelief as I sit to type out this column. 
When Patriots quarterback Tom Brady engineered a 25-point comeback in the late stages of regulation time Sunday, I, along with the millions of others watching, knew we had witnessed something truly iconic. Brady’s display of clutch, guts and skill in steering New England back was the finest football I have ever seen played on the gridiron. 
It seemed as if Murphy’s Law was constantly at play early on for the Pats — if it could go wrong, it did go wrong for them. I mean, even when the Pats finally cracked the goal line late in the third quarter on a James White touchdown, Patriots All-Pro kicker Stephen Gostkowski clanked the extra point off the right goal post. 
Following the rare blunder from Gostkowski, Atlanta led the Patriots, 28-9, with two minutes remaining in the third quarter. At this point, ESPN Stats and Info reported online that the Falcons had a 98.9 percent win probability. Atlanta owner Arthur Blank vacated his suite to come down to the sidelines to celebrate the first Lombardi Trophy in franchise history. 
What followed in the next hour of real time was the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history. The 51st playing of the NFL’s championship contest saw New England outscore the Falcons 19-0 in the fourth quarter to send the game to overtime. 
In overtime, the Patriots — gushing with momentum — drove the ball downfield and ended the game on a two-yard Lombardi-clinching touchdown run from White. 
To put things into perspective, the largest Super Bowl comeback before Sunday’s was 10 points; the Patriots overcame a 25-point deficit. 
I think it’s safe to say that this game will be passed down from football generation to football generation for quite a long time — possibly forever. On that hallowed day when the NFL reaches Super Bowl 100, I am confident that everyone (including a 68-year-old version of myself) will still look back on No. 51 with great admiration. 
Entering Sunday night’s spectacle, other folks with a half-decent, objective following of the NFL and I could have already told you this: Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time. 
While sifting through the Twitter-sphere and engaging in conversations with those around me, I marveled that people still felt there was any debate at all to this matter. Some still opted to go with the half-respectable Brady-Montana debate, which I could live with (but I had already felt Brady pulled ahead of his childhood hero before Super Bowl LI was played). 
Just a few weeks ago, I could not believe the disrespect I saw from sports media outlets nationwide. Folks that I thought were decent commentators on the game were crowning Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers as the greatest quarterback in the NFL. Some even mentioned him being the “Michael Jordan of football.” 
You’ve got to be kidding me, right? When I saw these debates running across my screen, I immediately rushed to the obituaries online to see if something tragic had happened to Brady, because they seemed to forget he existed. It really felt like the sports world was collectively anointing Rodgers as the GOAT that week before the NFC Championship Game before the Falcons put an abrupt halt to that chatter. 
And while the stat geeks and number-crunchers can give you thousands of numbers evaluating quarterback play, there is only one true measure of a signal caller’s worth: wins. Brady has undisputedly been doing this “winning” thing far longer and more consistently than anyone else in history. 
With 208 career wins as a starter, Brady is the winningest quarterback in NFL history. Brady’s 25-9 record in postseason play is also tops for most playoff wins of all time. And for those who are swayed by statistical measures, Brady ranks fourth all-time in both passing touchdowns (456) and yards (61,582). 
If you hadn’t caught this drift by now, then I must formally disclose that I am a New England Patriots fan. Yes, I am the very-hateable black sheep, a Patriots fan in Southern California. 
When it comes to hecklers, I’ve heard it all, from “bandwagon-er!” (which I can assure you I am not), to “deflator,” to “Beli-Cheater!” One of the newest insults tossed my way came a few weeks ago, when someone asked me, “You’re probably a Warriors fan, too, right?”
I can assure you that I am not a Golden State fan (my NBA loyalties, for better or worse, lie with the Lakers). I must also put it out there that I became a Pats supporter back in 2006 after I played Madden ’06 (Donovan McNabb cover) for the first time when I was just eight years old. 
Now that I’ve cleared that air, let’s get back to Sunday’s game. 
For the sole purpose of word count and tending to your attention span, I’ll just drop this nugget: With Sunday’s victory, Bill Belichick is also now the GOAT NFL coach. Dissecting this claim, however, is for another column on another day. 
As for the brightest shining star on Super Bowl Sunday, Brady picked up his fourth Super Bowl MVP award: an NFL record. A 466-yard, two-touchdown effort earned Brady the honor.
Words can’t explain how glorious it was seeing Brady and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell together Monday morning on the same stage for the Super Bowl MVP trophy presentation. 
Just how epic would it have been if Tommy whipped out an air pump on stage and pretended to inflate the MVP trophy — which actually resembles a football. 
But as usual, Brady was graceful in accepting the award from the commissioner, who was anything but graceful to him throughout the Deflategate saga. 
Looking back, what an incredible Super Bowl this was. But for me, it only cemented Brady’s legacy as the best to ever strap it up. 
Is he the GOAT? Two words: “Roger that.”

Nestled atop a scenic hill in Barnsdall Art Park, the concrete walls of the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery have long served as a harbor for public art and community discourse on Sunday. In a twist on traditional exhibitions, the gallery premiered its showcase of Ours is a City of Writers, a project exploring the intersectionality of contemporary art and writing. 
Through March 26, the space will host a variety of installations with accompanying texts, replete with complimentary refreshments and spontaneous performances. The free exhibit was organized by guest curators Suzanne Hudson, Simon Leung and James Nisbet, who invited writers and various types of artists alike to contribute. 
“We decided we would invite artists and writers who have some kind of relationship with writing and interest in the intersection between writing and art,” Leung said. “We reached out to them and asked them to further select people they’d like to work with. We didn’t put any restrictions so in some cases, people we invited selected people to also be in the show or collaborations developed as artists and writers worked on pieces together.”
The profound and unique freedom the curators gave the artists and writers meant that in the end, there was no cohesive theme or message to unite the pieces. Rather than a chronological display, the pieces were grouped throughout the exhibit according to medium, with sculptures on one side, installations on another and multimedia pieces in individual rooms. 
“There was no one theme. [The curators’] main goals were art and writing and how they come together,” gallery intern Adriana Luna said. “It’s kind of a collaboration between artists and writers, and the theme kind of just happened through that.”
LAMAG posed an interesting challenge to the curators in addition to being the quintessential venue at which to hold the exhibit; it remains one of the few municipal galleries in the city and allows open conversation between artists and the community in a public space. 
A previous coronation of the project exploring the relationship between art and writing was featured this month in The Brooklyn Rail, but the curators thought it apposite to establish an exhibit in Los Angeles. 
“Los Angeles is a city where people in the art world have some relationship to education or exist in institutions, so on a very real level, people are parts of communities where they have sustained discourse, or some way of talking about art,” Leung said. “Art writing in Los Angeles is also very organically tied to art production. The reality is that writing very much fits into how we work as artists.” 
Although the curators’ venture is young, it has already garnered widespread attention and appreciation from peers in the art and literary worlds as well the general public. Leung hopes to continue growing the collection of writings on the gallery’s website and eventually expand to more cities because he believes so strongly in the message the project encapsulates. 
“One of the things I’d really like to convey [through the exhibit] is that there is a contemplative dimension to the works which reflects back on the relationship between art and writing,” Leung said. “Another thing I wanted to emphasize is how something like friendship is, in fact, productive for making new work and how we develop a conversation among [artists and writers].”

One month into 2017, and junior Emily Lee hasn’t even officially started her New Year’s resolution. But she’s not too worried. If there’s one thing she learned from last year, it’s that things rarely ever stay on track, especially when she set out to run 2016 miles in 2016.
 That’s an average of 5 and a half miles per day. Lee read about the goal online, and immediately thought it was daunting, even for a pretty experienced runner like herself.
 “That’s a big misconception about runners, especially long distance,” Lee said. “Unless you’re at a very high level, people don’t do these crazy long distances.”
 However, after conquering her first two marathons in 2015, she was ready for the next challenge. Lee joined a Facebook group of thousands of other people around the world pursuing the same goal, and started tracking her miles.
 That online community was a great source of support for her. Eventually, Lee started posting updates about her runs on her Facebook account and rating each run based on how she felt. Lee was an RA last year, and the idea to rate her runs actually came from her residents following the endeavor. She decided to use these Facebook posts as a way to raise awareness for women and survivors of gender-based violence. Each running update had a link to a GoFundMe campaign, which Lee created to raise money for the Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services (RSVP) office in Engemann at USC.
The thing that stands out about her online track record of a year’s worth of runs is that there’s a lot of variation. As Lee points out, most serious runners have training cycles, not an exhaustive, constant slog. She’s also a big fan of rest days, so Lee doesn’t even run seven days a week. On slower weeks, she’ll run just two or three miles a day and do a longer run on the weekends. Even after months of building up mileage, there were still plenty of runs that just didn’t feel good, and Lee embraced that.
 “You can’t compare yourself to other people,” she said. “You have to be ok with a number of different of scenarios. When I was running [the Big Sur Marathon] in April, I was literally finishing my last day of antibiotics. I had bronchitis. I had to tell myself, ‘It’s OK if I walk. It’s OK if a lot of these older people pass me.’” Over the course of a year, Lee ran four marathons, and even the fourth one was no jog in the park. She was en route to a personal record marathon time when she was misdirected on the course. Her phone died, her fitness tracker died, and she didn’t get an official time that would qualify her for prestigious races like the Chicago or Boston marathons. It was a huge disappointment.
 Still, Lee was well on her way to finishing 2016 miles even a day or two early. However, an ankle injury with just a few weeks left to go set her back.
 “I had to take almost an entire week off, which meant that I would have to fit in 40, 50-plus miles into the last week, and I did it but it required a lot of planning because I had to do something morning and night and make sure I didn’t exacerbate my injury,” Lee said.
 On Dec. 31, 2016, Lee finished her 2016th mile against all odds and raised over $400 for RSVP.
 She says it was an astonishing feeling of accomplishment, but that doesn’t mean she’s stopping there. This year, Lee is going to do one mile better, and she’s looking forward to being more creative in her training runs.
 “My favorite run is running from campus to the Disney Concert Hall, and doing a couple of the hills around there.”
 Even with more than 2000 miles on her shoes, Lee still believes the short runs can go a long way.

It was a packed Saturday night at The Last Bookstore in downtown Los Angeles, where hardcovers and paperbacks lined the precariously tall shelves of the warehouse-like shop. The setting was abuzz with energy and conversation, and the air was filled with a sense of excitement.
At the center of the bottom floor, several rows of foldable chairs were set up facing a maroon couch — the latter dominated on an elevated stage. Three women occupied the first row: Michelle Tea (author of Black Wave), Tara Jepsen (author of Like a Dog), and Kait Heacock (author of Siblings and Other Disappointments). Shortly after introducing themselves, Tea rose from her seat to begin her reading of Black Wave.
“This book is weird, and I’m reading from a weirder part of it because I’ve read from it a lot lately, and I wanted to read from a part that I haven’t read from,” Tea said. “The thing you need to know is that the world is ending, and this funny thing has started to happen which is that people are having dreams about the people that they would have fallen in love with if the world [wasn’t] ending.” 
Black Wave follows the storyline of a female protagonist named Michelle, who worked in a bookstore in 1999. The excerpt Tea read from depicted Michelle as she cynically faced the reality of bookstore shoplifters and encountered Ashley, her 13-year-old lover from one of her dreams in real life. 
Following Tea was Jepsen, who, along with being an author (Like a Dog was her debut novel) also was an extra on the TV series Transparent. She also wrote and acted in the web series Rods and Cones. 
“I’m going to read from the first couple of pages of my book, Like a Dog, and it’s about my relationship with my brother,” Jepsen said. “But it’s all in fabricated circumstances.”
Like a Dog centers around Paloma, a skateboarder, who struggled to find her place between temporary, low-paying jobs. The novel focused on Paloma’s tumultuous interactions with her brother Peter, an irresponsible drug addict. Though the book spanned serious topics such as drug addiction, mental health, self-harm and job insecurity, the excerpt was filled with light-hearted humor and self-deprecating jokes. 
After Jepsen finished her reading, Heacock entered the stage to give the final reading of the night. Unlike Tea and Jepsen’s books, Heacock’s book, Siblings and Other Disappointments, was not a novel but was rather a collection of short stories.
“This book is really the map of my childhood,” Heacock said. “It’s really a love letter to the sh-tty hometown that I’m from — Yakima, Washington. It’s about family, and it’s about the myriad ways that they disappoint us and we disappoint them.”
The story Heacock read from was also the title of the book, Siblings and Other Disappointments. The plot follows adult siblings Elizabeth and Ray as they reflect upon their lives and relations to the house they were currently living in, the house they grew up in. This story was based on Heacock’s own brother, who passed away three years ago while Heacock was editing this story. 
The end of Heacock’s reading marked the end of the feminist book event, and the three authors were able to mingle with one another as well as with the audience and fans.

A hardcore fan of Mad Men, I have watched the entire series … twice. Through seven seasons Don Draper taught me that the best advertising stems from memories and nostalgia and is driven by common desire. What do people want? What do they all have in common?
It all comes down to the so-called American Dream, which isn’t as cheesy as it sounds. We live in a society where your status is defined and determined by material wealth. What you own demonstrates, albeit wrongly, how hard you’ve worked and how good you’ve got it. However, the commercials that aired during the Super Bowl last Sunday struck a different note. Praised for their diversity and their subversion of Trumpian values, they focused not on the products they were selling but on the universal benefits that come along with them. 
Above all, these commercials demonstrated that the American Dream, and what lives inside it, is pervasive and endless. It touches all of us, regardless of who we are, in the same way. Sure, depicting diversity can be seen as corporations capitalizing off the turmoil of the times, but consider the risks of airing such messages during a program that is heavily popular with white men (the majority of whom voted President Donald Trump into office). How were companies to know that their carefully and boldly-crafted statements would not alienate consumers? 
The Coca-Cola ad, for example, featured different scenes of people singing “America the Beautiful,” in languages from regions across the world. Perplexingly polarizing, many decried the ad on social media for playing the song in non-English languages. Jump to the other end of the spectrum, however, and you’ll see people and headlines celebrating the commercial’s bold diversity — how defiantly good it must feel to play a commercial like this in the face of all the hate and ignorance in the world.
And yet, why do the very images of people of color speaking different languages necessitate a commercial being “political”? Clearly, the Coke ad is a stunning testament to diversity and multiculturalism packaged neatly in a marketing scheme to sell soda. But be careful about being too giddy about advertisements that depict minorities, about the hard-hitting headlines declaring last Sunday’s commercials to be “political” through their depiction of diversity. Be careful about this reaction because what I can tell you is that no person of color wants to be held up on a throne to joyous cries of, “Look at this diverse person! Look at how proud we are of ourselves, for putting non-white people on TV!”
It is a hard road to take, because the very existence of people of color doesn’t make something “political,” and saying so would make it tokenism. But at the same time, Trump and his administration have proven time and time again that minorities are not welcome in their vision of America. What could rile him more than images of people of color joyously partaking in the American experience, clutching onto this part of their identity with so much strength as if to say, “Look at us. We make this country beautiful. We are here to stay.”
What’s striking when you watch these commercials is how they present, in earnest and without regard for politics, the promise of a country shared by everyone. In both the content and collectiveness of their messages, the ads are remarkable not because they are thrusting diversity in our faces, but because they exist so easily on their own outside of context. In the Coca-Cola ad, an Asian American dad and a white dad rollerblade with their daughter. What’s so political about a happy family?
A handful of Sunday’s commercials, nevertheless, were clearly and suitably more overt in their anti-Trumpian gestures: most notably a moving commercial for 84 Lumber that depicted a mother and her young daughter traversing Mexican deserts, streets and a river as they journeyed toward the border. A second portion of the commercial, determined too controversial for air time, can be accessed at journey84.com, with the pair coming to a sprawling, insurmountable wall blocking their path. They enter through a door left behind by one of the construction workers, the commercial closing with the statement: “The will to succeed is always welcome here.”
Call me a sap, but I cried.
It is indeed a movement in the making when on the day families and friends sit down to enjoy the most American of pastimes, they converge at their television sets to be confronted instead with an inescapable truth between the plays: the reality of a diverse America, happy and strong.
Two viewings of all seven Mad Men seasons taught me that good advertisements are tied always to people’s heartstrings, and the best ones know exactly what it is that people want. Ads align themselves with the American Dream, asking us to envision a more fulfilled version of ourselves and our families. In this way they manipulate us into giving them our money, but they also clearly parallel current American values. In a year so fraught with our differences and divisions, this year’s Super Bowl commercials dared to wager that what we all want is the same. 
Maybe it is the wish to raise headstrong daughters. Maybe it is to come home to your parents, to tuck your kids into bed. Maybe it is to spend the rest of your life with the person you love. Or maybe, for all of us, it is as simple as a Coke.

As President Donald Trump signs one oppressive executive order after another, silence has become complicity in the abuse of marginalized people. Though Trump’s executive order effectively banning the immigration of peaceful people from seven Muslim-majority countries has been met with mixed success, it reveals this administration’s intent to stigmatize and quarantine already marginalized people — namely Muslims — over the next four years. 
As of fall 2016, 24.1 percent of USC’s student population is international. On college campuses in particular, diversity on the basis of race, faith and of course, nationality, is rampant. Intellectual innovation, discussion and community ultimately rely on this diversity. Thus, silence among students, especially those with the privilege of not being discriminately attacked by the Trump administration, is no longer acceptable. 
Within its first week, the executive order left numerous students attending U.S. colleges separated from their families, detained in various airports and concerned about how they would return to their campuses and attend school.
Trump’s concerning treatment of Americans on the basis of nationality and identity ultimately reveals the extent to which privilege increasingly comes with obligation. It is crucial for students who are not experiencing this fear to actively take steps to support and fight for the rights of their peers who are being oppressed. This is primarily because they can afford to; students with the privilege of confirmed status in this country have far less at stake when they express opposition to the government.
Within USC, the immediate response to the ban on immigrants from Muslim-majority countries by the administration is encouraging. Last week, Provost Michael Quick issued a memorandum titled “Supporting Our International Community” on behalf of President C. L. Max Nikias and the administration at large. The memorandum did not condemn the immigration restrictions outright, but expressed strong support for USC’s international community and the right of students of all backgrounds and nationalities to attend USC. 
USC’s Office of International Services has conveyed similar sentiments and organized a meeting with an immigration attorney for affected students. It bodes well that the university not only recognizes the power of diversity but also actively works to protect this diversity, as a means to broaden academic and cultural horizons and foster empathetic citizenship.
The focus then shifts to the actions that USC students can take to support their peers. It may not feel like individual contributions, whether by donating money or sharing sentiments on social media, make a difference. 
But there exists a wide spectrum of ways to get involved, from showing up to protests in solidarity to contributing to the American Civil Liberties Union and immigration law firms.  Students should consider how their own social privilege — or lack thereof — plays into their ability to mitigate the damaging effects of the executive order. When it comes to showing up at protests, or even publicly opposing the immigration ban, they don’t face threats of detainment or deportation. Organizations such as the ACLU, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights and numerous others have volunteer opportunities and donation pages. At USC, the Muslim Student Union and USC Meals 4 Refugees have hosted numerous solidarity events.
As of this week, the executive order is entangled in legal complications. Sanctuary cities and universities across the nation are refusing to cooperate while the White House remains steadfast. Ultimately, the situation remains volatile for students from the seven countries involved, and silence from students with the privilege of being unaffected by the order is not only immoral, but also deeply damaging to academia. Diversity is a hallmark of higher education, and it is the responsibility of not only the administration but also students to protect it.

The Million-Vorhoff and Rachel-Rebecca Undergraduate Student Government campaigns are working jointly to file a complaint against the Austin-Morgan campaign with Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards, according to Hashim Osman, the campaign manager for the Million-Vorhoff ticket.
The move follows the results of an appeals hearing with the USG Judicial Council, which issued extra sanctions to the Austin-Morgan campaign after the other two tickets accused them of breaking election rules by starting their campaign early.
The tickets alleged that USG presidential and vice presidential candidates Austin Dunn and Morgan Monahan created a secret Facebook group roughly 32 hours before the official campaign period began. The ticket received two strikes from the Elections Commission, after which the Million-Vorhoff and Rachel-Rebecca campaigns filed appeals with the USG Judicial Council. 
“This entire debacle has made us mistrust the entire organization,” Osman said.
The Judicial Council unanimously decided to issue two additional strikes and sanctions against the Austin – Morgan campaign, fining them for two-thirds of their election funds, which is roughly $1,000 out of the $1,500 allotted to their ticket. The Rachel-Rebecca campaign also received one strike in a separate case. 
Osman, however, advocated for complete disqualification of the Austin-Morgan campaign.
“All the evidence is there. It’s in the audio, it’s in the transcripts,” Osman said. “They [had] so many violations, they had a Facebook group, they had instances where USG directors were involved, but we’re not even pondering that now. We just want to see change.”
Dunn said that they have focused their efforts on voter turnout and student advocacy in light of the recent accusations.
“It was extremely disheartening to receive these personal attacks,” Dunn said. “We made  a mistake at the beginning of the campaign and have run a perfectly clean campaign since.”
Sen. Tiffany Lian, who supports the Austin-Morgan campaign, said that the accusations placed are not warranted.
“It’s really disturbing to me [what Osman] writes about this incident,” Lian said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “He states that certain current USG figures participated in helping them cheat when it was very clearly stated in the judicial proceedings that this was not the case.”
According to Lian, additional allegations Osman made in a Facebook post on Monday were incorrect. Lian said Sen. Paul Samaha and President Edwin Saucedo did not participate in the selection of the Judicial Council. Additionally, in response to another allegation by Osman, Dunn and Monahan do not have access to the USG website.
“I think it’s funny that their campaign manager talks about how egregious it is that Austin-Morgan are breaking the rules. He says that since they’re breaking the rules, he will too now,” Lian said. “It’s also interesting to me how their campaign manager is bending facts for shock factor, which has happened as well by the presidential candidate that he represents.” 
Ultimately, Osman said he wanted to see a revised elections system.
“This is a real issue, and we just want the changes so that all students can have fair representation,” Osman said. “Now that everything is out there, we can see some real changes for the future.”

Ahead of the completion of the USC Village, the University has also dedicated itself to other construction efforts on campus.
Joe Back, associate senior vice president for campus development and facilities management, said the new entrance on Jefferson Boulevard, which opened at the beginning of this semester, is a continuation of the work already completed in other areas of campus, all of which move toward a more pedestrian-friendly campus. The vision for this includes enhanced hardscape, landscape and additional trees. 
“Trousdale Parkway is a primary entry point to campus from Jefferson Boulevard,” Back said. “It is subject to heavy pedestrian and bicycle use from the Hoover-Jefferson intersection. The new entry provides a critical symbolic and aesthetic connection to the new Village at USC,  [which is] currently under construction.”
The project scope includes new trees, landscaping and hardscape with brick paving, area light fixtures, fencing, gates and new entry markers, according to Back. 
“The hardscape area of this entry has been expanded significantly to accommodate the increased pedestrian and bicycle traffic that will result at the completion of the Village at USC,” Back said.
Kelly Pascual, a freshman majoring in business administration, said she is excited to finally see the new renovations on campus, but admits that getting to class has been more difficult because of all the construction. 
“It can get annoying having to change the route I’m accustomed to, but it’s been going on for so long I’m used to it at this point,” Pascual said. “Although it can be annoying, it’s exciting to see the progress of these new buildings.” 
Emeli Castillo, a junior majoring in linguistics and psychology, like most students, has found it difficult to become accustomed to the ongoing construction.
“I do think that it’s a great campus expansion that will definitely benefit current and future students; however, it is annoying due to the constant noise that takes place during lectures in the buildings close to the construction,” Castillo said. 
Jasmin Nunez, a junior majoring in urban studies and planning, worries about the surrounding community and how the construction will impact the neighborhoods around USC.
“The University needs to be more sensitive as to how all these expansions affect the surrounding community, especially in a place like downtown Los Angeles where the community is continuously being displaced,” Nunez said. “At the same time, I think it is necessary because of how much alumni want to invest in the University in order to make it as great and as safe as possible.”

Meleeka Akbarpour, a sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, was looking forward to seeing her grandmother for the first time this year. Akbarpour’s grandmother, an Iranian citizen and United States permanent resident, had planned to visit the U.S. and Canada to witness the birth of a grandchild. 
But after President Donald Trump issued an executive order which barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iran, from entering or leaving the country, Akbarpour started to worry that she would not be able to see her grandmother anytime soon.
“With my grandma’s green card, she has to be in the U.S. at least every six months, or else her green card can be revoked,” Akbarpour said. “I questioned if [the government is] doing this indirectly to revoke some people’s green cards.”
Though the ban has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge, Akbarpour is one of many USC students who was affected by Trump’s executive order, both personally and within their families.
Trump’s executive order also affected the Pakistani grandparents of Aamna Asif, the president of the Muslim Student Union. Asif and her family, all of whom are American citizens, have been trying to help Asif’s grandparents obtain American citizenship as Asif said that they’re getting older and their health is deteriorating. But Asif fears Trump’s executive order will create complications for all Muslims trying to enter the United States, though Pakistan was not one of the banned countries. 
“It’s important to recognize that this ban is specifically targeting Muslims, and it’s affecting a lot of people,” Asif said.
According to the USC Office of International Services, more than 200 students originate from countries impacted by the executive order: Iran, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Sudan and Somalia. While the order has not stranded any students abroad, Provost Michael Quick issued a statement urging affected individuals to stay in the country to avoid complications upon trying to return. 
But Asif said Trump’s executive order is not the only thing harming the Muslim community. Asif believes that, like many other news events that involve Muslims, Trump’s executive order has led to a problematic and inaccurate media representation of Muslims, as it focuses on negative events without highlighting the positive impact Muslims have in their respective communities. 
“It’s really hurtful because a lot of us were born here, grew up here,” Asif said. “This is our country — the county that we love.”
Asif’s criticism of Muslim representation in the media extends to student journalists as well. She said the extensive media coverage Muslim students receive is contradicted by a lack of action from the student journalists who interview them. 
“I’ve been getting so many emails and messages from Annenberg students now, when the Muslim community is facing such hardship, rather than when we’re doing so many amazing things,” Asif said. “It’s important to be aware of our community in these times as well, but if these students were allies, they’d be there year-round, in the good times and bad.” 
For Afsara Haque, MSU’s public relations coordinator, the constant media coverage surrounding Muslims has become a source of personal pressure, as she found herself having to speak for a diverse group of people.
“I became an ambassador for my faith when I actually didn’t want to be part of that role,” Haque said. “Having Muslims in the media all the time puts a spotlight on Muslims in general, especially when you are that one Muslim person that people know.”
Asif stressed cultural and religious sensitivity when interviewing Muslim students and religious figures. She said she wants to see genuine interest in the support and success of the Muslim community, regardless of what happens in the news. 
“I want to see that if you’re trying to display our narrative, you’re trying to be our ally,” Asif said. “You’re standing up for our rights, whether it’s at a rally or event, not just finishing a school project.”
While Asif sees Trump’s executive action as “concerning and terrible,” exposure to Islamophobic rhetoric or policies is not new to her. 
“This isn’t a new thing, ever since 9/11,” Asif said. “But it’s a wake up call, and we hope it brings out the best of other people who may not have stood up for these groups before.” 
It’s a 90 day travel restriction and it will be over soon enough. Remember this… Americans and folks around them world have been inconvenienced, with travel hold ups and se c unity check points, since 9/11.  Just make sure your mom has filed the appropriate paperwork to the US consulate so that she can come to the US.  Life is not ending, but if we don’t take better care of our borders and institute protective measures at US Customs and higher investugati o ns of foreign travellers, life might end for you and folks you know.  
It is common sense thinking that states that you do not allow anyone coming into your home without knowing who there are and why they want to come into your home.  Same holds true for our country.
Sir, you need to review the oral arguments in Washington & Minnesota v. Trump.
With respect to the claim that “life is not ending”, there actually are certain cases where the Executive Order could result in “irreparable damage” to a person.
Delays to the matriculation of university students who are completely innocent of wrong doing are completely and totally unacceptable.
Instead of punitive measures being taken against innocent people, you should consider how you would feel if the terrorist act of ten people were to cause you to lose the right of travel.
Sir.. Excuse me, but you need to read the Constitution which clearly and unequivocally grants this very discretion to the President (any president, no matter the party).  As with any governmental action, innocent people will be affected.  The same occurs at the airport every single day. Innocent people are caught up in security lines, going through metal detectors and possibly patted down… not because all passengers are dangerous or terrorists, but because there is a possibility that even one might be.  
A 90 Day travel ban from only 7 nations does not deserve the histrionics presented by the Left.  Pull it together!!  These 7 nations were singled out by the Obama administration as potential threats because they do not have policies or promises in place to work with the United States in properly vetting travelers.  Other nations not on the list do have such programs in place.  The Constitution places this right of judgment squarely in the hands of the sitting President.
What is happening in the courts right now is a political circus.  The 9th Circuit has a history of advancing Leftist social agenda.  It is not an exercise of judicial review or jurisprudence.  Don’t take my word for it; Many of their decisions are overturned.  I have no problem with honest debate, but sometimes in life we are lucky enough to be presented with irrefutable clarity.  The President is provided statutory and Constitutional discretion when it comes to regulation of immigration policy.   For example, the previous administration (at its discretion) chose to essentially look the other way when it came to illegals in our country… a policy that is actually in conflict with existing immigration law.  How come nobody challenged that?  Where was the outrage then?  Where were the campus riots by students who were legally attending on visas?  Perhaps it was because conservatives understood the latitude and discretion the President had in the matter.  Nevertheless, and by the same measure, the current administration is choosing to apply, administer and enforce existing immigration law.. an inherently more fair and equitable approach.
The reality is that it was President Obama who put USC students and families (and many across the nation) in limbo with his Dreamers act… a very temporary reprieve that he and everyone should have known could be revoked by any subsequent administration.
