Managing editor Raymond Rapada will step in as the Daily Trojan’s editor-in-chief after Natalie Oganesyan announced her resignation from the position in a letter to Daily Trojan staff Friday. 
In her letter, Oganesyan cited personal losses and mental health reasons for her resignation, saying that she could not carry on as a leader who prioritizes mental health, compassion and inclusion without extending the same principles to herself. 
“Raymond is beyond talented, empathetic and considerate, and I have so much faith in them as a capable, compassionate leader,” Oganesyan wrote in her letter. “He has been my rock countless times, and their goals of equity and justice in the newsroom and paper align with my vision for the future of DT.” 
Rapada, a senior majoring in journalism, has been on the Daily Trojan staff since he transferred to USC in Fall 2019. He immediately took on the role of opinion editor, then joined the managing team in Spring 2020. Rapada met Oganesyan through the Daily Trojan and said he remembers walking back to his dorm with her, where she was an RA, after working nights in the newsroom together.
“I consider Natalie one of my first friends at USC,” Rapada said. “She has always been supportive of me, and I’ve always been supportive of her. I think it definitely took a lot of strength for her to come to the decision to step down, which I really admire about her.”
Rapada will serve as editor-in-chief until the end of the fall semester, when there will be an election for Spring 2021 leadership. He said that in the next two months he wants to use the recent findings of the diversity staff report to address inequalities within the newsroom. 
“As a newsroom, we cannot adequately and fairly report on our campus and student body when our staff lacks the diversity in race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, socioeconomic status and abilities of our campus,” Rapada said. “I really want to work toward making the Daily Trojan a safe and accessible space for students to come from underrepresented and underserved communities to work in and tell their stories.”

Sporting his signature gold chains and colorful “Pro 1973 Roe” merch in support of protecting Roe v. Wade, Yung Gravy’s positive energy jumped through the screen in his press conference on Wednesday. The rapper, first made famous through his SoundCloud hits, “Whip A Tesla” and “Mr. Clean,” began freestyling with his friends in high school, but did not pursue music until late in his college career. As evident from his fun, upbeat tracks and laid-back attitude, Gravy is big on not taking himself too seriously. 
In order to maintain his normal life as a marketing student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Gravy started his career anonymously. About two or three months before graduating, he revealed his face via the music video for his track “Mr. Clean,” which blew up on SoundCloud.
Since then, Yung Gravy signed with Republic Records in November and has continued to impress with hits that are both funny and impressive, featuring top-notch bars and beats. He explained how coming up in the SoundCloud rapper community gave him various connections and friends who became future collaborators.
In Gravy’s words, they share a “sample banger style” that originates from a “SoundCloud sort of sound . . . shorter songs, distorted 808s . . . I still stay true to it; just sounds better to me.”
The platform helped circulate his music outside of his home state of Minnesota, which Gravy said is a more challenging local scene to come up in as it has bred rappers such as Prof, Atmosphere and ModSun. He dubbed watching the sudden rise of “One Night” by Lil Yachty, who went to high school with a friend of his, as the inspiration that drove him to officially start making music.
Gravy made the most of quarantine, writing the entirety of “Gasanova” in his newfound free time away from his usual touring lifestyle. When asked what three words Gravy would use to describe his album, he chimed, “thumps,” “carefree” and “gas.” These words are a reflection of the “positive energy” Gravy wants listeners to take away from his music.
“I think the confidence that [my music] helps give some people is one of my favorite parts,” he said.
He went on to describe what he wants for his listeners — to not overthink or be critical of themselves and to enjoy what’s around them. 
“Just kind of being able to kick back and enjoy themselves and not stress about what’s going on on social media . . . there’s too much, like, judging people,” Gravy said, “and I think it’s dope to just go and feel like you can express yourself and be confident.”
Gravy named “Always Saucy” as his favorite track to make on the new album. It features verses by TrippyThaKid and Ski Mask The Slump God (who rarely features on tracks). Gravy discussed being especially excited about the track’s sample from the theme song of “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” In the conference, he also teased future collaborations with Thundercat, Zack Fox and his wish to work with popular YouTube comedic rappers Cody Ko and Noel Miller.
Building on his soul influence, Gravy’s early hits sampled “Mr. Sandman” by The Chordettes and other oldies from the 1950s to 1970s. Gravy hints that “the album that we’re dropping Friday has a decent amount of that sample and sound, just the main difference now is it’s a lot easier to just create your own samples than it is to clear them …”
His personal fashion even reflects the oldies style, as seen in music videos like the one for his track “yup!” Never straying too far from his musical roots, Gravy emphasized how he wants to stay true to his soul sound, citing Bryson Tiller’s album “TRAPSOUL” as a similar vibe.
“Twenty years ago or more like maybe 50 years ago I just think some of the style was so dope . . . some of the disco steez,” Gravy said.
He shouted out the team that makes the process of creating unique sounds fun and creative.  Overall, Gravy is very involved in the creative process, from creating album covers to designing music video concepts.
Fans, who Gravy refers to as his “Gravy Train,” should be excited about this new album release and his development as an artist. He seems to care a lot about his fans, even reminiscing about a proposal that happened between two fans at one of his meet-and-greets.
His new single, “Gas Money,” has been out since Sept. 18, and its catchy, clever lyrics and hot beat are great indicators for Gravy’s future releases.
“Gasanova” is available on Friday across all streaming platforms.

Red lips, feathered bangs and a voice that has spanned decades — Selena Quintanilla Perez, Grammy-winning Mexican American singer known to many as Selena, released her fifth and final studio album, “Dreaming of You,” posthumously 25 years ago. Though her untimely death left many with a heavy heart, the singer’s legacy and presence in pop culture still persists to this day.
The first song I ever heard from Selena was “Bidi Bidi Bom Bom,” the final track from the English-Spanish crossover album “Dreaming of You.” I was around 10 years old, watching the music video and listening to her voice — her energy seemed to instantly fill the room. In the video, filmed on Santa Monica’s famous pier, Selena is joined by a group of people dancing and singing. The video cuts between bright clips of Selena and her friends smiling with sunlight beaming down on the ocean, playing games on a date with a man at the pier and driving her baby blue Jeep around Los Angeles. 
Along with Selena’s contagious energy and undeniable stage presence, her music reaches many, reflecting both personal and shared human experiences in many facets of her lyrics. Her songs range from striking confessionals such as “Amor Prohibido” and “Dreaming of You,” to more playful, lighthearted ballads like “Bidi Bidi Bom Bom.”
Featuring multiple English-language songs, the posthumous release of “Dreaming of You” in 1995 was an instant success, reaching No. 1 on the Billboard top 200 charts that year — the first predominantly Spanish-language album to do so — and going on to become the best-selling Latin pop album for two years after its release. Though Selena did not live to see the success of “Dreaming of You,” she continues to inspire many young Latinx artists and fans today. 
Beginning with “I Could Fall In Love,” a soft pop-rock ballad, the tracklist takes influence from multiple genres. From R&B to soul, cumbia and rock, Selena’s music takes listeners through catchy drum beats, personal stories, smooth vocals and upbeat melodies.  
Transitioning from mid-tempo to a faster-paced electro-pop beat, the song that follows is “Captive Heart.” Similarly, in the mood to the preceding “I’m Getting Used To You,” the song brings in horns, synthesizers and percussion. 
One of Selena’s signature hits comes during the latter half of the album — “Amor Prohibido,” which translates to “Forbidden Love” in English. The song is reflective of cumbia dance-pop and is the title track of her fourth studio album. 
“Amor prohibido murmuran por las calles / Porque somos de distintas sociedades / Amor prohibido nos dice todo el mundo / El dinero no importa en ti y en mí, ni en el corazón” she sings. Despite being about a man and a woman who have had their love tested by poverty, societal differences and family disapproval, the song has a happy, upbeat, feel-good instrumentation of guitars, accordions and flutes. 
Succeeding “Amor Prohibido” is a slower ballad, “Wherever You Are (Donde Quiera Que Estes),” and “Techno Cumbia” ––  a fusion of sounds but ultimately influenced by Latin dance and club pop music. 
Captivating the world with her popular hit song, “Como La Flor,” the track features a catchy Tejano-style cumbia chorus and beautiful lyrics about being heartbroken yet finding the strength to move on. 
Many artists from all genres of music today take inspiration from Selena, including Eva Longoria, Adrienne Bailon, Jackie Cruz, Daddy Yankee and Demi Lovato. From sampling her music to covering her songs, this beloved artist remains an icon in pop culture and across the music industry. 
More recently, Mac Cosmetics released its second cosmetic collection inspired by Selena earlier this year. The makeup line boasts red lipstick, rhinestones and color palettes inspired by the “Queen of Tejano Music.”
Although there is no set premiere date, Netflix is expected to premiere “Selena: The Series,” a coming-of-age television series about the late singer’s life and rise to fame later this year. Christian Serratos, an American actress of Mexican descent who adores the star, is set to play the lead. In the trailer, Serratos can be seen flipping through the script’s pages cut between scenes of a young Selena dressed in one of her iconic looks — a deep purple glitter bootcut jumpsuit — putting on a record and dancing to her song as her mother watches. 
This won’t be the first time Selena’s story has been told and commemorated through popular media, as Jennifer Lopez played the artist in the 1997 biographical drama, “Selena.” Lopez, who is of Puerto Rican descent, also cites Selena as one of her musical inspirations. 
From television specials, documentaries, novels and film biographies, Selena Quintanilla Perez will remain a voice remembered through time. Her talent was true. Her voice was honest. And her music and legacy lives on.

Over the past decade, the forces of state violence have pushed the names of numerous Black victims of police brutality into the realm of metonymy. Their names have been invoked as the rallying cry of collective action echoed across the globe. Their images have been reproduced on murals, billboards, posters and across social media, cementing them as ancestors of the Black Lives Matter movement and icons in our collective history and consciousness. 
It is not uncommon to see the likenesses of victims of police brutality placed atop altars, surrounded by flowers, candles and posters calling for justice as if the victims themselves were religious sacrament. However, these actions of reverence, though well-intentioned, can communicate a damaging narrative about the role of victims of police brutality in the movement against state violence.
While it is important that we never forget and continue to learn the names of the thousands of victims of police violence, it is also crucially important that we make one thing clear: These people are not martyrs.
The term martyr is both a noun and a verb. As a noun, it is defined as “a person who sacrifices something of great value and especially life itself for the sake of principle.” The operative word here is “sacrifice;” to sacrifice something implies a level of agency that victims of police brutality are violently stripped of. Not only is referring to these victims as martyrs fallacious, but the implication of agency also distorts the systemic nature of these murders. 
As a verb, the word “martyr” means “to put to death for adhering to a belief, faith, or profession.”  
Over the past five years alone, on-duty police officers have killed more than 5,000 people, with Black people accounting for nearly 25% of those victims despite making up only around 13% of the United States population. 
If these victims died for a belief, faith or profession, it was the belief that they could go to bed in their own homes and wake up the next morning, the faith that they could go for a jog around their neighborhoods and make it home alive, the profession of being Black and breathing. 
Black people are not sacrificing their lives to prove a point — they are being senselessly and unsolicitedly murdered in the streets, in their homes and on playgrounds and that is the point. Far from aberrations, these murders reflect pervasive systems of injustice that stem from centuries of racialized violence dating back to the United States post-Civil War Reconstruction and even further to the antebellum period. 
Historically, these murders have been termed “lynchings,” defined as “extrajudicial killing by a group.” Derived from the term “Lynch Law,” coined in the early 19th century, the term “lynching” readily evokes early- to mid-century American images of Black suffering and death as witnessed within the public sphere. In their depictions, these images draw sharp parallels to modern-day videos and accounts of police violence. 
Not only have names like George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, Nina Pop, Sandra Bland, Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin and Philando Castile among so many more ,been emblematized, but the narratives, videos and images surrounding their deaths have also permeated the public sphere, nonconsensually binding the trauma of their deaths into our collective consciousness. 
In her 1895 book “The Red Record,” Black liberation activist, journalist, newspaper editor and sociologist Ida B. Wells Barnett tabulated the statistics and alleged causes of lynching in the United States in an effort to define lynching as “[our] country’s national crime … not the creature of an hour, the sudden outburst of uncontrolled fury, or the unspeakable brutality of an insane mob.” 
This appraisal of the uniquely American phenomenon of lynching holds eerily true in its application to the modern-day phenomenon of police violence against Black people. Until we stop manufacturing martyrdom and accept the weighted reality that the cruel American legacy of lynching has not ceased but only transformed its shape, we will never fully understand its impacts, both on the Black community and on the world. Unless we call these modern-day lynchings what they are, denoting the history of racial oppression that accompanies that moniker, we cannot begin to dismantle the system of state violence that perpetuates Black death.

In light of op-eds and social media comments regarding former Undergraduate Student Government (USG) Vice President Rose Ritch’s resignation, we would like to bring to the attention of Daily Trojan readers our “Open Letter to the USC Community,” published on usc-faaz.org and signed by 43 distinguished USC faculty members.
We, the authors of this letter, are also two of the signatories. We write to communicate the main points raised in the Open Letter and offer our personal opinions. The Open Letter expresses an important perspective absent in previous Daily Trojan articles on the subject.
The Open Letter’s signatories, who include prominent members of national and international academies, dedicated educators and researchers in medicine, science, humanities, the arts and communication and champions of human rights and free speech, are calling on the campus community to reject the climate of discrimination and intolerance that led to Ritch’s resignation.
The Open Letter raised concerns that “Rose Ritch was subjected to vicious online harassment, and her qualification to hold elected office was questioned on the basis of her professed Zionism.”
Personally, we believe that anti-Zionism is just as reprehensible as any other form of identity-based prejudice or hatred. We do not address here whether the attacks on Ritch originated from anti-Semitism (the subject of an Aug. 24 Daily Trojan letter to the editor and an article in Inside Higher Education). Nor do we address the point that, for some, Zionism is merely a political opinion. What is important is that, for Ritch, Zionism constitutes an important component of her identity as a Jew, and she felt unable to continue her elected service in USG due to repeated acts of intimidation on account of her professed Zionist identity. A climate that permits such intimidation has no place on our campus.
The Open Letter states that no student should experience discrimination on the basis of his or her beliefs, identity or national origin.
The Open Letter rejects “attempts to associate Zionism with such inflammatory accusations as racism, colonialism, and white supremacy, which are diametrically antithetical to Zionist ideas and aims. We are appalled that such characterizations of Zionism were the basis for calls for Rose Ritch’s resignation, and continue to be voiced by certain organizations on this campus.”
The Open Letter further states, “As supporters of the Zionist idea — the right of the Jewish people to a homeland and self-determination — we stand by the rights of all people, including Israelis and Palestinians, to freedom, dignity and peaceful coexistence, and to advocate for their causes with fairness and respect on our campus and in the world.”
What happened to Ritch is unacceptable to us because it reveals that merely being a supporter (or presumed supporter) of Israel can be considered by some to be a disqualifying factor when  holding a leadership position on campus. The Open Letter adds that this concerns “Jewish students, faculty, and staff at USC, dedicated contributors to this campus’s excellence and visibility, whose fitness to continue their service may come under attack.”
The Open Letter is not a petition. It does not demand specific actions from our campus leadership. We understand that education and culture change take time, and we are optimistic that the initiatives put forward by President Carol Folt and reaffirmed in Provost Charles Zukoski’s reply to the Open Letter will eventually bear fruit. We know that understanding complex issues such as the Middle East conflict requires significant intellectual investment and does not result in simplistic answers. Rather, the Open Letter is an invitation to reflect on what we, as a community, define as a climate of inclusion, respect for diverse opinions and civil exercise of democracy.
However, the two of us personally believe that students and faculty who identify as Zionists should be recognized on our campus as an identity-bonded group and treated with the same respect afforded other groups under the big tent of diversity and inclusion. We also believe that identity politics should not taint academic life and should not be employed to evaluate candidates for elected leadership positions. This is particularly important in view of the upcoming elections to USG.
As the Open Letter concludes, “We call on our university’s leadership to uphold the values of open and civilized debate, so that USC can continue its mission of fostering excellence in education and advancing knowledge in a civil and respectful manner.”
We encourage students and faculty to read the Open Letter in full to better understand our position and the reasons for our alarm.
Respectfully,
Arieh Warshel, Department of Chemistry; Nobel Laureate; Dana and David Dornsife Chair in Chemistry; Member, National Academy of Sciences

I often wonder why it is that people are so averse to astrology. It is the butt of most intellectual jokes, and anyone who discusses it publicly opens themselves up to a hefty load of (albeit usually hilarious) ridicule — yet, simply put, stranger things have happened. 
The most common criticism of astrology is that the time and place of one’s birth alone has almost nothing to do with one’s personality. If we read this charitably, the criticism likely excludes the obvious socio-cultural ramifications of being born at a certain time and place within history and refers to the way astrology uses those measures alone to predict and describe one’s personality and life course. 
This is a mischaracterization of astrology, as it is not so much concerned with the time and place one was born as much as it is with the placements of the planets of our solar system in relation to oneself at birth and then over the course of one’s life. Astrology answers this question: What is the relationship between the huge masses called planets and our own minds and conscious experiences? 
The relationship between physical masses and consciousness that astrology posits raises a philosophical consideration known as the mind-body problem. This is a discussion of the nature of the relationship between the mind and body or, further, the physical and the conscious.  
There are three main conceptions of this relationship. The materialist perspective claims that there is no such thing as a standalone “mind” and that the mind is just an extension of the physical. The idealist perspective claims that there is no such thing as a standalone physical realm — it is just an extension of the mental. Finally, the wide umbrella that is the dualist perspective, which claims that both are real and cannot be absorbed by each other. A subsection of the many dualist perspectives, the interactionist view, posits that the physical and conscious can both causally influence each other. 
An interactionist framework for the mind-body relationship has some scientific backing. Physical states affecting mental states have been well-documented through the study of neurochemistry. There are millions and even billions of chemical reactions occurring in and out of nerve cells responsible for determining our moods and perceptions. 
Mental states affecting physical states have also been well documented, most notably through what has been dubbed “the observer effect” in physics. Briefly, the observer effect is the phenomenon of particles behaving normally when an observer is present but then behaving as waves when the observer is not present. The presence of a consciousness thus seems to alter the physical state of particles. These two facts together suggest that the physical and the mental can both causally influence one another. 
Now, the notion that big things far out in space can influence us here on earth has been documented as well. I’m not going to talk about the moon and the tides and the orbits and everything else you learned in your high school science class, though those are also relevant. I want to visit the specific line in an article published by Syfy.com about what is potentially the biggest black hole observed, created by the merger of two black holes, that inspired this train of thought: 
“On 21 May 2019, [the ripple of gravitational waves caused by the merger of black holes] passed through our planet. Did you feel it? Probably not; the expansion and contraction of space would’ve stretched you less than a millionth of the diameter of a proton.” 
This sentence makes the ongoings of big stuff in space seem a little more personal. We’re not talking about the weather or the tides; we’re talking about you. You were stretched by about a millionth of a proton because of a merger between black holes 17.49 billion light years away. 
How did that stretch of a millionth of a proton on one’s physical body affect one’s mind? There is no obvious answer to that question, but when considering the mind-body problem in an interactionist context, it is hard to say with certainty that this kind of a physical change has no effect on one’s consciousness. 
So if it is hard to confidently say that the result of an event between two massive objects far beyond our solar system had no effect on one’s consciousness, then it should also be hard to confidently conclude that the events occurring between large masses within our own solar system have no effect on our consciousness. Yet today, it is all too easy for most to very confidently conclude that astrology is a total farce. 
A fair question left standing is: How can we be sure that astrological predictions are accurate? We cannot. There is no empirical way as it stands to control for and measure all of the variables that astrology purports to predict, but astrology is more than 2,000 years old. Millenia of tracking the stars, making observations on corresponding personality traits and life courses and then inductively concluding certain assertions of the zodiac based on such observations is not nothing. Astrology is by no means an ironclad field of study, but it is not so unsubstantiated that it is worth calling the whole practice a joke. 
I want to make it clear that I do not believe the practice of astrology to be a science, as it decisively fails the tests of scientific credibility. However, I do feel that the widespread ridicule of the practice as entirely unintellectual is misplaced. I’ll end this article with some food for thought: Might there be any correlation between the undue dismissal of astrology and the fact that it is a predominantly feminine interest?

Surprise, you’re bored out of your mind again. 
I mean, there are a couple books you threw on your counter. You borrowed them back when you told yourself you would “start reading for the purposes of self improvement.” I’ll save you the suspense, you won’t. I guess talking to your parents about politics could also be an option. 
As tempting as these activities sound, I get it. It’s been an exhausting day trying to hide your phone activity from being caught in the webcam display. At the end of it, you just want to kick up your feet and avoid responsibilities for a while, and I totally understand. That’s why I threw together this curated collection of movies, TV shows, barrel-aged classics, unconventional joyrides and piping hot trash, just for you. 
Netflix
“Ratched”
You didn’t pay attention when you read “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” by Ken Kesey in high school, but luckily, it doesn’t take a literary connoisseur to fall head-first into Netflix’s next great hit, “Ratched.” The show delves into the backstory of Nurse Ratched (Sarah Paulson) before she lands her job at the Oregon State Hospital, where the classic ’60s novel was set. In the literary world, Nurse Ratched is regarded as one of the most evil characters ever written. She runs her hospital tyrannically and unabashedly piles on cruel manipulation with a heavy hand. The eerie TV series attempts to explain how Nurse Ratched came to pursue her antagonistic ways while exploring themes of trauma, sexuality and human cognition set in the age of the lobotomy. 
The show itself features stunning, candy-colored scenes so chilling you might want to save it for a treat later in the month. The cinematography is part Wes Anderson film, part pin-up art and part Melanie Martinez music video, which personally, I believe is a hint at Kesey’s participation in the CIA-funded psychedelic experiments and later habitual use of LSD. If that doesn’t perk your curiosity enough to watch the hypnotizing piece, did I mention it features Sarah Paulson? Come on. 
Hulu
“Cowboy Bebop”
On a mission to destroy the restrictions of genre, “Cowboy Bebop” is a critically acclaimed animated neo-noir-meets-space-epic-meets-Macaroni-Western masterpiece. Don’t let yourself get put off: This isn’t your typical animated show. The year is 2071, Earth has become uninhabitable and humanity has moved on to colonize the rest of the solar system. As crime rates soar, bounty hunters (nicknamed “Cowboys”) are contracted to capture criminals. The series is centered around bounty hunter Spike (Steven Blum) and his adventures working from his spaceship, the Bebop. 
The vintage, immersive atmosphere begins from the first note of the opening soundtrack and continues to be a retro-mindgasm: chock-full of Western romantic ennui, East Asian clean-cut minimalism, eccentricity and humanness. The soundtrack is an ingenious cocktail of blues and jazz, the art is absolutely to-die-for, the characters are fleshed out, the storyline is colorful, it is entirely fun but deeply heartfelt — seriously, I cannot recommend this show enough. 
HBO Max:
“Joe Pera Talks With You”
Midterms suck, you don’t see the point in wearing pants anymore and on top of it all, your newest crush won’t give you their number over Zoom private messages. No worries. When life seems heavy, Joe Pera will talk to you. Joe Pera is a fictional version of himself, a soft, introspective, awkward Michiganian choir teacher who just wants to talk. Critics don’t see the point in a show that is all about the mundane, but all it takes is a short 20 minutes to realize why this wildly underrated series scored itself a second season. 
With sweet episode titles like “Joe Pera Takes You to the Grocery Store” and “Joe Pera Talks to You About the Rat Wars of Alberta, Canada (1950–Present Day),” Pera’s soothing voice will quiet those racing thoughts as he drones on about geology, fall drives, beans and breakfast. There’s no better way to put it, Joe Pera is self-care. If worse comes to worst, adorable Joe will certainly put you to sleep more pleasantly than those asynchronous lectures you set at two times speed. 
“Ocean Waves”
If Studio Ghibli made “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away” for the imaginative kid who lives inside all of us, it made “Ocean Waves” for the angsty teen who lives there too. As to be expected from a Ghibli production, this forgotten classic doesn’t disappoint. 
Taku Morisaki (Nobuo Tobita) is a normal junior-high student, working part-time in a restaurant and furious that his school canceled their annual field trip. Rikako Muto (Yoko Sakamoto) is a smart, athletic girl who transfers to his school from the big city and Morisaki’s best friend is in love with her. The story unfolds against a backdrop of serene Japanese countryside and delightful brusqueness. It might be a bit too soon to reminisce on high school, but the soundtrack is airy, the scenery is fresh and the color palette will bring you back to the first time you smelled Dolce&Gabbana Light Blue in a crowded Macy’s. The film overall is careless, naive and undeniably youthful.
Amazon Prime Video
“Masquerade”
As both spooky and election season descend upon us, merge the chaos of politics with a great costume and you get “Masquerade,” a Korean film based on the historical Korean Joseon Era. The film is set in a palace, providing a rich foundation of ancient architecture, clothing, rituals and a whole lot of eunuchs to support a script written to cater to modern-day ideals. When the cold and brutish Emperor (Lee Byung-Hun) is poisoned at the hands of a palace official, a jovial court jester is hauled in to be his replacement. His antics leave lasting impressions that manage to reward him with meaningful friendships along the way. 
The film was inspired by the only Korean emperor to mandate redistributive taxation as a part of national policy, making a striking claim about the true virtues of honor, loyalty and justice. It starts off as a comedy but gradually escalates to become a fast-paced, thrilling drama. By the end of the switcheroo, you will have laughed louder and cried harder than you ever thought possible. A fair warning, this is a film that may leave you hooked on Korean cinema for a while. 
“The Farewell”
“The Farewell” is the most emotionally taxing of all the films in this list and it is an appropriate show-stopper. Awkwafina does a beautiful job playing Billi, a Chinese American girl who travels back to China with her family for a wedding. As it turns out, the wedding is a guise, the family’s last attempt to spend time with Billi’s grandmother before she passes away from cancer. 
The entirety of the film is a “spot the difference” game that treats the consumer to interesting, digestible morsels of Chinese culture and charming glimpses into traditional Chinese approaches to medicine. However, the true heart of the film contrasts the drastic rift between traditional Eastern and Western ideology when it comes to how we approach emotions such as love, grief and ties to family. Neither belief is more right or more wrong, but “The Farewell” helps us acknowledge our differences, enabling us to have an increased aptitude for compassion and understanding across divides.

Students, faculty and staff of the Keck School of Medicine of USC wrote and sent letters to University administration asking for more clarity surrounding USC’s announcement of Laura Mosqueda’s unexpected departure as dean of the school in late August. No official updated announcement has been released from the University. 
In an email sent to the Keck school Aug. 24, Provost Charles Zukoski wrote that Mosqueda was “stepping down” and would “take on a new role spearheading efforts to expand and advance geriatrics at the University.”
Students and faculty were shocked by the announcement, which came seemingly without warning. According to Tobi Fishel, clinical associate professor of pediatrics, members of the school’s faculty were not made aware of Mosqueda’s departure at all before the schoolwide announcement was made. 
Fishel wrote a letter to University administration asking for more information surrounding the former dean’s departure and demanding transparency between leadership and the wider University community. 
“My motivation is really about wanting to support transparency at USC,” Fishel said to the Daily Trojan. “It was important for me to also open dialogue and have communication with leadership about how many people were feeling. I think it’s important in a healthy organization for people to voice both what’s going well and what concerns we might have.” 
Fishel received written responses to her letter from the Academic Senate and the provost. She did not want to disclose the content of her letter because it was “not for publication.” 
“On a personal level, I probably wouldn’t be really satisfied with anything besides Dr. Mosqueda staying because I appreciated and loved her so much,” Fishel said, “but I did appreciate getting a response and opening a dialogue.”
The Social Justice in Medicine Coalition, a student organization at Keck that works to bring together diverse groups of students to promote equity in the medical field, also sent a letter Sept. 8 to University administration asking for an explanation behind Mosqueda’s “firing,” as it is referred to in the letter. The letter was signed by a total of 63 student organizations at Keck.
“The more we talked to the faculty, the more they were just so shocked that this has happened and didn’t really seem to think that it was all her wanting to move somewhere else, but that she was more likely, kind of, fired,” said Madeleine Ing, co-president of the Social Justice in Medicine Coalition. “We just thought it was really important that we publicize the fact of what we knew and what we had learned, that she was fired and [had] not simply left on her own volition.”
Mosqueda was the school’s first female dean, and due to with the lack of information surrounding her dismissal, students demanded further clarification in the letter. Mosqueda assumed the role after the resignation of Rohit Varma, who was accused of sexually harassing a researcher in 2003. Varma succeeded Carmen Puliafito, who used hard drugs before seeing patients. 
“With so little transparency, many of us are concerned that the dismissal was inappropriate and discriminatory — an alarming sign that USC’s leaders are falling into old patterns of behavior,” the letter read. 
The letter has not received a direct response from the USC administration at the time of publication. According to Ing, the only action that happened after the letter’s sending was the release of a video from Zukoski commenting on the former dean’s departure, and that the University was “looking for a greater integration of the academic medical enterprise with the University as a whole.” 
“It didn’t directly acknowledge us at all,” Ing said. “It kind of just reiterated a lot of what he had said in his initial announcement.”
Ing hopes that the letter showed administrators that Keck students want a say in who leads their school, and wants to be included in the decision-making process.
“If they keep saying that they care about what students think and want us to have a say in our education, the idea that they would get rid of a dean who really was here for the students, cared about social justice and had a lot of these tenets that we think are really important shows that they don’t really care about us at all,” Ing said. 
The Academic Senate, which represents the University’s faculty and works to promote the academic integrity of the University, did not respond to the Daily Trojan’s request for comment in time for publication.

For Zackery Torres, sitting down and shutting up was never really an option. 
It probably would have been easier to, Torres admits. To stay in the corner after being misgendered at rehearsal again, to stop correcting friends for using the wrong pronouns, to censor themself as they worried about what other people would think.
Torres, a senior in the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance, came out as gender nonbinary during their sophomore year at USC. Doing so came with a feeling of freedom but also with its own set of challenges. Now, Torres is creating space for others in the dance industry who don’t identify within society’s strict gender binary.
Armed with a pile of frustrated voice memos and a conglomerate of thoughts hastily typed out during breaks in rehearsals, Torres began to compile their experience as a nonbinary dancer. In August, Torres published “An Evolving Conversation on Gender: Dance Edition,”  a guidebook to gender inclusivity for anyone in the dance community. And in July, Torres started Continuum Community, a company which aims to provide practical and easy to implement resources for gender inclusivity.
Torres’ journey with understanding gender identity began at age 13, when they spent two formative years as a cast member on the Lifetime shows “Abby’s Ultimate Dance Competition” and, shortly after, “Dance Moms.” Being in the public eye meant scrutiny from strangers about Torres’ gender identity and sexuality, as well as instructors who emphasized the need to be strong, muscular and traditionally masculine. This is just one of the ways that the gender binary is perpetuated in the dance industry, according to Torres. 
“I started seeing all of the expectations that teachers — well-known dance teachers, and well-known choreographers — had for me as a male dancer growing up and at the time identifying as a boy,” Torres said. “‘Oh, you’re too feminine, you need to dance like a man.’ Just having teachers tell you that on national television, all this stuff, it kind of really got to me.”
Growing up, Torres was eager to put themself in a box, to pick a label and stick with it. While Torres knew that they were attracted to men, being labeled gay “didn’t feel quite right.” Torres wondered, briefly, if they were transgender — but this, too, left them with the feeling that they weren’t embracing their full self. It wasn’t until they came to USC, and realized they were nonbinary, that this feeling subsided.
“Those conversations just weren’t prominent enough in my local communities and in my circles, so I didn’t really have the resources,” they said. “I just kind of shoved it down because I didn’t like the feeling of the unknown.”
For Torres, changing their pronouns was like putting the last piece of a puzzle into place. Torres’ childhood friend Taylor Upsahl said the shift was noticeable from the outside, too. Upsahl has known Torres since they were 10, having attended the same performing arts school in Phoenix, Ariz. Though, according to Upsahl, Torres has always been unapologetically themself, using Torres’ deserved pronouns allowed them to embrace newer facets of themself — things like their style and a newfound confidence in advocating for gender equity.
“I feel like for so long, [Torres] was like ‘I don’t want to be the person in the room that people are annoyed by,” Upsahl said. “But finally, they were like ‘Fuck that, that’s what I was put on this earth to do — to advocate for equality.’ It’s just been so insanely inspiring to see.”
Now, Torres is advocating for gender equity on an even larger scale. Their book, “An Evolving Conversation on Gender: Dance Edition” is the result of years spent in an industry that is centered around — and continues to silently enforce — the gender binary, all while publicly advertising inclusivity. Torres is aiming for a restructuring of the dance community on a day-to-day level, from costuming to rehearsals to the way classes are split up. 
Rehearsals, Torres said, often operate on the assumption that playing a character means having matching gender identities, sexualities or pronouns. Torres isn’t pushing for a change in the canon of traditional roles or choreography but for the use of modified language, so that instructors aren’t forcing the identities of fictional characters onto dancers. 
“Everyone always talks about how inclusive the arts communities are,” Torres said. “But I’m just not really feeling it. I’m not seeing it on an everyday scale.”
Torres’ own work toward rejecting the gender binary in dance started a year and a half ago, when they started advocating for further gender inclusivity within Kaufman. Torres acted as a sort of liaison between professors and students in discussions centered around the role gender plays in dance, especially the way rehearsals and classes are run. Kaufman professor Bruce McCormick, who met Torres during their sophomore year, was one of these professors. Calling Torres a “generous thought partner,” McCormick believes that Torres’ advocacy has been central to creating a more inclusive environment at Kaufman. 
“[Torres] embracing their gender identity has been beautiful to witness,” McCormick said. “They have allowed themself to be vulnerable, with faculty and fellow students, in order to push this conversation forward and educate everyone around them.”
It seemed to Torres that their push for inclusivity had enough forward momentum to make tangible change, including a goal of de-gendering ballet classes. But when the Kaufman schedule was published for the fall semester of 2019, ballet classes were still divided into men and women. Torres began writing “An Evolving Conversation on Gender” shortly after.
“That’s when I started really putting my foot down, really hitting the gas pedal and driving right through all of it,” Torres said. “We kind of got comfortable and then change stopped happening.”
Since then, forward progress has been made. Ballet classes are now split based on the footwork and steps dancers are working on, rather than into binary genders. In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Kaufman’s Assistant Dean of Faculty Jackie Kopcsak emphasized the school’s support for Torres’ advocacy. 
“As part of our strategic planning process, USC Kaufman established affirmations — valued commitments which guide our decisions. Belonging, the embrace of individuality, inclusion and equity, was one of them,” Kopcsak wrote. “Categorizing ballet class by dance skill rather than gender was a decision that spoke to this value, and we commend Zack for advocating for this important change.”
Ultimately, Torres is grateful that Kaufman has been responsive to their push for inclusivity, believing that the school and its faculty want to grow and develop. But Torres isn’t planning on slowing down anytime soon.
“I want to stay on the edge of my seat, I want to keep challenging myself,” Torres said. “I don’t ever want to sit and be comfortable.”

How does prison labor tie into college athletes’ rights to be paid? 
Writing this column, I’m still wrapping my mind around it. I picture a team of lawyers huddled in a courtroom rummaging through hundreds of precedents the NCAA has already set — and somehow, these suits pull out a prison labor case as the key for dismissing another student-athlete suit for fair compensation. 
In 2018, a former Villanovafootball player named Lawrence Livers sued the NCAA, arguing that he was employed both by the association and his university as soon as he stepped foot on the field wearing the Commodore jersey, and that the NCAA’s refusal to compensate was in violation of the minimum wage provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
The NCAA hired the San Francisco-based Constangy, Brooks, Smith & Prophete firm to handle the dismissal. What it pulled out for precedent was a 1992 decision in Vanskike v. Peters, where the Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals cited the 13th Amendment in denying the defendant minimum wage for his work done in prison. Several months later, the judge rejected the NCAA’s motion to dismiss, but the message was already sent: the association will stoop to label its athletes as prison laborers to avoid paying them.  
Let’s digress for a moment. Last time, we talked about how the NCAA coined the term “student-athlete” to establish amateurism as a defense against compensation in the 20th century. Countless appeals and a billion-dollar empire later, the association now shoots for the Hail Mary of the slave labor amendment.
In Livers’s rebuttal to the NCAA’s dismissal motion, his lawyers noted how forced the legalistic confection was, but also how college athletes should be alarmed by what their governing body implies in its legal application. Using a 13th Amendment case means the association referred to its defendant as the loophole in the use of slave labor.
Lawyers’ jobs revolve around rhetoric. They must have known the implication of using Vanskike vs. Peters while representing an organization run on the backs of thousands of Black student-athletes. 
The thing is: This isn’t the first time the case has shown up in an NCAA defense. In 2016, the NCAA cited the case in Berger vs. NCAA to defend against the claim that student-athletes are employees. Even after public outrage over the association’s use of the precedent in 2018, they cited it again in 2019 under a new set of lawyers in Dawson v. NCAA dismissing an athlete’s claim to minimum wage and overtime pay. This means the implication of student-athletes as prison or loophole slave labor is a defense from the association itself — not just a backhanded attempt by lawyers to win for a client.
You could argue that this is evidence of an empire’s legal defense falling apart as the call for fair compensation becomes undeniable. I see that, but I argue this is getting at a much deeper issue within the association: its role in the country’s exploitation of Black people’s labor.
Activists have taken on the rhetoric of slave labor to focus on the lack of control Black student-athletes have in their lives. Even if athletes are playing their sport of choice on scholarship at the ultimate school of their choice, the analogy has exploded in the compensation discussion because it gets at the root of the problem of giving power and control of a person’s own labor to an outside entity. 
In a March 2014 essay titled “End the NCAA’s Plantation Economics,” civil rights icon Jesse Jackson directly draws a link between slave labor and the current structure of the NCAA. 
“Everyone gets paid in big-time college athletics except the players who actually risk their bodies to provide the show,” Jackson wrote.
The NCAA winces when directly addressed with this analogy — which carries hundreds of years of historical weight — but it really doesn’t have the grounds to do so. 
It is impossible to baulk at activists fighting for just compensation using historical slave labor rhetoric when the NCAA itself uses the legal loophole that allows mass unpaid labor to exist in this country. If the association wants to use the definition in its defense, it is fortifying itself as a racist structure. 
The prison labor justification for denying minimum wage to a voluntary athlete doesn’t make sense in a legal context, or even a common sense context.
