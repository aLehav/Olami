“This is exactly like my family!” one woman exclaimed during the first of two intermissions.
Hopefully, she didn’t mean “exactly.” If she did, she should not — under any circumstances whatsoever — be smiling, and should instead be safely at therapy.

Such is the dysfunctional family at the heart of Tracy Letts’ Tony Award–winning drama August: Osage County, now playing at the Ahmanson Theatre until Oct. 18.
In the space of a little more than three hours — which amount to but to a few blinks of the eye — August: Osage County gets the audience to laugh loudly, cry quietly, gasp with shock, recoil with disgust and ultimately jump to its feet in rapturous, greatly deserved applause.
Once the play has you, it never lets go — it sweeps you up as if you are in the tempestuous tornado of high drama, which leaves massive wreckage in its proverbial wake. Nothing is safe. Everything is at stake.
The play is set in motion by the mysterious disappearance of Beverly Weston (Jon Devries), the alcoholic head of the Weston household. He leaves behind his old wife, Violet “I am a drug addict!” Weston (Estelle Parsons), and the recently hired help, an Indian woman named Johnna Monevata (DeLanna Studi).
Violet calls her daughter Ivy (Angelica Torn), who calls her sister Barbara (Shannon Cochran), who shows up with her husband Bill (Jeff Still) and 14-year-old daughter Jean (Emily Kinney). Pretty soon, the world’s most dysfunctional family is sweetly — well, not so sweetly — together again.
Complications that might figure one per season in a standard soap opera are all here, in one glorious super-soap of a show: addiction, suicide, adultery (more than once), rape, pedophilia and incest. At once hilarious and horrifying, the plights that befall this family should make most of us mighty thankful for our relative normalcy.
Except most of us can easily relate. Though our families may not be “exactly” like the Westons, somehow we know exactly what they’re going through. Requisite scenes such as the family dinner party — Violet letting off a delicious stream of invective insults against the world, Barbara losing her mind — speak to something universal. Therein lies the show’s genius: making extraordinary situations feel strangely ordinary.
Parsons’s Violet, a matriarchal monstrosity seemingly hell-bent on self-alienation, carries the entire show. She is scarily convincing, portraying a drug-addled, partially brain-damaged old woman to perfection. On her shoulders rests the fate of the Weston family, and it is all she can do not to buckle under the weight.
There to pick Violet up as she slams her right back down is Barbara — no doubt the strongest of the three Weston sisters. Cochran, whose deep voice lends a much-needed world-weariness to the difficult role, gives a performance to rival Parsons’s in effectiveness.
Her two sisters — Ivy and Karen (Amy Warren) — have slightly less meaty roles, but clearly make their presence known. Ivy, who falls in love with her first cousin Charles (a tenderly awkward Stephen Riley Key), imbues her character with a kind of otherness which at first feels forced but eventually makes perfect sense. Karen is the insufferable giggler of the group, acting determinedly optimistic and milking the role for some of the best laughs of the night. Demons prey on the minds of all the Weston sisters, and it is a testament to their acting that the audience sees those demons lurking behind every forced smile, every downward glance.
There isn’t a single weak link in the 13-member ensemble. A distinctive standout is Kinney’s pot-smoking, movie-obsessed Jean. A young actress, Kinney could easily have been overshadowed by her much more experienced castmates, yet she acts with remarkable maturity and never once suffers by comparison.
The sole criticism of the production is no fault of the actors. For some reason, the Ahmanson can’t ever seem to get a firm handle on sound, and  the microphones are invariably one notch too quiet (Richard Woodbury did sound design for August, but other shows have suffered similarly). In a show like this, where every line is exquisitely written (Letts won the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for Drama), missing even a single word can be a real tragedy.
Todd Rosenthal’s original scenic design — an elegantly multi-storied house, gorgeously lit by Ann G. Wrightson (who does wonderful work with transitional scenes complemented by Anna D. Shapiro’s clever direction) — haunts the mind a good while after the curtains close. It is claustrophobic, and it is confining. Violet Weston does not believe in air conditioning — as if it’s something, her husband observes, to disbelieve — and we can nearly feel what it might be like to step into that doorway and be greeted not by a gust of cool air but by an onslaught of unbearable heat.
By the show’s end, exhaustion sets in — emotional, mental and even physical. But it’s still not enough to keep the audience from giving this production — no doubt one of the best in recent years — a booming standing ovation.

“This has to be the greatest collection of underground music ever assembled!”
The crowd exploded in agreement as Wayne Coyne, lead singer of the wildly popular rock band the Flaming Lips, beamed from the stage of the Stardust Room at Kutsher’s Hotel and Country Club in Monticello, NY.

This was the shared feeling among attendees and performers on the final night of 2009’s All Tomorrow’s Parties NY — a three-day, limited-admission indoor music festival in upstate New York that took place this past weekend.
Unlike any festival of its kind — save for the eponymous British collection of festivals from which the American version was spawned — ATP brings together music lovers for a weekend of intimate concerts and activities with an attendance rate capped out at just under 2,000.
Now in its second year at the Kutsher’s compound — last year’s inaugural event, which was curated by shoegaze pioneers My Bloody Valentine, drew rave reviews — ATP continually breaks the mold set by most contemporary music festivals.
Oddly enough, the weekend harkens back to the pioneer days of the festival circuit set by events such as Woodstock, which took place only several miles away from the Kutsher’s site.
There are no corporate sponsors; you will never see a band at ATP playing the Vitamin Water stage, you will find no Verizon Wireless VIP tent and there are no advertisements proclaiming that the weekend was made possible by Budweiser.
Rather, ATP functions as an autonomous machine, with revenue generated by the event’s established name as a British music promoter. As such, ATP feels communal and significant in its own right.
“It still feels strange to be playing something like this so far from home,” mused Randy Randall, guitarist of Los Angeles noise-punk duo No Age. “The people who stayed behind in LA don’t know what they missed.”
In a time when most music festivals cater to a younger clientele by filling lineups with buzz bands and chart-toppers, ATP goes against the norm by hand selecting performers that possess an appeal generally unseen by mainstream acts.
As a result, the festival attracts music lovers spanning several decades in age — there are no drugged-out hippies simply looking to party or 12-year-olds hoping for a glimpse of MGMT here.
Kutsher’s in itself seems the unlikely place for a music festival. Once a hotbed of the famed Borscht Belt strip of predominantly Jewish summer resorts in the Catskills, the compound — as well as the surrounding community of Monticello — now sits in various states of disrepair, a tangible testament to the country’s ever-fluctuating economic climate.
Throughout the weekend, attendees continually remarked that Kutsher’s felt like a haunted resort; a wrong turn down some deserted hallway and the getaway could seemingly turn into a scene from The Shining. One audience member even remarked that the flamboyant pink wallpaper and cheesy paintings in his suite reminded him of his Jewish grandmother’s house.
“Honestly,” Randall mused as he gestured sadly to the worn and dated décor of his band’s Kutsher hotel suite. “Just look at this place.”
The residents of the areas surrounding Kutsher’s have grown to appreciate the impact of the festival upon their mountain communities. Asking my friend if she was in town for the festival, the cashier at the local Wal-Mart remarked that ATP was “the only thing [Monticello] has anymore.”
While many music events bring noise complaints from neighbors and worries of the “wrong” crowd descending upon a secluded area, ATP and Monticello have developed a symbiosis of sorts; now, it appears Kutsher’s may be saved from demolition by the revenue brought in from ATP alone.
For all its wonderful perfections, All Tomorrow’s Parties had its fair share of pitfalls: the smaller of the two stages experienced terrible reverberations from the room’s back wall all weekend; a member of the band Black Moth Super Rainbow’s entourage accidentally shattered a chandelier when he tossed a water bottle into the crowd, sending glass shards flying and injuring several audience members; Kutsher’s three ATMs ran out of money daily as patrons gleefully purchased cash-only concessions and drinks.
Aside from ATP’s technical faults that befall all music-related events, the lineup — and even the small group of festival-goers — seemed to lack a certain diversity. I should have taken heed, however, as several female repeat attendees warned me that ATP tends to be, for lack of a better phrase, “a sausage fest.”
“It’s a bit upsetting,” said Crystal Castles’ frontwoman Alice Glass before a performance by the Athens, Ga.-based pop group Circulatory System — one of the few groups with two females among its ranks. “That’s the only thing about [All Tomorrow’s Parties] this year I haven’t liked.”
Female performers peppering the lineup during the three days could be counted on both hands, and female-led bands were an even rarer sight: the 14-piece orchestral pop group, Caribou Vibration Ensemble, brought no female musicians to the festival, and the only women onstage with the Flaming Lips were scantily clad dancers made to look like go-go-dancing bear/cat hybrids.
Musical sexism aside, ATP’s unique conglomeration of multiple musical generations manifested itself as a part of No Age’s Sunday night performance when Randall and No Age drummer Dean Spunt shared their set with Bob Mould, frontman of the legendary punk group Hüsker Dü.
As Randall, Spunt and Mould blazed through some of Hüsker Dü’s greatest songs — in addition to several No Age songs, as well as a Ramones cover of “Chinese Rock” featuring Deerhunter frontman Bradford Cox — it suddenly became clear that All Tomorrow’s Parties is truly an irreplaceable gem of the music festival world.
All Tomorrow’s Parties really has something special on its hands. The sheer lack of pretension, the intimacy, the strangeness, the magic and the seclusion — nothing like this could happen at any other festival in any other part of the world.
I am certain I was not alone in this sentiment as everyone flooded out of Kutsher’s Monday morning to head back home, already speaking about their plans to return the following year.
The Flaming Lips aren’t British like your photo caption says. They are from Oklahoma. Otherwise great fest review.

Sunday night, I was happily procrastinating in front of my computer. An oral presentation due Monday, hundreds of pages of reading and a new episode of Glee all sat in my lap, chaotic and demanding — but my eyes were right on an open, even more commanding presence: Facebook.
There I was, buried in the shame of an unproductive night when suddenly a string of notifications began to appear on my mini-feed — the same words repeated over and over, echoed by friends too distant to have shared a personal bonding experience. Taylor Swift. Kanye West. A list of expletives I would be censored for using.
Now, everyone and their brother knows that I’m no fan of Taylor Swift. A sweet girl? Yes. Someone I would want to share brunch with? Possibly. Talented? Not so much. But regardless of any opinions I might have had on my favorite female music video of the year (not hers, not by a long shot), she deserved a night of praise, well wishes and adoring, screaming fans. She deserved a speech and applause and a moment to be the modest, humble and beautiful girl she is. She definitely did not deserve, however, someone stealing  her microphone and dismissing her glory in front of millions.
It’s funny, the ways in which children demand attention and do horrible things to obtain it. When I was two and my parents had another child, I used to push my sister away and sleep in her crib so that they would bestow the same baby talk and googly eyes upon me. I know of kids who bullied and misbehaved, who painted on walls and imagined monsters in their closets, who told lies, feinted illnesses or unleashed pain in order to secure their few moments in the spotlight. Funnier still were the justifications sometimes used to explain away these behaviors — when a boy pushed me off the monkey bars and broke my arm in the second grade, it was because he had a crush on me. True story.
What’s funniest are the ways in which people refuse to let go of these childish antics, even when they leave adolescence behind like a shed, forgotten skin. Every female I have ever met knows how, either in extreme situations or in everyday life, to utilize passive aggressiveness, the silent treatment and face-to-face confrontation. These were all persuasive, adaptive measures learned in the wild, concrete jungle of elementary school to ensure attention.
What is hazing (oh, um, I mean a brotherhood’s attempts to civilly embrace new kin) if not double-dog dares gone horribly wrong? Lots of my friends drink alcohol like I used to bathe myself in chocolate milk. I have seen office memos and emails infused with high school’s social hierarchy, lab groups drafted like recess dodgeball teams and text messages sent like those flimsy pieces of papers you would sometimes find in your locker after third period: Do you like me? Check yes or no.
I want to say that we have all grown up. To a certain extent, we all have — but many times, when it comes to demanding attention, people still rely on childish maneuvers. The boy who sits in the back of class and raises his hand, only to ask silly questions and immediately high five his adjacent bro. The senator who screams “You lie!” as Obama addresses the nation. The professor who will embarrass you in class because you once pointed out a mistake he made during lecture. West, a man who felt the need to put down a sweet-hearted girl in order to hear his voice echoing across the Internet.
But you know, maybe I’ve got it all wrong. Maybe this is West speaking his heart, professing his love to Swift in the way that only prepubescent boys can. “Boo, you suck” equals “I love you.” Don’t you know, Kanye, that all you have to do is make your way through the crowd and say “hello?”

Beneath the dim glow of pale colored lights, five actors took to the black-paneled floor in the Scene Dock Theatre Sunday. Dressed conservatively in dark attire from head to toe, they nearly blended in with the theater’s unassuming backdrop — a curtain as black as the floor, pulled tightly across the length of the stage.
The five actors sat in identical black chairs neatly placed against the curtain, black-bound books in hand. When the scene called for their respective character, each actor approached one of the five black music stands evenly spaced from stage left to stage right. There, they read, their eyes glancing from the pages of the book to one another to the audience, miming small actions yet never taking more than a step or two away from their  music stands.
Two generations · Emily Kuroda (right) and Tess Lina play mother and daughter, respectively, in Calligraphy: Fading Ink, Fading Memories. - Ben Rolnik | Daily Trojan
The color black is not a metaphor in esteemed playwright and USC School of Theatre professor Velina Hasu Houston’s newest work, Calligraphy: Fading Ink, Fading Memories, nor is the production’s simple decor the way Houston envisioned the play. Rather, the modest event that occurred in the tucked-away theater Sunday was a staged reading open to the public — just one of the many steps in transforming the characters and dialogue floating around in a playwright’s mind to a living, breathing stage production.
“You have to dream the play in your mind, but it definitely becomes a work in process that you have to shape along the way,” said Calligraphy’s dramaturge Luis Alfaro before the reading began. “Right now, we’re in the middle of the process.”
It has been quite the process for Houston, Alfaro and director Jon Lawrence Rivera, who together have cut the play from more than two and a half hours to its current runtime of 90 minutes.
“There’s an urge to cut [material] just for the sake of cutting,” Houston said. “But it’s not simple surgery; it’s not about cutting chunks, but about cutting and replacing. It’s almost like you have all these kinds of arteries — different lives that you’re trying to weave together.”
This threading of intriguing characters — each possessing a boatload’s worth of emotional baggage and backstory — as well as humor and drama is the core of Calligraphy.
The play depicts the fragile relationships between a Japanese family separated not only by the vast Pacific Ocean, but also by jealousy, discrimination and betrayal. Sisters Noriko (Emily Kuroda, most notable for her role as Mrs. Kim on Gilmore Girls) and Natsuko (Drama Desk-nominated actress Natsuko Ohama) have not spoken to one another since Noriko married a black U.S. Army soldier whom she met during World War II. Following the death of Noriko’s husband nearly 50 years later, both sisters are haunted by their unsettling pasts — yet they both refuse to find closure with one another.
As Noriko and Natsuko constantly avoid confronting their histories, Houston intertwines the complicated lives of their two daughters, Hiromi (Tess Lina) and Sayuri (Tamlyn Tomita), who are attempting to not only reunite their mothers but also to cope with the inevitable — their mothers’ failing health.
“In my own family, I was confronted with my mother suffering from a brain disease with similar symptoms to Alzheimer’s,” Houston said. “It was a shocking transition for me to realize that the woman who once cared for everyone now needed care herself.”
Houston also uses the two cousins — Hiromi and Sayuri — to represent how Japanese culture is conforming to the Western world and the difficulties resulting from this culture clash.
“As much as you try to be modern, certain ideas are stuck in your DNA that you a become a slave to,” Houston explained. “You try to shake off certain ideas entrenched in your mother’s era, but it always creeps up on you and you end up saying, ‘Oh, I sound just like my mother.’”
Though Houston admitted that she was jotting down notes throughout the performance on scenes and dialogue on which she could improve, the audience responded to the work-in-progress production warmly. Hearty laughs filled the intimate theater in nearly every scene, while heavy sighs and whimpers of concerned could be heard during the play’s more somber moments.
The audience’s consistent sincerity could only mean one thing — that even in Calligraphy’s early stages, Houston has touched upon a human experience that truly resonates with a great number of people, no matter what race or age.
“I always wanted to bring [my work] back to a personal story,” Houston said. “Here, it’s the moment you realize your mother is not trying to annoy you with constant nagging, but because she doesn’t remember asking you 10 times before.”
In the first scene of Calligraphy, Noriko explains to her daughter  “Japanese people love in a different way.” But stripped bare of costumes, props and lavish designs, Houston’s newest work proves that familial bonds are one of the most significant aspects of the human condition.

A delectable cross between Yogurtland and Cold Stone, the new 21 Choices Frozen Yogurt is the perfect cure for the distracting mid-homework cravings that USC students often suffer.
More than two years after the Undergraduate Student Government promised to bring 21 Choices to campus, the frozen yogurt shop, which is owned by USC alumnus Gudu Husson and his brother Tony, has finally opened its doors in the University Village to students and community members.
Decisions, decisions · 21 Choices, which opened its University Village location in August, first made a name for itself in Pasadena. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
Intrigued by the new dessert shop, students — who seem to have a very special bond with frozen yogurt — are often lined up out the door.
“The best message was not that we opened, but that people wanted us there,” Husson said. “It’s just icing on the cake that it happens to be at my alma mater.”
According to Husson, his involvement in the entrepreneurship program at USC’s Marshall School of Business as an undergraduate provided much of his inspiration for starting 21 Choices, which has three other locations in Claremont and Pasadena, the first of which opened in 1989.
“It’s the professors who really make or break the deal,” he said. “Some people can really turn you off from what you want to do or they can enhance your love for what you want to do.”
For Husson, it was the latter, combined with a desire to create a truly delicious product that he and his brother — who are both lactose intolerant — could eat, that sparked the creation of 21 Choices. Named for the carefully selected 21 ingredients that the brothers limit themselves to in making the frozen yogurt, the shops feature solely organic ingredients which make their yogurt healthier than most sweet-tooth fulfilling alternatives.
“The organic thing is overused now, but it’s what we’ve believed in for 20 years, before it was in,” Husson said.
While all of the ingredients used in 21 Choices’ yogurts are still organic, there are many more than just 21.
“Now we have a lot more ingredients because society in general is starting to be more health-conscious, but not so boring, so we can provide the fun, the excitement, and still have the really healthy goodness of organic fruit, or Valrhona chocolate imported from France,” Husson said. “Those kinds of ingredients simply were not available back then.”
With more than 400 yogurt choices that 21 Choices’ yogurt chefs can make, there is no doubt that students will make the new dessert shop a regular stop in an attempt to try them all. Each day, five or six choices are featured, ranging from the more common French vanilla to the more unique chocolate peppermint schnapps. If you are having a hard time deciding which kind to purchase, not to worry — the cheerful employees pass out free samples of each while you wait in line.
If none of the yogurt choices strike your fancy, you can propose suggestions for new flavors, which is one of Husson’s favorite parts about having his shop so close to a college campus.
“These college kids are really creative,” he said. “They come up with these great ideas for yogurt choices and ingredients and the yogurt chef can make them into a reality 90 percent of the time.”
Beyond the yogurt choices lies a world of mix-ins, including strawberries, bananas, Reese’s peanut butter cups, graham crackers, sprinkles, gummy worms, gummy bears, cookie dough, Twinkies, HoHos and Ding Dongs — just to name a few.  The transparent, futuristic-looking plastic bins that house the fun-filled mix-ins make you feel as if you have just walked into a candy store.
“Sometimes people just want to be decadent for a day and we encourage that,” Husson said. “If someone wants to get Ding Dongs with their Valrhona chocolate yogurt, go ahead and do it.”
The only downside: Each mix-in costs an additional 95 cents, on top of the $3.30 or more that a serving of yogurt alone costs.
“I got peach with nothing else because each mix-in is almost a dollar extra,” said Kim Chan, a junior majoring in business administration. “It’s really expensive, but I guess that’s the price you pay for having it so close to campus in such a convenient location.”
Although devouring the frozen yogurt comes in as a close second, the best part of the 21 Choices experience is being asked by the employee who mixes the frozen yogurt to take a bite and tell her if you like it. If you don’t like it, she will start all over.
“Just because you ask for something to be made, doesn’t mean you have to buy it,” Husson said. “That’s so anti-friendly, so anti-business. Our value system does not allow that.”
The brothers’ clear set of values and outstanding customer service reflect on their excitement about bringing 21 Choices to the USC area — a sentiment that’s undeniably reciprocated by USC students. With mutual excitement this strong — and healthy frozen yogurt that tastes this good — the new 21 Choices is sure to become a long-standing staple in the USC community.

The husband and wife charged in the hit-and-run that killed a USC student and injured another will stand trial, a judge said Tuesday at the conclusion of the preliminary hearing that began Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court.
Claudia Cabrera, 30, and her husband Josue Luna, 33, will face trial at the end of the month. Cabrera was allegedly driving the car that struck and killed USC freshman Adrianna Bachan and left freshman Marcus Garfinkle in critical condition.
Prosecutors say Luna, the passenger pulled Garfinkle from the windshield and left him on the side of the road before getting back in the car and fleeing the scene.
Garfinkle testified at the hearing that he briefly saw the man who pulled him off the windshield before the car drove away.
“I wake up on the side of the road,” Garfinkle told the judge. “I see a man hop in a car and I stare at the license plate, but it immediately fades from my memory … It sped off quickly.”
Cabrera is charged with one felony count of leaving the scene of an accident and one misdemeanor count of vehicular manslaughter. Luna is charged with a felony count of leaving the scene of an accident.
“It’s apparent they did nothing to render aid,” said Judge Mary Lou Villar, commenting on evidence presented during the preliminary hearing. “They left the scene.”
Garfinkle, who is back at USC after undergoing three surgeries and spending more than a month in the hospital, said though he was pleased with Villar’s decision, he had mixed feelings about the hearing overall.
“I’m happy that it looks like more justice will be served,” Garfinkle said.
He added, however, that testifying was an emotional experience.
“I went to court for the first time last Friday to testify and, emotionally, it was tough for me,” he said. “I saw these two people for the first time face to face. I’ve never been to court before and it was a very, very draining process.”
Garfinkle described the atmosphere of the courtroom as a combination of “uncertainty, frustration and hope.”
Reliving the experience as he testified brought up feelings of “extreme sadness,” Garfinkle said, adding that he remains extremely appreciative for his life.
Garfinkle said he had not intended to testify, but he was subpoenaed the day before the preliminary hearing began.
Garfinkle gave his testimony in front of a courtroom filled with his and Bachan’s friends and family members.
“It was beautiful to have all the positive energy in the room fighting such a bad circumstance,” Garfinkle said. “I felt like there were so many people on our side.”
Friday was also the first time Garfinkle met Bachan’s family.
“It was emotional, it was satisfying to meet them,” he said. “It was nice to finally connect with them.”
Garfinkle will testify again at the trial, an experience he expects to be just as emotionally straining. He said, however, he is willing to do what it takes to see that justice is served.
“My main goal is to get justice for Adrianna,” Garfinkle said.
Cabrera and Luna are due back in court Sept. 29 for the trial.
Cabrera was arrested April 2 as the result of a tip that came after $235,000 in reward money was announced. Luna was arrested April 18 coming back into the United States from Mexico.
The two are being held on $1 million bail each.

Rarely do Tchaikovsky and Twitter go together.
But KUSC 91.5 FM — USC’s classical radio station and the country’s most listened to public radio station — is hoping to change that by working with the Integrated Media Systems Center to combine classical music with new media.
 On air · Alan Chapman, a host for KUSC, sits behind the control booth at the LA studio. KUSC is the most listened to public radio station. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan
KUSC and IMSC, a research facility focused on new media based in the Viterbi School of Engineering, will be letting students shape the future of music with a venture called the Music X Project.
“The X means different things to different people; it’s a funny title,” said James Baker, director of IMSC. “I’m a mathematician, so to me X means ‘unknown.’ To Robert Cutietta, who’s dean of the School of Music, it means ‘Generation X.’”
Through the Music X project, students will be able to submit proposals for multimedia projects that bring classical music to the digital age, and the best ideas from these proposals will be developed.
“All music is becoming more accessible because of new media,” said Brenda Barnes, president of KUSC. “What we wanted to do with IMSC is to see how they might help us translate what we do more effectively into the new media world.”
Barnes approached Baker over the summer wanting to find ways to move KUSC into the new media realm.
“We need to be online because there are things we can do online that we can’t do on the radio,” Barnes said. “On the radio, all we can offer is one programming stream. Online we can offer multiple classical music channels — we could have a channel that’s all Mozart, that’s all opera, a study mix for people who want to listen to classical music while they’re studying.”
Baker said he predicts the convergence of radio and Internet, and he was excited to be involved with KUSC’s endeavor.
“This was one of the most interesting projects that had come my way,” he said. “There’s going to be a major change in the system coming in the future. We’re going to have an opportunity to influence that … We have a technical approach to go about it, at least to get started, and there’s no clear answer to where we are or where we should be going — and this is what really intrigued me.”
The program Barnes and Baker decided on was the Music X Project, which will let students drive KUSC’s emergence into new media.
“Where did we get the big software we use today on our personal computers?” Baker said. “We got that from a kid who was a freshman in college — Bill Gates. [New technology] comes by young people who get some really out-of-the-box ideas.”
In early October, students will be able to submit essays on their ideas for the future of music and technology. The best essays will receive a cash prize and the best ideas will receive a stipend; Baker expects to eventually develop six stipend-based projects.
For Barnes, the Music X project is about putting KUSC at the forefront of the radio and new media marriage movement, and not about saving classical music.
“Classical music has withstood the test of time,” Barnes said. “It’s been around for hundreds of years and yet it’s still popular and still relevant for people. I think that classical music and the arts remind us of the wonderful things human beings are capable of … We need to be online because there are things we can do online that we can’t do on the radio.”
Thornton Dean Robert Cutietta, agreed that classical music does not need saving. He noted, however, that integrating new media will bring classical music to new generations.
“The distribution and recording of music have changed so much in the last 10 years, it’s going to be a critical part of how we go forward as musicians, and how we reach our audiences,” Cutietta said.
Baker considers holding on to culture a critical aspect of new technology, which makes classical music, the hub of musical culture, a necessary base.
“If we lose our aspirations of looking at great art, whether it’s music, film, visual arts or architecture, I think we’ve lost an important part of what it means to be human,” Cutietta said.

Even after extending its application deadline, the Viterbi Student Council’s Executive Board received only one application, causing the council to become inactive for this school year.
The VSC is an umbrella organization that coordinates monthly meetings between the presidents and board members of various Viterbi organizations and the Viterbi administration.
Paul Ledesma, associate director of undergraduate admissions for Viterbi and last year’s VSC faculty adviser, said he was not sure why there was so little interest in the VSC Executive Board this year.
It is the responsibility of the outgoing Executive Board to organize and publicize elections, Ledesma said.
“It’s possible that it wasn’t advertised adequately by last year’s leadership, but it’s also possible that students who may have run for the position found it more important to hold leadership positions within their specific engineering student organizations,” Ledesma wrote in an email.
William Wu, last year’s VSC vice chair, said the organization had slowly moved away from its original role as a resource for students.
“I think [VSC] is becoming obsolete because [organizations] were just going to it for money instead of using it as a resource and building a relationship with the administration,” Wu said. “It could have a big impact and could really make engineering present at USC. Right now, I don’t think there’s a need for it. Maybe there’s not a want for it.”
Internal issues might also have played a role in this year’s suspension of the Executive Board, according to Wu.
“The Board had its own separate communication issues to deal with [and] VSC also had to learn how to adapt to the regulations set by the administration, which previous Board members thought was always challenging,” Wu said.
Wu noted that he doesn’t think an overarching committee is necessary.
Traditionally, the VSC treasurer oversees the VSC Funding Board, which is responsible for allocating funds to various Viterbi clubs. This year, the Funding Board will continue to function as a separate entity despite the lack of a VSC Executive Board.
“The Funding Board is operating as it always did,” Ledesma wrote. “With the exception of a few procedural changes and an updated, streamlined application, there are no changes to the Funding Board’s operation.”
In fact, some club presidents feel that a separate funding board is more efficient than the funding board that was part of VSC in previous years.
“The only change that has been made is pretty positive. They streamlined the [funding application] procedure,” said Lynn Ho, president of the Society of Women Engineers. “There’s only one form to actually get the money. Before, you would apply and it was harder.”
The new funding board is also functioning well without a VSC Executive Board, according to those involved.
“I’m kind of the person who is communicating between the [administration] and the student organizations right now, since there’s no VSC,” said Ken Diedrich, director of the Funding Board.
Ledesma said the transition to a separate funding board has been a smooth one.
“Ken made sure to inform student organization leadership of the change and reassure them the funding sources would remain unchanged at our first event of the year,” Ledesma wrote.
After speaking with the leaders of various Viterbi organizations, Ledesma said he believes these groups will be unaffected by the lack of a VSC Executive Board.
It has yet to be determined whether or not VSC will be active next year, but it will largely be based on student interest, Ledesma added.
He wrote, “If students want to get VSC back up and running, I look forward to working with them,” he wrote.

Freshman quarterback Matt Barkley continued to sit out of throwing drills at practice Tuesday, leading to increased speculation that redshirt sophomore Aaron Corp will get the nod to start at Washington this Saturday.
Barkley, ailing from a bruised right shoulder, said after practice that he tried to throw but couldn’t continue because of pain.
Tables turned · Aaron Corp may be in line to start this week. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
Corp, recovering from a cracked left fibula himself, took nearly all of the first-team snaps in his place.
“I’m ready,” Corp said after practice Tuesday. “I was ready last week, I was ready two weeks ago, so I’ll be ready. If they need me, then I feel pretty good.”
Corp estimated he was 95 percent recovered from the leg injury he suffered on Aug. 10. This week marks the first time he’s acted as the first-team quarterback since.
“I definitely feel like the starter when I’m in there taking first-team reps, at least pretending to be,” Corp said. “If I can keep playing well and give our team a chance to get better, then that’s all I can do.”
Senior cornerback Josh Pinkard jumped in front of redshirt sophomore wide receiver Brandon Carswell to intercept Corp’s first throw of the team-period play, but Corp rebounded with a spot-on deep ball to redshirt junior receiver Damian Williams on the next play.
“[Corp] had a good day today and we made note of it,” coach Pete Carroll said. “Fortunately, we have a tremendous alternative at the quarterback spot and we know Aaron can play. We don’t have any question about it at all.”
Barkley completed 15-of-31 passes for 195 yards against Ohio State on Saturday in just his second collegiate start. He suffered the injury in the third quarter and said Tuesday that it “hurt like hell” for the duration of the game.
“I’m taking mental reps and I’m learning the game plan like it’s a normal week,” Barkley said. “I personally think I could play without any practice, but I don’t know how well that would sound.”
Carroll said Barkley’s status is still day-to-day, adding that a decision will be made later on this week.
Corp said he would be disappointed if he didn’t start Saturday.

Senior safety Taylor Mays sat out of practice completely, spending the majority of the practice icing his sprained right knee on the sidelines.
Still, his prognosis looks positive.
“I feel better than yesterday and better than Sunday, so by Saturday it should feel great,” Mays said.
If Mays can’t play, Carroll said sophomore Drew McAllister would fill in. McAllister practiced Tuesday and produced encouraging results after missing practice last week with a sore hip.

After last year’s 35-3 trouncing of Ohio State, the Trojans suffered their only loss to underdog Oregon State.
That has some speculating that this Saturday will be this year’s version.
“If you were to draw up a trap game, I think that this would be the one,” Williams said. “It was the same thing last year. We were coming off a big game and played Oregon State at their house, conference opener, and we slipped up.
“We have that in the back of our minds.”
Carroll said that he considers it his job to keep the players’ attitudes in check.
“But I didn’t do a good enough job last year,” he said during his weekly afternoon press conference Tuesday. “We didn’t play as well as we could have. And hopefully we’ll capture what it takes and do well by this time.”

As a USC fan, it was alarming.
When freshman quarterback Matt Barkley approached the huddle before the Trojans went for the two-point conversion late Saturday night, ESPN announcer Brent Musburger added a little bit of bravado to the already tense situation.
False start · Matt Barkley’s performance Saturday was great, but let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves, columnist Pedro Moura writes. - Leah Thompson | Daily Trojan
“Right before your eyes, you’re watching a freshman grow up tonight, before a record-setting crowd in Columbus, Ohio,” Musburger said.
His partner in the booth, Kirk Herbstreit, went even further.
“Matt Barkley is going to go on to have a great career, but Brent, I think we’re always going to look back on his growth and maturation on that drive,” Herbstreit said when Ohio State turned the ball over on downs with 21 seconds remaining. “That drive that saved USC’s season and got them a huge win on the road.”
What? Maybe I’m crazy, but for most of the game, I was nervous about Barkley. And nervous as I should be, watching a 19-year-old quarterback make his second career start in an incredibly hostile environment.
And don’t get me wrong — I was impressed by Barkley’s poise on that final drive. I really was.
He did what he was asked to do and managed the Trojans to a come-from-behind victory over the No. 8 team in the nation, no easy task.
But to say that he is now a certifiable star? To say that he has officially come of age?
I disagree.
Come on: He completed 15 of 31 of his passes in the game — 48 percent, which would’ve been good for ninth in the Pac-10 last season — and some of the misses were glaring.
Remember that interception?
He bootlegged and saw a minute opening and then delivered an ill-advised, across-the-body pass to tight end senior Anthony McCoy that was picked off by Ohio State’s linebacker Ross Homan.
He has made that very mistake at least five times in practice this year. You wouldn’t see a fully matured quarterback make that throw unless he’s Brett Favre.
What about the overthrows? Nearly every time the Buckeye defensive line put significant pressure on him, Barkley missed his target.
And tell me, please, how exactly he grew up during “The Drive.”
Was it the swing route to junior running back Joe McKnight that aged him so? It was a glorified run play that McKnight turned into a big gain.
Or the nine-yard out to redshirt junior wide receiver Damian Williams? We all know that every quarterback on the team could’ve made that throw.
The QB sneaks? Nice, but are they really what makes a quarterback a star?
No. Let’s be frank: Barkley made one exceptional throw — the 26-yard missile to McCoy that sliced through double coverage. It was a great throw on first down that moved the chains.
Nice? Yes. Worthy of anointing that as “The Drive?”
Most certainly not.
Barkley had a good performance — nothing more. If Mark Sanchez had stayed for his senior season and completed 15-of-31 for 195 yards against the Buckeyes, his head would’ve been called for on a stick.
This whole idea, this whole construct of Barkley being the next King of Troy, can be traced down to one thing: the national media.
As soon as Barkley was named the starter in August, national columnists flocked to Howard Jones Field for interviews with the precocious then-18-year-old.
Since then, you can find a new article pretty much every day about the awe-inspiring freshman in Los Angeles.
Take a look at a couple articles after Saturday’s game:
The Associated Press’ first paragraph: “Two games into his college football career, 19-year-old quarterback Matt Barkley already has a place in Southern California lore.”
Even the Cleveland Plain Dealer’s headline was, “Young Barkley comes of age in victory.”
They have to take the extreme version of one side or the other to attract views and readers, so there’s this exaggerated view of Barkley’s performance that goes out to the general public. In reality, I’d argue that his performance was typical of a phenom’s: flashes of greatness but spots of immaturity as well.
Don’t get me wrong — I think Barkley will be the best in the nation by his junior season. And I definitely won’t be surprised if he makes it big at the next level. But to say that path is already guaranteed for him?
It’s way too early to do anything of the sort.

Last season, the USC men’s golf team walked onto every course with a veritable who’s who of amateur golfers.  The Trojans counted four All-Americans among their numbers and entered last season with a gaudy preseason ranking.  Injuries and a late-season swoon caused USC to dip in the polls, but the team still finished last season the No. 3 team in the country.
Three key players from that team are now playing professional golf.  Tom Glissmeyer graduated, while Jamie Lovemark and Tim Sluiter left school early to join him on the PGA Tour.

The onus of replacing them falls on fourth-year coach Chris Zambri, who acknowledged it would be difficult to replace their contributions.
“It’s hard because we’re not like 11 on offense and 11 on defense and you lose [five or seven] guys,” Zambri said.  “We’re losing 40 percent of our scoring.”
That shouldn’t paint a gloomy picture of the team’s prospects, however. There are still several talented golfers in the program.  Foremost among these players is junior Matthew Giles, who earned first-team All-American honors last year.  His return helps soften the blow from the early defections by Lovemark and Sluiter.
“He needs to lead us big time, which means he needs to go out and do what he did last year,” Zambri said.  “I want him to play like he did last year but I want him to be better.  I want him to win tournaments.”
Giles had seven top-7 finishes last season but failed to take first place in any tournament.  Zambri expects him to reverse that trend this year.
“Here’s a kid who wants to play pro golf, so he better have the same expectations or he needs to get a really good degree,” Zambri said. “If you plan on getting out there and playing against the big boys then you should be able to really fare well against the college level.”
Giles has the most impressive resumé of any returning Trojan, but he is not the only talented player on the roster. Sophomore Steve Lim looks to build on a strong freshman campaign that saw him shoot a final-round 66 at the West Regional to help USC advance to the NCAA Championship.  His ability to be a consistent scoring option will be important for the Trojans.
Another player coming in with high expectations is highly touted freshman TJ Vogel, who brings his clubs and a recent Junior PGA Championship to USC.  The Florida native won the championship this summer and should be an immediate contributor for the Trojans.
“When guys come out of the junior circuits with [a high] ranking and some good, solid wins under their belt, generally they come in and make an impact at this level,” Zambri said.
Vogel needs to be ready to compete right away if the Trojans wants to make noise this season in the Pac-10.  An old adage in sports says improvement only comes by playing people better than you.  USC will have ample opportunity this season to prove that theory correct.  Seven teams in the conference — including the Trojans — are ranked among the top 25 schools in the nation, according to one preseason poll.  Stanford, Washington and Arizona State are all ranked in the top six.
“It’s going to be a phenomenal year for the Pac-10,” Zambri said.  “I think Stanford might be the best team that I’ve seen since I’ve been at USC, certainly the best team in the Pac-10.”
Zambri said his young players were lucky to have a lot of opportunities to measure themselves against teams as talented as Stanford and Washington.
“It’s going to be an uphill climb for us to be able to beat them,” he said.  “It’ll be good for us.  It’ll make us better.”
That uphill climb begins Friday when the Trojans open their season at the Olympia Fields Invitational in Chicago, Ill.  The tournament should act as an early-season barometer for the Trojans as they take on conference foes Stanford and Arizona State.
“I think we’re in a position where we can be real competitive this year with some of our players from last year and definitely with some of our newer players,” Zambri said.

On Tuesday morning, three US congressmen held a press conference to announce the Respect for Marriage Act, a proposed law that would repeal the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act — which defines marriage as between a man and a woman.
At the conference, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) said that same-sex couples “have debunked the baseless myth that their marriages would somehow undermine or destroy the institution of marriage. The sky has not fallen, as our opponents had argued it would.” The true harm of the law, he said, “is the harm it causes same-sex couples and their families.”
This is a bill that has very little chance of passing. Though it has 90 co-sponsors, they are all Democrats. There is also no comparable bill under consideration in the Senate, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has indicated that repealing DOMA will be a low priority for her party. Additionally, openly gay Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) has said that he does not believe that a repeal of DOMA could get through Congress anytime soon.
The unwillingness of Democratic leaders to push on this issue is understandable. They are in the midst of a bitter fight over health care reform, and it would probably be bad strategy for them to antagonize the Right any further. The passage of Proposition 8 last year in what is widely considered one of America’s most liberal states indicates the extent of the opposition to legalizing gay marriage, and the Democrats certainly do not want to awaken that sleeping giant and add to their current troubles.
However, just because something is understandable does not mean it is right. DOMA has always been, and continues to be, a system of codified discrimination against homosexuals. The US has traditionally prided itself on the protection that it offers to its minorities, but that stance is challenged by the hatred and fear-motivated popular resistance against allowing gays and lesbians to call themselves “married.”
Opponents of recognizing same-sex marriages often use apocalyptic arguments but, as Nadler mentioned, in the states in which homosexuals are allowed to get married, the sky has not fallen. Men and women still get married and have children, just like in every other state. In fact, those states — Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and Iowa — are often stereotyped as places that do not face many of the social problems that exist in places where homosexuals are not permitted to express themselves on the same level as everyone else.
Opponents also like to say that repealing DOMA would harm “the sanctity of marriage.” This is the argument that I find most laughable. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2009 there were nearly half as many divorces as marriages in our country. I think it is safe to say that whatever sanctity of marriage was inherited by our parents’ and grandparents’ generations has gone out the window by now. So, what exactly are we protecting?
I really believe that many of the people making these arguments see through them as much as I do. These polemics serve as facades for what is often simply fear and hatred of homosexuality — something that is as hard to debate as it is to overcome, and something that is a giant red flag for liberal-minded policymakers.
I have little doubt that our government’s discrimination against homosexuals will disappear with the passage of time. A May 2009 CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll showed 54 percent of respondents opposed to same-sex marriage and 44 percent in favor of it; among 18- to 34-year-olds, 58 percent supported same-sex marriage. That percentage goes down as age rises, culminating in only 24 percent of Americans 65 and older supporting the recognition of same-sex marriages.
History shows that this pattern is a common one. In 1948, about 90 percent of American adults opposed legalizing interracial marriage. In 1967, the number was 72 percent, and only in 1991 did those opposed to it finally become a minority. As people who were raised to have a completely outdated outlook die and younger generations begin to dominate the population, public opinion shifts to demand a more tolerant and inclusive society.
But waiting for the inevitable is an unacceptable way of dealing with a problem when it means prolonging the pain that many homosexuals in America feel because their country tells them that something is wrong with them. Interracial marriage was legalized in California in 1948 and nationally in 1967, despite widespread opposition. Thanks to the brave efforts of those who fought for what was right, people who loved someone of a different race did not have to wait decades in order to get married just because that was how long it took for the inevitable to happen.
If this issue is something that you feel strongly about, do something. Write to your congressperson — especially if he or she is not one of the 90 co-sponsors of the Respect for Marriage Act. Talk to a friend or relative about same-sex marriage, because they may not know that our federal government has an official policy against it or that a sliver of opportunity exists to repeal the policy this year.
It is time for our representatives to stop waiting for the inevitable. The time is now to put official discrimination against homosexuals where it belongs — in the dustbin of history.

People who discredit or just don’t care about global warming are like drunk gamblers in a casino who bet away the deeds to their homes: They are taking a massive risk that will almost certainly result in homelessness, and they are likely to be wearing teal, polyester stretch pants.
Global warming, if nothing else, is the one cause that the entire world should be able to unite under. Cultural, geographic and religious differences aside, as a race, humans have one thing that we all share — and that thing is Earth.
Thomas Curry | Daily Trojan
There is a case to be made that we are not, in fact, all on the same planet. Surely, the cast of The View is visiting from a space station for the insane. And it’s hard to believe that the musical artist Lady GaGa exists in the same solar system, let alone the same celestial body, as the rest of humanity.
Still, we’re all stuck here together and global warming is claiming victims all over the place, each more adorable than the last. Snowy owls, polar bears and emperor penguins are all reported to be at risk because of the effects of global warming on arctic and antarctic ecosystems, and this is to say nothing of the extreme weather, rising sea levels and melting permafrosts that are already wreaking havoc on our world.
But if furry baby animals and the threat of catastrophic natural disasters can’t unite us, can anything?
There is hope. Just last Sunday, our nation came together, and through various means of viral communication, declared that Kanye West was a dick. Even President Barack Obama added his voice to the crowd.
But, already, the nation’s sympathy for Taylor Swift has dissipated: Most of us have remembered that we don’t like country music anyway, and we have reminded ourselves that the Video Music Awards lost their relevance years ago.
Luckily, there is one more thing with the potential to unite us all — not just as a nation, but as a species. And that thing is beer.
According to a climatologist at the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute, the quality of hops used to make pilsner lager has been decreasing in the last few years because of increased air temperature, courtesy of global warming.
The problem is because the acidity of the hops — which gives pilsner its slightly bitter taste — has been declining by 0.06 percent per year since 1954.
The beer endangerment in all likelihood will only be a minor problem at first, since the hops measured in the study were grown only in Eastern Europe.
What this means is that for a few years, only imported brews and pretentious drafts will be affected, and there will still be cause for global warming deniers to argue that climate change, like arugula and free trade coffee, is just an affectation of the elitist upper class.
But, there’s no saying that similar climate problems won’t soon affect the rest of the beer industry. Beers across the world could gradually become weaker and weaker until even Guinness tastes like Bud Light.
Imagine, we could one day look back on our college days and think wistfully of the Natural Light we consumed so thoughtlessly, not taking care to savor the flavor that will have since left all beers. God forbid.
The first stop to putting an end to this will be to have the president make an off-the-record comment about global warming and beer. And united we will stand.
