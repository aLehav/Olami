As part of the Joint Education Project’s 40th anniversary, the organization created a program with international students and formed partnerships with USC Cadets and California Conservations Corps.

USC students participating in the program teach and mentor high school and middle school students. JEP has been adding programs in the past decade as more students decide to serve.
Tammy Anderson, executive director of JEP, said on average 1,100 students participate in JEP each semester and 20 to 25 percent of those students have participated before.
“It just shows that more and more, our students want to be involved. They want to be part of the solution to problems and test out their own abilities,” Anderson said.
This semester, JEP created a program for international relations students and formed new partnerships with USC Cadets, who will help them run a boot camp, and the California Conservation Corps.
“We try to add programs that will give our students different experiences than [those] we already offer,” Anderson said.
Travis Glynn, a junior majoring in international relations who has worked at JEP for two years, runs the new program. He said it will allow students form USC to talk at middle schools and high schools about international relations issues related to Los Angeles.
“We will discuss issues ranging from trade and migration to court security and public safety,” Glynn said.
JEP will also be continuing a program that allows international students to teach about their homelands and cultures.
Though plans to formally celebrate JEP’s 40th anniversary have been postponed until the house is finished, Anderson is encouraging students who have participated in JEP to go online to share their most memorable moments working at JEP.
“It’s an important milestone for a program like ours to be at a big research university like USC for so long. Its students want to be engaged, and our full time staff and student staff have been here and committed to the program,” Anderson said. “That’s the key to why we’ve been so successful.”
The JEP house is being renovated for the next nine months to provide more space for the growing program. JEP is now temporarily housed at The Lot.
JEP Program Assistant Coordinator Nicole Kohansamad. a junior majoring in business, said the project allows students to interact with the community in a new way.
“It’s a small amount of time during your week that will have a big impact on you. It exposes you to what is going on in the community, and it gets you out of the USC bubble,” Kohansamad said. “JEP is really for someone who wants a rewarding experience to learn about other people and themselves.”

The No. 5 USC Trojans traveled to Provo, Utah Saturday to face the No. 1 BYU Cougars in two days’ worth of matches.
BYU (6-1, 4-0) beat the Trojans (3-2, 2-2) in both matches in front of two sets of raucous crowds. On Friday night, the stadium held 4,261 spectators — one of the most-watched matches in BYU history.
Getting served · Senior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli was not able to lead the Trojans past the Cougars on Saturday. With the loss, the Trojans fall to 3-2 overall and remain behind UCLA and Stanford in the conference. - Daily Trojan file photo
In the first match, the Cougars put together a series of long-scoring runs, including a 7-0 run late in the mostly-USC dominated fourth set to lead to a BYU victory.
“We have a very high volleyball IQ as a team, but we’re not that physical,” said coach Bill Ferguson. “We have to out-think, out-grind, and out-scrap the other team for points. It’s a tough way to play and there will be some lulls, but we can find a way to manage and shorten them.”
Senior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli and middle blocker Steven Shandrick, as well as redshirt junior  outside hitter Steven Mochalski, led a three-pronged force against the Cougars. Ciarelli finished with 26 kills at a .364 clip, Mochalski had 13 kills at .348 and Shandrick finished with 11 kills.
“We’ve never been in an environment like that but we surprisingly played really loose,” said Ciarelli. “It really surprised me because we have a lot of young guys.”
 
In Saturday’s match, the Trojans redesigned their attack in an effort to spread the ball around the court more to create creases in the Cougars’ staunch defense.
“Offensively, I’ve had a great connection with Micah [Christensen],” Shandrick said. “They had a double block on me all weekend and it opened up a lot for our other hitters, especially Tony [Ciarelli].”
After falling behind early in the first set of the match, the Trojans ratcheted up their serving intensity and defense and turned the match into a back-and-forth slugfest.
“Ciarelli, [RS sophomore opposite Tanner] Jansen and [freshman setter Micah] Christensen really lit up the serving line for us,” Ferguson said. At altitude such as that of Provo, teams tend to pull back because the ball sails out of bounds. But these three guys stayed aggressive and put them out of system with strong serving.”
A furious late comeback in set one and a victory in set two left the match tied up. After losing the third set and winning the next behind stellar serving i, the Trojans set the stage for an upset victory in the match tiebreaker. After a back-and-forth set where no team led by more than two points, the Trojans eventually lost by a score of 15-13.
“We’re not big on moral victories, but these last two games have really showed how much fight we have,” Ciarelli said. “We’re never going to accept failure; never going to accept a loss. We’re going to take all of next week and work our asses off so we can come back with a victory.”
Should have had some more Kneaders. I work there and always enjoy seeing the Trojans come through for lunch when they are in Provo.

In an unpredictable game that featured 25 lead changes, Oregon State (12-7, 3-5) came out on top over the USC Women of Troy (10-7, 5-2) in a 65-61 overtime contest at the Galen Center, despite a game-high 20 points from senior guard Ashley Corral.
With 5.8 seconds left to go in overtime, Oregon State guard Alyssa Martin sank two free throws to seal the game and effectively end USC’s five-game winning streak. After the loss, USC fell to third in Pac-12 standings behind California (14-5, 5-2) and Stanford (17-1, 8-0).
USC had a chance to win following a timeout with 1.1 seconds remaining in regulation and the game tied at 56 apiece, but the clock expired before the Women of Troy could pull off a shot.
In overtime, the Beavers countered a 3-pointer by Corral and a layup by USC senior guard Briana Gilbreath by attacking the paint and finishing three layups of their own.
With the Beavers leading by two points with 19 seconds left in overtime, Corral misfired a three-pointer that would have given USC the lead. Instead, the Beavers regained possession, leading to Martin’s free throws that ended USC’s chances of winning.
Throughout the game, the Beavers utilized a balanced offensive attack behind guard Sage Indendi’s 17 points. They started the game shooting 64 percent in the first half, including 4-for-6 from behind the arc.
In the second half, the Women of Troy stepped up their defense and held the Beavers to 28 percent shooting. However, they were unable to take advantage of the misses, shooting 21.9 percent in the latter half themselves.
Despite their poor shooting, the Women of Troy stayed in the game with their rebounding. Oregon State held a 41-38 rebound advantage, but USC had 13 offensive boards compared to Oregon State’s 6, which led to 12 second-chance points for the home team.
Corral led the team’s offensive attack by dropping a total of six 3-pointers on the Beavers, including three consecutive after halftime. Sophomore forward Cassie Harberts also contributed 10 points for the Women of Troy.
Gilbreath could not match her performance in a 92-73 victory over Oregon two days prior when she came up a rebound shy of a triple-double. Against the Beavers, Gilbreath scored nine points to go with eight rebounds and two assists.
Senior forward Christina Marinacci, who notched a double-double against Oregon, shot 1-for-9 from the field for only two points, but led USC with four assists.
Before its first loss of the year, USC had defeated California, Arizona State, Arizona, UCLA and Oregon by an average of 12 points. The Women of Troy look to get back on track with a visit to Colorado (13-4, 2-4) on Thursday.

Résumés don’t lie. Well, not most of the time.
Through the first 17 games of this season, the USC women’s basketball team has compiled a 10-7 overall mark in spite of playing the third- toughest nonconference slate in the country, according to RealTimeRPI.com.
Missing piece · Without the services of senior guard Jacki Gemelos, who tore her ACL in December, the Women of Troy have managed to win six of their last eight games, including wins over UCLA and Oregon. - Daily Trojan file photo
The Women of Troy, who are 5-2 in Pac-12 play, are also projected by most Bracketology experts to secure a bid to the NCAA tournament come March for the first time since 2006.
Considering the preseason expectations -— when they were ranked No. 23 in the Associated Press top-25 poll — this is about right where they should be. Nearly midway through conference play, this looks like the team we thought we would see in mid-January.
Yes, by and large, they’re playing well.
Even without senior guard Jacki Gemelos, who underwent her fifth reconstructive knee surgery after a Dec. 18 contest at Texas A&M, USC coach Michael Cooper’s resilient bunch has trudged forward. It would have been easy to sulk, or to cite injuries as a reason for poor performances.  After all, it has had an effect. Instead, since Gemelos’ season-ending injury, they are playing as well as they have played all season, winning six of their last eight games, including five of seven during Pac-12 play.
Sure, Saturday’s overtime loss to Oregon State at the Galen Center in front of an announced crowd of 1,803 -— the largest of the season — was embarrassing, which ended up snapping a five-game winning streak. Cooper conceded as much in the moments following the disappointing finish.
“When you want to be an elite team — and I’m not saying Oregon State is a bad team — you have to win these games at home,” the third-year coach said after the disappointing game.
Despite its recent surge, USC didn’t play well on Saturday. It let the Beavers, who had won just two conference games entering the contest, shoot 46 percent from the field and a remarkably high 64 percent in the first half.
The Women of Troy pride themselves on their defensive fortitude, but that was evidently lacking, at least for most of the game.
But adjusting to Gemelos’ absence isn’t as easy as the Women of Troy have made it look thus far. After all, the Stockton, Calif. native led the conference in 3-point shooting percentage a season ago, and through nine games this season, averaged 11.2 points per game. That’s a substantial amount of production to lose for a team with high aspirations.
With Gemelos sidelined, senior guard Ashley Corral, who served more as a point guard prior to the injury, has been forced to shoulder even more of the scoring load. Against the Beavers, she hoisted 17 shot attempts for a game-high 20 points.
“She’s been asked to play a different role with our ball club,” Cooper said. “She’s doing a little more than she’s supposed to.”
Corral isn’t the only one doing more than was expected earlier in the season. Freshman guard Ariya Crook has been inserted into the lineup on a more frequent basis to share some of the point guard duties with Corral. In 19 minutes Saturday, she had one turnover and no assists. Playing point guard in major Division I college basketball is no small task.
It’s been a lot to handle, collectively, as evidenced by a sloppy game against visiting Oregon State, where the Women of Troy shot just 7-15 from the free-throw line and had 14 turnovers, as well.
But this is an experienced team, a team that boasts four upperclassmen in its starting lineup, including two seniors and a fourth-year junior, and though Saturday’s disappointing defeat was certainly frustrating for many in the cardinal and gold, they should recover. They’re too good not to.
They still feature two of the conference’s most talented players in Corral and senior guard Briana Gilbreath. Defensively, they have been exceptional, too -— at least for the majority of inter-conference play.
“There has been a lot of improvement with us as a team,” said Cooper, who is 53-32 in three seasons with the Women of Troy. “This is just a little setback and we’ll continue moving forward.”
Come March, Saturday will likely be a blemish on an already impressive resume.

The men’s basketball team could not put an end to its longest losing streak since the 1995-1996 season on Saturday, falling to Oregon State (13-7, 3-5) at Gill Coliseum, 78-59. The Trojans (5-15, 0-7) have lost eight straight games and are the only team in the Pac-12 without a conference victory.
Not quite enough · The Trojans had three players in double figures Saturday night, including sophomore guard Maurice Jones. USC was down by 14 at halftime and did not hold a lead past the 14-minute mark in the first half. The Trojans are now 5-15 overall. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
After jumping to an early 8-5 advantage, USC relinquished its lead to the Beavers with 14:15 remaining in the first half and never got it back. Oregon State led 36-22 going into the break and cruised to an easy win after outscoring the Trojans by five in the final 20 minutes of action. USC played a sloppy game, committing 18 turnovers and struggling to break out of Oregon State’s trapping defense.
“When you turn the ball over as much as we did, you’re not going to have a chance to win on the road,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “They did a good job with their 1-3-1 trap; we didn’t do a good job of handling and attacking it and getting into the paint.”
Freshman guard Byron Wesley led the Trojans with 15 points on an efficient 7-10 shooting night. Sophomore guard Maurice Jones added 13, sophomore forward Garrett Jackson had 12 and sophomore forward Dewayne Dedmon, coming off an impressive 18-point performance against Oregon, finished with eight points and eight rebounds.
The Beavers, meanwhile, were led by guard Jared Cunningham, who put up 18 points, five assists, three rebounds and two steals in 28 minutes of action.
“That guy is going to play for money someday,” O’Neill said. “He’s definitely an NBA prospect, a guy who is going to play at the next level as a point guard. He’s got an NBA body, he’s a legit first team all Pac-12 player, so I’m not surprised he played like that.”
Three of Oregon State’s players hit double digits, with forward Devon Collier scoring 12 points, center Joe Burton with 11 and guard Ahmad Starks with 10. Forward Eric Moreland chipped in defensively, contributing 11 rebounds, three steals and two blocks.
“We played well up at Oregon, didn’t play well [on Saturday],” O’Neill said. “Oregon State played well, and they deserved to win.”
The Trojans had just seven scholarship players on the roster because of an assortment of injuries, prompting O’Neill to insert junior walk-on Daniel Munoz into the starting lineup. Munoz finished with three points, two assists, and four turnovers in twelve minutes on the court.
“The bottom line is when you’ve got two walk-ons in your rotation and you’re starting one of them, it’s not going to be a good situation,” O’Neill said.
O’Neill will need to decide whether to keep Munoz as the starting point guard when the Trojans return home for a matchup against Colorado (13-6, 5-2) on Thursday. The Trojans will follow that up with a game against Utah (5-14, 2-5) on Jan. 28.
“We’ll see how it goes,’ O’Neill said. “Daniel played really well the other night, he didn’t play so well tonight, but all of these guys are in roles they really can’t handle right now because of all of our injury problems.”
With so many players out of the rotation, a return to the Galen Center might be the one thing the Trojans have going for them as they attempt to squash an eight-game losing streak.

USC has begun refurbishing Doheny Memorial Library’s elevators that are used to access the book stacks. This renovation is expected to be completed on June 27.
The elevators are being renovated to improve access to the stacks and to upgrade the overall conditions at Doheny, said Hugh McHarg, executive director of communications and public programming.
“The environment of the library is very important, and we want it to be inviting,” McHarg said. “The elevators are being renovated essentially for routine maintenance but also so there will be better service, and [the elevators] will be faster and more reliable.”
During the process of renovation, the stairs and one elevator will be available for people to access the stacks. The elevator currently being refurbished will be closed until April.
McHarg said the university is also looking into other upgrades for Doheny.
“We are currently looking at what we can do to make changes in regards to the electric [outlets]as well, since the reference room has many people, but not as many [outlets] for them to utilize,” McHarg said.
Nosheen Salehani, a junior majoring in psychology, said the improvements to the elevators will be beneficial.
“It’s beneficial to Doheny because the elevators are old,” Salehani said. “I like the way the library is right now because the whole structure of Doheny looks ancient and makes it different from other libraries.”
I’ll kinda miss the old ones. Clanking and rattling, stopping three inches below the floor, never sure if you were going to plunge to your death. Made going to the stacks feel like walking into a horror movie, which is way more exciting than research.
I love the stacks!  Where am I going to mb on campus during this work?
Forget about renovating Doheny.. Doheny is our classic historic library. USC Libraries and Admin need to put in some money for AT LEAST a new paint job, tile, carpet and chairs in Leavey.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety daily incident log  for Thursday, Jan. 19. 
Crimes against a person
at 8:08 p.m., a suspect approached a non-USC female from behind and pushed her against the driver’s side door as she was searching her purse for her vehicle keys near 28th and Hoover streets. The suspect held the female against the door and removed a wallet from the purse while a second suspect blocked her escape route. Both suspects fled on foot. DPS officers responded and conducted a search, but were unable to locate the suspects.
at 5:38 p.m., a student in Century Apartments said she has been the target of ongoing aggressive and threatening behavior by her roommate, also a student, and it has caused her to fear for her safety.
At 2:30 p.m., a suspect approached a juvenile who was standing at a bus stop at Jefferson Boulevard and Grand Avenue and slapped a cellphone out of his hand. The suspect bent down to pick up the phone and he struck the juvenile in the head when he attempted to pick it up. The suspect fled when a witness flagged down passing DPS officers, but he was subsequently detained. The juvenile and the witness both positively identified the suspect during a field “show-up.” The suspect was arrested.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 10:10 a.m., DPS officers responded to a student who said he was struck by a vehicle while riding his bicycle near 30th Street and McClintock Avenue. The student sustained injuries to his shoulder and wrist and was being examined by an LAFD RA unit when the officers arrived. The student said the driver of the vehicle exchanged contact information with him and left the scene after he told the driver that he was not injured, but that he began experiencing pain later. The student was released at the scene.

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, USC spent $580,000 last year lobbying the local, state and federal government on issues including Cal Grants, academic research funding and health — a $260,000 decrease from the previous year.

Many nonprofit universities use a portion of their budget to lobby for issues affecting the university. USC outspent many universities of its caliber in 2011, with Stanford’s expenses totaling $330,000 and New York University’s totaling $400,000.
USC lobbies at the federal level in Washington, D.C., at the state level in Sacramento and locally in Los Angeles. Though each office works independently, the issues they focus on often overlap.
David Galaviz, the executive director of local government relations for USC, said the university focuses on financial aid, funding for research and other issues that impact students.
“It’s not lobbying in a traditional sense of something nefarious, it’s more lobbying for university priorities — either research, student aid or just day-to-day infrastructure needs of the university,” Galaviz said.
Locally, projects such as the redevelopment plan for The Village at USC, are high on the university’s  respective agenda, while broader issues such as financial aid are more important at the state level.
Veronica Villalobos, the executive director of state government relations in Sacramento, said her office focuses mainly on financial aid because it directly impacts students.
“The governor came out with a budget proposal last week that would cut the Cal Grant for students in nonprofit universities by over 40 percent,” Villalobos said. “Over 1,800 USC students receive grants that would be cut.”
Protecting students at private universities from financial aid cuts can often be an issue in state government, Villalobos said.
“A lot of the time, nonprofit educational institutions are forgotten because the legislature often relies on public universities,” Villalobos said. “If there is a bill that gives loan forgiveness to students in medical school, for instance, a lot of the time the first thought is to target UC students instead of USC students who also need loan assistance.”
The university also campaigns for financial aid at the national level, such as Pell Grants, USC Executive Director of Federal Relations Jennifer Grodsky said.
Academic research also factors into the lobbying process, Grodsky said. The university shares its research with legislators to keep USC involved in the legislative process.
“If someone at USC is doing research on something like bullying, we will connect them to lawmakers working on a bill about that subject so they can make a better bill,” Grodsky said. “We spend a lot of time thinking about how we can share our expertise.”
Connecting lawmakers to researchers helps the government keep the university in mind when they write bills about higher education, Villalobos said.
“This way the research doesn’t sit on the shelf, and the legislature sees the university as a public resource,” Villalobos said. “Otherwise you can get forgotten, and that’s not good public policy.”
Though the topics the university focuses on vary, the motivation to keep USC engaged in the political conversation stays constant.
At each level of the process, lobbyists said the most important factor is keeping the university involved.
“My job is to make sure the university does not exist in the vacuum, but that it’s tied into the city and county of Los Angeles and that the university is an active and engaged member of civic life,” Galaviz said.
Getting the university involved in city, state and national projects also helps USC become a bigger player in legislative decisions.
“We want to contribute to the conversation,” Villalobos said. “We’re the largest employer in Los Angeles, we’re a health care provider, and we have a lot of different roles impacted by the state.”
As USC becomes more involved with lobbying at all levels of government, Grodsky said she sees legislators paying more attention to the university.
“Policy makers are really looking to anchor institutions like USC,” Grodsky said. “President Nikias is not only a leader in Los Angeles but also a national leader. So if he says something is an issue our students are facing, the government is going to pay attention.”
Though the bills that pass with help from USC’s lobbying efforts are a significant plus, gaining the government’s attention might be the biggest benefit of lobbying, Grodsky said.
“You have to have a voice,” Grodsky said. “You want to have a seat at the table. There are so many decisions made every day that impact us.”

Beer is beer, right? If the idea of all beers being indistinguishable, watery ways toward intoxication is your thing, it’s time to open your mind and your palate.
Now is a great time to be in Los Angeles. Alongside a re-emerged and stronger-than-ever cocktail scene, craft and high-end beer joints are sprouting up across the city. These places often contain styles you’ve never heard of and bartenders who will talk about a brew’s nuances as if it were a fine wine.
The latest of these beer-focused venues is Little Bear. Located across the street from Church & State French bistro in the Arts District, it’s another anomaly to the location; a modern, sleek building and concept nestled in an area full of empty warehouses and shady alleys. Set up by people from the Verdugo Bar and Surly Goat, it’s a Belgian pub, although it’s one filtered through the design style of Los Angeles.
Little Bear is in one of those loft-style buildings with high ceilings, bare floors and only a few touches of its Belgian focus — trappist brewery signs, mounted wall ornaments and wooden panels. Beyond that it’s minimal, and that’s one of its main flaws.
Tables are limited, making the wait longer than would be expected, even before the pub gets packed with the drinking crowd. It’s possible to find a place at the bar, but unless you’re content holding a drink and milling around, it isn’t the most enjoyable setup. The wait, however, is worth it.
As with most new restaurants with even the tiniest focus on alcohol, the bar goes beyond the basic mix-with-soda spirits. Whiskeys and more Western European drinks line the counter — keeping with the Belgian aesthetics of the place. But this is a beer pub, and that’s where Little Bear truly shines.
To call the beer menu anything less than extensive would be a disservice. All the beers are either imported from Belgium or  brewed in Belgian styles. The bottle list contains some of the more familiar names — Chimay, Westmalle and Huyghe if possible — but goes deeper with more varieties. And the draft list is even better. It’s a rotating menu of multiple breweries, offering 16 beers, with everything from Unibroue’s heavy, slightly bitter Trois Pistoles to Cuvée Des Jacobins Rouge’s more tannic, wine-like Flemish red ale. Amounts and glass styles vary, but everything is designed to bring out the beers’ best attributes.
Different styles abound, but owing to its focus, there are not many light or mellow brews. So anyone who’s used to only American lagers or pilsners might find it difficult to acquire the taste. Thankfully, the bartenders are more than helpful, ready to chat about different beers, offer small samples to help you find what you want or help you pair drinks with food.
The beers are the bar’s focus, and the variety alone is astonishing.  But Little Bear’s food menu is also worth exploring. The bar’s design is Belgium by way of Los Angeles, taking some traditional dishes and using the seasonal, fresh ingredients of California. Grilled cheese sandwiches play a heavy part in the menu, but they’re stuffed with everything from brisket to smoked salmon. And the flavors work well together, especially in the apple and port wine marmalade sandwich, which balances a sweet fruity flavor with the savory Stilton cheese and salty bread. Pair with a Flemish red and it is a very satisfying meal.
Other dishes are just as plentiful in taste. The moules frites, technically an appetizer, can feed two people or provide a very filling meal for one hungry person. Salads are packed full of ingredients beyond leafy greens while the entrées are more along traditional pub fare lines — hearty meat and potato-style dishes given the gourmet makeover. Little Bear definitely provides your money’s worth in terms of portions.
Little Bear isn’t exactly the most genuine Belgian pub, but it makes up for this lack of authenticity with excellent food and a wonderful beer list. Though it is out of the way and quickly fills up, if beer is your thing or you’re trying to expand your culinary horizons, this beer cafe is a great place to start.

If you look hard enough in Los Angeles, you can find almost anything. The city and the surrounding area are known for obvious landmarks, such as the Hollywood sign, but there are smaller, more hidden destinations that are also worth a visit. If you venture into the smaller parts of the city, or simply keep an eye out in popular areas, you can spot hidden gems that offer a different version of city life.
The Last Bookstore serves as a prime example of one of L.A.’s finest literary secret.
With the advent of technology, readers have exchanged hardcovers and paperbacks for Kindles and Nooks. But when Borders announced that it would be closing, readers still yearning for a place to sit with a book didn’t take the news too well. To a group of aspiring writers, longtime bookworms and everyone in between, the impending disappearance of the beloved bookstore chain was tragic.
That’s where The Last Bookstore comes in.
This hidden gem in Downtown Los Angeles began as an online venture and existed at another location in Downtown Los Angeles before settling down on Fifth Avenue and Spring Street. The name that was ironic in 2005 is surprisingly apt today.
The bookstore embodies the meaning behind the name by refusing to follow suit with most other bookstores — The Last Bookstore has not gone digital. You won’t find a Nook on sale here. Instead, you will find shelves dedicated to CDs, DVDs and magazines; an impressive collection of records; and, of course, plenty of books. With book genres ranging from poetry to sci-fi, The Last Bookstore is one fairly large floor of book-lover paradise.
And it’s not too hard on your wallet, either. When you first enter, you are surrounded by a small room, beautiful shelves and a heavenly sign that reads ‘All books in this room: $1.00.’
From some lesser-known authors to big-name best-sellers, such as John Grisham and USC professor T.C. Boyle, the shelves promise a good read for a cheap price. Once you step into the high-ceiling store, readers will find books that range from less than $10 to higher yet reasonable prices.
Part of the reason some books are so cheap is The Last Bookstore sells plenty of used titles. Even midday on a weekday, one can find people going in and out with dollies either full of boxes or just emptied.
But if you just want to come in and read a book, that’s cool with the bookstore workers.
Sure, you can sit with your Nook/iPod/whatever-you-call-it and digitally flip through pages in the comfort of your own house, but The Last Bookstore lets you hold a new or used book in your hands in a chic-vintage, one-of-a-kind interior. The store is decorated with things like elephant tusks and mannequins. Even when you go to the checkout, you will see that the counter is made up of books. It’s like an Amoeba Records meets Best Buy meets Borders meets Goodwill, decorated by someone’s hipster sister.
Somehow, The Last Bookstore manages to do it all: It’s new and intriguing in a historically rich part of Downtown Los Angeles, and it stays true to the idea of a good old-fashioned bookstore.
There is something that will keep people coming back to the physical covers of books and even the thin sleeves of records, but beyond the business aspect of the store lies a communal feeling. It’s savvy to feed into bookworms’ needs for a store, but The Last Bookstore also exists as a comfortable space for Downtown Los Angeles residents, regardless of whether or not they are looking to buy something.
On certain nights, when the Downtown Art Walk occurs, you can catch a band playing on a small area with couches set aside as a stage. The bookstore also hosts an open mic every Monday from 9:00 to 11:30 p.m.
The streets of Downtown Los Angeles are still being transformed thanks to the blooming of small cafes, trendy restaurants and everything in between, and The Last Bookstore is a big contributor to that change. It holds its place as a game-changer in the face of a bleak outlook for the bookstore business. As the years pass, the bookstore will undoubtedly become even more of a rarity, but this will only add to The Last Bookstore’s value.
The store is not a dusty, echoing place devoid of people. It’s a bright business with adults and kids roaming its shelves and with the help of enough stubborn bookworms, this unique bookstore can stay that way.
 
The Last Bookstore is located on 453 South Spring St.

About a third of the way through the new George Lucas-produced film Red Tails, the 332nd Fighter Group, better known as the Tuskegee Airmen or “Red Tails,” receives all-new, P-51 fighters. The group, led by Maj. Emanuelle Stance (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Col. A.J. Bullard (Terrence Howard), is finally going to get the chance to make a difference.
But first, they have got to paint those aircraft tails red.
It’s the kind of scene that’s supposed to make you smile, and it does. The problem with the scene, and the rest of this overly long film, is that it’s a completely predictable transition point — of course they’re going to paint the tails red, it’s in the name of the movie — and one that’s delivered so bluntly, so forcefully and with so many unnecessary clichés you have no choice but to realize that you’re watching a movie.
The film is not an immersive look at the fascinating story of the Tuskegee Airmen; in fact, for all the obvious good intentions of Red Tails, the film never even comes close.
Red Tails valiantly sets out to tell the story of the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of well-trained, primarily black fighter pilots.
Despite rampant racism in the World War II-era U.S. armed forces, the Airmen were deployed late in the war to much acclaim, success and acceptance among other pilots in the force.
The film picks up, however, just as the group is facing the danger of the entire team being shut down because of the perception that they’re not functioning successfully. The problem is that though the group is deployed to Europe, they’re not on the front lines and thus have nothing to show for their skill and training.
While Col. Bullard travels to the Pentagon to fight for the group’s existence, the boys are stationed in Italy, far from the front lines, and morale sinks to new lows. Bullard saves his unit, however, and everything starts to look up for the Red Tails. New planes for the team means more dogfighting scenes, which feel real and provide the film with some much-needed adrenaline, thanks to Lucas’ impressive special effects.
Television-turned-film director Anthony Hemingway (Treme, The Wire) deftly makes these scenes mean more to the audience than anything that’s happening on the ground. It’s a good thing, too, because without this sense of importance or reality, the characters have almost nothing to stand — or fly — on by themselves.
Red Tails also follows the story of squadron leader Marty “Easy” Julian (Nate Parker) and his best friend, the wild-child Joe “Lightning” Little (David Oyelowo). Unfortunately, their actions throughout the film consist of things the audience probably could have predicted and written themselves: Lightning has a problem with Easy’s drinking, Easy struggles with Lightning not following orders in the air, Lightning falls head over heels for an Italian woman who knows no English and Easy’s constant self-pity is admonished by Col. Bullard.
These moments are delivered with an almost comical conviction, as if the audience is supposed to be seeing characteristics never before seen in any movie.
It’s really not that Parker, Oyelowo or any of their squad-mates fail to live up to the script and storyline they’re provided. Ne-Yo and Tristan Wilds make surprisingly good appearances, and Howard, at least temporarily and to some avail, seems to want to save the film.
But, the group, and Gooding Jr.’s pipe-smoking, brash character in particular, is one-dimensional; the already straightforward story detracts from what are otherwise solid performances across the board.
The Tuskegee Airmen have often been lost in the wider spectrum of stories more commonly told when Hollywood tackles World War II. Part of the reason for this, at least according to Lucas, was that studios were wary of backing a movie with a nearly all-black cast.
The members of the Tuskegee Airmen, however, still deserved a far better result than their likenesses being pitted against the most hilariously formulaic German villain since the Nazi henchmen in Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Lucas reportedly began trying to get Red Tails to the big screen since 1988.  Moreover, this film is apparently the middle of a three-part series in the works of films on the Airmen.
Audiences can only hope that this capable group, led by Gooding Jr. in his first feature film in five years, gets better material if it does turn into a three-part series.
With any luck, the potential series won’t turn out as comically disappointing as Lucas’ last trilogy.

Spanish department should help students fulfill requirements
Most students at USC are familiar with the language requirement. It’s often stressful to figure out how to fit all our major requirements around three semesters of our chosen language — usually Spanish, since it’s crucial for many professions.
One would expect that the Spanish department would ensure each student could be accommodated.
Unfortunately, that’s not the case. In the first week of classes, the first and third levels of Spanish had openings. Spanish II did not.
My expected graduation date is Spring 2012. Due to a packed course load, I understood that I would need to complete Spanish III this coming summer after my graduation ceremony.
What I did not expect was a complete inability to get into Spanish II.
More than that, I did not expect nine other students from the first class I crashed, and eight other students from the second, to have the same issues I was having.
All nine of us, from the second class, visited the director of the Spanish department. We presented our concerns: Some of us would be unable to start graduate school, others would be unable to graduate at all and still others would be unable to continue their study of Spanish until the following fall semester, losing skills in the meantime.
The director was sympathetic; however, we left unsure that anything would be changed.
But a bigger issue looms. In the first class I crashed, the professor explained that classes are capped at 19 students to maintain the “prestige” of the program. Community colleges have larger classes, she explained, and are therefore less prestigious.
Instead of adding more classes, the Spanish department is leaving students stranded.
If languages, such as Spanish, are requirements for graduation, shouldn’t USC have a responsibility to ensure that students can enroll without issue? We certainly pay enough.

“still others would be unable to continue their study of Spanish until the following fall semester, losing skills in the meantime”
THIS is the problem with the majority of people who take language classes. You think it ends when class does. People wonder why America can’t speak other languages. One would only “lose skills” if he/she neglected to do anything at all. Do these “others” watch Spanish-language TV? There is plenty in LA. What about read Spanish books? Join SUSA to participate in conversation tables or movie-watching events? Check out books to get you to write/read better?
This is why I can’t sympathize (other than what the other two posts have said): you, or whoever these “others” are, make no effort to do anything with Spanish that isn’t required (to be honest, the department doesn’t make it very demanding, anyway). I’ve skipped a semester between Spanish classes TWICE in my undergraduate career, due to scheduling or lack of upper division classes – it is what it is. I practice on my own to maintain it and come back to class later right where I left off. In fact, I came back both times far better than before. And with a summer in between, don’t even try to tell me there is no time. The only time you, or these “others,” can speak of is time wasted, neglecting something that should be of interest with a degree like yours.
Essentially, it is your kind of attitude that holds students who actually care to learn another language a disadvantage in the classroom: every semester, weeks have to be taken going over the simple concepts that should already be known. The fact that people still can’t do “por” vs. “para” in even upper division classes is pathetic. Some may be the instruction, but by and far the fault belongs to people like you.
This is your fault.  As an alumnus who completed the foreign language requirement, I know what you mean, but lack any sympathy for you.  If you started at USC as a freshman, you would have had 8 semesters (and 3 or 4 summer sessions) to complete the language requirement.  You chose to wait until the last 2 semesters.  You even planned to take classes after your graduation.  This shows a complete lack of planning on your part.
I agree that the requirement is annoying and the paucity of classes makes registering difficult.  But your inability to
“crash” a class is completely of your own doing.  Instead of writing about how the Spanish department should “accommodate” you, you should have planned better, met with your adviser to discuss your current and future schedule, and taken the initiative during your registration dates.  You didn’t.  
It’s clear you have a sense of entitlement and believe you should be able to take any classes you want whenever you want.  However, this shows a complete lack of respect towards the students that meticulously plan their schedules in advance so that they can graduate on time.  Furthermore, you assume that the Spanish department can afford the increased budget of adding another class, or that they have classroom space to add another class. 
If you really wanted to graduate on time, start graduate school, or retain your Spanish skills, you would have been better at planning your courses to achieve these goals.  You didn’t and now you are out of luck. 
Fight On.
You saved your Spanish requirements for the 2nd semester of your senior year? Do you want a cookie, or what?
Hey guess what, as of noon on 1/23 (the time of this post), there are two seats open in Spanish II classes:

I can’t believe anyone would sign their name to a letter that does little more than announce to the world how bad they are at managing their schedule.

When choosing classes, it’s easy to see an interesting description and think it’s going to make for a good semester.
This thought process, however, is flawed.
An apathetic, unqualified or downright rude teacher can ruin an enticing subject, whereas a dull field of study can become a passion with the right support.

I, for example, had never considered economics as a major until an effective high school teacher showed me just how interesting supply and demand can be.
Registering for classes is no small matter — every class has the potential to change your career trajectory. Unfortunately, less than perfect information about instructors makes it difficult to know what you’re getting yourself into.
Sure, you can check RateMyProfessors.com, but a few disgruntled students can distort the image of a professor and make the ratings useless.
USC offers its own evaluation site, but it is plagued by shortcomings that make it nearly useless.
The setup is clunky and confusing. Many classes are not published because of a lack of student responses.
The feedback is too objective: teachers are rated in a variety of vague categories on a scale from one to five.
This kind of system tends to reveal little about a professor because of its structure.
A “fun” or “nice” teacher will usually get all 5’s from lazy survey-takers who enjoyed the class. A strict or demanding teacher, even one that makes class useful and relevant, is at risk of getting straight 1’s from a resentful student. This  kind of behavior skews the numbers and leads to scores that reveal little about the class itself.
To get a subjective opinion that reveals information about the class, word of mouth seems to be the only option — and word of mouth is unreliable in its own way. Though the information might be more relevant, it is just one opinion. To truly get a feel for how a class works, it’s essential to listen to more than just one person’s experience.
USC has done a fair job providing student feedback to teachers, but what about to other students?
If there were a well-crafted, relatively unbiased survey and rating system geared toward students, we would be able to choose classes more effectively. We could even put pressure on professors to make their classes more student-friendly.
This website would include the current rating system but add responses to pointed questions that require a verbal response.
Information about homework load, attendance-taking and other such factors would be a lot more helpful than knowing that a teacher gets a 3.5/5 for “organizing course to achieve goals.”
USC students are exceptionally well-connected to their community: Sites such as MyUSC and Blackboard allow instructors and students to share information about their classes and community events.
It would be simple enough to create and to implement a system in which written student evaluations could be published to a database other students could access. With some quality control to prevent responses from students who are simply holding a grudge, the system could be incredibly useful.
USC has the means to make this a reality. A restructuring of the course evaluation site could ease the stress of registration and could improve students’ class experiences.

As a Senior who has seen my fair share of bad classes (or rather, horrible professors, even in my great major), I wholeheartedly agree. Well said.
