In some ways, college is the last time that students are given absolute freedom to explore their interests. However, far too often, we are blinded by the moment, running along like racehorses with tunnel vision just trying to make it to graduation, forgetting that college is as much about the journey as it is about the piece of paper you get when you leave.
One of the biggest struggles that students face along this four-year journey is deciding what they want to study. It’s the question every college student has heard, but it is also one of the hardest to answer. At a school such as USC with over 90 majors and 150 minors, the choices seem endless. Many students often become intimidated by the prospect of changing majors too, or start to second guess themselves or feel guilty when they begin to prefer classes that challenge or excite them personally, but have no relevance to their current major or degree.
My first few semesters here, I found myself in that same struggle — counting units to see if I would graduate on time, and second guessing myself over and over when trying to decide whether or not it was worth it to add that second major or minor. Like most students, I arrived at USC majoring in what I was comfortable with. In that realm of familiarity though, I was unaware of the opportunity around me and, as it turned out, unaware of what really interested me. However, as someone who began with a single major but eventually ended with a double major and triple minor, what I realized along the way was that the moment I let go of being afraid and went for what I was interested in was the moment when college really started to open up for me. Instead of feeling like I was just going through the motions to get a degree, I found myself actually looking forward to classes because I was finally learning about what actually interested and resonated with me.
When it comes to exploring your academic interests, there really is no step-by-step guide, because everyone’s interests are different. The easy part is picking a class that appeals to you. The hard part is finding the courage to follow through. Luckily, USC’s system makes it easy to try new classes and programs with grading options such as pass/no pass and audit, and by offering summer classes to free up student’s schedules during the fall and spring. However, as with anyone trying something new, I have definitely had my share of awkward experiences, from sounding like a dying cat in an Intro to Singing course, to feeling completely out of my element in a web design workshop. However, each experience, good or bad, brought me one step closer to realizing what I did and didn’t like. Ultimately, it helped me realize exactly what I wanted to focus on in college.
Some students see it as a setback to change majors or add another program of study. However, I see it as a benefit, because it shows that you’ve grown. It shows that you’ve learned and explored, and are better off because of it. One of the greatest benefits of college is being able to add a major, switch up a minor, drop it one semester, then change your mind and pick it up again because you realized it’s exactly what you were searching for. It’s been said by some that what you learn about yourself in the process is worth more than the degree itself, and in many ways, I agree. College is where you are given absolute freedom to explore, so take advantage of the opportunity, conquer your hesitations and add that major or minor you’ve been thinking of, because more often than not, it will enrich your college experience like nothing else can.
 
Well, if you got older siblings who already went to college there’s a start; ditto for older friends. Ask them for advice and opinions. 
…But don’t be rash like people who chase a degree because they believe it’s a high paying one e.g. law, MD, and the like. You will find out it’s not all roses…nor are these easy academic journeys. I seen people do this and they’re not happy with where they are.

Before apps such as Instagram and Twitter, there were little opportunities to enter the fashion world. As social networking sites continue to gain popularity as platforms for fashion lovers, models and designers to express their artistic skill set, the rise to fame in the fashion industry now takes a different path.
Instagram has effectively altered the barriers to joining the fashion elite. Now, anyone with the app has the opportunity to easily convey his or her ideas. If you are weary to believe this, look at the front rows of any major fashion week. These rows are occupied by not only the elite gatekeepers of internationally acclaimed fashion such as Karl Lagerfeld and Vogue’s Anna Wintour, but also the models and designers who used Instagram to gain a wide following.
Once you feel exhausted from the Instagram feeds of Lily Aldridge, Cara Delevingne and Gigi Hadid, you should turn to these rising models and designers whose fame has catapulted due to the popular photo-sharing app:
1. Blaire Eadie (@blaireadiebee)

For the past few years, many of the entertainment award shows have received extensive criticism over the lack of diversity in the representation of both nominees and winners. 
A week ago, at the Grammys award show, there was, once again, a huge overhaul of white artists. Album of the Year went to Taylor Swift for 1989. The title of Best New Artist is now held by Meghan Trainor, and Song of the Year was Ed Sheeran’s “Thinking Out Loud.” The top three spots easily taken by white pop artists. But who were they up against? Album of the Year could have totally gone to the Kendrick Lamar’s arguably more well-deserved record To Pimp a Butterfly or The Weeknd’s Beauty Behind the Madness. Likewise, Song of the Year could have gone to a more diverse artist –– Kendrick Lamar, who took a nomination in almost every top category in which he was eligible (11 in total).
Though diversity was found in genres such as R&B, rap, soul and gospel, the real issue is recognizing diversity within the realm of popular radio music culture. R&B, rap, soul and gospel were all born out of largely black communities, with some roots tracing all the way back to traditional African music. Mainstream music however,  is still largely dominated by white people, a fact grounded in an old generational representation in popular culture. Despite the fact that popular music, especially at award shows is seemingly an “all white” wash-up, Business Insider reports that 81 percent of Billboard’s Top 10 albums are now made by non-white or mixed race groups, but that number doesn’t seem to be represented at award shows like the Grammys. 
Similarly, next Sunday, the Oscars will be presenting another racially charged scenario for voters of the entertainment industry. Interestingly enough, all actors and actresses up for best actor, actress or supporting role is white. In the past we have had winners such as Lupita Nyongo, Jennifer Hudson and Jamie Foxx, but this year, for the second time in a row, there is little to no cultural diversity. 
It’s important to recognize this issue, to break down the racial stigmas that have ruled the entertainment world since the beginning of time. As we’ve seen, in all realms of entertainment there are diversity issues despite the fact that there are millions of incredibly talented singers, musicians, directors and actors who are not white. Bringing to light the obvious lack of racial diversity within the entertainment industry will hopefully underscore the importance of encouraging and giving due recognition to artists of all backgrounds in all arenas of the entertainment world.

Utah forward Jakob Poeltl scored 29 points with 13 rebounds and four assists and guard Brandon Taylor chipped in 8 points and 10 assists as the Utes defeated the USC Trojans 80-69 on Sunday. The loss was the Trojans’ first home defeat of the season.
“I’m proud of our team’s effort, winning 15 straight games at home.” head coach Andy Enfield said. “Unfortunately tonight we got outplayed and lost to a good basketball team.”
Guard Jordan McLaughlin led the Trojans (19-8, 8-6) with 20 points, three assists and three rebounds as the Trojans lost at the Galen Center for the first time in almost a year. Fellow backcourt mate Julian Jacobs finished with 17 points, three rebounds and two assists.
The Utes (21-7, 10-5) outrebounded the Men of Troy 30-24 and outscored them 38-28 in the paint. The Trojans shot 58 percent from 3-point range, but attempted just 17 shots. The Utes finished shooting 53 percent from the field and had 13 second-chance points. The Utes also attempted nine more free throws than the Trojans.
Both teams came out running in the first half. The Utes immediately took advantage of their size down low with Poeltl. The second year big man from Austria scored nine of the Utes first 14 points and finished the half with a near double-double.
The backcourt duo of McLaughlin and Jacobs scored the first 13 points for the Trojans. The Trojans were able to stay relatively close throughout the first half, but once Poeltl returned the Utes closed on a run to push their lead to double digits.
Guard Katin Reinhardt hit a 3-pointer to beat the halftime buzzer to cut the Utes lead to 10 at the half. The Trojans had 10 first half turnovers that turned into 15 points for the Utes. McLaughlin, Jacobs and forward Bennie Boatwright combined for 25 of the Trojans 30 first half points.
It looked like things were going to get away from the Trojans as the Utes opened the second half by hitting back-to-back 3-pointers, extending their lead to 16 points.
Jacobs had other plans. The third-year guard scored nine points in a flurry that helped ignite a 14-3 run by the Men of Troy. The Trojans got as close as 5 points, before the Utes woke up.
Poeltl scored eight of Utah’s next 12 points as the Utes pushed their lead back to double-digits. The Trojans had a late rally that cut the lead back to 10, but they would get no closer.
 
The Men of Troy made a spirited comeback but the size of Poeltl ended up being too much the Trojans to handle. Poeltl killed the Trojans inside but also opened up wide open shots for his teammates as USC was forced to double down on various occasions. All eight of the Utes players scored at least four points.
 
“He’s a pro if I’ve ever seen one. He absolutely dominated us.” Jacobs said. “We did not have an answer for him. Defensively, I think he ended with four steals. Offensively he had his way with us. It was the Jakob Poeltl show, and we did not have any answers.”
 
Forward Darian Clark missed his fourth consecutive game with a shoulder injury. As one of USC’s toughest defenders and rebounders, he was sorely missed as the Trojans struggled against the size of Poeltl.
 
“The teams were playing right now are very physical.” Enfield said. “Darian is our best rebounder per minute, so we definitely miss him. However, our players need to pick up the slack until Darian can get back.”
 
The trio of McLaughlin, Jacobs, and Boatwright scored 54 of the Trojans 69 points. The rest of the Trojans went 6-20 from the field for 15 points.
With the loss, the Trojans now sit two game behind league leaders Arizona and Oregon. The Trojans have a big trip coming up against Stanford and Cal. The Golden Bears are one game ahead of the Trojans in the standings.
 
“We feel like we’re right there.” McLaughlin said. “We have a few things to get better at, but we feel like we’re right there.”
 
The Trojans are back in action this Thursday at 8 PM against the Stanford Cardinal. The game will be aired on the Pac-12 networks.

USC baseball fans who packed Dedeaux Field all weekend long to enjoy their first tastes of hot dogs, peanuts, and this highly anticipated team – ranked No. 12 in the nation – witnessed the Trojans’ first win of season on Sunday in walk-off fashion after the team lost its first two in a three-game series against North Dakota.
USC players rushed to home plate to celebrate after a ninth inning single by senior designated hitter Timmy Robinson drove in the game-winning run for his first hit of the season. The Trojans recorded their first win of the season behind a strong five inning performance from junior pitcher Barnardo Flores. Flores allowed seven hits and 4 runs, 3 in the fifth.
“That was nice,” said Robinson, who missed all regional practice games and saw his first live at-bats this series due to an injury. “That was relieving. I need to just keep that in my mind. I just need to keep going back to that and remember how that felt and take that in with every at bat with a positive attitude.”
After struggling from the plate in their first two games, the Men of Troy responded with their most hits of the season with 11 Sunday.
To contrast, USC struggled from the plate Friday, collecting three hits in its opening game that featured a matchup between both clubs’ strongest pitchers, and four hits on Saturday. Head coach Dan Hubbs credited North Dakota pitcher Zach Muckenhirn – who allowed 3 hits and remained in the game all nine innings Friday – for his ability to throw the ball high in the strike zone, causing his players to constantly get contact but fly out.  The Trojans, who lost 1-0, remained largely competitive as a result of senior starting pitcher Kyle Davis, who threw eight innings, allowing five hits.
“You are going to win some and you are going to lose some in close games and when a guy is on a roll, he can shut you down,” Hubbs said, “Whether he was doing a great job of heightening the ball or whether we were having trouble deciphering whether the ball was up or down, the whole focus was to get a ball down in the zone to hit and we did not execute that.”
In addition to losing 30 pounds in preparation for the season, Davis said that he has worked tirelessly with Coach Hubbs on his two-seamer pitch since the fall. Though Davis is known for his curveball and four-seamer, he noted that his strong eight-inning performance was a testament to the new pitch that allows him to accumulate easy outs from fly rather than ground balls. Davis struck out 10 North Dakota hitters who Coach Hubbs described as “really aggressive” and “swinging a ton,” but admitted that the Hawks were able to capitalize on one of his few mistakes in the game when North Dakota’s Miles Lewis scored a runner off a two-seamer which he left high.
Davis, who was pleased with his performance in the season’s first game because he kept his team competitive, is confident that his teammates will create hits and learn to play in the framework of the team in order to accomplish their individual goals.
“Personally, I want to be Pac-12 pitcher of the year,” Davis said. “I want to be an All-American. I want to do everything I possibly can, so I am pretty excited for the season.”
On Saturday, the Trojans fell 5-4, failing to tie the game late despite a rally in the bottom of the ninth.
Hubbs, Robinson, and junior catcher Jeremy Martinez all mentioned that the Trojan team plays its best when they are relaxed and having fun. Each said that the team might have had jitters in their opening games but hope that this first win will allow players to exhale and better prepare for their highly anticipated season.
“As long as we play our game we are going to do fine,” Martinez said. “We know there are going to be close ball games that you can win or lose, so you can never be too happy to take a win. But every win we take this year we are going to be happy, whether they are the one-run games or the 10-run games. We just need to keep improving and hopefully we can take it into the playoffs at the end of the year.”

What a difference one year makes. On Jan. 29, 2015, the USC men’s basketball team took on the Colorado Buffaloes in a three-overtime thriller that unfortunately ended in a loss. Up until the Arizona epic earlier this season, it was the most exciting game I had seen the Trojans play.
In that game, current redshirt junior guard Katin Reinhardt was automatic with his feet set from deep, and current junior forward  Nikola Jovanovic dominated the post with an array of moves that he has further improved upon this season. The game offered a glimpse of the pace and space style coach Andy Enfield envisioned his Trojan squad. While the team didn’t turn a corner that game, on account of some poor late game decisions and abysmal free throw shooting, they demonstrated the kind of potential that Enfield’s system had in the Pac-12 conference.
One year later, and the Trojans have transformed more than even Optimus Prime could have expected. They are right on the periphery of the top 25, and they are a dark horse candidate to make a deep run into the NCAA tournament. Even better, the Trojans are nearly unbeatable on their home court, suffering just their first home loss of the season Sunday to Utah.
While all of this is incredible and exciting to watch the birth of a new program under Enfield, one has to look no further than the win against Colorado to comprehend the tremendous progress and growth the team has made.
Against Colorado on Wednesday night, the Trojans were down 15 late in the second half. They looked listless and lifeless, sleepwalking through a very crucial game. After years and years of Trojan basketball, I am conditioned to expect the worst. Going 0-2 on the road against the Sun Devils and Wildcats, and then getting blown out on their home court by Colorado didn’t project well for the rest of the season.
I imagined the worst: a total collapse, followed by a loss against Utah to mark a four-game skid, and then losses to end the season against the team’s  last four opponents. Instead what I saw at the Galen Center Wednesday was resilience and persistence and an acumen in game coaching adjustment by Enfield that may have changed the trajectory of this season and possibly the program.
Instead of folding down 15, Enfield switched to a 2-3 zone that stymied the Buffaloes and helped to compensate for the Trojans inferiority on defense. USC used this zone and some stellar guard play from sophomore Jordan McLaughlin and junior  Julian Jacobs to go on a 20-5 run and tie the game at 65 apiece.
The Trojans had an eerily similar experience against the Buffaloes last season. They were down 61-50 and came back to tie the game 66 all and send it into overtime.  This year and in this game, the Trojans demonstrated that they have indeed turned the corner.
Unlike last season, in which the Trojans couldn’t contain Colorado guard Askia Booker and McLaughlin struggled down the stretch from the free throw line, this year the roles were reversed. McLaughlin and Jacobs were unstoppable in the final moments, playing frenetic defense and hitting from all over the court.
Colorado was the team that couldn’t score, and struggled from the free throw line. Instead of failing to land a knockout punch as the team did last season, and ultimately wilting in the third overtime, USC went for the jugular this season and won in regulation by a score of 79-72. Crisis averted, season intact.
USC may not win the conference this year — although they still very well could — but the game against Colorado offered incontrovertible proof that this is a team to fear. USC had shown they can get out to early leads and blow teams out. Now they have shown that they can from behind and finish the job. That is the mark of a well-coached team. They still need to improve their play in close battles, as they have a tendency to get tight, but that comes with experience.
No one expected the Trojans to be this good this soon. It has been an utter delight watching them play, and Wednesday was one of the most inspiring games I have seen in the last fourteen years of watching the team. It may not be as significant as Daniel Hackett shutting down Kevin Durant to beat Texas in the NCAA tournament or coming back against James Harden and the Sun Devils to win the then-Pac 10 tournament, but Wednesday’s win was monumental for the Enfield era.
The win against Arizona earlier this year proved that USC could beat the big boys. Now it’s clear they deserve to play with them night in and night out. Enfield made a coaching adjustment that won the game, which is improvement from a young, sharp coach who is building a winning program. It’s rare to be this optimistic about USC basketball this late in season, and boy does it feel good. The Trojans are back on the hardwood, and they are a force to be reckoned with.

Coming off a decisive victory against Utah  Saturday to close out the regular season, the USC men’s swimming team is poised to defend its Pac-12 conference championship crown.
The Utes (1-7, 0-3 Pac-12) were up against a tough opponent in the Trojans (9-1, 4-1), who had only dropped one dual meet coming into the weekend. It may have been Senior Night in Salt Lake City, but it turned out to be USC’s crop of young stars who owned the day.
Sophomore standout Ralf Tribuntsov led the charge for USC, winning both the 100-yard backstroke and 100-yard butterfly to score huge point totals for his team. Before capturing victories in his solo events, he set the tone with a strong opening in the day’s first event: the 200-yard medley relay. Alongside a trio of talented freshmen, Carsten Vissering, Alex Velante and Kyle Grissom, Tribuntsov helped the Trojans to a winning time of 1:28:28.
“This is always a tough venue to compete in,” head coach Dave Salo said of the Ute Natatorium, Utah’s 43-year-old swim complex. “I’m really proud of the effort on the part of the freshmen again stepping up and racing hard … Ralf again held his own in the fly and back.”
Vissering followed his efforts in the relay with a razor-thin victory in the 100-yard breaststroke — his time of 55.42 was just 0.02 seconds faster than Utah sophomore Jack Burton. Trojan junior Steven Stumph finished third, helping his team’s overall point total.
Valente also won the 200-yard butterfly after being edged out by Tribuntsov’s “B”-cut (and USC’s season record) time in the 100-yard butterfly. USC senior captain Ted Singley followed closely behind, touching the wall just 0.08 seconds after Valente.
The Trojan freshmen continued to impress, as Grissom, Patrick Mulcare and Tim Wynter would win the 50-yard freestyle, 100-yard freestyle and 200-yard backstroke, respectively. Stumph joined the party of USC’s first-place finishers with his win in the 200-yard breaststroke, and the Trojan quartet of Wynter, sophomore Jon Knox, Valente and junior Michael Domagala bookended the day with a win in the 400-yard freestyle relay.
On the diving board, USC seniors Deon Reid and Collin Pollard placed second and third on the 1-meter, and senior Dashiell Enos notched USC’s top finish on the 3-meter.
With Saturday’s victory, the Trojans finish the regular season with just one blemish on their record: a November loss to now-17th ranked Arizona in Tucson. Incidentally, USC has beaten two teams currently ranked ahead of them: No. 2 California and No. 8 Stanford. Both of those victories came earlier this month at home in the Uytengsu Aquatics Center, and it’s a good bet that the Trojans will face off against both squads again in the Pac-12 Conference Championships.
With the regular season now concluded, the Trojans will focus all of their efforts to the postseason, where they hope to defend their title. The swimming championships will begin on Mar. 2  in Federal Way, Washington and the diving championships will take place Mar. 9-11.

The Women of Troy suffered a sweep in Oregon over the weekend, falling to Oregon State Friday and Oregon Sunday.
On Sunday, the Trojans (18-10, 6-10)  threatened with a run in the fourth quarter, but the Ducks survived in the end for a 69-60 win. USC cut a 15-point deficit down to just two with under two minutes to play, but Oregon (20-7, 9-7)  finished the game on a 9-2 run as the Trojans ran out of gas.
Sophomore forward Kirsten Simon led the way for USC with 19 points, while junior guard Courtney Jaco chipped in 11.
Up by six at halftime, Oregon pulled away in the third quarter, opening up a double-digit advantage as USC was held in check on offense, being outscored by the Ducks 43-21 over the second and third frames. The Trojans trailed 52-37 heading into the fourth.
The Trojans opened the game strong, leading 16-9 after the first quarter, going on a 7-2 run that was capped off by a bank shot from senior forward Fagenble off a pass by freshman guard Khaedin Taito.
But USC was outscored 23-10 in the second quarter, with a 9-2 run quickly evening the score at 18-18 after a 3-pointer by senior guard Lexi Peterson. The Ducks took the lead shortly thereafter. Freshman Maite Cazorla, who led all scorers at halftime with 14 points on 7-of-10 shooting, put Oregon ahead 32-26 at halftime after making a layup with just over a minute left in the half.
The Women of Troy entered the game having lost three of their last four games, including a 76-52 defeat at Oregon State Friday night.
In a fourth quarter that was not competitive, the Women of Troy were unable to cut into the lead with the Beavers continuing their hot shooting into the fourth quarter. The Beavers extended the lead to a game-high 27 on a 3-pointer by Taylor Kalmer with two minutes remaining in the fourth quarter.
The Trojans struggled offensively to start the game but they were able to keep things close with their aggressive defense and relentless hustle. After trailing throughout the first quarter, the Women of Troy were able to tie the game with two minutes remaining in the quarter on a tough layup by sophomore guard Sadie Edwards. It was an ugly first quarter with both teams shooting below 30 percent and finishing with a meager nine points.
The action picked up in the second quarter with both teams shooting the ball much better. USC took its first and only lead of the game on its first possession of the second quarter on a put-back by Fagbenle. But the Beavers quickly responded with an 8-0 run, including back-to-back 3-pointers by senior Deven Hunger and freshman Taylor Kalmer to take a 17-13 lead. The Women of Troy were unable to muster up a run of their own and finished the half trailing 29-23.
It was a tough game for the Women of Troy as they suffered their largest loss of the season. The team not only had trouble on offense but they also struggled on the defensive end as Oregon State’s ball movement left USC scrambling.
“We’ve got to get back to our basics of playing defense and running,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said. “We’ve got to be able to execute our game-plan for 40 minutes.”
The Trojans return home to take on Arizona State on Friday at the Galen Center.
Recruiting of the foreign players has been counter- productive. What a waste of the freshman. Head Coach Cooper-Dyke has not  been the answer for this program. Losing two players to academics that have already graduated has got to be a first.

No. 1 USC, which took its place at the top of the rankings after last weekend’s Triton Invitational, continued to dominate in the pool, winning 15-3 over CSU Northridge in Saturday’s game at the Utengysu Aquatic Center.
After toppling UCLA 8-6 in the final round of last week’s Triton Invitational, USC became the last MPSF team to remain undefeated with a perfect 6-0 heading into Saturday’s game, where the Trojans took their record to 7-0.
The Trojans took a commanding lead against CSUN in the first quarter with 2 hat trick goals for junior attacker Stephania Haralibidis and 2 more from sophomores Hayley Mckelvey and Brianna Daboub, taking advantage of open water to convert goals. While the offense was tallying up the scoreboard, the Trojan defense kept the Matadors to just one goal for the entire first half with four saves from freshman goalkeeper Amanda Longan in the first quarter alone.
In the second quarter, the Trojan offense began teeing off on the Matadors putting away 4 more goals from McKelvey, Jensen, Brigitta Games, Ioanna Haralibidis and Brianna Daboub. In the cage, Longan had a quarter shutout with three more saves to bring her total to seven by the end of the first half.
The action continued in the second half with a pair of hat trick goals from the Haralibidis duo — Stephania and Ioanna — accompanied by goals from senior Melissa Bergesen and juniors Avery Peterson and Brigitta Games. By the end of the third quarter, Longan brought her total to 13 saves, a career high for her debut season thus far.
Senior Alegra Hueso took over the cage in the fourth quarter to keep the Matadors at just 3 goals for the duration of the game. On offense, Stephania Haralibidis converted her 4th goal of the day bringing the final score to 15-3.
“Being named MPSF newcomer shows that people are paying attention to all the hard work we put in. It’s very encouraging going forward into the season,” said Longan, who was awarded the MPSF Newcomer Award last week averaging 6.4 saves per game in 10 periods of play.
“In preparation for the UCI tournament next weekend, we will be working hard in practice,” said top scorer of the game Stephania Haralibidis, who won the MPSF Player of the Week for her work in the UC San Diego Tournament. “It’s important that we have good communication and trust because we love each other as a team and can do great things if we keep working together.”
On Feb. 27-28, the Trojans will travel to Irvine to play in the UCI Invitational where they expect to rematch against top-ranked MPSF teams.

Show Me a Hero and The Big Short both took home awards at the 28th Annual Scripter Awards, where USC honored the best film and television episode adaptations of novels. The event was held at Doheny Memorial Library Saturday evening.
This was the first year that the Scripter Awards included a separate award category for television episodes along with the feature films. Nearly 80 shows were considered by the selection committee, almost as many feature films were considered.
“We look for great writing, and an adaptation that is both innovative and faithful,” said Howard A. Rodman, chair of the Scripter Selection Committee. “We all felt that so much great writing was being done in television that it would be wrong for us to overlook it.”
The first-ever Scripter Award for the best adapted television episode was won this year by Lisa Belkin, William Zorzi and David Simon, novelist and screenwriter for the HBO miniseries Show Me a Hero. Zorzi traced the process of taking Belkin’s novel and making it a screenplay while Belkin expressed her satisfaction with the way the television episode reflected her novel.
“[British novelist] John Le Carré supposedly said that watching your book become a film is like watching your oxen be turned into beef jerky,” Belkin said during her speech. “But it was not like that at all. And it was because the people behind the adaptation were respectful and loving of both the written word and its history.”
The other nominees were screenwriters David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, for the episode “Hardhome” from Game of Thrones, adapted from the fantasy series by George R. R. Martin; Damon Lindelof and Jacqueline Hoyt for the episode “Axis Mundi” from The Leftovers, based on the novel by Tom Perrotta; Frank Spotnitz for the episode “The New World” from The Man in the High Castle, based on the novel by Philip K. Dick; Michelle Ashford, for the episode “Full Ten Count” from Masters of Sex, based on the novel by Thomas Maier.
Tara Shivkumar, a sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television, believed that adding a new category for the Scripter Awards reflected the increasing value of television as a medium for storytelling.
“I think it’s really important that they include television because it’s started doing the things that film is afraid of doing,” Shivkumar said. “Television has so much more diversity than film; it pushes boundaries in the way film doesn’t. Film tells the same stories over and over … But television is branching out from that and making these really complex characters that you can just follow.”
The Scripter Award for best adapted screenplay was presented after television episodes, with Adam McKay and Charles Randolph, screenwriters for The Big Short, taking the award.
For Randolph, the inspiration for The Big Short screenplay came from a frustration with the function of money in American society during the 2008 housing bubble.
“I was pretty unhappy with not just how our economy took a hit, but also the fact that there seemed to be no repercussions for anyone,” Randolph said. “Some of the worst actors walked away with the most to gain from it … Also it was a challenge: There’s something fascinating about taking on a really abstract idea.”
During the acceptance speech, McKay talked briefly about the importance of writing when it came to screenplays and entertainment, thanking Michael Lewis for writing a novel that he “bought at 9 p.m. and didn’t put down until 6:30 in the morning.” McKay also mentioned the library as an essential place to slow people down from everyday life and help them think. Randolph continued with McKay’s sentiment, drawing on his own personal experiences at USC.
“I wrote my first script in [Doheny],” Randolph said during his acceptance speech. “In this space that filled me with the sense of the importance of order [and] the importance of ideas, which are both invaluable.”
The other nominees for the award were screenwriter Nick Hornby for Brooklyn, based on the novel by Colm Tóibín, screenwriter Donald Margulies for The End of the Tour, adapted from David Lipsky’s memoir Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself: A Road Trip with David Foster Wallace; novelist Andy Weir and screenwriter Drew Goddard for The Martian and Emma Donoghue for the novel and screenplay of Room.
The selection committee is made up of 50 people, including Hollywood writers, producers, certain members and associates of USC Libraries, film critics and former winners, including last year’s Scripter Awards winner Graham Moore, screenwriter for The Imitation Game. The committee compiles a list of five eligible films and television episodes and then selects the winners through a second round of voting.
For Rodman, a good adaptation is both innovative and faithful to the original piece.
“Books are the single best medium that I know for getting inside people’s heads, an act forbidden to screenwriters who can only rely on what can be seen and what can be heard,” Rodman said. “A great adaptation elevates more than it betrays, sharpens more than it forces, brings more than it leaves behind … It brings the book to a new audience.”

The USC chapter of Pi Tau Sigma, a mechanical engineering honors society, hosted the 101st annual national convention from Feb. 19-21, the first time this event was ever hosted at USC.
The event featured business meetings, panel discussions, trainings, competitions and keynote addresses. Apart from these, a career fair was also organized as a part of the three-day event. The convention saw the participation of more than 250 mechanical engineering graduate students, all from different chapters of the society across United States. The theme of the convention was “The Role of Entrepreneurship and Innovation on Modern Engineering.”
“We are kicking off a new century here,” said Stephen Wilson, president of the USC chapter. “It gives us an opportunity, as a local chapter, to share our University and our research. Our goal as the hosting chapter is to network with all the mechanical engineering departments across the country.”
Wilson emphasized the need for fostering innovation. The convention hosted small and new schools in addition to larger, older institutions.
Mun Young Choi, president of the National Honor Society, began proceedings at the USC Radisson Hotel Grand Ballroom by delivering the introduction to the society and taking a roll call of all the participating chapters. It was followed by a welcome speech by Yannis C. Yortos, dean of Viterbi School of Engineering, in which he talked about the role of innovation and entrepreneurship for the modern engineer. He defined technology as exploitation of a physical phenomenon for useful purpose and explained how it evolves exponentially and digitally.
“Problems are inevitable; all problems are solvable,” Yortos said. “As engineers, we not only solve problems, but we also create opportunities for the betterment of the world, and that is something the chapter needs to change.”
National Secretary-Treasurer Alex Moutsoglou from South Dakota State University and co-Vice President at Large Altaf Khan opened the floor for a think tank in which delegates discussed and debated on the representation of women in the male-dominated mechanical engineering society and the need to introduce engineering to more women across the country. Other issues discussed were funding and traditions followed by individual chapters. Students also questioned a proposed amendment on the admissions policy of the society.
Head Convention Coordinator Buck McKay said that Southern California’s status as a hub for mechanical engineering made it an ideal location to work through problems in the industry.
“Southern California, or Silicon Beach as we call it, has now become a mecca for this,” McKay said. “We are trying to resound that theme and get people excited to use this to launch into innovative pursuits and use these networking to generate ideas for startups.”
The next day saw a mix of various events starting with a panel discussion on the theme by Greg Autry, assistant professor of clinical entrepreneurship at the Marshall School of Business, and Behrokh Khoshnevis, a professor of industrial and systems engineering. There was also a student competition sponsored by Autodesk and a lab tour.
Mauritz deRidder, principal engineer of propulsion at Virgin Galactic, delivered the keynote address in which he introduced his organization’s strategy of developing the world’s first spaceline tourism. In his speech, he addressed the three encouraging reasons of pursuing an engineer’s life.
“Make sure everyone is successful around you, set your goals high and push as hard as possible and do not be defined by your failures,” deRidder said. “Many of you are dreamers — you stare skywards and you see endless possibilities. That will make you a good innovator, but more importantly, it will make you a good engineer.”
He also answered many questions from the students on the significance of innovation in an engineer’s life. Ellie Ballad, a graduating senior from California Maritime Academy, said that attending the event made her want to be a better mechanical engineer.
“I had no idea of the magnitude of Pi Tau Sigma,” Ballad said. “It encourages and empowers me with my own work as a mechanical engineer. It gives me a sense of pride in my work.”
Drexel University in Philadelphia will host the convention next year.

A fleeting sound caused by the gravitational waves from merging black holes has proven that collisions create a ripple in space-time across a billion light-years of distance. USC’s Information Sciences Institute played a crucial role in the discovery that was announced on Feb. 11 by creating a program called Pegasus that helped more than a thousand researchers from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory at Caltech organize their data.
“We all feel immensely proud,” said Karan Vahi, the lead developer of Pegasus. “[We’re] glad to see all the years spent getting the pipelines up and working through Pegasus come to fruition.”
Ewa Deelman, a research associate professor in the computer science department, designed Pegasus to help more than 1,000 researchers working on the project to collaborate more effectively. Pegasus is a scientific workflow management system, providing researchers a program to work on multi-computational tasks such as retrieving data from an instrument or a database, reformatting data and running analyses.
“It was 2001 … the goal was to develop a ‘Virtual Data Grid’ for LIGO and other science applications,” Deelman said. “In 2011, LIGO passed the ‘blind injection’ test, using Pegasus. This test proved that the analysis being developed by LIGO could detect a gravitational wave.”
The process of discovering gravitational waves involved using two interferometers which utilize lasers and mirrors to measure displacements in electromagnetic waves — one at LIGO and the other with the Virgo Collaboration near Pisa, Italy. Pegasus helped analyze and sort the noise coming from the interferometers; then, once the noises were detected, it provided a way to measure whether they were significant enough to consider for deeper analysis.
“LIGO and Virgo had written computer codes to produce automated alerts and send emails for interesting candidates,” Vahi said. “The crew that was watching the alerts … reacted fast to start the needed actions to confirm it. As part of this validation process, LIGO/Virgo scientists used [an] analysis pipeline to measure the statistical significance of the detection.”
Gravitational waves from two merging black holes, neutron stars or other massive objects would produce a chirping sound. The small chirping noises may not seem like much, but to put their magnitude into perspective, supernovae or gamma ray bursts (like solar flares) produce crackling noises. The oldest gravitational waves, such as those from the Big Bang, are significantly less loud in comparison.
Pegasus has been involved with LIGO since 2001, when both groups became part of a National Science Foundation-funded project to explore the use of workflow technologies to run large-scale science pipelines on computational grids. In 2010, LIGO and Virgo decided to collaborate on developing common analysis pipelines to analyze data coming out of their respective detectors, a process that led to February’s discovery.
According to Vahi, the affirmation of black holes by LIGO has been one of the most challenging applications for Pegasus in terms of complexity, the size of data, number of files required and the number of jobs run to do analysis.
“The most rewarding part of the process has been to see techniques developed put in production use by real users,” Vahi said. “Pegasus started as a research project and its use by LIGO and other applications have enabled us transform it into a production-quality software that scientists can rely on.”

The USCxCommunity Block Party brought together the student body and members of the community Sunday in Hahn Plaza. Organized by the Undergraduate and Graduate Student Governments, the free event aimed to provide participants with an afternoon of food, games, entertainment and more.
Brianna Thorpe, USG director of community affairs, has been preparing for the jam-packed day with her committee since last October.
“We’ve been working hard on the Block Party for several months now,” Thorpe said. “It’s actually been a huge learning curve for me since this is a new role we had for Advocacy, but Program Board has given me tremendous support with putting in paperwork, figuring out how to send in expense and publicity requests and other logistics.”
Thorpe has also used her connections in the community to recruit local vendors and artists to help out with the event.
“I’ve lived in South Los Angeles for around five years, right on Central and 33rd, so many of the people coming to the Block Party are actually connections I have in the community,” Thorpe said.
The event took place from 12-3 p.m. Among those Thorpe invited to the event were Zumba instructor Bianca Miyazaki-Jovel, spoken word artist Azmera Davis, the Multicultural Greek Council, and Councilman Curren D. Price Jr.
Bianca Miyazaki taught a Zumba class at 1 p.m. for an enthusiastic crowd of dancers.
“I’ve been teaching Zumba at USC for four years now, and I’m one of only two official Zumba ambassadors in the state of California,” Miyazaki said. “This is actually the first time I’ve worked with USG, and I’m so happy to contribute to such a great event for the community.”
Besides the featured Zumba class, music and dance performances and guest appearance, there were also raffles, face painting, a bounce house and free food.
Alexander Garcia, a USC Hospitality worker, said he found out about the Block Party just yesterday.
“I happened to see a flyer by chance and thought it would be a great opportunity to bring my family,” Garcia said. “My 8-year-old daughter Jada comes with me to USC events all the time.”
USG Senior Director of Communications Rachel Thundat was part of the marketing effort that went into spreading the word about the Block Party.
“For USC students, we created a Facebook page, contacted residential advisors and student leaders and posted on different organizations,” Thundat said. “For the community, we emailed different departments such as Student Affairs and the School of Social Work, who have connections in the local neighborhoods and asked them to forward the information.”
USCxCommunity Block Party is intended to not only benefit the surrounding neighborhoods, but also to raise students’ awareness of the community.
“At school, we exist in a bubble, and sometimes we forget to step out of our bubble and interact with others,” Thorpe said. “I hope the Block Party allows people to reach out and become friends with those they normally wouldn’t have the chance to meet. Understanding each other starts with interacting, and that’s what we’re doing here.”

Smiles Café and Dean’s List Eatery & Café are not your average cafes. They were created by a USC student with a vision to change the world.
Jesse Rubio, a junior majoring in international relations global business, is the owner of both Smiles Café and Dean’s List Eatery & Café. Smiles Café, located at the USC Caruso Catholic Center, was his first business, opening in September 2014. Dean’s List Eatery & Café, Rubio’s most recent project, opened last month.
Located on 34th Street under the United University Church, Dean’s List is open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekdays and 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekends, providing a study space for students.
Smiles Café is located on 32nd Street, one block away from campus. In addition to being places for students to get coffee or a snack while studying, the cafes were created to give back to the community, according to Rubio.
Both cafes participate in the Community Partnership Program, which helps promote organizations through fundraising. Each participating organization has a jar in the cafes, and customers can put their receipts in these jars. Then, a percentage of that sale goes toward the organization.
“Our partnerships can help fund awareness for the missions of these organizations,” Rubio said.
Rubio said he wants to eventually spread this philanthropic mission to other business owners.
“I want to get the word out to understand that, if businesses really want to increase their fundraising efforts, they can,” Rubio said.
Rubio’s efforts to give back to the community do not end here. On Monday and Friday mornings, Dean’s List feeds 30 homeless people and allows them to take showers. On Wednesday nights, the cafe serves free food to USC students. In doing this, Rubio said he intends to feed those who do not have enough money to eat. In addition, on Saturdays, Dean’s List provides food to the 30 to 40 “Peace Kids” who come to USC to get leadership training.
Smiles Cafe’s first two partnerships were with Troy Camp and the USC Helenes. The cafe raised over $1,000  for Troy Camp, and Rubio said this inspired him to become involved with the organization. He said one of his goals is for people to become familiar with the organizations that the cafes partner with.
Rubio said his passion for pursuing his dreams drives the success of his businesses.
“How can a business change the world? How can the way we do business change the world? That’s my key inspiration,” Rubio said.
Each cafe’s environment is another factor that sets it apart. Dean’s List plays a different movie every day and  seeks to provide a home-like atmosphere, and both cafes also have live music for students to enjoy on certain nights.
Rubio said he prides himself on the cafe’s hospitality.
“The employees greet each customer with a smile,” Rubio said. “We want to make every single guest feel appreciated and supported in the goals they pursue.”
Going forward, Rubio said he has wants to connect the impact the Trojan family can have to the world at large.
“My goal for the future of the cafes is to create an environment that welcomes the entire Trojan community,” Rubio said. “We want to be an emblem that supports the amazing changes our USC organizations do in this world.”

Los Angeles got a taste of Coachella and a preview of HARD summer at the Fonda Theatre on Saturday night with a sold-out show featuring Ganz, Hermitude and Keys N Krates. Both Ganz and Hermitude performed at the sold-out HARD summer festival in Fairplex, Calif., last year and are rumored to be featured in the 2016 festival.
All expressed excitement to return to Los Angeles, as Ganz is from the Netherlands, Hermitude are native to Australia and Keys N Krates are from Ontario, Canada.  Ganz, a relatively new producer, is known for his popular remixes of songs from Alison Wonderland, What So Not and RL Grime — all of which he featured in his set on Saturday.
Famous Australian duo, Hermitude, brought all of their newest songs to the table and featured “The Buzz,” “Through the Roof,” “Searchlight” and “Hyperparadise.” With momentum from Ganz and Hermitude, Keys N Krates joined the stage for the final performance. The trio utilized the most of the visual background set-up intertwined with lights and other interactive features.
The trio, set to tour across North America for the next month, developed a cohesive mixture of electro hip-hop tracks throughout the night with each performance bringing the crowd to their feet. As expected, the trio brought different elements to the show including visual set-ups, live piano and drum performances and fresh remixes.
Despite a few technical glitches, Ganz maintained the rush among the crowd with his high energy and tenacity. He kicked off the show with the most popular mixes from What So Not featuring drops mixed into “Arrows,” and “Oddity,” as well as Odesza and Drake. His most recent single “Gaobear” is featured in his first EP, which will be released in the spring.
Hermitude joined the performance for the second set promising a different pace of beats and began with tracks from their latest album Dark Night Sweet Light and their 2012 album HyperParadise. As promised, the duo brought out a detached piano and spin table so they could join the crowd in movement to their tropically inspired Australian tracks such as “Through the Roof” and “All of You.”
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Luke “Dubs” Dubber, explained that the mixture of both Australian and American music influences has allowed them to maintain the dynamism of their albums.
“Australia went from looking abroad for new sound to creating a new sound and now everyone is looking here for a fresh new sound,” Dubber said. “It’s been amazing to be a part of that.”
Dubber said that he would encourage new producers to focus on having their own sound. Hermitude underwent many changes and road bumps before reaching their final product for The Buzz, which sits at No. 2 in the Shazam charts in Australia and remains at the top of the charts popular among radio stations in America.
The show featured a full live setup and visual gears, making the night aesthetically pleasing and unforgettable.

Although I normally talk about women in film, I’m veering off a little bit this week to talk about women in television.
HBO’s famously infamous (or maybe, infamously famous) Girls, premiered the first episode of its fifth season on Sunday. This isn’t a review of the season premiere — rather it’s an exploration of precisely what Girls did for us viewers (and also creators) back at home.
Lena Dunham’s brainchild premiered in spring 2012, and audiences nationwide had pretty much never seen anything like it. Of course, there was CBS’ 2 Broke Girls which debuted in September 2011, but that show read as much of the same basic network comedy that we all have come to expect of the last decade or so — as great network comedies like Frasier, Friends and Seinfeld left our cultural zeitgeist.
2 Broke Girls shared commonalities with Girls of course — both are set in New York and both not only feature the word “girls” in their title, but also star women who seem to be trying to make it in the big city. However, all similarities basically end there, as Girls quickly separated itself and went on to be defined by its “fresh,” “new” and “edgy”  — to blanketly quote a legion of articles and thinkpieces written about the show shortly thereafter — take on the female world.
The show is revolutionary in terms of Dunham’s constant state of undress — she got naked on that show probably more than any lead actress on any television show to date, although don’t quote me on that one — and “real” depiction of life as a 20-something. The girls were young, naive and seemingly very incapable of leading any sort of responsible, adult life. Dunham’s character couldn’t hold a job, another couldn’t hold onto a boyfriend, another had never had sex and the last was stuck in a nice relationship she just couldn’t stand. Girls was frank, honest and funny — Dunham was an instant star.
Girls has been on a wild ride since then — it has battled ups- and-downs of both acclaim and criticism, equal parts awarded and snubbed. I started watching it my junior year of high school, and although I enjoyed the initial first season, I quickly lost faith in the series as season two premiered, as almost every episode left me in a constant state of anxiety or panic. I was on the brink of my 20s at the time, and if Dunham was the “voice of that generation” I certainly didn’t look forward to growing into whatever it was they were going through. I know I’m not the only one. The show’s emphasis on both comedy and drama -— often more drama than anything else — alienated viewers and steadily dropped viewership over the years.
However, the importance of the show is that it opened up an entire area of television that previously hadn’t been open to women. Comedy had previously been a man’s job, but with Girls, the comedy business revolutionized. It became OK for women to talk about personal issues — sex and love and drugs — and even more than OK, it became desirable; networks took notice. An entire legion of female-led shows popped up in its wake: Mindy Kaling’s The Mindy Project premiered on FOX, as did Broad City on Comedy Central. Female showrunners and creators became more commonplace as comedy became a woman’s world as much as a man’s. Dunham opened up a new avenue for women.
To be a woman in comedy is a powerful thing now. It’s an area of Hollywood that now welcomes the female voice with open arms. It’s proven not only to be interesting and new but also to draw in ratings like nobody’s business.
All this is great news if you’re a woman who wants to go into comedy. But for me — someone who’s primarily interested in science fiction and fantasy — there’s still quite a long road to be paved for women in those more male-dominated genres. My only worry with the success of Girls is that, while it has proven to be a very good arena for women to make their voices heard, it might be perceived as the only area. Women can talk about sex openly now. But multiple dimensions and time travel and black holes? Maybe not so much.
Only a handful of female directors are given opportunities that are similar to those of a man, and while directors like J.J. Abrams and George Lucas are great — we have yet to truly find,  or maybe accept — a woman in those positions of great power. What we need is the Dunham of science fiction in order to open up more genres of writing to women. Until then, it’s slow going.

Belgium drum and bass producer Boris Daenen, commonly known by his stage name, Netsky, hit the stage at Olympic gold medalist Shaun White’s Air+Style on Saturday. Air+Style is a two-day festival that occurred across the street from USC in Exposition Park. The festival featured two different stages with art, fashion and technology exhibits and most importantly, a signature 16-story high snowboard jump where the world’s top snowboarders went head-to-head with daring tricks and leaps all weekend.
Air + Style also showcased music for a weekend of fun and immersive experiences. Included in the festival lineup were many musical stars, including J. Cole, All Time Low, Haim, Incubus, A-Trak and Netsky.
Netsky was first introduced to the music industry as a teenager, booking shows in the EDM world.  He was heavily influenced by artists on Hospital Records, an independent record label from South London that specialized in drum and bass and liquid funk, which is a drum and bass style that has many instrumental layers and vocals. In 2009, Netsky was signed to Hospital Records and released a self-titled album in 2010, as well as a second album two years later called 2, which reached number one on the charts in Belgium. He’s released singles and remixes since then, with his newest single “Rio” taking off, especially after being featured in London’s 2016 New Year’s celebration. “Rio,” featuring artist Digital Farm Animals, is a feel-good funky track with an infectious bass and upbeat horns that does exactly what EDM is supposed to do: make you want to dance.
Netsky did just that when he took the stage at Air+Style as a part of his North American tour entitled Netsky and Chill. Netsky played an hour set on the City Stage of the festival, which featured LED video panels and was doused in lights, helping to create a stunning performance.
Although Air+Style featured many DJs Saturday, Netsky stood out from the rest because of his unique style and refreshing beats that got the crowd moving. While other DJs simply played back tracks and would sometimes grab the mic instead of focusing of their mix, it was easy to tell that Netsky was performing everything live, all thanks to the help of the master of ceremonies Script MC.
Script MC is one of the most well known EDM MCs today, and works to highlight the performance rather than himself. The music artist has worked with Netsky in the past on the Netsky Live project, where the DJ performs with a full live band and real instruments.
The Netsky Live show provided the high energy entertainment that many other EDM artists sometimes lose because it’s hard to capture the crowd’s energy on stage with just a DJ set. Highlights of Saturday’s performance included a stellar remix of Drake’s “Hotline Bling,” a mix featuring the catchy melody from Justin Bieber’s “Where Are Ü Now,” and of course, Netsky’s original track, “Rio,” which had the crowd, and even Netsky himself, grooving all night long.
There’s definitely a lot to look out for with Netsky, as he is an amazing up-and-coming artist in the EDM scene. Another album is definitely on the way, and Netsky will hit radio stations soon, especially at the rate he’s going now. Netsky has an interesting and unique sound and a captivating live show that draws his audience in, differentiating himself from many EDM artists out there. Time will only tell what great things this young artist will do, but in the meantime, be sure to check out his music.

Artist Eric Joyner’s collection “Sweet Dominion” is on display at the Corey Helford Gallery. Photo courtesy of Thomas Storesund.
There is something sublime, yet comforting, about eating fresh donuts at an art gallery opening. Sweet Dominion, Eric Joyner’s latest exhibition, premiered Saturday at the Corey Helford Gallery near Boyle Heights. A visit to the gallery makes a perfect treat for any art fan with a taste for ’50s nostalgia.
In an interview clip that greets visitors at the gallery door, the artist explains quite plainly what will become undeniable upon entering the showroom: “I paint robots and donuts, and I’ve been doing so for the past fifteen years.” This is Joyner’s fourth appearance at the Corey Helford Gallery, which seems to specialize in particular artists like Joyner.
This time, 20 of Joyner’s new paintings appear alongside a selection of the artist’s past works. Front and center is the piece “Melee,” a massive 81-inch work depicting robots battling in a packed coliseum — with obligatory donuts, of course. Visitors to the gallery’s opening were given the classic glazed treat and invited to eat while viewing the paintings — a lighthearted touch that further sweetened the whimsical, joyful tone of Joyner’s artwork.
The San Francisco-based artist became enamored with vintage robots after encountering tin Cold War-era Japanese robot toys. Though nearly every painting of his features both robots and donuts, how Joyner plays with their exact relationship is what gives the paintings in Sweet Dominion their liveliness. In some pieces, the desserts are objects of desire, whether affectionately, as in “North Beach,” or voyeuristically, as in “Cake in Lake,” in which a robot peers through bushes at a pink, supple cake that hovers above a lake’s surface. “Spiritual But Not Religious,” titled “Dark Energy” on the artist’s website, shows a robot worshipping an all-chocolate donut, bearing an expression of rapturous ecstasy. This painting is quintessential Joyner, disarmingly silly even while imbued with depth and some sarcasm.
Unrestrained, childlike joy informs everything Joyner does, right down to his signature, the “Joy” part of which is stretched out larger than the “ner,” as if in intemperate celebration of the painting’s completion. The artist’s paintings foreground motion and life in both their content and form. Joyner’s technical skill as a painter shines through in “Haste,” a profile of a robot riding a motorcycle whose wheels have been stretched into speedy comic ellipses. It stands among several paintings that recall cartoon mischief, like “The Unusual Suspects,” a classic roundup mugshot that doubles as a taxonomy of the artist’s robot species.
Joyner’s aesthetic is firmly in the line of ’50s retro futurism. The robots are tacky, square, and delightful; their affection for diners, donuts and domination is on full display in the current gallery. But Sweet Dominion showcases new themes in the author’s repertoire as well, including nature, the undersea and migration, as in “Movers and Shakers,” an almost heartbreaking robot pioneer scene. More than half of the new paintings have already been sold.
The collection is worth seeing in person, as the artist’s affection for these robots, as well as their ubiquitous donuts, is best conveyed when all the paintings are witnessed at once. The Corey Helford Gallery, across the river from the Arts District in a somewhat run-down industrial area, is a perfect site for Joyner’s paintings. A visit to the reclaimed warehouse cannot help but be bracketed between sightings of “real” robots, the construction equipment at rest around the Santa Monica Freeway bridge. The building is currently home to two other smaller galleries as well, a collection by Nathan James entitled Dark Matter and Below the Surface, a curated group show.
Joyner’s work will remain on display through March 19. The artist has also published a book of his work titled — appropriately — Robots and Donuts.

The No. 19 USC women’s lacrosse team defeated No. 5 Duke 11-5 Saturday night in the U.S. Lacrosse Orange County Winter Invitational in Costa Mesa.
The Women of Troy (2-0) claimed a spot in the Top 25 national rankings heading into the contest, but they were still underdogs against one of the ACC’s finest.
It is safe to say that this USC squad turned some heads with such a convincing win over a top-10 team.
Though the Trojans have only played two games, it is obvious that this defense is elite.
When they did not have the ball, USC’s defensive personnel made life difficult for the Blue Devils (2-2). Senior Courtney Tarleton scooped up three ground balls and caused a turnover, while Nina Kelty also came up with a strong performance at the back.
Head coach Lindsey Munday knew Duke would ask questions of this defense, so she ensured that the unit would be organized against the Blue Devils.
After the 21-2 win over Stetson in the season opener, Munday said, “Obviously momentum is great, but we know it’s really a new week. We have a lot to prepare for a great Duke team.”
She stressed the importance of defensive organization, particularly in transition. USC’s defense was clearly up to the challenge Saturday night at LeBard Stadium. USC forced 14 Duke turnovers and held the Blue Devils to a meager five goals — the fewest goals they had scored since April 2014.
With Duke predictably revolving much of the game plan around slowing down junior attacker Michaela Michael, fellow junior attacker Kylie Drexel exploded. Drexel logged four goals and an assist in the win, helping her side to a 6-3 halftime advantage. The Women of Troy extended the lead in the second half and started to run away with the game.
Prior to the game, junior attacker Michaela Michael said, “We’re going to have to work really, really hard off-ball to get opportunities.”
Michael’s work off the ball continues to be problematic for opposing defenses, as her intelligent movement demands attention and frees up space for teammates.
Duke will inevitably improve this season, but their lackluster offensive day was no fluke. This USC defense is looking like the real deal, particularly after dominating a team widely considered one of the best in the land.
USC fell to Duke 17-9 in the second round of the NCAA Tournament last season in the first ever meeting between these two schools on the women’s lacrosse field. This time around, the Women of Troy frustrated the Blue Devils with lockdown defense and offensive efficiency.
The team now prepares for its next fixture — a home game against Michigan on March 4.

Today is my birthday. It is a birthday I have been looking forward to for at least a decade because it is also my golden birthday. I turn 22 years old on this 22nd day of February.
I’ve been told that this birthday is an insignificant one. I celebrated the most monumental one last year when I turned 21 and legally became able to drink in every part of the world.
This is a conundrum that many millennials are facing. It feels like birthdays at this age are all downhill from here. It might seem like there aren’t extra rights or privileges that come post-21-years-old. Conventional wisdom tells us that the ensuing years will be filled with responsibilities, more serious relationships and other real-world situations.
Therefore birthdays begin to just feel like  — in DJ Khaled’s own words — “another one.”
But for all the young adults who are going through their 20s right now, settling down and locking down a full-time job becomes less and less plausible given the economy and changing American society.
Like I have written about many and many times before, what makes millennials special is how we adapt to a changing climate. Our generation has pushed back the marrying age to a median of 27 for women and 29 for men, according to a Pew Research Study. In the 1950s, the median age for women to get married was 20.
We’re also not finding full-time gigs as readily as our parents did when they were our age. You can blame this on changing industries, the economy and us being the most overeducated generation this nation has seen. Instead of a three-bedroom house, we might have to get used to living in shoebox-sized apartments or back in our parents’ house for a while.
These societal shifts are pushing back the traditional life milestones we should be expecting in our 20s. This period in our lives have been coined as “emerging adulthood” first by psychologist Jeffrey Arnett.
So we can look forward to blowing out more candles on our 2-fill-in-the-digit cake. We don’t have to dread the years ahead of us. We can use these years to travel, hop around cities and try out different jobs to know what we really want to do before fully settling down. It’s a gift not given to 20-somethings before us.
America, some scholars have written, is backing us millennials up on our plan to redefine our 20s. Arnett, a professor at Clark University, explained in his 2014 report that as our generation eases into adulthood, we help shift the mindset of the whole country.
“American society has become more tolerant of young people using most of their twenties to make their way to adulthood at a gradual pace, and to enjoy a period of fun and freedom before taking on the enduring responsibilities of adult life,” Arnett wrote.
Without the milestones of marriage or having kids or buying a house, we can start determining our own milestones. This year, after graduating college, I have plans to see Beyoncé live in concert, I want to drive to a country I’ve never been before — that means you, Canada — and I want to remember to pay my rent on time every month — we can all dream, right? And by the time my 23rd birthday rolls around I want to have another list of milestones that I will spend the year checking off.
Those goals don’t have to be inconsequential just because they are not the traditional ones attained during this decade of our lives. Now is the time to get as personal as we want. This sets ourselves up for the future, living the lives we imagine adults having.
It’s true that nothing might ever top the promise that comes with your 21st birthday. That taste of legality mixed with the comfort of college is priceless. Yet these next birthdays to come don’t have to be without meaning.
But we can remold our 20s into what we want them to be. Become the person you want to be using each year of this decade. Remember to have fun with the process, and live your 20s out like they’re golden.

Hannah Luk | Daily Trojan
The Metropolitan Water District, the primary water supplier for nearly 19 million people in Southern California, announced this month that its popular turf replacement rebate program may not be continued next year, even though the program provides visibility for non-traditional water conservation and improves drought awareness. When asked about why the program might be canceled, MWD Water Resource Management manager Deven Upadhyay said, “It was a one-time thing to try to ramp up attention on having more drought-tolerant landscapes while we’re in the drought.”
The rebate program certainly did just that. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the MWD teamed up to offer a budget of more than half a billion dollars for conservation to span two years. Many of these programs, like the turf removal rebate, were effective. The funding for the MWD turf removal rebate itself was exhausted in late 2015 due to overwhelming demand. However, the MWD should continue offering rebates for water-wise landscaping in Southern California.
Despite the popularity of the turf removal rebate, the MWD has determined that it wants to focus on other rebate programs. Los Angeles City Controller Ron Galperin further claimed in late 2015 that the turf rebates “had value as a gimmick,” but that real water savings would have to be evaluated before the MWD rebate was continued or expanded. While the turf rebate was active, the LADWP offered a $1.75 per square foot rebate and the MWD offered a $2 per square foot rebate. LADWP continues to offer its share of the rebate, but MWD has decided that it may no longer contribute to this particular water conservation method.
What the officials and administrators of the MWD seem to overlook is that the turf rebate program did not operate in a vacuum. The program and its associated ad campaigns spurred public awareness of the drought and water conservation methods. Gov. Jerry Brown also issued an executive order almost two years ago that demanded a 25 percent reduction in water usage. Considering that the residents of California have almost — but not quite — reached this goal, every method of water conservation should be considered for continuation, especially the most popular programs like the turf removal rebate.
The largest concern that city and MWD officials cite is that though turf removal is estimated to save 350 gallons of water per dollar spent on rebates over the product’s lifetime, water-efficient appliances are believed to save nearly five times as much. While this may be true, these officials do not consider the social impact that a prevalence of drought-resistant landscapes would have on those who have not converted their lawns and lifestyles. Washing machines are not usually visible from the street — lawns are.
The turf rebate project, while not the most cost-effective water-saving measure, played a substantial part in reducing California’s residential water use. For this reason, and because the water-wise changes that it facilitates are so visible to passersby, the MWD should continue to offer turf removal rebates to the 19 million Californians that it serves. Doing so will assist in reducing water usage, and any unspent rebate funds can be funneled into other programs at the fiscal year’s conclusion. Continuing the turf rebate program isn’t a matter of pure financial efficiency. There are conservation goals that have to be met, and it is worth investing in every source of contribution.

Editor’s Note: Due to an online publishing error, a previous version of this post contained text from a different article, “Girl talk: Lena Dunham’s influence on female comedy.” The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
From the Duplass brothers, the HBO dramedy Togetherness returns this Sunday with a brand new season that only builds upon the raw relationships and drama from season one. The show premiered to critical acclaim back in January 2015.
While Togetherness is just another show in a wide array of dramedies that have been flooding network, premium and streaming channels over the past few years, Togetherness takes the cringing, realistic awkwardness of everyday life to the extreme. Comedic at some points, Togetherness often strays too far from comedy to be considered as such.
Season two continues the painful story of Brett (Mark Duplass) and Michelle (Melanie Lynskey), who struggle to maintain their relationship as they deal with a world that rarely goes their way. The series also follows Brett’s best friend Alex (Steve Zissis), who is an aspiring actor, and Michelle’s sister Tina (Amanda Peet), who is trying to figure out what she desires in life. Unlike most HBO shows that are often driven on plot, Togetherness is a welcomed change that focuses primarily on the characters, and the problems they encounter in their lives.
Episode one of the second season picks up just barely beyond where season one left. To recap: season one depicted the straining relationship between Brett and Michelle as they both seeked something beyond the normalcy of their marriage in an effort to explore their other dreams. The season culminated with Michelle debating whether or not to partake in an affair with another man.  Season two reveals Michelle’s decision to us almost instantly within episode 1 and the her storyline for the rest of the season ultimately builds off of that.  
Throughout the season, there are plenty of moments that put the amazing writing and directing of the Duplass brothers on display. For example, in the episode “The Sand Situation,” the creators decided to strategically avoid a major confrontation between the four main characters and instead focus on the impact on those closest to them following the incident.  Another excellent display of storytelling is in episode 5, “Just The Range,” which uses montage to illustrate the various crises each of the four leads are facing and how even in these moments of chaos they are able to find something small to be content with.
Throughout the season, there are certainly moments of storytelling genius, but they are often overpowered by the lack of comedy, realistic character and story arc development, as well as overall tone. Toward the back half of the season, the writers take a more positive perspective on the show, which since its inception has been the epitome of dark and realistic. In season one viewers could feel the cohesiveness and build of the season’s final few episodes, season two lacks that power and boldness. Although this could be another ploy by the Duplass brothers as they consistently try and avoid what people expect, but forces the viewer to wonder what they ultimately have in store for potential future seasons and the storylines that accompany them.
While every show is not without its faults, Togetherness can rest easy, knowing that the power of the actors portraying these very dark and complex characters is palpable.  A highlight of this season, as in the first, is Lynskey, who takes on a majority of the emotional storylines and moments throughout the season with beauty and ease. Another highlight this season is the work of Peet who, as her character develops more deeply, grows as she really begins to understand the true desires of her character.
Togetherness is not a show by any means for the majority of the populous; in fact, if one is not a fan of the Duplass brothers and their work, viewing Togetherness should not be a priority.

The Emmy award-winning television series Girls, created by and starring Lena Dunham, returns to HBO for its fifth and penultimate season premiering on Feb. 21.. Dunham’s character, Hannah, rejoins her group of millennial friends from Brooklyn at Marnie’s (Allison Williams) wedding. The show continued its general format with humor that is hidden under multiple layers of irony and symbolism. It is no easy watch and can even be maddening at some points. Dunham and her team’s sharp writing  points fingers at current fads in society like the Bohemian-chic fashion trend and young adults’ obsessions with flower crowns. Most of the humor in Girls is relayed through inventive dialogue satirizing modern culture with general themes of relationships, friendships and what it means to be a woman of the 21st century.
These themes are explored through the impossibly charming, and at the same time, somehow terribly awful lives of Hannah and her friends Marnie, Jessa (Jemima Kirke), Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet) and Elijah (Andrew Rannells). Episode one of this season made fun of modern wedding themes. Marnie and her make-up artist decided on a theme that was “Selena Gomez meets Jesus” for her big day. Returning guest star Rita Wilson, who plays Marnie’s mother, is the voice of reason in this episode as she mocks the absurdity of the current trends in weddings. The satire continues throughout conversations of drug abuse and even controlling relationships. Dunham’s dark humor perfectly conveys society as the mess it truly is. These darker moments are met with touching dialogue between Hannah’s new boyfriend Fran and her lifelong friend Ray (Alex Karpovsky) that touches on modern relationships and narcissism of the 21st century. The first episode has a beautiful message of support and friendship and reminds the viewers why they continue coming back to watch this sometimes infuriating show. The characters are so relatable, yet continue to make painfully poor decisions every episode. The fact that viewers are able to sympathize with these characters proves just how brilliant the writing and perfectly subtle humor is.
Set primarily at the wedding, the season five opener contains many well-scripted discussions regarding true love and the hesitation present before commitment. The rare message that everything works out in the end is conveyed and begins the season on a hopeful note. Amongst all of this seemingly lighthearted conversation, however, lies the wedding drama that was bound to ensue. From weather problems to cold feet, Marnie’s big day is far from perfect. Furthermore, it wouldn’t be a Girls episode if Lena Dunham’s character didn’t bare it all for an awkward sex scene cramped in a small vehicle. Though critics may not still use “bravery” to describe this full-frontal nudity after five seasons, the general principle remains true. Dunham is truly heroic in showing that self-love is finally acceptable on screen, regardless of what body type is being featured. Her shameless writing and acting is an inspiration to all. She may just be the bravest feminist in the industry. Her playfully inappropriate humor is met with beautiful asides about individualism, love and trust.
The whimsical and slightly dark world that Dunham has created is adored by the young millennials who seem to relate to the problems conveyed in the series, however grotesque they may be. These problems are brought to life by the most frustrating group of characters on television today. Their ignorance provides some maddening confrontations, sex scenes and outright awkward drama. This season, Lena Dunham seems to be poking fun at her quirks, and the script even contains some meta jabs at herself through the characters in the show.
The expectations of the second-to-last season of Girls have so far been met by the sharp writing, beautiful cinematography and unique direction. Though the opener is ever-so-predictable, wedding episodes of any television series usually are. The most intriguing moments in this episode seem to be the more intimate moments, rather than the usual dark comedy. Ray shares one of the best moments of the show by saying that “love is about sacrifice and destiny and making a sacrifice for the one you love that allows them to find their destiny.” There are very few shows that can balance humor and heart-wrenching asides so well, thus proving yet again that Dunham is truly a genius. She has captured the staunch realism and painfully awkward nature of living as a young adult in today’s world, and this season is no exception.

A group of students and faculty members joined Dr. Maura Cullen, the author of 35 Dumb Things Well-Intended People Say: Surprising Things We Say that Widen the Diversity Gap and a veteran social justice educator, for a social justice leadership conference Friday. A joint effort between the Office for Residential Education and the Office of Religious Life, the USC Social Justice Summit consisted of a six-hour interactive conversation about how to lead effective discussions about diversity in today’s social climate.
With complex terms like passing, microaggressions and intersectionality intermingled with fun magic tricks and videos, Cullen pulled from more than 30 years of experience in social justice training to lead a safe discussion about issues ranging from eating disorders to transgender rights.
Junior economics major Pastor Villagomez said he came to the event specifically for that experience.
“The big reason [I came] was to hear the side of a professional who has been studying and advocating for social justice for 30 years, and take their opinion into consideration when forming my own opinions of how society should act on social justice issues,” Villagomez said. “I’m interested in seeing how she balances the importance of having individuals with self-esteem and mental toughness with navigating a world where we’re going to have friction.”
Cullen highlighted this friction with her own anecdotes, but she also allowed students an environment to share their experiences with diversity. Focusing on differences in appearance, gender, class, race, religion, physical capabilities, sexual orientation and more, students spoke in small groups about how issues of social justice impacted their lives.
To freshman philosophy and policy, planning and development major Rebecca Hu, this close-knit format was essential.
“I think something that is little but also very important is how we’re all in small groups learning everyone’s stories,” Hu said. “It goes back to her idea of multidimensionality that we need to see people as more than one thing, as more than just black and white.”
Stories were, in fact, a common theme throughout the summit. As she talked about issues, Cullen pushed the importance of noticing those stories and differences that make people who they are, but she also urged students to notice wisely.
“We are curious creatures. It’s how our brains are wired,” Cullen said. “Noticing things is not the problem. It’s what we do with that information.”
Cullen shared her personal story of self-preservation as a lesbian woman and social justice educator. She emphasized the importance of love and inclusion in her own life, as well as in the lives of those she encounters.
“My wish for all is that everyone have the chance to be loved unconditionally, but the deal is this: once you get it, you must give it,” Cullen said. “Not only can it change people’s lives, it literally can save people’s lives.”
