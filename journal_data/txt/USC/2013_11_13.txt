Entrepreneur Johnny Earle, better known as Johnny Cupcakes, spoke to students about his business Monday in Taper Hall of the Humanities at an event hosted by the USC Speaking Committee.
Earle started selling T-shirts out of the trunk of his ’89 Toyota Camry. Now, he has a multimillion dollar business with locations in the United States and England. He was named America’s No. 1 young entrepreneur by Bloomberg BusinessWeek in 2008, as well as one of the 30 most innovative businessmen in Massachusetts by the Boston Globe in 2011.
As a kid, Earle set up lemonade stands and yard sales, selling his father’s old tools and his sister’s toys while his parents weren’t home. He bought a shovel for $9 and shoveled snow so that he could buy better winter garments for himself. Later, he performed magic tricks and was paid $20 for every 30 minutes he performed at birthday parties.
Though Earle has a borderline learning disability, he saw the quality as beneficial rather than disadvantageous.
“I didn’t believe it was a disability,” he said. “I thought it was a superpower.”
When Earle grasped what he wanted to do with his life, he said he poured passion toward it and used his disability to his advantage.
“When I found out what I wanted to do, I would put 110 percent into it,” he said
Earle also gave several pieces of advice to USC students who were interested in becoming entrepreneurs. He described the time when he made a yearbook out of a scrapbook when his school did not have one. Because he did not have enough money to buy supplies to make the yearbooks, he took pre-orders before making them.
“I sold a product that didn’t even exist yet,” he said.
In advertising, Earle said, students can offer an incentive, provide a sample of the product and approach people they know as well as talk to new people. When talking to new people, there are three essential components, Earle said. The entrepreneur should have a good handshake, good eye contact and not have bad breath — qualities necessary in a marriage as well, he joked.
“You could have a million dollar idea, but if you have horrible breath, they’re not gonna listen to your idea,” he said.
In deciding which items to sell, Earle said he had to become creative.
“Since my friends were already selling drugs, I had to sell something else,” he joked.
Earle instead chose to sell candy. Earle sold 100 packs of candy for a dollar each two times a day, making $200 a day. In a week, he made $1,000.
“I would come back everyday with a backpack full of cash,” Earle said.
Earle had another creative breakthrough when he came up with the idea for Johnny Cupcakes T-shirts while ordering T-shirts for his hardcore metal band. He said was intrigued by the machines that made T-shirts.
“[I thought,] I can’t afford T-shirts, but I’m gonna learn how to make them,” Earle said.
Though Earle started businesses when he was young, he instead advised students to get hands-on experience through internships. By getting hands-on experience, Earle said students can learn what they want to do for the rest of their lives and what they don’t.
To follow his passion and pour in all his energy into it, Earle said he had to cut down on distractions such as video games, social media, television, partying and relationships.
“Time is the most valuable thing you have,” he said.
When he printed out his own designs and started wearing his T-shirts to his work at a record shop, people who usually didn’t even make eye contact with Earle started laughing. Earle said his experience shows that a company does not need big investors to become successful. Alex Zhang, a freshman majoring in business administration, agreed.
“It’s a common misconception that you need [venture capitalists] to back you up when you can just do it yourself and work slowly,” he said.
The reason Earle’s brand has stayed in business for 13 years and is a multimillion dollar business is that all of the products it releases are based on experience, Earle said.
For example, the company had a breakfast shirt that they only sold during breakfast hours. Though some customers were angry at the sale cutoff time, the strategy worked: people talked about the brand.
The company also gave out free breakfast with the purchase of the shirt as a form of brand advertising.
“It might cost a little bit more money and time, but I feel that we get that back with brand longevity,” Earle said.
Earle said the most important aspect in creating a new business is originality. To determine this, Earle said entrepreneurs should ask themselves one question.
“What are the 10 plus things that make your [business] unique?” Earle said.
Gurleen Chadha, a junior majoring in neuroscience, was intrigued by the brand’s name and logo.
“The brand image, because it’s called Johnny Cupcakes and it has nothing to do with cupcakes, I think that’s really funny because it’s a good way of capturing people’s attention, and packaging and marketing the brand as it is,” Chadha said.
Many students were eager to learn how Earle developed his business concept and how he marketed his products. Tiffany Tse, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences, said she was curious to know how he was able to build a successful business from such humble beginnings.
“If you’re not from a big brand already, it’s hard to get established and if you’re just starting off from nothing, it’s hard to make so much money off a simple T-shirt,” she said.
A unique feature to Earle’s business strategies is to remain an independent business. He turned down offers from companies such as Macy’s, Nordstrom, Urban Outfitters and Hot Topic to carry his products in their stores in order to continue curating a memorable experience for the customers.
“If you do sell to stores, make sure you sell to the right stores,” he said.
Students were able to connect with Earle’s strategy of remaining independent to maintain its values.
“When you want to have that much control over a product and you sacrifice things like that, it’s taking a huge risk, but it ends up paying off,” said Brian Shaw, a junior majoring in human biology.
In terms of personal success, Earl also had a piece of advice for students.
“Real success is being happy doing what you love,” he said.

Despite the common perception of college food consisting of ramen noodles, soda and junk food, USC students actually have the option of eating farm fresh produce delivered directly to campus.
Boxed goods · The South Central Farmers organization currently offers boxes of organic food for students to pick up at the JEP House. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
In addition to the grocery stores that surround the university, USC students can participate in the South Central Farmers produce delivery program.
“It is very hard to get fresh produce in Los Angeles, and I have found that these fruits and vegetables are incredibly fresh,” said Joshua Bernstein, a graduate student studying philosophy, who ordered a box this week.
“This is a really unique program, and I hope that USC continues to have it,” he said.
USC is one of the locations the South Central Farmers Coop, a community-supported agriculture group, drops off boxes of organic produce at on a weekly basis. Susan Harris, the program director for South Central Farmers at USC, estimates the program has had a pickup location at USC for around five years. USC students can order either a full box or a mini box of organic, seasonal fruits and vegetables and pick them up at the Joint Educational Project House on Wednesdays between 2 and 6 p.m. The boxes cost between $15 and $25 a week, and all the produce is farm-fresh and locally produced.
Though many students are not aware of it, the program has gotten some attention recently. Earlier this month, the delivery program  was featured in Undergraduate Student Government’s weekly newsletter.
Community supported agriculture, better known as CSA, is a relatively new concept  in farming that has been gaining momentum since its introduction to the United States in the mid-1980s. The South Central Farmers CSA is a nonprofit organization that is “committed to engaging and empowering community members around attaining food sovereignty and access to high quality organic produce,” according to the group’s website.
USC is not the only university South Central Farmers delivers to — the group also has three pickup centers at UCLA. Other locations the group delivers to range across Los Angeles, from the Beverly Hills Farmers Market to the Watts Farmers Market.
Since Harris took over coordination for the USC campus in 2010, she estimates students have ordered between three and 12 individual boxes each week.
“We have several students who regularly buy boxes every week and are very happy to have this service provided conveniently on campus,” Harris said. “I believe it could be a much bigger program.”
Advertising could be part of the reason the program has remained relatively small. Many students said they were not aware of it.
“I hadn’t heard of it before,” said Jade Rechler, a freshman majoring in broadcast and digital journalism. “But it sounds like a really great program that I would love to learn more about.”
Others agreed that the CSA is something they might be interested in subscribing to.
“This seems like an awesome program for students at USC, so hopefully it will gain more traction and recognition on campus,” said Rachel Ben-Menachem, a freshman majoring in theatre.

On Wednesday, Mark Humayun, who has served as the interim chair of the USC Department of Opthamology in the Keck School of Medicine since Sept. 16, was named the inaugural director of the USC Eye Institute.
Humayun is currently a professor of ophthalmology, biomedical engineering and cell and neurobiology at the Keck School of Medicine and the Viterbi School of Engineering. He also holds the inaugural Cornelius J. Pings Chair in Biomedical Sciences.
Humayun is known for his research and development of the Argus II artificial retina implant, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February 2013 as a way of restoring sight in people blinded as a result of retinal degeneration. As director, Humayun said he plans to make continued and innovative research a priority as he oversees the 36 faculty members in the department.
“The groundbreaking work at the USC Eye Institute will lead to transformative new solutions for preserving and restoring sight and the USC Department of Ophthalmology will be the conduit that provides these treatments safely and effectively to patients with vision problems,” Humayun said in a press release.
USC’s ophthalmology program was ranked No. 9 in the country in this year’s U.S. News & World Report “Best Hospitals” rankings.
Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett, Carmen Puliafito, dean of the Keck School of Medicine of USC and Tom Jackiewicz, senior vice president and CEO for USC Health, issued a statement about their excitement about Humayun’s ascension to the position.
“We look forward to his continued commitment to the highest levels of basic and translational research through his leadership of the USC Eye Institute,” the statement read, adding that the three “are confident that USC’s tradition of strong leadership will be maintained.”
Humayun emphasized the prioritization to improve all practices of medical research.
“We plan to achieve our new goals through continued emphasis on clinical, research and educational missions,” Humayan said.

On Wednesday, the USC Center on Public Diplomacy at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism hosted Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico’s former ambassador to the United States and current fellow at USC’s Center on Public Diplomacy, in a panel on United States-Mexico relations.
Foreign ties· Ambassador Arturo Sarukhan speaks about the relationship between Mexico and the United States on Wednesday. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
Pamela Starr, associate professor of international relations and director of U.S.-Mexico Network at USC, and Jay Wang, director of the USC Center on Public Diplomacy, joined Sarukhan on the panel.
“No bilateral relation has as many implications for domestic politics as the relation between the U.S. and Mexico,” Wang said. “It is, in fact, an illuminating case of how intertwined and how interdependent foreign policy and domestic policy have become.”
Sarukhan, who served as an ambassador from 2007 until January of 2013, compared multiple perspectives on the Mexican-American relationship. He also brought  humor into the discussion.
“Whenever one speaks, especially in this type of setting, I am reminded especially of what a friend in Texas told me. ‘Public speaking is like a Texas longhorn: there’s a point here, a point here and a lot of bull in the middle,’” Sarukhan said.
Jokes aside, Sarukhan also spoke seriously on the bilateral relationship between the two countries.
“As I thought of the conversation today, I thought it would make sense to do a sort of comparative approach, and use Charles Dickens as a template for the talks,” Sarukhan said. “And just as his template in the Tale of Two Cities the relationship between Mexico and the U.S. … is the best of times and the worst of times.”
Sarukhan said the “best of times” began with the North American Free Trade Agreement, which linked Canada, America and Mexico economically. This agreement revitalized Mexico and ended its jingoism while promoting increased codependence, he said.
“I think that NAFTA really changed how both governments interacted with one another,” Sarukhan said. “I know a lot of people who still believe that NAFTA is not a success, or a disaster, but we must agree that NAFTA is one thing and one thing only, a free trade agreement … and that it has done admirably well.”
Sarukhan gave examples of NAFTA’s effects, citing the fact that $1.4 billion worth of trade happens daily on the U.S.-Mexico border and that Mexico remains the second largest importer of American goods. He also argued that the recent reverse in immigration trends comes from NAFTA’s revitalization of Mexico. Sarukhan said that the hardest part in the relationship between the two countries comes in swaying the public’s opinions.
“Why is this the worst of times?” Sarukhan asked. “Because public opinions and public perceptions differ wildly from this diagnostic I have given you. And it’s basically been driven by … two drivers. The first one is obviously immigration … The second issue, obviously, has been the violence that has occurred through the shift in the paradigm of transnational crime.”
Sarukhan told an anecdote from when he became the first Mexican ambassador with an official Twitter account. Though he started tweeting in English, within three weeks, there was uproar in Mexico.
“‘Why are you tweeting in English? You have to tweet in Spanish,’” Sarukhan said people told him. “Then suddenly I realized that if I was to make headway convincing both sides of the border, I would have to tweet bilingually.”
Students who attended the event were impressed by Sarukhan’s speaking ability.
“[Sarukhan is] an amazing guy,” said Syuzanna Petrosyan, a second-year graduate student studying public diplomacy. “I’ve heard and read a lot about him. He’s a great speaker with a lot of experience. He’s very innovative in his approaches when it comes to diplomacy and foreign policy.”
Sarukhan, who will now serve as a distinguished scholar at the CPD, said his main difficulty as ambassador was catering to citizens of both Mexico and the United States.
“At the end of the day, and I’ll finish with this, if you were to ask me what was your most relevant challenge as a Mexican ambassador, I’d probably say winning both the hearts of Mexicans and Americans,” he said. “The largest challenge was to convince Mexicans and Americans that there are no two societies more relevant to each other’s well-being than Mexico and America.”

USC Hospitality announced that The Habit will replace Carl’s Jr., located in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, in January. A smaller fast food chain, The Habit is known for its “charburgers.”
“We’re always looking for healthier alternatives,” Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality, said. “It’s a balancing act. In the dining halls, we took away chicken nugget Tuesdays and students had a revolt. We want to offer students healthy alternatives but also make sure we give them choices and selections.”
The Habit won’t be the only new option on campus next year. Nekter Juice Bar is also expected to come to USC at the Shop Café located in the School of Architecture. Nekter serves all-natural, raw, vegan juices and smoothies.
“I’ve never heard of [Nekter] but I’m excited to try it out,” said Ani Misirian, a junior majoring in neuroscience. “It definitely sounds healthier than some of the options we have including sugar-laden Starbucks and Coffee Beans that I rely on too much during finals. I’d definitely be willing to check it out as long as the juice is within my price range.”
Klinger said part of the reasoning behind bringing in two lesser-known chains was to give students not only healthier options, but also less common ones.
“Our goal is to offer students what they want and to stay ahead or at least with the trend,” Klinger said. “We believe that USC is a great place and want to enhance the student experience by offering unique dining options.”
Many students were enthusiastic about the upcoming changes.
“I’m really excited because The Habit is a healthier, more appealing option,” said Amanda Ciozda, a senior majoring in biological sciences and neuroscience. “The taste is much better than Carl’s Jr.”
Unlike Carl’s Jr., a chain with locations around the world, The Habit is exclusive to the western United States. The current owners bought the first one in Goleta, Calif. Currently there are 90 locations, 81 of which are in California. The other nine are in Utah and Arizona.
“I’m excited about the change because I think it’ll give students a refreshing change in selection when it comes to dining at the Campus Center,” Misirian said. “I personally really enjoy going to The Habit back home [in Glendale, Calif.] so it’d be nice to go at school. I don’t think it’s necessarily healthier because they’re both fast food options but personally, I prefer the taste of Habit more, especially their onion rings.”
Not all students, however, agreed on the health benefits of the new burger joint.
“Personally I don’t think this change will affect me much because it’s still fast food,” said Harmony Huynh, a senior majoring in biological sciences and neuroscience. “The only places I go at the Campus Center are Lemonade and Seeds because they have salads and other healthier alternatives. It’d be nice if they brought something like Lemonade.”
Others believed that The Habit, whose slogan is “There’s No Substitute For Quality,” will prove to be healthier than Carl’s Jr.
“I don’t eat fast food too much and I’ve never been to The Habit but I’m willing to try it because it sounds healthier,” said Elaine Ying, a senior majoring in linguistics and psychology.

Students were encouraged to stand up for their legal rights at a workshop led by the Los Angeles Community Action Network at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Wednesday night.

The Know Your Rights event, sponsored by the #USChangeMovement, Alpha Phi Alpha and the Political Student Assembly in partnership with the Black Student Assembly and Undergraduate Student Government, was organized to teach students and community members how to respond to interactions with police, as well as create more transparency in law enforcement.
“Students should have the knowledge and responsibility to know the law, and bridge the gap between the public and law enforcement,” said Tandia Elijo, assistant director of the #USChangeMovement and outreach director of PSA.
Issues of racial profiling and excessive police force have been a common topic of discussion at USC in light of last year’s Halloween shooting and the May 4 incident. Speakers at the Know Your Rights event included LA CAN members, lawyers and a Los Angeles Police Department officer who gave students tips on how to respond to officers and ensure their rights are not violated.
“It’s important to know what your rights are and assert them in a nonthreatening way,” attorney John Raphling said.
Despite the focus on racial profiling, Katie Gavin, a junior majoring in music and a #USChangeMovement board member, stressed the importance of the topic for students of all backgrounds.
“White students may think this issue is not important to them but if you are a member of the community and sharing this space, it’s your responsibly to not be a passive part of the system,” she said.
Many students in attendance reported having negative experiences with law enforcement officials, and were interested in learning what they could do to prevent similar situations in the future.
“I was at the infamous party on May 4 last year and saw the whole thing happen, so I think this workshop is a good idea if a situation like that were to happen again, but it can be avoided if we educate ourselves,” said Tomi Akingbola, a sophomore majoring in human biology and biological sciences.
In order to contend with instances of abusive police force, LA CAN civil rights organizer and community watchman General Dogan spoke about the power of documentation. He said that documentation is one of the key factors when trying to prove a case of police brutality or racial profiling.
“Students have to document what is going on. They have  together and say this isn’t what we came to school for,” Dogan said. “You need to be armed with the right equipment: a video camera and clipboard.”
Jeremy Gross, a senior majoring in political science and business administration, said he felt he had been a victim of abusive power in a recent altercation with a DPS officer, and felt that it was important to learn how to prevent his rights from being violated.
“Since it’s almost inevitable that you will end up in a situation with the police at some point in your life, knowing your rights makes it more likely that the situation will work out in your favor,” Gross said.
LAPD Officer Anthony Pack spoke to students about his own experiences being profiled by officers and tried to send the message that he and other officers are working to change the situation.
“Where I grew up, I never trusted police either,” Pack said. “But I wanted to be the person to change that as an African-American officer.”
Throughout the conversation, Pack and Dogan both stressed that knowing one’s legal rights is crucial in order to stand up to law enforcement as well as to adequately report police misconduct.
“We want to bring awareness to police brutality and racial profiling,” Dogan said. “It a bigger issue than one school, one incident and it needs to be stopped.”

The USC women’s soccer team entered the 2013 season with hopes of building off the momentum from the previous season, which they ended by upsetting archrival UCLA at home. After earning a No. 25 preseason ranking this year, the Women of Troy hoped to improve on a 6-10-3 (3-6-2 Pac-12) record and make an appearance in the NCAA Tournament.

But even though the team occasionally showed a lot of promise, missed opportunities caused the Women of Troy to fall to an 8-10-2 (3-7-1 Pac-12) finish, and head coach Ali Khosroshahin was fired after the Women of Troy lost 4-1 to No. 2 UCLA to end the season.
“We wish Ali well and thank him for his dedicated service in bringing the first NCAA women’s soccer title to USC and to the Pac-12 in 2007,” USC Athletic Director Pat Haden said in a press release announcing Khosroshahin’s termination.  “But based on the past few years, we felt it was time to go in a new direction.  We need to reinvigorate our program and get back to contending for NCAA and conference championships.”
USC hasn’t had a winning season, made the NCAA Tournament or finished higher than sixth in the Pac-12 since 2010.
“I think that in terms of effort and how well we worked together, we worked really well and came close in every game,” junior forward Jessica Musmanno said. “We just got unlucky most of the time, which obviously stinks but there’s nothing we can really do about it now. So taking that frustration, I think we’re just trying to build on next season.”
USC started off the season strong, scoring four goals in each of their first three games while only allowing four goals total. The 12 goals were a program record for USC in its first three games, while the 3-0 start matched the Women of Troy’s best since 2007, the year they won the NCAA Tournament.
USC stumbled a bit through the rest of its nonconference schedule, finishing 2-3-1 to head into Pac-12 play with a 5-3-1 record. The sequence still had its highlights, including a 5-1 victory over Loyola Marymount, the most goals the team had scored in a single match since 2010. Sophomore forward Katie Johnson earned a hat trick in the win, marking the first USC hat trick since senior forward Elizabeth Eddy pulled it off in that same 2010 match.
The Women of Troy had a rough start to conference play, losing their first three contests and failing to score a goal in any of them. The team bounced back up in Northern California, earning a 1-1 tie against California and upsetting then-No. 5 Stanford 1-0. The Women of Troy hoped to carry that momentum into their game against Arizona in the Coliseum, but the Wildcats pulled out a 3-2 victory in overtime.
USC would go 2-2 in its final games leading up to its match against the Bruins in Westwood, including a 2-1 win over Oregon State in the last minute of overtime on Senior Day. Sophomore midfielder Jamie Fink scored the first goal the Bruins had allowed at home all year, and the Women of Troy went into halftime with a 1-1 tie. But UCLA took over in the second half, scoring three goals en route to a 4-1 win to remain undefeated in the conference.
And with that, Haden decided he had seen enough — Khosroshahin was let go the following day, marking the end of an era in USC soccer.
“I would like to thank USC for the privilege and opportunity to lead the women’s soccer program, and I wish them all the best in the future,” Khosroshahin said in a USC press release announcing his termination. “It was tremendous to be part of the Trojan Family.”
Khosroshahin, who led the Women of Troy to their first national title in 2007, leaves USC with a record of 82-53-15 (30-31-8 Pac-12) in seven seasons, but just a 21-33-5 (10-20-3) mark in his last three years in Los Angeles.
Eddy led the team with six goals on the season, while Johnson and Fink finished with five each. Freshmen played a big role for the Women of Troy, as defender Mandy Freeman earned All-Pac-12 First Team Honors, while midfielder Kayla Mills led the team in assists (8) and points (16). Both Freeman and Mills made the Pac-12 All-Freshman Team, while Freeman became the first USC player to be named a conference first-teamer since 2009 and the first freshman since Amy Rodriguez in 2005. Fink also earned a spot on the All-Pac-12 Honorable Mention.
“They’re definitely gonna help us out and be as strong, if not stronger, next year,” Musmanno said about the impressive crop of freshmen.
Despite creating plentiful scoring opportunities, USC often failed to convert on its chances. The Women of Troy dominated their opponents in shots (350-199) and corner kicks (129-64) on the year, but were only able to outscore them 31-27.
The USC defense and goalkeeping from junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley helped keep the Women of Troy in their matches, as eight of their ten losses were by only a goal.
But ultimately, the squad couldn’t pull out enough wins to earn an NCAA berth, and Khosroshahin paid the price.
“We all are obviously very thankful of Ali because he recruited us all here to be able to play at USC and it’s sad to see anyone go,” Musmanno said. “We’re all excited for a new opportunity and a fresh start with a new coach. We’re anxious to see what’s going to happen.”

Since Ed Orgeron took over as interim head coach more than six weeks ago, “fun” has been his preferred buzzword for USC football. This week, however, a different term has come en vogue: “physical.”
That’s exactly the sort of game expected on Saturday against No. 5 Stanford. In their upset over then-No. 3 Oregon last week, the Cardinal ran the ball an incredible 66 times, including 45 by running back Tyler Gaffney alone. They held possession of the ball for 42:34 of the game’s 60 minutes, and went 15-for-22 on 3rd and 4th down, often on simple handoffs right up the middle.
“It’s a challenge to go in there and have then execute their blocking schemes as well as they do,” said Ed Orgeron. “It’s nothing real fancy, it’s just a matter of them doing it with real good players and doing it really well.”
Orgeron has deemed Saturday’s matchup a “line of scrimmage” game, and he smiled when asked about it at practice Wednesday evening.
“I love it,” Orgeron said. “It presents a challenge. It’s what football’s about.”
Stanford does not pose the same type of schematic challenges as the Trojans have faced in weeks past against some of the Pac-12’s more pass-happy attacks. But that doesn’t make them any easier to prepare for.
“You gotta be assignment perfect [against Stanford],” senior defensive lineman Devon Kennard said. “Because they’re good at what they do. And they trust what they can do is better than what you can do.”
Stanford often lines up with not a single wide receiver on the field. The defense knows it will be a run play. Stanford knows that the defense knows. And they run it anyways, with great success.
“They line up and they tell you what they’re gonna run and they run it still, fourth-and-one or first-and-20” junior linebacker Hayes Pullard said. “You just know they’re gonna run that play. You gotta get your cleats in the ground.”
As dominant as their rushing attack is, the Cardinal are not a one-sided team. Quarterback Kevin Hogan is among the steadiest performers in the conference, and while many feel he’s not in the Pac-12’s elite echelon of quarterbacks, Orgeron says they are not taking Hogan lightly.
“He is a darn good quarterback,” Orgeron said of Hogan. “The plays he makes, he’s one of the better quarterbacks we’ve seen all year. He’s big, he’s strong, can thrown the deep ball, and can run.”
Stanford is one of the most disciplined teams in the country, committing just two penalties against Oregon. And coach Orgeron knows USC will have to be nearly perfect to knock off the Cardinal.
“We have to stop the run. But we also have to stop the deep ball,” Orgeron said. “We have to tackle well and play well on the line of scrimmage. They’re gonna make plays, we can’t get discouraged. This is a good football team. It’s gonna be a battle until the very end.”
Williams’ Status
Sophomore defensive lineman Leonard Williams remained probable for Saturday, as Orgeron did not have any updates on injuries. Williams said he received a PRP (platelet-rich plasma) shot on Tuesday.
“Overall I feel like I’m getting a lot of my strength back,” Williams said. “I should be ready to go Saturday.”
Williams said the injury — his right shoulder blade — occurred during fall camp, and has been nagging him all season. However, he aggravated it more severely against Oregon State and had to sit out last Saturday’s contest against Cal.
“It was a smart decision to just rest it,” Williams said.
Coach Orgeron said he expects Williams to play Saturday, calling him “very important” to the Trojans chances against Stanford.
“We’ve been working on as many things with him as we possibly can,” Orgeron said. “But he’s gonna have to play and play well for us.”
The pressure is on for Williams to play, especially given the opponent and their style.
“Guys in the locker room are telling me to make sure I’m ready to go, so it’s adding pressure.” Williams said. “But not too much. I love physical games, so I’m pressuring myself to be ready to play.”
Williams said he believes he might need surgery when the season is over.
Not Created Equal
“Treat every game the same” is a common mantra among all athletic teams, and a fair one too. But the reality is, no two opponents are the same. And while this game counts just as much as the last one in the standings, the team knows it many other ways, it counts a little more.
“We all know the importance of this game,” Orgeron said. “What it means to the Trojan fans, the type of team we have coming in. Everything surrounding the game.”
USC has lost four straight games to Stanford, the Trojans’ longest losing streak in the history of the rivalry.
“There’s just a whole different level to this type of game,” Williams said. “We haven’t beaten them in a few years. It’s a home game. They just beat Oregon. It’s a lot bigger game.”

I’ve been consumed.
For exactly seven days now, ever since the clock hit triple-zeros in Palo Alto last Thursday to solidify Stanford’s “upset” win over Oregon, I have obsessed over one single thought. I’ve been so gripped by it that I can’t concentrate in class. I watch TV, but my mind drifts back to it. No matter how hard I try to distract myself, it’s always there.
Stanfurd …
I don’t even know where to begin. I have so many terrible things to say and they all want to come out at the same time. How can I possibly pick just one? I mean, look at how I spelled Stanfurd. Yes, that’s a “u.” That’s how Cal fans commonly refer to their bitter rival.
Say it with me now, and grit your teeth: “Sstahnfurddd.” Let the “d” linger. It makes your blood pressure rise, doesn’t it? I’ve been at USC for almost four full football seasons. In that time, the Trojans have beaten every single team in the Pac-12, save for one.
Stanfurd …
More than a year ago, I wrote a column that must be among the most unprofessional pieces of writing ever published in the Daily Trojan. It was more or less about my unbridled hatred for the Stanford Cardinal, and it wasn’t even remotely close to resembling a piece of objective journalism.
This won’t be either. Why?
Stanfurd …
For four straight years, the Cardinal have beaten the Trojans in increasingly maddening fashion. The “What’s your deal?” blowout at the Coliseum in 2009, the oh-so-close loss in Palo Alto in 2010, the heartbreaking triple-overtime instant-classic in 2011 and the upset that wasn’t really an upset a year ago.
Watching Oregon vs. Stanford a week ago was brutal. Being able to count on the Ducks losing a big game is one of my favorite parts of college football. But my dislike for them is nothing compared to my hatred — yes, hatred — for the Cardinal.
Stanfurd …
When their fans stormed the field after beating a team ranked a mere two spots ahead of them in the BCS, my first reaction was disgust. As the saying goes, “Act like you’ve been there before.” And as much as it pains me to say, Stanford certainly has. But then I just smiled.
Smile probably isn’t the right word. It was more of a smirk. I thought about this Saturday: primetime, under the lights at the Coliseum, College GameDay in the house. I cannot even describe my level of anticipation. It’s the game of the season for me. As a fan, if I had to choose to beat either Stanford or UCLA, it wouldn’t be a question.
Stanfurd …
One win. That’s all I ask. One win in my time here over the team I grew up despising as a Cal fan — and Stanford wasn’t even good back then. That stupid train horn they play after every score. Storming the field after practically every win. I mean, some of their students bring laptops to games and study! What? That should be an automatic zero in whatever class they’re studying for. Or a 15-yard penalty, I don’t care.
This is not just another game on the schedule. To call this a grudge match would be selling it short. I don’t actually know what comes after a grudge match, but whatever it is, it still wouldn’t describe this. I don’t think I can recall a week in my time on this campus in which a game was so anticipated.
Stanfurd …
Everyone knows what this game means. The notes distributed to the media this week describe Stanford as USC’s “longtime foe and recent nemesis.” That could not be a more apt description. All four California schools in the Pac-12 have always had rivalries, beyond the obvious regional ones in USC-UCLA and Cal-Stanford. But to some USC fans, especially younger ones, Stanford has risen its way to almost the same rung as UCLA or Notre Dame. For others like me, they’re well past.
It’s time to restore order. Stanford is a fine school, with a fine athletic tradition across a variety of sports. But this isn’t tennis or swimming or golf. This is football. For Stanford to be better than USC — and they have been, for half a decade now — is unacceptable. It is a disturbance in the force of college football. They shouldn’t matter. They should be an insignificant blip in the path of not just USC, but every college football team.
They’re not Alabama. They’re not Ohio State. They’re not Notre Dame or UCLA. They’re not even Colorado (look it up, seriously). They’re just …
Stanfurd.

My first recollection of the rivalry is 1969, USC at Stanford and the defensive penalty that allowed SC to win a no-time on the clock game.   In 1971, Stanford visited the Coliseum needing a win to repeat as Pac-8 champions. Memories; Stanford utilizing the USC playbook running the infamous Power-I, student body right, student body left,  a 33-18 victory.  Lightning flashing and thunder sounding in the coliseum, the Thunder Chickens.  The 1972 game; John McKay after the victory “I’d like to beat them by 2,000 points”.  The 1976 24-0 Stanford lead at half, Ricky Bell’s sprained ankle in the middle of the third and a freshman Charles White scoring 48 unanswered points.  I remember the 49-0 shellacking administered in 1977 in the rain.   USC ‘s 11 game winning streak between 1980 and 1990 and prior to that we both have alums that recall USC 12 win streak from 1958 to 1969.  All before your time.  The 2009 “what’s your deal”, the “ills of hubris” (i.e. Utah 2013, Washington 2012).  The recent Oregon game was a great thrill, then the  gut punch, allowing 20 in the fourth quarter; old Stanford finding a way to give the game away.  Your memories of the 3 past years are never to be forgotten. To be talked about with your fellow classmates, family and friends who support you and agonized the losses with you during your years at school. They will be the unbreakable ties that bind and give you strength.  One last comment,  all you did was admittedly reveal yourself as a true Cal Weenie, in USC sheepskin.  The rejection letters from Cal, Stanford, UCLA and possibly Notre Dame probably sting as much as the losses.
“The strength of the tribe is measured by the strength of its enemy” Stanford is a reflection of that.
Knowing the author, I can say he did not apply to Cal, Notre Dame, UCLA and especially (and obviously) not Stanford. You had the best comment yet until that pot-shot
It’s GREAT being a Stanford Cardinal. I’m sure many students at USC wished they could have been a part of that 5% of applicants to the Class of 2017 that received a thumbs up from Stanford Admissions.  Stanford is simply the best example of combined academic and athletic success.  We are what USC craves to become.
Carolina, In the real world, nobody cares where you graduated…unless it’s law or MBA. Nobody cares if your school yields a single-digit admission rate…because it’s known that high school level academics can be gamed to get into places like Stanford. Stanford is an elite school indeed, but I hope the vast majority of people there aren’t like you. 
LOL, there is an acquaintance of mine who graduated from Cornell, who occasionally brags about how prestigious and selective his school is, and loves wearing his “Cornell” sweatshirt everywhere he goes. But this same dimwit smokes weed all day, is unemployed, has no g/f, plays video games all day, etc. LOL!!!
The maturity and social intelligence of the USC student’s response to Caroline of Stanford is of note. This may be one reason why employers voice a desire to hire USC students over Stanford students whenever possible.
If it’s so GREAT being a Stanford Cardinal why are you spending your time posting on the Daily Trojan website?  Seems kind of strange thing to do for someone that got that big thumbs up from Stanford Admissions and is the epitome of all that combined academic and athletic success.
One difference between USC and Stanford: Stanford students know that studying is the process to doing well on tests and subsequently in class. Apparently USC hasn’t come to that realization yet if they say that studying, regardless of whether it’s at a football game or not, should lead to a flat zero. Still a hilarious article though
U$C $ucks
Be jealou$
Lol, good luck with that.
So funny.  So very, very right on.  A death in the family would not keep me from watching this game.  I mean, death is gone and done with.  But USC-Stanford….

On Wednesday, senior outside linebacker Devon Kennard was named as one of the nine semifinalists for the Lott IMPACT Trophy award sponsored by The Pacific Club IMPACT Foundation. The award honors a defensive player for his athletic performance as well as his character.
Comeback · Redshirt senior linebacker Devon Kennard has led USC’s strong defense this year after missing last season with a pectoral injury. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
As one of the Trojans’ team captains this season, Kennard has enjoyed a remarkable rebound campaign after missing the 2012 season with a torn pectoral muscle. He ranks 20th nationally in sacks (8) in addition to his 47 tackles, 10 tackles for losses, four pass deflections and a fumble recovery.
Kennard also takes care of business in the classroom. He’s maintained a 3.23 GPA while receiving 2010 and 2011 Pac-12 All-Academic second-team honors and is currently studying for a master’s degree in communication management. Last year while rehabbing his injury, Kennard received his bachelor’s degree in communication from USC’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
Though Kennard is an impressive candidate, he has stiff competition. The other semifinalists include Anthony Barr (linebacker, UCLA), Chris Borland (linebacker, Wisconsin), Aaron Donald (defensive tackle, Pitt), James Morris (linebacker, Iowa), C.J. Mosley (linebacker, Alabama), Ed Reynolds (safety, Stanford), Ryan Shazier (linebacker, Ohio State) and Kyle Van Noy (linebacker, BYU).
The Lott IMPACT Trophy award is named after former USC All-American and NFL All-Pro safety Ronnie Lott. IMPACT is an acronym that stands for Integrity, Maturity, Performance, Academics, Community and Tenacity.
To date, the foundation has donated more than $1 million to charities across the nation. The winner will receive $25,000 and the runner-ups will receive $5,000 for their respective universities’ general scholarship funds. Last year’s recipient was former Notre Dame and current San Diego Chargers linebacker Manti Te’o.
The list of semifinalists will be narrowed down to four finalists on Nov. 27 and the winner will be announced at the 10th annual Lott IMPACT Trophy Banquet on Dec. 8 in Newport Beach, Calif. Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott is scheduled as the keynote speaker at the banquet, which will be televised live by Fox Sports at 7 p.m.

USC won its first home game under new coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke on Wednesday night, staking out a big lead against San Diego State before withstanding a late rally to win 65-61.
Step up · Junior guard Ariya Crook assumed control of USC’s offense after senior forward Cassie Harberts got into foul trouble in the first half. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The game came down to the final seconds after the Women of Troy (3-0) were up by as much as 19 points in the first half. Junior guard Ariya Crook scored a team-high 18 points while senior forward Cassie Harberts contributed 17 points for the Women of Troy. The victory avenged last season’s devastating 34-point loss to the Aztecs (0-2).
The Women of Troy came out of the gates with a vengeance, attacking the Aztecs on both ends of the floor en route to a 24-5 lead. At one point, USC’s defense held the Aztecs scoreless from the floor for more than 10 minutes.
“We jumped on them early,” Cooper-Dyke said.
But turnovers and fouls allowed the Aztecs to gain some momentum as the final minutes of the first half wound down, and managed to cut USC’s lead to 32-19 heading into the locker room.
“We never quite regained that initial intensity back in the latter part of the first half,” Cooper-Dyke said.
Though the early foul trouble caused the Women of Troy to back off defensively, they showed the makings of an elite defensive team.
The Aztecs made just three of 19 attempts from the floor in the opening half for a dismal field goal percentage of 15.8. San Diego State scored just six of their 19 points in the first half from the field, tallying their other points at the free-throw line. The Women of Troy forced 15 turnovers in the first half and Aztec center Cierra Warren, a Louisville transfer, was held scoreless in the first half.
Once the second half was underway, the Women of Troy could not seem to find the perfect combination of players on the floor, causing their 13-point halftime lead to quickly wither away.
As the Women of Troy struggled to regain control of the game, Warren was able to get into a rhythm, making her virtually unstoppable. Warren ended up with a game-high 21 points, all of which came in the second half. She scored 12 of the 13 points during a late run for the Aztecs to cut the Women of Troy lead down to just three late in the second half.
Crook was fouled and sent to the line with 2.6 seconds left on the clock, and knocked down one of her free throws to extend USC’s lead to 65-61 and halt the Aztecs’ last-gasp comeback attempt.
It was fitting that Crook would take the final free throws for USC — the junior guard took the offensive reins for the team while Harberts was sidelined for most of the first half due to foul trouble. Cooper-Dyke spoke highly of the budding leader.
“She can score and she’s a great passer,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We expect her to perform well offensively.”
But after missing an easy layup in the second half, Cooper-Dyke says Crook still needs some polishing.
“She can either get too high or too low in temperature, so my coaching staff is working with her to find a happy medium,” Cooper-Dyke said.
Crook says her coach’s upbeat demeanor has helped spark her play.
“She really motivates me,” Crook said. “She gave us confidence and has been shifting our mentality from street ball to team ball.”
Crook is not the only one who has bought into the Cooper-Dyke system.
“It’s a different mentality,” said Harberts. “She preaches score, score, score but does not let us forget about defense.”
The offense-first system seems to be working so far — the Women of Troy are 3-0 for the first time since the 1998-99 season, and have defeated three opponents — the Aztecs, Fresno State and UC Davis — who beat them last season.
“It’s important for me to stress that USC women’s basketball is not about the [Cheryl] Miller, [Sheryl] Swoopes and [Paula] McGee era,” Cooper-Dyke said, referring to the trio of USC hoops legends who increased the relevance of the program alongside herself. “It is these players’ time to leave their footprint and create their own legacy at this school.”
If the Women of Troy continue to play at this level, they will be well on their way to doing just that.
Harberts says her teammates are working on translating the great off-the-court chemistry they have developed over the past couple years to the court. As the season progresses, the Trojan faithful will see if they are able to successfully do so.
The Women of Troy’s get a nine-day break before their next game on Nov. 22, when they’ll take on Oklahoma State in Stillwater, Okla.

My name is Daniel, and I’m a Spotify addict. I actually have been for quite some time, so perhaps it would be more accurate at this point to call me a Spotify abuser.
I love Spotify. Typically, a session starts with an artist I know, say The Tallest Man on Earth. When I’m ready to move on, I usually click on the related artists tab and select a new artist, perhaps someone I haven’t heard of before. And when I’m tired of my new selection, I move on again.
Before I know it, hours have passed and what began as a session of gentle folk has become Top 40-pop or country twang. That’s also the point at which I can recite all of the ads, many of which are disruptive and out of line with the genre I’ve been listening to (cough: Yeezus Tour ad).
My addiction to unfettered music listening didn’t begin with Spotify. There was Grooveshark before, which perhaps is where I first learned to break the chains of having to own music in order to listen to it. I began to explore and, as with Spotify, listen to different genres of music, which came with sampling a wider variety of songs than I would were I simply digging through my own music library.
But Spotify changed things. It happened first on Facebook. With the click of the Spotify play button, suddenly my “friends” could see what exactly I was listening to. More importantly, they could see everything I listened to from the Sweeney Todd soundtrack to Animal Collective’s Strawberry Jam.
I never turned on the Spotify setting to share on Facebook, or perhaps I did and didn’t mean to. In any case, after a few thoroughly uncomfortable incidents when some of my more embarrassing listening was chronicled on my Facebook wall, I promptly shut off this feature.
Unfortunately, this did very little to correct the issue of my “friends” snooping on my listening history. It turns out that Spotify had its own ticker that showed exactly what I was listening to and when. This was eventually turned off and only my friends who “follow” me can see what I listen to.
But the fact that even some people can see what I’m listening to at any given moment, including my most embarrassing moments (cue that Backstreet Boys throwback), often makes me self-conscious about my Spotify activity. It’s for this reason that I’m pretty fast to turn on private browsing to hide the fact that I’m listening to an embarrassing artist or song.
And I’m not the only one. A friend uses the incognito mode when she feels like listening to the Les Miserables soundtrack (not that there actually is anything embarrassing about that, but it’s her call).
“I should really do that because I listen to a lot of embarrassing things on Spotify,” another friend told me while I was talking about writing this column.
Better late than never, I suppose. I’ll stop there for a moment.
I’m made slightly uncomfortable with the ease at which I wrote that last statement, “better late than never,” because of the ease at which I seem to be endorsing the use of Spotify’s private browsing.
At the end of the day, the question might be asked: Should turning on private browsing even be necessary? I’m thinking you can guess what my answer would be but, in case you’re missing it, my response would be a resounding no.
The fact that I’m uncomfortable — as are my friends — with other people seeing what I’m listening to for fear of embarrassment is indicative of a larger online fear. For many, there has emerged an added external pressure that comes with Internet activity: what people will think of you.
Many might claim to be immune to this, but it’s something that I think most of us think about when posting. I certainly do. It causes me to hold back and think twice about posting something that might be unpopular, esoteric or only applicable to a few of my friends. In many cases, a check such as this is a good thing. It’s prevented me, more often than not, from posting something that I could potentially regret down the line.
Still, it also prevents me from displaying my true personality online. Instead, all that comes through is a filtered projection of it. Of course, in the everyday, what comes through of our personality can vary vastly depending on time, setting and company. Yet, this is worsened online.
By displaying only filtered projections online, it’s easy to lose our personalities on the Internet, or worse, create different, false personalities online. There’s no easy fix to this and, as I mentioned before, self-censorship is not a wholly bad thing. I just might take an extra second to reconsider selecting private browsing on Spotify next time.

TBS’ new workplace sitcom Ground Floor premieres Thursday. The show — created by Bill Lawrence (Cougar Town, Scrubs) and Greg Malins (2 Broke Girls, How I Met Your Mother) — centers on Brody (Pitch Perfect’s Skylar Astin), a 20-something San Francisco banker at Remington Trust who aspires to master the corporate world like his boss, Mr. Mansfield, played by John C. McGinley. Brody’s plans for world domination are thrown for a loop after a one-night stand with “ground floor chick” Jenny (Cougar Town’s Briga Heelan), a building maintenance worker who — like many of her ground floor co-workers — received only a modest education and pay.

So what’s not to love? The premise is promising but it remains to be seen whether the show can really capitalize on its young talent and whether the two central characters can go for more than just the easy laughs. Unfortunately, Astin doesn’t embody the effortless charm that his character so desperately needs.
The show does manage to steer away from the typical rom-com mold with beta male humor that is somewhat reminiscent of Ted Mosby from How I Met Your Mother and J.D. from Scrubs. Jenny is all for the casual sex while Brody has to trick her into going on a real date, and Brody shows his sensitive side before his serious one. Thankfully Ground Floor stays away from the hackneyed raunchy jokes that have become a staple of modern comedy, but the show’s attempt at subtle humor doesn’t always hit its mark.
Viewers learn how unfulfilling corporate life can be when Brody walks in late to his own birthday dinner — because he was at work, of course — to find his colleagues celebrating, taking little notice of the fact that he’s not even there. On the upside, Astin does break out his singing voice toward the end of the pilot with some quality Elton John. And even though Jenny seems content with her life, the show suggests both she and Brody could learn from one another. Office dance parties are fun, but what happens when the music gets turned off?
The supporting cast members, namely Jenny’s quirky ground floor co-workers, provide some interesting workplace comic relief. They call the tech guy — who himself has a creepy obsession with Jenny — “Harvard” because he went to a very prestigious community college. The show does a decent job portraying the ground floor workers in a way that makes them comparable in intelligence to the suit-wearing and grossly overworked bankers. The jokes grow funnier as the show goes on and we learn Brody wakes up at 4:30 a.m. to start “jugging” his hair. The show provides decent character development for Brody but he seems to waver between wanting a personal life and a professional life and his indecision makes him difficult to relate to.
The real comedic potential, though, seems to be the relationship between Brody and Mansfield. McGinley’s character contains pieces of his Scrubs character, everyone’s favorite mean man, Dr. Cox. Mansfield, however, is much quicker to show his sentimental side.
Though Astin is a decent lead and Heelan holds up her end of the bargain, McGinley is the real scene-stealer. He’s tough but honest and just a little overly involved in his employees’ personal lives. A touching moment occurs when he points out that he worked his butt off when he was younger and since then, never missed his daughter’s volleyball game. Sure, Mansfield has his flaws — but he’s the most fun to watch.
The show has potential. Some of the jokes — particularly those of a sexual nature — are a little overdone, such as when Brody shouts “Yahtzee!” when he’s sexually aroused.
On a network like TBS, Ground Floor isn’t likely to be a mainstream hit or grow a huge fan base like Scrubs, but it’s still worth tuning into and packs enough of a punch to survive for a few seasons at least. It’s modest but well-written, and though it’s not an all-star cast, there is some obvious talent in Astin, Heelan and McGinley.
The show will air two back-to-back episodes tonight. TBS has scheduled a 10-episode run with the season finale slated for Jan. 16.

When the curtain came up at the Fonda Theatre in Hollywood, Conway stood at center stage with a strange and confident presence that made everyone look up from their pre-show drinks. Dressed in a shiny gold full-body spandex suit and sporting a dishevelled short blond head of hair, she appeared to be more of a futuristic superhero than a rock band frontwoman. From the outset, Conway commanded the stage with her bold personality, obscure costume choices and, above all, unfiltered energy and enthusiasm.
Headline “Killer” · Los Angeles singer Conway opened for The Fratellis, but the blonde songstress stole the show at the Henry Fonda Theater in Hollywood with her unique dance moves and catchy pop songs. – Photo courtesy of Sony Music
The L.A.-based artist returned to her hometown on the West Coast leg of The Fratellis’ tour, after opening for the Scottish rock group in Seattle, San Francisco, and Portland, Ore. The tour is in conjunction with the release of her new EP, Big Talk. Conway played all four of the songs from the recent release in the high-energy show.
Conway is as unique in her musical style as she is with her wardrobe. Her music meets somewhere in the middle of pop and rock, with her punkish vibe coming through regardless of how slow or fast the song is.
Rolling Stone recently named Conway one of the the top 10 discoveries at New York City’s CMJ festival. The magazine described her performance as “enthralling” and her style as a mix between Karen O and Ke$ha.
To better understand her style, it might be useful to throw in a bit of Pink with a dash of Lady Gaga. In short, she’s punky, talented and just the right amount of weird.
Her opening track, “Killer,” kicked off the affair with a driving bass and rhythmic guitar in the light, poppy track. Conway herself jumped right into it with an impressive display of obscure, almost interpretive dance moves. She commanded attention from the crowd as the first of three acts, and transitions from a nameless opening act to the life of the party.
It would be easy to dismiss her as a freak with her ridiculous costume and dancing — that is, until she opened her mouth. Her vocal range was impressive, demonstrating the power needed to front a rock group, with the soft tenderness of any leading female vocalist.
The headline track, “Big Talk” was the show’s highlight and the artist’s most popular. The song was lead by a funky, bouncing bass and a catchy chorus that is just asking for radio plays.
The single sports its very own music video that has a currently racked up nearly 400,000 views on the artist’s VEVO account. Conway shot the video entirely herself on her MacBook, filming at various locations in Downtown Los Angeles. If Conway is to break out from the underground and make it into the mainstream, it will surely be on the heels of tracks such as “Big Talk.”
“Hustler” marched along with a driving drum line and booming vocals. Conway really dove into her performance of the song, bouncing around the stage with her version of the robot and pelvic thrusts. The band continued to play as if it’s completely normal. The backing group is talented, but this show is about only one person.
In the singer’s final song, “Take Me Back,” Conway showed off her skills further on the pop end of the spectrum. The slower song has less punky bass and more tender vocals, showing that she can own the stage with her voice, as well as her dancing and funky costumes.
Conway concluded her set with an overwhelmingly positive response from the audience. Even though the evening was not about her, she surely won over the audience, evidenced by the massive line at her merchandise table throughout the rest of the evening.
Following Conway’s performance, fellow Angelenos The Ceremonies played an impressive 45-minute set. The folk-rock group consists of three brothers: Matthew, Michael and Mark Cook. All under the age of 21, the trio sports a Jonas Brothers-type of appeal. The three stand in their respective thirds of the stage, each sporting a different hairstyle. Fratellis frontman Jon Fratelli described The Ceremonies as “talented, but too f-cking handsome.”
Their music is equally as appealing as their style. The three brothers bounced off each other in harmonies like those of the Beach Boys, as the array of guitars, saxophones and harmonicas built a multilayered, but never messy, rock sound.
The Fratellis, playing as the main event of the evening’s program, did not disappoint. The Glasgow-based indie group filled a two-hour set with a mix of old hits and songs from their newest record, We Need Medicine, to culminate in a fabulous show.

When news broke that Ronan Farrow, the 25-year-old son of actors Mia Farrow and Woody Allen, might actually be the child of Mia Farrow’s ex-husband Frank Sinatra, the media pounced. The news didn’t seem to be all that shocking to Ronan Farrow himself, who playfully tweeted, “Listen, we’re all *possibly* Frank Sinatra’s son.” And Ronan Farrow isn’t a stranger to spitting jokes on Twitter. On Father’s Day, he tweeted “Happy father’s day — or as they call it in my family, happy brother-in-law’s day.”
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
It is apparent there are no family secrets — well, at least on this subject — in the Farrow household, and Ronan Farrow handled the situation with aplomb. After all, nearly anyone could “possibly” be the son of anyone else. And by all appearances, Ronan Farrow is a successful, well-adjusted young man with an upcoming news hosting gig on MSNBC.
Ronan Farrow seems to be handling the flurry of media attention well. But the topic of parentage is not always such a laughing matter. It also raises an inquisitive problem: There must be thousands — perhaps even millions — of other young people out there who aren’t aware of their true parentage and have grown up believing that their father is, indeed, their father (or, conversely, that their mother is, indeed, their mother). These people essentially go through life believing a lie.
Nowadays, it is commonplace for adoptive parents to make sure their kids are aware of their true parentage, and in many cases, encourage them to reach out to their birth parents and establish relationships with them. Should it be any different for kids growing up with one biological parent and one who isn’t? It depends on the circumstances.
For Brian Hansen, a 32-year-old actor and blogger from New Jersey, finding out that his father wasn’t his father was the best news he could have ever received. Hansen’s father was extremely hard-hearted and disagreeable. According to CNN, when his cousin casually broke the news to Hansen over coffee that his biological father was, in fact, a sperm donor, and not the same man Hansen grew up with, Hansen was overjoyed.
This is not a very common reaction. According to CNN, “the news can rock a family whether the parent-child relationship is good, bad or downright ugly. This type of news will raise issues of identity and trust, especially if other family members were in on the secret.”
Hansen, however, didn’t seem to have any of these problems, and continues to live his happy life blogging.
At what point in an individual’s life is it okay to tell him or her about who his or her true parent is? What good or harm could it do to learn the truth? Is there ever an instance when it’s just better not to know?
Unfortunately, it is difficult to tell and every situation is different. But this much is true: Openness and honesty is key between a parent and child, no matter the nature of the relationship. This kind of availability allows the child space and closure to take time to come to terms with the news.
“She thought she was doing the right thing by not telling us, and in her view, he loved us, she loved us, they were our parents — and none of the other stuff mattered,” Hansen said in an interview with CNN.
But in the end, instead of thinking about protecting the child, the parent should develop an open and honest relationship in order to truly protect the parent-child relationship.
Every family has its issues, but one thing should be permanent: honesty.

Last month, USC welcomed liberal atheist Bill Maher, who delivered a stand-up show that featured jokes about a 10-year-old Donald Trump and Jerry Sandusky and phrases such as “blacktracking.” On Sunday, religious conservative Ann Coulter spoke about her latest book, and during the talk, interspersed serious criticism of the Republican Party with creative descriptions of how she envisioned the hosts of MSNBC committing suicide.
Most liberals hate Coulter. Most conservatives hate Maher. Apparently, each side has discovered that it can use Google to instantly compile a host of reprehensible things that the other side had said. To be sure, Maher and Coulter occasionally cross the line, but the reactions of even their supporters usually keep them in check. For every crack at immigrants or minorities that Coulter makes, Maher is there to match her with a mockery of the religious or far right republicans.
In the context of the majority of the material that Maher covers on his show or that Coulter writes about in her columns, the quotes for which they are most notorious make up shockingly little of what they actually say. Oddly enough, most folks’ opposition to the pair begins with the misconception that they are, on some level, serious about these most flagrant of assertions. This assumption should be challenged.
I overheard a woman sitting at the Ann Coulter event say that she was such a fan of Coulter, not because she agreed with what Coulter said, but because she thought Ann Coulter was the most masterful “troll” of the decade. By troll, she borrowed a term from the Internet generation to mean that Coulter is really just messing with everyone when she suggest things such as, “My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times building.”
Given this, we can separate the goals of Coulter and Maher into two categories: to make money and to get people fired up. Though almost everyone in politics wants to make money — a glance at how many presidential candidates end up landing TV shows proves this point decisively —  it’s more interesting to examine the latter point.
In most cases, political hatred and partisan rhetoric has done the United States great harm, especially when that rhetoric comes from elected officials who are tasked with crafting and passing laws. In the case of Maher and Coulter, though their hate-speech is taken seriously by a solid portion of their followers, in most cases, it does more to get people involved in the serious issues of politics than it does to damage society.
But again, why do Maher and Coulter do what they do? The simple answer is they wouldn’t be nearly as successful if they had begun their careers writing for the Washington Post or the Wall Street Journal. Bill Maher rakes in millions from a weekly show on HBO and the occasional national comedy tour. Ann Coulter, who writes a syndicated column each week, appears frequently on national news programs. Oh, and that book she was promoting? It was her eighth New York Times best-seller.
Voters are busy. Too busy to listen to candidate debates, too busy to keep up with the news and oftentimes too busy to make an informed decision. One thing that Coulter and Maher bring to politics is that they make voters care. Simply put, Coulter and Maher give voters something to hate. Ironically, that might do more for productive politics than it does to hurt it.
This idea is made stronger by examining the ideas, again ironically, that Coulter and Maher agree on. In both of their talks, they discussed a hatred of the media. Each discussed politicians who disappoint voters by giving over to special interests and lobbyists when they get elected. Most telling of all is their response to people who suggest they run for office. Both are quick to emphasize that they would be the last people they would recommend run for office.
Why?
That’s not their job. Their job is not to represent voters, but rather to get voters to care. In a perfect world, Coulter and Maher wouldn’t do that by making the flagrant remarks that they do, but in a perfect world, everyone would also vote. In the spirit of not making the perfect the enemy of the good, Maher and Coulter might do more good for American politics than they do bad.

Smart assessment.
Astute observations Nathaniel. I’m on the Maher side, but agree that these two folks serve as excellent trouble makers … in a good way. I still like to listen to Ann when I see her somewhere, because both of them offer great food for thought.
Trouble is that too many people simply don’t seem to care one way or another.
I’m glad you do. we’re leaving the mess we old guys helped create to you and my USC freshman daughter. Some of the problems ain’t pretty either.
Keep up the good work.

November is Homelessness and Hunger Awareness month, and Graduate Student Government and other service organizations at USC have many events planned to give students opportunities to give back.
It is easy to remember the things to be thankful for, but this season, it will be just as easy to become aware of issues we are less familiar with and to serve those who are less fortunate.
The month of activities kicked off on November Nov. 4 with a screening of The Soloist, a movie starring Jaime Foxx and Robert Downey Jr., that addresses the issue of homelessness, particularly in the L.A. community.
“I think it went really well, we had a good number of students attend, and some brought donations for our food drive that we’re holding all month long,” said Emma Frances Bloomfield, director of Community Service for GSG.
Bloomfield cites the movie screening as a great way to raise awareness of homelessness and get students motivated to participate in the service projects throughout the month.
“If people missed the screening, we’re having a second showing of the movie on Nov. 13 at the Health Sciences Campus in the Hastings Auditorium, and we hope to see even more people at that one,” Bloomfield said.
More prominent this month will be the opportunities for community service, which GSG has organized along with the Caruso Catholic Center, the SC Homelessness Initiative and the United University Church.
“Every Tuesday this month we’re having sandwich and blanket making at the Caruso Catholic Center,” Bloomfield said. “Students can just show up at 6 p.m. We make the sandwiches with the help of a community organization of nearby women and children, and then we deliver the sandwiches to Skid Row.”
The sandwich delivery to Skid Row presents a unique experience for students to interact with the community surrounding USC and see their service having an actual impact.
“I can’t wait for the sandwich delivery. I just think it’s so important for students to see how the issue of homelessness is so central, not only to L.A. but in our own area — the Skid Row visits really shed light on the issue,” Bloomfield said.
Bloomfield also highly encourages students to participate in the food drive that will be happening this month, citing it as a simple yet impactful way to get involved.
“We’re accepting canned and packaged foods all month, which can be dropped off at the GSG office in TCC 224 or brought to any of the service projects, so that’s another easy way for people to help,” Bloomfield said.
Another way to directly provide essentials to those in need will be the winter aid kit assembly event at the United University Church Peace Center, and then the distribution on Skid Row, both of which will be held on Nov. 24.
“We ask that students donate supplies for the hygiene kits like toothbrushes and toothpaste, deodorant, shampoo, as well as winter clothes like hats and gloves,” said Vivian Yan, who works with the SC Homelessness Initiative and the United University Church.
Students can also participate in the HomeWalk 5K in Exposition Park on Nov. 23 if they are looking for a more active way to give back. The 5K will not only raise money to fight homelessness, but also give participants a first-hand look at the issue of homelessness in Los Angeles.
“After the walk, participants are invited to join LAPD officer Deon Joseph on a walking tour of Skid Row,” Yan said. “That’s going to be a really great opportunity to see the real issues in that area, he knows so much about it and he will be able to point out where the issues and causes lie.”
Joseph will also speak at the Responsible Volunteerism Workshop on Nov. 20, where he will give students an in-depth look at homelessness in Los Angeles to shed light on some causes of homelessness and the best ways to help.
“There are tons of students who want to help the homeless and hungry, and a lot of times they just resolve that by donating food or clothing, but a simple act like that could have repercussions, so we like to look further,” Yan said.
As a community in such close proximity to those in need, Yan said the university has a unique opportunity to develop a deeply impactful and conscientious method of resolving the issues of homelessness and hunger.
“Just feeding people can lead to trash on the street, leading to a more negative neighborhood atmosphere, so part of what we are trying to do is help people realize the best ways to sustainably help people, like giving them water bottles that they can drink and then recycle for money,” Yan said.
Both Yan and Bloomfield hope that the many events this month will encourage students to familiarize themselves with homelessness and become more regularly involved in serving the community surrounding USC.
“I think that when people come to our events, people will be excited to join in for additional service, it’s all about getting your foot in the door,” Yan said.
Participation in any one of this month’s events is a great way to start getting involved in charity work, and can open doors to more opportunities for service in the future.
“This is a month where we highlight homelessness and hunger, but obviously it’s something that occurs year-round, and a lot of these organizations hold activities year-round that I would really encourage people to get involved with,” Bloomfield said.
