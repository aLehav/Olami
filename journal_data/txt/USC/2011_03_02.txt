As USC continues its path toward becoming a more global university, the undergraduate admissions office has implemented new tactics to recruit students from Chinese public high schools.
Daily Trojan
Instead of solely visiting the international high schools that typically send their students abroad for college, USC is now focused on spending more time in mainland China visiting students in public high schools, according to Kirk Brennan, director of Undergraduate Admissions.
Brennan said the admissions office noticed an increase in applications from students in mainland Chinese public schools and decided it was important to continue to get the word out about USC.
“We go where the great students are,” Brennan said. 
Over the past five years, USC has experienced a 250 percent increase in enrolled freshmen from China from 2005 to 2010.
This increase in the Chinese student population not only reflects the new recruitment tactic but also mirrors the development of China as a growing global force, according to Clayton Dube, associate director of USC’s US-China Institute.
“China now needs to transition from being a country of cheap labor to being a country of innovators,” Dube said. “There’s an economic ability to send students abroad, and there’s an economic necessity to send students abroad.”
Although it’s not possible to predict whether this increase in the Chinese population at USC will continue in the coming years, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions does not have any plan to limit the number of applicants it admits from China.
“Capping isn’t really in our thinking in any kind of arrangement; it’s impossible to imagine how disproportionally the market would have to grow to even consider any governing measure to control the population,” Brennan said.
Brennan added that he thinks, the increased Chinese population is beneficial to both Chinese students and students of other cultures.
“Our students have a better experience, we feel, by hearing from students with different perspectives,” Brennan said. “The more diverse the perspective from the classroom, the better the education.”
Some international students say a larger Chinese population helps them ease into the new culture, as well as feel closer to home.
“If you have Chinese friends, it’s easier to get updated about what’s going on at home. You have someone you can talk to about things like Chinese New Year,” said Sherry Wang, a sophomore from Beijing majoring in business administration.
USC is continuing to work to unite the two cultures, according to Dominic Cheung, chair of the USC East Asian Studies Center.
“We have already established a lot of impact in China with the US-China Institute … We are doing a lot to promote the interest of Chinese studies, both in large general education courses and also in upper division and graduate seminars,” Cheung said.
A large international population is also beneficial to USC for dealing with international relations.
“On a global scale the U.S. government is interested in having international students because we can directly show the world what the American way of doing things is all about,” Brennan said. “It’s a great way to spread good will.”
The choices Chinese international students have been making upon graduating from USC have been changing over the past couple of years, according to Dube.
Until recently, Dube said, many students have stayed in the United States or gone to Singapore or Hong Kong, instead of returning China.
“The reason for this is mostly personal, they value economic opportunity and the choices they have in the U.S. and elsewhere,” Dube said.
But according to Dube, China has recently been offering more job opportunities for individuals.
Jing Pu, a first year masters student studying electrical engineering, plans to find a job in the United States after graduating from USC, but intends to go back to China after a couple of years because she still feels more acquainted with Chinese culture.
“Many more people today feel like their economic future will be in China, but they will feel like it’s necessary to get some work experience outside China first,” Dube said.

Ragazzi Room, located on 2316 Union Ave. just off Hoover Street, was once a popular hangout for USC students. With its proximity to campus and status as one of the few independent coffee shops in the area, it was often host to groups of students coming in to study, work or relax.
Cozy · Graduate students Kory DeClark and Monica Cure assembled a team of more than 30 volunteer workers to renovate Ragazzi Room. - Cory Sanford | Daily Trojan 
Two and a half years ago, ownership of the space transferred to Jay Jung, and since then the Ragazzi Room went through a period of gradual decline in the eyes of its customers.
Then, a team of volunteers stepped in.
Kory DeClark, a graduate student studying in philosophy and one of the students who helped with the shop’s renovation, said Jung was struggling to make the Ragazzi Room a viable dining option for USC students and others. DeClark lived in the area throughout his time at USC and developed a relationship with Jung almost as soon as he took ownership of the Ragazzi Room.
“I knew just from having conversations with him every time I went in there that he was slowly doing worse and worse,” DeClark said. “He was making less money so he cut corners to stay open, but by cutting corners he got less customers, which gave him less money, He was the first one to say he didn’t have a business background.”
Jung, who had previously worked in both the aerospace industry as well as accounting, was retired when he took control of Ragazzi Room and wanted to make it a friendly, common gathering spot for students.
“Jay really just wanted to open a little coffee shop where he could help people with their taxes, which just struck me as such a wonderful thing to do,” said Monica Cure, a graduate student studying comparative literature. “When Kory started talking about the fact that he got to know Jay a little bit, I put two and two together and it was just a no-brainer that this was someone who deserved help.”
In the beginning of January, DeClark and Cure decided to assemble a team of volunteer workers to assist with the project. They were able to put together a full team of architects, marketing specialists, chefs and more.
“Monica sent out the e-mail and within two days we had about 30 people banging on our doors wanting to help,” DeClark said. “At that point there was really no stopping the ship so we just got on.”
After assembling the volunteer team, DeClark and Cure made the plans and set the work period for the last weekend in January.
In one weekend, the team completely renovated the interior of Ragazzi Room. They replaced the furniture, repainted everything, removed clutter and built new benches and countertops.
In addition to the work on the interior, DeClark and Cure decided to focus on the menu. A professional chef adviser helped Jung rework the menu by discarding items that weren’t necessary and creating the largest number of options with the least amount of ingredients and money.
They also switched the coffee to Groundwork Coffee, a local, organic coffee roaster.
“They have fresh minds, and they tried very hard to come up with new ideas for things like the menu and layout,” Jung said.
After completing the work over one weekend, DeClark and Cure are focused on marketing the café with its new renovations. They created a new logo and set up accounts on both Facebook and Twitter.
DeClark and Cure are planning more organized events at the Ragazzi Room in the future to increase its popularity among students, including possibly teaming up with the nearby Bacaro LA.
Ultimately, they are planning to step away from Ragazzi Room soon to allow it to be something self-sustaining that Jung can operate with the help of a dedicated staff.
Visitors to the café since the renovations have already noticed a significant difference, according to DeClark, and they are hoping the Ragazzi Room will continue to attract more students and become a popular gathering place once again.
“There’s something about the atmosphere here that hasn’t quite reached the surface yet,” Cure said. “This could be a great, beautiful place for people to come spend their time.”

what an awesome job Kory and Monica!
I avoid the Ragazzi b/c of the “B” score from the Dept. of Health.  I’ve worked at a coffee shop and I know how much you have to do wrong to get anything less than an A.  I really want to try it….. But the B is sketchy. :(
So I went and checked it out.  The coffee was great, the environment was great (My undergrad institution had tons of indy coffee shops and I missed that feel…), and the owner seemed really really nice.  Plus I finished my midterm! Which never happens when I work outside of Leavey or my office at home. So kudos, this place has tons of potential and I’ll come back. Oh and hopefully that B will turn into an A soon!
I love the Ragazzi room even more than I did before! Heart-warming story and Jay is a legend.

Concerned South Los Angeles community members hoping to effect noticeable change in the 8th Council District’s economy, education and public safety have organized a group to bring their needs to the forefront in anticipation of Tuesday’s City of Los Angeles municipal elections.
Movement · Two members of the Eighth District Grassroots Rising spoke in January at the People’s Convention about community issues. - Murugappan Aroonachalam | Daily Trojan 
Eighth District Grassroots Rising is an organization of members within the 8th Council District, which includes the USC area, that hopes to improve conditions in the area. EDGR was formed by leaders of the MA’AT Club for Community Change, another local grassroots organization in South Los Angeles.
The organization consists of leaders from local block clubs, neighborhood councils, social non-profits and other grassroots groups working together with area residents and businesses to demand a change in local government and district officials.
Greg Akili, a field director for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and an activist with EDGR, has lived in neighborhoods around South Los Angeles for 35 years and has seen the area undergo several changes. He said the issues of most concern include improving public safety, setting up a stronger public education system and providing effective health care to local residents.
Kokayi Kwa Jitahidi, the founder of the MA’AT Club and an activist in EDGR, agreed the struggle for jobs is one of the most pressing matters facing the district. He added that USC, as one of the area’s largest private employee, can assist by stressing local hiring initiatives in its upcoming projects.
The Rev. William Smart, another member of EDGR who lives in South Los Angeles and works for the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, stressed the importance of grassroots organizations in accomplishing their goals. In a situation where elected officials are not accomplishing what the people of 8th District want, he said, the people must speak out.
“Stop giving them a pass,” Smart said. “We need to make our demands clear and hold our leaders accountable.”
With incumbent City Councilman Bernard Parks up for re-election in this year, the members of EDGR see the coming days as a perfect opportunity to spread the word about their desire for change in the community.
To bring about the changes they believe are necessary for the 8th District, members of EDGR have been organizing local meetings of constituents and contacting their elected representatives.
Akili said the area needs elected officials who will respond to constituents’ needs and work together with local residents to improve the communities of South Los Angeles in terms of both their economies and overall community development.
“Planning decisions used to be imposed on residents and constituents, and we were treated as burdens or barriers rather than partners,” said Kevin Fridlington, a local resident of Leimert Park. “Our government has the responsibility to respond to us, the people, and we have the opportunity to make sure that happens with these elections.”
Fridlington lived in Manhattan Beach and West Hollywood before moving to Leimert Park, and said communities such as those flourish because of their resident involvement and planning. He believes the communities of South Los Angeles have the potential to do the same if people can rise to the challenge.
EDGR first came together in response to what many of its members saw as unfair hardships facing residents and stakeholders in the district, one of the poorest and most underserved in Los Angeles. They have focused on raising awareness about residents’ various concerns, which include the economy, education and neighborhood safety.
In January, EDGR hosted a People’s Convention at the Galen Center that brought together leaders of various organizations and concerned residents. At the gathering, the group drafted a “People’s Agenda,” which listed the needs and priorities of the 8th District from the constituents’ point of view, and sent it to community leaders and government officials.
“It starts with a set of demands,” Akili said. “The first demand for me would be engagement and action, because this leads to change. We have to hold each other and our elected officials accountable.”
Despite the list of difficulties facing the residents of the district, Akili said grassroots organizations like EDGR have the ability to change the status quo for people who have grown accustomed to not having everything they need.
“This community has a long and rich history,” Akili said. “We have succeeded, despite the fact that there may be some areas that we’re not always proud of. It’s that success that we have to build on.”

The intensity and emotion was palpable as host USC beat UCLA 5-2 Wednesday in a match where neither team was willing to give up without a long, hard fight.
Stellar · Freshman Emilio Gomez helped lead USC to victory over UCLA at home with his strong performances in doubles and singles play. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
USC freshman Emilio Gomez partnered with junior Daniel Nguyen to beat the Bruins’ Warren Hardie and Daniel Kosakowski 8-4. Gomez dominated in singles play, winning 6-2, 6-1 against Maxime Tabatruong.
“To have a freshman come through like Emilio is a big statement,” said USC coach Peter Smith. “He became a man against Stanford when he was down set points and came back and won. He continued that today.”
The Trojans (10-2) started doubles play down on all three courts, but would make a comeback to win 3-0 against the Bruins. Freshman Ray Sarmiento was back in the lineup with partner junior Steve Johnson after missing some play with a wrist injury that is still healing.
“Steve and I were just saying, we’ve got to make them play,” Sarmiento said. “Make them beat us. It went our way and we won.”
Johnson was visibly excited to have his teammate and partner back on the court with him. Although the pair started off down a break, they eventually rallied.
“I was excited,” Johnson said. “I know his wrist has been bothering him, but he’s a fighter. He’s going to give us our best chance to win. He put the team first, and that’s a big thing.”
Also in doubles play, senior Jaak Poldma and sophomore J.T. Sundling fought back against the Bruins’ Adrien Puget and Holden Seguso to win 8-6. Sundling, who suffered knee pain during his singles match against Seguso, fell 3-6, 2-6.
The Trojans’ dominance in doubles play was the nail in the coffin for the Bruins, who could never quite regain their momentum.
“I felt like if we won doubles, we would be good to win the match,” Smith said.
Still, the Bruins were aggressive and came to battle on the singles side, but USC went 4-2, with its only other singles loss from Nguyen in straight sets. Nguyen lost 4-6, 2-6, to Amit Inbar.
Johnson raked in a 6-2, 6-2 victory against Kosakowski to maintain his recent No. 1 national ranking.
“It’s exciting,” Johnson said. “I’ve worked hard this year and I think it was a goal of mine to get back to the top and keep it rolling from here.”
Poldma won his match against UCLA’s Clay Thompson 6-2, 6-3, and continued to show his veteran consistency and calm.
Even after the match had been decided, Sarmiento played on into a third set tiebreaker after being down 3-6, and coming back 6-4. He beat Puget 10-7 to take home the victory.
“I just told myself I wasn’t going to lose,” Sarmiento said. “No matter if we won the match or not. I wanted to have some pride. During singles I was not feeling well. I thought there was no way I was going to win this match, but I just kept sticking with it.”
Beating UCLA might technically be just another victory, but it is undoubtedly much more than that to USC.
“We haven’t beat them here since I’ve been here, so it was good for us to really go into the second half of our season with a big win against first Stanford and now UCLA,” Johnson said.

UCLA handed the USC women’s tennis team a humbling loss Wednesday, and one that USC coach Richard Gallien would like the team to put behind it.
It was a hard fall from grace for the Women of Troy (7-2) after their recent string of successes, especially with the loss coming at the hands of their archrival, the  Bruins.
“Today was combination of us not playing great and them playing really well,” Gallien said. “Our team is pretty darn experienced and we went out and played singles and lost.”
Another strong doubles showing, along with senior Maria Sanchez’s 17th consecutive singles victory, wasn’t enough for USC to push past UCLA’s talented bunch.
Although the match would start in the Bruins’ favor with a lopsided 8-0 victory for Noelle Hickey and McCall Jones against USC’s No. 10-ranked squad of sophomore Valeria Pulido and junior Alison Ramos, the Women of Troy quickly took the doubles portion with wins by Sanchez and freshman Kaitlyn Christian, and Lyndsay Kinstler and sophomore Danielle Lao tandems.
The singles matches, however, would yield far different results for Gallien’s squad.
Despite another stellar performance by No. 2 Sanchez, who beat McCall Jones 6-2, 7-6 (9), USC wouldn’t break through in any of the other five singles matches.
The usually consistent No. 18 Lao went down quietly in straight sets to UCLA senior Noelle Hickey. Throughout her 6-3, 6-3 defeat, Lao never seemed to get in any groove and exhausted most of her energy just trying to get herself back into contention.
Staying in the third slot, Christian saw her four-game winning streak snapped by UCLA’s No. 64-ranked senior Andrea Remynse. The 6-3, 6-1 loss for Christian guaranteed a Bruin victory, keeping Remynse’s record a perfect 6-0 in the third slot.
“The girl she played was, in my opinion, their best player,” Gallien said. “She might lose maybe two matches the rest of the season. Kaitlyn didn’t play her best and I think that over the long haul she’s going to do a good job at the higher slots.”
Gallien shuffled the lineup around once again this week, moving the red-hot Pulido to the No. 4 spot, where she squared off against UCLA sophomore Pamela Montez.
Pulido would see her eight-match streak snapped in quick fashion in the first singles match of the day, which ended 6-3, 6-1. Montez picked up her 20th win on the season and is looking to find herself nationally ranked once again.
It seems Ramos really can’t catch a break, losing her fourth consecutive match to No. 121 Courtney Dolehide of UCLA. A 10-point tiebreaker was needed to decide the victor as Ramos finally fell 6-3, 5-7 (10-7) in the final match of the day.
Relegated to the fifth spot, Ramos has found it difficult to finish games, especially against more physically-imposing players, such as the 6-0 Dolehide.
“Sometimes [it’s like] the old saying that if it wasn’t for bad luck we wouldn’t have any luck at all. She was fourth last year, and she’s lost some really tough matchups,” Gallien said of Ramos’ recent struggles. “At the end of the day she’s a really good player and if she keeps her head up it’ll turn around.”
UCLA’s Maya Johansson stayed undefeated out of the sixth slot (now 7-0), dispatching Cristala Andrews 6-2, 6-0 in fine fashion.
Despite the tough loss, Gallien had only positive words for both sides.  
“When it all goes on and shakes out, UCLA is probably a top-5 team in the country,” Gallien said. “We have every intention for our team to beat them when we meet them at home.”
Time to make a change with the Coach. Fifteen or sixteen years and one final four while on the man’s side back to back national championships the last two years. You have the #1/or 2 ranked player in college who wins the only singles match and a doubles set, and that is it. He has had four years since Sanchez came on board to put together a better squad than this. The fact that there were sanctions for one player making all those international telephone calls charged to the university seals the deal to find a new head coach.

Times announced for USC Spring football practice
USC football spring practice times have been set for 7:25 a.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays and 10:30 a.m. Saturdays, according to the athletic department.
Historically, practice times have typically been mid-to-late afternoon, around 4:00 p.m.
Spring practice begins March 22 and continues through the annual spring game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, scheduled for April 23 at 1 p.m.
The Trojans are coming off an 8-5 campaign and a third place finish in the Pac-10 during Lane Kiffin’s first season as USC’s coach.
Because its appeal of NCAA sanctions is still pending, it is unknown if USC will eligible to compete in a bowl game next season.
USC was barred from participating in the postseason in 2010.

Trojan football players found in police report
Seven USC football players were found to have police records, according to a recent report released by Sports Illustrated and CBS News.
The story, published on SI.com, was the result of a six-month investigation that involved criminal background checks on players listed on the rosters of every 2010 preseason top-25 team.
“Our coaches use a variety of methods to look into a recruit’s background, including those mentioned in the story,” said USC Athletic Director Pat Haden in a statement published in the Los Angeles Times. “On a case-by-case basis, if we feel it necessary, we’ll do a formalized background check.”
According to the report, seven percent of the 2,837 players had either been charged or cited for a crime.
Some players had been arrested multiple times. Of the 277 uncovered incidents, 40 percent were found to be for “serious” offenses.
“The story does raise some good issues,” Haden added. “We need to discuss internally if doing formal background checks becomes something that is factored in for the future here. It is certainly worth exploring.”
Pittsburgh finished atop the list with 22 players charged, while USC had the same number of players charged as three other schools: Florida, Ohio State and Oregon, which was 11th on SI’s list.
Race, however, was not a factor, according to the findings, as 48 percent of the players were black and 44.5 percent were white.
“[It is] a set of facts that obviously should concern all of us,” new NCAA president Mark Emmert told SI. “Seven percent, that’s way too high. I think two percent is too high. You certainly don’t want a large number of people with criminal backgrounds involved in activities that represent the NCAA.”
Of the 277 incidents in which a player was charged and an outcome to the case was made available, the individual was found guilty or paid some penalty  60 percent of the time.

Cynthia cooper to be recognized
The No. 44 jersey Cynthia Cooper wore during her time at USC will be retired this Sunday at the USC-Washington women’s basketball game, scheduled to begin at 12:30 p.m.
Cooper will become the third USC women’s basketball player ever to have her jersey retired, joining Cheryl Miller and Lisa Leslie.
Now known as Cynthia Cooper-Dyke, the former USC standout is currently the head coach at the University of North Carolina Wilmington.
Cooper-Dyke holds several records at USC. She is the No. 9 all-time scorer, No. 3 all-time in steals and No. 7 all-time in games played and assists.
During her four-year career at USC, she helped lead the team to back-to-back NCAA championships in 1983 and 1984.
Cooper-Dyke was also a 1982 WBCA Freshman All-American and a 1986 All-Pac-10 first-team selection.
In the WNBA, she averaged 21 points per game and nearly five assists per game. In her time with the Houston Comets, she helped lead the team to four consecutive WNBA titles from 1997 to 2000.
In April 2010, she was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame — one of only 13 women players to be given that honor.

With just two games left in the regular season, the women’s basketball team is projected to be the “first team out” of the NCAA tournament, according to ESPN.com.
That means if the tournament was seeded today, USC (16-11, 8-8) would be left out of the 64-team field.
Bounce back · Senior guard Jacki Gemelos and the Women of Troy look to end to their losing streak against the Washington schools. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
If the Women of Troy are going to prove that prediction wrong, they have no margin for error against Washington State and Washington in their final home stand of the year, which starts tonight against Washington State (8-20, 6-10) at 7 p.m.
The increased urgency has been brought about by an alarming road trip last week, when USC lost both its games to fellow bubble contenders Arizona State and Arizona.
“After those two losses, we’re hungry and we want to beat these two Washington schools,” said senior guard Jacki Gemelos. “We know how important [each game] is from this point on.”
The two losses dropped USC into a tie for fourth-place in the Pac-10 with Arizona.
Both schools own 8-8 conference records and trail Arizona State by one game.
The two teams who end up finishing fourth and fifth will play each other in the second round of the Pac-10 tournament next week.
“You can’t be sad [about losses] for too long, because we have two huge games coming up that could really help us for the tournament,” Gemelos said.
Fortunately for USC, the Cougars are coming into Los Angeles on a cold streak, failing to secure a single victory in their recent three-game home stand.
Washington State has also lost four of its last five games.
USC cannot take the Cougars lightly, however, as last year, it fell to them at the Galen Center, 63-52.
With Washington State out of contention for a NCAA tournament bid, it could still play the role of spoiler and play for pride.
The Cougars will be looking to improve upon their best conference record in a decade — the last time Washington State finished with six conference wins was the 2000-01 season.
Freshman forward Sage Romberg leads Washington State with 9.3 points per game, but the team relies on its depth to compete.
The Cougars have no player averaging double-digit scoring, but have eight players who score more than five points per game, and nine players who average more than 10 minutes of playing time per game.
Meanwhile, USC relies on Gemelos and junior guards Ashley Corral and Briana Gilbreath. All three average more than 10 points per game.
More important than what the Women of Troy do on the offensive end will be what they do on the other end of the court.
USC has four players ranked in the top-20 in rebounding (Gilbreath, sophomore Christina Marinacci, freshman Cassie Harberts and senior center Kari LaPlante) in the Pac-10, but Washington State has none.
When the Women of Troy have outrebounded their opponents this season, they are 11-0.
Conversely, when they lose the rebounding edge, they are 5-11.
In USC’s previous games this season against both Washington squads, the Women of Troy outrebounded and outscored their opponents. They beat the Cougars 72-57 and the Huskies 60-51.
If the Women of Troy sweep the Washington schools and make a run in the Pac-10 tournament, they will likely be able to participate in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2006.
“It would be so amazing to [make the tournament],” Gemelos said. “We’re going to do everything in our power to get there.”

Four years ago, a skinny basketball player from Montenegro decided to take his talents to the United States.
After playing three years of high-school basketball in Europe, Nikola Vucevic traveled to the States, hoping to make his way to the NBA and enjoy the same success his parents had when they starred on the hardwood.
His dad, Borislav, played professionally for 24 years and was a member of the Yugoslavian national team while his mother, Ljiljana, played professional basketball in Bosnia.
In other words, Vucevic had natural talent. In 2007, he was voted the best young player in Montenegro.
After coming to the United States, he did not disappoint in his lone year at Stoneridge Prep, averaging 18 points and 12 rebounds and attracting the attention of several colleges.
Ultimately, of course, he chose USC.
The 2008-09 season that Vucevic arrived on campus, however, USC’s squad was already loaded with talent.
DeMar DeRozan had the campus buzzing about his potential, while Taj Gibson, Dwight Lewis and Daniel Hackett all held solid roles on the team.
And before his USC career even began, Vucevic was forced to miss the first eight games of the season while he confirmed his amateur status with the NCAA.
Once cleared, his minutes were sparse playing behind Gibson, Keith Wilkinson and Leonard Washington.
But that offseason, DeRozan and Gibson declared for the NBA draft, Hackett went to play basketball professionally overseas, Wilkinson graduated and Washington transferred schools.
Amid all the change, Vucevic was thrust into a starting role. He responded in a big way, becoming a consistent low-post presence on the offensive and defensive end.
Then, the university self-imposed sanctions on the basketball team midway through the season.
Despite all the turmoil, Vucevic was a source of reliability and consistency the entire year. He started all 30 games for USC, while finishing second on the team in scoring (10.7) and first in rebounding (9.4).
He was recognized for his strong play, and was named the Pac-10’s Most Improved Player last season.
Vucevic’s breakout season might have been a surprise to many who didn’t know him, but it was this type of skill that Montenegro under-20 coach Dejan Radonjic knew he had. 
“He’s a great guy, an excellent talent,” Radonjic said in an interview with Chris Hein who covers FIBA basketball. “I think he will be a big star.”
Now in his third year at USC, Vucevic has gone from a relative unknown to No. 1 option.
And he a greater source of points and rebounds, leading the team in both categories.
He certainly made his case to be the Pac-10 Player of the Year, ranking third in scoring (17.5 points) and leading the conference in rebounding (10.3).
Vucevic has also registered 18 double-doubles on the season, and is a big reason why the Trojans’ record is what it is.
Because of his recent stellar play, he was named Pac-10 Player of the Week for the first time in his USC career.
The fans have taken notice, too.
With the possibility of Vucevic leaving after this year, fans and students chanted “One more year, one more year” during last week’s final home game of the season against Arizona State.
Although it’s only been three years since Vucevic became a Trojan, it’s been a sight to see him develop into the player he is today.
The skinny basketball player from Montenegro was once overshadowed by his teammates, but is now making a name for himself.
The player known as “Kid Euro” is no longer a kid anymore.
He’s growing up before our very eyes.

Washington State guard Klay Thompson does not miss a lot of shots.
The junior leads the Pac-10 with 81 three-point shots made, converts 41.2 percent of his three-pointers and 90.3 percent of his free throws.
Lockdown · Senior guard Marcus Simmons, best known for his defensive prowess, has earned a reputation as one of the best defenders in the Pac-10 and arguably the nation. Tonight, he will guard Klay Thompson, who leads the Pac-10 in scoring with 21.2 points per contest. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
When the Cougars (18-10, 8-8) lost to the Trojans, 60-56, in the Galen Center on New Year’s Eve, however, Thompson struggled to score. With senior guard Marcus Simmons shadowing his every move, Thompson missed 12 of his 18 shots, including his first six attempts of the game.
Despite getting the better of Thompson in their first match-up, Simmons knows he will have his hands full tonight when the two teams meet in Pullman, Wash. at 7 p.m.
“I expect him to be more aggressive, especially since he is playing at home,” Simmons said.
But Thompson has played well as of late. He has averaged 28 points and four three-point baskets made per game in his last three contests.
His 21.2 points per game average is more than two points higher than the next best scorer in the Pac-10.
“He is going to get points,” said USC coach Kevin O’Neill. “We are not going to shut him out. That is impossible, because he is too good. We need to make sure that we defend him as a group, and help Marcus as much as we can.”
As talented as Thompson is, the Cougars are far from a one-man team.
Junior guard Faisal Aden averages 12.6 points per game, although a sore knee has slowed him recently.
Washington State has benefited from increased production from junior forward DeAngelo Casto. In his last six games, he has averaged 15.5 points and eight rebounds per game.
The Cougars are coming off a convincing 80-69 victory over Washington on Sunday, completing the regular season sweep against their cross-state rival.
The Trojans (17-12, 9-7) have also experienced success in recent games.
USC has won four consecutive games for the first time this season after sweeping the two Arizona schools last weekend.
O’Neill made two changes that have contributed to the Trojans’ winning streak.
He inserted senior guard Donte Smith into the starting lineup to give USC an outside shooting threat, while allowing freshman guard Maurice Jones to provide a spark off the bench.
“Teams cannot double-team me as much as they used to because Donte is a good shooter,” said junior forward Nikola Vucevic.
O’Neill also cancelled Friday practices between Thursday and Saturday Pac-10 conference games to allow the Trojans, who only have seven players in their regular rotation, to rest.
Along with the extra rest, and its rejuvenated guard play, Vucevic has been instrumental in the team’s recent victories.
In the Trojans’ four game winning streak, Vucevic averaged 21.3 points and 11.5 rebounds per game. He has six consecutive double-doubles, and is the reigning Pac-10 Player of the Week.  
“If there is a guy any more valuable to his team [than Vucevic], I would like to see him,” O’Neill said. “We all know where we would be without [him].”
The upcoming final road trip of the regular season has significant implications for the Trojans’ seeding in the Pac-10 tournament at Staples Center, which begins on Wednesday.
USC is currently in fourth place in the Pac-10. The Trojans only trail third-place Washington by one game, while several teams could leapfrog USC in the standings if the Trojans falter.
“I am not hoping for one scenario or another,” O’Neill said. “We are just going to play the games and see where we are at the end of the season.”
The Trojans conclude the regular season against Washington on Saturday at 7:30 p.m.

Movie of the Week:
I Saw The Devil — Nuart Theatre — Opens Friday
For the past decade, South Korea has remained one of the most consistent exporters of thrilling, intelligent cinema. The latest film from Kim Jee-woon, I Saw The Devil has already shaken up audiences at Sundance, and will play for a limited week-long engagement at the Nuart Theatre starting tomorrow.
The premise is at once repugnant and intriguing. The great Choi Min-sik portrays a brutish serial killer whose latest victim is the pregnant fiancée of Dae-hoon (Lee Byung-hyun), a government agent. Consumed with the fantasy of revenge like so many doomed figures before him, Dae-hoon begins a vicious hunt for the killer, shedding every shred of his humanity and moral decency in the process.
These days, only a Korean filmmaker could get away with a premise this grim. From Chen-wook Park’s Lady Vengeance to Kim Ki-duk’s Bad Guy, the nation’s auteurs have continually taken the coarsest of material from the Tarantino bucket and made it flourish with visual imagination and the poetic screams of Plath and Catullus. Whether the trend will continue with I Saw The Devil remains to be seen, but the odds are unnervingly strong.
Music Video of the Week: 
“Need You Now” — Cut Copy
The trap that all indie pop acts risk falling into is that of self-seriousness — believing the grandiose raves of Pitchfork and Brooklyn Vegan to the point of an embarrassing downfall. Thankfully, Australian disco revivalists Cut Copy have gamely averted that pitfall with their latest music video for “Need You Now,” the first track off of their recent Zonoscope.
Directed by Keith Schofield and shot before a simple painted backdrop of Los Angeles, the video features frontman Dan Whitford and Co. at their instruments as a caravan of athletes runs around them in all directions like badly garbed electrons. Given the song’s aching tone, this explosion of day-glo, nunchucks and tennis balls is particularly arresting, not to mention hilarious. Keep your eyes peeled for the video’s highlight: a Grizzly Adams-esque hockey player whacking a bowling ball toward the camera with a tennis racket.
After many slow motion closeups of all the “players” involved, the video crumbles into violence as the athletes take up medieval weapons and go Braveheart on each other while the band begins the song’s gorgeous breakdown. Where this bizarre idea came from is as great a mystery as how Whitford manages to make black jeans and a button-down work shirt look so effortlessly cool.
Still, the video is a comforting assurance that Cut Copy walks with the same balance of passion and self-deprecation wielded by Talking Heads, LCD Soundsystem and other legends of dance pop.
Song of the Week: 
“You’re So Right” — The Strokes — RCA — Streaming on NME.com
“Under Cover of Darkness” was a pleasant, if predictable, return to form for The Strokes, but “You’re So Right,” the second released track from its forthcoming LP Angles, is an entirely different beast.
Beginning with a snarl of looped guitars and a foreboding bass riff, the track is an unusually synthetic work for the New York garage quintet. Julian Casablancas’ vocals are bizarrely filtered and layered, sometimes beyond recognition, as the song builds toward a brilliantly spare breakdown of dissonant cries and, finally, some serious shredding.
Tonally, “You’re So Right” is a bleak outing for The Strokes, inviting curiosity as to what other surprises the new album might hold. Casablancas has already said of the song, “I had some early REM vibes for a minute or two. It’s a darker one.” Let’s hope the band’s other influences and byproducts are also as sonically interesting.

As we all probably know by now, the key to a happy and healthy life is to enjoy food in moderation and eat fewer processed foods.
Michelle Obama knows this as well as anyone, and has used her prominent position to promote healthier eating and fight childhood obesity in America with her “Let’s Move!” campaign.
It is, of course, only one of her many causes as first lady, alongside supporting military families, promoting art education and the arts, so on and so forth. But for whatever reason, the issue of healthier eating has easily been the most contentious with critics.
Representative Michelle Bachmann (R-Minn.), for instance, said Michelle Obama’s suggestion that mothers breast-feed their children more (as breast-fed babies are less likely to become obese) was an example of the “nanny state” President Obama is trying to set up. The tip, Bachmann claimed, was “very consistent with where the hard left is coming from,” since it believes “government is the answer to every problem.”
Maybe a little hyperbolic, but sure.
Sarah Palin also chimed in by saying Michelle Obama’s efforts are a perfect example of “government thinking that they need to take over and make decisions for us.”
With these fightin’ words spewed all over The New York Times, I couldn’t help but wonder what Bachmann or Palin think about obesity. What do they think should be done about it? That parents should be the only ones speaking out against it?
Well, that would be a grand plan, but for a few minor caveats. After all, wouldn’t these be the same parents encouraging you to have another helping? Or perhaps the ones that already have a tough time figuring out how to eat healthy themselves?
Or maybe Bachmann and Palin feel that obesity isn’t really the epidemic that it’s cracked up to be, and that it’s just a temporary problem we can ignore?
They aren’t the only ones speaking out, of course. Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio talk show host notorious for his vitriolic rants against President Obama and the left, suggested Michelle Obama was a hypocrite for chowing down on barbecued ribs, and slyly made negative comments about the first lady’s own waistline.
It’s difficult to try to imagine what inspired these pointed attacks on a campaign that has been as inoffensive as Michelle Obama’s.
She has encouraged such radical ideas as consuming smaller portions of food, eating locally and organically when possible and planting gardens.
These concepts, apparently, are the ones that have incited the accusations of a “nanny state.” If that sounds a little ridiculous, it’s probably because it is.
Listening to critics of Michelle Obama’s causes, it sounds as if the first lady has thrown the country into some culinary gulag, where proud American citizens are threatened with death if their hands stray toward non-organic beef broth.
But the first lady is doing no such thing. She’s helping us remember what we’ve always known, but have strayed from: we benefit from eating less, eating healthier and exercising more. Even a child can understand the elegance of that simple solution to an ever-growing obesity epidemic.
The adult obesity rate in the United States is the highest in the developed world, with 34.3 percent of the country’s adults obese, according to the Center for Disease Control’s website.
The CDC’s statistics also reveal that childhood obesity in those aged six to 11, although lower than the adult rate, still more than tripled in the last 30 years, jumping from 6.5 percent in 1980 to 19.6 percent in 2008.
With this in mind, the fact that some, such as Bachmann and Palin, would steal the spotlight from Michelle Obama’s cause to spout exaggerated claims of an overly controlling government should raise some eyebrows.
What harm, exactly, will come of tending a small garden in the backyard? A tan?
In the same way we can figure out that eating healthier is probably good for us, we should also reason that indulging once in a while isn’t going to destroy your heart and soul.
Yes, the first lady’s willingness to eat some pork ribs or have a Super Bowl party full of the traditional junk foods seems in conflict with her speeches about being food-conscious. But anyone who loves food also knows that knowing when and how to indulge is the key to maintaining a healthy body.
Both sides of this story are worth keeping in mind as we head into a relaxing spring break filled, hopefully, with delicious meals.
Michelle Obama’s critics, who only see the looming nanny state within her encouragements, are exaggerating. Maybe during spring break they should not include so much George Orwell reading.

Most athletes think of Bottle Blenders (a convenient container used to mix protein powder with your beverage of choice on the fly) and a satisfying workout as the key to getting a toned body. For some athletes, no workout is complete without some sort of health supplement. But many might ask, are supplements necessary?
 The juice · There are many supplement concoctions to choose from, but the ultimate decision comes down to the individual needs of the buyer. - Mindy Curtis | Daily Trojan 
Many supplements on the market promise, and often exaggerate, great results. Supplements are not well regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, allowing companies to make bold claims without any pressure to back them up.
But there is something to be said for protein powder. During the course of a good workout, muscle fibers are torn. Protein powder helps repair these fibers quickly. Although protein can be found in various meats and legumes, protein powder offers a convenient source for those who exercise several times a week.
The most important step, though, is selecting the right protein powder. GNC and Vitamin Shoppe shelves are stocked with hundreds of supplements claiming extraordinary benefits. Basically, though, there are only three types of protein to consider.
Whey protein is quick-digesting, and best before and after workouts. Casein protein is most often used when a person won’t have access to protein for a few hours, such as just before bed. Soy protein is a slightly less effective alternative to whey protein, but good for people with whey protein allergies.
Beyond this, protein is basically protein. Choose one that suits your price and taste.
Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein by Optimum Nutrition
The title Gold Standard is not just an advertising tool. This is the M-16 of protein powder in its versatility and cost-effectiveness. At the Vitamin Shoppe, a 5.15 pound container runs about $45.
Prolab N-large
With plenty of carbs and protein, N-large will also build muscle, but mass. For those looking to move up the weight scale, this brings noticeable results within a few weeks. A 10-pound case is approximately $60, but each serving is a hefty four scoops. Thankfully, the extra carbs give this a great taste.
Muscle Milk premade shakes
These rank among the better premade protein shakes in terms of taste. They are sweet and provide a good dose of protein and amino acids without having to blend powder and milk. Muscle Milk shakes range in price based on the size, but a 12-pack costs around $30.
If the results of protein powder leave you wanting more, consider looking into creatine powder. Creatine gives more energy and increases water retention, keeping muscles larger and more defined. Increased water retention, however, requires constant hydration, so be sure to have extra water bottles on hand.
Although creatine comes in the form of pills and chewables, powder is found to be the most effective. The benefits of creatine only last as long as it stays in the system, so if you stop using it, musculature will gradually become less apparent.
EAS Pro Science PUSH Creatine
This brand is reliable but lacks a palatable taste and is a little overpriced. PUSH should be taken an hour before working out, but can also be used at different times of the day. You can buy a pack of 14 online for about $40.
Optimum Nutrition Pre-load Creatine Complex
Pre-load works similarly to EAS PUSH, except that it is specialized for use before exercise. Though it lacks versatility, it tastes better than the former option. Like Optimum Nutrition’s Gold Standard Protein, it comes at a reasonable price, at 4 pounds for $20.
MuscleTech naNO Vapor
This supplement is a more powerful one that offers an increase in nitric oxide and also contains creatine. It essentially raises workout potential for an hour or two after consumption. It might cause jitters, so use in moderation. Two pounds costs $49.99.
Before considering these supplements, decide if your style of exercise justifies their use. Supplements will not help very much if there isn’t a strong foundation of committed effort. The best results come from investing the energy in the first place. Supplements are ultimately there just to speed up the process.
For the average person who wants to simply stay fit, protein powder and creatine aren’t necessary. But for those who want more defined muscles or help maintaining their strength,  supplements can be sampled to further improve strength or definition.
People should concentrate on the way they eat before they even consider any supplements. Generally supplements are worthless since they contain zero phytonutrients and zero fibre.
Do your hip pocket a favour and eat natural, clean food instead – 80-90% plant based.
@Mike-You are completely correct.  On top of being expensive, most supplements are not proven to be bioavailable and are passed right through your body with little benefit.  Many are full of “extras”  melamine and such.  Most do not contain what is stated on the label.  In order to combat oxidative stress induced by exercise althletes should be eating fruits and veggies on trough sized portions.
Eat real food, all parts of the plant, all colors of the rainbow each day!

The Libyan uprising is turning into a humanitarian crisis.
Colonel Muammar Gaddafi has attacked protestors with a relentless fury to hold onto his power.
The international powers have not done enough to end this crisis.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
The United States has imposed severe sanctions on Gaddafi’s regime, frozen $30 billion in Libyan assets, moved naval and air forces closer to Libya and sent two humanitarian teams to the Middle East to aid the refugees who have been displaced as a result of the bloodshed.
The European Union issued travel bans to Libyan leaders and the Gaddafi family and proposed a 60-day economic embargo on the regime to prevent Gaddafi from using oil and other revenue to repress his people.
The United Nations has also sanctioned the Gaddafi regime, imposed an arms embargo on Libya, frozen the assets of its leaders, referred the case to the International Criminal Court’s lead Prosecutor for possible crimes against humanity and, most recently, suspended Libya from the U.N. Human Rights Council.
Unfortunately, these measures take time to have a real effect — time the Libyan people are quickly running out of.
The death toll in Libya remains unconfirmed, but the estimates are around 1,000 people. And Tuesday, the U.N. Refugee Agency reported that 140,000 people fled Libya to Egypt and Tunisia.
On Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon emphatically urged the world to act against the repressive Libyan regime, as “history’s most tragic chapters are written when we fail to heed that call. Let us not fall short.”
That action needs to come from multiple sources, and students are a viable group to begin the dialogue.
As students, we should condemn leaders who use deadly force against their own people.
A widespread rally or a mass protest on university campuses across the nation would send a message to politicians and leaders.
Student action is crucial to spurring worldwide reaction to the Libyan uprising. Hopefully, it can help begin the process of deposing Gaddafi.
The U.N. can lack international authority because U.N.-led action depends on the solidarity and cooperation between, at the very least, the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
On the other hand, U.N.-led action would be extremely effective and pragmatic if the members of the Security Council can agree on a stronger response to Gaddafi.
It might be impossible to coalesce countries on the Security Council like Russia and China into escalating their response.
Russia supports the U.N. sanctions against Libya although it could lose up to $4 billion in arms trade with Libya. But on Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov condemned the idea of implementing a no-fly zone over Libya.
China, which recently succeeded in evacuating 35,000 Chinese nationals working in Libya, has commonly turned a blind eye to human rights abuses in its interactions with foreign countries, especially in the Middle East and Africa.
It would be surprising if China committed its military to the defense of foreign citizens.
Getting Russia and China to agree to a multilateral response that includes military involvement might be what’s necessary to simultaneously stop the humanitarian crisis limitations.
The international community needs to mount a stronger response to Gaddafi.
Imposing a no-fly zone could be an effective measure to stop Gaddafi from attacking his people.
Enlisting regional organizations in Africa and the Middle East, such as the African Union or the Arab League, to aid the situation would also uproot the notion that western democracies are manipulating the Libyan crisis.
Having said this, neither the U.N. nor the United States can rebuild Libya.
That burden rests solely on the shoulders of the Libyan people, but it is still our responsibility to help them.

The House of Representatives approved a series of budget cuts totaling about $61 billion dollars on Feb. 19.
These budget cuts will affect a slew of government organizations, most notably Planned Parenthood, which, according to its website, is the nation’s leading sexual and reproductive health care provider for both males and females.
Approximately $317 million will be detracted from Planned Parenthood’s funding if this proposal is passed in the Senate and signed by President Obama.
Yes, the United States is in the midst of a devastating financial crisis and our country’s debt is in the trillions and rising.
Cutting spending from Planned Parenthood, however, is most definitely not an appropriate solution.
Considering the House is overwhelmingly Republican and the Senate is Democratic, the bill will hopefully be defeated.
Still, the fact that members of the House felt detracting funding from Planned Parenthood was a good idea in the first place raises a series of important questions.
Are female reproductive rights being made a political issue, rather than a personal issue?
And are political figures throttling female reproductive rights for the sake of budget cuts?
Speaker of the House John Boehner explained to the Los Angeles Times that in voting to remove funding from Planned Parenthood, the House was simply “carrying out the will of the voters who sent nearly 100 new Republicans to Washington in November.”
Based on previous conservative voting patterns,  however, the proposed withdrawal of funds appears largely based on the fact that Planned Parenthood provides abortion services at its clinics.
Pro-life voters who sent new representatives to Capitol Hill deserve to be heard — but in this case, the House just might have gone too far.
Currently, no federal funding goes toward abortion. In fact, ninety-seven percent of the program’s funding, in fact, goes to preventive care services, such as breast cancer and prostate cancer screenings. In addition to preventive care services, the money goes toward funding for HIV tests and birth control.
It is therefore logical to deduce that if this bill is passed in the Senate and is not vetoed by President Obama, millions of women, men and families will be affected.
If that’s not bad enough, consider this: Planned Parenthood is the only form of medical treatment that 60 percent of its patients will receive throughout the entire year.
Yet ironically, the House decided to keep the $7.4 million the Army uses to sponsor a NASCAR driver.
I indisputably support the ideologies of all — pro-life and pro-choice. I applaud the Republican representatives for listening to their constituents’ desires.
Yet the issue at hand does not deal with the question of whether or not the U.S. government condones abortion.
True, Planned Parenthood does provide abortion services, but none of the money allocated to it is used for these services.
All abortions are privately funded. Thus, Boehner’s argument for using Planned Parenthood’s abortion services as an excuse to eradicate funding is flawed because in reality, Planned Parenthood provides an abundance of services that benefit both genders and both parties of our society.

Great article planned parenthood needs to be funded.. Obama stop supporting Irack war and support  PP  once and far all……
Planned Parenthood is Blood-Thirsty. They lie & deceive for the purpose of murdering little kids who looked just like you & I when we were their age. These kids experience the pain of being torn to shreds or aborted by saline injections. Why the hell should you or I pay for this ugly practice? Because making money by killing little kids is a “Hard Sell” to the public, so they enlist government help, mostly Atheists & Democrats, to further their practice. Wake Up! It’s not that hard to figure out. Planned Parenthood cannot be trusted. Even their name is a lie…they give NO credit to our Maker for making us…it’s “all” up to OUR planning. We need to abort this from all our budgets … State & National. It is a dangerous weed that will suck the life out of all of us. Not convinced? Watch a movie of an actual abortion taking place…e.g. Silent Scream. See what actually takes place in these procedures. The ruthless OBJECTIFICATION of women  has a price.
Planned Parenthood is a for profit corporation disguising itself as a charity. Every dollar sent to PP is two dollars in new debt to taxpayers. Presently, monthly federal overspending our tax receipts is more than the entire annual budget of California – the largest state. We need to cut back now – PP is just one of many extras that needs to start standing on its own.
That’s an incredibly narrow view of a huge issue.  Cutting budgets for non profits and social services before considering the vast other expenses (for instance, ALL of the taxes we give to pharmacies and corporations, the HUGE amount of money the government spends on itself, the fact that we refuse to tax the few people who hold about 50% of our country’s economic welfare in their bank accounts..) is a complete defacing of the priority of our country to survive.  This kind of move will create upset, and people are already galvanizing.  We all pay for things we don’t necessarily support, what the House and Senate should be considering is what we are paying for that doesn’t immediately serve a citizens best interest.  Planned Parenthood is undeniably a hugely needed form of health care and provides services to people who otherwise would have no method of helping themselves.  
As someone who works for a nonprofit, it is disgusting to see how quickly people are making a decision to defund a whole community of helpless people.  For instance, in the deveopmental disabilities community, cost containment has caused hundreds of people who literally cannot help themselves to go homeless, and the people who are lucky enough to still be in a surviving developmental disabilities nonprofit are going into debt more and more every year because Social Security disability literally won’t cover cost of living anymore.  Social services are the only way that we address the people who have no other help or options, and they don’t need to be under any more attack than they already have been.  You want to save your tax dollars?  Get rid of our absurd and useless war budget.  Tax the wealthy.  Go where the money is, for God’s sake.  Isn’t that the smart thing to do in the end, or has everyone gone batty?
In terms of what it says about Planned Parenthood, this post could not be more incorrect.  First of all Planned Parenthood is a NON profit.  Second of all there is conclusive research showing that every dollar spent on family planning saves this country almost $4 in public health care costs.  It makes no sense to cut this program.

A bill proposing to end federal funding of Planned Parenthood recently passed the House, and some people are not t0o happy about that.
Concerned citizens have created Facebook pages declaring their opposition to the Pence Amendment, citing a concerning disregard for women’s rights and the provision of basic healthcare to low-income families.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Even passed through the Senate and signed into law, though, the bill will not trample women’s rights, nor will it prevent people who are in need of services offered by Planned Parenthood from receiving them.
Social conservatives have long vilified Planned Parenthood for providing abortions, so it’s not surprising a Republican proposed the bill. U.S. Representative Mike Pence (R-Ind.) saw an opportunity to promote an ideological agenda through legislation, a fact he hasn’t hidden.
On his website, Pence states his moral opposition to abortion and says it is “morally wrong to take the taxpayer dollars of millions of pro-life Americans and use them to fund organizations that provide and promote abortions.”
Under the Title X Family Planning program, the federal government is required to provide funds to institutions, whether public or private, that offer family planning and related health services.
Planned Parenthood cannot legally use taxpayer dollars to perform abortions, however. But it is likely still disconcerting to many pro-life and pro-choice people that their money is going to an organization that performs more abortions every year.
Even if federal grants aren’t being applied directly toward abortion procedures, the idea that people’s tax money provides such substantial financial support begs the question of whether we are keeping those who support pro-choice in business, or even supporting them with our own money.
Either way, the Pence Amendment does not invalidate Title X, nor does it decrease the amount of federal funding provided through its application.
This means opponents’ cries that the bill encroaches on women’s rights and prevents low-income people from receiving treatment are essentially irrelevant.
Instead of keeping women and low-income citizens from receiving treatment altogether, passing the Pence Amendment into law would mean that they would go to other clinics that would be improved by a reallocation of Title X funds.
People would have more options to receive care at many different clinics that are not notorious for providing abortions as an oft-used form of family planning.
In directing funding away from Planned Parenthood and into other family planning organizations that are often marginalized, women will be better able to receive quality care, resources and unbiased information with the help of more widely and fairly distributed Title X funds.
There is a reason the bill received relatively bipartisan support in the House (10 Democrats voted to pass the Pence Amendment).
Not only does it allow for continued government support of women and families in need of assistance, but it also has the potential to steer those women and families away from abortion as a solution without taking away their right to choose.
To claim the Pence Amendment would harm women and families in need and take away choices is illogical. If anything, it would help women.
Women’s rights are not under attack here. Passage of the bill into law would arguably empower women by giving them more choices beyond abortion-happy Planned Parenthood.
Instead of just benefiting one organization, the Pence Amendment aims to give women and their families more choices and give the taxpayers a little peace of mind that their money is being put to better use.

Between this and the Kappa Sig fiasco, I’m really ashamed to be a USC alumnae. This anti-female rhetoric is appalling.
Miss Cueva, perhaps your religiously-motivated views would be better suited at Azuza or Biola and not USC. I think they teach you that humans and dinosaurs walked on Earth together there, too.
As a journalist, it is important that you separate the opinions you hold that are based on feelings separate from the ones you hold that are based on evidence.  What you feel is legitimate, and in reality, nobody can challenge you on you personal feelings about abortion. The error you made in your article is that you misrepresented data and used partial, out-of-context facts to support your feelings; this is where your readers ripped your article to pieces.  If your feelings about an issue cannot be swayed by objective facts, you need to own that reality rather than disguise it.  You are, at this point, following in the footsteps of  Rush Limbaugh, Cal Thomas, and Mike Rosen, who line up their “facts” to support positions they already hold.  You would better serve your readers if you emulated Kathleen Parker or George Will, conservatives who do not distort evidence in support of opinions based on feelings.
The article fails to mention the author is a far-right wing christian republican but I’m sure you all figured that out by now after seeing the logic used in this article.
Methinks this Sarah Cueva is a troll too. :)
“…Pence states his moral opposition to abortion and says it is “morally wrong to take the taxpayer dollars of millions of pro-life Americans and use them to fund organizations that provide and promote abortions.””
Hmm…That’s funny. I find it morally wrong that Americans have to pay the salaries of Republican politicians who try to legislate people’s reproductive rights. Go figure…
Wow! I have never read such a terribly baseless article in the DT and am very embarrassed that this was published by a USC student. Is there no editing process? Sarah Cueva should be ashamed.
“Abortion Happy” planned parenthood?
“Abortion comprises only 3% of all services. 36% is contraception, 31% is STI treatment/testing, 17% is cancer screening and prevention.”
Do some research SARAH CUEVA!
300,000 plus abortions per year with a bullet!!!  #1 in the Country and proud of it
Sarah, your commentors are writing better, more informative articles than you.  At least you have pissed them off enough to put some effort into it.
“the bill received relatively bipartisan support in the House (10 Democrats voted to pass the Pence Amendment).”
Seriously? Are you kidding me? You call 10 Democrats and and 230 Republicans “relatively bi-partisan”? 96% of the votes FOR this amendment were from Republicans. And 96% of the votes AGAINST this amendment were from Democrats. That is the definition of partisanship, and it is incredibly disingenuous to assert otherwise.
Did you do any research at all before writing this article? 
Planned Parenthood is not “abortion happy”–what an incredibly unprofessional and (quite frankly) bitchy statement. Abortions account for less than 3% of services provided by Planned Parenthood. They are far more involved in STD screening, treatment, and prevention; birth control; cancer screenings; well-woman exams; pre-natal care and information for expecting mothers, especially low income mothers who cannot access services elsewhere; etc.
PP alone prevents more than 600,000 unintended pregnancies every year. Statistically speaking, if these had not been prevented, 40% would have ended in abortion (in simpler terms: 40% of unintended pregnancies end in abortion). Thus, PP *prevents* a minimum of 240,000 abortions every year.
Defunding Planned Parenthood does NOT mean abortions will stop. PP doesn’t use federal funding to perform abortions to begin with. Defunding PP means MORE abortions–because it means you are taking away access to safe, effective, AFFORDABLE, and reliable birth control methods (IUDs, the large variety of contraceptive pills, female condoms, male condoms, depo shots, nuva-ring, morning-after pills, etc.). It also means MORE unhealthy pregnancies because you are taking away vital pre-natal care to low income women who want to carry their pregnancies to term. You are also taking away breast cancer screenings, cervical cancer screenings, PAP smears, treatment for UTIs, screening and treatment for STDs and HIV, educational resources on safe sex, healthy pregnancies, etc.
While abortion may not be something you personally approve of or would CHOOSE for your own uterus (ah yes, the beauty of choice), basing your objection to PP on abortion services is incredibly misguided. You want to end funding for the 97% of services that you can and should support because of some 3% of services that don’t receive federal funding to begin with. Do you see the ridiculous lack of logic here?
I support a woman’s right to choose an abortion when that is the best option for her. And I support a woman’s right to choose to carry a pregnancy to term when THAT is the best option for her. And yes, there are absolutely times when choosing abortion is the BEST choice. But when it comes down to it, it is the woman’s choice. Not yours. Not the government’s.
As for “forcing pro-life Americans to fund organizations they disagree with”–I am forced to help fund the murder and thousands of Afghani and Iraqi citizens every year in the wars we have been waging that I have never supported. I am forced to fund state executions that I vehemently oppose. I am forced to fund assistance to governments like Mubarak’s Egypt and the Israeli military, both of which have been responsible for massive human rights violations, all documented and condemned by multiple sources. My tax dollars fund military programs like Predator drone missions that again have killed numerous civilians. That repulses me. But no one is going to defund those programs on my behalf. Nor do I hear any of these so-called “pro-lifers” protesting against the wars we wage, the weapons we use that contain depleted uranium, the executions we carry out in this country, the money we give to militaries and governments that is used to kill and maim and torture people, the cluster munitions and landmines we have strewn across the world that kill, maim, and injure people everyday…How the hell can anyone call themselves “pro-life” and support so many government-sponsored deaths?
As for your claim that “this is not a war on women’s rights”…A war on abortion is absolutely a war on women’s rights–their rights to do what they want with their own bodies. Their rights to make informed medical decisions in conjunction with their doctors when it comes to pregnancy and reproductive health issues. Their rights to have their medical decisions kept private and to have the government kept OUT of the doctor’s office. Their rights to access reproductive health services, especially for low income women. Their rights to have a voice and a choice. There is a very clear correlation between women’s overall rights and equality in a society and their level of reproductive rights. Countless studies have been conducted to show that connection. So while you may disagree with abortion and you may have no intentions of seeking such services, abortion is still a legal and constitutionally protected right in this country. And waging a war against Planned Parenthood is absolutely a war against women’s rights.
Well, after reading your post, I have to admit I’m feeling some love for you as well!  Thanks for your well thought out and factual argument in support of Planned Parenthood!
What an idiot you have shown yourself to be…It is “Unprofessional and Bitchy” to say planned parenthood is “abortion happy”.  Is it unprofessional to say a car dealer is “car happy” because they sold 300,000 cars last year or that McDonalds is “hamburger happy” because they sold a quarter of a million Big Macs last year? If you perform 300,000 abortions in a year then you are most certainly “Abortion Happy”   Only a fool uses Planned Parenthoods report of “SERVICES” provided to make their case that they are not primarily an Abortion institute.   Yes, they may only show 3% of their “services” going toward abortions but it’s all in the way you spin it.   A service is a phone consult or an office visit for a kid with an STD or an abortion.  If a branch takes 60 phone calls in a day and has 37 office visits to get some kids hooked up with condoms or birth control pills and then performs 3 abortions your numbers are born.  97% of the days “services”, are non-abortion related.  Seems innocent enough, lets send $400 million in tax dollars to them!!!  Wow, they hardly do any abortion right???  Wrong!  I for one prefer to have our tax dollars spread out to organizations whose primary focus is NOT abortions.  Say what you want but the organization was founded to perform abortions and performs more abortions annually than any other organization in our country. This being said I am totally Pro Choice but pay for your own damn abortion and let my same tax dollars go to organizations whose primary focus is helping women in other ways.  This is not about a  war on rights or abortions at all, just a push to move money to an organzation who’s focus is womens health.  Re-read the article before you send off some crazy and foolish comments because you are concerned your job at PP is about to be marginalized.  xoxo
Jack, I feel sorry for you…so much anger and hatred and illogical reasoning in one short post…
Yes, PP provided about 330,000 abortions in 2009. But that is still only 3% of their direct medical services (and no “medical services” does not include phone calls as you so baselessly asserted). Lets have a look at some of the other services they provided, using actual numbers and data rather than abstract, baseless theorizing…
Each year, *3 million* women AND men received a total of *11.4 million* medical services while also preventing more than 610,000 unintended pregnancies, which as mentioned previously means they PREVENTED more than 250,000 abortions (for an organization that you claim is so “abortion happy,” they certainly prevent a lot of abortions every year).
Want a more specific breakdown of “medical services” provided? Here you go:
–35% of services are for contraception. They provided more than *4 million* contraception services, including about 144,000 men, *1.53 million* emergency contraceptive kits, and *2.32 million* women for reversible birth control methods (primarily oral contraceptives, but also includes condoms, IUDs, hormone rings, patches, etc.)
–35% of services are for STD/STI testing and treatment. This includes about 540,000 HIV tests for both men and women and another *3.42 million* STD procedures (testing and treatment).
–16% of services are for cancer screenings and prevention. Which translates into *900,000* PAP smears every year; *45,000* HPV vaccinations; over *830,000* breast exams/care; over *46,000* colposcopy exams; *2,700* LEEP/LOOP procedures (which involves removing damaged or abnormal cells on the cervix to prevent cervical cancer); and *2,000* cryotherapy procedures.
–10% of services are other women’s health services, including *1.15 million* pregnancy tests and nearly 20,000 prenatal and/or midlife clients.
–Other services make up the remaining 1% of services, including nearly 20,000 primary care clients (male and female), nearly 1,000 adoption referrals to other agencies, and over 56,000 other services including WIC services, pediatric care, and immunizations.
But you’re right, that 3% definitely makes them “abortion-happy.” Forget about the fact that they provide **11.1 million** OTHER medical services every year, including preventing abortions. It would be silly to say they are “STD-testing-and-preventing-happy” (what a mouthful) or “pregnancy-happy” or “cancer-screening happy” or “education-happy” or “birth control happy.” Because none of those titles are nearly as exciting or inflammatory.
In addition to medical services, Planned Parenthood has several other areas of activities, including education and information.
Each year, Planned Parenthood provides sexuality education courses to *1.2 million* people of all ages. These education programs focus on HIV/AIDS, contraception/family planning (including abstinence), family life education, parent-child communication, puberty education, safer sex, sexual orientation/homophobia, sexuality education, sexually transmitted infections, teenage pregnancy, and women’s health.
And each year, the PP website receives about 22 million visits to their website, primarily for information resources.
Planned Parenthood is the most popular and most respected health services provider in the country. Yes, they performed “more abortions than any other organization” simply because they have the capacity to do so–but they only performed about 30% of the abortions in the entire country. So the vast majority of abortions in this country are NOT provided by Planned Parenthood.
Women already pay for “their own damn abortions.” Federal funding cannot be and is not used to fund abortion services. Period. Planned Parenthood helps millions of men and women every year. 75% of their clients have incomes more than 150% BELOW the poverty line. Finding an alternative health provider, particularly one that can be trusted to provide quality, reliable, affordable care, is not something that should be treated so flippantly.
Please don’t waste your energy feeling sorry for me, I should survive.  I harbor zero hatred for anybody but I do love how people like you try to twist other peoples words to fit your own narrow minded thinking and agenda.  I suspect anyone who disaggrees with you is illogical and “bitchy”.  Typical passive aggressive behavioral traits that we see displayed with the disinfranchised.  No one said planned parenthood is not a fine organization with fantastic benefits to women.  They will continue to do wonderful things and help those in need of help but they should do it without government funding.  Let’s give that funding to other organizations and see if they can help women more than PP with that money. Worth a try no??    There are many that disagree with having their tax dollars go to an organzation who defaults to abortion with such ease.  Although I’ve got no issues with PP I do have issues with our tax dollars feeding this process.  What are you so angry about, the money will still go to help women and families, just at different locations and hopefully better ways?   And please stop with the cut and paste posts.  That’s not the purpose of a blog.  Try doing some independent thinking instead, it might open your narrow mind up a bit………
P.S.  Does I stand with PP mean you are a male?  :)
No, it’s not “worth a try.” Planned Parenthood has the resources, expertise, research, standards, experience, and recognition that makes them worthy of their title as an indispensable organization and service provider. The Pence amendment prevents any organization that offers abortion services from receiving Title X funding. Bush established the same policy with PEPFAR funding under the Mexico City policy–some of the leading organizations in developing countries that provided HIV testing and treatment lost funding because they also happened to provide birth control and abortion services. They took funding away from some of the most capable, most experienced, most reliable, and most effective programs in the fight against HIV/AIDS because Bush decided he didn’t want women in developing countries to have access to safe and legal abortions.
There is no rule in Title X that says other organizations can’t get funding. Other organizations can and do receive funding under Title X, but just like every other federal funding program, organizations have to compete. Planned Parenthood has clearly been chosen repeatedly as the preeminent provider for reproductive health care. Because they are good at what they do and they do it responsibly and cost-effectively.
The Pence Amendment is just one of the many ways current GOP leaders in the House are trying to attack women’s reproductive rights. Taken in conjunction with the other bills and amendments they have proposed, this is far more than an issue of “re-allocating funds.” It is an attack on women’s rights. Just listen to the debate that went on in the House–listen to the rhetoric the GOP leaders used. Their intent is absolutely to limit access to reproductive health services, and especially abortion.
Planned Parenthood does not “default to abortion.” It is incredibly easy (and pitiful) to choose such arguments without providing any basis, any facts, or any proof. But you are good at that, as we have seen so far. If you can provide solid evidence for any of the things you claim, I would love to see it.
As for your assertion, I am not “cutting and pasting.” I am using concrete evidence and data (which I realize is a foreign concept to you) to back up everything I am saying. You should try it sometime. It might open up your narrow mind a bit…or at the very least make you sound a little less ignorant.
You win PP.  can’t compete with the queen of cut and paste.  I change my stange and prefer we up our tax contribution to a cool half billion for you and PP.  There is NO other options available and thus we must continue down this path.  But lets be real.  It doesn’t have a chance of passing anyway so we are all good.  PP, enjoy your weekend!!  Crack a bottle of wine and hit a rock and and go enjoy some unprotected sex!  You need to just relax and not take yourself so serious girl
Please, oh great one, show me where I am “cutting and pasting” from. Providing solid data and hard facts is how you make and support logical arguments in the real world. Meanwhile, you have failed to provide a single piece of data or evidence. The fact that you have to rely so heavily on jokes, personal attacks, flippant remarks just shows how weak and baseless your arguments really are. But I am sure you know that.
You are right, though. There is no way in hell this amendment is going to pass the Senate. Thank God we still have sensible leaders in one segment of Congress.
“Crack a bottle of wine and hit a rock and and go enjoy some unprotected sex!”
Cute. And very mature.
What so many of those commenting below fail to realize is that their choice to have their choice supported by government funding is not my choice as a taxpayer.  Abortion is a choice, as many here have said. It is legal.  That does NOT, however, make it okay for tax dollars to go to a clinic that provides this OPTIONAL procedure. Other clinics can provide health care just as well.
When others to provide for our choices we run the risk of giving up our rights to those providing for our desires.
I prefer to be responsible for the freedom to make my own own choices.  I cannot afford insurance, so I make arrangements with my medical providers to pay them as I am able.  I cannot afford college education, but I encourage my high school age child to seek scholarships and work toward his educational goals.  This is old fashioned American thinking, but if I choose to live a certain way it is my responsiblity to provide for that lifestyle, not expect a taxpayer I’ve never met to provide for my desires.  To many people forget that rights and responsiblities go hand-in-hand; when we hand over the responsibilities to our government, we give up many of the rights our forbears fought so hard to win for us.  Asking the government to fund our choices can easily  result in those choices being regulated by the government, thereby taking away the very rights so many here vehemently say they support.
Currently no federal funding is used to provide abortions, at Planned Parenthood or anywhere else.  The funding that is being eliminated from Planned Parenthood is funding used for preventative healthcare and STD testing, and is being eliminated as a punishment for Planned Parenthood’s practice of providing abortions for their patients through the use of private donations and payment by patients. Again, this in no way funded by states or the federal government.  Funding or not funding abortions isn’t even a real issue. It is already settled that the federal government will not provide any funding for abortion services.  
As far as the responsibility of taxpayers to pay for the desires of other people, I would just remind you that there are a lot things that taxpayers for, pay and may not necessarily desire, to take care of other people.  I have no children, but your desire, and other people’s similiar desire, to have children has effected my taxes as my taxes are used to educate children of people I have never and will never meet.  I have no desire to participate in wars, but my taxes are still used to fund them.  I did not vote for every president, vice president, representative, or governor who has ever been elected to “represent” me, but my taxes are used to fund their salaries, even when I think they are doing a poor job.  I have no desire to contribute a portion of my paycheck to social security (which isn’t really a tax, but is withdrawn from my paycheck by the federal government), knowing full well that there will be no funds paid back to me when I reach retirement age, but that money is still taken from every single one of my paychecks and paid out to others.
What I do desire is fewer unintended pregnancies through information and access to birth control, the slowed spread of STD’s and STI’s, and healthcare screening for things like cervical and breast cancer.  Planned Parenthood provides all of these things at a reasonable cost to women and men who can’t afford other doctor’s offices and otherwise would go without these necessary health services.  While there are other places, I am sure, that provide similiar services, there are none that I know of in the area where I live, or in many other areas.  And I don’t think we should put the health of so many people who depend on the services provided by Planned Parenthood, that are completely unrelated to abortion, at risk to send a political message.
Ah, the rape argument. Abortion-lovers always pull that one out of the hat. The truth is, if the only babies ever aborted were those that were the product of rape, there wouldn’t be a national outcry about abortion (I’m not saying no one would object – I’m saying the scale of the conflict would be massively reduced). But the fact is, millions of babies have been killed out of convenience. That is messed up. What’s more, Rachel, that 1-in-3 will be raped statistic has been widely debunked. Get your facts straight.
Diane,
I would be ecstatic if the 1 in 3 women rape statistic were “widely debunked.”  Please direct me to a credible source so I can see that it is, in fact, untrue.  
As for the “rape argument,” you are correct, many pro-choice advocates point to this argument as one way to support the continued legality of a woman’s right to choose.  However, no one is claiming that those are the only abortions that happen.  I was merely pointing out the fact that not all abortions are the product of “premeditated or idiotic action” on the part of women who have abortions.  But, there are clearly many more reasons for abortion than simply rape, including health of the mother, “babies” who would be born with significant birth defects like a lack of a brain or other vital organ, financial inability to care for a child, the choice to continue to focus on education or career growth, or simply the fact that the woman who chooses to have an abortion never wanted to have children.  And in our legal system, all of these women have a legal right to make the choice to have an abortion, no matter what their reasoning.
As for facts, I would point you to the fact that during the time in which abortion was illegal in the United States, women still had them.  However, they were performed in unsafe conditions which lead to the death of many women.  Like it or not, women are going to continue having abortions, and I for one would like to make sure they do it with a licensed doctor in a medically safe environment.  Of course, I would prefer that unwanted pregnancies never happened, making the abortion debate moot, but without accurate information about birth control (which our schools don’t provide thanks to federal funding for abstinence only education) and without affordable access to birth control methods for all men and women in this country, unwanted pregnancies aren’t going anywhere.
hmmm, my college education should have taught me to proof read.  Poli-Sci…also known as political science…not “policy science.”
Planned Parenthood is Blood-Thirsty. They lie & deceive for the purpose of murdering little kids who looked just like you & I when we were their age. These kids experience the pain of being torn to shreds or aborted by saline injections. Why the hell should you or I pay for this ugly practice? Because making money by killing little kids is a “Hard Sell” to the public, so they enlist government help, mostly Atheists & Democrats, to further their practice. Wake Up! It’s not that hard to figure out. Planned Parenthood cannot be trusted. Even their name is a lie…they give NO credit to our Maker for making us…it’s “all” up to OUR planning. We need to abort this from all our budgets … State & National. It is a dangerous weed that will suck the life out of all of us. Not convinced? Watch a movie of an actual abortion taking place…e.g. Silent Scream. See what actually takes place in these procedures. The ruthless OBJECTIFICATION of women  has a price.
Dood, do you support funding the military? Just asking…
Planned Parenthood is a for profit corporation disguising itself as a charity. Every dollar sent to PP is two dollars in new debt to taxpayers. Presently, monthly federal overspending our tax receipts is more than the entire annual budget of California – the largest state. We need to cut back now – PP is just one of many extras that needs to start standing on its own.
Wow. That is so incorrect. And the lack of factual references tell me that you either 1. Don’t really care or 2. Are trying to get a reaction. So here is mine. Abortion is a women’s issue, because getting a woman pregnant is the easiest way to control her. And 1 in four women who have reported being in an abusive relationship have also reported that their partners have sabotaged their birth control in some way. What about those women?
You’re defending the wrong side. And what’s worse, if it were up to the Mike Pences of the world, you wouldn’t be a young college student. You’d be a young mother of three. And that’s all you’d ever be. You and Lila Rose can thank the women’s movement for that, whether you’d like it or not.
You are welcome to your opinion as am I.
     I will try to be as pleasant as possible here when the fact of the matter is I think you need to grow up and open your eyes to the world around you. Frankly, I find this article appalling. I guess you’ve never had a boyfriend cheat on you and didn’t want to or couldn’t go to a gp to get STD testing. Or maybe you found a lump. Or maybe you just want to get a pap smear, you know as preventative care to make sure you are healthy.  Planned Parenthood is not just abortions. People prefer to go to a place they know or know of and are comfortable with in general.
You say a lot of people aren’t too happy about it. No I’m flipping ticked off (that was my polite way of phrasing that).
In case you are not aware: Abortion is a woman’s right. It may not be all of women’s rights but it is one of them.
   Abortion is legal. Therefore, this is attacking a place just because it provides them. It doesn’t matter whether you or anyone else agrees with abortions, they are legal. Planned Parenthood follows the law with regards to funding and that’s what you need to worry about.
    It is my right, as a woman, to go to Planned Parenthood if I see fit. By trying to get rid of Planned Parenthood he is trampling my rights and the rights of any other woman who wishes to receive services. There is no other point of this than to attack a woman’s choice to have an abortion. 
“To claim the Pence Amendment would harm women and families in need and take away choices is illogical. If anything, it would help women.”
No, it would make them have to find somewhere else to go that they may not be comfortable with. If a woman wants to go somewhere else she will. No one forces her to go to Planned Parenthood, but they are trying to take that choice from her.
“Women’s rights are not under attack here. Passage of the bill into law would arguably empower women by giving them more choices beyond abortion-happy Planned Parenthood.”
P.P. is a choice and you are arguing to take it away. Shame. I went to P.P. when I was pregnant and I can attest to the fact that they are not abortion-happy as you so blithely phrased it. All my options were laid on the table.
  Have you ever actually gone to Planned Parenthood because from the tone of your article I highly doubt it. If you wish to continue in your Poli Sci career I’d suggest you do actual physical research on both sides of any argument you wish to converse on. By physical research I mean get away from the internet and any books or articles you might have read and march yourself down to whatever facility/institution you are discussing and actually talk to people. Here’s a hint: The P.P. I visited, of my own free will and choice, actually had a notebook in the lobby for people to write their experiences for others to read and perhaps give them some insight. I hope you are getting up to go do that now. Otherwise you are giving a very one-sided argument and I’m sure your profs would tell you that can be very, um, ignorant.
I stand for Planned Parenthood.
Well, with your obvious opinion here I guess you will now never have to worry about a friend or loved one coming to you with an unexpected pregnancy scare. They already will know how you feel. So that’s a bonus for you since you won’t have to deal with it. But from their perspective you will be one less person they can count on because you want to take away somewhere they may want to go and discuss their options. With the support system small already people need P.P. more than ever. It’s safe, confidential, and non-judgmental. When you have no one else to talk to that is very important.
Best of luck.
I don’t really see how a “pregnancy scare” is possible without some sort of premeditated or idiotic action underlying it. In any case, don’t real doctors exist to take care of people who need to go to them? Go to one of them—I don’t want my tax dollars funding your decadent lifestyle.
@Anonymous – 
Pregnancy scares are actually quite possible without some sort of premeditated or idiotic action, as you phrase it.  There are many young women in this world who, for one reason or another, choose to not be on birth control.  And just to head off your argument that this woman is “idiotic,” lets talk only about those women who are saving themselves for marriage or are religious, and either feel that they don’t need birth control, or are told by their church that the use of birth control is a sin.  Or how about those adolescent girls who have not yet made the decision to get on birth control.
Now lets say that one of these women gets raped.  As 1 in 3 women in the United States will be raped at some point in here life, it is actually more likely that many of these women will get raped.  By a friend, a boyfriend, a relative, or a stranger, she will be forced to have a sexual encounter that she neither premeditated nor wanted.  And some of these rapes result in a pregnancy.  What a woman in this situation chooses to do is just that – her choice.  I don’t know about you, but I have been raped.  If that rape resulted in a pregnancy you bet your ass I would have had an abortion.  I was held down, my clothes removed, and my body violated.  If you think that I am going to also carry this man’s child for nine months, you are flat out wrong.  And that would have been my choice.
Not to mention the fact that your argument is just a fallacy – that pregnancies can be prevented if you do everything right.  Maybe your school didn’t teach sex ed, or maybe you just weren’t paying attention, but there is no such thing as a birth control option that is 100% effective against pregnancy, except abstinance.  If you want to live your life saving yourself for “the one,” be my guest, but you don’t get to make that choice for others.  So, many women do everything right, use one or multiple forms of birth control (like the pill and a condom) and still get pregnant.
Now, about your suggestion that you don’t want you tax dollars funding other individual’s “decadent” lifestyles.  Too bad.  Seriously.  Once you pay your taxes, you are no longer in control of how that money is used.  I don’t want my taxes going to fund wars, paying George W. Bush’s pension, paying the salaries of elected officials who try to strip me of my fundamental rights as a woman, etc.  I bet if every american looked at the actual budget of the United States, we would all find multiple things we, as citizens, pay for that pisses us off.  But you will also find that a large portion of your taxes go to things that you do approve of, and none of your taxes go to abortion.
If you don’t like Planned Parenthood, don’t go there.  If you don’t approve of abortions, don’t get one.  But keep your ideology off my body, I have rights too.
Rachel, I think I love you. :)
Lol, well thank you!
I don’t really see how a “pregnancy scare” is possible without some sort of premeditated or idiotic action underlying it.
***********************************
You can be responsible and take birth-control and/or using condoms. None of these methods is 100% effective.
This is a joke, right?

Once upon a time, Charlie Sheen was not a Internet meme, but an actual real live actor with a promising career.
Call us nostalgic, but here’s a list of our favorite Sheen films that will make you yearn for the days of his winning roles, not “bi-winning.”
Ferris Bueller’s Day off (1986)
Yep, read it again – the Sheenster was in the classic John Hughes about a mischievious truant high school student who brings his best friend and girlfriend into his day of hijinks. It’s a small part, but Sheen manages to be memorable as “Boy in Police Station.”
Wall Street (1987)
If you haven’t seen this iconic ‘80s film that preaches that “Greed is good,” get on it. Sheen plays the impressionable Bud to Michael Douglas’s delightfully heartless Gordon Gekko.
His performance balances ingenuity and ambition and still grips viewers despite its dated touches. Airline stock – profitable? Scoff if you will, but the movie’s message of the dangers of greed – and Sheen’s gripping acting – passes the test of time.
Young Guns (1988)
This movie’s poster simply read: “SIX REASONS WHY THE WEST WAS WILD” and listed the eight actors that studded middle budget 1980s movies: Emilio Estevez, Keifer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Dermot Mulroney, Casey Siemaszko and, of course, Charlie Sheen.
Combine prime 1980s man meat and the wild west, and you’ve got a very comic guilty pleasure film.
The Rookie (1990)
Sheen flexed his action muscles in this Clint Eastwood cheesefest which told the story of a veteran cop (a grimy Eastwood), his green partner (a nearly two-dimensional Sheen) and their chase to pin a bad guy. It’s a bad movie, sure, but the stuff of perfect mid-afternoon television.

On President’s Day weekend the USC Chess team took the Trojans to a perfect victory at the U.S. Amateur Team West Championships.
The tournament was held at the Warner Marriot and hosted teams from all over the country, including pre-tourney favorite Hot Tub Timoshenko from Arizona, who began with a 5-0 record.
USC dispatched all takers, including Hot Tub Timoshenko in the final round, and out of 24 games lost only once.
Although the chess team doesn’t garner as much attention as the baseball team, students on campus were quick to congratulate the champions.
“It’s great that they won,” said Halle Arbaugh, a freshman majoring in English, “I can’t play chess, but I’m proud that our teams seem to win every time they compete, in whatever they play.”
The USC team was led by local star and International Master Jack Peters, consisted of Danyul Lawrence, Blake Phillips, Nathan Heussenstamm. Sriram Balasubramanian was an alternate.
Way to go, USC!

In 1999, a four-piece all female band named Raining Jane was formed at UCLA. In 2003, they decided that they were going to start touring.
Raining Jane played over 120 shows a year for over six years. The band didn’t go unrewarded; the unusual start to this indie-rock group was what helped them take off. In their six-year stint, they opened for UCLA alumnus Sara Bareilles and wrote the song “A Beautiful Mess” with Jason Mraz.
Amid their touring craze, they found time to release three independent albums. Their songs then found their way onto television shows like Grey’s Anatomy and So You Think You Can Dance.
 
The eclectic quartet, comprised of a cellist, a guitarist, a bassist and a percussionist, all vocally contribute to the band. Their most recent album, Paper Nest, released in 2008, truly demonstrates their flexibility as artists by providing the listener with a unique musical experience.
From quirky upbeat tunes to mellow ballads, Raining Jane covers a huge range of emotions in their songs.
My Top Picks: “Prelude,” “Broken Parts,” “Clementine” and “Castles and Factories.”
