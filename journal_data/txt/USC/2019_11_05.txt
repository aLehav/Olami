College tuition costs get talked about frequently. But low-income students have another concern that’s not always visible, but that’s a more immediate threat — paying for a place to live. Now, business administration student Esther Cha and public policy student Abigail Leung are opening Trojan Shelter, a homeless shelter for students, by students. Music by Joakim Karud.

Video games have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. Through the years, they’ve continued to captivate me. Pokémon as a child, Super Smash Bros. as an adolescent and now, as an adult, Overwatch.
In that time, I have come to learn you can loosely categorize gamers into three categories: story-seekers, achievement-unlockers and competitors. I fall into the final category. I saw video games as an area where I could dedicate my time and effort to be the best I could be. I appreciate the grind, hard effort and dedication it takes to be the best at something. 
With that being said, I often tried to distance myself from the group of gamers who I prejudicially classified as the “weird gamers.” 
“No, I’m not that type of gamer,” I would say to people who were surprised at how invested I was in video games as a 21-year-old.
This past weekend, fans from 59 countries all descended on the Anaheim Convention Center for BlizzCon 2019, a video game convention for Blizzard games. I was fortunate enough to attend, but I had some reservations going in. I initially thought BlizzCon was just a gathering for the lore-obsessed cosplay gamers, and I would be the outcast dressed in street clothes looking for my next victory. 
I was wrong.
This column, so far, has been dedicated to comparing esports to traditional sports because that is what I am familiar with. The competitive side of video games was my sole priority when I started playing. I genuinely did not understand why someone would want to play a video game if they didn’t want to compete.
But the reality is that video games are so much bigger than esports. This is an entire community — a welcoming, diverse community that shares a love for video games. Before BlizzCon, I had only experienced a sliver of that community. 
At 7 a.m. on the first day, two hours before the convention center opened, thousands of fans filled the lobby and overflowed out the doors. I was overwhelmed by the sheer mass and diversity of the crowd. While still predominantly male, there were many more women than I expected. Kids as young as 5 years old ran through the crowds accompanied by their parents.
When 9 a.m. rolled around, the doors opened and a stampede of fans rushed the stage floor in hopes of getting a seat to watch the opening ceremony and the release of all the new content.
With each new game’s introduction, I felt chills down my spine. I have played just one of Blizzard’s six main titles, and even though I didn’t understand most of what was being said, I couldn’t help but smile when the crowd erupted with cheers for each announcement.
The fan experience at BlizzCon was unlike anything I have ever been a part of. It’s hard to make a direct comparison because it is truly unique. Blizzard had thousands of computers set up in rows for fans to test unreleased games, hosted panels with game designers and even held a five-hour-long costume/cosplay contest.
I walked around the stage floor for 12 hours the first day and never once felt tired or bored. Blizzard has perfected its fan experience. I wasn’t an outcast — most people weren’t dressed in cosplay, and there were plenty of gamers who were primarily interested in the competitive aspect of the game. Those interested in the competitive side looped the players versus players line, competing in the new, unreleased 6v6 tug-of-war-style game.
With the advent of the internet, we have lost the camaraderie aspect of video games. There is something special about playing video games with the people sitting next to you. It’s cool seeing the person next to you fist pump after a big play or hear an opponent shout an expletive after you land a nice shot.
I left BlizzCon with a new perspective on the gaming community. The three categories of gamers can live harmoniously. The gaming community shouldn’t have stigmas directed toward any one type of gamer.
The video gaming community is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. The subcommunities don’t try to distance themselves from each other; instead, they support each other. 
While I would never dress up in cosplay, I now admire those who have spent months, or even years, meticulously crafting the outfit and gear of their favorite character. I respect the people who attend each year to meet up with friends and trade patches and pins with complete strangers.
Blizzard president J. Allen Brack put it best in his opening ceremony speech. 
“When we get it right, we create a common ground where the community comes together to compete, connect and play irrespective of the things that divide us,” he said.
I’ve always known that I love video games, but BlizzCon helped me realize that I love the gaming community even more than the games themselves.

Whistles blew, speakers blared and football coaches yelled and screamed as usual at Howard Jones Field Tuesday. Despite the disappointment that was USC’s 32-point loss to No. 7 Oregon Ducks Saturday, much remains the same at the Trojans’ football practice.
However, given the current state of USC football, change may be exactly what the Trojans need. After USC’s loss to the Ducks, its record now stands at 5-4 overall and 4-2 in the Pac-12. 
As its chances for a Pac-12 Championship dwindle and calls for head coach Clay Helton’s firing grow louder, the team admits there is an added element of motivation this week as it prepares to play conference-foe Arizona State on the road this weekend. 
Bouncing Back
Freshman running back Kenan Christon, who ran the ball 15 times for 79 yards against Oregon, said the team is more focused on making a comeback rather than dwelling on the loss. 
“It just gives us a kick-start,” Christon said after practice. “We come out of the weekend, [and] we may be down after that game, but we know we got to get back to work on Monday. We don’t like that feeling so we’ve just got to get right back to it and make sure it doesn’t happen again … I think it gives us players a little more drive and a little more attitude.”
Redshirt sophomore offensive tackle Jalen McKenzie echoed Christon’s sentiment.
“Honestly, it’s like a 24-hour rule,” McKenzie said. “[We] deal with the loss, correct everything we saw that we were doing wrong on film and then we get right back to the grind the day after. The day after [the game], we got started on ASU.” 
Unlike some of his teammates, freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis maintained that even after the loss, the team’s general mindset is more or less the same as it was prior to the Oregon game. 
“I think we’re pretty motivated regardless of what happened in the past week,” Slovis said at practice. “If it’s a win, you’re more motivated to win the next week because you know you’ve got a chance to win the South. If you lose, you’re just that much more motivated to stay in it. So I think it’s the same regardless.” 
Handling the Noise
After Tuesday’s practice, President Carol Folt and Chairman of the Board of Trustees Rick Caruso were seen speaking with Helton. 
The image underscored all the headlines and rumors surrounding USC’s football program in the wake of last weekend’s blowout loss at the Coliseum. Unrest from Trojan fans with Helton’s performance seems to have reached an all-time high and rampant speculation as to his future replacement has begun en masse. 
In the face of all this criticism, Helton chose not to dwell on the controversy surrounding his job and instead highlighted the support he’s received from Folt and Caruso.
“[Folt’s] support and Mr. Caruso’s support has always been there, and I’m appreciative [of it],” Helton said. “That’s one of the great things about being part of the Trojan Family. Obviously this is a production-based business and you want wins, but those people have always been great to me … To see them out here today supporting this team and this staff meant a lot to me.” 
In addition to recognizing Folt and Caruso’s support, Helton also emphasized the importance of keeping his team’s attention on the field rather than the headlines. 
“We do a great job of outside noise staying outside,” Helton said. “This is our family right here, so let’s focus on us. Let’s focus on nothing that’s outside but us — right here, right now in this moment for three weeks because these three weeks dictate our season. We’ve always trained ourselves not to worry about the outside noise or what’s going on.” 
Injury Report
Junior running back Stephen Carr ran Tuesday but did not practice. According to Helton, Carr says he is currently about 90% and will probably return next week if not this week. 
Freshman defensive lineman Drake Jackson was back at practice after suffering a sprained ankle two weeks ago against Arizona. He will continue to be evaluated. 
Sophomore safety Talanoa Hufanga cannot be put in contact situations yet but is progressing, according to Helton.

Located within walking distance of campus, the newly-opened Factory Tea Bar on Figueroa Street attracted a long line of students eager to get free boba tea drinks and  try the limited-time menu that ranged from around $5 to $10. 
Last Friday, around 80 students visited the newly established a chain restaurant, which serves Asian tea drinks and finger foods. The shop, first established in San Gabriel Valley in 2011, offered free boba drinks to the first 100 customers and an Apple Watch to a random customer as a promotional event. 
“Just from first impression … this location gives off a very different vibe than the San Gabriel one,” said Hanna Siregar, a sophomore majoring in health and human sciences. “Coming from the 626, we already have a lot of good boba there. Having a taste of a boba shop that we’re already familiar with from our hometown is a lot better to have as opposed to settling for Pot of Cha.” 
Throughout the weekend, the shop offered more promotions including “buy one, get one free” drinks and a $25 gift card. 
“[I came to the grand opening] because I want free boba — just to get an understanding of their price range and the quality of boba,” said Celanie Peng, a freshman majoring in world business administration.  I don’t have boba often, but if I like it, I’ll probably come again.”
Project manager Jolie Pham said employees from the San Gabriel location also came to the new location Friday to help with the grand opening. 
“We tried to open as soon as we can, [as soon as] we got the permit, but … it would be a rush for us,” said Pham, who added that the grand opening was pushed by a week. “People support Factory Tea Bar so much … so I would say it’s a lot easier than [opening] the Factory Tea Bar in San Gabriel … since people know about us.” 
Ryan Lee, a sophomore majoring in business and real estate finance who has visited the bar’s San Gabriel location, expressed excitement in having a Factory Tea Bar so close to school.
“We’ve actually been to the Factory Tea Bar in San Gabriel and that’s how we heard about this,” Lee said. “It’s one of our favorite places and has brought us a lot of memories … The San Gabriel location had really great vibes, there were couches everywhere, TVs, you’d be able to rent out board games using your ID. It was just a hangout place for friends.” 
As one of the many boba shops near USC, Factory Tea Bar hopes to stand out with its freshly cooked boba and a variety of food choices. Pham said the menu was curated to appeal to the local demographics. 
“The strong weapon [that] we can apply in this area is our special-cooked boba … We want to make sure the boba is consistently fresh and warm in each [cup of the] drink,” Pham said. “There’s a lot of USC students, which is a lot of Asian Americans and international students from everywhere around the world. Also, we have a local [area] that has a lot of Mexicans, so we want to look for in the menu the El Chamango and the elote fries.” 
To target USC students, Factory Tea Bar offers discounts for large group orders for fundraiser events and commissioned a Tommy Trojan mural on one of its walls. 
“I was so happy and excited that people came and got in line, and we were busy all day. So this was successful,” Pham said. “I’m hoping Factory Tea Bar will be one of the best boba joints in this area, so people can come hang out and study here.”

The first food I ever learned how to cook was scrambled eggs. Standing over the kitchen stove on a chair, looking over my dad’s shoulders as he poured eggs, milk and cheese into a pan, stirring as they cooked. 
Some days, I would watch as he made shapes out of store-bought pancake mix, making my own Pollockian masterpieces for breakfast. It is a simple, bright memory, one that I’m sure I share with many children raised in the U.S., and one that kick-started my eventual all-consuming passion for food.
My love for cooking lay dormant throughout most of middle school — as I transitioned from a kid who ate too much to a teen who ate too little, food was never a priority for me. Meals came in brown bags or on a plastic tray or served on the blue floral china set we kept for too many years at my house. 
But, as I explored the gustatory world outside of my small, white neighborhood in high school, I began to grow obsessed with food — eating it, learning about it, making it, all of it. I watched Anthony Bourdain until I fell asleep. I read Eater and Thrillist and Bon Appétit every day, scrolling through pages and pages in between classes. On dull weekends or days at the mall, I would spend hours in the cookbook section of Barnes & Noble, reading recipes and stories of chefs and bakers. 
By the time I entered college, I was determined to score a restaurant job where I could get closer to the industry I so desperately wanted to be a part of. And, after the bulk of my courses were complete, I found a job working the front of house at a restaurant.
For a while, it was everything I had hoped for — I memorized the menu, served food, talked to customers, even got to prepare a couple of dishes. But over time, I was slowly exposed to a rotten side of the restaurant industry I had skimmed over in all my reading. 
When a cook first started calling me inappropriate nicknames, I ignored him. I figured this was sort of the standard, and I didn’t really mind. I had been called worse things. And none of my managers seemed to be bothered by it. When his hands grazed my back, I brushed it off — a mistake, a miscalculation on my part. Just a friendly touch. 
For seven months, I ignored the way he treated me. 
It was only when I discovered another coworker had been changing the background of our company computers to images of me that I finally got angry. I felt violated. I felt like I was the butt of a joke I was not a part of. My formal complaint felt like an enraged shout into the void, something that was never reflected on, another angry woman.
A month later, that coworker got a raise.
It took me months to work up the courage to quit. I endured it all — questions about my sexuality, compliments on my body type, jokes at my expense as a woman — for some reason, I had justified it with the idea that this was commonplace for the industry.
And, unfortunately, I was right. 
The restaurant world is still a dark, treacherous territory to navigate when it comes to workplace sexism. Most restaurants don’t have an established human resources department, and if they do, they are mostly committed to ensuring complaints — and lawsuits — never see the light of day. Back-of-house dynamics can sometimes feel like a fraternity, and in a male-dominated environment, women are expected not to complain about sexist or offensive behaviors. 
Restaurants seem to be at the tail end of a sweeping feminist movement, but there has been some progress. Sexual harassment accusations are being taken seriously — even big-name chefs such as Mario Batali, Mike Isabella and John Besh have faced public consequences as a result of their direct actions or cultivated environments. In 2017, the pilot season of “The Great American Baking Show,” a spin-off of “The Great British Baking Show,” was completely pulled from the air after judge Johnny Iuzzini faced sexual misconduct claims. 
Additionally, more and more female chefs are opening restaurants, helping to eliminate the male-dominated atmosphere of the culinary world. Ideally, these female-led environments alleviate some of the toxicity present in stereotypical restaurant dynamics. 
I love food, but I hated my job in the food industry. Some days I dreaded working with some of my coworkers, ones who had previously made me uncomfortable. Some days I felt helpless. 
Looking back on it now, I realize that a younger me would be incredibly disappointed in my pacificity. Present-day me is disappointed in it too. All the passion, all the information, all the skill I had with food was wasted because I was too afraid to be upset, to be angry, to complain and be heard. 
I’m never going to stop loving food. I’m never going to stop being an active member in the food industry. But now, I’m going to start respecting myself.

About 90 minutes before he was set to graduate from Boston College, 22-year-old Alexander Urtula jumped from the top of a parking structure and died. His then-girlfriend, Inyoung You, has been charged with involuntary 
manslaughter for his suicide. 
According to Rachael Rollins, the Suffolk County district attorney who announced the charge last week, You had been physically and emotionally abusive to Urtula over the course of their 18-month relationship, repeatedly telling him that everyone would be better off without him and urging him to “go die.” In cases of domestic abuse, especially one as severe as this one, people may wonder why the victim didn’t just leave. 
While the answer involves a combination of social and emotional factors, there are also powerful neurological factors at play that can make the victim feel like it’s impossible to leave the relationship.
Research has found that domestic abuse alters brain chemistry in a way that makes it difficult for the victim to leave. According to a study conducted by UCLA psychology professor Shelley Taylor, one major neurochemical responsible for this feeling is oxytocin. 
Normally, oxytocin released from the amygdala promotes positive social bonds and has a calming effect, but under distressing conditions such as domestic violence, it’s released from receptors in the lateral septum to trigger a social stress response. This response is associated with physical feelings of pain and withdrawal, along with a desire to return to happier times in the relationship. Neurochemicals like oxytocin are powerful in dictating an individual’s emotions and actions, and they cannot simply be turned off or overridden with logic.
To combat the aversive social stress response, neuropsychologist Rhonda Freeman recommends engaging in positive social contact with friends or family to promote higher levels of calming oxytocin. However, this can be challenging since abusers often use isolation tactics like withholding calls and texts from supportive figures to distance their partners from friends and family, which allows them to wield more power over the victims, who become increasingly dependent on them.
To cope with their toxic situations, victims employ various unconscious tactics to rationalize and defend their partner’s behavior, leading them to overlook the severity of the abuse. Abusive relationships follow the cycle of violence, a pattern in which periods of violence are punctuated by honeymoon phases where the perpetrator apologizes, uses kind words or gestures and shifts the blame away from themselves. 
As they try to reconcile these starkly contrasting sides of their partner, victims experience cognitive dissonance: Modifying one perspective to alleviate the mental discomfort caused by two conflicting views of the same person. For example, they may justify their partner’s aggression by reasoning that it was a defense mechanism or the result of work stress rather than a pattern of toxicity. Cognitive dissonance is so powerful that a survey done by the National Institute of Mental Health found that more than half of domestic abuse victims still consider their partners “highly dependable,” which reveals that victims often fixate on the positive aspects of their partner and cling on to the hope that they are capable of improving.
In the end, domestic abuse inflicts significant psychological damage on the victim no matter the mental justification. Most commonly, victims experience depression or PTSD as a result of the abuse they have endured, both of which can contribute to feelings of helplessness and self-blame that make it more difficult to seek help.
Furthermore, Urtula’s circumstances may have been exacerbated by the stigma that men cannot be victims of abusive relationships. According to Sarah Wallace, a researcher who helped develop a support program for male domestic abuse victims, the men she works with often feel afraid and ashamed because they believe they have failed to fulfill traditional masculine ideals. 
Consequently, male victims are less likely to report domestic abuse and seek help. The exact rate of underreporting is difficult to estimate, but the British Crime Survey found that only 10% of men reported being abused to the police as opposed to 29% of women.
If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic abuse, please consider reaching out to the National Domestic Violence Hotline at (800) 799−7233, or messaging them at thehotline.org. Abuse can occur in emotional, verbal or financial forms, and anyone could be a victim, regardless of gender.

Many students who do not live in USC Housing may have noticed that the Department of Public Safety has been particularly strict about parties and other social gatherings this semester. This is because Los Angeles Ordinance No. 185451, which cracks down on loud or unruly gatherings in private residences, is in play. With the ordinance in place, the city of L.A. is mandated to shut down “loud or unruly gatherings” in private residences. 
With this context, DPS’s increased strictness on house parties makes a lot more sense. However, many students have begun to wonder why Greek Row, the source of USC’s loudest and arguably most unruly parties, has not been subject to this policing. It begs the question of just how effectively the USC community is working to equitably serve the purposes of this ordinance. 
The ordinance introduces a series of penalties for both landlords and tenants that host loud or unruly gatherings at a property they own or lease within 500 feet of a residence. Law enforcement is allowed to issue citations to responsible parties — and fines can total up to $8,000 by just the second offense. 
This may be harsh, but as of recently, it’s the law. But while students are penalized for throwing parties in independent housing, privately-owned frat houses are blasting music and serving drinks without having to abide by the same rules. What message does this send to USC students — that they can’t host an event with friends at their off-campus homes but can walk a block over and go to a huge frat party? After all, they risk a potential violation of the guidelines set by the Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards, as well as a heavy fine for the former and likely no punishment from DPS for the latter. 
For context, University Park is predominantly occupied by USC students and occupies a relatively small area of land north of campus. And as such, this seems to be the area that DPS most heavily patrols. 
The Row is situated right in the middle of this area, parallel to campus. And according to the USC website, these Greek houses are privately owned and subject to DPS and Los Angeles Police Department policing. So, given the new ordinance, why are these loud and unruly gatherings seemingly ignored by DPS while other gatherings in the area are shut down?
Ironically, there is even more reason to police frat parties because they are actually places in which greater harm to students and the community is more likely to occur. For example, just last year, a number of USC frat houses were placed on suspension for alleged hazing violations and drug usage. 
One of the enumerated goals of this ordinance is to prevent gatherings that are a threat to the general public due to, among other things, service of alcohol to minors and public drunkenness. According to a study done by U.S. National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health, out of six unique college settings — residence halls, Greek houses, off-campus residences, campus events, outdoor settings and bars/restaurants — the prevalence of drinking to intoxication was highest among Greek settings at 62.8%. 
The Addiction Center writes, “approximately 83 percent of Greek housing residents report having suffered as a result of their brothers’ and sisters’ alcohol consumption.” And more than this, a key point of these parties is that they’re exclusive to certain students. They are specifically meant for those who pay to be in Greek life. So, why are these events still happening at the same caliber despite new rules?
To be clear, the point here is not necessarily that we as college students should stop socializing and safely partying on the Row — or anywhere, for that matter. Rather, the University’s strict upholding of this new ordinance is biased. If a student is able to rush and live in a USC-sanctioned frat house and throw massively loud parties while another student is harshly penalized for having a smaller event just a block away in their own independent housing, we as a community are not effectively and fairly serving the city by working to combat what the ordinance is in place to prevent. 
Whether or not the ordinance itself is justified, it should at least be fairly upheld at and by the University.

After a four- to five-year hiatus, four students revived the undergraduate moot court team, which simulates appellate court trials, after realizing their common interest in criminal law during this year’s case competition. 
The team took home fifth and ninth place at the Western Regionals last weekend at California State University, Fresno. It also won individual awards for the second- and ninth-best orators out of 70 people. 
Shauli Bar-On, a junior majoring in political science, and Harmon Gill, a junior majoring in communication, were a part of the team that placed fifth, which puts them in a position to qualify for nationals. Michael Jeung, a senior majoring in political science, and Robert Ota, a senior majoring in communication, took ninth place. 
“To be able to culminate that into a moot court competition with these very real and relevant issues … and we’re making very real legal arguments with very legal thinking on our part. I think it was a really cool and fascinating experience,” Gill said. 
The four students met three to four times a week in the evenings to prepare oral arguments and quizzed each other as judges. The team also received guidance from their faculty advisers associate professor of political science Arthur Auerbach, assistant professor of writing Antonio Elefano and student moot court competitors at the Gould School of Law, who posed as judges and asked hypothetical questions to simulate a competition trial. 
Auerbach explained that the overall practice timeline included meeting with the team, analyzing different sides of issues and improving critical thinking skills. 
“It’s really just practice over and over and over and going through the different case law, as well as the fact pattern and understanding the sort of legal cleavages that are set out in the cases,” Auerbach said. 
Elefano said pre-law students should join moot court to develop skills that could be required in law school and future legal professions, including appellate argumentation. 
“These are skills that are typically developed in law school, precisely because it’s very difficult,” Elefano said. “It requires not just a command of one’s case — it requires a sort of command over the area of law that you’re dealing with.”
The typical moot court team prepares for competition season as early as the previous spring semester, Gill explained. However, since USC’s undergraduate team was formed in Fall 2019, the team only had one month to prepare.  
“I think the biggest challenge … was that we kind of just did this on our own,” Jeung said. “We saw that there was a niche in the body of undergraduate organizations that were available. And we saw that we wanted to fill that niche, we just did a leap of faith, and we just went after it ourselves.” 
Jim Lee, Gould’s assistant director of undergraduate recruitment and outreach, said he hopes the new undergraduate team will better introduce pre-law students to the field. 
“[We hope moot court students gain] the knowledge of law, what the legal profession itself,” he said. “Really just anything law-related since they can really … I’m not too familiar with moot court in general … We’re rooting for them as they compete but we also want to develop them as professionals and academically as well.” 
The team is applying to be a registered student organization for Spring 2020 and hopes to recruit more members in coming semesters. It also plans to compete in at least two tournaments next semester in Long Beach and San Francisco. 
“We’re really excited to be able to go to some of these tournaments with the new members that we’ll have in the spring because I think that’ll put us on the path to having a really really strong, grounded preparation for the fall for the next regionals,” Gill said.

Chris Harrison, host of “The Bachelor” and other shows in the franchise, discussed diversity and the behind-the-scenes of the reality television series to an audience of more than 200 in Wallis Annenberg Hall Monday.
Two minutes before Harrison was set to arrive in a Wallis Annenberg Hall classroom to speak about his career and experience with the ABC reality television show, the event was relocated to the auditorium to accommodate the influx of audience members. The event was hosted by Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism associate professor of professional practice Mary Murphy for her journalism class titled “Entertainment, Business and Media in Today’s Society.”
One audience member said that despite loving the show, she has noticed a lack of people of color on it. She said she roots for the people who look like her just so she can see them on television more. She asked if the producers are conscious of this and if more representation can be expected in the future.  
Harrison said the show casts people from across the country and focuses on their potential storylines, but he admitted that it did not do a good job at assembling a diverse cast when it first started in 2002. He claimed that representation has improved in the franchise.
“It was incumbent on us to change that narrative, and we have done that,” Harrison said. “Over the last several years, we have taken great strides in … trying to make you feel more represented. While I would love to only make great social statements and really change the world, I can’t just do that because we have to stay on the air … or I’m not making a social statement to anyone.”
Harrison also explained that many of the people behind the cameras are of different races and sexual orientations. 
Representation in the franchise came up again when another student asked about the likelihood of casting a gay bachelor. Harrison ultimately said that he does not know if or when it would happen. 
Harrison said he doesn’t believe “The Bachelor” changes culture but that the show has evolved as culture has changed. He brought up Rachel Lindsay, the first African American bachelorette in the show’s 13th season, and Demi Burnett, the first contestant to have a same-sex relationship on the franchise in the fifth season of “Bachelor in Paradise” as examples of the show’s evolution.
“You have to take it as it comes … because then it’s organic and then it feels right,” Harrison said. “When you try to force things is when it backfires on you … We took that step in that we had our first African American, but I didn’t look at her and go, ‘So happy she’s Black.’ I’m happy that she’s a badass woman, and oh by the way she also happens to be African American.”
When discussing the line between actual reality and reality made for television, Harrison emphasized that the contestants are real people who he and the producers care about, drawing parallels to his experience as a father of two teenagers. 
“You kind of have to take your hand off the wheel and let stuff happen,” Harrison said, explaining the true reality aspect of “The Bachelor.” 
None of what the contestants say, he said, is ever scripted. However, the producers create environments and moments that force contestants to “deal with each other.”
Throughout the entire event, which went overtime because of the large number of audience questions, Harrison made inside-jokes that referenced the most recent seasons of “The Bachelor” franchise and joked with the audience.
“It was really cool to see him, because we’re so used to seeing him on camera,” said Maggie Morris, a junior majoring in journalism. “And for him to be in person so down to earth, it was great.”
