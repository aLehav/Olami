Recently, the USC Ski & Snowboard team competed in two rounds of regional qualifiers at Mt. High and China Peak. The team qualified for the Southwest regional competition, which will take place this weekend. If they advance, they’ll compete at the National Championships next month.
The competitions, sponsored by the United States Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association, draws student-athletes from more than 175 colleges and universities.
At nationals last year, then-senior Ali Hsueh placed second and third in boardercross and slalom. Together, Hsueh and then-sophomore Chloe Barker secured a third-place team finish in slopestyle.
This year, Regionals and Nationals will be hosted by Mammoth Mountain, a weekly training ground for the club team.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Head Coach and senior Nick Ford expressed his excitement for the home mountain advantage.
“We’re the only team that can consistently go up, so not only do we have easy access to the mountain, we have plenty of time to train on the courses and fire everyone up to do it,” Ford said. “We’re going to have a good crew.” 
The USC Ski & Snowboard team consists of 182 undergraduate and graduate students. Most members participate recreationally, but for those who do compete, Ford finds that it can be an enriching experience.
“These competitions are a great way to get everyone up to a new level of confidence and progress their level of skiing to places they haven’t necessarily been,” Ford said. “But we’re all doing that under the lens of having some fun.”
In late January, the team competed at Mt. High for the first round of regional qualifiers. 
Junior Chloe Barker finished seventh in slopestyle and fourth in giant slalom for women’s snowboarding. Barker’s run positioned USC sixth overall in giant slalom. 
As for men’s snowboarding, USC junior Jesse Tennant and graduate student Angelo “Gelo” Winings combined to secure a third-place finish in giant slalom. Tennant and Winings finished eighth and ninth, respectively. Winings also placed first and second in slopestyle and rail jam.
Junior Shane Cole placed first in slopestyle and giant slalom, second in rail jam, and third in slalom. Cole’s third-place ranking in slalom positioned USC in sixth place. In the team giant slalom event, Cole and junior Adam Bradford placed first. 
Last weekend, the team competed at China Peak. While some athletes had already qualified for regionals, China Peak presented an opportunity to improve their results. 
In women’s snowboarding, Barker finished fifth in slopestyle. 
In men’s ski slopestyle, Ford finished first, while Cole took third. 
The remaining rankings have yet to be released.
Following the qualifiers, Ford is optimistic about the prospect of nationals.
“We’ve got a lot of good athletes. Last year, we only had two athletes go, but this year, I’m thinking triple that,” Ford said.
Like Ford, Cole is enthusiastic about the season.
“I’ve been telling everyone, half jokingly but half serious: I want to win — we could win it,” Cole said. “I really feel like we could take home the W this year while having a ton of fun doing it on our home mountain.”

Correction: A previous version of this article referred to USC Ski & Snowboard as a club. USC Ski & Snowboard is a club team. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.
Editor’s note: Not all results from the China Peak regional qualifiers have been published at the time of publication.

Industry guests talked candidly about the emotional struggles artists face working in the business and the resilience it takes to break into the entertainment realm at the Multihyphenate Masterclass. The event was hosted and moderated by the School of Dramatic Arts’ Chair of Performance Michele Shay at Bing Theatre Saturday. 
Multihyphenate describes celebrities with multiple skills or talents, such as acting, producing and writing. 
Jonas Pate, the screenwriter and producer of the Netflix series, “Outer Banks,” discussed how his plans to go to law school altered when he got an internship at Merchant Ivory, a production film company, during his senior year of college. Then, shortly after graduation, he got a job at Miramax and wrote a script that made it to Sundance. 
“The way to advance your career was to write,” Pate said. “So I grabbed every book on writing that I could find. I started to read about the filmmakers and how they had done it, I wrote a script, and then I had a friend who wanted to be a producer … The two of us came out to L.A. and started banging on doors and we eventually raised a million bucks.”
Pate emphasized the importance of staying resilient; the ability to tell stories is something that he will always have complete control over, no matter what the result may be.
“You’re going to get kicked in the teeth a lot,” Pate said. “You just gotta get back out. I’ve always.”
Isabelle Messner, a freshman majoring in theater, said she appreciated Pate’s advice about how everyone in the business should write, especially when feeling stuck. 
“Writing gives you a lot of agency,” Messner said. “It gives you a lot more power and a lot more motivation to keep going.” 
This power allowed Pate to successfully write three seasons of one of Netflix’s top hits and give “Outer Banks” actor Chase Stokes his big break. 
Stokes’ rise in the industry was far from traditional. Originally a hockey player, he changed paths when an eighth concussion forced him to reconsider his future with his health in mind. The lightbulb moment came when, during his time doing television production in high school, his teacher told him to take a shot at acting. 
Stokes, a Florida-native, took up roles in commercials, worked bartending jobs to sustain himself while he auditioned, dug himself into an almost $30,000 debt and, at one point, slept in his car on and off for six months when he found himself unhoused and with nowhere to go. 
But, now, on the other side of adversity, Stokes described his gratitude for the experience.
“There’s a journey that I think is necessary for any artist, not just an actor, to really feel all of the different emotions,” Stokes said. “In order to truthfully tell a story and have an authentic take on those things, you have to actually experience them.”
His authenticity is precisely what landed him his role in “Outer Banks.” 
“My advice would be to be vulnerable — be yourself,” Pate said. “That’s your best shot.”
Stokes and Pate’s stories struck a chord with the audience, who attended to gain insight on how to navigate the unreliable waters of the entertainment industry.
“I definitely think that I learned a lot about how to stay resilient in the business because it’s so tough,” said Brooklyn Nelson, a freshman majoring in acting, stage and screen. “Hearing both of their stories … I was inspired to keep going.”
The masterclass not only focused on the resilience it takes to become an artist but also delved into the courage necessary for artists to shed themselves in order to create work that viewers can resonate with.
“You have to open up your heart and create art that you want other people to see,” Shay said. 
Panelists Judith Light and Larry Powell discussed the importance of using art as a means to provide for others. 
“The work that you do is your service,” actor Light said. “It’s your gift to someone else. This business is not about you.”
The multihyphenates encouraged artists who struggle with imposter syndrome to get out of themselves and focus on finding ways to contribute to society. To them, acts of service outside your craft allows you to find a community and serves as a reminder that you are a human before you are an artist.
“You don’t have to be anything — you already are something,” Light said.

Just over a week ago, hockey’s greatest talents descended on southern Florida for an unusually tropical rendition of NHL All-Star Weekend.
That means we’re over halfway through the NHL season and, with playoffs just three months away, we’ve seen enough hockey to gauge how much every team has, or has not, lived up to its preseason forecast. Here’s a deep dive into a team that fits into each of those categories.
The overachievers: Boston Bruins
Let’s start out on a positive note with who’s performing better than expected: Boston. You’d have a hard time finding a fan base happier right now than the Bruins faithful.
Last season, Boston clawed their way into the playoffs, finishing fourth in the Atlantic Division and seventh in the Eastern Conference with 107 points. They faced off against the second-seeded Carolina Hurricanes in the opening round of the postseason and fell just short, losing by one goal in the seventh and final game of the series. 
The offseason was filled with uncertainty for the Bruins, as they quickly fired Head Coach Bruce Cassidy, and longtime captain Patrice Bergeron contemplated retirement. The possible end of Bergeron’s playing career was also a reminder that the core who had carried Boston for over a decade was aging fast. 
The Bruins took a risk and brought in Jim Montgomery to man the helm. He had held just one head coaching job before — he was fired after a single season, and later checked himself into rehab for alcohol abuse. Since then, he had been serving as an assistant coach on the St. Louis Blues staff. 
After Montgomery was introduced, Bergeron was brought back alongside fan-favorite David Krejci, both on one-year deals. With these deals, many labeled this season “The Last Dance,” as it would likely be the last chance for the remaining members of Boston’s 2011 Championship team to kiss the cup one final time. 
No one expected the Bruins to be cup favorites, but that’s exactly what they have become. The team has been rolling since the first puck drop back in October. At the time of this writing, they firmly sit atop the entire NHL with a 39-8-5 record and 83 points. That’s right, they’ve taken the ice 52 times this season and have yet to suffer double digits regulation losses. It took until late January for them to lose a game in regulation at home! 
Maybe the largest contributor to the Bruins’ success is David Pastrnak. Pastrnak is contending for the Hart trophy, the NHL’s MVP award. He’s fifth in the NHL in points with 72 and second in goals with 38. 
Boston is the epitome of a team clicking on all cylinders, as Montgomery, a Coach of the Year Favorite, has taken largely the same roster from last season and has them playing at a far superior level. People thought this team just caught lightning in a bottle to begin the season, but they’ve held that lightning all year. 
The underachievers: Florida Panthers
The Panthers are one of the most interesting teams in the NHL. Last year, they came out of nowhere and dominated en route to the President’s Trophy, awarded to the NHL’s best regular season team, with a 58-18-6 record adding up to a whopping 122 points. There is a common notion in the hockey world that the squad that hoists the President’s Trophy often isn’t able to do the same with the Stanley Cup. This rang true for Florida. 
They were a highly exciting team during the regular season, often competing in high-scoring affairs. The Panthers led the league in goals and shots per game with 4.11 and 37.34 respectively. Despite last year’s playoffs having an abnormal abundance of goals, their offensive aptitude did not help them much in the postseason. 
After taking care of business against the Washington Capitals in the first round, the Panthers were swept in embarrassing fashion by the Tampa Bay Lightning, their in-state rival. Florida was thoroughly out-classed in the second-round series, as the reigning champions showed them what playoff hockey really means. 
Despite having the main stars on their roster returning to the team for this season, Florida was not satisfied and made a splash in free agency. The Panthers traded for and signed Matthew Tkachuk to an eight-year $76 million contract. Tkachuk, the MVP of the recent All-Star game, is not only a highly-skilled player but a bonafide hothead. He won’t let anyone disrespect or cheap-shot his team and is ready to drop the gloves at all times. The Panthers likely hoped that he could bring some toughness to a lineup that showed a lack of it in last year’s playoffs.
While people still had their doubts, almost everyone still had the Panthers cemented as a top ten team entering this season. As it currently stands, Florida is clinging to Eastern Conference’s final playoff spot, just two points ahead of the Buffalo Sabres. 
Florida has a 26-23-6 record for 58 points, which is quite disappointing for a squad that ran away with the President’s Trophy last season. Similar to last year, they have no shortage of scoring, currently sitting at 6th in the NHL with 3.47 goals per game. However, a defense that was passable last year has taken a step down. The Panthers are 10th worst in goals allowed per game with 3.44 and 12th worst in save percentage with .902.
Simply put, their defense is not good enough to be carried by the offense anymore. Last year, their offense was out-of-this-world, allowed them to mask their defensive struggles until playoff time. This year, they have not been afforded the same luxury. 
So, now, not only do you know the puck lingo, but you should now be able to give an in-depth analysis on two of the NHL’s most fascinating teams.

As an accidentally self-branded astrology fanatic, people ask for my thoughts on their potential partners’ zodiac signs more often than you’d think. But as much as I love to talk about astrology, a part of me can’t help but groan every time I’m asked this question; I simply never have enough information to give a fair assessment. Although there are pretty well-known generalizations about people’s sun signs, I usually find myself grasping at straws to draw any parallel to their sun sign and love.
So, out of this frustration, I’ve decided to put together a guide of what you need to know about your potential partner before you ask your astrology friend for their opinions, and some things to look for so you can determine compatibility yourself as we head into Valentine’s Day.
Step one: Get their whole birth chart
If you have them on Snapchat, chances are you can view their birth chart on the app. Just go to their profile, click the zodiac sign icon next to their snap score, and click “View [insert name here]’s Astrological Profile.” Don’t worry, Snapchat has your back and will not notify them that you’re doing this.
If you don’t have them on Snapchat — or the person doesn’t have the feature set up (major red flag, in my opinion) — unfortunately the only way to find their chart is by inputting their birth date, time and location into a birth chart calculator. It’s difficult, but there are ways to do this without blowing your cover, or making them suspicious that you’re a stalker. 
The location is probably the easiest. When you’re talking about your hometowns, just slip in a quick “Were you born there?” Gets the job done and makes you seem that much more interested in their life. For birth date and time, I’d go the route of awkwardly sharing yours and seeing if they reciprocate. They’ll probably catch on at this point, but it’s worth a shot.
Be sure to have your chart handy as well for the following comparisons.
Step two: The Venus sign
Venus is the sign of love, romance and beauty. It determines what someone looks for in love and how they act in a relationship. If you’re attracted to someone’s energy, chances are it’s because of their Venus sign. Venus also determines what someone finds beauty in generally, not just in people. For example, air Venuses are likely to find beauty in intellect, while earth Venuses are more likely to find it in comfort and nature. 
Green flags include them having the same Venus sign as you, your Venuses being “sister signs” (at opposite sides of the zodiac wheel, six signs apart) or their Venus sign being the same as any of your big six — or vice versa. 
Step three: The “little three”
While most who dabble in astrology know their “big three” (sun, moon and rising), I’m a strong advocate that out of the big six astrology signs, the “little three” — Mercury, Venus and Mars — say the most about a person.
Compatible Mercury signs are a plus, especially if you’re looking for something long term. Mercury rules communication, so if theirs is in the same sign or element as yours, it could be a clue that you’ll have vibrant conversations and little issues with communication. 
Look for similar patterns in Mars, which rules sex and aggression. Aside from the obvious, compatibility in Mars can foreshadow how you’ll deal with conflicts should they arise. 
To take it to the next level, look at aspects between your and your potential partner’s Mars and Venus signs. Conjunctions — when two planets are in the same sign — can strengthen the energy of the sign, a good thing to look out for in this case. Sextiles (two signs apart) are associated with light, easygoing energy. Trines (four signs apart) are the luckiest aspects. However, beware of squares (three signs apart), as these can cause conflict. 
Step four: Sun and moon signs
Astrological compatibility is all about balance. Who can guide a Taurus moon out of their shell? Or a Capricorn sun out of their work-focused mind? Who can bring out the parts of yourself that you don’t like to show the rest of the world, and who can do that for you in return? 
One of the biggest things I look out for in terms of compatibility is a pair’s sun and moon signs. You’re most compatible with someone who has the same sun sign as your moon sign or vice versa. Your sun is the way you fit into the world and your moon is how you deal with your innermost emotions, the ones usually kept hidden. With the right balance, you’ll be able to guide these parts out of each other, strengthening your connection.
Step five: Dominant element
Out of the four elements — water, earth, fire and air — there’s usually one that’s more prevalent in one’s chart. Typically, people who have the same dominant element are compatible because they hold a lot of the same values and tendencies. Otherwise, water- and earth-dominant people tend to get along, and same with fire and air dominants. Again, these energies are all about balance. 
Step six: Make a decision
While there’s a seemingly infinite number of aspects and placements one can look at when determining compatibility, it’s not feasible to go over every single one. There’s also probably no pair that’s completely astrologically compatible. 
Nonetheless, you probably went into this journey looking to get something out of it, and this spiel is likely irrelevant. If you couldn’t contain your excitement about your compatible Venus signs or grew uneasy at your Venus-Mars conjunction, that’s what matters. At the end of the day, trust your gut. The stars are just here to help.

The Trojans’ hopes of participating in the NCAA Tournament took a major uppercut as USC fell to Oregon State 61-58 in a late-game heartbreaker. With the Trojans trailing by three points in the waning moments of the game, senior guard Boogie Ellis’ left-wing 3-point look caromed off the back rim to hand the Trojans their eighth loss on the season. 
In a game barren of positives for USC, true freshman forward Vincent Iwuchukwu once again proved to be one of the lone bright spots for the squad. The 7’1” forward was overpowering on both ends of the floor, playing a career-high 25 minutes and finishing with a career-high 19 points on 5-10 shooting. Iwuchukwu also had three blocks. 
Iwuchukwu botched an alley-oop layup as the Trojans trailed by one point with under a minute to go. However, the forward displayed prolific touch from the free throw line, hitting all nine of his attempts — a rare trait for young big men in college basketball. While the Trojans may not find themselves competing for the national championship, this season will prove vital for Iwuchukwu’s development.
Outside of the starting forward, there was little to write home about for USC. The guard trio of Ellis, fifth-year guard Drew Peterson and freshman guard Tre White combined to hit just eight of their 29 field goal attempts. Throw in sophomore guard Kobe Johnson’s subpar night, and the Trojans’ starters outside of Iwuchukwu shot a horrid 30% from the field. 
Head Coach Andy Enfield prefers to lean heavily on his starting unit, but finding a winning formula during a poor shooting night from veteran leaders like Ellis and Peterson in a must-win game was a tall and seemingly futile task. 
“Something has to go down if you’re going to beat a team on the road,” Enfield said in an interview with 247 Sports. “It wasn’t like we were taking bad shots. We got pretty much what we wanted.”
The Beavers’ bench unit provided a strong scoring punch, winning the battle of the benches 20-3. Senior forward Dzmitry Ryuny delivered three back-breaking threes off the bench for the Beavers, raining heavily contested jumpers over the Trojans in the second half. 
Freshman guard Jordan Pope and sophomore forward Glenn Taylor Jr.  were the primary driving forces behind the Beavers’ win Saturday. Pope, who leads all Pac-12 freshmen in scoring, put up 16 points and 3 assists — including a sweet pull-up mid-range jump shot to give the Beavers a 3-point lead with just over two minutes remaining.
Taylor relentlessly attacked the rim all night, finishing with a team-high 18 points on 7-15 shooting. Despite the Beavers’ failure to convert a field goal in the paint for the first nine and a half minutes of the game, Taylor was not deterred; The 6’6” forward attacked the 7’1” Iwuchukwu with the game on the line, initially getting swatted but finishing the putback layup for the go-ahead bucket that would prove to be the game-clinching field goal. 
The Trojans made just a single 3-pointer compared to 6 from the Beavers which accounted for the true difference in the ballgame. USC misfired on 13 of 14 shots, the lowest three-point percentage the Trojans have shot during Enfield’s 10-year tenure as head coach. Enfield’s squad won the rebounding and points in the paint battle, but the offense came up short to close both halves. 
“We got good shots all night. We moved the ball,” Enfield said. “You’ve got to make more than one three though. I think Boogie’s seven threes, maybe six were pretty wide open.”
USC will look to extend its 12-game winning streak at Galen Center against the UC Berkeley Golden Bears Thursday, aiming to win out against Pac-12 opponents and keep their tournament hopes alive.

Several stories underground and fitted with moody blue lighting, Tommy’s Place became an intimate venue as students streamed in Friday for an evening of entertainment and Black celebration.
BlackSC Got Talent is one of the many events the Black Student Assembly organized in observance of Black History Month, and was the organization’s first competitive talent show.
Elande Abate and Miles Mogush, co-chairs of the BSA special events team, conceived the vision for the show. The duo modeled BlackSC Got Talent after a familiar namesake, “America’s Got Talent,” to highlight the creative skills and development of their contestants.
“This week, we really wanted to show off the arts of BlackSC,” said Mogush, a senior majoring in music industry and the production manager at Tommy’s Place. “We really want people to be rewarded for the talents that we have. And not just people that are in the performance majors … I really want to promote everyone that makes Black art.”
At the first-ever BlackSC Got Talent, the competition was strong. Four performers showcased a variety of singing, instrumental and dancing skills to impress the audience and a panel of judges. 
“We’re so diverse and multifaceted in our talents, what we can do, what we enjoy, our hobbies,” said Abate, a junior majoring in communications. “In all events with Black History Month this semester, we’re trying to tap into different areas of the Black community.”
Performers were given a couple weeks to rehearse and perfect their acts. Izzy Batiste, a first-year graduate student studying higher education, choreographed the whole routine for his dance troupe, BLK Elites, the only dancing act.
“I’m a perfectionist,” Batiste said. “I want everything to look a certain way, be a certain way. But it just really felt organic. Whenever we practiced together, it really felt like we all knew what we were doing and it kinda just just fell into place.”
The judges panel, composed of USC professors, faculty and students, provided feedback after each act and in the final rankings.
“The judges’ feedback was so essential,” said Jadon Wise, a singer in the talent show and a junior majoring in music industry. “I’m very, very grateful that we have the space to do this and grateful that they took the time out to actually work with us, give us advice and just really encourage us to keep doing what we’re doing.”
The judges crowned Keshell Phillips, a freshman majoring in pop music, the first-place winner of the show with her stunning cover of Whitney Houston’s “I Have Nothing.”
“Whitney Houston is a big one and it’s very risky,” Phillips said. “But I think that what I do, and what all artists should do when they choose a song, [is to] really figure out what that song means to you and what you want to do with it … Singing this song was kind of a fear for me, but to just step into my strengths and weaknesses and be true to myself, I was able to express it through that song.”
Between acts, Marlize Duncan, the show’s emcee and a senior majoring in  journalism, hyped up the crowd with stand-up comedy, games and fun facts about the performers. Audience members were invited on stage to participate in trivia about Black history. 
Anticipating a future BlackSC Got Talent, Duncan said she’s looking forward to seeing an even greater variety of talents next year.
“I feel like singing and dancing are some of the go-to talents that people will do for talent shows,” Duncan said. “But I want to see something out of the box. I want to see people juggle … beatboxing … comedy. I know people have talent. I think it’s more or less getting the guts to go up on stage and do that, even if it’s a bit different than what you would normally see on a talent show.”
Mary Ikeocha, a junior majoring in psychology and marketing and fellow musical contestant, said she appreciates the space USC provides for its Black students and wants to see it expand.
“I would just like to commend USC for having an open space and open heart for their Black students to come and be themselves and to show up here during Black History Month,” Ikeocha said. “Not every school can say that about themselves. We have a pretty prevalent Black population on campus. I think that it’s really amazing to see how we can all come together and enjoy activities and just share love.”

Young people are historical agents of change in American democracy. In the early 1970s, college students protested the Vietnam War by storming out of class across nearly 900 campuses nationwide. More recently, David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez, Alex Wind, Cameron Kaskey and Jaclyn Corin were collectively named 2018 TIME Person of the Year for their activism in the wake of the Parkland, Florida shooting. 
As young adults, we may not hold the same positions of power as older generations — but what we lack in bureaucracy we make up for in social influence. When young people start talking about something, society starts talking about it. 
Taking that into consideration, it is ironic that America’s youth refuses to discuss the largest threat to our future — the national debt. I encourage anyone reading this to visit usdebtclock.org. You’ll find that the national debt currently sits at $31 trillion. For comparison, the global population only consists of about 8 billion people.
With Congress running deficits every year since 2001 and showing no signs of slowing, the debt situation is getting more dire every year. Long gone are the Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich days of budget surpluses. Instead, we somehow find a way to spend more each year than we did the year before. Spending bills in the trillions were unheard of 10 years ago; today this is nothing out of the ordinary. 
Career politicians in Washington refuse to address this issue for two reasons. The first is a political argument. Balancing the budget demands unpopular solutions. The options are limited: raise taxes, cut spending or print money. None of these options are what a political scientist would consider a successful campaign initiative for politicians vying for re-election.
Second, politicians and a lot of the people voting for them are already nearing the end of their working careers. By the time the United States needs to pay off the debt, these people won’t be working. The strategy is simple: Spend money today and have our children pay for it later. Imagine going to a restaurant, ordering the most expensive item on the menu and leaving right before the bill arrives. 
Eventually, the day will come when we have to pick up the tab that the older generations left on the table. Gen Z and subsequent generations will spend their lifetime earnings paying their parents’ debt. Our taxes will be higher. Our income will be lower. We will be less prosperous than generations before us. 
Since we are the ones to deal with the repercussions, the burden falls on us to start the conversation. If we fail to address this, no one will. It is for this reason that I struggle to understand why we do not use our outlets — social media in particular — to raise awareness and put pressure on those in power. 
We are a vocal group when it comes to social issues. This is particularly true when it comes to climate change, for example. Greta Thunberg addressed the United Nations at 16 years old. It feels as though every high school in America has an environmental awareness club. March for Our Lives — a student-led movement to end gun violence — held more than 450 protests in 2022 alone. If we are so vocal about social issues, why can’t we apply the same activism toward fiscal matters?
Political partisans will attempt to pin the debt on the opposing party, but this could not be more hypocritical. The only thing Republicans and Democrats like to do more than spend money is to blame the other party for spending money. In the early 2000s, Democrats blasted then President George W. Bush for spending $3 trillion on the war in Iraq. President Obama then proceeded to increase the national debt by $8.6 trillion. After branding himself as the “king of debt,” President Trump increased the national debt by a whopping $7.8 trillion in just four years in office. Coupled with tax cuts that did not pay for themselves, Trump oversaw the third-largest deficit increase in presidential history. In a political climate where Republicans and Democrats can’t seem to agree on anything, perhaps running deficits stands as the lone exception. The problem is we have to pay for their stubborn disagreements.
If you are young and do not think the national debt affects you, you are mistaken. The United States is quickly approaching peak debt — the point at which a country accumulates so much debt that it cannot be paiwd off. The rise of modern monetary theory — a controversial macroeconomic theory that suggests governments can print money without resolve — is most alarming. 
If we do not start raising our voice, we will spend our working careers paying the debts cast by our parents. Even our children will be burdened by this. We are proven advocates for social change. It is high time we apply this same effort and passion to fiscal issues. Our future depends on it.

My column was founded on the principle that nobody should write off the South. It might be a bit self-centered for me to say this, but I think the Democrats are starting to listen. Have they wiretapped my apartment? My boots? Or maybe they’re reading I Reckon? Did a Democratic operative’s son or daughter happen to crack open the Daily Trojan one day and share it with their parents? Whatever it is, I’m just glad the Democrats are doing something to repent all the years spent writing off the South by making South Carolina the first presidential primary voting state. And, can I be the first to say that it took them damn long enough?
It is a seismic shift indeed, and something that I think we’ll just have to see unravel in the next presidential primary cycle to fully understand what the actual effect of this change will be. I’m sure we’re all more than accustomed to Iowa and New Hampshire being the first states to have their moments on the evening news during the primaries. All of the seemingly never-changing shots of voters in rural gymnasiums or banquet halls set an early tone for the rest of the nation to follow (or not). Well, all that is about to change, for the better.
Frankly, I don’t think the fact that this is happening during our lifetime is really appreciated enough by Gen Z, but if I said that aloud I think I’d start to sound ancient. This might seem like boring news that only my fellow annoying political science majors might be squabbling about, but there’s a great deal of significance in putting South Carolina in the front of the primary line. 
The Palmetto State single handedly revived now-President Joe Biden’s sputtering campaign in 2020, adding more credence to the trend that winners of the South Carolina primary usually go on to win the Democratic nomination. More importantly and unlike former first and second-place primary states Iowa and New Hampshire, South Carolina more accurately reflects the sheer diversity of the nation as a whole. If you break it down by the numbers, you’ll see what I mean. 
According to the most recent census data, Iowa is overwhelmingly white – about 90%. New Hampshire is not much different, with roughly 93% of the state’s population being white. The only reason why Iowa is still relevant is that it’s the first time presidential candidates get to perform at the voting booths, rather than through random polls. In the late 1960s, it’s complicated nominating process necessitated an early spot on the primary calendar. Beyond that, however, the Iowa caucus has long lost its relevance after 1976. This was when Jimmy Carter’s small campaign made a strong enough finish that Carter was able to capitalize on it and turn a dark horse campaign into an eventually successful one. Beyond that, there’s no reason Iowa still needs to be the first. It found its place first in line more or less because of a stroke of historical luck — there’s no intentionality behind it and New Hampshire’s primary positions. Knighting South Carolina to replace their spot in line represents an intentional change, not an accidental one, to give a larger microphone to states that more accurately reflect the racial makeup of the nation.
That’s not to say that South Carolina’s fancy new place in the queue is bound to be world-changing by any means. The state’s demographics are usually on the older side of the scale and are skewed a bit more moderately. These conditions might very well be more friendly to moderate candidates, such as the likes of Joe Biden back in 2020. But if that’s the way the cookie crumbles, then so be it. Isn’t that how a democracy is supposed to operate? 
If you’re expecting a political revolution of any kind to spring out of our democratic system and environment, especially without putting any elbow grease in, you’d have a better chance of catching rain in a strainer. Better yet, here’s a word for the wise presidential hopefuls and progressive, left-wing politicos: Don’t start thinking you’re entitled to the votes of people who you haven’t begun to reach out to. Change has to start somewhere, and it couldn’t start in a better place than a bellwether for the South like South Carolina.

The Marshall School of Business has a new embedded counselor: Andrew Iskandar. Iskandar’s embedment into Marshall is a part of a greater effort by the Counseling and Mental Health services team to provide easier access to their services. The program was initially launched in the cultural centers across campus. The School of Architecture, the Gould School of Law and the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, among others, also have embedded counselors.
The embedded counselor model was created in response to data USC got back from students in the 2019 Healthy Minds Study, according to the USC Student Health website. Forty percent of survey respondents said that they needed some sort of mental health support. 
Marshall appointed Iskandar, a licensed clinical social worker and clinical instructor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Keck School of Medicine, their embedded counselor at the start of Spring 2023. Iskandar previously worked with adults with autism and intellectual disabilities before earning his master’s degree in social work at USC and joining the Counseling and Mental Health department at Keck School of Medicine in 2015. 
“It’s something that I’ve been drawn to for basically my whole life,” Iskandar said of his career in social work and counseling. “Being in that world where you’re connecting with people and understanding how they see life and how they navigate all the problems that they come up against in life and just trying my best to see the world through someone else’s eyes [has] always been interesting.” 
Summer Zapata, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry and the behavioral sciences at Keck School of Medicine, said the decision to embed counselors was a strategic one, specifically targeting “certain academic schools where there were health disparities” — including Marshall. There is no cap to the number of sessions one can have with an embedded counselor, Zapata said. Instead, counselors attempt to create personalized treatment plans with students whether that entails short-term or long-term care.
“Marshall’s decision to embed a counselor is part of our commitment to student well-being and to making mental health a priority in our community,” wrote Maureen McHale, assistant dean and director of Undergraduate Advising and Student Affairs at Marshall, in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “By embedding a counselor, students will have access to a well-qualified mental health professional uniquely familiar with the Marshall undergraduate experience.”
Iskandar said he already has some experience with the unique challenges of Marshall students from his time at the Engeman.
“[Marshall students] are going into the world to be leaders, to be placed in business, to create things and there’s so much pressure on them,” Iskandar said. “There’s so much competition for them, there’s so much push for them to achieve these really high levels.” 
Iskandar said being able to help students in times of great personal stress is one of the best aspects of his job. 
“It’s really gratifying, it’s really great to be the person that they can kind of come back to themselves,” Iskandar said. “[Having] that stress come out of them and seeing how it’s affecting them and trying to understand who they are and what brought them to this place and get into this right mindset and be in this creative place where they can expand out into the world.”
Chloe Young, a freshman majoring in business, said she’s thankful that Marshall now has these resources, but felt that it is well needed in other schools as well. 
“Having [therapists] especially where Fertitta [is], having it in the same easy access is something that’s definitely helpful,” Young said. “A lot of different schools can really use the resource. I always hear my Viterbi friends super stressed out; They’re always studying hard.” 
Iskandar said he “has a lot of availability” now that he works almost exclusively with Marshall undergraduate students.
“I’ve only been at Marshall a couple weeks now,” Iskandar said, “but I can say that it’s been really exciting to meet everyone and to learn more about the ebbs and flows of what a Marshall student goes through.”
As a mental health professional, Iskandar understands the importance of participating in activities that help him destress, one of which is hiking.
“This is a beautiful area to just go out into the wilderness and just be out there with the sun and the sky and the birds and all that,” Iskandar said. “I like to go spend time with my friends and family.”

The Cardinal Divas are business as usual after their busy and history-making first semester. Since the team’s launch in September, the team has made appearances in Essence, BET and the Los Angeles Times, and made their national television debut on “The Jennifer Hudson Show.” Now, they want the world to know that they’re more than just majorettes.
Majorette dance is a style of dance that draws on jazz and hip hop techniques that was first established in historically Black colleges and universities across the nation. It holds great significance in Black and HBCU culture.
The founder and captain of the team, Princess Isis Lang, is a junior majoring in musical theater and was at the center of the attention the team received last semester. Lang said she decided to start the team to create a space for herself after not recognizing one at USC.
“I didn’t see any dance or cheer team that I wanted to be a part of here at USC,” Lang said. “I did the research, I looked around and everything, but I knew that if I joined one of these teams that I would have to change who I was, how I look, how I dress, how I dance.”
The Cardinal Divas shot to virality Sept. 18, when Lang posted a video of the group performing on Twitter. The video has more than 3.2 million views and 102,800 likes at the time of publication.
“oh nothing… i created a majorette team at a [predominantly white institution] and performed at our first game,” the tweet read. “truly though i’m so blessed and can’t thank God enough. Thank you to my parents and to everyone who supported me along this LONG journey. and my girls FYE. The Cardinal Divas of SC are UP NEXT.”
 Kyla Drew, a senior majoring in journalism and member of the team, said Lang wasn’t originally going to post the video. 
“We literally made her post it,” Drew said. “We were like, ‘No, this is a good video, you need to post.’”
Though the public response to the team’s virality was mixed, Drew and her teammates are expressing gratitude for the community support they did receive amid the backlash. Detractors argued that majorette style dance belongs only at HBCUs and that the Cardinal Divas overstepped in creating their team at a PWI. 
The response to Lang’s tweet was mixed. The group received support from a number of celebrities, including rapper and USC alum Saweetie, who tweeted: “SOOOOO PROUD.” On the other hand, one user demanded that Lang and her group “Stop giving these people our culture.”
We are growing as a team and people are starting to want us places. I just wish USC would open up their arms, as well.
“EXACTLY!” another user replied. “They definitely about to steal this and claim they created a ‘new’ style when HBCU’s been doing this for DECADES! It’s so irritating!”
Others sought to shut down such arguments, saying it was “such an unserious discourse.”
“Not Black folk gate keeping Black culture from other Black folk,” one such user wrote. “do yll [sic] really think the D9 [Divine 9 fraternities and sororities, also known as the National Pan-Hellenic Council] survives without chapters at PWIs?”
All the attention was a lot to handle for the team, Drew said, but “it’s been amazing,” regardless.
“It became kind of hard to balance [schoolwork and the team] when we were at our peak of media recognition,” Drew said. “I know we got some negative attention, but we really turned the negative into positive.”
Now, Ire Omitowoju, a junior majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation and a Cardinal Diva, said the team is still busy, but boosting her culture is worth it. 
“It’s a very diverse experience because we always have rehearsal, but then we’re doing a shoot or doing an interview another day,” Omitowoju said. “You know, it may be late, I may be tired, but at least I’m surrounded by people who I love, who I share similar culture to, and all we’re doing, really, is uplifting Black culture.”  
Omitowoju said she felt that the media had glossed over the team’s intentions for the team’s creation.
“I hope that people outside of [the team] understand why we have this team on the campus,” Omitowoju said. “It’s not about appropriation, it’s not about shining away from HBCU culture; but it’s really about highlighting it.”
Co-captain and senior dance major Jada Walker said she also wanted to remind others that the Cardinal Divas are normal people.
“I feel like the media missed the whole part of just Black girls starting something that’s truly for us … and also just who we are as people.” Walker said. “We’re girls who laugh and talk. We do the same things everyone else do.”
Jai Robinson, a senior majoring in dance and the team’s choreographer, said he was surprised to find that the team meshed so well.
“The biggest thing that I didn’t expect was everybody to be so close. It’s really like a big family,” Robinson said. “We all go out to eat sometimes, we just hang out. Our rehearsals are a whole bunch of fun. It doesn’t really feel like work and I really love that aspect of it.” 
Robinson and Lang are both members of the NPHC, a collection of Black fraternities and sororities. Robinson said he first got involved with the team after he approached Lang and asked to choreograph the audition piece, but his role quickly evolved. 
“I started doing a lot of other things that really aren’t under my role but, since me and Princess are good friends, it was no problem. Then I started to be more of a coach,” Robinson said. 
He said that throughout his experience with the team, his favorite memory has probably been their appearance on “The Jennifer Hudson Show.” 
“We really had a good time, we were all fangirling over Jennifer and it was just really amazing,” Robinson said. 
Drew said her favorite experience was the team’s performance at the Homecoming game during the football season. 
“I wasn’t able to experience homecoming my junior year [of high school] and then, obviously, [the coronavirus pandemic] restricted me from attending my first two years,” Drew said. “So being able to have that first homecoming experience and being able to dance in the stands, and that energy in the band and the crowd, and then we won — it was honestly life-changing.”
Many of the team’s members are seniors who Walker said hope to leave behind a growing program that eventually gains recognition from USC Athletics. Walker said when reflecting on their Jan. 16 performance at the Martin Luther King Day parade in Leimert Park, she wishes they could’ve been included alongside the Trojan Marching Band.
“It was a fun experience; We got to see the band before they took off, but it was just very unfortunate that we couldn’t be a part of it with them,” Walker said. “We are growing as a team and people are starting to want us places. I just wish USC would open up their arms, as well.” 
Lang said that while the team faces financial challenges, being entirely self-funded and reliant on donations, that hasn’t stopped her, and the team is going to keep expanding.
“Yes, tryouts are happening,” Lang said. “So, we gonna keep pushing and, as my friends say, ‘Princess make it happen.’ Period.”
