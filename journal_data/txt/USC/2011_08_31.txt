USC Libraries fully implemented its first suggestion from the Essential Ideas website by extending the Von KleinSmid Center  library hours this week.
The site allows USC community members to post suggestions related to libraries and allows other members to vote for posted suggestions.
After receiving 140 votes, a suggestion to extend hours at the Von KleinSmid Center Library was implemented. The library now open three hours longer to 10 p.m. Monday through Thursday and to 8 p.m. on Sunday.
Previous customer surveys had already brought the issue to USC Libraries’ attention. Hugh McHarg, executive director of communications and public programming for USC Libraries, said this is the first time a suggestion has fully gone through the process of getting votes, being reviewed by USC Libraries and going into effect.
“Extending the hours is not a surprising change because it’s something that kept coming up,” McHarg said. “Students said they wanted [various] other libraries to be open later as well, and these requests consolidated in this more general suggestion to extend VKC’s hours.”
McHarg said USC Libraries expects to see more activity on Essential Ideas this year after the website launched toward the end of last semester.
“It’s been in a pilot phase until now and, as the semester progresses, we expect more folks to catch on and start participating,” McHarg said. “We’re looking forward to an active and vocal group telling us what that they need from our libraries.”
Suggestions currently under review include an initiative to make HOMER more easily searchable, adding more electrical outlets in Doheny Library, allowing online study room reservations and adding more vegetarian options at LiteraTEA. McHarg said USC Libraries is also planning to make printing available at Doheny.

Internships are becoming a key component for students when they apply for jobs after college.
Career advice · A student during the February 2011 career fair talks to a prospective employer. Internships have been on the rise, and summer jobs spiked. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The youth labor force, defined as all people between the ages of 16 and 24 working or actively looking for work, grew to 22.7 million in July 2011, an 11.8 percent increase from last year, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Aug. 24.
Though the youth labor force usually expands during the summer, as young adults seek summer employment and internships, this summer’s spike is the largest since the recession hit in late 2007.
Carl Martellino, associate dean for student affairs and executive director of the Career Center, attributed the influx of young adults in the labor market to an increased emphasis on internships as a gateway to full-time jobs.
“Over the past several years there has been an increase in students seeking internships,” Martellino said. “Students are understanding with more clarity that internships are leading people into full time positions.”
With an increasingly competitive job market, Elizabeth Adabale, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, said she feels pressured to find jobs early.
“I think it is great that more and more students are working,” Adabale said.  “But when there aren’t enough jobs for people who want to work, that’s when it becomes a problem.”
Some students also feel the pressure to find a job to become financially independent. Monish Tyagi, president of Undergraduate Student Government, said in an email, however, students believe summer jobs are critical for their resumes.
“There are several students who work out of financial necessity, but I also believe that the uncertainty in the economy and job market has caused students to think that if they do not spend their summers working, it will ultimately be detrimental to their future success,” Tyagi said.
Other students believe taking classes is a better use of their time and provides better preparation for careers after college.
“I don’t feel guilty because I took class instead of working,” said Nakul Joshi, a sophomore majoring in computer engineering and computer science.
Aside from the uncertainty and pressure, students might be motivated to find a job to further their education.
“I want an internship because my education would be relevant,” Joshi said. “It would be nice to use the things I learn at work.”
I remember when a college degree used to be the key to getting a job. I guess now, you need an internship. Huh. I don’t really like the idea of USC encouraging their students to work for free, but if the USC degree can’t get people paid work, well, Students will have to do what they need to, to survive. 
At least USC has a free program to help students get an internship. I hear other schools make their students pay for a course, to get an internship. The Students pay, so they can work for free! isn’t that crazy? Paying tuition and a course fee to work for someone else, for free? Some might say that is a …racket. There may be truth to that, if you think about it, but like I said, at least USC students don’t have to worry about that. Thanks to their parents and tough alumni, USC students don’t have to pay any such extra fees, just so they can work for free.

The USC Marshall School of Business is readying its new six-year strategic plan that includes 12 initiatives Marshall hopes will change the way business schools across the country approach undergraduate education.
Initiatives introduced in the plan include a brand new building for undergraduate business students, increased interdisciplinary collaboration with every school on campus, a teacher mentor program and a proposed three-degree global program, according to Deborah MacInnis, Marshall’s vice dean for research and strategy.
Marshall’s previous strategic plan ended in December 2010.
The timing was right to refocus now that President C. L. Max Nikias introduced the Campaign for the University of Southern California, the university’s new $6 billion capital campaign, according to MacInnis. The university’s new strategic plan is set to be released later this fall.
Most of the funding for Marshall’s initiatives will be raised as part of the Campaign for the University of Southern California. The fundraising goal set for Marshall and the Leventhal School of Accounting is $400 million.
Marshall’s new strategic plan will focus heavily on expanding its global initiatives.
“We want to send every single undergraduate student on an overseas experience while they are at Marshall,” said Jim Ellis, dean of Marshall School of Business.  “At some point we will make it a requirement.”
A program has also been proposed for future Marshall undergraduate students where three of their four undergraduate years would be spent abroad in Europe and Asia, receiving a degree from USC and all of the  institutions they attend overseas.
“In today’s business world [global strategy] is critical to the success of anyone operating in that environment because there are no [longer] boundaries in business,” Ellis said. “In order to be a successful business person today, you have to know how cultures work and you have to understand how currencies and markets work.”
Fifty million dollars will go to a new, state-of-the-art building dedicated entirely to undergraduate business students.
“We are out of space,” said Ellis, who teaches his own class in Taper Hall of Humanities. “A number of years ago we cut the size of our classes, so we have a better ratio between the professors and the students. When you do that you just need more classrooms.”
Business students agreed that there is a need for a new building and were excited to hear about the new plans.
“A new building will be great,” said Mateo Epshteyn, a senior majoring in business administration. “The business building feels like a business building. The other buildings are much more welcoming.”
The new building is expected to be located on the corner of Figueroa Street and Exposition Boulevard, taking the space of the old registration office, and will offer the latest in technology and architectural design.
The strategy will include the hiring of 25 new faculty members. They will be able to partake in a future mentorship program, where veteran faculty will help teach, train and support them when needed.
Students are now playing an integral part in shaping the history of Marshall. MacInnis said she is currently in the process of forming teams that will make the broad ideas proposed in the strategic plan more concrete.
Teams are comprised of students, faculty and staff and will have until November to present their plans for the next six years.
Ellis and his staff hope the new strategic plan will enhance the educational experience at Marshall.
“We want our students to have the best experience,” Ellis said.  “We want them to learn the most and do that in the best environment. That’s what life at USC is all about. Only the best.”

The USC women’s soccer program received its first ever gift of endowment thanks to generous donors within the Trojan Family.
The Mehdi Khosroshahin Head Soccer Coach Endowment will provide the salary for the university’s head soccer coach and begin a $14 million campaign to assist soccer student-athletes.
Winner · USC coach Ali Khosroshahin has led the women’s soccer team to four consecutive NCAA appearances, including a 2007 NCAA title. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“This generous gift of endowment is particularly significant to our soccer program as it marks the first gift of its kind to this sport,” USC Athletic Director Pat Haden told USCTrojans.com. “This endowment will go a long way in helping ensure the success of Trojan soccer for years to come.”
Mehdi Khosroshahin is the father of current USC coach Ali Khosroshahin, who is the only coach in Pac-12 history to win a national championship in women’s soccer.
A native of Iran, Mehdi taught his children the importance of academics and moved his family to the United States in the 1970s. The Khosroshahins eventually settled in California, where Mehdi saw both his children earn college degrees and develop a passion for the game of soccer.
“My dad got me here, and now he’s our number one fan,” said Ali Khosroshahin, who was only six years old when his family moved to the United States. “My dad was instrumental in giving me the work ethic where you do whatever you can do for your family. That’s the kind of lesson that we try to teach our players.”
Since taking over the coaching job in 2007, Khosroshahin has led USC to four straight NCAA appearances, including its first NCAA championship in program history during his first year.
The success of Ali Khosroshahin’s teams at USC, and the USA team as well, are finally giving women’s soccer its due. It’s been a long time in coming, but with endowments like this, American women’s soccer will become a dominant world force.

Along with Colorado, USC remains one of only two Pac-12 schools to not field a softball team. It also lacks a men’s soccer program, despite clamoring from fans and the fact that nearby UCLA has won four national championships since its team was formed more than 50 years ago.
Instead, in the last two years, USC’s athletic department has announced the formation of women’s lacrosse and women’s sand volleyball.
In mid-July, the university introduced Anna Collier as the school’s first sand volleyball coach, leading a program set to begin play in the spring of 2012.
The announcement comes on the heels of the January hiring of Lindsey Munday as the school’s first women’s lacrosse coach. That program will begin play starting with the 2012-2013 season.
Though other athletic programs have faced financial challenges recently, and many have cut teams, USC now boasts 21 varsity sports.
“We’re more fiscally sound than others,” said USC Assistant Athletic Director Donna Heinel. “Other institutions, sometimes state institutions that rely a lot on kickbacks, don’t have enough money to take care of their other programs, so that’s why you see a lot of state schools cutting things.”
Balancing act
USC had been looking to expand the athletic department for years, but the decision about which programs to add raised a few eyebrows.
“I’m not surprised additions were made but I’m surprised at the sports they chose,” said Syreeta Thomas, who graduated from USC in 2003. “Why not something other Pac-12 schools have?”
USC’s options were limited, however, because of Title IX restrictions.
Title IX, which was enacted in 1972 as an amendment to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, is a gender equity law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex at schools that receive federal aid.
There are three separate ways for athletic departments to comply with Title IX requirements.  One way is for schools to provide athletic opportunities “substantially proportionate” to undergraduate enrollment.   Alternatively, institutions can demonstrate they have a history and practice of program expansion, or, lastly, that their athletic programs “fully and effectively” represent the underrepresented sex.
“You only have to comply with one of the three tests and the school can choose which one it wants to comply with,” said Valerie Bonnette, founder of Good Sports Inc., Title IX and Gender Equity Specialists. “In heavily populated parts of the country, like California, schools have to add an awful lot of women’s teams because there’s a lot of interest and available competition for teams the school’s not currently offering. So, for schools in this situation, they might choose proportionality as their method for compliance.”
To remain in compliance and continue to receive federal aid, USC’s athletic scholarship offerings must mirror the university’s enrollment numbers.
In 2010-2011, 55 percent of the incoming class was female. Because of this, USC must offer more athletic scholarships for women. As a result, in seeking to expand, USC’s hands were tied — men’s soccer or men’s lacrosse simply weren’t options.
“If we were to add, say men’s lacrosse, which currently has 12.6 scholarships, the money that would be spent toward men’s scholarships would not reflect the percentages of participation and moneys,” Heinel said. “We would then probably have to add another women’s sport in order to balance that out.”
The choice to add women’s lacrosse was spurred by President C. L. Max Nikias and Provost Elizabeth Garrett, who each wanted to see USC partake in the popular east coast sport. The creation of a sand volleyball program stemmed from USC administrators’ desire to add a sport featured on the NCAA’s list of emerging sports for women.
The list, which is managed by the NCAA Committee on Women’s Athletics, is intended to help schools provide more athletic opportunities, like scholarships, for women.
The list also includes sports such as equestrian and rugby, but Heinel said sand volleyball was the first sport that made sense for USC.
“Sand volleyball [worked] because of the circuit that was around it with the [Association of Volleyball Professionals] and the popularity of it,” she said.
Unfair?
In response to the university’s recent addition of two women’s sports, some have expressed discontent with the constraints placed upon the program by Title IX.
“It’s certainly unfair and it’s because [universities] decide to let a quota law dictate athletic policy,” said Leo Kocher, president of the American Sports Council, an organization exploring Title IX reform. “These kind of twisted decisions are all the result of trying to comply with the enormous pressure these types of laws exert on athletic programs.”
Softball, a sport some hope to see at USC, could have been an option, but Heinel said the lack of facilities made women’s lacrosse a preferable choice. Women’s lacrosse will use McAlister Field, which is used by the women’s soccer team in the fall.
“Any time we look at adding sports, what is our limitations in terms of facilities?,” Heinel said. “So what we had available as far as facilities is our women’s soccer field, so we needed a spring sport that could be played on a field that we wouldn’t have to build something new. Lacrosse fit that.”
It is not money but strict gender quotas from the female only law Title IX, that forces schools to have “proportionality” when it comes to sports. Its just another disgusting anti male law which has ruined mens sports programs at the college level and thanks to feminists is now working its way into high school sports programs as well.
It’s not the money but all about the gender quota.  Alumni, parents and students should express outrage to their elected federal officials that policy decisions regarding athletic offerings are being dictated by a federal enforcement policy and that a law that was enacted to curb gender discrimination is doing quite the opposite by discriminating against males.
John, it’s money.  Football and Men’s Basketball have to make A LOT of money to cover these other sports.
How is it that a school like Stanford, with half of our total student population, offers 50% more ncaa sports than we do?
Is it just money?

If you tried wrapping your head around USC’s football team this season, chances are you’d find yourself wanting to know more.
Because of the ever-vigilant eye of the sports media and its constant barrage of prediction and analysis, it’s become a real challenge for a program of USC’s stature to sneak up on anyone. Still, this year’s squad possesses an enigmatic quality that’s hard to place.
It’s not that the coverage isn’t there, for plenty of outlets continue to scrutinize the Trojan program on a daily basis. It’s not that coaches and players are being exceptionally cryptic or reserved or coy in their interviews. It seems more that there’s just less to know right now.
Here’s what we do know: USC is irrelevantly ranked No. 25 in the preseason Associated Press poll. Junior quarterback Matt Barkley will return and will play well, likely making a splash in the Heisman race. And Tom Brady is jealous of this season’s receiving corps. That’s about it.
If you read the preliminary depth chart aloud, the number of times you heard “or” might lead you to believe you were glancing over the crew team’s inventory.
We don’t know which tailback is going to find a way to distinguish himself from the rest. Will it be sophomore Dillon Baxter? Redshirt freshman D.J. Morgan? Junior Curtis McNeal? Freshman Amir Carlisle? USC coach Lane Kiffin probably couldn’t even guess.
Will redshirt freshman Xavier Grimble or another tight end develop a connection as Barkley’s comfort target, a role Anthony McCoy shaped so well in 2009?
What constitutes Monte Kiffin’s simplified defense? Will USC be able to apply it to any level of success on that side of the ball?
Then, of course, there are the motivation questions. Can USC figure out how to cope in its second year of bowl ineligibility? Can Kiffin start to carve a legacy like his predecessor?
The sheer number of questions left unanswered to this point can be troubling with the opener against Minnesota just two short days away. This obscurity suggests a level of unpreparedness that could render the Trojans sorely regretful Saturday night. A loss to Minnesota seems implausible, but if USC isn’t ready, a 0-1 start is far from out of the question.
“I would be blown away if this team is overconfident: number one, because we’re not very good, and number two, because [Minnesota] is very, very well-coached and has a dynamic playmaker touching the ball every snap,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said after Wednesday’s practice.
That said, it’s premature to necessarily associate indecision with disarray.
With little at stake this season, it’s understandable for Kiffin to wait as long as he can before playing his hand, giving everyone on the depth chart a shot to blow him away. And the last thing he needs is the intricacies of his pop’s defensive modifications getting out to opponents.
Really, staying off the radar and providing critics with so little fodder to craft narratives and sketch out the season is an advantage. Expectations can be a healthy burden on a team. Eschewing them as much as possible allows these guys to go out and play and not concern themselves with how they stack up.
Then there’s the strategic leg up.
You can place your bets now that Minnesota coach Jerry Kill lacks even the faintest idea of who will be lining up at the bottom of USC’s I-formation Saturday afternoon, or at receiver, guard, tackle, center or a handful of other positions.
Minnesota’s already an enormous underdog coming into the Coliseum this weekend, and now it has to gameplan for about seven billion lineups? There’s no relief in facing an opponent that has so many options and so much left to reveal.
One of the great aspects of Oregon’s stellar season last year was that the team crept up on everyone, both on and off the field. The Duck’s 72-0 shellacking of New Mexico in the opener last season was an eye-opening statement of authority that the Ducks were going to, well, make a splash. Yes, they were already ranked No. 11 at the time, but few saw that uptempo game rushing them all the way into the national championship game.
USC’s team this year is no 2010 Oregon — in part because its offense isn’t so hectic but also because the Trojans have no championship to play for. Still, that model of taking teams by surprise is worth emulating. USC has a rare chance this year to evade the microscope that comes as a packaged deal with the program’s prestige, and the team would do right to take advantage of it.
The lack of information about this team is puzzling, especially to fans.
But that indefinable quality? That’s not going to hurt the team one bit.

Young lad,
You are not a bad aspiring journalist! You are a bit too wordy and esoteric to be writing for the masses and need not show off your three dollar words!  I am confident your Jounalism Professors will tell youth same! Keep it mainstream you are not trying to impress your peers as much as the litany of football fans out there.  Keep up the good work you have a lot of upside potential!  Use Pedro Moura as a template.  His work is always mainstream and appeals to the pedestrian fan!  
A fan!

With No. 25 USC’s season opener less than 72 hours away, senior tight end Rhett Ellison is ready.
“We’re in a good mindset right now,” Ellision said after Wednesday’s early morning practice. “We played really well today, so hopefully it translates to Saturday.”
Heisman hopeful · The Pac-12 is ripe for a Heisman Trophy winner in its first year of existence. Junior quarterback Matt Barkley, along with Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck and Oregon running back LaMichael James, are favorites to take home the hardware. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Ellison will be a primary check down target for junior quarterback Matt Barkley, for whom USC coach Lane Kiffin has big expectations after the third-year signal caller tossed 26 touchdown passes last season.
“[Barkley] needs to play extremely well, manage the offense, [make] very few mistakes and really put us in a position to win again and again,” Kiffin said. “He did that a number of times last year, but there were some up and down times, so now we’re looking for that consistency.”
Some of those down times included a late-season dropoff, largely because of a sprained left ankle sustained in a Nov. 20 game at Oregon State. The Trojans would eventually fall to Beavers 36-7, and without Barkley under center a week later against Notre Dame, the Trojans also fell to the Irish 20-16.
Though the Trojans’ week one opponent Minnesota won three games during the 2010 season, neither Ellison nor Kiffin is looking past the unranked Golden Gophers.
“They’re a great team,” Ellison said. “They’ve got great coaches and they have had success wherever they’re at. I don’t expect anything less from them.”
After then-coach Tim Brewster was fired midway through the 2010 season, Minnesota replaced the often-maligned Brewster with former Northern Illinois coach Jerry Kill, who led the Huskies to 23 wins in three seasons.
“They’re coached extremely well and they know what they’re doing,” Kiffin said. “I don’t expect any surprises.”
—
The Trojan defense was unquestionably a liability last season — ranking 63rd in points allowed and 93rd in yards allowed. Kiffin, however, remained uncertain what he’ll see come Saturday.
“I think it’s an unknown,” Kiffin said. “We feel better, but I felt good going into last year, too. The truth will be on Saturday and how well we tackle and how well we play. There are a lot of unknowns going into this game. We’ve got a lot to prove, a lot of places to improve.”
Though Kiffin might be skeptical, Barkley, who was recently named one of the team’s four captains, is not.
“They’re savvy, especially the secondary. There are a lot of leaders on this defense,” Barkley said. “I’m excited to see them play against a different team and see how they play.”
—
One pleasant surprise for the defense has been linebacker Lamar Dawson’s play. Dawson, a freshman from Junction City, Ky., has already been given the No. 55 jersey — worn in the past by players such as Junior Seau, Willie McGinest and Keith Rivers.
“It’s so rare for a true freshman to make a significant impact. There’s not many Robert Woods stories. It doesn’t happen very often,” Kiffin said about Dawson. “In recruiting Lamar, his 3.7 GPA, team captain, everybody raved about his maturity, that’s what has allowed him to do what he has done so far.”
The team will practice again Thursday at 8:15 a.m.
BTW:  Colin Cowherd, on his show The Herd, says that SC will win, but it will be a very close game.  Prove him wrong Trojans!!!
He cosiders SC to be very young and inexperienced.  Yes, we are, but we are fighters and have excellent coaches.
Kif….  wishing you a great game and call some killers plays.  Dont be so timid in the play calling arena. That’s what they’re looking for.
SC’s coaching staff had better prepare this young team for a hard fought game.  MN is coached by a new head coach who loves to eat clock and run the ball.  Do not fall into the trap we hit when SC played VA 2 years ago.  VA will rush the QB, as they believe if they can pressure Barks, the throwing game is off, and with young inexperienced Running Backs and Receivers, they will pressure SC all day.
Though the spread is -21 in SC’s favor, they MUST BEAT THE SPREAD in order to gain any sort of credibility with the sporting world.  SC must play fast, effective and without any mercy, at all.
Bury the Gophers and lay down the dirt, uh er… Wood(s) on em.
Fight On brothers and sisters.

LA County Fair
The Los Angeles County Fair will be open during Labor Day weekend, starting this Saturday, Sept. 3.
If you’ve never been to the LA County Fair before, you won’t want to miss out on this year’s festivities. The fair has a gargantuan, jam-packed list of fun for all ages, including myriad fair attractions, competitions, grandstand concerts and shows.
Some of the highlights include: a concert by the Beach Boys on Monday, Sept. 5; Shark Encounter, one of this year’s main attractions, which includes a tantalizing discussion and exhibit about sharks; and the enthralling Aerial Arts Circus Show with Esmeralda’s Traveling Circus — for a nominal fee, spectators can become become part of the act.
Don’t forget to buy tickets. Season passes are $24.99 at Walgreens, any-day tickets are $10 at Ralph’s or you can also buy tickets on the fair’s website at www.lacountyfair.com/2011.
FYF Fest
The much anticipated indie rock music festival will return to the Los Angeles State Historic Park in Downtown this Saturday. Performers such as Explosions in the Sky, Broken Social Scene, Yacht, Death From Above 1979, Cold War Kids and many more are sure to entertain.
Though there were many kinks with the venue last year, including long lines and supplies running out, FYF and their partner, Goldenvoice, claim they’ve prepared for these complications. The event runs from 12 p.m. to 12 a.m. and tickets start at $40, a steal compared to the price to see a single artist at the Staples Center.
There’s really nothing like watching your favorite bands — or, better yet, new favorites whom you discover that day — play as the sun sets over the majestic Downtown Los Angeles skyline. Be sure to buy your tickets as soon as possible; this is one event you won’t want to miss.
Annenberg Community Beach House
Looking for something to do during the long weekend?
The Annenberg Community Beach House, recently opened to the public, is the perfect outing for a day trip. Originally developed by William Randolph Hearst for the beautiful Marion Davies, the beach house now serves as a temporary getaway for all — no exclusive membership required.
The beach house has incredible, picturesque views, a splash pad, a play area for children, art galleries, a historic pool and a splendid guest house that used to belong to Davies.  Aside from the various highlights to look at, Annenberg Beach House also has a slew of intriguing activities for people to get involved in, including everything from yoga and disc golf to ladder ball and stand-up paddleboarding.
The best part about the Annenberg Community Beach House is its low prices. There will be free tours Monday, and prices for using the facility are $4 per hour or $10 for the day. For more information on the beach house’s location, hours and activities, visit its website at www.annenbergbeachhouse.com.
Hollywood Forever Cemetery Screenings
This weekend, the Cinespia screenings at the infamous Hollywood Forever Cemetery feature two cult favorites — Tim Burton’s 1990 classic Edward Scissorhands and Rob Reiner’s 1984 rockumentary This Is Spinal Tap. Cinespia is notorious for playing old Hollywood or cult-classic works, but they’ve outdone themselves with this glorious double feature weekend.
Typically, screenings only run every Saturday throughout the summer, but then again nothing says Labor Day weekend better than Johnny Depp as a dark, yet endearing and lovable scissor-handed man, or a group of dumbstruck Brits singing around a miniature Stonehenge and dancing elf. The cemetery is located off of Santa Monica Boulevard and Gower Street.
Tickets are $10 at the door, though you should look into online ticketing given last week’s screening of Hitchcock’s Psycho was sold out by the time most attendees arrived. Bring a picnic and blanket and snuggle up to some of Hollywood’s best at this interesting, prime location.

There’s nothing like USC on game day.
The first time you stare out into the sea of cardinal and gold, you might get a little nervous. Thousands upon thousands of ardent fans revel in the excitement of being members of the Trojan Family. The music is loud, the food is hot, the drinks are cool and the band can inspire even the most pessimistic Debbie Downer — and this isn’t even the game.
Rendezvous point · Game days can be some of the most hectic times around campus; utilize your surroundings and pick out iconic reference points, like Tommy Trojan, to meet up with friends and family. - Victoria Gu | Daily Trojan
Tailgating has become one of USC’s greatest traditions. There’s nothing like opening up your dorm window to the smell of grilled hamburgers and the sound of reggaeton music blasting from the quad.
Those who have never experienced a USC tailgate will probably think it’s an exaggeration to say that it’s one of the most massive and exciting events someone could ever attend. If you’ve never gone, just wait until the first game this Saturday.
It might seem impossible, but USC’s tailgates do have a bit of a downside. Because game day festivities are so extraordinary, there is a lot of planning required, especially if you want to get the full USC football experience.
Location
If you decide to throw your own tailgate party, location is key. People typically get to campus at 8 a.m. to secure a spot. The ideal spot is underneath the Traveler statue; that way, you can see all the way down Trousdale Parkway, which is great for people watching, while also being close enough to beat the rush of football hooligans squirming to get to the Coliseum.
Another good spot is next to Tommy Trojan. People tend to get lost walking around in the crowds, so when you say, “I’m over by Tommy Trojan,” your rendezvous becomes a lot easier.
The marching band also performs going down Trousdale — definitely a sight to see. Don’t miss this spectacle; set up close by.
Lastly, stay away from McCarthy Quad. It’s mostly for alumni and older folks, and students tend to stick closer to Trousdale.
Dress Wisely
Though it goes without saying, don’t wear our opponent’s colors — or anything that slightly resembles them — even if your parents, grandparents or cousins went to the opposing school. You will most assuredly get heckled.
Keep it USC-friendly with cardinal, gold and black. Face paint, cardinal and gold Mardi Gras beads and other ’SC-themed accessories are encouraged. If you look in the mirror and think you look like an explosion of cardinal and gold, you’re wearing the right thing, and if you ever feel embarrassed, remember the Trojan Knights are in the front row with their entire bodies painted.
Tradition
Though decking yourself out in cardinal and gold is imperative, don’t forget to kick the flag posts on Trousdale on your way to the Coliseum. Doing so, of course, is a time-honored tradition.
Though it could be classified as a natural disaster, heading to the bookstore on game day is always fun and something everyone tries at least once. There, you can pick up some last-minute necessities while trying not to be suffocated by the herds of people.
Try to get a good seat in the Trojan Nation section for at least one game. Trust me, it’s a different experience watching the game from behind the goal post than from the top of the bleachers. Sure, you have to get there a little early, but it’s worth it.
Before the game, try to learn as many of our songs and chants as you can. Game day staples include the “Fight On” symbol and the words to our Alma Mater
Have Fun
The point of tailgating is to have fun, but you don’t want to have so much fun that you can’t enjoy — or remember — the game. You don’t want to be the attendee that gets too drunk to go to the Coliseum, or worse, the attendee that makes it there but is a disgraceful, sloppy mess.
Gather a bunch of friends to walk over together. It’s a great way to make new friends when you’re a freshman, a transfer student or someone who just wants to meet new people.
Tailgating only happens in the fall, so enjoy it while you can. Before you know it, it will be spring and Saturdays just become Saturdays. Wear all of the cardinal and gold that you can and participate in our “UCLA sucks” chants. USC football games are truly unique experiences, so don’t forget to soak them up while they last.
SPREAD THE WORD:  Unless we’re playing UCLA, chant “NCAA sucks” during Tusk this year.  Those Bruins aren’t even worth our timen anymore, but the NCAA is pure evil.

It’s only the second week of school and you’re already running out of your new, back-to-school clothes. You can’t run the risk of wearing the same clothes from week to week — major fashion faux pas. So, what are you to do?
Look for discounts and shop on a college budget, of course. That’s where Target and Macy’s step in. With designer names but inexpensive prices, you’ll be looking great without breaking the bank. Good luck trying to fit your fat wallet into those brand new skinny jeans.
Big Name Designers at Target
Rumors have been swirling for some time about the Missoni lifestyle collection to be released exclusively for the budget retailer. At its core, Missoni is a family-based clothing home goods brand most identifiable by its eye-catching zigzag motifs and quality knits.
On Sept. 13, Target will launch an exclusive capsule collection created by the Missonis themselves and modeled by Margherita Missoni, the young heiress to the fashion house’s fortune. The Target campaign reflects many of the ideals applied in their higher-end advertisements, but this one carries a younger appeal, making Missoni’s chic clothing available to students and money conscious consumers.
This idea is far from original. Missoni joins the likes of Proenza Schouler, Alice Temperley and Zac Posen, a few of the many designers who have brought their collections to Target — for only a brief period of time only. Few, however, have had collections as expansive as the upcoming Missoni collection, which will include everything from bicycles to blankets.
The hype surrounding the collaboration should come as no surprise to fashion followers. Missoni and Target bring together everything the American shopper values: brand recognition, elegance and, of course, a good deal.
At price points between $16 and $69.99, the Missoni capsule collection is sure to be a knockout. What better way to add some designer envy — without breaking the college budget — than throwing on a colorful zigzag scarf?
Luxury Brands at Macy’s 
Target is not the only retailer to join forces with high-end designers. After this summer’s collaboration with Matthew Williamson, Macy’s has decided to team up with the market savvy Karl Lagerfeld. The designer primarily known as the mastermind behind Chanel is also grabbing the wallet-friendly market with his own collection for Macy’s in stores now.
In a release, Lagerfeld said, “To me, Macy’s is the perfect department store in the U.S. where everybody can find what they’re looking for without ruining their budget.” If the frugal shopper is looking for classic tailored pieces, high necklines and flowy dresses, they should look no further than their local department store.
To add more fuel to its fashion fire, Macy’s also announced that it has Italian designer Giambattista Valli lined up to follow Lagerfeld with a collaborative project. This line is meant to appeal to “fierce fashionistas,” according to the fashion trade journal, Women’s Wear Daily. If the line falls in accordance with Valli’s usual aesthetic, the embellished skirts and dresses will make for perfect party wear for our school’s dressier occasions. The average Macy’s shopper might not be familiar with Valli, but for the tuned-in, this collection will be a fashion gold mine. USC students are known to have their eyes on trends, and with the campus’ close proximity to the Macy’s Downtown location, we have all the more reason to be excited.
Though it might not be the wisest idea to set up a tent the night before the collections are released, it might be necessary to wait online or hurry to the stores the morning of the launch. Retailers continually make the most coveted collections scarce while hyping the product up as if it were a revelation, sending buyers on a shopping frenzy, even if it is just to resell the product on eBay. So here’s to betting the system will work — even if the merchandise is a $50 T-shirt emblazoned with Mr. Lagerfeld’s face.

As part of a performance piece in the early ’70s, Yugoslavian-born Marina Abramovic lied in the outline of a burning star until she lost consciousness.
Performer · Abramovic has stunned the art world with performance pieces like “The Artist is Present,” a piece where she sits and stares at her own fans. - Deborah Ho | Daily Trojan
Abramovic’s Museum of Modern Art 2010 exhibition “The Artist is Present” had her spending three months in the museum. She sat in a chair with an empty one across from her, which was open to any attendee to sit and stare back at her for as long as they wished.
Abramovic’s revolutionary work has continued to influence both the art world and the mainstream world in general.
For USC artists and art lovers, simply creating or looking at a two-dimensional piece is sometimes not enough. This is where performance art comes in. And although performance art started back in the 1960s and 1970s, its presence is still felt and its history is still important to young artists today.
In this canvas-less medium, artists create a performance that challenges onlookers to interact with them.
The idea of going to a museum to look at art might seem stifling and intimidating, but artists can break through this preconception with performance art. One of the best-known performance art pieces is Yoko Ono’s “Cut Piece,” in which she allowed audience members to come up to her and cut away at her clothes. Performance artists are unique in that they willingly take the risk of exposing themselves to audiences.
A momentous figure in that vein, Abramovic has broken boundaries and made it easier for new artists today to push their ideas to new heights. Her work over the decades has shown that this medium can reach out to different generations and still continue to challenge and shock viewers.
And now, Abramovic wants to leave behind a lasting impression on the art world by creating a new center in Montenegro that gives artists a space to create and showcase their own performance art.
The building is yet another one of Abramovic’s attempts to make performance art accessible and exciting to both new artists and art lovers. Even though the new center will give artists a new resource, it is, in reality, less likely to have a huge effect compared to what other similar artists have already created.
Most students at Roski will probably attest that their work is a product of their own thinking and not so much a communal product. And though a space is beneficial to any budding artist, Abramovic and her contemporaries’ past performances are what really serve as inspiration for the next great ideas.
Abramovic is aware of this, stating, “When you die, the only thing you can leave behind is a good idea.” If this rings true, a distinct place to have performance art is not necessary because Abramovic’s works themselves will spark ideas that will lead to great pieces.
Even if you haven’t heard of her before, Abramovic’s work has made it possible for everyone from famous to up-and-coming artists to go beyond conventional art. Performance art can serve as inspiration for a variety of arts, from theater to music. For any musician, artist or actor, it is essential to create something that will garner attention and keep the audience intrigued and captivated.
Though Abramovic’s plans for the new space give a huge nod of encouragement to new artists, the true inspiration lies in her work. Whether you are a serious art student or a reluctant art lover, Abramovic’s daring works showcase an attitude that goes beyond any specific location. Just looking back on her works and those of others similar to her can create inspiration for any artist, regardless of his or her craft.

All wars, however brief, are brutal; not surprisingly, this principle held true in the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia.
Bellicose defects · Despite quality shots, other aspects — a weak soundtrack and awkward acting moments — of 5 Days of War keep the film from reaching its full potential as a dramatic wartime story. - Photo courtesy of Ginsberg Libby PR
As the summer Olympics in Beijing, China were underway, Russia, nominally in support of two breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, invaded neighboring Georgia, previously a part of the Soviet Union. After five days of conflict, hundreds were dead and more than 150,000 were displaced. And now, under the helm of director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger), the war gets the Hollywood treatment in 5 Days of War.
A year after losing his girlfriend in Iraq, reporter Thomas Anders (Rupert Friend) enlists his partner in journalism Sebastian Ganz (Richard Coyle) to go to Georgia, mere days before the war. When the bombing starts, they rescue Tatia (Emmanuelle Chriqui), who agrees to be their translator in exchange for their help in finding her family.
From the first scene, it is clear the cast is the highlight of the film. Friend’s performance mixes the excitement of seeing a conflict with an emotional distance brought on because of his losses. As Ganz, Coyle is a snarky compatriot to the withdrawn lead, and the pair’s scenes together crackle with wit. It’s one of the best depictions of journalists in the field on film.
The supporting cast is also admirable. Chriqui finds a delicate balance between overwhelming emotion and determination. In his small but important scenes near the end, Rade Serbedzija gives a frighteningly subdued performance as the leader of a South Ossetian militia.
The film’s best scene comes as he and Anders sit down over a game of chess to exchange world views. The idea of two men on different sides swapping philosophy is an overplayed trope in cinema, but thanks to great chemistry between Serbedzija and Friend, it is a fascinating and suspenseful moment.
Andy Garcia is also compelling as the beleaguered Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili. Stuck with few options and almost no outside support, Saakashvili is torn between trying to prevent a larger conflict and protecting his people. In character, Garcia sells every bit of it. The only downside is that he feels disconnected from the main narrative of Anders and Ganz.
And that is where the film trips up. The plot operates on two levels, telling the journalists’ perspectives as they both try to flee to safety and report the war while covering Saakashvili’s attempts to avoid war. The latter is needed to provide the exposition to the drama of the former, but while one is a character based survival-thriller, the other’s clean, office-based scenes feel too disconnected.
At the same time, the well-written dramatic moments are interspersed with a number of scenes that feel forced and clichéd, from last-minute rescues to crucial moments that are emphasized to the point of ruining the desired effect.
The film, however, does benefit from impressive cinematography. Checco Varese, director of photography, using RED Digital Cinema cameras — the same high-definition system used in District 9 — and made almost every shot count. Filmed on location in Georgia, 5 Days of War is full of rich scenery, as well as detailed, gritty moments of combat.
Varese and Harlin avoid oversaturating the film, barring the introductory scene in Tbilisi, with beautiful shots simply for the sake of their beauty. The visuals enhance, but never hinder the storytelling.
The film’s biggest fault, however, lies in its stylistic approach. For half of the film — including the intense opening segment in Iraq — Harlin takes on a very naturalistic style devoid of fancy scores, camera tricks or clichés. It fits both the subject matter and the main characters.
Unfortunately, the other half embraces all of those tropes. Dramatic scenes are slowed down, given an overpowering musical accompaniment and thereby stripped of the drama the situation and the actors bring to those moments. Even the establishing shots of Tbilisi, visually brilliant, are marred by an extremely out of place techno track.
It is not to say that 5 Days of War is a film using a real tragedy as a backdrop for Hollywood melodrama or action. Instead, it seems committed to telling the story of the war, but unsure as to how. At the helm is Harlin, unable to let the powerful moments stand on their own.
In the end, it’s a flawed film, a powerful cast and a compelling topic weighed down by the production they are attached to.
It was Georgia attacked South Ossetia. Look EU Report, the war started by Georgia. Georgian propoganda works well.

Billboard, a music industry company known for its Hot 100 and weekly magazine, has recently added a new chart to its catalogue. Joining the Hot 200, which tracks the best-selling albums of the week and the celebrity popularity meter the Social 50, is the K-Pop Hot 100.
The K-Pop chart was created with the help of Billboard Korea, but U.S. representatives believe it has big potential.
“We’re excited to be expanding Billboard’s globally recognized Hot 100 chart franchise into this country, and look forward to enhancing the the K-Pop Hot 100 chart in the near future with additional data as well as creating new charts that showcase the breadth of Korean music,” said Billboard’s Director of Charts Silvio Pietroluongo on the company’s website.
But what does Billboard’s expansion to Korea really mean? Scrutiny of the first No. 1 single on the chart, Sistar’s “So Cool,” reveals Korean music will simply be further Americanized through the process of integrating into Billboard’s single-based music strategy.
Production in the song features the dance-hall synths that both Pitbull and LMFAO have been exploiting lately, and the chorus in “So Cool” is in English, while the remaining versus are sung in Korean. The music video for the song plays like a less gritty TLC clip with a splash of Disneyesque pop star dance moves. If the song were on mute, one would have trouble thinking it anything but the creation of an American record label.
The catchiness of the top five tracks on the K-Pop Hot 100 is undeniable, and the production of their sister videos is as flashy as the lights of Seoul. Nothing groundbreaking musically is coming out of these songs, but they do sell well.
Billboard’s international outlook is a smart business venture, one that we’d all be wise to keep an eye out for.

Oscar-nominated actor James Franco has gotten cold feet about making his Broadway debut this fall. The 33-year celebrity old was slated to star opposite Oscar winner Nicole Kidman in the revival of the 1959 Tennessee Williams play, Sweet Bird of Youth. The play tells the story of a drifter using an aging actress to get into movies.
David Cromer is directing the play, with Scott Rudin at the helm of the production team. Kidman is said to be still involved in the play, though no replacement for Franco has been announced yet.
However, in an interview with The New York Times, the director stated that he is not very sure if the play will go ahead this fall itself as it is still very much on the drawing board. Mr. Rudin is currently busy with another revival, Death of a Salesman, directed by Mike Nichols and starring Philip Seymour Hoffman, Linda Emond and Andrew Garfield.
Earlier this year, James Franco had co-hosted the Oscars with Anne Hathaway. He was also one of the nominees for the Academy Award for the Best Performance in a Leading Role for work in 127 Hours. His latest project, sci-fi hit Rise of the Planet of the Apes, has further enhanced his reputation. The actor has two full feature films  — Sal and Maladies — lined up for a release later this year.
Franco had initially garnered attention for his performances in the TV show Freaks and Geeks (1999) and straight-for-television movie James Dean (2001). Since then he has portrayed Harry Osbourne, one of Peter Parker’s friends, in the Spider-Man franchise and was cast by Robert de Niro to play the former’s son in City by the Sea (2002).

Greater student support of athletic programs is key
Why is it that the Daily Trojan is so obsessed with the “death” of USC football? Every week it seems a writer takes a shot with an article about “how bad the team is” or how “it will never be as good as it was before.” Rather than recognize that the university has long ignored its “other” sports and athletes and is now giving them all their rightful place alongside its football team, the Daily Trojan takes the stand that the athletic department is trying to divert our attention away from our now “failing” football program by using our Olympic athletes as a smoke screen.
If you want to talk about respect for what our athletes do and have done, why not start by looking in the mirror? When the Daily Trojan chooses to say that the athletic department’s campaign to acknowledge and honor USC’s rich tradition of Olympic success is just another way to take attention away from a potentially bad football season, this takes a shot at a football team that has yet to play a single game this season.
It takes away everything that our Olympians have accomplished in their respective sports and events. USC’s Olympic athletes have represented their respective countries beyond anything that a football player can do.
Not to take anything away from one amazing group of athletes, but when you are an Olympian, you represent an entire country and not just a single school.
If you ask me, the campaign to honor our Olympic athletes is long overdue, and I — in spite of my obsessive loyalty to our football team — support it wholeheartedly. Perhaps this is the attitude that is missing on our campus. So many students are looking to get behind the latest thing. It is a generational thing, I guess.
To me, the issue is not about the athletic department sending out emails about buying football tickets, it is about the fact that many of our students could really care less about anything bigger or other than themselves. Yes, there was a time when tickets to football games were hard to come by, and ’SC students, alumni and fans alike lived and died by what the Trojans did on Saturdays — those times were called the ’70s.
Today’s “fans,” if you can even call them that, are more interested in tailgating than in touchdowns. You want to know where all the missing students are on game days? Look on campus or on the front lawns of the houses on The Row.
If you really want to increase and improve the support for our football team, then you have to acknowledge that we must do the same for all of our teams. How about focusing on articles that showcase the positive aspects of our athletic programs and the potential accomplishments of our teams and individual athletes?
Let’s start a student-led campaign to pledge our support for all sports, starting with one of our most important. Let’s create a rallying cry — something to bring out both our students’ anger and optimism.
If we refer to this university as the Trojan Family, then don’t you think there is something wrong with only cheering for one child when she competes and ignoring the other when he competes? What about taking the stand that one child’s championship is just a parent’s way of covering up for another child’s subpar season?

You didn’t eat enough fruits or vegetables today. Chances are, you didn’t eat any at all.
OK, that’s kind of an unfair accusation. Still, research shows that it isn’t unfounded. According to an Oregon State University study released last month, college men tend to eat five servings of the good stuff per week, while college women tend to eat only four servings.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
But this lack of fruit and vegetable consumption is not the fault of any university — it’s the fault of the students.
It makes sense that college students don’t make their eating habits a priority. Juggling classes, jobs and extracurriculars is no joke; the task is made even harder by the fact that, in most cases, students are dealing with their first four years away from home.
With little prior experience in the realm of chores and cooking, many students succumb to ramen and fast food.
These are not justifications.  But they’re excuses — excuses the Internet has made obsolete.
Some students maintain they can’t eat well because they’re hopeless in the kitchen. To avoid burning the kitchen down, look no further than YouTube. The leading source of stupid animal videos also happens to be full of cooking demonstrations. These clips are often better than live demonstrations, as they can be paused, rewound and played over and over again.
More importantly, the videos don’t just come from chefs: They come from ordinary people. These are people who didn’t learn how to julienne carrots in a classroom. Coincidentally, “how to julienne carrots” on YouTube has about 234 results, “how to grill chicken” produced about 3,620 results and “how to boil pasta” produced about 5,370 results. You get the picture.
Students can run away from the kitchen with excuses, but they can’t escape the Internet.
Never before have students had access to such a variety of food-related knowledge. In the past, people relied on cookbooks, but the average college student doesn’t need another book to read.
The emergence of the blogosphere, however, changed matters dramatically. Now, there’s an entire world full of ordinary people who don’t have time to cook, who scrounge for food money, who use leftover beer in their recipes, whatever. Best of all, these people share ways to cook with these constraints in mind.
“A Year of Slow Cooking” is a blog written by Stephanie O’Dea. She’s a mother and not a student, but her tips are still helpful. The recipes on her blog range from easy and cheap to borderline fancy; she has something for every occasion.
What’s more, she does a fantastic job of describing the idiosyncrasies of slow cooking, allowing readers to eventually create their own recipes.
The Crock-Pot is one of the most low-maintenance cooking devices out there. Usually, making a meal with a Crock-Pot involves no more than dumping ingredients in the pot, plugging it in, choosing one of two temperatures and leaving the kitchen. The Crock-Pot can do its thing while you’re in class or asleep (or asleep in class). Its useful nature, along with convenience, is yet another way for students to avoid the laziness that comes along with cooking and eating healthy.
Admittedly, O’Dea’s recipes often have many ingredients. Luckily, students who don’t like grocery shopping can look to “College Cuisine.”
You can already tell that it’s geared toward college students, as the writer uses Tumblr. The personal blurb is also telling: “I don’t always have ingredients like Gruyere or heavy cream on hand (nor do I have the budget for them) but I can still whip up some tasty treats.” The writer makes simple meals that are sometimes portable and he has a bucket list of Los Angeles food.
No one’s going to cook every meal they eat. Some weeks, people really, truly don’t have time. Nonetheless, taking advantage of the Internet’s jaw-dropping resources should make those weeks about as rare as beef tartar.

Thank you, Maya for your article!  I’m the registered dietitian at the Student Health Center and I think it’s great that you reminded us that  “ordinary people” can cook well enough to take care of themselves.  Really apreciate the comments about the slow cooker – meals take a little planning up front but it’s definitely worth it.

Last semester several notable events put in motion a series of disciplinary actions taken against the USC social scene, ultimately culminating in The Row being placed on social probation.
Shari Hawker | Daily Trojan
In addition to this official sentence, the university continues to enforce significantly stricter policies than in years’ past regarding partying and drinking. The Dept. of Public Safety shuts down anything reminiscent of a party and the university recently reminded Greeks that parties are allowed only from Friday at 3 p.m. to Sunday at 5 p.m. even if the probation that was enacted last semester is lifted.
Last year’s events, and the subsequent disciplinary action taken by the university, received a lot of media attention, ranging from Jezebel.com, a site in the Gawker media network, to the Huffington Post. Though the policies handed down by the university might minimize the risk of drinking-related hazards, putting the spotlight on this aspect of USC only generates unnecessary negative attention toward the university, which, in turn, detracts from USC’s appeal as a respected university.
With an incredibly diverse student body, expansive array of courses of study, hundreds of organizations and clubs, prominent alumni network and highly ranked academics, it is not hard to see why USC is one of the most sought-after colleges in the nation.
But what really sets USC apart from the crowd is its students’ ability to balance thriving academic careers with equally thriving social lives. Essentially, USC is known as a place to learn and be challenged academically while also having a “typical” college experience. In return, USC students achieve success and form an accomplished, involved and illustrious alumni network because of this well-rounded education, which includes social and life skills in addition to a premier academic experience.
USC alumni do not achieve success simply because they are smart; rather, they achieve success because they are intelligent, outgoing, confident and socially adept.
With the recent social sanctions, however,  many members of the Greek community are feeling increasingly resentful toward the administration — a sentiment that would inevitably be felt by any prospective students visiting or inquiring about the university.
Furthermore, not only do the strict policies foster skepticism among prospective students, but they also promote pent-up resentment among current students that ultimately could backfire, resulting in irresponsible behavior once students are allowed to go to The Row.
Is the university attempting to erase any party culture from future generations of USC students? If so, these efforts are, for the most part, in vain. If or when the social moratorium is lifted all of these bottled up desires might come out in full force, leading to a scene perhaps even worse than last year’s “Black Monday.”
College students like to have fun, and for many this includes drinking. Regardless of how many parties DPS shuts down or how many sanctions are imposed on The Row, students who want to drink and party will find a way to do so — regardless of probations. And the vast majority of these students will do so safely and responsibly.
Admissions to the university are becoming more and more competitive, directly correlating to an increasingly intelligent student body. The academic achievements of the student body more than merit a little more social freedom.
 
Laura Burdine is a junior majoring in print and digital journalism. She is also a member of the Delta Gamma sorority. 
Drinking has been around for young adults.and college campus’  forever.  This is nothing new.  I’m a parent to a Greek, I’m an alum, from the ’80’s who was in a sorority and I’m a current supporter of USC.   When I lived on the row, we drank mostly on Thursday nights and Saturday football days/nights….mostly beer and mixed drinks.  Now (or before sanctions) it seems like every day is a party day,  and it seems like everyone drinks shots or handles to get trashed.  My personal opinion is this culture of drinking straight alcohol is stupid.  I’ll do a shot from time to time.  But there’s no good to me from doing more than one in a night.  I don’t drink to puke or black out…I drink to loosen up.  it’s much more fun!  With that all said…no,  I don’t think good will come from shutting down the fun on the row.  But when 8 people in one night get taken to the hospital for alcohol poisoning, there’s a problem and unless the Greek community can take it down a notch, I can see why administration needs to take it up before someone dies.
I think the ban has created a little more respect for USC rules and regulations and it appears The Row has become a much more pleasant place for everyone.
Perhaps the University wouldn’t have felt compelled to act as it did had the students been able to demonstrate an understanding of the difference between social leniency and social responsibility.
Row parties are not the only source of social interaction at USC.  Find another outlet.  If you are unable to become a well-rounded person without attending fraternity parties, you weren’t close to being well-rounded in the first place.
In addition, your argument that current Greek sanctions are creating bad publicity for USC is erroneous.  Aside from the Daily Trojan, no one else thinks the sanctions are newsworthy.  It was the behavior that led to the sanctions that brought negative attention to USC.
Your argument that the “pent-up resentment” and “bottled up desires” of resentful students could lead to a night of apocalyptic party behavior once the sanction is lifted is a great argument not to lift the sanction.
If the Row ever stops hanging itself with whatever rope USC gives it, perhaps it can be given sufficient freedom to enjoy itself.  Unfortunately, the Row’s behavior has resulted in tarnishing the name of the University and its students and alumni.
Great perspective Laura. I agree that the current administration seem biased against the Row and in the long run, this will not prove to be a good decision – college kids drink and socialize and party and the more they are restricted, the more they will rebel.  It is not USC’s job to teach our kids how to drink responsibly – that should have been handled by their families long ago.  This is sounding a lot like “big brother” to me. Wondering how the alumni feel about these positions – especially those that were part of the Greek system and who realize the value of sister and brotherhood, both during the college years and beyond.
Very well said.  At orientation, our students were noted for being well balanced people, not just great academics.  The vast majority of the students are responsible in their social activities.  Shutting down the Row just forces the parties elsewhere, away from the protection of DPS.  I agree that the subsequent classes and touring potential Trojans will see the difference.

Five gang members have confessed to their participation in the recent casino torching attacks in Monterrey, Mexico. Last Thursday, armed men burst into Casino Royale, doused the carpet with gasoline and threw three grenades into the hall before exiting to four vehicles waiting in the parking lot. When the billowing smoke cleared and the debris unblocked from the escape routes, 52 were found dead and many more injured.
Last week, Governor Medina de la Cruz presented security footage of two vehicles that participated, in which people were taped putting gasoline into the car later involved in the casino attack. Investigators found a fingerprint on one of the cars, leading them to several suspects.
The State Agency of Investigations identified the suspects as Luis Carlos Carrazco Espinosa, 25; Javier Alonso Martinez Morales (alias “el Javo,”), 37, from Monterrey; Jonathan Jahir Reyna Gutierrez, 18; Juan Angel Leal Flores, 20; and Julio Tadeo Berrones, 28 (alias “el Julio Rayas”).
The men are members of the drug cartel gang Los Zetas and have criminal records ranging from homicide to kidnapping. They reported to the state-run Notimex News Agencythey torched the casino because the owners did not meet their extortion demands.
Monterrey, approximately 140 miles from the Texas border, is considered a wealthy community home to some of Mexico’s largest companies. In response to the attack and associated gang violence, President Barack Obama said our government will stand shoulder to shoulder with Mexico.
The governor called for witnesses to identify the remaining two assailants, offering a 30 million peso (2.4 million) reward for this information. However no other information was released about the suspects in fear of “jeopardizing the investigation.” Three days of national mourning were declared by President Felipe Calderon, in addition to a televised interview pledging the continuation of the fight against organized crime.

Though classes have barely, for theater students, much of the fall semester has already been decided. Beginning the second day of classes, the USC School of Theater commenced its week-long audition process, a period characterized by butterflies and broken hearts, tears shed and dreams come true for many of those auditioning. And in the last few days, nearly all of the shows have been cast.
Each semester, the theater school hosts a wide variety of shows, ranging from vaudeville to contemporary dramatic to slapstick and beyond. After receiving “The Great Audition Memo” in the summer informing them of the selection of plays and the audition pieces required, the theater students are let loose to audition for as many or as few as they like, usually with a monologue of their choice.
Though exciting, this process is hectic, nerve-wracking and, in many cases, ultimately ends in disappointment. Despite the wide spectrum of plays, there are too few roles to accommodate the massive crowd of exceptionally talented. audition-minded theater students.
The auditions all take place within one week, which results in a whirlwind of anticipation for students. At any given audition, which typically take place from 6 p.m. to as late as midnight, you can find handfuls of young actors gathered in the hall, headshot in hand, eagerly awaiting their brief and fleeting moment to show their talent and hope for the best. But for even the most seasoned audition veterans with years of experience under their belts, there are no guarantees.
Though not getting cast might initially result in heartbreak, there is always a silver lining. Theater students love what they do, and even if an audition does not ultimately lead to being cast in a show, it provides a hands-on learning experience and a snapshot into the competitive industry in the real world.
This positive attitude and love of the craft is what brings students back, semester after semester, to audition for each new crop of plays. Hoping for the best but braced for the worst, the students approach each audition with confidence, knowing that even if they don’t get the part, there is always another one right around the corner. Check the USC School of Theater website in the coming weeks for the full season of plays for the fall 2011 semester.

Explosions in the Sky, The Dead Milkmen, Kid Dynamite … no, these are not darkly named war headlines. These are some of the most highly anticipated acts performing at the upcoming FYF Festival at the Los Angeles State Historic Park on September 3rd.
The FYF Festival (or the F*** Yeah Festival, for scenesters) is in its eighth year of providing great  music, laugh-out-loud comedy and chill vibes for all ages. While still maintaining its reputation for jam-packed fun, The FYF Fest has indeed addressed some pressuring issues from previous years with both publicized upgrades and the addition of a new producer.
The main inconveniences last year included long wait times for admission, limited access to water and dust clouds. The FYF Festival’s management addressed these concerns on their own website, under frequently asked questions, stating they will indeed have more entrances into the festival for shorter lines and quicker access; they will now place tents throughout the venue to provide more shading, and the festival will also provide more water fountains/carts and food vendors for easier access to all patrons.
However, the most needed upgrade will be both preventing and reducing the amount of dust clouds present at the venue, “we invested in a ton of wood chips that will keep the watered down and compacted dirt from coming up into the air,” festival posted on its website. Without a doubt a cleaner, clearer and more comfortable environment will drastically improve the feel of FYF Fest. And while we are still addressing upgrades, the biggest change for The FYF Festival to date is the inclusion of a new co-producer, Goldenvoice.
As a mogul promoter, behind the success of such iconic festivals like Coachella and Stagecoach, Goldenvoice should give FYF great guidance and depth this year. As Sean Carlson, founder of the FYF music tours, noted on the festival’s main website, “This will be our first year working with Goldenvoice to produce the event. The festival started eight years ago when I was 18. Last year I moved out of father’s house and last week we moved into an office. FYF is four people at the core but it wouldn’t be possible without a solid group of people that help part time. It’s best to keep this short. We are excited.” Such a big change is always worrisome, but as Carlson put it best, they are a solid group progressing and everyone is excited to be on this ride.

The FYF Festival is September 3rd at the Los Angeles State Historic Park, and for those of you with tickets, here’s a quick look at the must-see acts of the day.
First up is Explosions in the Sky. The name barely touches upon the greatness expected from the band at this year’s FYF Festival. Featuring guitarists Munaf Rayani and Mark Smith, bassist Michael James and drummer Chris Hrasky, this post-rock group from Austin, TX, will perform fresh off recently released sixth album Take Care, Take Care, Take Care. Explosions in the Sky brings a state of momentum and musical depth that no other band on the entire lineup can as easily replicate.
As a breakout band in 2007, Explosions in the Sky described their music in an interview with NPR, ‘as a series of cathartic mini-symphonies.’ Not afraid of pacing the music and creating their own sense of time, Explosions in the Sky delivers pieces that sometimes stretch longer than 10 minutes or more ensuring an almost echoed effect of their performance. If you are attending FYF Fest and our looking for a band that not only plays their music, but really performs it, Explosions in the Sky are a must-see. They take the Donatello Stage after 10 p.m.
Next up we have Avi Buffalo, the pseudonym for Long Beach, California native Avigdor Zahner-Isenberg. Joined by the focused Sheridan Riley on drums, the Avi Buffalo duo is slated to get all festival-goers in the perfect summertime mood with their soothing alternative rock music. Although Avi Buffalo has had recent troubles with the departures of both vocalist Rebecca Coleman and Arin Fazio in 2010, they have not only held their own since, but jumped onto the radars of many music critics on their current Sub Pop music Tour.
“One Last,” a single off their debut self-titled album, sets the tone of who they are as a group. For those who like calming music but enjoy the occasional sexual metaphor set to laidback tunes, Avi Buffalo is your main headliner at FYF Fest. The band will be performing on the Raphael Stage around 1:30 p.m.
Finally, a highlight of the FYF Festival every year that sometimes goes unsung, is the comedy shows presented by The Meltdown in the main tent. This year the first showcase lineup features two comedians that are a guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. The hilarious Natasha Leggero from  E! show Chelsea Lately and the witty Joselyn Hughes from Tosh.0 on Comedy Central are the only female comical acts during the entire FYF Festival, and so should have a refreshing perspective.
If your interested in attending and have not purchased your tickets yet, check out The FYF Festival website for tickets starting at $40 for general admission and $99 for VIP access; they are all also available online through ticketweb.com, at local record stores or at the event on September 3rd.
Shari E. Hawker has certainly found a commanding way of introducing me to a new Genre of music.  Although  I am not going to be  in attendance at this concert, (I’ll be when they’re in N.Y), her explanation of this “Band ..Explosions In The Sky” has given me a clear understanding of their music, and how their transition from one vocalist to another, has not hinder their progress in anyway instead they are moving to new heights musically.. good luck to them and more “Props” to Shari E. Hawker, looking forward to more great articles like this one.

Decades of mismanagement by the Pacific Gas & Electric Company led to the San Bruno pipeline explosion  — which killed eight people last September — the federal government said Tuesday.
The National Transportation Safety Board reported PG&E failed to properly assess the risk and had installed a bad pipe in the Northern California city. The city of San Bruno was the “victim” and not one of the responsible parties in the explosion, which had also destroyed dozens of houses in the surrounding areas.
“This represents a failure of the entire system — a system of checks and balances that should have prevented this disaster,” Robert L. Sumwalt, an NTSB board member, told the Los Angeles Times. “The seam weld may have been the technical reason, but this was an organizational accident.”
The specific cause of the San Bruno accident was an electrical failure that allowed excess gas to leak into the pipeline, building up pressure and eventually leading to the explosion. But NTSB officials place more blame in PG&E’s lack of internal regulation when building the pipelines decades ago — particularly in the welding structures of the lines.
“There is scant evidence of quality control measures when the pipeline was installed,” Donald Kramer, one of the agency’s investigators, told the Times. “Either the inspections were not done or they were not done properly, and there is no evidence of testing.”
Last September, the natural gas pipeline had exploded suddenly, with the flames spreading rapidly into the neighborhood for about an hour. Residents reported initially believing the eruption was an earthquake.
A spokesman from PG&E has acknowledged the board’s findings and said the company plans to follow its recommendations.

For USC students, Labor Day weekend offers a welcome break to the busyness and early chaos that starts off each academic year. While attending or watching this Saturday’s opening USC football game against Minnesota is a no-brainer, there’s still ample time for other activities. In particular, the three-day weekend is a great opportunity to explore Los Angeles and discover what the sprawling metropolitan city around us has to offer.
Here’s a quick guide to great stops for everyone this Labor Day weekend in Los Angeles:
 
The L.A. County Fair
For: The kid at heart
When: Saturday, Sept. 3, through Monday, Sept. 5; then Wed-Sun from Sept. 7 – Oct. 2
Where: The Fairplex in Pomona, about a 35 mile drive from USC
The rundown: If you’re looking for great entertainment and don’t have the energy to trek all the way to Vegas, the L.A. County Fair should be your next stop. In addition to offering rides, live music and unique animal attractions such as a live shark encounter and jungle camp, the fair has a deep history in California dating back to 1922.
 
The Taste
For: The foodie
When: Friday, Sept. 2 at 7 p.m., through Monday, Sept. 5 at 7 p.m.
Where: Beverly Hills, Hollywood and Downtown L.A.
The rundown: A food and wine festival spanning three locations across Los Angeles, The Taste presents everything from cooking demos and tastings from the nation’s top chefs (such as food truck legend Roy Choi and the Food Network’s Chopped judge Scott Conant) to wine tastings and mixing munching with movie screenings.
 
FYF Fest 
For: The music lover
When: Saturday, Sept. 3 at 12 p.m. to 12 a.m.
Where: The Los Angeles State Historic Park in Downtown L.A.
The rundown: With a stacked indie rock and alternative lineup of more than 40 bands including Descendants, Cold War Kids, Explosions in the Sky and Death From Above 1979, the FYF Fest will satisfy anyone’s music fix who can’t wait until next year’s Coachella. In addition to hosting music groups, the event will also cater to people’s funny bones by featuring a slew of comedic acts.
 
Andy Warhol Campbell’s Soup Exhibit 
For: The art geek
When: Saturday and Sunday 11 a.m.-6 p.m., Monday 11 a.m. – 5 p.m until Sept. 19
Where: MOCA Grand Avenue
The rundown: Andy Warhol is one of the most famous artists in the world, and his Campbell’s soup painting collection is perhaps one of the most recognizable works in American pop art. On display at MOCA for a two-month period from July to late September, the showing marks the 49th anniversary of the paintings’ original exhibition, which was also in Los Angeles.
