The Daily Trojan’s top priority has always been to keep the USC community informed. In times of scandal, in times of prosperity and now, as our campus reels with uncertainty, we continue to churn out news.  
It goes without saying that coronavirus has greatly impacted USC. Within the span of a week, the University has gone from announcing a three-day trial period for remote instruction to confirming nearly all classes will be held online through mid-April in response to the virus. 
As students make plans to leave Los Angeles for the next month, the campus population will drop significantly. Because of this, the Daily Trojan has decided to move to a weekly print production schedule. Though we will continue to produce content online daily, the print edition of the paper will come out every Wednesday through April 8, including spring break. The daily edition will resume in conjunction with in-person classes.
Our decision to print weekly comes after lengthy discussions with our editorial staff. This is the first time in the Daily Trojan’s 108-year history that production will scale back to one edition per week. We did not make this decision lightly. 
Given the dwindling number of people on campus and the time demands of producing a daily paper, the weekly format is the best way to balance our desire to inform the community with the barriers that have come up as our staff scatters across the country and globe during this period of remote instruction. 
As the campus’ primary news outlet, it is our responsibility to provide timely and accurate information amid confusion, uncertainty and panic. In our best attempts to keep students, faculty and staff informed, we have added a new tab to our website where you can find all of our coronavirus-related coverage. On that page, you will also see a regularly updated sidebar from our new Twitter account dedicated to sharing information regarding coronavirus’ impact on USC as developments surface. 
As we make this transition to weekly printing, we want to emphasize that we take pride in being one of the few college publications left that publishes daily and our University’s only independent newspaper. The Daily Trojan’s role as a print newspaper is an integral part of our identity as a campus media outlet. Completely shifting online would not be beneficial to our readers, some of whom are staying or working on campus during spring break and during the period of online instruction. 
Before this year, the only other instance the Daily Trojan has strayed from its usual printing routine was in 1992 during the L.A. Riots. As those on campus retreated inside that week, the newspaper staff gathered in the newsroom to put together a paper, despite the publishing period having finished and finals week having begun. The day of publication, staffers stood at campus entrances to hand out issues to the community, serving as its central informer. 
In the same vein, the Daily Trojan believes that despite the chaos and unpredictability facing our University and despite the fact that many students will not be on campus, we must continue to serve as the messenger for our readers. That is something we will continue to be regardless of what the future holds.
Thank you for your support.

All campus tours, admissions events and information sessions through May 3 have been canceled, the Office of Admission announced Friday. The cancellation will remain in effect until after National College Decision Day May 1.
The office will hold virtual campus tours and informational sessions for prospective students throughout April. Demonstrated interest is not considered when making admissions decisions, and students unable to visit campus do not face a disadvantage in the admissions process, the Office of Admission said.
Transfer applicant Anthony Gharib said he thought the decision to cancel in-person admissions events and tour would be especially detrimental to applicants who live far from USC and have not had the opportunity to visit campus. 
“[The campus tour cancellation] definitely impacts especially students who may be out of state and have, for example, spring break, and they want to take a visit,” said Gharib, a freshman majoring in journalism at Glendale Community College. “When you do a virtual tour, you’re not really getting the same experience compared to actually being there.”
High school seniors whose schools have closed have the option to self-submit midyear reports with their fall semester grades and can expect to receive admissions decisions March 26, the originally planned notification date, Dean of Admission Tim Brunold told the Daily Trojan in an email. Transfer applicant decisions will continue on the originally projected timeline as well, with decisions and requests for final transcripts released by the end of the spring semester. 
The Office of Admission will work with students who experience challenges submitting their final transcript from their transfer institution due to closures caused by coronavirus, the University said.
The first-year student May 1 commitment deadline has not currently changed. However, the date may be adjusted after the release of admissions decisions, the email read.
Admitted Students Day, originally scheduled for April 25, has been canceled to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission on campus. The Admission Visitor Center will also remain closed through May 3.

Students will have to leave USC housing beginning Saturday following a memo sent by Provost Charles Zukoski Friday to the USC community, which included answers to multiple concerns from those on campus as the University continues its attempt to mitigate the potential spread of coronavirus. The email provided further clarification on the status of all undergraduate and graduate classes, more information on campus housing for students and an update on work status for University staff and student workers
In-person classes are still scheduled to resume April 14, but USC has acknowledged that this is subject to change depending on developments with the virus.
“Throughout this disruptive period, we remain committed to our academic mission and research enterprise,” the memo read. “Conducting classes remotely is a different experience for many of us and there will be ongoing adjustments that we need to make. I am grateful to see how well our faculty, students and staff have responded to this challenge and transitioned to online instruction.”
Students are expected to leave on-campus housing beginning Saturday and not return until April 13 to reduce the likelihood of transmitting the virus. USC plans to institute partial refunds or credit for students who vacate University housing, the memo read. Plans for reimbursement have not yet been solidified. 
Students who are unable to leave are allowed to remain on campus as long as they notify USC Housing through email; however, they will not be permitted to check in guests until April 14, and residential buildings will only be accessible to students who live in the facility. Students will have access to housing, dining, student health and safety services should they choose to remain on campus. Recreational centers will be closed for the duration of remote instruction.
Students are encouraged to take all essentials, including items for studying, but are not required to move out completely at this time. 
USC said it will continue to support international students’ academic progress should they choose to return to their home countries and be unable to come back to campus due to travel restrictions. The memo outlined that students’ academic programs will assess their options on a case-by-case basis.
“The decision whether to return to your home country is a personal one and should be considered carefully, in consultation with family when possible,” the memo read. “We want you to be where you will feel most comfortable in the coming weeks.”
The University has implemented work-from-home options for staff and student workers from March 16 to April 13, according to the provost. In addition, the University will offer 10 business days of administrative leave for individuals whose work cannot be completed from home, including for student workers.
“This is a public health crisis that is evolving rapidly and we may need to alter these dates in the coming days or weeks based on guidance from health and government officials,” the memo read.
All undergraduate instruction and graduate lectures and seminars will continue online through April 13. USC also clarified that students will not lose academic progress as courses can be completed as normal, allowing undergraduate, master’s, doctorate and professional students who plan to graduate this semester to do so.
Graduate students working in labs may proceed with research and should follow hygiene and social distancing recommendations, according to the memo. Students in health sciences programs will continue clinical rotations and practical course elements, and School of Social Work students may continue with community engagement responsibilities pending approval from each partner organization.
Many campus buildings will be closed to the public, but facilities will continue to be serviced and will remain accessible to faculty, meaning faculty will be able to work from their offices, labs and studios if they choose. Faculty members are expected to continue to mentor doctorate students, although mentorship may occur remotely.
At this time, the University still plans on celebrating commencement as normal. However, this is subject to change. USC will continue to monitor the situation in the coming weeks.
“This is not the spring semester we ever wanted, especially for our seniors and those about to graduate,” said President Carol Folt in a letter to the community that was sent alongside Zukoski’s update. “Spring semester is usually filled with events, programs, thesis presentations, recitals, competitions, and celebrations …  While we remain hopeful that we will be able to resume on-campus activities and host a full set of commencement events, we know this may not be possible.”
Zukoski reiterated that there are no cases of coronavirus at USC but stated that it is the University’s responsibility to encourage social distancing as a means of preventing the virus’ spread.
“We are a vibrant, global community with connections all over the world, and your health and safety are paramount,” the memo read. “All of the decisions we are making, and will continue to make in the coming days, are focused on your well-being.”

All USC study abroad programs in continental Europe, including in Spain, the Netherlands and Greece, will require students to return to their home country, the Office of Overseas Studies announced Thursday in an email to students in the programs. 
This move comes after President Donald Trump’s Wednesday Oval Office address, which outlined U.S. measures in response to coronavirus. The United States has temporarily implemented a 30-day ban on noncitizens traveling from European countries, excluding the United Kingdom and Ireland, and U.S. citizens traveling from continental Europe will likely have to undergo health screenings if they arrive after midnight Friday. 
“Given these changes, we are asking USC students studying in Europe outside the UK to return home,” the email read.
According to the email, international students studying abroad have been asked to return to their home countries instead of the United States. 
Students in the Netherlands study abroad program have said they were told by Maastricht University that they will not receive credit for the current term of study, which will end in two and a half weeks. This is because Maastricht University has not stopped instruction or moved classes online and does not currently plan to for the remainder of the term. The status of credits for classes in the following and final term of instruction, which runs from April to June, remains undecided as Maastricht University evaluates how it will manage classes.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, USC said student degree progress will be determined on a case-by-case basis. 
“We are making arrangements on an individualized basis for all returning students so they can continue their degree progress despite the mid-semester disruption,” the statement read. 
Students studying in the Netherlands have not received information from USC specifically related to their program.
The Basque government announced Thursday the closure of all educational centers in Basque Country until March 26. As a result, Universidad de Deusto’s International Spanish Center program, which those abroad in Bilbao, Spain, have been attending, canceled all in-person classes until the end of the program and will continue its academic semester online beginning March 23. 
Kelsea Picarella, a junior majoring in biological sciences studying at the International Spanish Center, said students in the program anticipated an announcement from the University asking them to return when the Madrid program was cut short earlier and have been working to make travel arrangements since Trump’s address. She said USC has not given International Spanish Center students an exact date by which they need to return home.
“The amount of cases in Spain skyrocketed in like two days, which was kind of nerve-wracking for us,” Picarella said. “We were just waiting it out to hear from USC because we had heard that the Madrid program had been canceled.”
USC said it plans to compensate students who are returning from study abroad programs in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Level 3 countries, it said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. 
“Due to the COVID-19 situation, USC will reimburse study abroad students for any flight change fees that they are not able to have waived to return home from CDC Level 3 countries,” the statement read.
To be reimbursed for their travel, International Spanish Center program students will need to provide documentation, including their departure dates, bank routing numbers and Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication numbers.
