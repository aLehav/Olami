Three games into USC’s season, redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo and senior tailback C.J. Gable can barely be found on the stat sheet.

Although the two seniors had at times been starters under former coach Pete Carroll, they have struggled to find playing time in their respective roles as linebacker and tailback under new coach Lane Kiffin.
Instead, Kiffin moved both of them to the special teams unit, which Carroll mostly treated as an afterthought.
Kiffin pays more attention to special teams than his predecessor and saw a place where former starters could make an impact on the team. He said he is impressed with how Galippo and Gable have handled their new roles — even though they include less playing time.
“Those are steps to becoming a really good team, when you have older guys who aren’t playing as much as they have in the past and they go out and play like that,” Kiffin said. “C.J. had a huge block on the kickoff return and a huge tackle on kickoff coverage [last game]. Chris Galippo had a huge play on kickoff coverage to start the game, so it’s good to see guys like that understand how important it is, no matter what play, to have the same effort.”
For Galippo, the transition to being primarily a special teams player wasn’t easy, but he has learned to embrace his new role.
“I’ve taken special teams pretty seriously and I’ve performed well on special teams,” Galippo said. “It’s just what I do. I prepare myself the best I can so that when I get in a game I have the opportunity to contribute to the team. As a player you learn how to develop into whatever your role on the team is, and as an older guy and veteran, I think I’m doing pretty well.”
Special teams coordinator John Baxter said he is impressed and pleased with the leadership that Galippo has shown on special teams. Galippo has emerged as de-facto captain for the unit, and the coaches have noticed his leadership.
“The thing that I believe in is that they didn’t sign up for linebacker, wide receiver or tailback. They signed up for football,” Baxter said. “All we’re doing is playing football and they’re really embracing these roles. This is a good advertisement for the things we’re teaching, which is toughness, discipline and team.”

Despite the strong performance by senior tailback Allen Bradford, Kiffin said he still doesn’t know who the starting running back will be this weekend.
Kiffin rotated all three running backs in practice Tuesday and said he’ll use the rest of the week to see how each player performs.
Incumbent redshirt junior starter Marc Tyler was benched last week when he fumbled the ball, giving Bradford the opportunity to get more playing time.
“Allen made the most of [his opportunity], so now he’s made it a very close competition,” Kiffin said. “We’ll figure it out throughout the week.”
—
Freshman safety Patrick Hall returned from suspension to practice with the team for the first time since the season started.
Hall was suspended five days before the Hawai’i game by Kiffin for unspecified reasons. Hall, a former five-star recruit and All-American in high school, could compete for playing time in the young secondary this season.
“He did everything we asked for in three weeks,” Kiffin said. “He really seems to have changed his attitude from downstairs in academics to upstairs with us. It’s good to see him change so it’s good to have him back.”

When tailback Reggie Bush hurdled over UCLA cornerback Marcus Cassel in December 2005, he was there.
When wide receiver Mike Williams reminded us of his greatness with a one-handed catch for the ages against Oregon State in 2003, he was there.
And when DeMar DeRozan and Daniel Hackett helped to lead a legendary USC basketball team to the podium stage of the Pac-10 championship in March 2009, he was there.
For all of those great moments and images frozen in Trojan lore, odds are that Jon SooHoo is neither the name nor the face with which you associate them.
But for every cardinal-and-gold-draped running back who takes one final stride toward the end zone and for every USC shooting guard who lifts up for one last attempt from three-point range, SooHoo and his camera are never far behind.
What started as the dreams of a fresh-faced Daily Trojan photographer in the darkroom of the Student Union building back in 1981 has subtly transformed into a collage of some of this university’s most riveting sports moments throughout the past three decades.
“I always found the darkroom experience to be such an awesome time,” SooHoo said as he reflected upon where the origins of his passion began. “The idea of taking a shot, developing it into print and then publishing it was fascinating.”
But arguably the most fascinating thing that often goes overlooked about SooHoo, whose time as USC athletics’ chief photographer has spanned from the glory years of Cheryl Miller to the Heisman campaign of former quarterback Matt Leinart, is what drives him to keep shooting.
“For me, it’s about the art,” SooHoo said without hesitation. “Looking back on it all, I wouldn’t change anything. I could have taken pictures for the Angels or for UCLA. But why would I? What better platform to create art than taking pictures for the Dodgers and USC.”
Although the rise of online journalism and photojournalism has threatened the role in which SooHoo has grown accustomed through the years, the Silver Lake, Calif., native has never wavered in his pursuit of the next great shot.
What can’t be seen in the black-and-white photo plastered beside the USC game summary in the Sunday edition of the Los Angeles Times or in the Sports Illustrated candid of the Trojans’ clinching the 2004 national championship in Miami is the love that gets poured into each picture.
Call it a cheesy line to get a quick smile, but SooHoo enjoys bringing the action to your fingertips. Somewhere between technology’s rapid rate of growth and society’s insatiable appetite for accessibility to the entertainment world, there still lies a man who finds solace in preserving an era of influential recollections that seemingly play second fiddle to a new-age approach of image consumption.
“Nowadays, what has changed are the expectations of the public. The public is now being saturated with people throwing so much crap at them, whether it’s by cell phones or with point sheets or whatever it may be, that the appreciation for photography is not there anymore,” SooHoo said. “But I love what I do, and I don’t really care what other people are looking for or what their expectations may be. I shoot for me.”
Although this me-first attitude might put off some people at a time where it seems every accolade or landmark achievement is fading or finding its way out of Heritage Hall, having SooHoo as the school’s protector of on-field masterpieces is a comforting thought.
Be it the Bush push, a Rodney Peete scamper toward the pylon or Notre Dame’s linemen nearly taking off the head of former USC quarterback Sean Salisbury, NCAA penalties and the expected two-year-long stigma that will continue to follow the program have no jurisdiction when it comes to the work of SooHoo.
The seasoned photographer has captured the beauty of Robert Woods’ unperturbed gate as he breaks free down the left sideline in Minnesota, the sullen look on sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley’s face as he walks off the field in the moments following an errant pass or the sternness of USC coach Lane Kiffin as he heads to the locker room in disgust after watching another underwhelming half of football from his novice-laden team.
These moments of ephemeral emotion are what inspire SooHoo to hop on a plane for the weekend to cover a game in Minneapolis or Pullman, Wash.
Because, as much as the art means to him, sharing the frames of unscripted feeling and uncommon imagery with the millions of fans that make up USC’s rabid base is a joy that comes with no price tag attached.
Sadly, chances are that most people are often more preoccupied with the product than its producer.
Social media has impressed upon us that the most efficient way to grasp an entire story told in album form is by skimming through the pictures as fast you can.
It’s why when you read up on the analysis of last week’s 32-21 USC victory the images that showed up on your computer screens, newspapers or weekly magazine subscriptions probably lasted about as long as the Golden Gophers’ lead held up in the third quarter.
Although SooHoo recognizes this trend as much as the next sports photographer, it doesn’t deter him from maintaining the vision he has held onto, even after all of these years — making art from the snapshots of history.
It’s why SooHoo wastes little time fretting about being overlooked by the general public.
“I want, if I could, to be remembered simply as a really nice guy who took good pictures,” SooHoo said.
Yet even as the self-effacing sentinel of the Trojans’ last three decades of treasured athletic moments deflects the type of attention that his body of work deserves, it’s safe to say that SooHoo’s legacy won’t fade, even if change continues to wreak havoc in his profession.
My advice for the next time you are so eager to pillage through a gallery of USC’s future batch of can’t-miss moments: Look at it a little harder with a more appreciative eye.
I promise that beneath the poster-worthy reverse dunk or the ridiculous full-extension touchdown grab and soon-to-be desktop background is something far more special.
It is a timeless love affair between an artist and his canvas — one which SooHoo has afforded all of us, sports fans and otherwise, the privilege of witnessing firsthand.

The No. 6 USC women’s volleyball team (11-0) defeated UC Irvine (4-8) Tuesday night, closing out its nonconference season with an undefeated record as it heads toward Pac-10 play.
Still rising · Junior Alex Jupiter had 13 kills and 10 digs to help lead the Women of Troy to victory Tuesday night against host UC Irvine, marking USC’s 11th win in a row. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The Women of Troy downed the Anteaters in consecutive sets, 25-16, 25-18, 25-11, with junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter recording 13 kills, seven of which helped USC come back in the second set after being down 18-16. Junior setter Kendall Bateman recorded 41 assists with two kills and one ace, finishing with a .667 hit percentage.
USC jumped to an early 8-2 lead in the first set and was able to fend off a game-tying Anteater comeback with four consecutive points to take a 15-11 lead. USC maintained the offensive attack and closed out the first set with another six unanswered points.
In the second set, Irvine provided more of a challenge for the Women of Troy, pulling out to a 17-14 lead. But once again, a scoring rout by USC put the set out of reach for the Anteaters, as the Women of Troy recorded nine consecutive points to take a 2-0 game lead.
The third set was the most lopsided, as freshman middle blocker Alexis Olgard recorded three kills in the first nine points, and USC took an early 8-1 lead. The Women of Troy didn’t look back, winning the set in runaway-fashion 25-11.
“It’s always hard to win on the road, let alone win 3-0,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “Irvine played a great second game, but we hung in there.”
Freshmen have played an enormous role in the Women of Troy’s success this year, including freshman outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana, who recorded nine kills with two aces Tuesday night.
“Our freshmen are a huge part of our success,” Haley said. “With six of them on the roster, they are a major piece of this team.”
Though some believed that the Women of Troy would come out fatigued after having played four games in just five days, Haley said he was not worried.
“We were physically strong the whole time,” he said. “We made sure to get good rest. This team has done a great job of being disciplined this year.”
The Women of Troy begin the conference season against UCLA this Friday at the Galen Center. When asked about the upcoming rivalry game, Haley showed only enthusiasm.
“I’m very excited for UCLA,” he said. “They are another top-10 team, and it should be an unbelievable showdown.”

It’s easy to think you’ve seen everything there is to see on the Internet these days. After all, a lot of the things you see online are very similar
There are the always-interesting viral videos, ads with slick production values and web pages with gorgeous layouts — all things that we take for granted. Innovation is always the goal in today’s world of online development, but it is an elusive one. We tend to forget what true flashes of genius look like. But, when all the pieces fall together perfectly, the results can be astonishing.
Take, for example, The Wilderness Downtown.
It’s a simple link (thewildernessdowntown.com) with an enigmatic name. What is it? It’s hard to tell at first.
The home page gives a few hints: It is an interactive film by Chris Milk, it features the Arcade Fire song “We Used to Wait” and, in the lower left corner, the site calls itself a “Chrome Experiment” made with the help of “some friends from Google.” A small flock of animated birds drifts lazily around and across the page. There is only one instruction: “Enter the address of the home where you grew up.”
You follow the instruction, of course. And then it begins.
The music: “We Used To Wait” is an incredible single, one that builds and soars in all the right places with lead singer Win Butler’s wistful crooning weaving in and out of smartly orchestrated instruments.
The video is a progression of conventional clips that make way for sophisticated uses of technology that showcase the amazing ability of cutting edge new media to stay emotionally relevant instead of just being technology. Google Maps and Street View make an appearance here, and they seem more amazing because of it.
Go ahead, follow the movie’s instructions and draw something for your former self. It’s fantastic.
Yet, even for all of this, the magic of The Wilderness Downtown is more than the sum of its parts. It works on so many levels that the result is at least mildly mind-boggling.
First of all, it’s an artistic achievement that highlights filmmaker Chris Milk’s abilities as well as Arcade Fire’s musical talent.
But it’s not just art; simultaneously it’s a cold, hard showcase of what technology (in this case, HTML5) can accomplish. And it’s not just a showcase, but a disturbingly effective advertisement for Google Chrome, as HTML5 runs optimally on that browser, even warning visitors using other browsers that the video might not work as smoothly as possible and  giving them an option to download Chrome — genius.
And to top it all off, it’s a sort of gauntlet thrown down by Google to show off the power of Chrome, a trump card that says exactly what kind of establishment Google is.
Through all that cleverness and gee-whiz fireworks, the viewer is still able to stand up from the desk feeling something else. Maybe wonder, maybe loneliness, perhaps a longing for childhood or a hometown. Some two-hour feature films that have a tough time being thought-provoking — Michael Bay films come to mind. Chris Milk stepped up to quite a challenge on this one.
“I love trying to tell stories in new ways using technology,” Milk said in an interview with Time.com. “My biggest concern, though, was finding something that would emotionally resonate with people without getting them bogged down in that technology.”
The short film, however, is a success.
“This music video collaboration is a fascinating combination of things,” said Yoshie Suzuki, who teaches Digital Storytelling (IML 140) for USC’s Institute of Multimedia Literacy. “It’s the blend of the song’s nostalgic topic, married with the newness of the technological world we live in that makes this a compelling work.”
The Wilderness Downtown isn’t the only noteworthy example of interactive media on the Web. Another clever, albeit less serious, demonstration comes in the form of a white-out commercial.
Tipp-Ex, a branded product of the BIC Corporation, has an interesting video on YouTube titled “NSFW. A hunter shoots a bear!”
In the video, a bear sneaking into the campsite of two hunters surprises them, one of whom reaches for a gun. The viewer is eventually left with a decision: shoot the bear or not?
What unfolds is a clever twist that makes advertising sense and leaves the viewer positively associating Tipp-Ex white-out with a great Internet video. It’s similar to Burger King’s 2004 “The Subservient Chicken” campaign but potentially more effective because of the surprise manipulation of the YouTube page. In any case, the whole thing just works.
Is this the new face of media in the age of developing technologies? It’s hard to believe that the very disparate worlds of art, technology and corporate promotion can combine to form an amalgam that successfully highlights all the players involved. And yet The Wilderness Downtown and, to a lesser extent, the advertisement for Tipp-Ex, prove that such a thing is possible.
These achievements raise the bar for those who are caught in yesterday’s conventional methods of dictating practices of the audience and consumers. Although interactive multimedia might not work in all formats, it shows signs of brilliance at the crossroads of low pop culture.
Erin Loadvine, an IML student majoring in cinema-television critical studies, points out an important result of all of this.
“The amount of choice offered by both videos is refreshing,” she said.
Refreshing. That’s an adjective that should be used for the media more often. The Wilderness Downtown and inspired ads such as Tipp-Ex’s video show that thinking outside the box can win big. With a little luck, the future will bring more refreshing content that ultimately leaves us thinking about the artistic and technological world that we live in today.

Woody Allen is so omnipresent in modern American romantic-comedy films that every now and then it’s refreshing to see the master’s take on the genre that he helped shape.
Allen has always been able to draw the complexity out of the simple while balancing five or more distinctly dark characters. In You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, Allen achieves just that, creating a highly enjoyable, unnerving addition to his enormous body of work. It’s not his best work, but it’s a memorable gem of a film that proves once and for all that this guy can best most modern romantic comedies in his sleep.
It almost feels wrong to relegate it to a realm ruled by brainless situational snores, because Stranger has an astounding moodiness and psychological depth.
In the typical Allen film, his male characters are projections of himself (and in the past, usually played by himself), and the female characters seem to be representations of women who have frustrated him. This trend repeats in this film but with a unique twist. The women are classic dames comparable to Annie Hall’s title character and Manhattan’s Tracy. And the twist? Allen has split his charming wit, fidgety neuroticism and, for the first time on film, aged self into different characters.
One of those men, perhaps a biting, fictional psychological portrait of the aging Allen himself, Alfie (Anthony Hopkins), is the Eve of the film, the inspiration for everyone else’s sin. The elderly, good-natured but self-centered man is played to a pitiable perfect pitch by Hopkins.
After dissolving his 40-year marriage with Gemma Jones’ Helena, Alfie marries the first hot young thing he can get his hands on. In this case, it’s a money-grubbing hooker (Lucy Punch) with something less than a heart of gold. His questionable relationship choices kick start a new wave of infidelity across the London setting.
His daughter (Naomi Watts) is frustrated with her once-promising novelist husband who has become a schlub (Josh Brolin), so she begins to flirt with her debonair and married boss. Speaking of her novelist husband (the neurotic version of Allen, here named Roy), he’s looking to the woman in red for artistic inspiration and hoping for a little something extra. The woman in red, played by the stunningly gorgeous Freida Pinto, is engaged to a more age-appropriate man but never really spurns Roy’s neurotic charm and the web of lies tangles itself.
There’s certainly nothing spoiled here, because the real pull is the sharpest writing seen from Allen in many years. Even the stagecraft is pointed, unsettling and lightning-paced. As these characters get caught in each other’s downward spirals, Allen could have let the viewer sit back and enjoy but instead ropes everybody — including himself — into the entanglement.
None of these fascinatingly flawed characters come out of the film’s plot clean. Woody’s incisive and downright nasty treatment of his characters is a vitriolic comment on love and relationships.
It is often the case with the great aging writers — from Philip Roth to Heinrich Böll — that their anger never subsides over the years. Don’t mistake this anger for bleakness because the film is funny as hell. But it is dour and might only be funny because it is all happening to somebody else, half a world away.
It’s not a great advertisement for London tourism, but it’s a great film

Horror movie villains are not real. Freddy can only harass Elm Street on the silver screen and Jason’s hunting grounds are limited to a fictional summer camp. Right?
Frightening sights · Creative director John Murdy creates the fright factor behind Universal Studio’s Halloween Horror Nights. - Photo courtesy of Universal Studios Hollywood 
John Murdy begs to differ. As creative director of Universal Studios Halloween Horror Nights, Murdy makes it his top priority to recreate iconic horror films as realistically as possible in maze form and to instill sheer terror within the souls of those who dare to enter these mazes.
“A maze is different from sitting in a movie theater — that’s boring,” Murdy said. “Here you’re walking right through a horror movie. You’re living it.”
At a media preview of “Friday the 13th: Kill, Jason, Kill,” one of the five featured mazes at this year’s Horror Nights, Murdy led the tour with an enthusiasm typically reserved for a kid in a candy store. His excitement was reasonable, since preparing the five-week event is a year-round commitment.
Separate rooms within the maze contain impressive detailed replicas from the Friday the 13th series. Vivid visual effects, however, are only a part of the experience. The Horror Nights team works directly with the creators of famous horror films to set up locations that are authentic in every way. The goal is to offer a frightening but fun experience for guests.
“The performers can’t physically touch the people walking through the maze, so we use a bunch of different things to psychologically prey on our guests,” Murdy said.
Each maze has its own thematic soundtrack, music and dialogue used in the films. While Jason attacks various victims, blood (distilled water) will spray onto those nearby. Guests are even exposed to potent scents during their visit: pine trees while walking through the forest, rotting food in the kitchen — even the stench of dead bodies.
“These things make people feel like their cone of safety is being violated,” Murdy said.
One important scare tactic employed by the maze actors is the distraction gag. Visitors of the “Friday the 13th” maze are instantly hit with one of these the moment they walk into the wooded Camp Crystal Lake. As all eyes are on the bloodied man in a bear trap calling for help, Jason sneaks up behind the unsuspecting guests.
Other mazes on the lineup for this year’s Halloween Horror Nights are “A Nightmare On Elm Street: Never Sleep Again,” “Saw: Game On,” “Rob Zombie’s House of a 1,000 Corpses in 3-D zombievision” and “Vampyre: Castle of the Undead.” These themes were chosen based off of fan input and Murdy’s personal recipe for maximum scares. The three things Mundy said he looks for in a potential maze are villains achievable with live actors, strong stories with a large fan base and extensive environments.
Over the past five years, Halloween Horror Nights has become such popular events that filmmakers have started to seek out Murdy and his team in hopes of adding their film to the lineup.
“It’s a trip for people who make these movies to come by,” Murdy said. “They get to see the characters that they created attack them.”
Casting the ones who do the actual scaring is a tall order. Murdy says working the maze is physically demanding because it produces a new scene every 10 seconds. The hundreds of actors had to endure a stringent audition process and a “Scare Academy,” where Murdy teaches them the proper way to elicit thrills and chills.
Halloween Horror Nights features many more attractions, such as six scare zones, a live show, the Terror Tram and a special chance to visit the Psycho house and Bates Motel in celebration of the iconic film’s 50th anniversary.
Murdy is rightfully satisfied with the high quality of the attractions this year and said he hopes the guests will be equally fulfilled.
“Horror fans are all the same  — they just want more, more, more,” Murdy said. “No matter how extreme we make it, they want it more extreme.”
Undoubtedly the mind of Murdy will churn out even scarier ideas for next year’s Halloween Horror Nights, but hopefully he won’t create a maze based on his own personal phobia — cotton balls.
“It’s something about the texture,” said Murdy with all seriousness. “I can’t even talk about it.”

The welcome signs posted at entrances to Santa Monica State Beach host a list of rules that must be observed while enjoying Los Angeles’ most beloved sandy stretch: No temporary enclosures, no percussion instruments, no audio devices after 10 p.m., no loitering under the pier. These are just a few of the many laws the famously strict city allowed to be broken for its inaugural run of Glow, a biennial dusk-till-dawn art festival that returns to Santa Monica this weekend.
The 2008 event, inspired by Paris’ popular Nuit Blanche, featured commissioned artworks that took over Santa Monica State Beach, the Santa Monica Pier and Palisades Park for a full night of interactivity meant to transform the by-day tourist hotspot into a free-for-all, pop-up playground-meets-museum.
In its first year, Glow featured site-specific works, such as pirate lullabies on the sand, moving trash mobiles hanging under the pier, audio-stimulated projections on a water-mist wall and an orchestral work performed from the baskets of the iconic ferris wheel.
Still, Glow’s well-meaning first attempt was not without its faults.
For nearly 12 hours — the event ran until 7 a.m. — the estimated 200,000 Angelenos that showed up expecting a large-scale city-organized event were instead met with overcrowded access points, inefficient signage, cancelled performances, botched electronics and overall mass confusion.
After battling Santa Monica’s already brutal parking situation to get into the event (the city said it only expected 25,000 visitors), many attendees complained that they did not know where to actually go to find the art, and when they did it was either experiencing technical difficulties or not mind-blowing enough to be worth the trek.
For these reasons, Glow’ first run could be considered a failure — a city’s botched attempt to create a signature cultural event — but that wouldn’t be entirely fair. Though the overload of attendees in 2008 created unexpected chaos at what was supposed to be a low-key, interactive experience, it also proved that L.A. residents are ready to accept large-scale public interactive art as part of the city’s ever-shifting identity.
So this year, Glow is up to the task and is ready to give Los Angeles the all-night culture fest it craves. Glow has employed a brand-new marketing campaign that aims to train visitors for what to expect before they arrive.
This includes interactive Google maps, public transit information, tips on how to plan one’s visit and an hourlong audio guide/downloadable soundscape created by KCRW’s Jason Bentley. And to curb the amount of impromptu drum circles and drunken hangers-around, the hours have been scaled back to end at 3 a.m. — still an impressive time to be traipsing around on a crowded Southern California beach.
The idea behind the art, however, remains the same. Taking its name from the glow of the local grunion fish as it gets tossed through the waves during mating season — a quintessential Southern California sight — all of the commissioned pieces are asked to respond to the coastal landscape and utilize, in one way or another, the symbolism of light.
Words such as “glittering,” “illuminated” and “glowing” are all over the descriptions of works that will be presented Saturday night. Pieces include a moon-themed karaoke room, an evolving lifeguard tower that responds to audio and visual input, a light-filled reinterpretation of the original muscle beach and a real-time screening of a day on the sand.
Machine Project — an Echo Park-based art collective currently in residence at the Hammer Museum — is returning with three musical performance concepts scattered throughout the area, including the return of authentic sea shanties sung by local freak-folk band Featherbeard and a cache of wandering musicians playing instruments for festivalgoers.
Glow also stepped outside of its previous artistic boundaries by making interesting connections with local businesses and organizations whose projects are expanding the boundaries of what can be done with public art.
The 18th Street Art Center and L.A. Commons will lead a procession down the Third Street Promenade to mark the official start of Glow (and spend the evening trying to balance the earth and the sun, per the local Native American legend The Sun and the Coyote). The Border Grill restaurant will take over a living locomotive steam engine parked just north of the pier, turning food preparation into a living, interactive sculpture. And the Los Angeles Nomadic Division — a non-profit public art curatorial group — will present Yoshua Okón’s projections of pitbulls and their owners against the outside wall of Hot Dog on a Stick on Ocean Front.
Unlike Paris’ Nuit Blanche or Berlin’s Lange Nacht der Museen, however, Glow is a uniquely L.A. creation. Forgoing the museums-open-all-night draw — which is already satisfied by late-night events such as the Natural History Museum’s First Fridays — Glow reappropriated the city-as-de-facto-museum idea and gave it an interactive twist.
“It’s not just about looking at art,” Jessica Cusick, cultural affairs manager for the City of Santa Monica, said to Defamer before Glow’s inaugural run in 2008. “It’s about changing the paradigm. Instead of just looking at it, you are in some way contributing to the experience.”

USC is an ideal place for people to meet, collaborate and bring visions to life. That is exactly what seven students set out to do in 2009, coming together to form the musical septet, The Beat Advocate.
The members of the band include Nate Howard (vocals),  Lily Elise (vocals), Aaron Childs (guitar), Robert Nagelhout (bass), Bryan Jarett (drums), Peter Johnson (keyboard) and Justin Klunk (saxophone).
Katrina MacGregor and Sarah Bennett | Daily Trojan
Ever since the hip-hop/funk band formed, the only direction it has been going is up. From playing at a variety of USC and area high school events, The Beat Advocate has quickly gained positive recognition.
Now, to celebrate its upcoming eponymous EP release, the band is headlining a free show at Tommy’s Place on Friday.
Although the band plays funk music, the members do not like to be lumped into just one genre.
“After our first few shows, fans often compared us to bands such as The Roots, Black Eyed Peas and Gym Class Heroes. Our influences are much broader than that,” Klunk said.
The band members’ diverse musical backgrounds, including hip-hop, jazz, pop and rock, combined with their dedicated love for music, a group that has a lot to offer.
Their shows are filled with an energy that gets the audience on its feet. People throw their hands up in the air to the solid groove and soulfulness of The Beat Advocate’s music. The band loves to entertain, but its performances are more than entertainment.
The Beat Advocate’s name also has a dual meaning, as the band tries to advocate everyday issues through its music. One of The Beat Advocate’s songs, “Type of Stereo,” addresses the act of stereotyping and how it affects individuals and society.
The group’s EP was recorded and mixed over the summer and the band is ready to showcase its final product.
“We really wanted to take our time finding someone who believed in our project, had great input and was easy to work with,” Klunk said.
The EP will be streaming on the band’s AbsolutePunk, Facebook and MySpace pages, and will soon be released on iTunes.  Hard copies of the EP will be among the merchandise sold at Friday’s show, which starts at 8 p.m.
I’ve seen Justin Klunk perform in a different setting and he is an amazing sax player. If the rest are as good as he is, this band must be awesome.
the show is on thursday night, not friday

Many things have been said about the loud and frustrating debacle that has been bike regulation on campus this semester. It’s gotten to the point where no one can quite differentiate between the fact, the fiction and the just plain absurd.
In what might be the most anticlimactic uproar campus will see all semester, indignant students should know that nothing — not a single rule or regulation — regarding bikes on campus has changed since last year, and isn’t scheduled to.
Students, it seems, have been flying off the handle for no reason.
It’s understandable. After all, the walking-only zone punctuating campus traffic, coupled with the Department of Public Safety’s hoarse battle cry of “Walk your bikes!” has done nothing to discourage the ravenous ’SC rumor mill.
But as it stands now, the only restrictions facing on-campus biking is the no-bike zone on Trousdale Parkway and Childs Way, and even that is only in effect from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
That ban isn’t going anywhere — it’s been included in the SCampus  student guidebook this entire time — but the number of DPS officers patrolling the area will be decreased from four to two, and their only job will be to write citations, according to USC officials at a bike forum held last week.
The task at hand now is to re-evaluate how to best fold the ever-swelling ranks of bicycles into a campus that remains the same size.
Sixty-three percent of students surveyed in a Undergraduate Student Government  poll said they have been hit by bikes on campus. DPS, USG, Students Affairs and the Department of Career and Protective Services are all working to deal with the issue. What they all need is for students to collaborate and offer constructive insight — not just complaints.
A forum was hosted Sept. 14 as part of the Campus Conversation Series where students were able to share their ideas with administrators and get a better scope of the situation. Ultimately, attending future forums, voicing suggestions to USG and cooperating with the minor restrictions that DPS imposes upon our cross-campus excursions is the best way to get the bike situation back in the saddle.
I don’t think this changes the need for student involvement in creating a better bike policy. If so many students have been getting hit, it means something needs to change, and I think we students need to be the primary advocates of said change.
If you want to get involved with creating this new policy, come to Leavey study room 3Z tonight at 6.
Bike on.
Additionally, despite there being “no changes in rules”, going from non-enforcement of a bicycle ban on Trousdale last year to a full-on enforcement of the same bicycle ban on Trousdale this year is a significant and jarring change for the vast majority of students (since a vast majority own bicycles).  It is unreasonable to expect students to take such a large change in stride just because there was a continuity on paper that did not exist in reality.
This situation could have been avoided had administration made the information distributed at the Bicycle Safety Forum available online for all students.  Giving a large amount of information verbally to a small number of students encouraged hearsay, speculation, and misinformation.

Anytime I’ve heard Tea Party updates over the past few weeks, my first thought is always the same: they cannot be serious.
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
With midterm elections coming up, the Tea Party is on the verge of establishing a permanent place for itself in American politics. Incredibly, columnists and pundits across the country are still spending their time analyzing the significance of the movement’s emergence instead of pointing out a crucial yet underemphasized reality: The politicians that have a chance to be elected thanks to Tea Party support can be most flatteringly referred to as eccentric.
Let’s begin with Alaska, where moderate incumbent Lisa Murkowski was defeated in the Republican primary by Joe Miller, who received more than $400,000 this month from the California-based Tea Party Express.
Miller is a stand-up tea partier, meaning he wants to get rid of Medicare, Social Security and the Department of Education. Miller considers unemployment benefits unconstitutional and has called the scientific evidence for climate change “dubious science at best.”He wants to cut foreign aid and United Nations funding at a time when the United States’ international image hangs in the balance and slash funding to the National Endowment for the Arts.
Some of Miller’s other proposals might sound reasonable at first, but they are cloaked in the language of smaller government that would in practice really lead to a paralyzed government.
These include proposals to give the president power to veto line items in spending bills, requiring each bill to note what part of the Constitution gives Congress the authority to enact it and allowing unlimited debate over appropriations bills.
These ideas might be motivated by a sincere desire to hold government more accountable to the people, but it is clear the proposal would create so much unnecessary red tape that it would lead to an even more inept federal government.
As of Sept. 1, Miller is leading in the polls.
Things look even worse in Nevada, where Sharron Angle is the Republican candidate running against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.
Angle agrees with virtually all of Miller’s positions but takes them a step further; for example, she considers the Department of Education’s existence unconstitutional and wants the United States to withdraw entirely from the United Nations, calling it “the umpire on fraudulent science such as global warming.”
Although it is interesting that she believes that “there’s not sound science to back that up,” I personally prefer the findings of an international panel of leading scientists.
Some of Angle’s other career highlights include supporting a prison drug rehabilitation program based on principles of Scientology, counseling young pregnant girls to turn “a lemon situation into lemonade” and publicly stating her opposition to legalizing alcohol, which is either a bad joke or belies Angle’s mistaken belief that we live in the 1920s.
Angle is tied with Reid in the polls.
However, neither of these two fine political specimens can match the recently victorious standard bearer of Tea Party politics: the Delaware Republican Senate candidate Christine O’Donnell.
The 41-year-old Sarah Palin replica has seen her politics — the nature of which closely mirrors Angle’s and Miller’s — take a backseat in recent weeks to two videos of her from the 1990s.
In the first, filmed in 1996, O’Donnell makes a strong stance against masturbation, calling it equivalent to adultery. Sure, the video is scandalous, but we shouldn’t hold her religious views against her. What we can, however, hold against O’Donnell is her 1999 admission on comedian Bill Maher show, Politically Incorrect:
“I dabbled into witchcraft — I never joined a coven. But I did, I did … I dabbled into witchcraft. I hung around people who were doing these things. I’m not making this stuff up. I know what they told me they do. … One of my first dates with a witch was on a satanic altar, and I didn’t know it. I mean, there’s little blood there and stuff like that. We went to a movie and then had a midnight picnic on a satanic altar.”
Because O’Donnell has raised nearly $1 million online, we are now facing a serious threat that she will actually be a U.S. senator next year. Nobody seems concerned about that prospect beyond its potential ramifications for a Democratic or Republican majority.
Something needs to change fast. The federal government, as much as it is maligned, is a serious institution that plays a crucial role in every American’s daily life. Candidates such as Miller, Angle and O’Donnell are threats to the government’s functionality, credibility and overall legitimacy; their success is an indicator of how unsuccessful the U.S. government is at communicating its message to the public and the lack of serious critical thinking that takes place in this day and age.
Hopefully, someone will emerge with the capacity to reverse this worrying trend. Otherwise, we might soon find our Senate filled with even more fools than it already has.

Joseph, you embody the problem.
You dismiss vast numbers of Americans with legitimate political beliefs with words like radical, hate, racist.
Look in the mirror, dude. Glenn Beck hasn’t said anything hateful, and neither are these people.
Their views aren’t radical (as the polls clearly show) — but yours probably are.
As for racist — I won’t even dignify that incredibly idiotic and ill-founded comment with a response. 
Think for yourself, Joseph! Talk about an incredible threat to America.
Polls don’t show radical or moderate, right or wrong, they only measure popularity. Again, I have many friends who are conservative who I respect and admire, I wonder if you could breathe the same about any liberal folks you know.
But this particular movement is fueled by anger and hate, win you may, but I much rather lose on an agenda aimed at helping the most vulnerable in our community and standing up for something bigger than myself. And before you try and make a demeaning comment about paying my own bills and taxes, I have been for a long time now. I am Catholic and it is those beliefs that fuel my political belief.
 As for racism, may I correct myself and say there are certainly elements of the movement that have racist elements. The signs, Mark Williams (who in fairness was expelled) etc…
As for Glenn Beck, maybe us liberal tree huggers have a different definition of hate than you all in the tea party. But I’d sure call the comments below unkind. =)
Glenn Beck quotes:
“I’m thinking about killing Michael Moore, and I’m wondering if I could kill him myself, or if I would need to hire somebody to do it. … No, I think I could. I think he could be looking me in the eye, you know, and I could just be choking the life out. Is this wrong?”
“The only [Katrina victims] we’re seeing on television are the scumbags.” –”The Glenn Beck Program,” Sept. 9, 2005
“When I see a 9/11 victim family on television, or whatever, I’m just like, ‘Oh shut up’ I’m so sick of them because they’re always complaining.” –”The Glenn Beck Program,” Sept. 9, 2005
Nah, you’re right. He’s never said anything hateful.
Oh my gosh, Joseph. Do you really need me to pull out the long list of hateful, nasty, vicious comments made by liberals? In the nasty game, you guys win, hands down. Do a Google search for Hollywood quotes about Bush. Shoot, just read quotes from Michael Moore himself. That will be eye-opening for you. And if that’s the worst you can come up with from Beck (and 5-year-old quotes at that) — again, the issue is what the Tea Partiers are up to. I’m pretty sure that nobody is worried that they’re out to get Katrina victims. Your inanity is only outflanked by your self-righteousness (as you made clear that you are “standing up for something bigger than yourself”). Newsflash, Joseph: that’s what the Tea Partiers are doing, too. Standing up for something they believe in that they think (with history on their side) will improve life for everyone in this country.
Consider the obvious point that the Tea Partiers don’t go around calling people like YOU “haters” and “racists” — but actually are ANGRY about government abuses. In other words, issues. They don’t offer childish arguments like Daniel did, which started this thread: “The other side – they’re scary!” You are offering the same toxin, my friend, so don’t you dare lecture me about being friendly with liberals (the way you, noble soul, are friendly with conservatives). 
As for what’s radical, consider the definition. It means advocating for drastic change. I would submit that people who wish to adhere to fiscal sanity and a limited government as provided in the Constitution — people who wish to protect America from terror at home and abroad — those people are clearly NOT advocating for drastic change. 
On the other hand, leftists who wish to remake our economy into a nanny state a la Europe, and who wish to weaken America’s security, are indeed advocating for fairly drastic change. I think you all called it “hope and change,” in fact. Pres O wanted to dramatically transform America, and all that. Hello, “radical.”
Diane,
Let’s review the debate we were having.
1. I asked if we as a nation will really be turning to the like of Beck and Olbermann as sources of news. You will notice I noted the two extremes. You said Beck has never said anything hateful- I simply presented facts that showed the fallacy of your statement. I never defended anyone on the far left- you did however defend someone on the far right and so I responded.
2. I spoke about the need for a political middle ground. Again, I fashion myself very liberal. I am of the Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Paul Wellstone, and yes, Barack Obama political philosophies. But I understand the need to reach out, to debate with dignity, and yes, maybe even find something that resembles at least a slight common ground. And I guess I’d say that’s something that seems to be leaving politics together as more and more people end up on the extremes.
And so we will forever disagree. I do not like the angry like of Michael Moore anymore than I do of Sean Hannity. I see the Tea Party in those extremes- a movement that is more inflated than real because people are afraid and the Tea Party tent captures that fear and accelerates it. I never said the other side is scary. The other side is a big tent, and I am not afraid of them, it is this fringe element that is the tea party that I consider frightening.
So you can call me inane or self-righteous, you can mock the fact that yes I was and still am motivated by a political belief that calls upon the best of who we are. If any of my comments were personally attacking you as yours were mine, I apologize. I don’t know you and so I have no problem with you, I have a problem with a political movement.  Win or lose, we’ll all need to work together to improve this country. And so after November, it will be interesting to see how the conversation shifts if at all.
God Bless,
Joe
Joe, you continue to bleed self-righteousness. It is not attractive, and it is disingenuous. Here’s why:
The political beliefs you espouse are a direct threat to the America most of us love. You can call it extreme, you can call it angry — but the truth is, YOUR beliefs require a firm response. A firm NO, if you will. That’s what America seems to be gearing up to do. A firm pull back from the far left where we’ve wandered (and where you, by admission, want to go). 
OF COURSE you think we should all move to the center! Your kind have moved us all so far left that the center would now be quite a bit more comfortable for you. But being in the center, my friend, does not solve any problems in and of itself.
As for Beck/Olbermann, puh-leez. You bring up a couple of old semi-serious quotes from Beck, but give Olbermann a complete pass. That’s just silly. Oh, and for the record — he’s not “far right.” He apparently is in the mainstream. Get used to it.
You have a severe perception problem. You think Michael Moore — that angry, often confused filmmaker who says “there is no terror threat” — is comparable with Sean Hannity, who welcomes liberals onto his show EVERY NIGHT to debate issues? I thought you wanted us all to work together? Isn’t that what Hannity is doing? Like most leftists, you really have no idea what Hannity or Beck or Rush or any of them are saying. You only have a knee jerk response to what you think they’re all about. But you know not of what you speak.
Like most liberals, you play the victim card. You were “personally attacked”? No, you weren’t. But your views were. Because they are dangerous and short-sighted. And even as you hide behind your mantle of being “motivated by a political belief that calls upon the best of who we are” (which, by the way, applies to the Tea Partiers as well) — you can’t resist taking a shot at those with whom you disagree — THEY are motivated by fear. YOU, of course, are motivated by all that is pure.
Ha.
Oh Diane,
We can’t have a good debate if you are going to be putting forth straw man arguments. Again, I never defended the likes of Olbermann, I said I didn’t like that we as a nation are turning to the likes of him on the left and Beck on the right for NEWS. You said Beck never said anything hateful, I countered with facts to the contrary. I never said Olbermann has never said anything hateful- you however did claim Beck never did. So I responded with some clarification that calls your argument into question. If you wish to keep distorting my argument there isn’t much more I can say.
Regarding left, right, center, it seems you think liberals have dragged the country so far left we need to pull it past center and far to the right. So be it, we disagree. I think healthy debate is what is missing in politics and has been for several years, across now several sessions of congress and various presidential administrations. I want debate, healthy debate. And I recognize the need for compromise on issues. Do you feel the same?
And to clarify the motivations for my belief- I am a Christian. My views are not fully encompassed by liberals or conservatives, Democrats or Republicans. Maybe you aren’t Christian and if you aren’t then my motivating factor may mean nothing to you. But the motivating factor behind my views is the compassion I learned in Sunday school and that I read about in the Bible. Compassion for those Jesus spent his life advocating for. Show me where there is the compassion Jesus taught us in the Tea Party movement. No party or political group fully captures my views and positions, but I do feel the Tea Party certainly does not get close to it. I see no compassion in this movement, I see nothing of the principles I was taught to live my life by in the policies of this group.
Now, I imagine you will respond with more straw man arguments, but have at it- I leave you with the last word.
Cheers!
Wow, it is frightening to watch the responses come in on this. I am liberal through and through but I understand that compromise is the art of politics. I grew up surrounded by conservatives and so I am blessed to be able to see, for the most part, the rational way in which people come to their political beliefs, even if different than my own cherished beliefs.
And so it troubles me to watch the rise of the Tea Party because I don’t understand how such a radical agenda is so almost main stream. Radical policies, hate, racism, it’s just too much for me. If the Republicans win back Congress I could accept that. It is what it is. But I look at any Tea Party victories as a loss for both parties. Has our nation come to a point where Joe Miller and Sharron Angle are the best we have to send to the United States Senate? Are we at a point where Glenn Beck and Keith Olbermann are who we turn to for “news?” I don’t much care to engage in battles about politics I much rather chug along doing what needs to be done to improve our communities and our world, but I can’t help but infuse my two cents and say the Tea Party is an incredible threat to everything I hold dear about America.
Daniel, you wrote a great article. I know a great number of Republicans who aren’t part of the radical right that are concerned as well. We live in an age filled with apathy and the politics of hate, somewhere there has to be a middle ground. Let’s hope the Tea Party loses and if the Republicans do win in November, as much as it will pain me to see that, let’s hope the two parties can maybe work toward a sensible way to compromise and move forward governing our nation.
Janna, if you choose to ignore the evidence that many scientists are not on board with “climate change” then no amount of URL links are going to help. If you had an open mind, you’d find them yourself.
As for your criticisms of the GOP — perhaps you don’t understand that THAT is EXACTLY the Tea Party’s point. Too many Republicans acting like Democrats. (However, keep in mind that it is Congress that spends the money, and so it’s not entirely accurate to classify that as “8 years of Republican leadership” when talking about spending — just like Congress is spending the money now, not Obama.)
Finally, saying the Constitution was not created to limit federal power is being disingenuous. Anyone with more than a (current) public high school knowledge of American history knows what the Founding Fathers were discussing in setting up this country, which was a union of STATES. The states’ rights were or paramount importance, as was the check-and-balance system, because the founders were well aware of human nature and the natural tendency for power to move toward the central government. Furthermore, the Constitution does in fact LIMIT the federal government severely, whether you like it or not. To use just the example noted below, Carter overstepped his boundaries in creating a new department.
And you show your complete ignorance of the Constitution when you say silly things like “It’s the government’s job to ensure that we can all get an education.” Really? Who says? And which government? As I already pointed out, the states were doing a better job BEFORE Carter paid back his mistress the NEA with their little plum which has cost so much and done so very little. People with the thinking skills you are now exhibiting are the fruit of this folly — people who think we can change the Constitution to whatever the latest liberal wet dream involves. 
And THAT’S common sense for most Americans. Maybe you should tune in to a little Beck. You might learn something.
“Anyone with more than a (current) public high school knowledge of American history knows what the Founding Fathers were discussing in setting up this country, which was a union of STATES.”
FINALLY!  I am so glad to hear someone talking sense about what the founding fathers really wanted.  In fact, I love the founding fathers so much that I want to go back to the REAL Constitution–the Articles of Confederation.  Did you know that those big-government Federalists/liberals ILLEGALLY did away with the TRUE Constitution of these United States?!  Look it up.  I won’t provide a link, you can do that yourself if your mind is open enough.
We should do away with this silly document that some ACTIVIST JUDGES (I’m looking at you, Scalia, you 2nd-amendment-loving clown!) are forcing us to live under.  The Articles of Confederation leaves the power to the true Americans, the States.  Enough of this federal government, I want to see the STATES get power back.  If Texas wants to wash Thomas Jefferson out of the history books, let them.  Who needs a Department of Education when we have the infinite wisdom of STATES RIGHTS.
Where’s George Clinton when you need him, right Diane?  Man, oh man if he could only see this country today…
Even when you’re trying to be satirical, you should at least make sense.
And what, my darling Diane, does not make sense about my previous comments?  The illegality of dropping the Articles of Confederation is unquestionable.  At the Annapolis Convention, the five states that attended decided to endorse the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, but it was ONLY given the power to amend the AOC; instead, they wrote an entirely new Constitution, over the objection of Rhode Island, which under the AOC (the controlling legal document) should have had the power to veto any proposed changes to the AOC, including its elimination.  Instead, the new Constitution was adopted.  Doing what is against the controlling legal document is illegal.  Hence, the dropping of the AOC and the adoption of the Constitution was illegal.
You do have a point about my argument with regards to the Department of Education, however.  Their federal mandate is much less powerful than I originally believed.  Their job, in essence, is to ensure equality of access, to help get federal funds to local schools, and to distribute financial aid.  They have absolutely no power to control the curriculum in any state.  Wait, why is this program an example of federal overreach, again?
Many on the Left have a pathological fear of states’ rights, and quite possibly you are suffering from this malady of ignorance. Bluntly — we don’t NEED the federal government to “ensure equality of access” — even in the most backward states, my friend, somehow everyone gets to go to school if they want to. We don’t need federal funds going to local schools — we need local funds staying local to support schools. We don’t need the federal government to distribute financial aid. Colleges did just fine before Carter and the teacher unions cooked up this Cabinet department. In fact, as pointed out, public schools have declined markedly since the department was founded. What are we to make of that, constitutional questions aside? The fact that Carter had no business doing it just makes it more irritating. 
And your comment about curriculum control is highly disingenuous. He who holds the money holds the power, ultimately. And I can attest to the fact that the Department of Education spends a lot of its time issuing pointless regulations that schools and colleges have to follow, costing millions of dollars. Examples abound, for anyone who cares enough to research it.
Or are you of the mistaken impression that children will be educated more efficiently if someone sitting in Washington DC has all the power, money and decision-making ability?
Spot on, Daniel! Apparently someone at Tea Party HQ has a Google alert out on these candidates so they can spam the comments sections of any negative press. Good lord you people have been watching Glenn Beck too long. 
1. The Constitution and Bill of Rights were not created to limit federal power; they were created to establish the laws of this country and to protect its citizens. That is not necessarily synonymous with “small government,” especially in this day, when the government is not the biggest threat to the American people (unlike, say, during the Revolutionary War). Further, they are living, breathing documents defined by judicial precedence. Their writers knew they could not predict the future, so they made the documents flexible. Take the 2nd Amendment. Semi-automatic weapons and nuclear warheads did not exist in 1776. Do you think that means Jefferson wouldn’t want your right to nuclear material to be infringed on today? Americans cannot survive today without an education. The courts have defined education as a right (see anti-segregation rulings). It’s the government’s job to protect the rights of its citizens, so it’s the government’s job to ensure we can all get an education. That’s common sense for most Americans.  
2. Republicans, a category into which Tea Partiers fall, don’t actually give two sh**s about the deficit. If they did, they would let the Bush tax cuts expire. This myth that Democrats want to “spend their way to wealth” is absurd considering it was 8 years of Republican leadership that tanked the economy and launched the massive deficit. You can’t cut taxes AND fund a war. Common sense. Hasn’t worked for the last ten years, won’t work now. And yet that’s the ONLY suggestion the Republicans have for “fixing the economy.” Also, the bank bailout was under Bush. TARP was a Republican policy, but sure, keep blaming Obama for it. 
3. There is not serious scientific debate about global warming. The scientific community has generally acknowledged its existence for years. Evidence of it was first found in studies conducted at the polar ice caps 30 years ago. I will say it again: 30 years ago.  Only fringe pseudo-scientists paid by oil companies “doubt” global warming. Show me one paper in a peer-reviewed journal that finds serious flaws with the evidence supporting it.
I think you revealed too much, Daniel, when you describe the tea party candidates as “threats to the government”. The incredulous tone of your article does little to dispel the fact that these candidates’ positions are quite reasonable and refreshing. Cutting unconstitutional bureaucracies, instituting a line-item veto, asking Congress to actually read and argue about their bills instead of just voting on the first draft from K street, all sound pretty sane to me. I wonder if you realize how weak it makes your position seem, that the only criticism you have of Christine O’Donnell is that she dated a wiccan in high school, and quoted the Bible on television 15 years ago.
Why not write an article about the insane, loopy things that the Democrats believe? They believe that you can spend your way to wealth, borrow your way out of debt, that bowing to your enemies and abandoning your allies will improve your diplomatic standing in the world, that government-controlled health care and education are “free”, and that the federal government can make better choices about your retirement, the car you need, and even the condiments you can put on your food, than you could make on your own.
If the latter is “sane”, and the tea party is “crazy”… then I’m with crazy!
Oh, Daniel… Daniel. YOU cannot be serious.
Daniel is under the mistaken impression, apparently having spent the last four years entirely under the enchantment of the liberal profs on campus, that certain ideas (like the Department of Education being unconstitutional) are “crazy.”
Daniel, allow me to educate you. No matter your political affiliation, there is no doubt that our founding documents were an effort to protect against the kind of federal power grab that Jimmy Carter undertook as president when he established the Department of Education (much to the delight of the powerful teacher unions). 
One thing you can say — test scores and the overall state of American education HAS gone WAY up since the Dept of Education came into existence!
Oh, wait. It’s the opposite of that. Never mind.
There’s legitimate debate about “climate change.” (And you only demonstrate your ignorance with that snotty comment about how you “prefer the findings of an international panel of leading scientists” — since there are “leading scientists” who disagree. Ever read anything other than the Daily Kos?) Even Democrats have supported the line-item veto. And cutting money to the U.N. and the National Endowment for the Arts is what we HAVE to do because, dear Daniel, the U.S. is going BANKRUPT. 
All of these are not extreme views, and they are held by a majority of Americans. You, Daniel, appear to be a hard-left extremist whose views can most flatteringly be described as eccentric. Others might call them appallingly ignorant and foolish. Talk to us when you start paying your own bills — and your own taxes.
How can you ridicule the so called tea party people questioning their potential effect on “government’s functionality, credibility and overall legitimacy; their success is an indicator of how unsuccessful the U.S. government is at communicating its message to the public and the lack of serious critical thinking that takes place in this day and age”
The majority of the people in the US aggressively oppose the governments stance on Obamacare, the stimulus bills, the bowing to foreign leaders, take over of key industries, “to big to fail” bailouts, endless imperial vacations by the Obamas. 
One could go on. (increasing the defecit by a record 4 trillion) It is hard to imagine a more ant-democratic, anti-American and incompetent US government. It is completely against the will of most Americans. Bristol Palin could do better than the clowns running the government now.

The sounds of sniffling noses and coughing echo throughout the USC campus, signaling the approach of flu season.
Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the upcoming flu season is unpredictable because it changes from year to year.

“It is too early to tell how severe our flu season is going to be,” Skinner said.
In fact, a reappearance of the swine flu virus has not been ruled out, according to Skinner.
The one vaccine that will be offered by USC this year contains, among others, the H1N1 strain, University Park Health Center Nursing Director Tammie Akiyoshi said.
The flu in general is always a concern, Akiyoshi said, but after last year’s swine flu outbreak, health specialists recommend that all people six months of age or older get vaccinated.
“Vaccination is the most important thing you can do to protect yourself,” Skinner said.
Skinner said students living in dorms are at an increased risk of acquiring influenza type B because of their close proximity to one another. influenza type B is also included in the vaccine offered by the health center this year.
The health center will start offering the flu vaccine for $25 at the beginning of October. It will also have outreach clinics on campus and will sponsor the L.A. County Department of Public Health for a flu shot day in October. The specific dates will be announced at a later date.
Despite this advice, some students don’t see the necessity for vaccinations.
Karen Lu, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences, said she thinks she can deal with the upcoming flu season without any vaccines.
“I have a really strong immune system and I believe I can handle the flu,” Lu said.
Other students, such as Logan Benjamin, a sophomore majoring in music industry, are planning to tackle the issue more aggressively.
Benjamin said she is going to take preventative measures this season, by taking vitamins and trying to maintain a healthy sleep schedule.
Students should cover coughs and sneezes, wash their hands frequently and stay home if they are sick to prevent spreading the virus to others, Akiyoshi said.
For those students with heart, lung or kidney disease, asthma or a weakened immune system, getting vaccinated is especially important, she said.

Numbers are up for the Asian Greek Council and Multicultural Greek Council as both organizations reported higher recruitment numbers this fall.
MGC registered about 50 new students, most of whom were women, according to MGC President Celen Rosales, a member of Sigma Lambda Gamma.
AGC gained close to 100 new members, which is a significant amount for the smaller fraternities and sororities focused on Asian American culture, AGC President James Hwang said.
“We have definitely increased our numbers since last year. We’re continuing to experience an upward trend in the amount of ‘rushees’ which are mainly freshman,” said Hwang, a member of Gamma Epsilon Omega.
Hwang said the increased rush numbers might be because of AGC attempts to create a bigger presence on campus during AGC’s rush, which takes place during a two-week period.
“We post fliers everywhere and participate in the various involvement fairs. In the summer, we were also present with other organizations at an orientation for the Asian Americans,” Hwang said.
MGC organizations each have their own rush weeks and  events after the main MGC informational.
The overall goal for next year for both councils is to improve the publicity of their respective organizations and plan more events, including philanthropy activities, on campus.
Both councils also hope to cooperate with each other as well as the other Greek councils at USC.
“We’re working on creating more events to put on the USC calendar,” Rosales said.
AGC is also working to expand its network across the state. It is now involved in the Asian Greek Council of Southern California, which brings Asian American culture organizations from other schools together, connecting the USC organizations with other universities.
“Each organization in the AGC has about 20 to 30 members, so it’s great to be able to network with the organizations from other schools nearby,” Hwang said.
Although the traditionally small councils face challenges for expansion, members said that’s what makes the many multicultural and Asian fraternities and sororities unique.
The smaller organizations allow members and prospectives to know each other on more of a personal level and allow prospective members to choose an organization based more on the interests and personalities of the members, Hwang said.
“We usually receive a small number of bids ranging from one to 10. Ten bids for the organizations in MGC is actually a huge number for us. However, our smaller amount of members per organization allows us to focus on unity,” Rosales said. “For us, recruitment is a lot harder because our council is a lot smaller than most of the others.”
Hwang said the recruitment effort this year went well.
“Overall, I am satisfied with how recruitment went this fall,” Hwang said. “The AGC is increasing as a family and we’re doing our best to make sure prospectives join the fraternity or sorority that is the perfect fit.”

It’s no secret that Colorado and Utah are set to join the Pac-10.
Nobody, however, seemed to know when.
It looks like that question has finally been answered, a source told ESPN.com’s Joe Schad that Colorado is finalizing a deal to move to the Pac-10 next year with Utah.
It’s long been thought that Colorado wasn’t going to join what was to become the Pac-12 until 2012. The school wanted to join its new conference earlier but the problem was money. According to Orangebloods.com, Colorado would owe an 80 percent forfeiture of revenues in a two-year period if it left on one years’ notice.
But Colorado’s attorneys are working to get a deal done between the Big-12 and the school.
“Unless something unforseen happens, I think the Big 12 will be a 10-team league next season,” an official in the Big 12 told Orangebloods.com.
Nebraska is the other team leaving the Big-12 as it’s moving to the Big Ten next season. The combined money Colorado and Nebraska are expected to owe the Big 12 next year for leaving is between $35-40 million, a source told Orangebloods.com.
Pac-10 commissioner Larry Scott declined to comment on the progress of these proceedings, telling ESPN.com’s Ted Miller via text message “They [Colorado] have regents meeting today to discuss the negotiations with Big 12. Beyond that I can’t say.”

With the help of their furry four-legged animals, four pounds of dog treats and multiple cups of coffee, OK Go is at it again in their newest music video “White Knuckles.”
This time, instead of running treadmills, the band goes for performing stunts with show dogs from Talented Animals. If it wasn’t for bass guitarist Tim Nordwind’s trademark hipster glasses and the capital white lettering titling the video “OK GO, WITH FRIENDS,” within the first five seconds, the audience might have believed it was just four guys with too much time on their hands.
Although visually entertaining (I mean, who doesn’t enjoy watching cute animals bobbing their heads to music?), the video doesn’t have the originality of the band’s 2006 hit “Here It Goes Again,” also known as “The Treadmill Video,” or the hilarity of the wallpaper phenomenon “Do What You Want.”
But, for a video that debuted Sunday, it’s already garnered 576,000 hits. By the time I finished watching the three-and-a-half minutes of the sure-to-go-viral video, three more comments had been posted, including “So awesome
So awesome So awesome So awesome.”
A portion of the proceeds from the video’s sales will go to a special fund set up in conjunction with the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Talk about lucky dogs.

Los Angles is a city associated with constant traffic congestion, according to a recent Metropolitan Transportation Authority Report that said more than half of Los Angeles freeways are congested during morning and evening rush hours.
Overall, freeway transportation in Los Angeles has remained relatively consistent from 1991 to 2009, yet the Golden State 5 Freeway is one freeway known for congestion at all times of day, according to the MTA Draft 2010 Congestion Management Program report.
“Without improvements to our current transportation system, and changes in the behavior of the traveling public, the projected increase in population and employment will reduce the average current countywide travel speed of approximately 30 miles per hour to less than 20,” the report said.
To combat potential increases in traffic, MTA’s most recent Long Range Transportation Plan, adopted in 2009, plans to expand bus and rail systems, build new carpool lanes and encourage more ride sharing, walking and bike riding, according to the report.

A proposed California bill would require schools to provide students with fresh drinking water at no charge, but opponents say the bill provides no funding for such program.
Senate Bill 1413, written by Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco), hopes to have schools providing water with student meals by next July, according to the Los Angeles Times.
“As we all know, young people are constantly bombarded by advertisements and pressure from their peers to consume junk beverages that are high in calories and sugar. Yet many students do not have access to free, fresh drinking water at lunchtime,” Leno said in material promoting his bill, according to the Times.
David Binkle, deputy director of food services for the Los Angeles Unified School District, said most schools in the district do not have free water available to students in eating areas.
Binkle said water fountains are more cost effective, and raised concerns with the price of implemented the proposal — water cups cost near 4 or 5 cents each, and there are other costs associated with water testing, filters and equipment.
Really? This is even under debate? i remember being able to drink the water that came out of the ground. I’m only 23. Why is this an issue? I drink tap water all the time. We dont need to waste money on tripe reverse osmosis carbon filtered UV sanitized water. Just hook up a PVC pipe with some drinking holes and attach it to any hose. That’s what we did when I played football in highschool. Good enough for us.

USC men’s water polo driver Peter Kurzeka was named the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Week yesterday because of his clutch performance at the NorCal Tournament.
The junior scored two game-winning goals and seven goals overall to lead the third-ranked Trojans to the tournament title.
The first of Kurzeka’s game-winning goals came in the semifinal against No. 1 Cal. With USC clinging to a one-goal lead late in the fourth quarter, Kurzeka notched his fourth goal of the day to put the Trojans up two. That goal proved to be the winning margin as USC survived a late Cal goal to win 12-11.
But Kurzeka outdid himself the next match in the final. With just four seconds left and the score tied 10-10 against UCLA, Kurzeka rifled a shot passed the keeper to give the Trojans the tournament title.
The victory gave the Trojans an 8-0 record to start the season. This was Kurzeka’s second-career MPSF Player of the Week award and it comes on the tail of USC goalie Joel Dennerley being given the same award the previous week.

Rebecca Carpenter, a 45-year-old single mother looking to go back to school to receive her teaching credentials, sought out USC’s online Master of Arts in Teaching program.
“I had been doing a lot of research on teaching and credential programs and I saw this Facebook ad for MAT@USC,” said Carpenter, who holds a bachelor’s degree from Harvard University and a master of fine arts from the University of Texas at Austin. “I started researching this program and what’s really strange is that it’s perfect for me.”
MAT@USC is an online teaching program offered by the Rossier School of Education. The program, which began in June 2009, provides a fully online experience with interactive lectures and videos to replicate the traditional classroom experience.
Daily Trojan
During the first year, MAT@USC enrolled 144 students, of which 82  graduated in June.
This year’s class consists of 1,000 students, a huge increase from the previous year, said Director of Operations Erika Klein. Yet, the program does not yet know why the numbers increased so rapidly.
The appeal of MAT@USC is in its flexibility for nontraditional students who hold full-time jobs or have families to care for, Klein said.
“We also have people in the military who, because of their situation … have to move around,” Klein said. “With our program, they don’t have to stop their education.”
Carpenter said the versatility of the program was part of the reason she chose it over others.
“I couldn’t afford to not be working. If I’d had to go to USC every day or four days a week or whatever, plus do my observations, there’s no way I could’ve done it,” Carpenter said. “It’s just not realistic for real people’s lives.”
MAT@USC alumna Haley DeMaria of Annapolis, Md., said that when her husband had to work in London for three months, she didn’t have to make the decision between school and family.
“I could have that fun with my family during the day and not have to put my educational goals on hold,” DeMaria, who typically worked on her classes at night, said.
Other perks of the program, Klein said, include its staggered start dates and its particular attention to teaching in low-income, urban settings.
“By going online, we’re producing more and addressing the needs of students across the country. We have students in Alaska, Hawaii, New York,” Klein said. Students enrolled in the program currently live in 46 states.
MAT@USC students have the opportunity to exchange ideas and connect with other teachers nationwide looking to receive their masters of arts in teaching degree, which appeals to many students, DeMaria said.
“I loved hearing about educational issues from my cohort, my colleagues, all over the country,” DeMaria said. “So many of our issues in schools were the same but had a different … spin to them.”
The experience of getting to know one another is almost completely online, Klein said. The classrooms are video chat rooms with feeds of each student and the professor side by side on a grid.
“It’s a live feed,” Klein said. “Everyone jokes that it’s like The Brady Bunch.”
Though the program is online, the quality of the instruction is the same, she said.
“We pay very close attention to who we hire,” Klein said. “We don’t just hire Joe from across the street. This program is composed of USC faculty, developed by USC faculty, overseen by USC faculty.”
MAT@USC is also expanding, Klein said. They faculty already established Master of Arts in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages, a program for teachers who want to teach English, and on Sept. 13 they launched an international program.
“One thing I always remember our dean saying is that this is not your grandmother’s school of education,” Klein said. “We want people to be agents of change.”
Here’s a cool new nonprofit site that makes it easy to thank the teachers who got us where we are.  It just takes a second.

Who knew cheese could be juicy? The Obikà Mozzarella Bar in the Century City Westfield Mall is proving to new customers that juicy cheese can be pretty darn delicious despite the way it sounds.

Mozzarella di Bufala Experience – with the classic and affumicata Mozzarella di Bufala cheeses. - Photo courtesy of Wagstaff Worldwide, Inc.
The Mozzarella Bar opened Sept. 15, but it’s one of 13 restaurants in the international Obikà chain that boasts locations in Tokyo, New York and, of course, Italy.
Despite the fact that the Century City Obikà is located between a bookstore and a dress shop, it manages to create a comfortable and classy atmosphere.
Its modern design is inviting, with walls lined with wine bottles and a striking chalkboard displaying information about the restaurant’s signature mozzarella.
A few large communal tables create a family feel right away. The rest of the restaurant is set in tables for two or four, making it a great place for an interesting first date.
The long, sleek open bar processes most of the dishes — instead of the actual kitchen — and one can see the cheese floating in bowls of  water right upon walking into Obikà.
There weren’t more than two or three empty seats in the restaurant on the night of Sept. 18 but it didn’t feel crowded. Tables weren’t so close that you could eat your neighbor’s dinner — though neighboring tables were eager to see what everyone else  ordered.
Since Obikà opened recently, no one was a “regular” and no one had any set recommendations as far as what to order — not even the waiter, who, although friendly, was slow and generally uninformative.
Appetizers are simple and scarcely seen on tables. Salads, served in glass mixing bowls, were described as “a bunch of lettuce” according to the couple at the next table. Opting for cheese instead of  lettuce isn’t an incredibly difficult choice at a mozzarella bar anyway.
Obikà’s cunzato bread offerings remain a mystery. True carb-o-holics will revel in the special bread section on the menu, but if you’re expecting a bruschetta-like dish when ordering something bread-related, you’re at the wrong place.
Cunzato bread seemed a mystery to the employees at Obikà too, who said that it was “just like your grandmother would make” or “like cornbread but not corn, but it’s baked specially for us.”
Whatever cunzato bread is, it’s not very appealing. With the texture of a crumbly dry muffin soaked in something, even the tomato, olive, caper and cheese topping couldn’t save the bread. It leaves diners longing for the crunch of a baguette.
Main courses are largely vegetarian and of course involve cheese. Spinach and ricotta ravioli seemed like a sure bet but although the filling was rich and definitely delicious, an overly hard pasta killed the dish’s potential.
The true star is the Mozzarella di Buffala Campana, which is imported from Italy three times a week and has the status of denomination of protected origin. This means the European Union guarantees and protects its local production in the Campania region of Italy.
At Obikà, one can order the Mozzarella di Buffala Experience, a platter that lets you try a bit of everything, or a la carte. The mozzarella comes in three variations: classica (delicate), affumicata (smoked) or stracciatella di burrata (sweet and creamy). Sides and accompaniments include various types of cured meats and salamis, grilled vegetables and pestos. The meats balance nicely with smooth creamy cheeses and the vegetables fail to assert themselves, but the real flavor lies in the basil pesto, which is delicious enough to lick out of the bowl.
Then there is the juicy cheese. It’s soft, but not overly so, and has the distinctly sweet taste of mozzarella. It’s also chewy, moist and absolutely nothing like the hard mozzarella sold at the grocery store. Although the classica is definitely the way to go for those less adventurous, the sweet and creamy is very delicate, to the point of liquidity, and does not overwhelm the pallet.  Smoked cheeses have a decidedly more pungent flavor, which might be too strong for a person who isn’t a cheese connoisseur. Most customers preferred the classica for its simply great taste.
The cheese even comes in rolls, with different types of meats or lettuce between thin layers. A smoked wild Alaskan salmon and arugula mozzarella roll was the favorite of the night with the smoky deep flavored fish complimenting the tangy, pure cheese perfectly.
Even though the service was slow and it seemed all of the employees in the restaurant hadn’t quite figured it out yet, the bread was mediocre, and the entrée left a bit to be desired, the mozzarella is worth a return trip if nothing else. Would someone crave Obikà? It’s hard to say. But that juicy cheese was so darn good.
Thank you for your review.
Just opened and improving our speed in service on a day per day basis.
We already have changed the bread.

The 2010 Honda Civic Tour is over, but it went out with a bang Sunday night at the Honda Center. With an electrifying 18-song set, Paramore proved that it can not only headline shows in large arenas but blow the roof off, as well.
Opening the show was Kadawatha, a new band from Sweden, which performed well and injected a good amount of energy into its songs. Front man Daniel Kadawatha, however, only addressed the crowd once throughout the set, which seemed odd.
Pop-punk veteran New Found Glory went next and definitely knew how to work a crowd, even though it was not headlining. Fists flew into the air as the band members stormed the stage (after Miley Cyrus’ “Party in the USA” blared over the speaker system) and broke into “Truck Stop Blues” off its latest record Not Without a Fight.
Nick Mindicino | Daily Trojan
Of course, the last night of any tour means one thing: pranks while bands are playing. New Found Glory had to play with a Justin Bieber music video behind it instead of its usual banner. Kadawatha got doused with water during its set by Paramore guitarist Taylor York. Fortunately, New Found Glory did not let the video of Bieber add too much of a pop slant to its set as it blazed through old and new songs alike that included “Hit or Miss” and “Don’t Let Her Pull You Down,” before closing with fan favorite “My Friends Over You.”
Tegan and Sara followed, performing their brand of folk rock well and with sincerity. Following New Found Glory, however, they seemed to deflate the energy and the two bands should have swapped spots on the bill to create a better flow. They, too, were susceptible to pranks: During their performance of “Walking with a Ghost,” other members of the tour, such as Paramore’s vocalist Hayley Williams, stampeded the stage dressed as ghosts.
After Tegan and Sara concluded their set with “Hop a Plane,” it was time to wait for the five-piece Paramore to finally take the stage. As the lights went down, a curtain dropped down in front of the stage, on which the silhouettes of Paramore appeared as the band members broke into an instrumental introduction.
Then the curtain fell and a light show began as the band members revved the crowd up with “Ignorance,” the first single from 2009’s Brand New Eyes. Williams, York, lead guitarist Josh Farro, bassist Jeremy Davis and drummer Zac Farro kept the energy as they burst into “Feeling Sorry,” during which they stopped in the bridge in order for Williams to work everyone up into a raucous frenzy.
After a powerful performance of “Decode,” the lights dimmed and Williams appeared at the side of the stage to declare that the band was about to pay homage to its hometown with a cover of a Loretta Lynn’s country song, “You Ain’t Woman Enough To Take My Man.” Joined by Farro on acoustic guitar, they performed the touching rendition before rejoining their bandmates for an acoustic mini-set that included “When It Rains,” “Where The Lines Overlap” and “Misguided Ghosts.”
Before they played “Where the Lines Overlap,” Williams expressed Paramore’s tremendous gratitude to the fans for making the members’ career possible.
“I remember playing the Chain Reaction here in Anaheim,” Williams said. “And this place we’re in now is like 56 Chain Reactions. I never would have dreamed we’d be here, and it’s all because of you guys.”
Just because the band members indulged in some slow songs did not mean that their energy dwindled. In fact, as they broke into “Crushcrushcrush,” they began to make the show energetic once again before ending gracefully with a sparkling backdrop to the ballad “The Only Exception.”
The screams for an encore were deafening until Paramore reappeared on stage to play “Brick By Boring Brick.” Joined by various members of all the bands on tour (most notably members of Kadawatha, who began ballroom dancing), Paramore played one last song — its breakout hit, “Misery Business” — before a deluge of confetti rained down.
Paramore is a young band that has matured a lot over its six-year career, and its stage setup recalled all three of its albums. It is uncertain when Paramore will return to the L.A. area, but what is certain is that, as long as Williams remains frontman, things are only looking up from here.
Another great article from Mr. Mindicino. Keep em’ coming!
Sounds like this was an amazing night! Bummed that I missed it, but the article sums it up pretty nicely. I will definitely try to make it the next time Paramore is out here in LA!
The show was incredible!  Kadawatha’s front man has this piercingly clear and clean voice, New Found Glory played “Vegas” with Hayley Williams on bass, Tegan and Sara were amazing, but Paramore, they were definitely the stars.  Their performance was just spectacular.  I don’t think that they could have ended the night any better than they did with their encore performance.  Next time they are in the area, I will definitely be there.
Awesome!!!

The USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy chose a new chairman and added three new members to its board of advisers, a move that is designed to increase the center’s charitable power and sustainability.   
The center, whose mission statement says it aims to be a “catalyst for understanding and action at the intersection of the public, private and nonprofit sectors,” proposes new members via its nominating committee, which recommends a list of candidates to the dean. The dean then appoints new members.  
The new additions this year include Margo Leonetti O’Connell, president and trustee of the Leonetti O’Connell Family Foundation; Lisa Fredricks Parker, president and executive director of the Lawrence Welk Family Foundation; and Trent Stamp, executive director of The Eisner Foundation.
The board’s new chair, Fred J. Ali, serves as the president and chief executive officer of the Weingart Foundation, one of Southern California’s oldest and most well-known nonprofits for the underrepresented and homeless.
New board members serve a renewable three-year term and provide connections to philanthropic and non-profit organizations, help to shape and inform the board’s intellectual agenda, and work to grow the center’s reach and impact.   
The center holds several forums and roundtables, convening key decision makers from the non-profit and community sectors to explore emerging issues, discuss research findings and consider strategies for action. Additionally, they hold several speaker series and seminars to examine contemporary issues facing the three sectors of focus.
Clarification: 10/2/10: New board chair Fred Ali is still the president and chief executive officer of the Weingart Foundation; a previous version of the story misidentified Mr. Ali as the former president and chief executive officer. This entry has been updated to reflect the change.

A new polling location near campus has been approved by the Office of the Registrar in an effort to make voting more convenient for students who live on campus.
Hot ballot · The fire station on Jefferson Boulevard will serve as a polling place in November for students living in Webb Tower, Fluor Tower, Parkside and Cardinal Gardens. - Hayden Bennett | Daily Trojan 
Instead of having to travel more than a mile to Roger Williams Baptist Church on Adams Boulevard in order to vote, students living in Parkside apartments, Webb Tower, Fluor Tower and Cardinal Gardens apartments will be able to vote at the fire station on Jefferson Boulevard between McClintock and University avenues.
“[The fire station] was chosen because of its close proximity to a number of student housing complexes,” said Kerstyn Olson, deputy director of the Unruh Institute of Politics. “It’s more convenient for students.”
The fire station was the best option to make voting easier for students who live close to the station, as well as community members nearby, she said.
“The fire station has been a polling location before … it’s now become a possibility again,” said Micah Scheindlin, political director of USC College Democrats, who protested to the Registrar’s Office about the inconvenience of voting for on-campus students. “Because some of the precinct is off-campus, they prefer an off-campus location, and the fire station is convenient for students but is also off campus.”
Marks Tower will remain a polling location for those designated to vote there, but the Catholic Center, which in the past also served as a polling place for a number of students, won’t be available this year because of renovations.
“They’re creating a new polling place in lieu of the Catholic Center, which will be under construction,” Olson said.
That temporary polling location could be just north of campus at the Hillel Jewish Center at USC.
Because Hillel was still under negotiations as a voting location, Olson said it isn’t definite yet.
In finding this temporary polling location, the registrar was looking for a location in the same precinct as the Catholic Center, which would still be easily accessible to students.
The registrar plans to keep the fire station a permanent voting fixture.
“Some people may ask why we can’t use one polling location for all of campus,” Scheindlin said. “The reason is that the campus is divided into two precincts, and if you live on the west side of campus, you’ll actually be getting a slightly different ballot from the east side.”
Ballots and polling places depend on the county supervisor of each district, and — because the district line is drawn through campus — there are numerous polling places around USC.
Although the USC College Republicans weren’t involved in creating the new polling place near campus, chairwoman Katherine Cook said she is happy to know students have more options when it comes to getting their votes in.
“We commend College Democrats for their efforts to make the polling station accessible to students,” Cook said.

A student was struck by a vehicle while riding her bike across Adams Boulevard north of the University Park Campus Monday morning, according to the Department of Public Safety.
The female student was crossing Adams Boulevard while traveling southbound at 8:07 a.m. on Portland Street when she was hit.
She was transported to California Hospital shortly after the accident for treatment, said DPS Capt. David Carlisle. Her condition was not known at the time of publication.
The student did not yield to traffic before crossing, Carlisle said.
“The student was wearing headphones and talking on a cell phone and entered the intersection,” he said.
The Los Angeles Police Department is currently conducting a traffic collision investigation.
It saddens me to read this type of article as a fellow biker. However I do feel that bikers have a responsibility to “operate their vehicles ” cautiously  and adhere to the rules of the road, the same has other vehicles. I also feel that wreckless or uncourteous behavior on bikes is increasing around and throughout our campus. I hope that this issue is addressed at some point to prevent further accidents from happening.

Faced with the possibility of reduced bike access and storage on campus, student group SC for Alternative Transportation has dedicated its efforts to making sure students never find out what a bike-free campus could look like.
Wrong turn · SC for Alternative Transportation suggests that USC install bike paths on campus. Campuses such as UCSB have more than seven miles of bike paths and 10,000 parking spaces. - James Watson | Daily Trojan 
SCAT co-president Rachel Finfer, a senior majoring in policy, management and planning, said her organization views the university’s current actions as unnecessary and irrational.
In a bicycle safety forum last week, Charlie Lane, associate senior vice president for Career and Protective Services, presented recommendations to ensure safety for bicyclists and pedestrians on the main parts of campus.
Lane said one option is banning bikes on Trousdale Parkway and Childs Way between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Some of the rationale behind eliminating Trousdale’s bike racks lies with the university’s concern for aesthetics, Lane said.
Alumni and donors found the racks unappealing and recommended their removal, he said.
“We will bring alternative policies to the Department of Public Safety and the administration,” Finfer said.
Senior co-president Charlie Furman, a cinema-televison critical studies major, fears pushing bikes to the periphery will increase congestion, accidents and theft.
“I don’t want to see an increase in accidents because of a higher concentration of bikes,” he said.
Finfer says the best way to protect campus pedestrians from dangerous bikers is not to ban bike riding but to educate students about safe biking habits. SCAT plans to develop an online bike safety  course with this goal in mind.
“Bikes are efficient and safe,” Finfer said. “Bike racks can be painted and you can make them pretty.”
According to Finfer, the course will discourage bikers from multitasking while weaving through pedestrians and cars.
At the forum, Lane suggested implementing mandatory pre-orientation bike courses like AlcoholEdu and perhaps making bike safety classes a requirement for students who commit bike violations.   
Furman also stressed the importance of efficient infrastructure.
He said SCAT suggests the university provide better facilities for parking and riding bikes on campus.
SCAT is currently discussing solutions with graduate students from the USC School of Policy, Planning, and Development about improving conditions for bikers.
SCAT also envisions the development of bike paths to separate pedestrians and bicyclists.
“You can fit all these bikes in a small area; other schools do,” said Robert Foster, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering and a member of SCAT. “The key is organization. You just have to separate pedestrians from bikers.”
Many universities across the country offer bike paths and secure parking places to students. The League of American Bicyclists recognized UC-Santa Barbara this year for having more than seven miles of paved bike paths and more than  10,000 bicycle parking spaces.
Infrastructure and education are the two cornerstones SCAT will focus on while looking at  the university’s actions. The organization plans to hold an emergency meeting Wednesday to discuss the issue.
 
UCSB’s bike paths are terrible. I saw more accidents and congestion during the only year I was there than I ever have at USC. Keep it the same, it’s nice
Oh come on. Look, I know how rude some bicyclists can be and I’m all for enforcing a course or something that students must pass to bike on campus, but to complain about the racks is really silly. Yes, USC is a beautiful campus, but the key word here is “campus”. Seeing bikes parked outside buildings at a college is very normal. If anything, we need more racks so that bikes don’t spill out into the sidewalk when people don’t have a place to put them. THAT, I can agree, needs to be rectified.
I’m all for a bike ban. I broke my collarbone this summer which causes me a great deal of pain when walking, I have to wear a sling which makes it VERY obvious I am injured. I have been hit my bicyclist not once, not twice but THREE times. Not only are the majority of the bicyclist rude, but the bike racks are a disgrace to USC. USC looks like the place where bikes come to die, we have thousands of god awful, disgusting bikes littering campus. USC is a beautiful campus, don’t let these selfish people ruin it!!
There’s got to be a compromise here. I agree that many students don’t respect the rules of the road when it comes to biking and that it’s a wonder there are not more accidents. However, this is a college and bikes are an excellent means of alternate transportation, one that I depend on every day. The whole student body shouldn’t have to suffer because of bad bicyclists. Why not repeal the bike ban and instead require a course for all students to complete that details bike safety and have stricter penalties for things like violating pedestrians’ right of way and riding on the wrong side of the traffic?
These students have no idea on whats going on around them. They ride across the street on their bikes on to on coming traffic!! Really?! Yes If you were to stand out by gate 4 on Jefferson and Royal when cars are trying to leave you’ll see students just ride on the wrong side like its nothing skateboards included. Something needs to be done about this. I’m all for a bike ban just because students don’t know how to ride and pay attention at the same time. Then when they got off their bike they’ll just leave it anywhere. I was at gate 5 last week, and a student got off their bike and left it in the middle of the pathway on McClintock on the narrow side so you had people that had to walk out into the street just to get around the bike. So I took the bike and moved it around the corner out of the way so people could walk by. You’ll see kids on bikes that will not stop at stop signs and the only way they will stop is if a car is coming and looks as if its not going to stop. Yes this is college and yes this is the real world so why when students come on to campus they feel like they are no longer in the real world?
It’s about time someone is taking on the University’s ridiculous policies on bike riding.  Everyone knows that the only thing the bike bans are doing is increasing the traffic on the smaller paths, and wasting more money on all the useless DPS officers yelling at people.  And since when are bike racks ugly?  This is a goddam COLLEGE!  Deal with it.

The film is set in a dystopian vision of present-day England, where human cloning has been practiced since the 1950s and the doomed doubles are harvested for limbs and vital organs. Even more chillingly, clones are raised in sequestered boarding schools where they are indoctrinated with the belief that their short life expectancy and eventual submission to “completion centers,” where they will be slowly butchered, is normal.
Though this horrific fate is never spoken of in such blunt terms, the promise of it hangs over the moors and city like a shroud, its greater implications known only to the audience.
Katrina MacGregor | Daily Trojan
Kathy (Carey Mulligan), Tommy (Andrew Garfield) and Ruth (Keira Knightley), whom we first meet in their youth, are no exceptions to this institutional genocide, but their school, a creaky country manor called Hailsham, whispers unspoken possibilities. Full of doting instructors such as Miss Emily (Charlotte Rampling), whose sharp tongue masks tangible empathy, the students are instructed to produce work for an art gallery whose purpose remains unclear to the young artists until the end of their lives.
As the film jumps through the decades at an unfortunately impatient pace to the protagonists’ grim ends, friendships and relationships are formed and broken. While Tommy and Ruth loudly have sex upstairs, we are treated to Kathy’s shattered face, paralyzed with a desire that has not even seemed to be a possibility until this moment.
There are images and scenes of startling power and beauty to be found in Never Let Me Go, many of which one would imagine Ishiguro himself would be moved by. Romanek and screenwriter Alex Garland have managed to preserve the discord between the complicit audience and the protagonists marching toward their fate, with the blindfold coming loose only near the end.
When the audience finally sees what happens to one of these poor souls in gruesome detail, the movie presents one of the few scenes in recent memory that has so grimly depicted the dehumanization of an entire society.
And yet, for all of the film’s shattering bursts of anguish, it is shockingly unconfident. Romanek’s background in music videos might explain why the film is punctuated with gratuitous overtures by composer Rachel Portman, which ruin moments that would have been better left in contemplative, uncomfortable silence. Every time the film slows down and begins to reach as far into the rafters of the human spirit as the works of Resnais or Malick, Romanek scores and cuts as though attached to a defibrillator.
It is especially sad to see the potential for a great film go to waste away when one considers the talents of Mulligan and Garfield, both of whom give fearless, stirring performances. Garfield, a newcomer who proved himself in recent works like Boy A and Red Riding: 1975  is especially notable. Though Mulligan’s Kathy remains our eyepiece to Ishiguro and Romanek’s England, it is Garfield’s journey from complacency to love to anger that captures our sympathies in a quiet, understated performance that unsettles and moves deeply. When he finally explodes with despair, Romanek betrays his actor’s display with more strings from Portman.
Indeed, the ultimate tragedy of Never Let Me Go is not the harvesting of life but the loss of a timeless picture.
Perhaps Romanek was unnerved by what he has captured and whether audiences could take it. Here an image as simple as a modernist apartment complex terrifies in its allusion to man’s advancement in technology, an ascension that has proved itself both decadent and murderous. That alone constitutes a competent, fearless picture, which remains just as distant here as a lifetime of love and companionship.

Dan Blanck, a sophomore majoring in music industry, is a Bob Dylan fanatic. It’s uncharacteristic to see Blanck without a guitar case in hand, singing “Blood on the Tracks” under his breath. Record label co-founder Blanck shares more than lyrical depth and songwriting style with the folk-rock hero. They share a common dream.
In the film Up In The Air, Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) asks Bob (J.K. Simmons) a question that deserves more reflection.
“You know why kids love athletes?” Bingham asks.
“Because they screw lingerie models,” Bob retorts.
“No,” Bingham says. “Kids love them because they follow their dreams.”
In college, and throughout our formative years, we all have our respective idols: painters, filmmakers, musicians, athletes, authors, entrepreneurs or rebels. There is a connection between us and those we study, read about and admire. Through their success, ours is rendered more tangible.
Blanck’s story, although punctuated by various internships and business endeavors, is more like a Wes Anderson film full of people and life.
“My music career has been fueled by a combination of mentors and teachers, traveling and observing the world,” Blanck said. “Around the age of 9, at summer camp, I heard Bob Dylan for the first time. His storytelling inspired me to buy my first guitar.”
Anecdotes aside, the difference between Blanck and many people his age is that the 19-year-old co-founded an independent recording label Acadian Recording Co. with actor Spencer Breslin (The Santa Clause 2 and 3, Disney’s The Kid) and is well on his way to creating a career in music.
In 2005, Blanck launched Blanck Records in upstate New York, where he maintained engineer-to-artist relationships with the Metropolitan Opera and Symphony, Grammy-nominated recording artists and jazz ensembles. He also worked for studios and concert halls, including Belfer Archives and Crouse Recital Hall at Syracuse University. Furthermore, Blanck won multiple Downbeat Awards in 2007 and 2008, a music award given to students annually.
When I asked Blanck if he was afraid of what happens when he leaves college and enters the real world, he told me that the world he inhabits now may be comfortable, but it’s still real.
“Although my family sometimes refers to USC as summer camp,” Blanck said. “[It] provides learning opportunities. I would like to think I am in the real world now.”
This is a fair statement for Blanck to make, given what he does beyond USC. College provides a certain amount of security, but there is still failure, discrimination, conflict and loss. What Blanck teaches us is that we need to not only educate ourselves but also put what we learn to good use.
In the arts, there has always been a movement against the mainstream, and for good reason. Studios tend to micro-manage, record labels put brands and identity before voice and talent and revenue is the paramount. The stigma associated with anyone working in that realm in a larger capacity is sell out.
Successful people are often categorized in this way, while the downtrodden auteur remains part of the artistic nobility. Although the term “sell out” is wildly thrown about, that fame that comes with it can be corruptive. But to say that any actor working on a studio blockbuster or a musician premiering a video on VH1 is automatically a sell out is not always accurate.
Spike Jonze made commercials before becoming the renowned indie filmmaker that he is today.
When Blanck is recording some mainstream group in his recording studio, is he not a dream maker? If we are doing what we love every single day, how could we be selling out?
For the past few weeks I’ve talked about dreams, but it occurs to me that I might not have made clear exactly what it means to be a “dream maker” as opposed to a “dreamer.” In the real world, dreams are not found, they are achieved. And for Blanck, the idea of owning a record company is almost a complete realization of a dream. Blanck not only hoped to work in the music industry but filed and negotiated for a legal stake.
This might seem contradictory because dreams tend to be thought of in a purified state where business and profits cease to exist. But when our dreams, identities, ideals and investments are allowed to harmonize, that is a kind of music too, isn’t it?
Brian Ivie is a sophomore majoring in cinema-television critical studies. His column, “Dreammaking,” runs Tuesdays.
Last name ever, first name greatest.
If you spell Daniel Blanck in Scrabble, you win. Forever.
Eloquently written and truly describes the creative impetus of Daniel.
We should all “Strive to be Blanck”
Great article. Daniel Blanck is a legend!

While everyone else parties it up at bars or eats pumpkin pie yogurt at a fro-yo shop, writers are laboring over their stories. Then, after hours of labor, the masterpiece is finally finished. Now what?
Proud publisher · C.B. Shiepe’s newest publication became a big seller at Vromans in Pasadena and Book Soup in West Hollywood. - Photo courtesy of C.B. Shiepe , photo taken by Pam McComb   
C.B. Shiepe, a USC alumnus and the author of the novel Cliff Falls — a current bestseller at Vroman’s in Pasadena and Book Soup in West Hollywood — knows this story all too well. His novel is a revealing tale about “being comfortable with who you are when everyone else wants you to be someone else” Shiepe said.
Shiepe’s own tale of self-publishing his novel and its continued success through word-of-mouth is itself an inspiration and encouragement to any aspiring writer.
Cliff Falls tells the story of Clay Grant, a former child star of the fictional ’80s sitcom Little Guy Mike. The project first started out as a screenplay, then a television pilot and finally a novel. The process spanned nearly a decade, but for Shiepe, it was all worth it.
As any reader or writer knows, a hit book is not made by the story alone. Even what might seem a mere triviality has a huge impact on the quality of a book.
“The cover alone took six months,” Shiepe said.
Staying with his idea of a local book, he went to the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena and used the artwork of one of the school’s graduates for his cover.
“You would think typesetting is as easy as cut and paste,” he said. “But I have discovered it is an art unto itself.”
This art included learning everything about different publishing options, including offset printing, print on demand, distribution and promotion.
“The learning curve is steep,” he said. “You can’t imagine what goes into a book.”
For writers looking to sell their novels online there are two choices. One option is selling it on Amazon.com.
Shiepe considered that but decided it was “not very profitable until you’re selling large quantities.”
This led to another option — selling the book on his own website.
Although that method could potentially turn a profit, it would have left Shiepe with the problem of either filling the orders himself or hiring someone to do it.
The last option was to sell his book in chain stores such as Borders and Barnes & Noble. While these types of stores reach a wider venue, they can end in a huge loss of money.
“They could place an order of 2-3,000 books and send them back eight to 12 weeks later,” Shiepe said.
This means you just paid to print all those books, but wind up with them back in your basement as damaged inventory.
Shiepe ultimately took his manuscript to Vroman’s, southern California’s oldest and largest independent bookstore, which promptly put it on consignment.
When independent bookstores sell a book on “consignment,” it means they order a certain quantity of the books, and split the profit with the author.
The most economically sound way to publish a novel seems to be the way Shiepe is doing it. He likes to call it “a long-term, organic approach.”
And it is working. He has been asked to do three book signings at three chain stores even though his book wasn’t selling there.
So what’s C.B. Shiepe’s advice to all the aspiring writers?
“Don’t waste time wondering if you’re talented,” he said. “Just stay with it. Get solid feedback, but stay true to the vision you have and move on.”
Shiepe’s book was a page turner.  While I still struggle with faith in general, it helped me to believe that there is an answer for that, seemingly unquenchable, existential question.  I’m glad I read it and would encourage anyone else to who has a hunger for something real.
This book was an easy read, which is a good thing for those of us that are not prolific readers. Though the reading itself was light, the content was anything but! It’s refreshing to read a book that has a real story unlike so many things today that seem to be filled with, in my opinion, unneeded language and visuals just for effect. This story was written simply because that’s all it needed to get the story across. And what a story it was, it touched my heart.
I couldn’t put this book down! I read it in one sitting. I know it will touch many lives because it touched mine!

After the subtle nuances of hydro-allergenic aliens and evil trees, M. Night Shyamalan has gone back to scratch. Old Scratch, that is. Devil is Shyamalan’s take on what happens when Satan decides to get a head start on some naughty sinners.
Speak of the devil · Devil, co-developed by M. Night Shyamalan, follows five individuals with troubled pasts who end up trapped in a skyscraper elevator, unaware that one of members is not who he seems. - Photo courtesy of Universal Pictures  
For this film, M. Night Shyamalan has stepped out of the director’s chair, but kept his hands on the producer reins and came up with the concept for the story. Even if the film does not look like traditional Shyamalan, it feels like it. For those whose last Shyamalan outing involved Airbenders, this will give the opening credits an artificial sense of dread.
As we are told by our omniscient security guard narrator, the devil likes to round up a few of the already damned and stir up crazy shenanigans — all the while making sure he has an audience to witness the carnage. For this escapade, Satan channels his inner Jigsaw and traps five people in an elevator.
Inside the elevator, we have an old lady, a pretty lady, a smarmy mattress salesman, a puppy-eyed war veteran and a claustrophobic security guard. Outside the elevator is the building security team and the Philadelphia police led by troubled Detective Bowden, whose family tragedy has left him a religious cynic.
Despite the spiritual nature of the movie, we are spared a reprisal of Shyamalan’s humble role as Lady in the Water’s chosen messiah. The actual acting talent in the movie is little to write home about. However, it gets the job done, even if it is a rather boring job.
Talk to any 5-year-old and you will find there are plenty of mischievous things to do in an elevator. In Devil, it’s little more than flashing lights, shattered mirrors and perhaps a few inappropriate touches. Oh, and people start dying.
The rest of the film is split between our elevator victims going crazy and our detectives digging up a slew of convoluted subplots. Meanwhile, there’s just enough paranormal sparks to remind us that this is a horror film.
Director John Erick Dowdle tries hard to keep things tense and claustrophobic. Creative with the limited space of an elevator, he manages to keep the camera from becoming too static. The Hitchcockian soundtrack, also true to Shyamalan form, makes every trumpet-heavy effort to add drama. They really do try their best. The problem lies in the narrative.
Although Shyamalan did not write the screenplay, he crafted the story. It bears many of his overused, kitschy trappings — characters with spotty pasts, histories that predictably intertwine and earnest attempts at transcending horror and hitting some deep vein of human emotion. In this case, Shyamalan’s message to the world is taking responsibility for our actions and embracing forces beyond ourselves.
With all of this tightly crafted introspection, there’s little room for horror. There’s little room for just mild discomfort, except the awareness that boredom is setting in. That is the true devilry of the film — Devil is not god-awful, but it is very underwhelming.
Even a cheap horror film can spice up an hour and a half with jumpy startles and silly teenagers. Devil takes itself too seriously to resort to cheap scares, but never achieves the unsettling factor necessary to be an intellectual horror film. Neither Jigsaw nor Dr. Caligari would be amused.
M. Night Shyamalan had the chance to get really creepy. He’s using the devil, not some random alien or ghost. This is a character buried in many of our minds since childhood and already carries connotations and a backstory. He could have gone a different route and said something interesting and disturbing about the nature of evil and Satan among us. If anyone has read Paradise Lost or seen The Prophecy, Lucifer can be an interesting character by himself. But this Lucifer tops out at copping feels and rewiring elevators. Pretty lame for the caretaker of hell.
The backstories of the characters, and how they intertwine, could also have been more interesting. Instead, although they might not be predictable, they are hardly surprising . Though Shyamalan offers no aliens-who-are-allergic-to-water twists, the end of the film feels thoroughly arrived at and not as a result of solid storytelling.
Ultimately, the lesson we take from Devil is this: If your day seems like a string of random disasters, blame it on gremlins or fairies. The devil’s not boring enough for a movie this tepid.
I thought the movie was ok, not something I would buy or even rent but it was a definite forst date movie ( which is why i saw it ). Although it wasnt great it still deserved the creed of building the suspense and literally not knowing who was real and who was not ( watch the movie and u will know what i mean) I found alot of cultural irony in this film how the security guard the only black man in the movie had a violent past . Aside from that it was a ok film thereare still a few things they could clear though like who the guy was that jumped out of his office at the beginning and what significance his suicuide note held amoung other things i dont have time to spell out but aside from that this movie would get 2.5 out of 5
i think it was a great movie, how stubborn are these poeple, the death, the shattered mirrors are all the devils work.
m night did a great job on this ovie, in fact this will be my thrid time to go see it in less than a week.
Some reviewers seem unable to understand the films that they see: The hydrophobe aliens are an old cliché which is, combinde with the also phony corn circles merely used by writer/director Shyamalan in his film “Signs” as the MacGuffin for a tale fo fear and lost and regained faith. Nuances in that film are others: aluminum foil hats, the babyphone. Same with the neurotoxoc plants from “The Happening”: it’s a science fiction MacGuffin (btw, plants are really defending themselves with actovely spread toxines way against insects and other animals) for another tale of social disintegration. That’s all, folks! There are many other directors more deserving your bashing than this excentric, maybe selfcentered though talented mr. Syhamalan!
