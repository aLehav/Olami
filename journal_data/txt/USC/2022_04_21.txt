The School of Cinematic Arts said they are continuing to gather information about a vehicle accident involving three USC students and killing a Chapman University student, Dean Elizabeth Daley said in a statement Wednesday, following an initial email to the SCA community Monday. 
At 1:09 p.m. Friday, a 2022 Can-Am Maverick UTV carrying the four students “was traveling along the side of a sand dune when for reasons still under investigation, the Can-Am began overturning down the sand dune,” according to a California Highway Patrol news release. “All parties were wearing the proper safety equipment” except for the deceased, whom the CHP did not name. 
The accident occurred in the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area in Imperial County, some 230 miles southeast of campus. USC said in a separate statement that filming activity further than 50 miles from campus or involving off-road vehicles would have required explicit approval from the University. 
“We are unaware of any such approvals having been requested or provided in this tragic matter,” the statement read.
Stephen Galloway, dean of Dodge College of Film and Media Arts at Chapman University, identified the deceased as Peng Wang, a 29-year-old graduate student at Chapman who was working as a cinematographer for an SCA production. Wang, who resided in Walnut, was involved in award-winning films prior to his death — including the short “Daemon,” which won Best Drama Short at the 2020 Los Angeles Film Awards. (At time of publication, Galloway did not respond to requests for comment from the Daily Trojan.)
The surviving students, Bingliang Li — whom CHP identified as the driver of the vehicle — Ziyang Liu and Ting Su, are graduate students pursuing master’s degrees at SCA. 
In her Monday email, Daley said Chapman is “working with the family of the deceased student.” The Chinese Consulate of L.A. also said it will keep in touch with the family, Consulate Spokesman Gao Fei said to the Los Angeles Times. 
The University declined to comment on disciplinary action against the SCA students involved, writing in a statement to the Daily Trojan that “due to student privacy laws, we cannot comment on any pending student conduct matters.”
Attorneys representing the students said to the Los Angeles Times, “We think, before anybody makes any statements, that they should let the investigation play out.”

USC student organization TroyLabs, a venture platform for startups, hosted its sixth annual largest startup exhibition, DEMO — which showcases 50 USC startups, guest speaker panels, keynote speakers and pitch competitions — to provide Trojans with a pipeline to startup development. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Todd Gavin, vice president of BUILD, TroyLabs’ cohort-style accelerator program, said the organization hopes to raise awareness of the resources and opportunities they can supply to students who are interested in startups. The entrepreneurial scene at USC in comparison to other universities has lacked execution, Gavin said, which he believes can be nurtured at TroyLabs from “ground zero up to floor 100” so students can innovate and create with the help from a community dedicated to facilitating the dreams of visionary entrepreneurs.
Managing director of main event sponsor Lloyd Greif Center Monica Dean and President Carol Folt made opening remarks. The event then transitioned into the startup exhibition and a hackathon event at Tommy’s Place during the afternoon. Later on, the event hosted a founder fireside chat, pitch competition and ended with closing remarks. 
“I really just want to congratulate you: the people that run this, the students, the faculty that work on TroyLabs,” said Folt at the event. “This is wonderful. This is a fabulous place for you to learn these things, to think about all these issues, to meet all sorts of other entrepreneurs. You’ve learned from each other more than you’ll ever learn from anyone else, and it’s a wonderful example of how to bring forward creativity in everyone.”
Anthony Borquez, assistant professor of clinical entrepreneurship and event moderator, said to the audience — which included students, faculty, alumni and investors — that going above and beyond to create opportunities for oneself and networking with cohorts is necessary for the college experience and a chance to build an idea. Borquez also introduced the first guest speaker, cofounder of Tinder, Sean Rad.
“Entrepreneurs are really problem solvers,” Rad said. “They’re able to creatively pull together resources to create something new.”
Mitchell Morrison, cofounder of startup CarbonLink, said that Troy Labs’ consulting sessions — where students could talk with successful USC alumni about their experiences and input — featured helpful advice when they were developing their business model in the BUILD stage.  
“We would have entrepreneurs come three or four times a year that were really getting in the weeds on some of the harder problems [in creating startups] that were really helpful,” Morrison said. “TroyLabs has some of the smarter and more passionate people at USC and getting their one-on-one direct help was beyond impactful, both personally and for our company.”
When Rad launched his first company, Orgoo, a unified communication channel, at the age of 18, he had trouble understanding the technology needed to execute his idea. 
“I remember I scanned the engineering school at USC to look for someone who could build [my idea],” Rad said. “I would recruit engineers, but my focus has always been product design, storytelling, marketing and how it all comes together.” 
Rad added that in terms of funding, young entrepreneurs should think about what their company needs rather than trying to get funds because they can. Instead, having less money forces entrepreneurs to be creative and problem solve, Rad said. He noted entrepreneurs have created great companies without raising giant funds because they were “diligent” in asking themselves whether money would succinctly solve their problems.
“There’s something about scarcity that forces you to think out of the box, but I’ve seen a lot of companies fail because they have too much funds,” Rad said. “Nowadays, it’s like raising money is a badge of honor.”
The event marked DEMO’s in-person return after being online last year due to the pandemic. Parthsarthi Suri, president of TroyLabs, said the change would better foster community — both between founders and between founders and investors — to form bonds and make lasting connections. He also said that TroyLabs is aimed at facilitating relationships between founders of startups, who share unique problems that can be solved through communication and support.
“It’s a very positive sign, I would say,” said Raunak Moolchandani, a sophomore majoring in economics. “As a student who’s going to spend two more years at USC, seeing the entrepreneurial community grow is very exciting.”
The TroyLabs team put in a couple of months of work to prepare for DEMO, said Emy Li, the vice president of INVEST and a sophomore majoring in economics and applied and computational mathematics. 
“All of these moving parts coming together and just all the feedback we received after from founders, the guests, the students, just seeing that was really gratifying, and I’m just super super grateful to be part of such an amazing team,” Li said.
Suri said that, when he first became president, he set three main goals for TroyLabs: Making TroyLabs someone’s first thought when they think about anything entrepreneur-related, distinguishing TroyLabs globally and creating more diversity within the organization. Suri noted that while 50% of TroyLabs’ members are women, he thinks “it isn’t enough.”
“Next semester and onward, after finally going through this process myself, I really do want to focus on women founders and getting women involved in entrepreneurship and [venture capital],” Suri said.
For Sam Habibi, a senior business law consultant at TroyLabs who is a sophomore majoring in public policy, expectations for the exhibition were to connect the entrepreneurial community together on campus and to create a different environment where companies and individuals can network and learn from each other. He added that the diversity of students’ majors in the organization set TroyLabs apart from other clubs at USC.
“Since we’re so diverse, in terms of the things we’re studying and the things we’re passionate about, we all look at problems differently, and that really helps us to find the best way to attack all these problems,” Habibi said. “It’s just fascinating to see all these people from so many different backgrounds all come together around entrepreneurship … it’s kind of like a uniting factor that connects all of us together.”

The Undergraduate Student Government hopes to expand and progress on their sustainability initiatives in the 2022-23 year by advocating for recycling bins to be implemented on the Row and calling for a ban on single-use plastics. 
One of the sustainability projects USG advocated for over the 2021-22 year was talking to University administration about the elimination of single-use plastics, which recently gained ground with Chief Sustainability Officer Mick Dalrymple’s recent announcement that USC plans to eliminate single-use plastic bottles by July 1. 
Another project that USG’s sustainability committee has been working on with the Environmental Student Assembly, a USG programming assembly and the largest environmental student group on campus, over the 2021-22 year is a vegan and vegetarian digital cookbook that students and staff can use as a “starting point” for a green diet. The cookbook will be accessible on the ESA and USG websites when it is released next semester. The cookbook will be a living document that can be added to, former senator Russell Agustin said.
“A lot of our projects have been to bring more awareness of things that have been going on,” Agustin said. “If [the USG Sustainability Committee] can ensure that there’s more accessibility to that whole concept of environmental mindfulness, then we know that we’re on the right track, and we can always be better.” 
ESA is working with Generation Conscious, a BIPOC-owned laundry detergent brand that significantly reduces carbon emissions, to have their detergent sheets implemented in USC Housing.
ESA hopes to pilot the implementation of the detergent sheets next semester and currently has a petition to raise awareness about the detergent up on their Instagram, assistant director Connor Castillo said. The effects of common detergents often use plastic and water unsustainably.
“We just want to have as many names and then as many student group affiliations as possible to get admin to implement [the laundry detergent],” Castillo said. “It seems that we do have a lot of the administration’s support as far as the Office of Sustainability.”
Castillo said he expects some difficulty garnering the support of USC Housing for the initiative due to the high upfront costs associated with installing and financing substantial amounts of detergent regularly.
The sustainability committee has also been working with faculty and operations to implement a sufficient amount of trash bins in USC Libraries. The committee has also recently explored placing shoe bins at the Lyon Center next semester to create channels of donations of athletic footwear that can be redistributed to unhoused communities in the area. 
Senator Aidan Feighery is also looking to get more funding for student initiatives for sustainability, such as SC Garden Club, an organization that manages the Parkside Garden, a fully organic garden space. The club’s members, Feighery said, often use their own money to fund projects. 
“That should never be happening because it’s prohibitive toward the success of the initiative and also toward, like, if the student didn’t have that kind of money, then suddenly the initiative fails,” Feighery said. “The senate, because it does function somewhat as a funding party, is able to address that kind of concern.”
USG’s chief financial officer Adenike Mikende’s recently established Green Engagement Fund will financially support student programs, initiatives and projects that build community and culture through sustainability and environmental justice. 
USG chair of campus operations and sustainability nominee Sara Stienecker said she also hopes to have more sustainable forms of transportation available for students and said this can be accomplished by providing Metro passes to undergraduate students. USG senators will vote on her confirmation at next week’s senate meeting. 
“I feel like transportation is our angle [in our sustainability goals],” vice president Nivea Krishnan said. “What we’re hoping to get started is a shuttle between USC and LAX … that’s something we’ve talked to [President Carol Folt] about, and she would love for that shuttle to be electric, so we think that would be really cool.”

People perused showcased artists and sustainable food tastings flooded the yard in front of Bovard Auditorium Wednesday evening for USC’s Earth Week celebration. Students walking past on Trousdale Parkway could see the tables set up advocating for sustainability and environmental justice.
The celebration consisted of a Resource Fair, held outside the auditorium from 4:30 to 5:45 p.m., followed by speaker presentations from 6 to 7:30 p.m. The event featured Ron Finley, also known as the “Gangsta Gardener,” and the Arts & Climate Collective, a collection of student activists and artists involved in the movement for climate and environmental justice. 
The speaker part of the event began with a welcome from President Carol Folt, before continuing with presentations from the Arts & Climate Collective facilitated by Colin Maclay, a research professor of communication and an ACC faculty adviser. ACC members Jaime Lopez, a doctoral student studying urban planning and development and digital media and culture, Diana Salinas Vargas, a junior majoring in public policy and Eytan Stanton, a sophomore majoring in geodesign, spoke on their projects in the organization and their journeys in environmentalism. 
Following these presentations, Finley launched into his speech.
Finley began his work in 2010, driven by a goal to resolve the issue of forgotten patches of dirt within the neighborhood parkways of South Central Los Angeles. He began gardening then and fought for his community’s ability to plant and grow food. The region’s low access to fresh produce inspired him to use gardening as a tool to change lives.
“Food is a cornerstone of civilization,” Finley said. “We need to start saving our seeds and saving ourselves and saving the country. That’s what this whole thing’s about. We together must … redesign our communities.”
The idea to bring in Finley as the event’s guest speaker came from Alyssa Tan, a graduate student studying public policy and USC Office of Inclusion and Diversity’s diversity coordinator.
Tan said Finley felt like the right person to bring because he is “right in our backyard.”
“[Finley’s] story is such a powerful testimony to what can happen when people start where they are and believe in something and go about making it happen,” Tan said. 
After Finley’s speech, he, along with students from the ACC, led a conversation about increasing and broadening the impact of “artivism,” activism through art. The conversation was facilitated by the University’s Chief Inclusion and Diversity Officer Christopher Manning. The three students included were Irene Franco Rubio, a junior majoring in sociology; Hannah Flynn, a graduate student studying landscape architecture and urban planning and Imani Johnson, a USC alumna.
Franco Rubio, an organizer with Communities for a Better Environment through Dornsife’s Agents of Change program, complimented ACC as a great community to be a part of. 
“Everyone kind of has their own approach to environmental justice work,” Franco Rubio said. “Whether that be, in my case, creating a community podcast that I’ve started in Arizona and am working on, or in other student cases, doing artwork.”
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Manning said students should be curious about ways to further connect with sustainability in L.A. 
“There are so many justice-oriented sustainability movements in L.A. and Southern California,” Manning said. “Learn what’s out there and try to find something that matches your heart’s desire to make an impact, and, when you find it, throw yourself in.”

This review contains spoilers. 
“Petite Maman,” which translates to “little mother” from French, is a phenomenal follow-up from writer and director Céline Sciamma after 2019’s “Portrait of a Lady on Fire.” Soft and elegant, the film narrates the story of a little girl named Nelly (Joséphine Sanz), who is dealing with the loss of her grandmother with her mother (Nina Meurisse) and father (Stéphane Varupenne). As Nelly’s mother mourns the loss of her own mother and packs up her childhood home, she eventually leaves to grieve on her own, leaving her husband and daughter to clean out the home together. 
While Nelly wanders the surrounding woods, she meets another girl named Marion (Gabrielle Sanz), and the two become friends. The girls are strikingly similar, given the characters are being played by twins. The casting for these two characters serves a wonderful purpose. Not only are their performances extremely well done individually but also the natural comfortability between the girls makes the energy of the film much closer and more touching. As “Petite Maman” progresses and the narrative unpacks, the familiarity of Marion for Nelly transcends beyond just their similarities in facial features — Marion turns out to be Nelly’s mother. 
A story with time travel elements such as this one often feels as if it should be reserved for pieces with an abundance of CGI or editing. However, Sciamma delivers the tale in a new, fascinating way, one that is tender and minimalist. What feels similar to a large budget science fiction movie instead breaks emotional barriers and connects with the viewer in a special way. Watching it resembles uncovering an old, dusty fairytale book only to find that it’s brimming with the brightest stories. 
Sciamma’s range is notable, considering the shifts in tone from previous stories such as “Portrait of a Lady on Fire,” “Tomboy” (2011) or “Water Lilies” (2007), yet her films do share similar themes of girlhood and womanhood. Her vision of childhood shows a deep appreciation for reflection and naturalism. According to Sciamma, much of her influence came from renowned artist and cofounder of Studio Ghibli, Hayao Miyazaki, so much so that she found herself asking, “What would Miyazaki do?” as she went along the creative process. Sciamma’s ability to translate the character’s experiences and emotions in a way that deeply connects with the audience is certainly a huge strength and contribution to the film’s success. With a fairly short run time of 72 minutes, “Petite Maman” is, in fact, petite but delivers the story of Nelly trying to understand her mother perfectly. Sciamma says in 72 minutes what some can’t say in hours. 
The cinematography, small and simple — as the title may suggest — fits the narrative like a glove. Grandiosity is unnecessary in this story, and cinematographer Claire Mathon, who collaborated with Sciamma previously on “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” and also worked on Pablo Larraín’s “Spencer,” shows this thorough intimate lighting and warm, earthy autumnal tones. While many scenes take place in a forest, the audience can feel the leaves and wind surrounding them. It is almost as if the audience is there with Nelly and Marion amongst the trees, experiencing life through their eyes. However, it is certainly not a traditional coming-of-age story. While parts of the film certainly fit this mold, others feel plucked directly from a world of fantastical elements or a ghost story. It’s not overwhelming, scary or absurd but rather comforting. 
One thing is for certain, this film should be watched with a box of tissues at hand. Whether one can understand Nelly or Marion, Sciamma’s painting of intergenerational conflict between parents and children through the eyes of an eight-year-old is touching and beautiful. The French filmmaker once again proves that she is able to reach the sublime with her work. 
Previously nominated for a number of awards, including a BAFTA and the Golden Berlin Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival, “Petite Maman” will be released in the United States April 22 in theaters.

I’ve never had a desire to go to Coachella. Thinking of paying hundreds of dollars to spend hours in the desert wearing an impractical (albeit beautiful) outfit is, quite honestly, the last thing I’d want to spend any of my time doing. 
But recently, I’ve gotten close to changing my anti-Coachella mindset. As always, the reasoning behind my new thought process is rooted in K-pop. 
SM Entertainment’s latest girl group, aespa, was announced as a main stage performer for Coachella’s second weekend on Monday, making them the third ever K-pop group to perform at the festival and the first to perform on the event’s main stage.  
It’s a move that shocked me, but it’s also one that I really should have seen coming. 
As established in previous installments of my column, K-pop holds its roots in capitalism. Recently, many groups have aimed to achieve their financial goals by targeting fans around the globe, specifically through the American music industry. With so much promotion such as English singles and U.S. exclusive album pre-order benefits — targeted toward an American audience, it makes sense that the next move for K-pop groups is to perform at high-visibility American events. We saw this when aespa and labelmate NCT 127 performed at Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, BTS at the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball Tour and, now, Coachella. 
Despite my qualms with the possibility of K-pop groups  sacrificing their culture for Western validation (and I still don’t support that), I really have no issues with U.S.-specific promotions of the songs they’re pushing domestically. In fact, I actually really like them. Not only do they give me increased access to goods and events related to my favorite groups, but the group also represents a growing amount of support for Korean acts abroad, a recent phenomenon I support rather wholeheartedly. 
Yet, something feels different — and perhaps even more special — about aespa’s upcoming Coachella stage. Even though they’re not the first to perform at the festival — BLACKPINK did in 2019 and 2NE1 surprised fans with a reunion last weekend — they are the first to perform on the festival’s main stage. BLACKPINK’s performance attracted thousands to the festival’s side Sahara stage, and 2NE1 performed during member CL’s set, who attended the festival through her partnership with Asian record collective 88rising.
In no way is the honor undeserved. In the mere two years since the four-member group, consisting of Karina, Giselle, Winter and Ningning, debuted, their third single, “Next Level,” won Record of the Year at the Melon Music Awards and was one of 2021’s biggest songs on YouTube Music in South Korea. The group also served as a brand ambassadors for Korean makeup brand CLUBCLIO and global ambassadors for French luxury fashion brand Givenchy. 
To me, however, the significance of aespa’s performance on the main stage, rather than a side stage or in partnership with other acts, should not be overlooked. This feat represents more than validation of aespa’s accomplishments as a group, but even more so of the American music industry’s recognition of the genre they represent.
Coachella, one of the most renowned music festivals in the world, attracts up to 125,000 attendees per day and brings artists of a myriad of genres together to perform in a beautiful Southern California desert. These artists range from Top 40 frequenters like Harry Styles and The Weeknd to up-and-coming acts like Jean Dawson and Channel Tres. And, it’s without question that an overwhelming majority of these artists are based in the U.S. or produce music in English. 
Aespa’s invitation to perform not just at the festival but on its main stage is a clear acknowledgment of the K-pop music industry. By uplifting the voices and performances of these acts that fall outside of the American music industry’s typical demographic, Coachella gives K-pop groups a shot at entering a new demographic. Moreover, it gives them a platform to showcase their performances to exponentially more people  who probably would have never otherwise listened to their music. In this way, Coachella is a unique vehicle that can propel the K-pop groups to the — no pun intended — next level. 
Yet, it’s clear that this exchange is mutual. Following the announcement, aespa fans, or MYs, trended “AESPA AT COACHELLA” globally, and the group announced its plans to perform unreleased tracks, including, “Life’s Too Short,” which will be performed fully in English — a strategy that will ensure MYs around the world never stop discussing this weekend’s performance.
Aespa’s inclusion is important because it not only will it exponentially benefit aespa’s members and their fanbase, but even more so, it symbolizes a necessary shift of K-pop into mainstream media. At this rate, maybe my trek to the desert will come sooner than I thought.

From a young age, singing has been second nature for Elly Shane. Since the age of two, Shane, a sophomore majoring in music industry, maintained impeccable pitch, and from there, she passionately pursued every opportunity to sing — at church, school performances and the professional level. After working with fellow USC students, Shane plans to show off her developing artistry with her debut EP “Tripwire.”  
Including previously released singles “Sense of Gravity” (of which the music video received over 21,000 views on YouTube) and “Enemies,” “Tripwire” — releasing April 22 — is a collaborative project with friend and producer Ryan Baer, a sophomore majoring in music industry. In their dorm rooms between classes, the EP is a final product of their tireless daily writing and recording sessions. 
“We hit the ground running when we moved in August,” Shane said. “We started working everyday on the EP. And so, I’d go to class, and then come back, and we would have a writing session. And then I would record and edit, and go to class, and homework and edit.” 
Combined with Baer’s futuristic and alternative R&B and hip hop beats and Shane’s rich vocals, “Tripwire” reflects influences of ’90s R&B elements and artists such as Brandy, Rihanna and Snoh Aalegra. Pushing the boundaries of various styles, Shane and Baer imagined “Tripwire” as a visual narrative that shows off Shane’s vocal versatility and personality. The tracklist is an emotional exploration of breaking away from the past and reaching for new connections. 
Shane notes that the “Sense of Gravity,” the first track of the EP, is “home for [her] as an artist” because she loved the beat. Pairing the beat with conversational lyrics such as, “If you’re beaten down feeling lonely / Don’t think of her, think about me instead,” this song ssuspends the listener in a plush headspace woven by Shane’s rich vocals and Baer’s futuristic production. 
“He’s Not You/Safeword” might be the most captivating track of the EP, with its soft ballad beginning that gradually builds with resounding R&B beats and ends with a flourishing electric guitar solo. Shane said that this song was the most difficult for them to piece together because of its several unique features. 
“It was like, ‘How do we create this masterpiece that is not all over the place but takes you on a journey?’ And that’s why I love that song,” Shane said. “It starts so simple and then it ends huge, which [performing] live is gonna be insane.” 
For Shane, “Tripwire’’ is a monumental project resulting from her newfound partnership with Baer and the community of like-minded creative students she found at USC. As opposed to previously working alone and following instructions from older-aged producers in her hometown of Denver, Colorado, the students Shane has met since moving to Los Angeles transformed her perceptions of music and expression, learning that “spontaneity and creativity together is just magical.” 
“Coming to L.A., I was able to bring all of my issues, struggles, feelings and challenges in mental health and trauma and trust issues and things that are universal and finally connect that with a bigger community of artists,” Shane said. “I [found] a lot of similarities with myself and other people through music.” 
As a result of such connections, Shane’s mother, Amy, believes that her daughter’s music positively reflects her maturing perceptions, from balancing her passion to fostering supportive friendships and creative relationships. 
“I think, actually, her music is even better because of that — because she’s living her life,” Amy said. “Music is a part of her life now — still [a] very significant part — but she, by living life, she has something to write about, she has something to sing about [and] to sing for. It gives her a much broader depth.” 
Baer expressed similar thoughts on the effectiveness of a supportive environment, relating that “Tripwire” is an example of how Elly, himself and their friends helped push each other to improve artistically. 
“The most important thing creatively for someone to feel is like they’re in an environment where they’re being supported and being pushed, and I hope that people will see this project as this USC-bred environment where everyone came together and worked,” Baer said. “An environment where everyone learned and got better.”
Elly says she will follow honesty and creativity wherever it leads her, taking her past experiences as lessons to further hone her craft and expressions as a person and artist.
“I think the best songs on the EP were the ones that were the most honest,” Elly said. “And, it’s a learning process to learn how to write honestly and not filter yourself to what you think people wanna hear, [and] to think about how you want people to view you because, sometimes when you’re honest, the world may hate you for what you say, but it’s still really important to say it.”
“Tripwire” will be available on all streaming platforms on April 22, and Elly will perform the EP live at Tirebiter Brewery May 4.

Wow, we’ve made it to the finale. It feels like just yesterday I was previewing the United States Men’s National Team’s chances of winning its first match in World Cup Qualifying. Now, I write this knowing for certain that the U.S. is back in the biggest sporting competition on planet Earth. Feels good, doesn’t it? 
If you’ve read this column in any capacity, you would know that my passion for our nation’s soccer team burns brighter than the SoCal summer sun. That being said, I sometimes forget that not everyone cares as much as I do. 
I’m not completely delusional (Hard to believe, right?). I know there are plenty of people out there who, for reasons which I will never understand, don’t find soccer entertaining enough to tune in. This is personally unacceptable — I want everyone on board for this World Cup. I want everyone to be able to experience the boundless joy that this sport and this team can provide. 
So, whether you care already or not (I know most of you don’t, it’s okay), listen up. For the grand send-off of this column, I’m going to do my best Marshall student impression and try to sell you something. By the end of this piece, you will hopefully be circling the dates the U.S. plays next on your calendars. Here’s three reasons why you need to watch the United States Men’s National Team play soccer, in the upcoming World Cup and beyond. 
This group of players represents us better than ever 
Soccer in the U.S. has long been justly criticized for its classist barriers and a lack of diversity. To play at the highest level, families are often dishing out significant amounts of money for their children to play in developmental academies across the country; the average family will pay $1,472 for their child to play one year of club soccer. 
I’m going to keep it real: There’s still much work to be done in increasing diversity. Nonetheless, the push to make soccer inclusive for all in this country is slowly but surely working, and there’s no better support for that statement than this current USMNT team’s roster. 
Today’s teams are far more diverse than the rosters of past decades. Of the 38 players that were selected to the U.S. roster during this World Cup Qualifying cycle, over half were people of color. 
There’s something so special about the fact that, for more and more Americans, they can look to at least one player on this roster and say, “Hey, this guy looks like me.” It makes it easy to root for them. This team truly represents a key factor in what makes the U.S. so great — its diversity. 
The on-field product is getting better and more dramatic
I know, it’s a bold statement to make, especially with all of the shit-talking I’ve done on the squad throughout the qualifying cycle. 
But I really do mean it. The individual and group quality of this side, on its day, is as high as it has ever been. More and more players are choosing to play their club soccer in European leagues with higher levels of competition. The ceiling for this team is higher than cannabis enthusiasts were yesterday, and the U.S. has a chance to be giant-slayers at the World Cup.
The problem arises when you talk about the team’s floor. It’s uncomfortably low, as the U.S. has a tendency to play down to the level of inferior competition. 
But, let me spin this negative take in a way you may not expect: You’re going to love the drama. And when I say drama, I mean “The Bachelor/Bachelorette” level drama. The frantic and unpredictable nature of this squad makes it a prime source of entertainment. You’ll fall in love with some players and learn to hate some others, like we all do with reality TV stars. 
For all the predictions that experts are making, no one really knows how the team will look come November. The USMNT is a rollercoaster of highs and lows, and we all love theme parks, don’t we?
The situation could not be more perfect 
The U.S. faces England in the World Cup Nov. 25 — the day after Thanksgiving. The motherland versus the revolutionaries. If that doesn’t get you hyped up, what will? 
It’s not a hard sell. Rivals since 1776, the U.S. and England will meet each other in the group stage of the World Cup. This will be the most watched soccer match in the history of American viewership, mark my words. 
The match will be an absolute peak moment of sports shenanigans and nationalistic rivalry. Who doesn’t want to beat the Brits for all of that “taxation without representation” that went down? It’s rare that we get the opportunity to witness a highly consequential matchup with this much historical and global importance. It’s “football” versus “soccer” for all the marbles. You can’t miss it.  
That’ll do it for “Soccer in the States” this school year. This column has been a therapeutic experience for me — consolidating my many feelings, always erratic and fiery, into writing is incredibly rewarding. Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I’ll see you in Qatar.

Last semester, I approached my CORE 111 writing seminar class with apprehension. I had always heard how ruthless college writing courses could be. I expected unachievable grading standards, especially since I was in the Thematic Option program, which emphasizes scholarly writing.
However, my anxiety-fueled presuppositions were quickly subverted. My professor introduced her course and her grading style with something I had never seen before — a grading contract. My subsequent experiences with contract grading have inspired me to argue for this alternative grading style to become the norm in college writing courses.
What these grading contracts entail is rather simple: a list of requirements, agreed upon by both the professor and the student, that the latter must fulfill in order to earn an A in the course. These requirements may pertain to class etiquette, tardiness and attendance, participation, quality of writing, demonstrated improvement and a variety of other performance factors. California State University, Sacramento professor Lynda S. Radican credits grading contracts as being able to “essentially transform the grading process from teacher-developed criteria into an agreement between teacher and student, with considerable freedom for students to propose and assess work on their own initiative.” 
My CORE 112 professor this semester also uses a grading contract rather than traditional letter grades. The contract, which I agreed to at the start of the semester, promises students an A in the class if we: “turn up prepared;” “engage in class discussions;” “do the written work;” “cultivate a risk-taking sensibility;” “embrace failure;” “show care for [our] reader;” “give [ourselves] time to improve” and “are nice.”
This means that none of the papers, projects or assignments submitted by students earn letter grades. Rather, students solely receive constructive feedback on their work, cultivating a lower-stakes environment where taking risks is encouraged. Grading contracts alleviate stress in the classroom — rather than catering my submissions to what I think my professor wants to see, I am able to prioritize my own individual style and growth.
Contributors Dan Melzer, D.J. Quinn, Lisa Sperber and Sarah Faye of Writing Commons, a peer-reviewed collegiate education resource, explain that “students are often more concerned with how to get an ‘A’ than how to write effectively for different audiences, purposes, and genres,” continuing that “focusing on grades is not only less satisfying than focusing on learning, it’s also very stressful and can put students and teachers into an adversarial relationship rather than a learning partnership.” 
This is precisely why grading contracts should become the norm in writing courses. Especially with the egregious cost of attendance many USC students face, higher learning should be a rewarding, partnership-based process, not a patronizing system dependent on letter grades. Plus, nobody should be reduced to a letter on a scale — it’s dehumanizing. 
Old Dominion University professor Annette Finley-Croswhite wrote in a 2021 article for the school’s Center for Faculty Development News that “many faculty and students observe that efforts to improve writing via contract grading are increased because students must respond to instructor feedback to complete assignments, and they have more room to experiment without fear of a ‘bad grade.’”
I’ve certainly experienced this phenomenon myself, as I have noticed I am more receptive to feedback and less defensive to criticism of my work in classes that use grading contracts. I genuinely want to improve my writing in these courses, and my main goal is not to earn a certain grade.
I urge writing professors to consider switching their grading systems to contract grading for the benefit of their students, who may both perform better and experience less academic stress as a result. USC is an innovative institution that has changed greatly over time, and it’s time for the grading status quo to evolve with the University.

I wouldn’t be alone in confessing that I rely on Twitter, in part, to keep me current on pop culture and the latest news. In prefinals times such as these when I only leave my apartment to make necessary trips to Dulce and back, Twitter props up the rock I would otherwise live under. However, despite my well-intended conviction that humans are righteous, truth-seeking creatures capable of differentiating truth and misinformation, I know all too well that we’re simply not wired that way.
Combating misinformation is a crucial step in preserving the integrity of our media, but we must do so with an understanding of how it occurs and compassion for those who disseminate it.
Misinformation as old as human communication itself, dates back to two kajillion years ago when Cronk deceptively told Torg there was a lion by the stream and Torg told, well, everyone. In more recent times, misinformation has accrued the power to sway political processes and cause serious harm. You may recall 2016’s Pizzagate, a false conspiracy theory that led to a shooting at a D.C. pizzeria. More recently, misinformation surrounding coronavirus included the mischaracterization of its severity, promotion of false treatment measures and undue blame for its spread on members of the AAPI community who faced an increase in racialized violence in 2020. 
The everything, all-the-time, all-at-once-nature of social media acts as a Petri dish for propagating a culture of widespread misinformation, so news spreads quicker than ever regardless of whether it’s true. In fact, an MIT study found that on Twitter false news stories are 70% more likely to be retweeted than true stories.
For the record, there’s an important distinction between misinformation and disinformation. Misinformation is falsehood spread unintentionally, retweeting something under the assumption that it’s true when it isn’t. Disinformation is the deliberate, malicious production and dissemination of false information for the purposes of fulfilling a personal or political agenda. 
I have no empathy for disinformation spreaders. Disguising false news as truth and real news as fake compromises our democratic institutions and stifles a free press. 
There are two main reasons why misinformation spreads more rapidly than truth. 
First, people love new things. We love the novelty of a juicy new fact that no one has seen before. As such, news publications jump to be the first to report on fresh stories. The pressure to publish something original and attention-grabbing pushes many publications — and even more Twitter accounts — to publish news without ensuring their legitimacy. 
Second, pissing people off is a good way to go viral. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that “anger is a high-arousal emotion, which drives people to take action.” When people are fired up, they are more likely to repost, retweet or regurgitate. Anger as a motivator could explain how movements like #StopTheSteal gained traction as hundreds of thousands of angry voters tried to reverse an election their news sources told them had been rigged.
While we can be quick to point fingers at who is most responsible for spreading misinformation, consider the already prevalent issue of political tribalism. The crusade against misinformation has made a bad situation worse by deepening the political divide and breeding hostility across ideological lines. It’s easier to admit someone else, “the enemy,” is responsible for disseminating misinformation, but the truth is that all of us are complicit in sustaining the chokehold misinformation has on our political and social processes.
At the root of our culpability for spreading misinformation lies the desire for group identity. People just want to belong — it’s what social scientists call “in-grouping,” the idea that group identity creates a sense of belonging and superiority. While in-grouping doesn’t account for all misinformation, our tendency to view the world from an “us” versus “them” perspective causes us to view information as either affirming or challenging our existing beliefs. We’re drawn to information that brings us comfort, and we resist information that enrages us, but comforting information isn’t necessarily truthful information.
We don’t necessarily want facts, but we definitely want to belong. For every well-informed media consumer who’s savvy to the influences of commercialism and the nuances of sensationalism, there’s another person falling down one of many dark rabbit holes. In those cases, condescension won’t help and neither will another online screaming match. The vast majority of our friends, relatives, and fellow internet neighbors aren’t experts in sussing out deceptive data or discerning the quiet power of the algorithm. Approaching misinformation with as much compassion and humanity as possible might be what prevents its most violent and tragic consequences.
Only once more people realize the motivations behind spreading misinformation are quite relatable will we be in the right collective mindset to combat it effectively. After all, who doesn’t want to belong?

USC lacrosse is preparing to play in its final regular season Pac-12 match Friday against Arizona State in Tempe, Ariz. The Trojans held steady at No. 17 in this week’s IWLCA poll after two conference victories over the weekend. 
USC defeated Colorado 15-8 last Friday afternoon. The Trojans outshot Colorado 36-26 and also won the center circle, picking up 16 draw controls to the Buffaloes’ 11. USC never trailed and held a lead as large as 8 goals at one point in the fourth quarter.
Junior attacker Ella Heany led the team in points and matched her career-high with 7 points — 4 goals and 3 assists. Redshirt freshman attacker Isabelle Vitale recorded 5 points on 3 goals and 2 assists. In goal, junior goalie Kait Devir had 8 saves. 
Devir, a transfer from Boston College in her first season with the Trojans, credits much of her smooth transition to the relationships she has formed with her teammates. 
“Coming in every single day and working through practice, training and lifts, we really make those strong relationships,” Devir said. “Our team culture is really big on not just connecting on the field but off the field, and we do a really good job of that.”
USC also took care of business in Eugene, Ore. Sunday against Oregon, winning 16-9. The Trojans were able to get many different players scoring chances, with 10 different players registering goals. USC outshot the Ducks 28-21, won the center circle 16-11 and recorded a season-high 28 ground balls. This victory moved the Trojans to 7-2 in Pac-12 play. 
The Trojans have two more games in their regular season, only one of which is against a conference opponent in Arizona State. The Sun Devils are also 7-2 in the Pac-12, tied with USC for first place in the conference. 
In their first matchup of the season, USC defeated ASU 17-10. Since that game, ASU has put up several notable wins, including victories over No. 14 Rutgers and No. 22 Stanford. 
Head Coach Lindsey Munday said she has emphasized playing with energy from the jump to her team.
“I think, just like we have all season, [we need to] play together and have a full 60 minutes,” Munday said. “Against a team like Arizona State, we can’t have a down quarter or a down half or a slow start.”
With a win against Arizona State, USC would secure the first seed heading into the Pac-12 Tournament. The Trojans have already secured their place in the top four teams, meaning they won’t have to play in the quarterfinal round.
“Having a bye in the first round is really important,” Munday said. “It’s helpful to be able to go in fresh instead of having those back-to-back games.” 
However, Munday doesn’t want seeding to be the Trojans’ focus going into Friday’s matchup. 
We don’t want to be thinking about that,” she said. “We want to be thinking about our game and our execution.”
The Trojans will take on Arizona State Friday at 2 p.m. at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe.
