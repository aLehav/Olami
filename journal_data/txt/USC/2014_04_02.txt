USC senior Omeed Anvar and 2013 alumnus Simon Huang are part of a select group of approximately 140 students from across the country who are participating in the spring 2014 White House Internship Program, which began in January and is ending this May.
Anvar, a business administration and political science major who has worked on political campaigns for Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and President Barack Obama, is working within the White House Office of Communications. Huang, a May 2013 graduate who majored in international relations, works for the Domestic Policy Council. The Daily Trojan interviewed the two interns about their time in the nation’s capitol and what the future holds.
DT: How did you first learn of the White House Internship Program?
Anvar: It’s hard to pinpoint how exactly I learned about the White House Internship Program because interns are so ubiquitous in politics that I always assumed there was a White House Internship Program. This has been a goal of mine since I first started volunteering for the president’s campaign in late 2007.
Huang: I don’t know if there was a time when I wasn’t at least aware of the White House Internship Program as an opportunity. I think that many, if not most, students interested in public service or politics have at least heard of the internship as a once-in-a-lifetime learning experience.
DT: What duties do you typically perform?
Anvar: I work in the research division of the communications department, where I assist in conducting research and                           fact-checking. I also work on other press office projects.
Huang: I have a variety of responsibilities, many of which tend to appear unexpectedly. There isn’t really an “average” day in the Domestic Policy Council, and my schedule is contingent on the schedules of my supervisors, which are always in flux. On average, my work consists of a balance of research, event management, scheduling and writing.
DT: As an intern for the Office of Communications, what specific projects or initiatives have you worked on?
Anvar: The great thing about working in the Office of Communications is that it has allowed me to be involved in some way in all of the major initiatives that have been going on during my time here. The president has been very active since the State of the Union address, which has made my time here even more enjoyable.
DT: As an intern for the Domestic Policy Council, what policies have you worked on?
Huang: I work in a subsection of the DPC called the Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation. Our office advances government policies centered around expanding national service and supporting social sector organizations such as nonprofits, foundations and social enterprises. We work with organizations from across sectors to support a diverse group of projects — from reducing prison recidivism to encouraging volunteerism.
DT: What is your most memorable experience as a White House intern thus far?
Anvar: The most memorable experience is the first time the President delivered remarks that I helped fact-check. Seeing this entire process come together was an experience I will never forget.
Huang: Although an intern gets to witness a lot of unique events at the White House — we have an excellent speaker series, for example — I think the things I remember the most will be all the errors I’ve made so far while working here. I’ve done quite a few internships, but my mistakes have never felt quite so consequential. I feel that every time I’m corrected, I get slightly more competent. It certainly helps that my supervisors are an insanely talented bunch — and incredibly patient, I might add.
DT: Was there a specific class or professor at USC that motivated you to get involved in the political field?
Anvar: Definitely! First of all, there is no way I would be here today without Dan Schnur, who teaches POSC 439 [Critical Issues in Politics]. Getting involved in politics can be intimidating since a lot opportunities depend on networking and being at the right place at the right time. Knowing that Dan believed in me and that I always had his support gave me the confidence to pursue a lot of the opportunities that led me to where I am today.
Huang: Professor Lamy’s case study course was probably the most influential in driving [me] toward public service. I’ve always been interested in policy issues rather than the politics behind them, but Lamy’s course instructed me in the hands-on process of dissolving complicated policy and the positive impact that an individual can have if they develop that skill properly.
DT: How did your USC experience prepare you for the internship?
Anvar: My USC experience was filled with a variety of different experiences which helped me develop a wide set of professional and personal skills that have been very useful during this internship. The combination of academic and leadership experiences I had definitely helped me prepare for a fast-paced work environment.
Huang: USC gave me several opportunities to pursue policy-related coursework and internships, both abroad and in Los Angeles, which helped develop a skill set suited for this highly challenging internship. The Thematic Option program, in particular, was extremely helpful in sharpening my writing skills, which have proven to be indispensable in the policy world.
DT: What is your biggest takeaway from the experience?
Anvar: This internship has definitely reinforced my commitment to public service in both my professional and private life. It has also given me great insight into and appreciation for all the amazing work that is done by the hardworking staff here at the White House. At the end of the day I cannot believe how much work has been done, yet how much is left to do.
Huang: Humility. I am profoundly fortunate to be here and I know that there are thousands who are just as, if not more, qualified than I am. I’ve learned that public service is about using the opportunities available to do something positive for your community or country. It is extremely humbling to work in such a challenging environment and to see the yawning gap in experience and talent between you and many of the people you work with.
DT: What’s next for you?
Anvar: Right now I am just focused on making the most of this incredible experience and have not spent much time thinking about the future. I am graduating in May, so I plan on returning to Los Angeles for at least a short time after my internship ends. At that point, I will probably talk to some of my mentors and my family and come to a decision about what is next for me.
Huang: I’d like to continue working in public service, preferably abroad in the field of foreign relations. I do enjoy living in Washington, and there are few better places for someone interested in policy.

The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, Political Student Assembly, Environmental Student Assembly and Political Science Undergraduate Association hosted “California Politics Roundtable Discussion” Wednesday night. The theme of this discussion  was “California’s Environmental Challenges and Opportunities,” to coincide with Earth Month, which occurs every April.
Green talks · Former state Assemblyman Anthony Portantino (left) and former state Senator Tony Strickland (right) spoke on environmental issues. – Jessica Zhao | Daily Trojan
 
At the head of the table were USC’s two legislators in residence: former State Senator Tony Strickland and former Assemblyman Anthony Portantino. Portantino, who also teaches a class at USC, has been interacting with and mentoring students since he and Strickland began the program last year.
The conversation was moderated by Justin Bogda, director of the Political Student Assembly .
“We’re in a gridlock of party politics about whether or not climate change exists,” he said. “It’s very important for students to get involved and to be informed so that we can create a new generation of people that isn’t arguing about the existence of these problems, and instead debating how we are going to remove our consumption of finite resources that we don’t have forever.”
The conversation began with direct questions to Portantino and Strickland, the first of which concerned the science behind climate change. Portantino, who is hoping to teach a class at USC in the fall, said science is conclusive about the existence of warming.
“It is hotter in places where it used to be cooler and is it cooler in places where it used to be hotter,” he said.
Strickland, who is running for Congress, disputed the absolute nature of the science cited by climate activists, and countered Portantino’s humor with some of his own.
“When I was a kid it was global cooling — I got a little older and it’s called global warming, and now it’s called climate change,” he said. “The problem with that is scientists will be on both sides. There are a lot of scientists that say it’s a hoax.”
Though Portantino disagreed with Strickland, he was able to find common ground with Strickland on the need to carefully craft environmental regulations to avoid unnecessary damage to the economy.
“Tony brings up a very good point,” he said. “In order to have a traditional economy that has jobs, you have to make things and you have to build things. When you make things and when you build things, there is generally an environmental consequence. The harder you make it to build things, the less jobs you are going to have.”
Bogda then opened the conversation to questions from the students, who weren’t afraid to disagree with Strickland and Portantino about where the priorities should lie.
Tara Campbell, a junior majoring in political science and broadcast and digital journalism, agreed with Strickland on the focus of energy independence as opposed to strictly environmental regulation.
“The United States has the ability to become energy independent,” she said. “Environmental policy is low on the priority list when we have the ability to increase economic growth and reduce dependency on foreign powers.”

With the rise of electronic dance music, the national College Battle of the Bands tour has evolved to add a new competition called Campus DJ. Starting last year as a way to provide a more appropriate outlet for the high number of DJ submissions in the classic college music competition, Campus DJ is now in its second season and is eager to find the next big college artist. The competition runs nationwide throughout the next few months, with the national finale on June 18.
The way the contest works is that it tours around the country, hitting various universities along the way. The tour includes Cal State Long Beach, Colgate, ASU, Emory, UNC Chapel Hill, San Francisco State, Michigan State, University of Oregon, Chicago Citywide, New York Citywide and UT Austin.
College DJs sign up on the Campus DJ website, providing info, music samples and social media links on their profiles, and from there voters choose their favorites. The DJ who gets the most votes in each region gets an automatic entry, and three or four additional DJs selected by the judges based on strength of submission and fan voting get to compete live in their regional competition. Winners of the regional competitions then advance to the national finale at Avalon Hollywood in June.
Francisco Gomez-Palacio, a sophomore at USC who currently works as an A&R assistant for Campus DJ, works toward finding this talent.
“My job is to seek out and find these talented artists, listen to their music and help make decisions, along with industry leaders, about who to select to perform at these regional competitions,” he said.
In addition to scouting out the best up-and-comers in EDM, Gomez-Palacio communicates with the DJs participating in the competition. This sometimes, proves difficult, however, with the amount of distance between some of the contestants. He is currently trying to solve this problem by working with the Campus DJ team to create an A&R scout program for Campus DJ. This would scatter scouts at colleges throughout the country to “have a more direct and effective interaction with DJs” and further improve the scouting and selection process.
Gomez-Palacio reports to Nate Howard, a 2013 graduate of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, who is now a full-time member of the Campus DJ team, and coordinates all the events and serves as a host at the actual competition.
“I travel all around the country with our team to the various regional events to organize and eventually host them,” Howard said. “I also help answer any questions the competing DJs have, I help them prep for the competition when they arrive, I introduce them to the audiences and I interview them during the event.”
At each event, the judging panel typically consists of two experienced music industry judges, a Campus DJ representative and a representative from the hosting college. Past judges have included DJ Reid Speed, Ken Jordan of the Crystal Method and Academy Award Winning Songwriter Damon Ranger. DJs’ performances are judged based on originality, energy, presence and artist potential. Each regional winner then gets to open for a headliner later in the night and continues on to the national finale. Once all the finalists are chosen, two wild card finalists — one chosen by the fans, and one by the A&R committee — are added to the mix to compete as well.
Campus DJ’s National Finale on June 18 will bring all the finalists to Avalon Hollywood to crown the next promising new act in EDM. The grand prize includes a $10,000 cash prize from Monster Energy and Campus DJ and a free year of burritos from Chipotle. Even better, the finalists will be “spinning for a cause” and spin on behalf of a charity of their choice. Presented by Chegg, this bit of the winnings gives a cash grant to the winner’s chosen cause. Last year, grand prize winner DJ Flaxo donated his cash grant to 826 National, a free after-school tutoring program that helps students with their writing skills.
In addition, each competition features popular DJs to headline the whole event to draw students at the universities to come check out the contestants. In the past, the competitions have hosted DJ 3LAU, Carnage and The Cataracs, to name a few. This year, some of the guest headlining artists include Cash Cash, known for the hit “Take Me Home,” and the Chainsmokers, who performed at USC Phi Sigma Kappa MasqueRave last semester and recently came out with the viral track “#SELFIE.”
DJ Flaxo of Columbia University has received a lot of attention since his win from last season. Recently, DJ Flaxo was featured on BBC Radio and Vibe, and big time artists like Showtek, Baauer, Flosstradamus, RL Grime and Krewella have used his tracks for their radio programs and live mixes. With this kind of widespread exposure, his following has skyrocketed.
Gomez-Palacio is excited about DJ Flaxo’s expanding popularity, as that is the whole purpose of Campus DJ, and hopes that this year’s winner will reach the same success.
“We strive to find the next big thing and propel talented DJs as much as we can,” Gomez-Palacio said. “I’m excited to see who takes home the crown this year.”

Clothes strewn on the floor. Dimmed lights. A couple intertwined on a couch. Whispered words. Passionate kisses.
An upstairs room at a USC frat house? One might guess. But no, it is La Ronde, the scandalous, thought-provoking play opening this Thursday at USC. The play explores various relationships between men and women, including husband and wife, man and mistress, master of the house and parlor maid and soldier and prostitute. The small vignettes, or “dialogues,” as noted by playwright Arthur Schnitzler, show the various couples before and after their sexual encounters. The show is a School of Dramatic Arts production and is directed by faculty member and Artistic Director Jack Rowe.
When the show was first publicly performed in 1920, it elicited extreme reactions from both critics and the public. Though many members of high society had accepted that these affairs frequently happened, they were not prepared to be exposed to them on stage. Schnitzler was seen to be inappropriately shattering taboos in his urgent social commentary, and the play was banned from performance in Germany for many years.
From first glance, this might be seen as “the sex show;” even the actors admit that is how they thought of it after first reading. And truly, the basic plot of the show revolves around sex. But after looking closer, one can see it is about much more than that.
“You come for the sex, but you stay for the conversation. It’s not just the sex that’s provocative,” said Kaitlin Kelly, who plays a character simply called “The Whore.”
Though the play was written and takes place in the late 1890s, the themes addressed by the playwright are incredibly accessible. Schnitzler’s discussion of class, gender, relationships, age, infidelity and happiness are as relevant today as they were during its first production.
La Ronde, meaning, “the round,” was originally titled “Der Reigen,” which means “a round dance.” This circular concept is an excellent description of the play’s structure, both throughout the entire work and within each scene. Through each scene, we see couples come together, then move apart, a seamless transition from one lover to the next —  sort of “what goes around, comes around” mentality in a world where hypocrisy and secrecy rule.
The actors particularly found parallels between the show and life at USC.
“The play is about looking beyond just that one moment of pleasure and trying to make a real connection with someone. That connection is very easily lost right now, especially with USC’s hook-up culture,” said Maddie Gill, who plays “The Actress.” “That’s one of the reasons I was drawn to this play, because I think it’s a story that needs to be told.”
Though one might think performing such a sexual show would be the biggest challenge for the actors, many cast members admit the format of the show is one of the biggest difficulties.
“We have to keep the ensemble together. Having a cast when most of you never interact on stage is a challeng; we have to make sure we all tell the same story,” Kelly said.
To Gill, “La Ronde” means “it’s all connected, and you have to find the connections.” Finding these connections is not easily done.
“You’re only in two scenes, so there must be some sort of change in your character between the two scenes,” Gill said.
Though difficult, Joanna Brodecki “The Parlor Maid” gushed “when something works, it’s the best feeling. It’s the most beautiful thing. Every challenge has been so fun.”
The writing and language itself has been an additional challenge for the performers, and not just because the play is 100 years old.
“It’s all subtext,” Gill said. “There’s no real action in the play, not a plot like ‘Hamlet’s dad is dead’ sort of thing. It’s all focused on words, and it is easy to get lost if you don’t know what you’re talking about. You have to find the specificity in everything.”
Kelly said that the dialogue gives actors a great challenge.
“His writing is very open-ended, and it’s a great challenge for an actor to have to make lots of active decisions on your own,” Kelly said. “It’s definitely daunting when you have a million ellipses and each one is a different specific choice that is completely open to your interpretation.”
The actors feel there are many themes that audiences today, especially students, will relate to. Much of the play revolves around the idea of happiness — is happiness attainable? If so, how?
“Is it through love? Is it through sex? Is it through money? Is it through food? Spoiler alert: It’s not,” Kelly said.
In today’s digital world, where things are constantly changing and we are constantly being fed information, La Ronde is about being “in the moment, versus maintaining something in the future or looking in the past,” Brodecki said.
The cast was particularly passionate as discussing the impact and importance of the show:
“It’s looking at relationships in general and appreciating everyone you interact with,” Brodecki said.
Kelly agreed, “It’s gaining some perspective on the importance every moment can have.
“It’s about realizing everyone’s a person and Facebook isn’t a person,” Gill added.
Perhaps Schnitzel is able to say it best, as he writes in one of the final scenes of the play,  “Happiness? Happiness doesn’t exist. None of the things people chatter about really exist … Love, for instance. It’s the same with love. Enjoyment … intoxication … there’s nothing wrong with them, they’re real. I enjoy something, all right, and I know I enjoy it. Or I’m intoxicated, all right. That’s real too. And when it’s over, it’s over, that’s all.”
 
La Ronde runs Thursday, April 3, through Sunday, April 6 at the Scene Dock Theater. Tickets are available at the door or through the Ticket Office.

Captain America is unique among superheroes in that he’s a square with sharp edges, an overgrown Boy Scout whose unflappable sense of right and wrong allows him to reject mindless jingoism in favor of higher virtues: bravery, compassion and a fierce sense of moral accountability. Co-created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, the character looks like a walking, talking recruitment poster — but on the inside he’s still scrawny little Steve Rogers, sworn to be helpful because he remembers what it’s like to be helpless. From cold-cocking Adolf Hitler on the cover of his first edition in 1941 to leading the Avengers in 2012, Cap has always been one of comics’ most fascinating contradictions: a political idealist disguised as a star-spangled propaganda tool.
Oh captain! My captain! · Captain America (Chris Evans) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) find themselves disillusioned with S.H.I.E.L.D. after the appearance of a mysterious new enemy in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, set to release April 4.– Photo courtesy of Marvel Studios
Joe Johnston’s 2011 film Captain America: The First Avenger understood this. The movie was a rousing, unabashedly goofy tribute to World War II adventure serials that worked mainly due to the strength of its supporting cast — especially Hugo Weaving as the dastardly Red Skull — and the whiz-bang charm of its period setting. It found our hero, played with true-blue earnestness by Chris Evans, securely in his element: battling clearly defined bad guys such as the Nazi-sponsored terrorist ring HYDRA with his unit of Howling Commandos and making whoopee with the flirty but capable Agent Peggy Carter, played by Hayley Atwell.
The film’s box office haul — $176 million on a budget of roughly $140 million — was relatively modest by superhero standards, but it succeeded in incorporating Cap into Marvel’s cinematic universe, adding a much-needed sense of history and old school heroism to the stories that followed.
Then came Joss Whedon’s crossover opus The Avengers, which flung the gallant super-soldier into the modern world and tasked him with uniting a team of squabbling super-frenemies in time to save New York City from an alien armada led by the power-mad Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston. Some of the film’s early scenes — think of all those broken punching bags — hint at Cap’s struggle to adapt to a time period where most of his loved ones are either dead or languishing in retirement homes, but that existential angst seems to lift the moment he finds another foe to hurl his vibranium shield toward.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier, the newest and most politically conscious Marvel offering to date, refuses to grant our hero the luxury of knowing his enemy, a development that reflects the ambiguity of our own geopolitical reality. With the Battle of New York won and the Avengers effectively on hiatus since the Great Shawarma Summit, Cap has thrown himself into his fieldwork with S.H.I.E.L.D., signing on for increasingly perilous missions that allow for plenty of bonding time with the lithe, lethal Black Widow, played by Scarlett Johansson. When these operations begin calling for pre-emptive drone strikes, illegal surveillance techniques and other ethically dubious measures, an unnerved Cap voices his concerns to Nick Fury, portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson, who fires back with this cryptic response: “S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as it is, not as we’d like it to be.”
Many reviews have compared The Winter Soldier to paranoia thrillers from the ’70s such as The Conversation and The Parallax View, both compelling but deeply cynical films that spoke to the American people’s suspicions about the government and other major institutions in the noxious wake of Watergate. These similarities are only reinforced by the presence of Robert Redford, the star of Three Days of the Condor and All the President’s Men, who appears in The Winter Soldier as Alexander Pierce, a Washington, D.C. wheeler-dealer and S.H.I.E.L.D. bigwig whose easy smile hides the banked fires of a zealot. There’s also the eponymous Winter Soldier himself, a brainwashed assassin with an artificial arm and spoiler-heavy ties to Cap’s past. Judging by the trailer, he also wears more mascara than all the members of Green Day combined.
Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have all cited Ed Brubaker’s acclaimed run on the comics as a primary influence on The Winter Soldier. Brubaker, a veteran of both Marvel and DC Comics, actually created the character back in 2005 as part of an effort to reinvigorate the series.
This grounded, more character-driven approach might also explain why Feige hired Joe and Anthony Russo — known collectively as the Russo Brothers — to direct the picture. The Russos, whose previous IMDB credits include the forgettable Owen Wilson comedy You, Me and Dupree and TV shows such as Arrested Development and Community, appear to have earned their blockbuster bonafides while filming The Winter Soldier, especially since Marvel has already asked them to helm the newly announced Captain America 3, which is currently aiming for a 2016 release date.
The more things around him change, the more Captain America needs to stay the same. Unlike Batman and Superman, who can support multiple impressions and interpretations, there’s really only one way to present Cap: steadfast yet gentle, hopeful yet honest. He’s not the United States’ mascot, nor was he ever meant to be. He’s the larger-than-life ideal we should all be striving for, regardless of where we come from, free from all labels and the terrors of misunderstanding. As the big man himself once said, by way of writer Frank Miller: “I’m loyal to nothing… except the Dream.”

Best known for its beach, pier and shopping, downtown Santa Monica has become an iconic Southern California destination that fuses upscale stores with a casual outdoor setting, which makes finding parking or an open table at restaurants close to impossible during lunch and dinner hours. But just three blocks down from the always-bustling Third Street Promenade, a new deli is delivering delicious snacks for a modest price, a rare combination in Santa Monica. Founded by the team behind the Piccolo restaurant in Venice, Calif., Ciboteca opened its doors on March 28 as an upscale Italian cafe just a few minutes’ walk from the L.A. hotspot.
Ciboteca is hidden in a residential environment, tucked away on a corner of Broadway and 6th Street. Its location explains the type of customers it has already attracted, residents looking to grab a quick bite to go before work and businessmen and women during lunch breaks. The interior design of the deli also speaks to the nature of its targeted audience. It’s a spacious cafe with modern furniture and two long counters of pastries on display. Not only do the counters of food make ordering quicker and easier for busy Angelenos, but it also allows customers to feel more connected with their food; the restaurant is an upscale Subway, in other words, where customers are able to see their paninis, as well as the ingredients that make up their meal, prepared right before their eyes. A high table, big enough for a crowd of six, stands in the middle of the cafe surrounded by a few more tables. The minimal seating arrangements, again, emphasize the fact that Ciboteca customers are not looking to stay.
The food at the Italian deli is not as varied as the menus of its competitors. Ciboteca offers paninis, salad, three breakfast selections, soup and, for the hungrier customers, gastronomia. The number of sandwich options might leave people torn, especially when so many items on the menu sound very similar, for instance, the prosciutto panini (San Daniele prosciutto, montasio cheese) and the breakfast croissant (croissant sandwich, prosciutto, gruyere) are nearly identical. Because of this, the amiable waiters become even more helpful when it comes time to order. They will go to great lengths — including asking the chef himself — to help customers make a decision. The breakfast prosciutto croissant is served on a cute antique-looking plate; the sandwich is toasted to perfection, crusty enough that the texture is crisp but soft so that it melts in the mouth with a lingering aftertaste of butter. The prosciutto is salty, the cheese adds a pinch of bitterness and the croissant has just the right amount of fluff. It really does make a great all-day breakfast option. The only problem is the small size of the croissant, which can be easily finished in seven bites. This is especially disappointing considering how scrumptious it is.
Though the combination of Italian ham, brie and marinated artichokes in the cotto panini is exciting too, it does not live up to the prosciutto breakfast. The panini bread is harder, it lacks the flavor of the butter croissant sandwich and the ham is a bit bland. It’s still a great panini, but after tasting the prosciutto croissant, there simply is no going back. Other items on the menu that have already been deemed favorites by many customers include the lasagna, the pollo panini (rotisserie chicken, pancetta, tomato, rosemary mayonnaise) and the pastries on display at the counter (fruit tarts, coffee cake, opera and more).
Even though everything about Ciboteca speaks to the busy schedule of its customers, there is still something about the Italian deli that makes it the ideal getaway for people looking to sit down. Perhaps it is the fact that its location allows it to be close enough to the shops and beach but simultaneously distant enough to mute out the chaos of Third Street Promenade. The truth is there is nothing about Ciboteca that makes its customers want to get up and leave. The service is amazing, with friendly waiters frequently checking in to make sure customers’ expectations are met, and the food ranges from good to mouth-wateringly delicious. In addition, the quiet nature of 6th Street’s neighborhood makes 3rd Street seem like a post-apocalyptic scene, making leaving the cafe a scary thought. Ciboteca is perfect for everyone, whether it’s busy people running errands or exhausted shoppers looking for food and peace.
 
Ciboteca is located at 606 Broadway, and is open from 8 a.m. – 8  p.m. daily.

The top-ranked USC women’s golf team will attempt to win its third straight tournament this weekend at the annual Liz Murphy Collegiate Invitational, which runs Friday through Sunday, at the UGA Golf Course in Athens, Ga.

The defending national champions have won seven wins out of their past eight tournaments; if they are going to win this weekend’s tournament, however, they will need to do it without their best individual player, sophomore Annie Park. Park, the No. 3-ranked collegiate golfer and the No. 2-ranked amateur player, will instead head to the LPGA’s Kraft Nabisco Championship today through Sunday, at Mission Hills C.C. in Rancho Mirage, Calif.
Another challenge for the Women of Troy will be the alternative format at the Liz Murphy Invitational. The tournament will not follow normal tournament rules;  instead, it will be structured to resemble the future format of the NCAA Championship tournament.
Friday’s stroke play will divide the field into top and bottom brackets consisting of eight teams each. Teams will then play two rounds of match play Saturday, and one round on Sunday, to determine the tournament winner.
The Women of Troy have winning experience with various combinations of starters, which will hopefully prove effective considering the absence of Park. Traveling to Georgia in the starting lineup will be junior Doris Chen, sophomores Kyung Kim and Victoria Morgan and freshmen Gabriella Then and Karen Chung. Chung, who hails from Livingston, N.J., recently won her first collegiate event at USC.
USC women’s golf team is ranked No. 1 in the country for many reasons, an important one being their depth. The loss of Park is expected to present some adversity for the team, but the Women of Troy have consistently proved that they can compete at any level with many different members of their team.
USC will hope to add to its record-breaking season this weekend in Athens, but as usual, they will face some of the nation’s toughest opponents during the competition. In addition to host Georgia, the tournament will include No. 6 Alabama, No. 7 Arkansas, No. 16 Northwestern, No. 21 Iowa State and No. 22 Michigan State, as well as other competitive teams from across the country.
Play begins at 8 a.m. each day and can be followed live on birdiefire.com.

There is a long-held formula for success in Major League Baseball, which says that a good team should strive to win two-thirds of their home games and play .500 ball on the road. Over the course of a 162-game MLB season, a team doing just that will win about 95 games — highly respectable, and a surefire playoff berth.
Home sweet home · Sophomore RHP Kyle Davis emphasized the Trojans’ desire to win in front of their home crowd this season. Davis leads the Trojan pitching staff with a 0.47 ERA in 11 appearances this season. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
That math cannot be extrapolated literally to collegiate play due to its comparatively short 56-game season and imbalanced schedules, but the formula itself can be. And USC baseball so far has only lived up to half of the bargain.
What I’m saying here is no great secret. USC has a mere 10-8 record at home this season, and an 0-3 mark at home in Pac-12 Conference play.
The Trojans know that if they are going to have the success many projected them to have, they need to take care of business within the friendly confines of Dedeaux Field.
“We’re supposed to win at home,” sophomore pitcher Kyle Davis told Annenberg TV News on Monday. “We just need to protect our home field and know what we have to do here because we have a different mindset here.”
Indeed, for the Trojans to have any success in the arduous Pac-12 conference this season, they know they cannot afford weekends like this past one. The Trojans were swept at home by the Washington Huskies, suffering a pair of blowouts (an 8-2 loss followed by a staggering 19-4 loss) to start the weekend before a disheartening 14-inning affair in the finale on Sunday.
The Huskies, as it turns out, are one of the better teams in a very good conference, currently sitting atop the Pac-12 by two games with an 8-1 record. USC’s 3-6 record slots them ninth in the conference.
What made this past weekend all the more disappointing for USC was the Trojans’ success on the road to open their conference slate. The Trojans went 3-3 in trips to Oregon and Stanford, taking one from the Ducks in Eugene and earning an impressive series win in Palo Alto, complete with a come-from-behind extra-innings win in the Sunday finale.
That’s .500 ball on the road, and as previously mentioned, that gets it done.
USC heads to Tempe, Ariz. this weekend, and after that they leave Los Angeles just once more this season for a trip up to Pullman, Wash. to take on Washington State in early May. In fact, after this weekend, 12 of the Trojans’ 18 remaining conference games will take place at Dedeaux. In total, 15 of their remaining 23 games will be played at home.
Assuming the Trojans can keep splitting road series, their fate will come down to how they play at home.
They welcome Utah and Arizona in their next homestand, the only two teams lower than USC in the current Pac-12 standings. To say the Trojans need to finish those six games with something more than a 3-3 split is a dramatic understatement.
This is a Trojan team that many expected to see in a regional come postseason play. It’s still early, but so far it would be a lie to say the Trojans are on track to do that.
Right now, they’re looking like a .500 baseball team. Sadly, a .500 record would actually make them one of the better USC teams of the last decade, but it is not the team that was expected back in February. The Trojans started the season with seven straight wins, an impressive streak that included a 6-1 victory over third-ranked Cal State Fullerton.
There’s still two grueling months of Pac-12 play left for the Trojans to prove themselves. But that needs to start sooner rather than later.

USC’s No. 1 women’s sand volleyball team will look to outplay unranked LMU and sixth-ranked UCLA in some doubleheader action today at 1:30 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. in Merle Norman Stadium.
Sandy and dandy · Senior captain Kirby Burnham, who won the pairs title last year with Stevi Robinson, has led USC on court one this season. – Tucker McWhirter | Daily Trojan
 
The Women of Troy (10-1) are looking to continue their nine-match winning streak and will be honoring five seniors: Mary Buckingham, Kirby Burnham, Brooke Fournier, Sam Hirschmann and Natasa Siljkovic.
These five seniors and their teammates will look to attack fast and get some quick points up on the board, as they’ve done all season.
USC’s top duo of Burnham and freshman Sara Hughes has achieved 10 straight victories, bringing the pair to an impressive 18-3 on the season. They will look to improve their record this Thursday against two tough top teams in LMU’s Betsi Metter and Litara Keil and UCLA’s Kamila Tan and Jessyka Ngauamo.
On court two, Kelly Claes and Alexa Strange have won the most important point in five of the Trojans’ nine consecutive victories. They are 14-4 together on the season.
USC’s No. 3 pair, Hirschmann and Siljkovic (11-6), and No. 4 pair juniors Ever Ettinger and Bria Russ (12-4) have also been consistent forces for the Women of Troy and will hope to tally two wins tomorrow over the Lions and Bruins.
Freshmen Nicolette Martin and Allie Wheeler are 11-3 together on court five for the Women of Troy. Martin and Wheeler have proven to be very dangerous both offensively and defensively in their first season at USC, and will be a very successful pair for the Women of Troy heading into their sophomore years.
UCLA (6-3) will come to Merle Norman Stadium ranked No. 6 in the national polls as they look to bump up their ranking and improve on their season record. The Bruins are coming off of a 5-0 win over Stanford, and are likely determined to rack up a win against their crosstown rivals. Before topping Stanford in Palo Alto, Calif., the Bruins took a disappointing 5-0 loss to third-ranked Hawai’i.
LMU (4-6) lost the front end of a doubleheader last week in a close 3-2 decision to Long Beach State, but rebounded later that day with a 4-1 win over the Cal State Northridge Matadors.
The Lions will have to bring their A-game to the match if they want to avenge the 5-0 loss they suffered at the hands of the Women of Troy earlier this season.
Both LMU and UCLA are in desperate need of a win as the home stretch of the 2014 season comes closer. The two teams will face off against each other at 3 p.m. in Merle Norman Stadium, in between USC’s two matches.
Last week, the Women of Troy beat No. 1 Pepperdine for the first time in program history, and they are feeling stronger than ever heading in to their matches tomorrow. USC followed up that 4-1 win over the then-top-ranked Waves by beating Cal State Northridge and Oregon, and will hope to that momentum into today’s doubleheader.
The Women of Troy will look to extend their ten-game win streak and come one step closer to the AVCA championships in Gulf Shores, Ala. The Trojans will face the LMU Lions today at 1:30 p.m. and the UCLA Bruins at 4:30 p.m. in Merle Norman Stadium.
All of today’s matches will be streamed live on the Pac-12 Networks with Anne Marie Anderson providing play-by-play and three-time Olympic beach volleyball player Holly McPeak as the color commentator.

With a chance to clinch a spot in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament on Saturday at Pepperdine, the men’s volleyball team enters this week with a lot of excitement. But first, the Trojans hope to send their seniors off with a nonconference win against Concordia tonight in the final regular season home game of those seniors’ career.
Super senior · Senior opposite Tanner Jansen will be one of five seniors playing their last matches as Trojans at the Galen Center tonight. In his final season at USC, Jansen has recorded 3.71 kills per set, good for second on the team. Jansen sat out of the last meeting between USC and Pepperdine. – Benjamin Dunn | Daily Trojan
“There’s just a little more urgency for the Pepperdine game because it is in conference,” junior setter Micah Christenson said. “No disrespect to Concordia — they’re a very good team in their league —  but we’re gearing up for the MPSF tournament.”
USC head coach Bill Ferguson said that redshirt senior opposite Tanner Jansen, senior libero Henry Cassiday, senior outside hitter Maddison McKibbin, redshirt junior libero/outside hitter Paul Yoder and redshirt junior outside hitter Joey Booth will all either start or feature prominently in the rotation as tonight’s game will be the team’s Senior Night. Though Yoder and Booth both have a year of eligibility left, they are academically seniors set to graduate this year instead of returning for a fifth year of school.
Concordia (26-5, 4-1 Golden State) plays out of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, not the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The Eagles are the defending national champions in the NAIA, but were defeated in straight sets both times they played MPSF teams this year. Concordia fell in three sets to UC Irvine (16-9, 13-8) and UC Santa Barbara (14-7, 13-7) this season. USC (15-9, 14-9) split both matches with UC Irvine and UC Santa Barbara this year, with all four of those matches going five sets.
Following the final home game, the Trojans will have one day to fully prepare for a game that might be the final game of the 2014 campaign for USC or could springboard the Trojans into the postseason with a lot of momentum. The Trojans currently stand in seventh place in the MPSF standings. In the 13-team conference, the top eight qualify for the MPSF tournament. The winner of the MPSF tournament receives an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament, and Ferguson expects that two other teams from the MPSF will receive wild card bids to the tournament.
Three of the teams immediately behind USC in the standings have all played fewer games than the Trojans and could leapfrog the team in the standings with strong finishes to their seasons. The Trojans can guarantee a minimum finish in the top eight with a win over Pepperdine, though they still have a chance to make the playoffs if they lose to Pepperdine depending on how the remaining competition in the MPSF plays out.
Pepperdine (15-6, 15-6) defeated USC at the Galen Center on Jan. 16 in four sets by a score of 26-28, 25-22, 25-22, 26-24. The Trojans are ranked No. 8 in the American Volleyball Coaches Association poll, with Pepperdine coming in at No. 3.
Ferguson said that the team is excited about the chance to have some time off from playing to focus on things in practice and get some rest for the upcoming potential playoff run.
“I’m really fired up,” Ferguson said. “We’ve got one more league match left, everybody else has got, like, three or four. We’re going to really be able to go back to work next week and work on a lot of technique and getting ready for the playoffs.”
Christenson reiterated his coach’s eagerness about the push for the playoffs.
“I’m very excited,” Christenson said. “Last year, we didn’t actually get the privilege to make the tournament. Just that shot to get in and win three games in a row against the best eight teams in the league, it’s going to be fun.”
USC’s most recent road trip featured away games at Stanford and Pacific. The Trojans were unable to handle Stanford, losing to the Cardinal in four sets in a 25-21, 25-23, 22-25, 25-20 decision on March 27. The Trojans rebounded the following day, however, with a four-set win over Pacific by a score of 20-25, 25-20, 25-21, 25-20. The Trojans fell to Stanford in straight sets earlier this season at home by a 25-15, 25-14, 25-22 score on March 9 but swept Pacific on the season after a straight-set victory on March 7 by a score of 25-20, 25-22, 25-15.
“I don’t think we played that bad against Stanford, both teams just came out really flat,” Christenson said. “But they’re the hottest team in the league, if not the country, right now.”
Both the Concordia and Pepperdine games both start at 7 p.m.

Several days ago, a survey by the Associated Press in Time Magazine found support for President Barack Obama’s signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act, at 26 percent (its lowest in its four-year lifetime). The national media howled, including this excerpt from a Fox News article:
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
 
“President Obama is struggling to stop the steady slide in public support for his health care law, as yet another poll shows public approval of the law — and his job performance — hitting a new low.”
Fox has already eaten their words when the ACA was ruled constitutional, but this time it’s even more delicious. Reading a little deeper into the poll’s subtext could have predicted what was coming next. First, just 13 percent wrote that they thought the law would be repealed. Second, 56 percent said frustrations stemmed from problems with the website for them or a member of their family. As the deadline to sign up for insurance without a penalty passed, something remarkable happened: The website held up, and people’s opinions on the law seemed to change faster than the underwear they were wearing during the last poll.
By the deadline’s arrival, a Washington Post/ABC News poll showed that for the first time in 20 polls, more Americans supported the ACA than opposed it, if only by a slim margin of 49 percent, compared to 48 percent who were opposed.
The wild swings in polling demonstrate two things. First, problems such as the website’s rollout have a huge impact on temporary popularity of a law, but the law critics will have to rely on attacking more fundamental tenets of the law if they want to have any hope of repealing or modifying it. Second, the Republican Party’s over-reliance on criticizing the ACA will hurt their potential in the 2014 midterm elections.
Speaking in the Rose Garden Tuesday, President Obama reported that over 7.1 million Americans have signed up for healthcare since the rollout of the insurance exchange last October. This is significant because despite the glitches with the website, the number beats both the White House’s initial projection by 100,000 and the Congressional Budget Office’s projection by a million.
As long as President Obama is able to announce numbers like this, the law doesn’t stand a chance of being repealed. Arguments that seek to explain if and when health insurance costs will go up because of the law aren’t persuasive until such dire predictions come true, and solutions that call for a rewrite of the law with nothing but the statements of insurance companies to back them up can’t sustain momentum given the volatile poll numbers cited above.
The problem is also that those solutions aren’t politically feasible — thumping American swing voters over the head with healthcare economics might win Nobel Prizes, but it does not win elections. Shocking as it may seem, the vast majority of Americans have never read Nobel Prize-winning research.
Regarding the upcoming elections, it would be difficult to dispute the fact that Republicans will make gains in both the House and the Senate — structural political factors (more Congressmen are up for reelection in districts that President Obama lost in 2012 than in districts he won, for example) have already determined that. But a dependence on criticizing the ACA could be problematic, especially considering the two points of attack with the most political salience.
The first is an argument that has yet to be proven. Because the law relies upon younger, healthier Americans enrolling (to balance the cost to companies of insuring more unhealthy people), if a significant amount of “young invincibles” don’t sign up, healthcare costs will rise. Only time will tell if this happens, but it’s a risky bet — if the statistic goes the other way, President Obama will get to crow in the Rose Garden again, and that won’t be good for the GOP.
The second is a report by the Congressional Budget Office, which was released at the beginning of 2014 and sought to explain that the ACA would cost the United States over two million jobs. As I wrote then, that report is misleading because it estimated Americans would work less hours, not lose their jobs. Consider now this quote from Doug Holtz-Eakin, a former director of CBO, which appeared in the Washington Post, “At some level you have to take your hat off and say congratulations,” said Holtz-Eakin. “It’s an interim accomplishment at best.”
The worst part is, the GOP should already know this. Remember Mitt Romney? He certainly remembers. In his first interview after losing the presidential election, he said this, “I think the Obamacare attractiveness and feature was something we underestimated, particularly among lower incomes.”
The GOP should be careful not to let history repeat itself. If they do, they could have two more years in the minority to think about it.

The Democrats need to acknowledge that their leaders are misleading Americans with the 7M figure.  How many of the enrollees were previously insured and lost their plans that were sold in the individual insurance market?  They had no choice but to re-enroll under the ACA.  That does nothing to help the “uninsured.”  And how many of the enrollees have failed, or will fail, to continue payment of their required premiums?  That will directly impact the “affordability” of the ACA when the risk is not spread widely enough.  As a student journalist, you should learn to question government figures because our leaders often mislead us to achieve political goals that have nothing to do with the policy at hand.
Nate,
A good article. But ask your professors, “do our two American parties ever acknowledge the good actions of each other?” He will tell you “almost never.”
Praise the other party? It makes no sense for the GOP to do this. That is not the way parties compete. Attack! Attack if a criticism will help If the situation were reversed, the Democrats would behave likewise.
What the GOP could do to be helpful, is to find areas of improvement where they will then craft good, workable solutions and the legislation to improve ACA (“ObamaCare”). This could be a fine contribution without praising the opposing party.
ACA is law. With all of its flaws, it was well intended and it is the law. Instead of ranting and raving about repeal, the GOP could earn respect by constructive action rather than contemptible and futile whining. And my politics? I am middle of the road, was skeptical about ACA, but now that it has become law, I want to see it succeed and be an excellent social program for our country.
As far as repeal of the ACA, is it really a law when the deadlines change at the whim of the executive? How about when plans declared “illegal” are suddenly allowed for “one more year”? What about waivers to the president’s political allies? Weren’t the “Cadillac  Plans” supposed to be taxed? This is t he problem with creating law by summary. A 2000 page law becomes 20,000 pages of regulations. None of the people’s representatives were involved in shaping the regulations. The president did not sign the regulations. How do the regulations assume the force of law? Will the president really have his minions place people in federal prison over some regulation created in hiding away from the people?
The ACA a success? What were the “goals” of the legislation? Cover the 35M uncovered? Lower costs? Allow people to keep their plans and doctors? It is nice for the president to stand before a camera and declare “mission accomplished”. However at what cost? While there are great anecdotes of people getting covered for less – there are just as many of people getting covered for more. With a bit of digging it is easy to see that the government has added new tax burdens. One must realize that there is no government program that creates wealth or services spontaneously – all of government is cost shifting. In the end all must pay for what they get from government. We pay in $$$, time, less choice, resentment, and in many unseen ways.
Yes, the ACA is a success in creating confusion and reaping new tax revenues. However, those were not its advertised goals.

If someone was tasked with describing USC’s University Park campus, he or she would be remiss not to include an anecdote about the ever-present solicitors on Trousdale Parkway. It’s a rarity for anyone to walk through campus without seeing a sea of brightly colored vests stationed at every corner of campus, always enthusiastically thrusting petitions in the face of anyone patient enough to stop and talk to them.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
 
Often, these encounters begin with the occasional “Let’s change the world together,” or “You look like you care about dolphins.” For those students who don’t have the time to stop, they are left with two recourses —  either politely decline or try their best to avoid eye contact and look away so as to put off the inevitable guilt trip that follows the rejection. Though it’s one thing to lobby respectfully for a worthy cause such as Amnesty International or Greenpeace, it’s another thing entirely to verbally or physically harass students who are en route to their on-campus obligations.
Though I never used to have a problem with these solicitors, that changed this past fall when I was accosted by a group of petitioners who strategically blocked my entrance to the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. I was on my way to buy a last minute blue book for a midterm when an overly enthusiastic young man in a neon orange vest ran up to me and said, “You look stressed, let me give you a hug.” Being a big believer in both personal space and stranger danger, I politely declined and attempted to make my way to the bookstore and my subsequent midterm. But instead of letting me go, the solicitor continued to aggressively attempt to give me a hug, arms outstretched and getting way too close for comfort to the extent that I had to push his arms off of me and sharply demand that he leave me alone, to which he replied, “You don’t have to be such a b–ch about it.”
Instead of wasting more of my time dealing with him, I took the chance to flee to class and let it go for the moment. But later on, the more I thought about it, the more furious I became. What right does a random stranger have to physically and verbally harass me on my way to a midterm? Shouldn’t there be some way of protecting myself from this?
Interactions such as mine are unfortunately not uncommon. Claire Brunvand, a sophomore majoring in cognitive science, recalled a time when one Amnesty International man asked her if she had somewhere to be. When she said she had class, he reportedly started making obscene hand gestures near his genitals.
Sarah Bass, a sophomore majoring in chemical engineering, recalled another similar experience.
“One of them stopped me on my way to class and asked me if I’d sign a petition to save the dolphins, and when I said I had to go to class and couldn’t stop he yelled at me and called me an animal murderer,” Bass said. “It was aggressive, to say the least.”
Shannon Delijani, a freshman majoring in vocal performance, recalled a time when a man from Children’s International stopped her and started asking personal questions. Though she figured he was just doing his job and trying to get to know her before asking for money, the conversation became more and more uncomfortable.
“He kind of brushed it off and kept asking me questions about myself and my major and music things, and I was starting to get uncomfortable and tried to leave the conversation,” Delijani said. “One of my friends saw me and thought I needed help so she tried to come over and get out of it but the guy kept following us really aggressively. He ended up asking for my number, and I said no. When I didn’t give it to him he started yelling and kind of making a scene about how I was being rude to him and he was just trying to be friendly and started shouting. My friend and I ended up basically running away. I was pretty terrified.”
Such incidents, of course, are not indicative of every student’s experience with these solicitors. For many solicitors, their six-hour shifts on campus are meant to raise awareness — not disturb student life.
Of the average 30 people who stop to talk, only three or four actually sign up, according to a volunteer from Greenpeace on Trousdale Parkway. According to another volunteer from Amnesty International, approximately one in six students stop and talk to them (much more than the one in 10 average internationally).
“It started out as a job, but then I realized it’s great to see people getting inspired when you talk to them — it’s like a call to action,” a member of Greenpeace said. “My job description is to raise awareness to these people, offer a solution and invite them to be part of the solution and then live in it with me and four million people across the globe.”
Many solicitors politely ask for a moment of one’s time and simply move on if one declines. Many even wish you a good day. The problem, however, is that not everyone behaves this way.
Regardless of their good intentions and worthwhile causes, solicitors should not be given free reign to intrude on the daily lives of students beyond politely asking for a moment of their time. Allowing random and unscreened volunteers from a variety of organizations to openly pass judgement on students in their own academic environment isn’t conducive with learning or advocacy — it’s disruptive and only generates more apathy.

This is precisely why I walk with sunglasses and headphones everywhere I go on campus. I know they are just doing their jobs but there has got to be a better way to do it. People are typically trying to get from point A to point B without being interrupted by some random solicitor. I wish USC would monitor them more closely so that they would think twice before crossing the line.
This is absurd that the university allows this harassment to take place on its private property.  
We students need to feel safe on our own campus. I appeal to all concerned students to take this matter directly to the administration. There’s a certain amount of negligence occurring here on campus in this regard. When I told my father, the one paying my way, he freaked out and is discussing this with like parents in how to approach the school.
Really, this needs to be dealt with immediately.
Many of these solicitors are paid per signature that they get. I hate how they hassle you as you walk by. I wish USC reduces the number of non-USC groups they allow on campus. Being a female student, I do not need to be harassed on my own college campus.

The song “#Selfie” by the Chainsmokers has been securely in the top 20 most downloaded songs on iTunes for the past few weeks, and the accompanying music video has been viewed more than 40 million times on Youtube. It’s been quite an impressive run for a song that isn’t really a song at all. The music video, in particular, could more accurately be described as an extended internet meme. And as internet memes go, it serves its purpose quite well. It directly and humorously represents a cultural phenomenon: Selfies. But as with so many aspects of contemporary culture (particularly those that tend toward the nihilistic), it can be difficult to determine whether “#Selfie” critiques or celebrates the themes it represents.

The video depicts a young woman and her friend staring into a bathroom mirror (a popular selfie spot) at a hip nightclub. Fleeting scenes of the club are interspersed with her incredibly obnoxious and superficial internal monologue over a rhythmic baseline. Each spoken “verse” ends with the phrase, “Let me take a selfie” The subsequent “chorus” consists of a fast-paced onslaught of Instagram photos with the tag #selfie that automatically refreshes upon each viewing.
The nature of the young woman’s narration suggests that the song is indeed parodying selfies and what they represent in the contemporary youth experience. The Chainsmokers certainly must have been aware of the extent to which selfies have become a part of the cultural discourse, particularly since the Oxford English Dictionary declared “selfie” the word of the year in 2013. Just as in the video, most of the conversation about selfies centers on the role of young women.
Recent posts on Jezebel and Slate debate the value of selfies with regard to female empowerment. On Jezebel, Erin Gloria Ryan argues, “selfies aren’t empowering; they’re a high tech reflection of the f-cked up way society teaches women that their most important quality is their physical attractiveness.” Rachel Simmons of Slate, on the other hand, sees the selfie as a form of female empowerment; a “shout-out to the self.”
“#Selfie” embodies elements of both arguments, minus any notion of female empowerment. In fact, the song and video bring the discourse on selfies to a different level by suggesting that it is not the act of taking a selfie that is superficial and obnoxious, but that these qualities characterize the person taking the selfie. It is the selfie taker who is “f-cked up,” not the selfie itself. “#Selfie’s” portrayal of the selfie-taker, in this case a young woman, as petty and superficial can certainly be read as sexist, and may very well be analyzed as such by a site like Jezebel in the near future.
Yet, despite the apparent stupidity of the selfie taker as she is portrayed in the video, The Chainsmokers encourage their fans to participate in the silliness by posting their own #selfies on Instagram in the hopes of appearing in the video. “#Selfie,” it appears, isn’t sexist so much as it is nihilistic in the way it encourages such evidently flawed behavior.
The absurdity of “#Selfie’s” message (or lack thereof) is put into stark relief by a recent parody video by USC alumnus Jon Rudnitsky entitled, “#DICKPIC.” Even though it’s technically a parody, it’s not that much more ridiculous than the original. Rudnitsky and The Chainsmokers seem to share a certain artistic vision: Why participate in the cultural discourse when the issues being parsed out are so laughable to begin with?
