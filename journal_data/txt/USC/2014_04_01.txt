The Marshall School of Business announced on Tuesday that it will launch a new Master of Science degree focused on the study of business analytics.

Business analytics has risen in popularity over the last decade due to a number of factors, ranging from the unfiltered data streaming from social media sites to the increase in digital storage of information. Its newfound popularity is leading to a heighted awareness on the subject from a managerial perspective.
“Companies have to make decisions every day in areas such as human resources, procurement capital expenditures and real estate,” said Yehuda Bassok, chair of the Marshall department of data sciences and operations. “These are difficult decisions because we don’t know what’s yet to come and there is always uncertainty about the future.”
Many universities in the United States, such as USC, are developing master’s programs to discuss these issues that business leaders face in order to have a better understanding of the often complex and misunderstood topic.
Bassok noted, however, that USC’s analytical program stands apart from those in the rest of the country.
“We are quite unique in that we will emphasize the business application of analytics,” Bassok said. “This is unlike engineering schools that offer this type of program because they are more technical and will speak in greater detail to databases and how to structure databases, whereas USC will teach its students these topics, but more with a view of how a business should use them and what is the interest of the business community in these databases.”
This is the third new master’s program unveiled by Marshall this year alone. In the last two months, they also announced a Master of Science in social entrepreneurship and a Master of Science in entrepreneurship and innovation.
The program in business analytics will require 27 units and will begin accepting applications immediately for the upcoming fall semester. Marshall is targeting working professionals with bachelor’s or advanced degrees, along with graduating seniors from four-year baccalaureate programs. Both full-time and part-time study options will be available to those enrolled, and GMAT or GRE scores are required for all applications.
Foundation classes include  GSBA 524: “Applied Managerial Statistics,” DSO 510: “Business Analytics,” DSO 530: “Applied Modern Statistical Learning Methods,” DSO 545: “Statistical Computing and Data Visualization,” DSO 570: “The Analytics Edge: Data, Models, and Effective Decisions, DSO 573:  “Data Analytics Driven Dynamic Strategy & Executive” and INF 551: “Foundations of Data Management.”
“In an environment increasingly powered by big data, a thorough understanding of, and fluency in, business analytics is vital to success,” said Marshall Dean James Ellis. “This new degree will empower students with in-depth training that translates to significant positive impact.”
The goal for the incoming class size is around 30 to 35 students, with long-term expectations of nearly 50 to 55 students from a wide array of backgrounds such as media, financial services and engineering.
Dr. Basook said the field of business analytics is on the rise, and those who enter Marshall’s program will be well-prepared.
“Graduates of our program will be able to present findings in a simple way that business people can understand, and understand fast,” he said. “We believe there is a huge demand for people with this degree.”

Tuesday night’s USG meeting, which featured the swearing in of President Andrew Menard, Vice President Rini Sampath and the 2014 USG Senators, marked the end of the road for USG’s 2013 representatives and a new beginning for student government at USC.
Mr. President · USG presidential elect Andrew Menard is sworn in as USG student body president during Tuesday’s USG meeting. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
In a crowded gallery of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, incoming officials took oaths “to uphold the undergraduate constitution, by laws and code of ethics to perform any tasks and duties which they are delegated.”
After Vice President Ryan Park gave a farewell to the old USG senators, the new Senate had a brief meeting, overseen by Sampath.
The lone item on the agenda was a speech by Menard, in which he thanked his running mate and those who elected him.
“I’m truly humbled by the task before us, and honored by the trust the student body has placed before Rini and me,” Menard said.
Menard outlined numerous goals for his term, all of which rest on his pledge to faithfully represent USC student concerns, in dialogue with campus administration and elsewhere.
“The role of student government has always been to represent the voice of the student body,” Menard said. “As president I will initiate, coordinate and guide student efforts aimed at improving student life activities, and I will always fight for the preservation of student rights.”
Along with defending the interests of students, Menard wants to cultivate a greater sense of community on campus. He promised that his administration will work to reach out to students and form a more cohesive atmosphere at USC.
Lest one think these are empty promises, Menard says that changes he proposed are already taking place. Chief among these is a recently passed amnesty policy, designed to protect students who report medical emergencies from repercussions.
Though the vision expressed in Menard’s speech was expansive, it was checked by a basic sense of responsibility toward fellow students. During his time at USC, Menard said he has recognized a simple truth: the need for students to be kind and supportive of one another.
“Every day I believe that we are called to do small things with great love and intention for our fellow classmates,” he said. “We are all part of the Trojan Family, and together we will strive to improve our great university.”

On Monday, James Ellis, dean of the Marshall School of Business, announced that Elon Musk will be the commencement speaker for the USC Marshall Undergraduate Ceremony on May 16.
Musk’s resume is lengthy and impressive. He is the CEO and product architect of Tesla Motors and the CEO and chief designer of Space Exploration Technologies, commonly known as SpaceX.
Prior to his endeavors at Tesla and SpaceX, Musk co-founded and served as chairman and CEO of PayPal, the world’s leading Internet payment system. He also co-founded Zip2, a provider of Internet software to the media industry.
Musk  grew up in Pretoria, South Africa during the last decades of apartheid. When he was 17, he moved to Canada, and then began his studies at the University of Pennsylvania in 1992.
Musk received his bachelor’s degree in physics. He later received a second degree in economics from Wharton School of Business.
The response to Musk being announced as the Marshall undergraduate commencement speaker has been overwhelmingly positive.
“I’m super excited for him to be the graduation speaker,” said Hayden Furey, a senior majoring in business administration. “The company [I] worked with last summer worked with Tesla in the past and I’ve heard he is one of the most brilliant guys.”
Other students, such as Vincent Tsao, a senior majoring in business administration (cinematic arts), felt that Musk’s background in technology would resonate with many students, but that more importantly Musk’s experiences will apply to seniors interested in all areas of business.
“Musk is a huge player in terms of technology and innovation in general,” Tsao said. “I’m really excited to hear what he has to say about the future of technology and how graduating seniors are going to fit into that picture.”
Musk appeared on 60 Minutes this past Sunday. He spoke about his successes, failures and how his perceptions have changed.
“I thought we would most likely fail,” he told 60 Minutes about founding Tesla, but he elaborated about the value of perseverance.
“If something’s important enough, you should try,” Musk said.
Sounds like Marshall is a few years behind Viterbi…
Wow, this one is a homerun! SC Marshall got the ideal speaker for its business graduates. When Steve Jobs spoke at the ’06 commencement for Stanford…I was a little “envious.”
How’s it go?…”Those who are crazy enough to think they can change the world…” nevermind :)
Will the USC Marshall Undergraduate Ceremony on May 16 be live streamed?
Many thanks.

Those who were close to Haibo Zhang, a graduate student in the Sonny Astani Department of Civil Engineering, say he will be remembered for his passion for learning and adventurous spirit. The 24-year-old student drowned on March 17 while vacationing in Hawaii.
Remembrance · James E.Moore (left) served as Haibo Zhang’s (right) academic advisor and said he had an “impact” on campus. – Photo courtesy of Professor Thomas Booth
Zhang, a native of Xilinhaote, China, was planning to graduate in May with a master’s degree in civil engineering (transportation engineering) and a graduate certificate in transportation systems, according to a memorandum sent to graduate students and faculty by Kelly Goulis, senior associate dean at the Viterbi School of Engineering.
Zhang’s academic advisor and professor of industrial and systems engineering, James Moore, said Zhang characterized the ideal USC student.
“He was exactly [the] kind of student we like to have,” Moore said. “He was motivated, hard-working, intelligent and had a very positive, happy attitude. He’ll be missed, he had an impact here.”
Prior to attending USC, Zhang attended the Inner Mongolia University of Technology and graduated with a degree in transportation engineering. Zhang’s parents visited USC’s campus last week, and Viterbi faculty and students had a chance to meet with them, an opportunity Moore said he was grateful to have.
“It made us all feel closer to him,” Moore said.
Zhang demonstrated his eagerness to learn both inside and outside of the classroom. He frequently attended presentations by the Women’s Transportation Seminar, which was an excellent opportunity to connect to professors and employers in the transportation industry, Moore said.
Zhang’s friend and classmate Nicholas Lowe said Zhang showed a similar eagerness to learn about U.S. culture. Lowe said he will remember Zhang fondly for his sense of adventure and curiosity.
“He was always willing to go out and try new things he had never experienced before,” Lowe said. “Some of the international students are not like that, but he was willing to go out there and explore.”
Lowe recalled that the pair would explore areas of Los Angeles such as Chinatown and downtown, and also enjoyed playing mahjong together.
Additionally, Lowe said that Zhang was a great person to work with in the classroom, and that he made important contributions to the group projects they worked on together.
“He always wanted to do more than was expected of him and his calculations were always very thorough and done on time,” Lowe said. “He always asked questions about assignments to make sure everything was clear because he was so eager to learn.”
One of Zhang’s instructors, Eric Shen, a professor of civil and environmental engineering in Viterbi, witnessed Zhang’s eagerness to learn in his class. CA 585: “Traffic Engineering and Control.”  In the class of less than 10 students, Shen said that Zhang’s strong desire to  improve his English stood out.
“His reports would get a lot of red marks and grammatical corrections — because his English wasn’t that good — but he would often come to me and ask for advice and suggestions because he … was not embarrassed,” Shen said. “That struck me that he was really willing to learn. I felt that he would really go places because he was fearless.”

Maybe I just don’t get March Madness. Despite the fact that the Final Four matchups take place this weekend, the hype just doesn’t seem to interest me. The NCAA men’s basketball championships are a strange tournament, one where excitement seems to move in an inverse direction, contrary to the nature of typical elimination tournaments. Other sports that feature postseason elimination tournaments generate intrigue as they progress.
The argument for the interest behind the progression, and competitive tournaments in general, is that elimination tournaments are refining in nature. This means that in theory, the best team wins in the end. Multi-game series reinforce the notion, as is the case in the NBA. But the single elimination tournament in the NCAA, paired with a patently uninteresting brand of basketball, is perhaps the reason why the wave of March Madness crests a bit soon — around the same time that the NBA becomes interesting to watch.
The first reason why March Madness becomes such an interesting watch early on is due in large part to bracket pools. Let’s be honest: if it wasn’t for that one guy who chose his winners based on a school’s colors raking in the dough for the office pool, March Madness would be way less interesting. And yet year in and year out, this tradition sustains the early rounds of what is actually some mind-bendingly boring basketball.
College basketball relies significantly less on awe-inspiring displays of athleticism and individual players than the NBA. The college game is one of strategy  — coaches, systems, schemes and plays — as opposed to the NBA’s player-focused tactics. So-called basketball purists say this distills the game to its team-based roots, and they wouldn’t be wrong in saying so. But they would also be wrong in saying that this makes the game more exciting to watch. The strategic game detracts from the overall flow and offensive pacing of games, and the lack of big ticket athleticism pales in comparison to the NBA.
I am a fan of basketball in general, but the NBA just happens to be infinitely more fun to watch. Teams in the NBA build around the strengths of a single talent or a core group of talented players — not coaching systems or recruiting carousels. There’s a sense of security and predictability in the identities of individual players and teams that makes NBA fans feel more invested in their teams. But the NBA postseason is more interesting as it progresses: the fact that so much emphasis is placed on individual players’ legacies (LeBron James) or the potential dawn of a new era based on a single, unstoppable talent (Kevin Durant and the Oklahoma City Thunder), the Larry O’Brien trophy just seems like a far more coveted prize than an NCAA championship.
It certainly doesn’t help that the end of March Madness marks the beginning of the “actual” NBA season where the playoff races begin to heat up. There was a debate on ESPN First Take a couple years ago between Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith where they argued whether or not the last six weeks of the NBA regular season was more exciting than March Madness. Though it seems the general response would be March Madness, the debaters were split: ESPN analyst Skip Bayless chose the NBA, citing MVP races and postseason intrigue and the overall faster pace of the game.
Even in a season where my beloved Los Angeles Lakers occupy the territory between “lovably incompetent” and “outright tanking,” and when the MVP race this season between James and Durant has both sizzled and fizzled, the NBA playoff race remains one of the most compelling draws in sports. The dramatic impact of young players such as Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard are exciting new developments, and the postseason intrigue and the potential for a “Big Three Breakup” in Miami this offseason has most NBA fans on the edge of their seats anticipating free agency.
The March Madness tournament will end next Monday on April 7 — a little more than a week before the end of the NBA regular season on April 16. The NBA Playoffs will carry the torch of basketball hype well into June. As for college ball, a new national champion will be crowned and another college basketball season will end — not with a bang, but with a whimper.

As a reserve tight end and defensive end for Pete Carroll’s USC Trojans from 2006-2008, Gerald Washington won three consecutive Rose Bowl titles. Now, after a short stint in the NFL, Washington has embarked on a remarkably successful career in professional boxing. The 6’6” heavyweight is 11-0 with eight knockouts in his young career, and is signed by legendary manager Al Haymon, best known for his work with Floyd Mayweather. Daily Trojan Sports Editor Will Hanley sat down with Washington yesterday to discuss his time as a Trojan and his upcoming April 3 bout.

DT: How did you get into boxing as a kid?
Washington: I started boxing at the Boys & Girls Club in Vallejo. It was an after-school program, so you could just stay there and do your homework and then do the activities. There’s a gym in the back, and that’s where I started boxing.
DT: What made you give up the sport later?
Washington: I wanted to go into the service. I had four years of ROTC in high school, so after high school I pursued a military career.
 
DT: After your time in the Navy you began your football career at the junior college level before moving on to USC. What was your most memorable moment as a Trojan?
Washington: Just the day-to-day stuff, you know? All the work ethic I learned at the school, going out there under Coach [Pete] Carroll and learning how to compete. I used to always love walking into the stadium, doing the Trojan walk. That was always one of my favorite parts.
 
DT: After you played in the NFL for a bit you got back into boxing. What made you get back into the ring?
Washington: At first one of my friends from USC, Dominique Wise, told me about this program and that sparked an interest for me. I tried to get into the program, but they said I was too old. So I started boxing on my own, just using it to work out, then I started competing and sparring and stuff like that. I started doing well and then I just fell back in love with boxing and just ran with it from there.
 
DT: Were there any football skills that you learned that translated well into boxing?
Washington: I just have a strength that no other boxer has because of my football career. I’ll be stronger than any other boxer in the ring because of the way we worked out there at USC, and I’m able to use that and carry it over into boxing.
 
DT: Where does your career stand and when’s your next fight?
Washington: I’m fighting on April 3 at the Fantasy Springs Casino in Indio, Calif. I’m fighting this guy named Skipp Scott, he’s 6’8”, 270 lbs. His record is 16-1 with 10 KOs. Beyond that we take it one at a time, so after I’m done with this fight we’ll schedule the next one.
 
DT: Your nickname, “El Gallo Negro,” is unique. What’s the story behind the name?
Washington: I’m half Mexican, my mother is from Mexico, and the rooster is a fighting bird. I’m half black and half Mexican, so really I just put those two together. I grew up in Vallejo, Calif., but in eighth grade I went to school down in Mexico. So I speak Spanish, I’m bilingual, and that’s how that all came together.
 
DT: Your manager Al Haymon is a pretty well-known figure in the boxing world. What has it been like working with him?
Washington: It’s been great. This will be my third scheduled television bout and my career is moving along very well. I have a great trainer in John Pullman and they’re keeping my career very active and allowing me to move up the rankings faster.
 
DT: How is USC still helping you achieve your goals?
Washington: I’m just trying to get support from my Trojan family, you know. I love to have my people behind me. Chris Arreola and Bermane Stiverne will be fighting for the [WBC] world heavyweight title there at the Galen Center on May 10. I would love to stack the stadium with Trojans and be able to fight for the title there one day. I definitely want to keep in touch with you guys and keep it going, because I definitely want my Trojan family there behind me. I’m trying to get as many supporters out to the fight as I can. And I’ll be wearing USC, right there embroidered in my shorts.
 
DT: Lastly, what are your expectations for the USC football team next season?
Washington: I just look forward to Steve Sarkisian working with the team and bringing his magic back. I know that he’s all about business and they’re gonna do well and get the job done.

The USC football team didn’t waste any time fooling around on April Fools’ Day as they got back to work in windy conditions on Howard Jones Field on Tuesday.
Carrying the load · Redshirt junior running back Tre Madden has been a workhorse in USC’s last few spring practices due to an injury to his classmate Buck Allen. Madden ran for 703 yards in only six starts last season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
It is now USC’s third week of official spring practice, with the team looking strong after Saturday’s scrimmage.
Head coach Steve Sarkisian asserted that the team was a little sloppy on Tuesday and that it was definitely not the team’s best practice.
“We weren’t just as right as we need to be moving forward,” Sarkisian said. “But that’s why we practice and we’re not going to turn a blind eye to this.”
He looks forward to the team having a cleaner practice on Thursday.
The wind was also a factor, especially for the quarterbacks who were throwing the ball into it.
Quarterback Cody Kessler said he was undeterred by the wind, saying that he will use it as a learning experience moving forward.
“You get comfortable being uncomfortable, and it helps you get used to playing in different conditions when you play in different places,” Kessler said.
Grading the scrimmage
Sarkisian was most impressed with the running game on Saturday. USC ran the ball 70 times with only one healthy scholarship running back.
This meant a lot of work for Tre Madden as well as junior Jahleel Pinner, who got his first carries at tailback in the scrimmage.
“I don’t know if he will be a feature back for us, but he’s a guy that we know we can put in short yard situations,” Sarkisian said.
Kessler also went ahead and critiqued the offense’s performance in the scrimmage.
Most of the team’s problems continue to involve the timing of his throws and his receivers’ routes in the new up-tempo offense.
“I need to speed up a little bit, just with the sense of timing, just knowing where guys are going to be and that’s still coming on with this offense, still learning it,” Kessler said.
In an attempt to clean up some of their missed routes in practice, Kessler also said that he and Nelson Agholor practiced routes on Sunday, the team’s off day.
He also commended the performance of the offensive line protecting the quarterbacks in the scrimmage.
“Our O-line played really well and there were some sacks that were given up, but those guys picked up a lot of blitzes that they got thrown at,” Kessler said.
Injury Report
Tailback Javorious “Buck” Allen and safety Su’a Cravens were out of practice. Cravens was out with a sprained knee and Allen was out with a sprained ankle. Neither injury is anything serious, according to Sarkisian.
Redshirt junior wide receiver George Farmer reportedly tweaked his knee in the scrimmage on Saturday, but came back and looked fine in practice.

I have been flying a lot lately. As much as I love traveling in an aerodynamic, gravity-defying machine used to transport people, I am not a fan of all the crazy rules and regulations that are mandated. More than anything, what is the deal with the expensive airport food — or, if you’re on a long international flight, what is up with the meals they provide?
This past summer, I had the opportunity to go to Japan. Because I was on a 13-hour flight, I not only made the poor decision to stay awake the entire flight, but I also received lunch and dinner, which was not so appetizing. But food is food, I guess — for that I am grateful.
I could not help but notice the selection and the options available for those who have dietary needs — what if one of the passengers was vegetarian, vegan or gluten-free? I know that there were vegetarian options, but what I thought was funny was the presentation: Airplane food looks like cafeteria food and Lunchables had a baby.
I distinctively remember my dinner from my flight: The airline gave two options, chicken or beef teriyaki. My immediate thought was, “Oh great, which one is actually closer to being the real thing?”
I went for it and picked beef, thinking that I needed some red meat in my life when in reality, the meat was seemingly squishy and fuzzy — but I’m still alive, so it could not have been that bad. The beef teriyaki was a complete meal served with a mini green salad and a bread roll that had the consistency of plastic. We got a dessert, though I cannot remember what kind, and also a few condiments to make the passengers feel right at home — I guess that is what we get when we fly economy.
Interstate air travel is typically pretty short. For example, a flight from Los Angeles to San Francisco only allows the stewardesses an hour to get everyone his or her beverage of choice and two complimentary mini bags of lightly salted peanuts — yum. I like to spice things up on my flights and usually order a classy, non-alcoholic beverage such as ginger ale and also pray that they have those Biscoff cookies — I can live off of those things.
Following that statement, we can’t have it all when flying economy, but at least we get something.
Airports have a way of making me feel very apprehensive if I, by chance, have food in my possession; I never know whether I could bring my delectables into the terminal or just throw them away and waste food like all of the wasted plastic water bottles that are confiscated everyday. Luckily, there are solutions to every problem and for this I thank the Huffington Post and also The New York Times for some helpful tidbits of information as well as some tasty recipes to make your travel experience a pleasant one.
Michelle Higgins of The New York Times wrote a column about how we should “Pack a Picnic” for flights — a very clever idea indeed. Her piece basically touched upon all of the ways you can preserve and reheat food in an airport terminal or on your flight. Seemingly, whether the food is frozen, raw or old makes for very good food to eat on your trip, but I think the companies of the airplanes figured that out already.
Eating before your flight is always helpful, but for me, I always seem to get hungry during the flight. It’s almost like the lack of gravity eliminates the food from my stomach and uses it as fuel to help get the plane to its given location.
The Huffington Post nailed it when they published a list of do-it-yourself airplane food that can be taken on the plane. I love its assortment of nuts and grains, vegetables and fruits that can be brought on board. On my last flight, I had a large and delicious turkey and avocado sub in my possession but scarfed it down before I got to the airport — that was a mistake, because I wasn’t hungry and I could have brought it with me to the terminal.
Now you know some facts. You can bring food onboard, just no bottles containing any kind of liquid. I encourage you to save your money and like Michelle Higgins said, pack a picnic. But be forewarned — you could make people jealous.

Fitz Tepper, a sophomore majoring in business administration, released his latest iPhone application, HungerGrad, this week. HungerGrad, which is available on the iTunes App Store, allows students to receive big discounts at popular restaurants both on and off USC campus.

“HungerGrad allows USC students to eat out at their favorite restaurants, while never having to pay full price for a meal again,” Tepper said
What makes HungerGrad stand out from other discount-based apps is that restaurants partnering with HungerGrad offer different deals to users depending on the time and day of the week. This means you can open the app during each of the three major mealtimes and be greeted with a different list of specials each time. These discounts range from a free sandwich at Subway to a 2-for-1 drink special at the student-favorite 901 Bar and Grill.
This isn’t the first time Tepper has developed an iPhone app geared toward USC students. In spring 2013, Tepper and Max Whitehead created an application that many students might be familiar with — the Eat at USC app informs USC students about the dining options run by USC Hospitality. Though the two apps similarly focus on student dining, Tepper’s latest app adds a money-saving component. Furthermore, not only does HungerGrad deal with popular restaurants outside of USC Hospitality’s ownership, but it also allows users to receive discounts from sought-after restaurants around USC at practically any hour of the day.
Tepper said HungerGrad’s goal is to become a ubiquitous part of students’ everyday eating habits.
“As soon as you’re hungry, you should open HungerGrad,” Tepper said. You’ll immediately see a list of great specials from multiple restaurants around USC, which you can then go and instantly claim,” “The dynamic nature of the deals offered means that you should check HungerGrad as often as possible, as some deals are only available for a few hours at a time.”
HungerGrad is the end result of almost two years of work on food-related iPhone apps for co-founders Tepper and Whitehead.
“I always wanted Eat at USC to turn into an app offering student discounts,” Tepper said. “The problem was that restaurants weren’t willing to discount their food.”
This was something Tepper could sympathize with, as growing up working in his family’s restaurants allowed him to see first-hand how difficult it could be for a restaurant to be profitable. Thinking back to his experiences growing up in the industry, he finally found a solution.
“When we began pitching the ability for restaurants to push out time-sensitive deals during their slow off-peak hours, the response from restaurant owners was incredible,” he said.
HungerGrad then became a win-win situation for both the consumer and the partner restaurant; the consumer receives a great discount on food while the restaurant makes extra revenue during its slower hours. So far, eight restaurants have started offering deals via HungerGrad, with more eateries being added every week.
As of now, HungerGrad is available exclusively to USC students and is limited to restaurants near the University Park campus. Starting this summer, however, HungerGrad plans to spread its student discounts to other campuses, with UCLA and schools in Tepper’s hometown of Philadelphia next on the list. Though the technical barrier to adding new campuses is very low, Tepper’s main concern at the moment is creating a great user experience for his fellow students at USC. So far, his hard work has paid off, as evidenced by an increasing number of student downloads and deals being claimed.
“Last night, I walked into Bella Pita and actually saw someone in the process of using HungerGrad to redeem a discount on their meal,” Tepper said. “The original inspiration was through my own want to save money eating out, so it’s great knowing that this app is something helpful to other students.”
In February, Tepper entered HungerGrad into the initial round of the Marshall School of Business’s New Venture Seed Competition, a contest for entrepreneurs in the Marshall School to receive funding and support for their business ideas. Out of the 100-plus USC startups that pitched their business plans, HungerGrad made it to the final eight. On April 16, Tepper will pitch HungerGrad to more than 350 Marshall students and faculty in an attempt to win funding and support from USC. The results of this competition will be announced at the New Venture Seed Competition Awards Dinner on May 1 at USC’s Town & Gown.
When asked if he uses his own app, Tepper responded with a laugh.
“Of course. I’m actually in the middle of what I like to call the ‘HungerGrad Challenge,’ attempting to follow my app’s motto of never paying full price for a meal again by only eating at HungerGrad restaurants,” he said.
Even though he hasn’t determined how long he plans on following his “HungerGrad Challenge,” it shouldn’t be too hard with the expanding variety of restaurant deals being offered every week.
 
HungerGrad is available now for free on the iTunes App Store, or at HungerGrad.com
 
He needs to make these available on the Google PlayStore!!

It’s not very surprising that Mac DeMarco, being the gap-toothed goofball that he is, would release his latest album on April Fool’s Day. Salad Days, DeMarco’s sophomore effort, embodies the meaning of the “holiday” — almost nostalgic in nature, the record showcases his talent in a more grown-up light than his carefree and mischievous debut album, 2.
Soup or salad · Canadian rocker Mac DeMarco released his sophomore album on Tuesday through the label Captured Tracks. – Photo courtesy of purple.fr
So evolved is this album’s sound that it’s a mystery how DeMarco crafted Salad Days, an amalgamation of stoner-slacker-psychedelic rock, in his dingy Brooklyn apartment by recording each instrument on his own and recruiting friends as his backing band for tours.
DeMarco released Salad Days under New York label Captured Tracks, where his labelmates include DIIV, Wild Nothing and Beach Fossils. Oddly enough, the native Canadian doesn’t seem very cut out for work with record labels — the far-from-perfectionist work ethic and lazy slacker lifestyle manifested in his music isn’t normally thought of as conducive to musical success. Despite this incongruity, however, DeMarco went on to tour with famous French band Phoenix in 2013, boosting his popularity. DeMarco has carved out a niche for himself as one of the biggest names in indie rock, a poster boy of unlikely circumstances.
Over a span of just a few years, DeMarco has garnered an impressive cult following in the indie rock scene, especially by way of his outrageous onstage antics at live shows. An unabashed spirit prone to the occasional bout of public indecency, DeMarco has obviously been coming to grips with his overeager fans’ expectations of him, demanding he do something crazy during his performances. The song “Passing out the Pieces” addresses this issue in particular, as it makes his personal life public. DeMarco comes off as jaded when he sings, “I’m passing out pieces of me / Don’t you know nothing comes free?”
Another aspect of DeMarco’s life that has been unwillingly publicized is his relationship with girlfriend Kiera “Kiki” McNally. She is the subject of the track “Let My Baby Stay,” a slow, acoustic love song that serves as the album’s halfway marker as well as a much-needed tempo shift, paralleling a similar track on his last album, Still Together. In the song, he touches on Kiera’s immigrant status in the United States as a fellow Canadian and the government’s alleged attempts to deport her, imploring them to “let [his] baby stay.” Or, it might be a fabricated tale on DeMarco’s part in order to add to his growing mystique; either way, it’s definitely working.
Just as in his love ballad, DeMarco self-references his own pet name “Macky” on the track “Goodbye Weekend,” the most evocative of his work of all the tracks on Salad Days, with a guitar solo that could fit right into 2. In the song, he addresses critics of his life choices and eccentric mien, warning, “Don’t go telling me how this boy should be leading his own life / Sometimes rough, but generally speaking I’m fine.”
The title track, “Salad Days,” echoes the same sentiment of sad nostalgia overarching the whole album, opening with the lyrics, “As I’m getting older, chip up on my shoulder / Rolling through life, to roll over and die.” Despite the song’s cheerful, sunny melody the song’s melody, DeMarco’s lyrics reveal an underlying existential struggle with losing one’s youth, as he sings, “Oh mama / actin’ like my life’s already over / Oh dear / act your age and try another year.” The following track, “Blue Boy,” is no different — ordering his inner child to face reality, DeMarco sings, “No use acting so tough / Come down, sweetheart, grow up.”
Salad Days sees the novel use of the synthesizer in DeMarco’s arsenal of instruments in addition to the bright and highly-reverbed guitars previously heard on 2. Synths feature prominently on the track “Chamber of Reflection,” a funky bobbing bassline weaves throughout the song, reminiscent of 80s jazzercise techno with a lo-fi aesthetic, or even a gleaning of “chillwave” sounds from musical contemporaries like Toro y Moi or Washed Out.
Despite the successful effort to refine and mature his sound, it’s obvious that DeMarco retained his cheeky persona on Salad Days. At the same time, he stays true to 2 by reusing his shabby guitars and jerry-rigged effects pedals that give him his signature laid-back sound. Between songs, he can be heard muttering random notes out of context. At the end of the instrumental closing track, “Johnny’s Odyssey,” DeMarco leaves a heartfelt gem of a parting statement: “Hi guys, this is Mac, thank you for joining me, see you again soon, bye-bye.”
One thing is for sure: Mac DeMarco’s salad days aren’t quite gone yet.

KXSC Fest, a free music and arts festival put on by the student volunteers at KXSC Radio, was this past Saturday, March 29th and was a spectacular event. Few know that KXSC receives no funding from USC or USG.
Instead, KXSC paid the University more than $6,300 in required fees to host KXSC Fest, almost doubling our usual budget.
Though this annual festival has occurred each year without any major incident, changes in university policy following a certain on-campus incident in the fall of 2012 forced the event to an indoor venue and added a huge amount of required security personnel with a stifling price tag.
We also had to exclude non-university members from this indoor “festival.” The community was devastated and the event lacked the vibrancy and atmosphere of past years.
Since the chaos of the shooting has died down, we were back outside again this year, but with the same additional security costs. With no allocated budget and no supportive funds, we have to dig deep into our shallow pockets of savings, which come from weeks and months of fundraising and minimal station dues.
The cost for security for KXSC Fest in 2012 was zero dollars. The outdoor event ran smoothly and was held without incident. Two years later, this Saturday, the security costs for KXSC Fest are upwards of $6,300 in the same location, which includes DPS, CSC and fencing. The booking of 11 artists to perform costs roughly the same amount.
This burgeoning, healthy and necessary alternative community — cultivated and built by students — is now threatened by the very enterprise that is supposed to nurture it. Even highly visible and well-funded organizations like Program Board (who host SpringFest and Conquest) have seen their events threatened by these new security measures, yet the university has done nothing to lessen these additional internal costs.
Don’t get me wrong. I value the safety of my peers and myself, but the burden of these unexpected security costs has fallen completely on the student-run and non-funded organizations, as well as the funded ones. For anyone that has organized an event, they know that the costs add up — and these university-mandated costs are crippling events all across campus.
The financial burden is magnified because the framework of the security measures is vague. If you have an event that is open to the public, you need to check IDs. If its only open to USC students, you still need to check IDs. If you need to check IDs at an event then you need security and fencing. How much security is enough? Depends on the event’s “threat levels” determined by DPS on a case-by-case basis. Right, we’re confused too. These costs are unavoidable.
With no changes in the security policies, KXSC will be forced to move in a different direction, pulling away from the university. Other student-run organizations that make USC a welcoming place for many students will most likely follow suit. These necessary alternative communities, which the university ostensibly supports and advertises in their brochures, are now threatened by a bureaucratic labyrinth that should be an enterprise of support — not a headache.
KXSC would like to extend our most sincere thanks to USC Spectrum, Graduate Student Government, Trojan Events and Ground Zero for giving us the much needed and deserved support. If the administration really wants a diverse and culturally vibrant campus, an institution that empowers students and equips them with the tools to enrich not only their university but also the world — then they need to step up as well — and not suppress the groups with auxiliary costs, but rather cover those costs, or at least ease the burden.

As the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s March Madness draws to a close — and takes with it millions of adoring college basketball fans — the conversation surrounding student-athletes and how they are treated and perceived on college campuses is only just revving up.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
 
A different college sport, yet one just as lucrative as men’s basketball, has revitalized the conversation surrounding the rights that student-athletes are afforded. A decision by the National Labor Relations Board this past week allowed Northwestern University football players to unionize, according to CNN. This decision has the potential to change the way colleges, students and fans interpret the term “student-athlete.”
Students who play sports in college — especially at Division I universities — where practice and game schedules are demanding and performance expectations are extremely high, the athlete distinction of “student-athlete” sometimes surpasses the student title. But if Northwestern University football players do vote to form a union among themselves, the consequences and implications that come from having a union might detract more from lives than expected and will most certainly have consequences that roll over into the general student body.
The term student-athlete has always been tied to the economic and employment distinction of the athlete. It was first crafted by the NCAA in the 1950s after the widow of a Colorado football player who had died of a head injury tried to file for workmen’s-compensation death benefits, according to The New York Times. By designating participants in college sports as student-athletes, the NCAA helped dissuade athletes from considering themselves as workers and being able to access workers’ compensation benefits. Instead, the term implied that all enrolled students who play college sports are engaged in secondary activities that enhance their education. For example, their status is essentially the same as members of the debate team or the band. Their first job is not to be an athlete, it is to be a student. Everything else is gravy.
Yet the announcement coming out of Evanston, Ill. reopens the conversation of how student-athletes are viewed. According to the NLRB, if the players do form a union, they could start demanding compensation for injuries suffered during practice or games and get the opportunity to benefit from the Workers’ Compensation Act. This could challenge the way schools operate financially toward their athletes.
Despite the benefit workers’ compensation could bring to student-athletes, the method of gaining it through a union has many downsides. Unions are large organizations that, in an ideal world, serve the best interests of everyone in them. Because of their size and strict standards, however, they often come at odds with other large institutions that have their own interests and goals. In the case of the Northwestern football players, they would be up against an established university that has had decades of practicing its message. The uphill battle to break down the way the NCAA functions at Division I colleges might prove too much for the new union to tackle.
In addition, through the union, the individual voices of the football players would become one. If a student-athlete wants more freedom to express him or herself and explore during his or her college years, like in the case with Kain Colter at Northwestern, it seems counterproductive to join an organization that focuses on conforming ideas and interests.
No one would deny that the NCAA is a lucrative business. According to 2012 statistics, the NCAA made more than $10.6 billion in total revenue from games and tournaments from the more than 420,000 NCAA student athletes. Specifically for college football, the average amount of school revenue made reached up to $15.8 million per school. Yet if current student-athletes attempt to step into this bustling business world and transform it, it has the potential of taking away from their studies and other aims.
Furthermore, the right for football players to form unions affects more than just those student-athletes. Talk of a union should not just take place among the student-athletes. In many Division I schools, a portion of all students’ tuition goes to fund the athletic department. According to a 2010 USA Today study, approximately 23 percent of in-state tuition goes to fund sports. Therefore all students should have a voice in how a union of student-athletes will be organized on campus.
The decision by the NLRB is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the conversation of how universities treat their student-athletes and the power student-athletes yield within these universities. But as Northwestern football players — and student-athletes in general — move forward in redefining their role and rights, it is paramount to keep in mind that their decisions have ramifications that extend beyond their locker room. By joining a union, the responsibilities of maintaining one unified and all-inclusive voice becomes more challenging. In addition, it is important not to leave out the voice of other students involved in clubs that do not have the luxury of unionizing. When entering these unchartered territories, extreme caution should be taken before any call is made.
Just like in any college sport, thousands of fans and naysayers are watching and waiting for the next play to be made.
