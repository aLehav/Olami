Accountability, racial justice and the coronavirus were front and center topics at the Undergraduate Student Government senatorial forum Wednesday. Approximately 70 people attended the virtual event where 14 candidates, vying for 12 Senate spots, presented their campaign platforms and answered questions from the audience. Annenberg Media co-executive editor Chandler France and elections committee official David Martinez moderated the forum. 
Four candidates are running on their own, and ten candidates — or five pairs — are running as partners, sharing platforms and election resources. Voting will take place from Feb. 17 to 19.
Several candidates spoke about the need for increased USG accountability after the past year, in which the former president and vice president both resigned over the summer following accusations of microaggressions and complicity in racial misconduct.
Senatorial candidate Hana Li, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said she has “seen firsthand the ways that USG has previously failed our students.”  
“With everything that’s happened in the past year, I hope to provide the legislative branch with a new perspective, hold our administration accountable for their promises and bring about real change that every student will be proud of,” Li said. 
Nivea Krishnan, a freshman majoring in public policy and economics, and Russell Agustin, a freshman majoring in public policy, also cited the importance of higher accountability within USG, despite entering the University last fall. 
“There were a lot of issues that occurred over the summer and while we are freshmen, we definitely read up on these situations,” Krishnan said. “We want to prioritize transparency through all the work that we do, as well as the work that the other senators that are elected do as well.” 
Incumbent senator Kevin Gutierrez spoke about the way USG has improved the lives of students, while also mentioning where the organization has failed. 
“The free Lyft program has arisen from [USG], as have free bluebooks and a lot of other great resources for students,” said Guiterrez, a junior majoring in neuroscience. “This past summer was really an eye-opener. I saw that USG was a really great vessel for change, but at the same time, it’s not perfect. No family is perfect, and the Trojan Family is no exception. We have failed to live up to our values, both as an organization as well as the Trojan Family collectively.”
The candidates also spoke about racial justice, citing a need for a larger focus on diversity, equity and inclusion within USG and more action from University administration on racial justice issues. 
Hunter Hinson, a sophomore majoring in political science and communication, presented the idea of a USC History Fund, which would provide students and faculty resources to study USC’s history with race and identity, as well as its relationship with South LA.
Tommy Nguyen, a junior majoring in history, said that he and his running mate, Gutierrez, looked through @black_at_usc — an Instagram account created during the summer for Black Trojans to share their experiences with racism and microaggressions on campus — to see the changes that students want.
“What we want to focus on is to push the administration to divest from DPS and replace those funds into a special fund for [Black and Indigenous students of color], especially since they have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,” Gutierrez said.
Additionally, Gutierrez wants to investigate those who were explicitly named in posts on the @black_at_usc page. 
“It really is not fair and very, very harmful to students that these people that have been named are still teaching, still on campus,” Gutierrez said. “That is really unacceptable.” 
The senatorial candidates also discussed their plans to provide support for students regarding the coronavirus. With no set plans or timeline for the University to return to on-campus classes and programming, senatorial candidate Devin Ayala, a freshman majoring in environmental science and health, addressed the need to be involved in larger decision-making. 
“I obviously cannot guarantee that we’re going to be back in the fall or the spring, but I can guarantee that I will be part of the dialogue,” Ayala said. “I will bring students’ part of the dialogue into performing and making sure that the transition back to school is safe and effective.” 
Alyssa Delarosa, a junior majoring in psychology, attended the event and expressed frustration that there was not more discussion about financial aid for transfer students having transferred herself. However, she was impressed by the candidates who spoke about @black_at_usc, increasing diversity, standing up for USC staff and helping transfer students acclimate to the school.
“I definitely have my 12 [candidates] in mind,” Delarosa said. “It’s still early, it ain’t over ‘til it’s over, but I definitely, after tonight, I do have my 12 in mind.”

When the Rams were knocked out of the playoffs by the Green Bay Packers in the NFL Playoffs’ divisional round, lots of questions surrounded next season’s Los Angeles squad. 
Would they be able to replicate their league-best defense with pending free agents like safety John Johnson and cornerback Troy Hill likely leaving? Would the third-best offensive line be able to create similar gaps between the tackles next season?
However, the most important question was a simple one — who would be their starting quarterback?
Franchise quarterback and former No. 1 pick Jared Goff looked far from promising last season, throwing 20 touchdowns with 13 interceptions. At times, he was flat out awful. This was most notably on display when Goff had two interceptions and two fumbles against the Miami Dolphins in a stinker.
If this was not enough for the Rams to start shopping for a new man under center, Goff was benched for backup quarterback John Wolford. With the final game of the season approaching and the Rams needing a win to get in the playoffs, Goff broke his thumb, prompting Wolford to step in to save the season.
Not only did he save the day, but Wolford stole Goff’s starting job in the playoff game against the Seattle Seahawks. Unfortunately, he was knocked out of the game early on, prompting Goff to step in and get the victory. 
The celebrations ended there, however, as the Rams fell to the Packers a week later and the quarterback debate began once again. Goff was solid, throwing for 174 yards and a touchdown, but could not get the job done. 
Head coach Sean McVay silenced some doubts after the game saying: “Yeah, he’s the quarterback, right now.”
But we could see it coming, the trade was brewing and last Saturday it was finalized with Goff (and some draft picks) being sent to the Detroit Lions for veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford.
A former No. 1 pick himself, Stafford elevates the Rams into Super Bowl contention in the wild, wild NFC.
It’s a match made in heaven for Los Angeles — McVay finally gets a chance with a new quarterback and Stafford finally joins a stable franchise with championship aspirations. 
Stafford is also great friends with Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw and has a chance to deliver a title to the city just like Kershaw did last year.
Over the course of 12 years, Stafford played his way through five head coaches and only three playoff games, losing all three. Much of this mediocrity can be attributed to the failures of the Detroit Lions franchise rather than Stafford himself. 
The Rams are not yet a symbol of perennial postseason success yet, but they’re not far removed from a Super Bowl appearance, and they have fared much better than the Lions have since their return to L.A. With McVay able to work with the new gunslinging quarterback, they have a good shot of making a deep run next year. 
The receiving core of former Trojan Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp combined with rookie Van Jefferson and tight end Tyler Higbee also looks to be a blissful offering for Stafford. He’ll fit right into the offense McVay has built through the years — an offense reliant on the run game to transition the team into play action.
The Rams also have an outstanding running back in second-year player Cam Akers who blossomed as a starter late last season. Against the New England Patriots last season, Akers ran for 171 yards, the most ever by a rookie against the Patriots.
Akers will no longer have to run for 171 yards for the Rams to win a game. Stafford is more than capable of closing out a game late or carrying them against a fantastic run defense. 
He can throw it deep; he can toss it short; he can laser it through defenders; but most importantly, he can do something Goff failed to consistently do with the Rams — find a way to win the game through the air. 
The 6-foot-3 quarterback has 38 game winning drives in his career compared to Goff’s mere eight. Granted, Stafford has been in the NFL since 2009, but having 14 more drives than the great Aaron Rodgers is something to mention. 
For the Rams it’s simple — they finally have a quarterback to lean on. 
Stafford has the weapons at his disposal for a run in the playoffs. It’s only a matter of time before he unloads them and rams through the NFL.

At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Dr. Diana Ramos started her position as board president of the Orange County Medical Association, taking a strong stance on adherence to public health guidelines. Long before then, she got her roots in her community in Los Angeles, then USC, where she grew her passion for solving health care inequalities.
Ramos seeks to attack the problem of health care disparities from every angle, with methods varying from outreach at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and USC Latino Alumni associations and educational programs to text message awareness campaigns. 
Ramos grew up in an area of L.A. where access to health care was an issue identified by “social determinants of health,” a term within the field that describes markers of socioeconomic gaps in a community’s health. Poor housing availability, domestic violence or even a lack of public walkways can all be indications of a population struggling with accessibility, according to Ramos. 
“For me, personally, growing up in that environment was a driver to pursue an education and to get out of the environment. So I always remember where I came from and I try to help my community, not only by doing outreach but also by doing a lot of educational programs,” Ramos said. “Lack of knowledge in terms of your health is also a deterrent to overall life improvement.”
To Ramos, the solution lies in education, which she thinks will open up avenues to further action. Toward that end, Ramos said she majored in communication at USC because she believes effective communication with patients can be a source of medical education, and frequently participated in peer-to-peer mentoring in order to sharpen her skills. 
Taking this dedication to her service as an officer on the board of directors for the Orange County Medical Association, Ramos started out as secretary treasurer for the organization and made her way to board president in 2019, making her the first Latinx person and woman to hold the position.
“[It’s] a lot of responsibility … I [was] honored,” Ramos said. 
A local reputation for accomplishment preceded Ramos, according to Jim Peterson, executive director of the OCMA, who worked alongside her during her time at the board. 
“I knew of [Ramos] even before I came to Orange County,” Peterson said. “Ramos is a great leader, a great physician as I’ve heard and is probably  even a better person. She’s very inclusive, very engaging, very positive [and] enthusiastic. She makes everyone around her feel better about what they’re doing.”
Ramos was president at the start of the coronavirus outbreak in Orange County, taking a strong stance on the importance of following suggestions from public health officials. According to CBS news, Orange County’s Chief Health Officer Nichole Quick resigned following personal attacks and threats from residents for her mandatory mask mandate issued in late May. Peterson said Ramos publicly condemned the backlash the next day, and reiterated the public health field’s support for face masks. 
A native Angeleno with strong connections to her community, Ramos knew she wanted to go to USC as early as twelve years old. 
Her desire to attend materialized when she attended one of the legendary USC vs. UCLA football games after her aunt, a waitress at the Town and Gown dining hall, gave Ramos VIP tickets that she was gifted from a Board of Trustees member. Along with her cousin, 12-year-old Ramos witnessed the city’s infamous football rivalry from front row seats. 
“You saw all the blue and yellow on one side and all the Cardinal and gold, …and I said, ‘This is where I want to come to school,’” Ramos said. “I could see the students, I could see the passion and [hear] the marching band.”
A communication undergraduate active in both the pre-med honor society Alpha Epsilon Delta and the hostess society Helenes, Ramos’ ambition for public service made her a stand out candidate when she attended the Keck School of Medicine. There, she was noticed by Dr. Raquel D. Arias, current associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology and associate dean of admissions at Keck.
“Even at that time, we could all see that she was a shining example of exactly what the school stands for and what we were delighted to have at the medical school,” Arias said. “She represents the very best that the school has to offer in every way.”
Both private practice and public health initiatives make integral contributions to everyday health, Arias said. However, the work Ramos engages in with addressing the disparities in health care has become more urgent now than it has ever been.
“That’s why [Ramos’] work is so important,” Arias said. “[The places where physicians are dramatically low compared to the patients being served] are becoming larger, not smaller, and the people who occupy those places tend to be people from historically underrepresented groups.”
For Ramos, it’s important to remember that there’s always a way forward. Regularly attending Latino Alumni Association meetings, Ramos continues to engage with the community and members on the importance of representation in the field of public health. 
“I think diversity is critical … The more perspective we get in society, the better solutions we can come up with — whether you’re Black, Native American, LGBTQ+,” Ramos said. “Nothing good comes easy … Remember to enjoy every experience because one day you will look back and realize what you were going through was actually a really good time.”

What do Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and race all have in common? They’re lies. Fed to you by your parents, who were fed by their parents. And if you have children, you’ll probably feed them the same. 
Before delving further into our own societal problems, let’s talk about dogs. Great danes, chihuahuas, huskies — they could not be more different. Yet they are members of the same species canis lupus, and more specifically the subspecies canis lupus familiaris. If species is the most specific taxonomic classification, then what are breeds? They are classifications based on physical similarity — resulting from generations of selective breeding — which breeders created to distinguish their product. 
Put another way, it’s a concept created by people to distinguish between dogs based on how they look — a label from which we can profit. This situation is directly applicable to people. Biologically, we are all the same species. There is absolutely no scientific evidence to support the contrary. 
This is the part where someone in the back brings up the thing with the skulls. Now, this is important — it’s how we identify the racists.  
“Race” did not exist until the late sixteenth century; it’s a derivation of scientific ignorance, inflated ego and the need of a moral justification for slavery. 
In 1779, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach concluded in “Decas craniorum” that the human species is made up of five races: Caucasian (white), Mongolian (yellow), Malay (brown), Ethiopian (Black) and American (red) — based on his examination of 60 skulls. He also spread the “degenerative hypothesis,” which was that Adam and Eve were Caucasians in Asia, and all other races degenerated from Caucasian into their current state due to environmental factors, namely sun exposure and poor diet.  
Like any other expression of power and exceptionalism, Europeans took this idea and ran with it. Craniology, or the study of human skulls, became a justification of white supremacy. People of color were labelled as mentally and morally inferior. Until then, people were identified based on culture or religion — physical attributes were often related, but not limited to these groupings. However, people could always convert religions or become part of a new culture. There needed to be some easily identifiable, innate differentiation between those who were on top and those at the bottom. 
Building off Blumenbach’s theories, pseudoscientists like Samuel Morton — a U.S. doctor in the early 19th century — derived a hierarchy of intelligence: first Caucasians, followed by East Asians, South Asians, Indigenous people and finally Black people. Morton’s ideas were taken as fact, adding to the ever-growing pile of excrement known as “racial anthropology,” and from that point on, it’s been a human centipede situation: swallowed from one generation to the next.
It’s very easy to distance oneself from unsavory aspects of the past, to blame mistakes on the past being ‘‘a different time.’’ The latter part is undeniably true; things have indeed changed since then; now lynchings happen in the courtroom and not the town square; legalese is used instead of a noose — yet the crowd of watchers is just as big. Mistakes must come before progress; however, it is only by willful ignorance or malicious intent that someone of this ‘‘modern era’’ would continue to follow the superstitions of the dead. 
Now, this is not an argument for the ‘‘I don’t see color’’ camp. Not only is the notion of skin color blindness ridiculous, it is downright dehumanizing. Ignoring people’s physical differences means disregarding the challenges they face due to the institutionalized systems of inequality in this country.
The discussion above may seem to be a purposeful complication of identity. This is partly the case. However, this is because the issue is worth discussion. It is the world of academia that invented these problematic terms to divide their fellow human beings into neat categories. Notwithstanding this country’s long standing affinity for pretentious old white men, the longer we blindly follow outdated concepts under the veil of anti-racism, the longer we perpetuate the lie of U.S. equality. It is impossible to combat the institutions of racism without recognizing that race itself is one of them.
Until there is a reformation of what it means to be Black or white, Asian or Latinx — not of different races but different people of the same, human race — there is no hope of effectively combating this issue of inequality. 
So how does such a fundamental change come about? As with all issues of corruption, it is necessary to go to the source. In this case: the education system. There’s the education kids receive at home — which no one can control — and that which they acquire at school. If parents choose to send their children to private institutions, they do so knowing that the curriculum can diverge from the standardizations dictated by the federal department of education. Despite how concerning a creationist-based “education” is, there is nothing to be done about that; thus, the weight of the future is placed on the malnourished shoulders of the public school system.
President Joe Biden recently appointed Miguel Cardona, Connecticut education commissioner, as the U.S. Secretary of Education. While hopes are high, this is a tall order. It remains to be seen what steps will be taken towards reforming this country’s broken educational system. 
And yes, it is hard to think about these things. Splicing beliefs which are ingrained into our society is difficult — it involves directly challenging the system of power that rules our lives.
It’s uncomfortable when our beliefs are challenged. Stay comfortable in racism, or allow that discomfort to push you into action. 
Like the saying goes: you reap what you sow. So sow the seeds of change, and feed their fruits to future generations.

When I’m home for winter break, there’s nothing better than unwinding after a long day of doing nothing by watching some HGTV. For those of you in need of recommendations, some of my go-to shows include Fixer Upper, Property Brothers, House Hunters International, Flip or Flop, Hawaii Life and my latest discovery, Island Hunters. 
I have to admit that I’m somewhat ambivalent about Island Hunters, the visuals and locations are undeniably stunning, and the premise is simple — a perfect show to indulge in without expending too many brain cells. The host Chris Krolow takes his wealthy buyers to three different island properties with the goal of buying one for themselves. However, it gets a little more complicated. Oftentimes, his clients aren’t just searching for their own private getaways — many enterprising millionaires are also hoping to establish boutique hotels and eco-resorts on these virgin parcels of tropical land. 
Krolow’s clients are flown in on helicopters or sail to private beaches by yacht, talking casually about developing land in South America, the Caribbean, Alaska, the Pacific Northwest and (to a tech bro’s excitement and my chagrin) even a completely untouched island off the coast of Torres del Paine National Park in Patagonia. 
While the purpose of ecotourism is to educate visitors about the conservation and preservation of the environment, it’s utterly hypocritical of entrepreneurial multimillionaires and their developers to construct lavish resorts on immaculate — and in some cases, protected — pieces of land. A line needs to both exist and be drawn. Is it really necessary to build excessive, questionably sustainable villas and getaways in the middle of pristine nature sanctuaries, supposedly in the name of environmentalism? 
Ecotourism, if practiced correctly, has many upsides. Recent years have led to increased popularity in traveling responsibly to fragile and rare ecosystems off the beaten path, staying in low-impact hotels and hostels and interacting with protected environmental areas in ways that encourage cultural immersion and environmental stewardship.
Increased traffic to remote areas guarantees more economic flow and increased employment opportunities for locals. Additionally, it incentivizes the need for both governments and locals to protect fragile habitats or natural landmarks that are attractions and be proactive about natural resource management so that it continues to be a source of income. Additionally, ecotourism allows for more money that can be put towards the management and protection of such delicate ecosystems. However, as the industry expands, so do the problems that come along with it. 
While more tourist traffic brings wealth and opportunities for employment and empowerment to local communities, it also puts the environment and indigenous populations at risk, which begs the question — are increased pollution and habitat disruption a fair price to pay for ‘educating’ wealthy visitors about the natural world and its inhabitants? 
The ecotourism industry’s exploitation of local culture is also a big issue. Oftentimes, tourism companies and corporations profit the most, using locals for cheap labor and their cultural traditions for entertainment value. There is a fine line between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation, and as more travelers reach far-off destinations, Westernization can cause changes in cultural traditions and everyday life. While maintaining truly authentic cultural awareness is no easy process, the preservation and celebration of local cultures, traditions and history should be an integral part of the ecotourism experience. 
Governmental designation of land as nature reserves and conservation areas has also caused indigenous displacement. This was the case with the land of the Maasai tribe in Africa. Claimed by the government for private ownership, protected natural space, hotel construction and resource excavation, the Maasai were not adequately compensated for the lost land or benefitting from employment opportunities, which were instead being offered to ranchers, developers and educated professionals.
As the struggle between the Maasai and East African governmental institutions shows, there are often significant external costs that aren’t necessarily factored into the price of the environmental experience. This is true of the ecotourism industry in general; money buys experiences but fails to account for the far-reaching consequences of increased foot traffic to far-to-reach destinations. 
For example, Mount Everest has become more accessible than ever before, and Sherpa guides are in high demand. However, the tallest place on earth has been polluted by decades of climbers’ trash, and evidence has shown accumulation of microplastics at the very top of the mountain, as well as accumulation of discarded equipment and even human waste left by climbers. At Base Camp, those who are altitude-training use melted snow as drinking water, which has the potential to be contaminated with germs if people aren’t properly disposing of their waste on the mountain. 
Much of Everest’s problems stem from increased permits for the climbing season issued by the Nepalese government. More climbers means more money for the country and more employment opportunities for Sherpas. On the contrary, more climbers also means more inexperienced adventurers who are underprepared for the exertion of the climb, putting the lives of themselves and the Sherpas at risk.
While destinations around the globe are being celebrated for their unique geographic features and cultures, the growing ecotourism industry is currently at a crucial crossroads. It’s imperative that stricter government regulations are enacted at existing eco-resorts, camps and retreats. Greater effort should be made to limit visitors, so as to not strain local resources and preserve local traditions and ways of life, while still bringing in a sustainable amount of proceeds from tourism. The more limited spots there are, the higher the demand will be to visit exotic locales, bringing more revenue in for locals and indigenous groups. 
There is also a need for clearer requirements of what makes a place a true ‘sustainable’ destination. As I’ve discussed in previous columns, “eco-friendly” and “sustainable” are often used as buzzwords to attract customers and clientele. There are many frameworks and certifications available for aspiring eco-destinations, but there is not one overarching set of guidelines for what makes a company or hotel truly environmentally sustainable. Instead, ambitious green travelers must do the research on their own and investigate the sustainability practices of potential destinations.
In the case of previously undeveloped land, countries need to enact more stringent restrictions for buyers. It’s unrealistic to expect to preserve every single island, mountain and beach in its natural state forever, but unregulated construction, even in the name of sustainable development, needs to be managed and minimized. The value of these destinations is not purely monetary; they are vital in indigenous livelihoods, cultures and religions and should be preserved for the use and appreciation of future generations. 
Ecotourism as an industry has the potential to be both informative and fun, educational and enjoyable. It’s imperative that environmental tourist destinations enact stricter measures now to ensure long-term sustainability of their natural attractions, cultures and ways of life. While there is no shortage of incredible places to visit around the globe (post-pandemic, obviously!), it’s important to be a conscientious traveler and visit places that not only prioritize the conservation and protection of their environmental attributes but also the sociocultural and economic well-being of permanent residents.

One could never overstate the impact Black people have had on film. Black cinema spans decades and continents, so it’s safe to say there’s no better way to kick off Black History Month than with a curated list of Black-led films showcasing the diversity and breadth of these narratives. From Ousmane Sembène’s socio-political commentary on West Africa to Spike Lee’s endearing depiction of Brooklyn, cinema has been a premier medium for Black characters as they overcome life’s day-to-day obstacles while grappling with issues of belonging, family, love and power.
“Paris is Burning” (1990)
Jennie Livingston’s work is carried by Brooke Xtravaganza, Willi Ninja, Dorian Corey and Paris Duprée, to name a few icons. This documentary provides a look into the ball-room scene, a stunning subculture that provided a haven for Black/Latino queer youth during the AIDS epidemic and in the midst of still pervasive transphobia, homophobia and economic discrimination. However, this important work couldn’t be included without addressing the controversy surrounding it. Even though this cast launched Livingston’s career, she notoriously documented this community without compensating them. Match her energy and watch this film for free on YouTube! 
“Do The Right Thing” (1989)
 “The story of life is this: static. One hand is always fighting the other hand, and the left hand is kicking much a**,” says Spike Lee’s tragic figure, Radio Raheem. Who knew complex discussions on gentrification, police brutality, immigration and intra-racial relations could all seamlessly take place on a singular Brooklyn block? Spike Lee, of course (No really; he refuses to let us forget!). Lee’s hilarious characters, beautiful dialogue and cinematography – namely dutch angles and a necessary breaking of the fourth wall – give us the perfect channel into Black Brooklyn on the hottest day in New York. While the film may have charming dialogue, fun visuals and a sick soundtrack, it’s largely defined by its brutal climax that forces us to realize a truth that harkens back to the days of MLK and Malcolm X: Sometimes “the right thing” requires violent means.
“Juice” (1992)
What would you do for respect and power? In Ernest R. Dickerson’s “Juice,” we find another Black New York cast struggling to “do the right thing.” Follow four Harlem teens’ who, after being rendered powerless at the hands of police and violence, turn to crime, triggering an ethical conundrum and … a horror film? In this classic drama, Omar Epps goes head to head with Tupac Shakur, who delivers a flawless but scarily unhinged acting debut. 
“Jackie Brown” (1997)
If you can get past the image of Quentin Tarantino gleefully writing the n-word 38 times in this script, you’ll find the tale of a clever woman escaping financial exploitation through the only way cinema knows how: heist-level genius and a bit of romance. Pam Grier plays a flight attendant, Jackie Brown. Powerhouses Samuel L. Jackson and Robert De Niro also figure heavily into the film. Jackie is less than perfect – she’s out for herself, but still provides a refreshing deviation from the (loved but tired) Blaxploitation roles that characterized much of Grier’s career. 
“Tangerine” (2015)
Kitana Rodriguez and Mya Taylor’s magnetic on-screen chemistry save this Sean Baker film from being an hours long Apple advertisement. Following a day-in-the-life of Sin-Dee Rella and Alexandra, two sex-workers on a journey through Los Angeles to confront an infidelous man, this film is hilarious and beautifully shot from start-to-end. A heart-tugging depiction of sisterhood, Baker’s film literally made Black/transgender history with Rodriguez and Taylor’s Oscar campaigns. 
“She’s Gotta Have It” (1986)
Another Spike Lee Joint takes the cake, except this one takes the heat inside the bedroom. Tracy Camilla Johns plays the sexually liberated Nola Darling who juggles three men – all who want her to themselves. Lee’s jazz score, Ernest Dickerson’s beautiful shots of Brooklyn, and powerful monologue all make this film an unforgettable debut. While Lee falters in his handling of his protagonists’ sexual assualt, his representation of a Black woman approaching sex and love on her own terms – and the men willing to live by them – provided a much-needed well-rounded depiction of Black love and life.
“Ceddo” (1977)
“There can be no development in Africa if women are left out of the account.” Ousmane Sembène’s Princess Dior Yacine, played by Tabata Ndiaye, provides one of the most important depictions of the African woman. Grappling with the cultural erasure brought on by missionaries and the threat of enslavers, Yacine’s silent but confident strength holds this film together amidst the chaos that ensues at the hands of power-hungry men. With beautiful costume and set design that reinforces a microcosmic depiction of a Wolof society struggling to free itself from the oppressive influence of Islam and Christianity, Sembène provides a strong argument for Africans to reasses their relationships with Abrahamic religions.
“Sounder” (1972)
“We’ll do it, because we have to do it,” exclaims Cicely Tyson’s Rebecca Morgan … and she’s right. Tyson’s passing reminds us to honor her iconic seven-decades long career. Tyson’s breakthrough performance as “Sounder’s” Rebecca Morgan provides a simple, realistic, but psychologically moving depiction of a woman’s determination to keep her Lousianna family afloat during the Great Depression. This Oscar-nominated film manages to explore rural southern life, dignity and resistance through one family’s efforts to overcome a system that was designed to trap them.
“Little Monsters” (2019)
When Toni Morrison wrote, “There is no bad luck in this world but whitefolks,” she forgot about zombies! I know we’re tired of seeing Black women save everyone on screen, but this apocalyptic comedy puts an irresistible spin on the convention. Playing a zombie-killing kindergarten teacher, Lupita Nyong’o stars in this feel-good tale that reminds us nothing is more beautiful than childhood bliss.
“Pariah” (2011)
“I am not running; I am choosing … I am not broken; I am free.” director Dee Rees translates her lived experience flawlessly on-screen. Adepero Oduye’s portrayal of a young queer Black girl tip-toeing between the woman her parents want her to be and the version of herself she knows to be true. As she enters her coming-of-age with the constant pressure of exacerbating an already fraught family situation, Pariah is a story of a girl who comes to learn she has no choice but to come to terms with herself.
