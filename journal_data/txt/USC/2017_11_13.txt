Hundreds of people attended a ceremony last week celebrating the 80th anniversary of former First Lady Patricia Nixon’s graduation from USC. 
Nixon, who was married to President Richard Nixon, graduated cum laude from USC in 1937, according to the National First Ladies’ Library. The ceremony took place in Town and Gown, and the Nixon Foundation reported that 500 people were in attendance. 
Nixon’s granddaughter, Melanie Eisenhower, joined USC President C. L. Max Nikias to recognize the former first lady’s graduation anniversary. Eisenhower, the great-granddaughter of former President Dwight Eisenhower, was also elected to join the Nixon Foundation board of directors. 
The University awarded three students with the Pat Nixon Scholarship earlier this year. Two of those scholars, Bernadette Lucas and John Bacolores, joined Nikias and Eisenhower to open the ceremony. 
The ceremony also announced the opening of a new exhibit, holding over 40 iconic photos from the former first lady’s trips to more than 75 countries, original buttons from the “Pat for First Lady” campaign and a newly furbished portrait of Patricia Nixon commissioned by former ambassador and USC donor Walter Annenberg in 2000. 
The exhibit also features Patricia Nixon’s 1937 USC diploma, with her graduation announcement and her 1961 honorary doctorate from the University. The exhibit will remain open into 2018. 
Patricia Nixon was admitted to USC in 1934 on a research scholarship that covered her $240 tuition and living expenses. 
While at USC, she researched for a psychology professor’s writing project and helped grade student papers. She worked multiple jobs as a cafeteria waitress, librarian, survey writer, beauty products tester, movie extra and in the University vice president’s office. Her average workweek was 40 hours, excluding her classes. 
Patricia Nixon graduated in 1937 with a degree in merchandising, with a certificate to teach at the high school level. The degree was the equivalent of a master’s degree, making her the first first lady to hold a degree of this level. 
According to the Nixon Foundation, former first ladies Rosalynn Carter, Barbara Bush and Laura Bush sent videos that were played at the ceremony. First Lady Melania Trump sent a message which Nixon Foundation President Bill Baribault read at the ceremony. 
“Mrs. Nixon is a model First Lady who acted with courage and determination to advance the lives of the underprivileged, the sick and the forgotten,” Trump wrote in the letter. “Mrs. Nixon is a true role model for us all. I join in honoring her legacy of service and love for humanity, which is worthy of our admiration and remembrance.”

For the fourth year in a row, USC student-athletes achieved an all-time high graduation rate, according to NCAA data released last Wednesday. USC student-athletes who started school between 2007 and 2010 recorded an 86 percent six-year graduation success rate, 3 percentage points higher than in 2016. It also marks an 18-point increase over the past 10 years for USC.
“We are delighted that our student-athletes continue to perform well in the classroom,” senior associate athletic director Magdi El Shahawy said to USC News.
Out of 18 sports programs tracked by the NCAA, five recorded perfect graduation rates: women’s soccer, men’s and women’s tennis, men’s golf and women’s rowing. Four other sports had rates over 90 percent: Women’s water polo and women’s swimming both had a 96 percent rate, women’s basketball had a 92 percent rate and men’s volleyball had a 91 percent rate.
USC’s football program had an all-time high graduation rate of 73 percent, and 12 USC teams either raised their graduation success rate or stayed at the same rate. Men’s golf and men’s tennis increased the most, both by 20 percentage points. Men’s and women’s track both increased 13 percent, while women’s tennis also recorded double-digit improvement, with a 12 percent rise.
“There is a culture of academic success in our athletic department,” El Shahawy said, according to USC News. “And it is evident when data like this comes out.”

Tommy Trojan has been taped up and lamppost banners across campus read, “Beat the Bruins.” It’s rivalry week.
The last football game of the regular season sparks intense school spirit, as UCLA is the team’s final opponent. This big game includes many different traditions held by various campus organizations to rile students up for the rivalry match on Saturday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
Troy Week
Each year, USC Campus Activities, Late Night ’SC, USC Concerts Committee and the Undergraduate Student Government organize Troy Week, the week leading up to the game. This week-long event includes various dress-up days that are reminiscent of high school spirit weeks. Monday was “Pajama Day” and marked the first day of Troy Week, an excuse to roll out of bed and go straight to class. On Tuesday, students can show their spirit by dressing identically to one another in “Twin Day.” 
Wednesday’s dress-up day is “Way Back Wednesday,” in which students wear vintage clothing reminiscent of previous time periods. On Thursday, students can show their support for the football team by dressing up in their spirit gear. Those who dress up for all four days will be given the chance to spin a wheel for Conquest merchandise such as shirts, hats or fanny packs.

Trojan Knights
A longstanding campus organization, the Trojan Knights has its own traditions for the big game. Every year, the brotherhood protects USC’s George Tirebiter statue with Tirebiter House, a kennel built by the Facilities Management Services, and sings the UCLA counter-fight song, a parody of UCLA’s fight song.
However, the group’s tradition that has lasted since the 1940s is Tommy Watch. As far back as 1942, a few Bruins were spotted vandalizing Tommy Trojan the week before the rivalry game. This was after the Knights stole the Victory Bell from UCLA the year prior. As a result, the Knights decided to tape up USC’s famed statue, a practice now carried out by the Facilities Management Services, to prevent the Bruins from ruining the statue again.
After the penultimate game ends, the Knights camp out at Tommy Trojan. Over the years, USC has still made advancements in security by closing the campus at night and developing Tommy Cam, a security camera which watches over the center of the University Park campus.
“The security measures in place now are easily circumvented and have not kept away Bruins,” said Knights president David Monk, a senior majoring in law, history and culture. “Each year I’ve been in school, at least one attempt has been made to paint Tommy.”
The Trojan Knights typically employs two of its members to take two-hour shifts at the statue; however, there could be up to 20 members at one time performing Tommy Watch. The members at Tommy Trojan would notify the rest of the brotherhood if an issue were to arise. Because the organization has about 100 members, members are still able to get a good amount of sleep while devoting their time to this task. Those camping out can study or participate in activities like the Knights’ annual wiffleball game. 
“Nothing about Tommy Watch is obligatory for any of our members,” said Knights rush chair David Gregg, a junior majoring in chemical engineering. “We do it exclusively because we love to do it, and out of love for USC and this rivalry.”

Hecuba Watch
With USC Village opening this year, the USC Helenes will also take part in this tradition by launching Hecuba Watch. Much like Tommy Watch, at least two Helenes members will camp out at USC Village’s Hecuba statue overnight to ensure no one vandalizes it. Instead of tape, the statue is protected by a large red crate decorated by the sisterhood. On one side, the Helenes set up an interactive wall where students or people in the community can write about who or what inspires them. The group will also use this opportunity to promote its hygiene drive for students to donate items like blankets, clothes, toothbrushes or toothpaste.
Much like the Knights’ layout for Tommy Watch, the Helenes’ plan to hold organized activities for those at the campout including a game night and alumni sleepover. First Lady Niki Nikias will also continue her annual tradition of giving baklava, a Greek dessert, to the Knights and Helenes as a sign of appreciation for their service to USC and willingness to camp out at Tommy and Hecuba all week.  
“Hecuba Watch is in partnership with the University, not really the Trojan Knights, but we will be supporting each other and visiting each other at Tommy and Hecuba throughout the week,” said Helenes director of public relations Mahima Dutt, a junior majoring in communication.
Conquest
Apart from Tommy and Hecuba watches, both the Helenes and Knights will be present with the Victory Bell for Conquest on Thursday.
Organized by USG, Trojan Pride, Campus Activities and Concerts Committee, Conquest happens annually the Thursday before the UCLA game and begins at 5 p.m. on McCarthy Quad. Food trucks, vendors, a Ferris wheel, bonfire and mini golf course will be open to the public at this time. The centerpiece of the night is a concert, but the artists have yet been announced. 
Apart from the Trojan Knights, the other organizations that will be present at the big event are the Song Girls, football team, Trojan Marching Band, spirit leaders and other athletic teams. The Song Girls will do a performance on stage with the marching band while the organizations will talk with the crowd. This year’s vintage theme for Conquest inspired the Concerts Committee to bring back Troy Week. Both events, along with old and new traditions from the Knights and Helenes, seek to bring about a strong sense of school spirit and prepare students for the game against “the other school.”

“All-day breakfast” is a phrase that excites even the most stressed out student or office employee. With a successful parent restaurant in Westwood, Fundamental DTLA brings all-day breakfast and all-day lunch into the hustle and bustle of Downtown. Located on 8th Street and Grand Avenue in the heart of downtown Los Angeles, the restaurant offers moderately priced menu options to the average commuter working their way through the city. As the brunch movement continues to take the city by storm, Fundamental has successfully eased its way into this highly aesthetic and picturesque scene. 
A warm hostess stands outside Fundamental to greet and seat guests going in and out of the restaurant. The 40-seat spacious interior allows guests to enjoy their meals in an intimate booth or along the marble-laced bar if they choose to dine in. For those short on time, they can order their meals at the pick-up station located further inside the shop. 
The earthy tones and chic interior design of  Fundamental brings an energizing element to the highly industrialized culture of Downtown. Large windows decorate the entire front wall, offering customers a nice view of the bustling sea of vehicles and pedestrians. Upon entry, guests are welcomed by walls bearing rows of live plants. An open kitchen allows guests to peek into the flavorful creations of Fundamental’s skilled chefs. 
Menus are streamlined on a single sheet of white cardstock and include a limited number of choices. This is an advantage for Fundamental because it provides the busy office workers of Downtown a more concise list of items to choose from. While customers are given a great variety of beverages to choose from, the prices of these items can vary slightly. Most Coke products on the menu are around $2.50, while a cup of coffee costs up to $6.

The all-day breakfast portion of the menu is one of the restaurant’s biggest draws. Mornings at Fundamental consists of kouign-amann, coffee, scones and buttery croissants capable of starting anyone’s day on a happy note. The avocado toast, grain and seed bowl, house-made granola and bacon-egg sandwich provide more hefty breakfast options. The chicken sausage breakfast burrito is a fan favorite, boasting creative ingredients such as tater tots and guacamole. 
Office workers coming for the lunch rush have their pick of six eclectic made-to-order sandwiches or the choice of two salads. Although these options are short, the fully packed flavors of each make up for it in taste. One of the more popular choices is the Latin-inspired chicken torta. This dish is composed of roasted tomato salsa, guacamole, crema, pickled jalapeño and queso fresco. The tomato salsa complements the perfectly seasoned chicken breast, with the guacamole and crema adding a smooth finish. The pickled jalapeño cuts nicely through the queso fresco, creating a balancing effect on the palate. Although the flavors were exemplary, the bottom half of the sandwich came out a little soggy and created a mess during the meal. 
Sides are available to add along to any of these lunch items, ranging from dirty potato salad to roasted garlic and chermoula orzo. Because all sides are $5, those looking for a more simple pairing can order the salt and pepper kettle chips for $2.50. 
The prices of most dishes range from $10 to $13. For students, Fundamental DTLA is a perfect spot for a laid-back brunch or an intimate lunch with close friends. If students want to get away from the mainstream fast food shops lining Figueroa Street, this is an elegant alternative street. Unlike its parent restaurant in West Los Angeles, Fundamental closes its doors at an early 7 p.m. 
As a newcomer in the Downtown culinary scene, Fundamental will need to either extend its hours or include a separate dinner menu if it wants to cater to the many diners who enjoy the city well into midnight. Once it takes these steps to become more available, there is nothing stopping Fundamental from thriving in a city that rarely sleeps.

I hate remaining idle or moving at a lackadaisical pace. I prefer to keep going until I’ve reached my limits. My need to push forward was more evident than ever this past weekend, as I vacationed in New York City. On Monday morning, I was still in New York. By the afternoon, I was back in Los Angeles.
A few weeks ago I wrote about my upcoming trip to New York, which I booked impulsively and somewhat irresponsibly. Considering I have a full-time job and am also back in school, my time would be better spent in the office or doing homework, rather than frolicking the streets of the Big Apple. But at the time, I felt a strong urge to get away from L.A., even if just for a weekend. It goes back to my feelings of dissatisfaction with whatever I’m doing in the current moment. Regardless of how successful I am or have become, or how satisfying the work I do is — I’m always yearning for the next best thing.
I arrived in New York City late Thursday evening, just after midnight. Upon arrival, I was immediately reminded of Los Angeles’ downsides. Even the most arbitrary triggers had me feeling sour toward L.A., such as hailing a cab at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Public transportation seems so much more efficient and advanced in New York, I thought, and it immediately had me fuming about my life back home. In addition, there was a multimedia advertisement for the Metropolitan Opera that played on a small screen inside the taxi. Such feats are only a pipe dream here in Los Angeles. The classical music scene feels so much more immersive in New York City. True, Los Angeles has a small corps that is devoted to classical music, but that typically only resides in one part of town. But stepping foot on New York soil, I swear I could already hear music in the air.
Art by Effren Villanueva | Daily Trojan
The following day, I felt like the music was following me. As I welcomed the frigid weather, which most would find bothersome, the sounds of strings and woodwinds played furiously wherever I went. It never gets below 50 degrees in Los Angeles. I have peacoats and sherpa jackets that gather dust in my closets. Yet I’m finally able to dust them off across the country. Why was Los Angeles so vapid, I kept thinking, and why did Angelenos waste their energy on the lowbrow? The winds may have been cold, yet my body felt warm with contentment.
But by that evening I couldn’t feel my face. My ears were bright red and my motor skills delayed from the cold. I kept repeating to myself, “This is still better than L.A. This is still better than L.A.,” because it was something different. I repeated this mantra to myself as I walked 20 blocks from the stalled subway train to Lincoln Center. I attended the U.S. premiere of Thomas Adès’ The Exterminating Angel, which was, without a doubt, the most important production I’ve been to in the last two years. I left the performance on a cloud, only to be brought back down to earth as I waited over 30 minutes for a train back to Brooklyn, where I was staying.
As time wore on, I could feel my attitude changing slightly. By the end of Day 2, I felt my optimism beginning to disintegrate. I was shivering. My feet were tired. And it was so cold that (unbeknownst to me at the time) I ended up wearing the same turtleneck/flannel combination my entire trip. And by Day 3, I felt kind of like the city itself: dirty, tired and played.
Normally, I would relish in all the inconveniences the city throws at me. But things were starting to feel somewhat different. Usually, when I return from vacation, I tend to fester bitterly the entire ride home. But I felt myself actually looking forward to coming back to Los Angeles. I was only gone for a weekend, sure, but it was just long enough for me to realize how much I take the city for granted. For one, you don’t need to bring a damn coat wherever you go. Yesterday morning, when I went straight from the airport to work, I kept my winter coat on, only to realize I was sweating profusely. I legitimately forgot I didn’t need one. As I arrived to work, I keenly left it in my car as I walked to the office. I smiled knowing it would be going back in storage for the remainder of the year.
But perhaps my warmest welcome back to Los Angeles was seeing a guy driving out of the downtown Whole Foods parking lot with a joint in his mouth. The carefree attitude of L.A.’s stoners was a cordial reminder for me to slow down and enjoy the moment. L.A. is everything New York isn’t, and vice versa. I’ll always hold New York City close to my heart, but as I get older, maybe Los Angeles is where I’m meant to settle down.

I began watching Entourage a few months ago, toward the end of the summer. I finished the entirety of the HBO half-hour comedy show — all eight seasons of it — unreasonably fast, although the reason why is difficult to explain. Entourage was neither particularly good, nor deep. It was, however, interestingly enough, critically acclaimed, gathering a few wins and several nominations through its seven-year run: perhaps indicating the trend of Hollywood enjoying content about itself.
But the series was insightful. And for someone aspiring to enter the entertainment industry, Entourage is on the word-of-mouth must-watch list. Its name is uttered everywhere, and the series is oddly educational: There’s no better medium to learn who an agent is, how managers and publicists and business managers operate in the grand scheme of an artist’s career. The artist, in this case, is young movie star Vincent Chase (played by Adrian Grenier), and the series follows him and his group of friends as they traverse Hollywood and enjoy the perks of Vincent’s career in the spotlight.
I finished the show a couple of months before the revelations of sexual harassment, assault and misconduct began to wrack Hollywood and displace the powerful men within it. But it is difficult now not to think back to Entourage, and to compare it to what I know now about the industry.
There is not a single female character on this show who has substance or grit or a compelling arc. What every woman on the show does have, on the other hand, is a sexualization to almost the point of ludicrousness: They are all aspiring actresses, models or executives actively willing to seduce and sleep with famous men to get what they want. But this is portrayed in a way that’s unflattering, generic and ultimately dehumanizing: The wife of one of the show’s leads, Ari Gold (played by Jeremy Piven), isn’t even named until the end of the series.
Entourage is intensely filtered through the male gaze, but as such, it provides riveting insight into the way Hollywood looks at women and the way Hollywood likes to look at itself. Perhaps one defense of the show is that it is satire — though that is a genre it cannot really qualify for, never having that second layer of social commentary. HBO is home to innumerable original, complicated, female-driven shows that break ground and push the medium and the industry forward. However, people don’t watch Entourage for the women. They watch it for the men and the very male shenanigans that ensue.
No one, even and especially those who work in the industry, could look at Entourage and mistake it for real life (though Piven was actually recently accused of sexual assault). But for a series that purportedly shows a fantasy of what the movies and their makers live like, it is important to realize that a fantasy for some is not a fantasy for all. Where power dynamics are concerned, the women in the world of Entourage certainly have it worse. They exist only as sexual objects — and so the tools they are given by the show’s writers to wield power, in the rare cases that the women on Entourage are powerful, tend to be sexual in nature. For example, Vincent at one point obtains an agent to replace Ari: Her name is Amanda, but he winds up dumping her because she sleeps with him. In another case, a rising star at Ari’s agency is fired because she sleeps with his old (male) friend — whom Ari is so hesitant to punish, for committing the same transgression.
It is a tendency for television and films that depict Hollywood as a setting to feature women in more vulnerable roles: the ingenues, the bottom-rung players who have to vault themselves upward whichever way possible. Or, when they are not at the bottom, they are sneaky sirens whose only goal is to manipulate men. 
But it is paramount, amid today’s climate, for television and film to demonstrate that it is possible for a woman to gain success and wield her own authority, to one day open doors for other women and to do so while being empowered and empowering herself. It is important for the world to understand that each woman, no matter her rung on the corporate ladder, possesses her own power. But in order for that to happen, the media must recognize it too, by portraying strong female characters who open that possibility to everyone else, in audience’s minds.
Zoe Cheng is a junior majoring in writing for screen and television. Her column, “Cross Section,” runs Tuesdays.
“Entourage” is an adaptation from the all-female “Sex and the City.” Even the characters are directly converted from the Sex and the City and much of the script is identical. I don’t see any feminists whining about how “Sex and the City” objectified and stereotyped men.
“people don’t watch Entourage for the women. They watch it for the men and the very male shenanigans that ensue.”
SHAME on those viewers!

Celebrated yearly on Nov. 11, Veterans Day landed and passed on a Saturday this past weekend, ostensibly forgotten by the greater USC community. Like many other colleges across the United States, USC did not observe this holiday, giving students, faculty and staff neither Friday nor Monday off. While USC heartily supports its veteran students, faculty and alumni with numerous academic and career programs, to cement its support, USC should observe Veterans Day in future academic calendars to remind its population of the courageous efforts of those on campus who have served. A day away from the humdrum of campus life would allow its civilian community to thank veterans freely. 
Originally instituted to celebrate a rather transient moment of world peace after World War I, the holiday now commemorates all honorable members of the U.S. military. Federal offices close on Veterans Day and observe the holiday on a Monday or Friday when it falls on a weekend. This year, offices closed on Friday. States and local governments and institutions, however, independently decide whether to observe the holiday. Notably, while many businesses remained opened, schools in the the Los Angeles Unified School District and Cal State Northridge observed the preceding Friday. 
Generally, education holds a long-standing legislative history with the military. Introduced in 1944, the GI Bill offers all honorably discharged military members monetary funds to further their education at all levels. Many colleges actively recruit veterans to apply and take advantage of these benefits. USC honors GI Bill benefits and additionally matches any extra costs limited by the legislation. USC has given Americans who have served an additional $2.3 million in financial assistance, awards and  numerous scholarships to ROTC students. 
In fact, USC touts these strong and continued connections and support for the U.S. Military. USC served as a training school in both World Wars and introduced an ROTC program in 1943. Today, USC enrolls 894 veteran undergraduate and graduate students and 174 ROTC cadets. In addition, USC offers a degree that is especially tailored to Americans with records of military service. 
The Marshall School of Business has a Master of Business Administration that is solely offered to those who have served, and the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work offers a new concentration for veteran social work. The University’s Veterans Resource Center, established in 2014, even caters directly to the population of servicemembers, helping them transition smoothly back into civilian life. This past week, the Veterans Resource Center held Military Appreciation Week. Veterans attended an honorary luncheon, networking discussion and even free classes through USC Recreational Sports. 
Nevertheless, while the center deemed Military Appreciation Week a success, no events were heavily publicized or even made available for the greater community to recognize the service of former members of the military. Since the committee that schedules academic calendars does so three years in advance, USC realistically would not be able to observe Veterans Day until the 2020-21 academic year. Smaller events, however, could be hosted in the meantime. Letter-writing campaigns or other community appreciation events could be held to recognize veterans inside and outside of USC.  
Even though some may argue that students may use the day selfishly to extend their carousing weekends, the University will never be able to control how students spend their day off. Moreover, one could even say the same about the Mondays that USC does observe for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day and Presidents Day during spring semester. As the community already has been awarded the freedom to honor Martin Luther King and George Washington, observing Veterans Day would allow students, faculty and staff to recognize veterans in addition. USC should take time to honor the timeless bravery of those who have served. 
And as always, in observing any holiday, it’s the thought that counts. Merely providing the community with the option to spend Veterans Day away from the collegiate bubble brings attention to the cause. A day off would at least remind the busy community of the bravery and victory of the American forces. As USC extensively supports its veteran community, USC should also observe Veterans Day to allow its greater community to commemorate military valor in whichever way each individual chooses to do so.

The USC campus has many great food selections. For $10 you can spend your entire lunch filling your stomach with The Good Karma Cafe’s unlimited servings of vegetarian dishes. If you’re in need of some wholesome fast food, then of course there’s the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. However, Los Angeles is one of the most diverse cities in the country, offering a wide selection of restaurants just five minutes away from campus. That is why it is highly recommended to take the bus or walk off campus for lunch. Doing so can be a highly enjoyable experience. 
Himalayan House
The Himalayan House serves Indian cuisine to all who visit the restaurant located on West Jefferson Boulevard. Its menu is filled with traditional Indian cuisines such as thali, a combination platter served with rice, a choice of meat, vegetables and even some lentil soup. Being that rice is an Indian staple, it is used creatively in many recipes. One such recipe is biryani, which is rice seasoned in sauce and served with a mixture of meats and vegetables. The Himalayan House serves egg biryani, vegetable biryani and chicken biryani. With a five-star rating on Yelp, it is the perfect place to visit for Indian cuisine. 
Azla Vegan
Most people find themselves avoiding sleep because there is just so much to do at USC. That is why coffee can become just as important as water. Not only does Azla Vegan serve Ethiopian dishes, but it is also known for its Ethiopian coffee (served both hot and cold). Coffee lovers can enjoy a lunch at Azla Vegan’s and then have coffee for dessert. While Ethiopian dishes can often be described as spicy meats and vegetables served atop sourdough bread, Azla focuses on creating a truly vegan experience. Its menu offers selections such as yellow curry potatoes, spicy lentils and spicy-sweet potatoes. Azla Vegan’s is another restaurant with a five-star rating on Yelp. It is located on South Grand Avenue. 
Soy Roll & Katsu
Soy Roll & Katsu serves inexpensive Asian-inspired cuisine very close to campus, making it very possible to walk there, buy a meal for under $10, and be back studying in the library all within a 40-minute time lapse. While ramen can be as cheap as $6 per bowl, there is also the sushi special which allows you to buy three rolls for $19.99. 
Bird’s Nest Cafe
Sip on an espresso in a vibrant environment surrounded by beautiful murals. The Bird’s Nest Cafe serves American cuisine with a creative flair in the historic University Park. The breakfast menu includes omelets, pancakes and yogurt parfaits. The lunch menu also offers a nice selection of sandwiches and salads that can be paired with a lemonade served in a mason jar. Although it aims to provide a luxury culinary experience, the Bird’s Nest Cafe is actually a great place for a family visit, girl’s brunch or even a casual date. Depending on the time of day, it can be reached within five minutes by car. It is a little far for those who do not like to walk or bike; therefore, try taking the bus or using Lyft. 
Chichen Itza
Chichen Itza’s goal is to make us feel like we are eating at a friend’s home in Yucatan while reminding us of the entire country of Mexico’s flavorful cuisine. It is very easy to forget that there is so much more to Mexican food than burritos and tacos. Chichen Itza’s focus on capturing the true essence of Mexican cookery reminds the USC community that Mexican cuisine also involves ceviche, asada and tamales. Not to mention, there is also dessert. Have fried plantains with cream or toasted bread cooked in cinnamon-raisin syrup. All these dishes and more can be ordered when you visit Chichen Itza.

I might be six months late in writing this, but the year isn’t over yet and Gucci is still a hit. I’m just going to say it: Gucci’s pre-fall campaign changed my life. Ever since its release in April, neither my fashion sense nor my wallet have ever been the same.
You’ve probably heard about this little brand named Gucci, and you’ve probably seen at least one Gucci item on Instagram this year. The pre-fall campaign made early headlines when it was first revealed that they held a casting call for only people of color. The campaign made further headlines when it was confirmed that it had only hired people of color for its campaign. The hiring decision is especially profound in a time when inclusivity is still a major problem for most fashion brands. Admittedly, it was this public statement of inclusivity from the Gucci campaign that lured me in. However, it was the authenticity of the culture depicted within the campaign that forced me to stay. It didn’t feel artificial. I felt like the campaign was asking me and people like me to actually buy their clothes.
Alessandro Michele, who is the creative director of Gucci, was inspired to create this campaign because of three things. The first inspiration was an exhibit which was showcased at the Photographer’s Gallery in London last summer titled “Made You Look.” The exhibit focused on black masculinity and dandyism (dandyism is a play off of the term “dandy” from 18th and 19th century Britain). Black dandyism in particular, refers to countering the expectations of how black men should look and dress. The second inspiration was Malick Sidibé, a famous photographer whose work focused on his experience of growing up in Bamako, Mali. The third and perhaps most referenced inspiration was the ’60s underground music movement in England called Northern Soul which was inspired by African-American soul music. The campaign itself explores the freedom of expression found within dance and music. It was accompanied by a short film staged within the Mildmay Club in London and photographed by Glen Luchford. 
The film, needless to say, was stunning. This was demonstrated on multiple fronts, from the way the lights reflected off the clothes to the interplay between choreography and rhythm during excerpts  of The Night by Franki Valli and The Four Seasons. The Gucci clothing perfectly fit every occasion and each of the models brought life to their outfits with the way they walked and danced.  This was the first time I looked at a fashion campaign and wished I was in it. This was the first time I looked at fashion as something I wanted to be a part of, something I wanted to more than just wear. I wanted to experience it through dance and song, expressing my sense of freedom all the while. 
The first time I saw this campaign, I was amazed. I had seen its style in old photos of my mother and grandfather. Old family videos had exposed me to the dance moves. The campaign was so well-executed, authentic, stunning and aesthetically pleasing. Gucci mastered the art of unapologetic blackness, and I am obsessed. The symbolism of the snakes and the butterflies, the mismatched prints and the white sneakers are alls statement pieces in what was a turning point in this year’s fashion. The campaign was an outright success.
Fashion is for everyone, but the constant exclusion of certain people within the industry and artistic medium has made it a hard thing to love. After this campaign, I truly I felt could walk into a Gucci store and not feel patronized or unwelcome. I often say in my head, “Did you see the campaign? I’m supposed to be here.”  I guess this just speaks volumes about the importance of representation. Appreciation should be weighed over exploitation and appropriation. In the years to come, one can only hope the fashion industry realizes that inclusion does not damper artistic excellence or sales. If anything, the evidence points in the opposite direction.

Everybody on campus knows there is no other sport that USC prides itself in more than football. Come Saturday, a sea of Cardinal and Gold will storm the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. It’s truly a feast for the eyes — eyes that have endured several weeks’ worth of studies, scheduling conflicts and the like. But just as our eyes require something to lighten up the mood, so do our ears. Here are some songs to get you and your friends pumped for the upcoming season. Whether it’s at the tailgate or within the stadium, we need to get ready to fight on. 
Kendrick Lamar – HUMBLE.
It’s never a party without Kendrick. The upbeat tune coupled with a message about standing up to your rivals is sure to get the crowd on their feet. 
Logic – Flexicution 
This one is sure to remind us of how the Trojans are killing the game. 
Moosh & Twist – Get It, Got It, Go
Not many people have heard of these guys, but they do put out solid hype tracks. See for yourself. 
Pusha T – Trouble On My Mind (feat. Tyler, The Creator) 
“Trouble On My Mind” is a song that just lets you know that our team is ready to wreak havoc on that field. 
Jump – Lupe Fiasco (feat. Gizzle) 
Once at the top of the charts, this bass-heavy number is perfect for getting the players and fans nodding their heads. Each successive bar will get your heart beating faster by the second. 
Beast – Chris Classic 
“Beast” is a short but sweet song about unleashing what you’ve got inside and being the best. 
0 to 100 / The Catch Up – Drake 
“0 to 100” doesn’t need an explanation. 
Dream – One Republic 
Although this one strays from the typical format of loud bass and explicit rapping, the acoustic touch is compelling nonetheless. Lesson number one: go big or go home. 
Backseat Freestyle – Kendrick Lamar 
Let’s throw more Kendrick in there, because why not? 
Money and the Power – Kid Ink 
“Money and the Power” may be an old tune, but its energetic punch line has never faded in the slightest. Grind to be at the very top and just laugh off any hurdle life throws at you. 
Burial – Yogi (feat. Pusha T) 
“I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled.” 
Jungle (Remix) – X Ambassadors (feat. Jamie N Commons and JAY Z) 
“Jungle” is a go-to song for people that just love to sweat, bleed, and cry for their passion. Nobody’s out there to save you or pray for you, so you better step up to the occasion. 
I Do This – Abstract (feat. Roze) 
This one’s for the guys out on the field. Never forget where you came from and why you play the sport you love so dearly. 
B.I.G. – X Ambassadors 
There’s not much lyrical substance to “B.I.G.,” but that’s fine. The moral of the song: every day is a new day, so let the whole world know who you are while you can. 
Calm Down – G-Eazy 
This tune’s got the tempo and bounce to supplement any pregame ritual. “Random” is also worth checking out. 
Bonfire – Childish Gambino 
Here, Gambino lifts our spirits by telling us to not care about all the trash talk and disrespect people dish out at you. We’re Trojans and we know we’re the best at what we do. 
6 Foot 7 Foot – Lil Wayne, Cory Gunz 
“6 Foot 7 Foot” is fast-paced and also filled to the brim with bass. The endless punch lines laid onto a simple beat makes this one of Lil Wayne’s best works. 
Classic Male Pregame – Lil Dicky 
It’s always good to hear Lil Dicky’s literal and smooth rapping about what the classic pregame should look like. 
All the Way Up (Remix) – Fat Joe (feat. Remy Ma, David Guetta, French Montana, InfaRed, and GLOWINTHEDARK) 
There’s no way you don’t know this song. The reimagined chorus adds a fresh perspective though. 
GDFR (K Theory Remix) – Flo Rida (feat. Sage The Gemini, The Lookas, and K Theory) 
It’s the song we all party to, except with bass. Much more bass. 
Vengeance On My Mind – G-Eazy (feat. Dana) 
Have you ever been beaten by someone before? Get back up, grind, and hit them harder than they could have ever imagined. 
Two Tone Rebel – E-Dubble 
“Two Tone Rebel” is a catchy track about raising a little hell and showboating. Fun fact: TwoToneRebel used to be E-Dubble’s Xbox Live gamertag. 
El Chapo – The Game (feat. Skrillex)
It’s not 2017 unless we throw a little Spanish in there…

Los Angeles is world famous for its great beach weather that lasts for a good half of each year. Sure, that’s great for beach lovers, but for college students with no air conditioning in their dorms, it could be an absolute nightmare. From being unable to fall asleep to having no motivation to go out, scorching heat affects USC students in all aspects of life.
However, there are ways to combat the heat without dropping half your living expenses on an air conditioner. To alleviate these torturous situations, here are some things students can do easily with a limited budget:
1. Invest in a fan
Fans may seem bulky and unnecessary for the few summer months, but investing in one will be absolutely worth it when others are struggling with 100-degree heat in the middle of November. Fans are a perfect solution to the lack of air conditioning and are relatively easy to sell when the time comes.
A quick tip to chill the room even faster is to set a tray of ice cubes right in front of the fan, then wait as released air cools  drastically!
2. If you live in a breezy area, keep the window open
A hot room is a significantly better option than a hot, stuffy room. Opening the window allows for air circulation that can not only keep a constant breeze, but can also eliminate the smell of dirty laundry and whatever smells float around in a college dorm.
3. Watermelons
Head on over to Trader Joe’s or Target and buy a watermelon, because these fruits not only contain healthy minerals but also double as a delicious and refreshing snack to combat the heat. Watermelons also contain lots of water, which is vital to prevent dehydration. Keep the watermelon in the fridge for a few hours before consumption for best cooling results.
4. Freeze healthy popsicles as snacks
Didn’t finish your acai bowl from Sunlife Organics? Got leftover orange juice in the fridge? This next tip allows you to put an interesting spin on leftovers! Simply buy a popsicle mold or ice cube trayand pour whatever fruit juices you have into it. These popsicles will satisfy students with a sweet tooth without carrying the guilt that comes along with regular cold desserts.
5. Take a cold shower
Nothing feels better than a nice, cold shower after walking outside in the blistering heat for a whole day. If the temperature in the dorm is distracting you from your studies, take a break and hop into the shower. This can help the mind relax and provides an excellent opportunity for a personal karaoke session. Even better, cold showers reduce electricity bill costs since hot showers require electricity to heat the water. Whoho doesn’t love saving money?
6. Hibernate in Leavey
If none of these tips work and the world still seems to be melting, head on over to Leavey Library. Live there. Study there. There is air conditioning, it’s available for 24 hours,and staying in there helps project a studious image of yourself to your friends and family. You’ll be able to meet a diverse range of students and even make new connections while competing for an empty study room.
