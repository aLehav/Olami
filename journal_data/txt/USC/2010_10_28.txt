The music we dance to once began with Throbbing Gristle’s infamous mash-ups of industrial clangs and images of penetration.
Now, the formerly obscure movement of the 1970s European arts scene has transformed into a genre of ascending synths, layered beats and Day-Glo-clad youth, all of which are set to festoon the Shrine Auditorium this weekend for the annual two-night Hard Haunted Mansion, already half sold-out and boasting its most diverse lineup to date.
Although the term “rave” is nothing new to Angelenos, the Hard concerts, organized by local DJ Gary Richards — aka Destructo — pride themselves on offering a more critically acclaimed roster of electric artists than Monster Massive or other large-scale events can boast.
With acts such as Soulwax, Green Velvet and Justice having played at previous Hard events, mind-altering drugs are clearly not necessary to ensure a great time.
This year’s festival brings a very special name to Los Angeles: the U.K. duo Underworld, one of the seminal artists of ’90s electronica, known for its rousing single “Born Slippy (Nuxx)” and unusually energetic, hypnotic live shows.
The duo’s appearance comes on the tail of its latest LP, Barking, a lush mind shaker made collaboratively with Dubfire, Paul Van Dyk and High Contrast.
“After 20 years of having your music remixed, you hear other perspectives and sometimes wish you could have a musical dialogue with them,” said Karl Hyde of Underworld in reference to his Barking co-creators. “In many ways, I think that [Underworld] could have grown faster and gone in richer directions if we could have had one or two conversations with those people.”
Hyde’s insight speaks effectively to the growth of the genre in the last decade, aided greatly by the Internet and the emergence of bedroom producers such as Anoraak and The Bloody Beetroots, whose unique reworking of tracks has garnered critical and commercial acclaim.
Today, Underworld represents a rare dance act whose roots and rise can be traced back to major record labels.
“Even in the late ’80s, what attracted us to dance music was the idea of reinvention,” Hyde said. “We come from a background of pop music where bands are encouraged to keep the same sound. Dance music isn’t like that. It’s like ‘Here’s a 12-inch. You like that? Here’s another 12-inch. Who’s that by? Oh, it’s by the same person. But it doesn’t sound like them. Well, it’s not meant to — it’s just meant to be a great track.’”
Indeed, the transition from earlier artists such as Underworld and Daft Punk, with decidedly synthetic sonics, to modern outfits like Cut Copy and The Knife that have combined classic grooves with the organic aesthetics of everything from guitar pop to tribal chants echoes such sentiment — one that Hard seems determined to exhibit with this year’s lineup.
“I can remember being back in Los Angeles, having no money and living on someone’s sofa in Hollywood,” Hyde said. “The first time we played there was at The Roxy, for about 23 people.”
According to Hyde, extensive touring has contributed to the band’s current sound, a practice that computer dance artists would do well to match.
“We’ve developed most of our tunes on the road, in reaction to live audiences,” Hyde said. “We come back to the studio, tweak it, go back on the road, tweak it and go back out again.”
Back in the studio, Hyde and Underworld member Rick Smith approach their work with labored musicianship and craft, striving for natural compositions.
“Rick is the producer — he has quite a vision,” Hyde said with a chuckle. “Even after all these years, sometimes, I don’t get it. It takes me months and I’ll go ‘Ah! That’s what you’re talking about.’ He finds ways to articulate a groove and writes great chords.”
In addition to providing the lead vocals for the band, Hyde also plays guitars for the band’s tracks. But he considers his real strength to be creating poetic lyrics.
“I love playing with the human voice,” he said.
Underworld’s contemplative method in creating dance tracks, draws from what Hyde called “a deep well of history” — from Smith’s childhood background in church music to contemporary acts such as noise-rock band HEALTH, which Hyde said he to admired.
These influences become tangible in the pulse behind works such as “Cowgirl” and “Two Weeks Notice,” which are not content to simply drop a fat bass and drums riff into a packed floor but labor toward that climax with the patience and stages of a symphony.
For those attending Underworld’s Sunday Hard performance, the significance of this approach, in heightening electronic dance music’s artistic credibility and elevating it far above the distraction of drug cultures, will be unveiled in aural oblivion.
“That process of looking for the next exciting sounds is built into the blood of dance music and I love that,” Hyde said. “It just keeps evolving.”
It’s all a matter of opinion… I’d go to Monster Massive over Hard any day.

Trio House is the Wal-Mart of Asian cuisine — cheap, diverse, customer-friendly and offering decent bang for your buck.
Photo by Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
Don’t think of Panda Express or Hong Kong Express as your only half-satisfying Asian fix near campus. As it turns out, there is a decent place for some sit-down grub. Nothing here is ostentatiously pricey or something out of haute cuisine, but it hits the various cravings for Asian food — be they late-night pad thai cravings, dim sum dates or bulgogi hangover cures.
Sophia: From the outside, the place looks dingy. It’s tucked into the busy construction on Figueroa Street, indicated only by a tacky red sign that says “Trio House” in white letters.
But step inside, and the place is surprisingly elegant — a mix of Thai cultural relics and sleek modern touches.
This cultural mix is reflected on the menu as well: the bulk of the offerings are Thai dishes, but other Asian dishes are incorporated, too, just in case a confused customer comes in demanding kung pao chicken.
Mimi: Growing up, my idea of great Chinese food came slathered in sweet and sour sauce, or deep-fried and stuffed with crab and cream cheese.
Since then, my palate, courtesy of Asian friends, has seen the light with authentic cuisine, but I make no yuppie claims to being a connoisseur of Asian cuisine.
Sophia: But that doesn’t matter at Trio House. It isn’t looking for customers snobby about authenticity. Its purpose is to satisfy all tastes with big portions, affordable prices and an extensive menu.
We started out with an appetizer that plays to the fusion theme: the Buddha Dumplings, which are steamed chicken dumplings swimming in a pool of green curry sauce, dressed up with fresh basil leaves and diced red bell peppers.
Mimi: The dumplings are a good preview of what Trio House has to offer — its food won’t knock your socks off, but it is a nice start to a meal with friends.
The green curry only has a mild kick, perfect for my spice-fearing palate. Those who did not grow up eating Mexican, Indian or super spicy Asian food should feel comfortable knowing Trio House won’t burn your mouth off unless you ask it to.
Sophia: That’s sad for me, because as a person who downs kimchi and chili oil with spaghetti, I was waiting for a kick that never came.
I also didn’t appreciate the chicken in the dumplings. To me, because the dumpling wrapper is relatively flavorless, you need a meatier, bolder filling. Otherwise, the dumplings ought to be fried like Japanese gyoza for some more oomph.
Though I found the appearance of the dish pleasing and the concept interesting, the execution was bland and disappointing.
Mimi: A better appetizer would be the chicken satay, slabs of grilled chicken served with a peanut sauce that tops any other dressing in the restaurant. Tangy and sweet, consider ordering this to go if you have a football game to watch and Wingstop’s line is out the door.
Sophia: Noodles are clearly the centerpiece of the house. They dominate about three-quarters of the menu and range from the familiar Thai classic pad thai, to blues-chasing tempura udon soup bowls and fusion drunken spaghetti.
Mimi: For a Thai-restaurant standard, the pad thai was satisfyingly sweet and punchy to my American taste buds, even if a real Thai diner might scoff. But it’s definitely a meal to share — the noodles threatened to spill over the banks of my plate, and finding chicken bits was an adventure not unlike the Yukon gold rush.
For something different, get the shrimp lad-nah, which is similar to pad see ew, another safe bet for those just now knocking on the door of Thai cuisine. The thick, pappardelle-like rice noodles will slide off your chopsticks from the rich, sweet soy sauce-based gravy.
You might want to ask for extra veggies if you like the crunchy stems, but the flavors are perfect for a wet fall day. Trio House has a heavy hand with the oil, so grab a napkin or two.
Sophia: The dish isn’t supposed to be diet-conscious with noodles cooked in PAM spray and low-fat vegetable broth. It’s a Thai dish influenced by the Chinese, and the Chinese love their oil.
Lard-na is a Laotian-Chinese dish that features fried noodles that form crispy charred edges before being doused in rich gravy. It might not sit well with Hollywood stars, but that’s the way it is served in the streets in Asia, and it’s wonderful.
In fact, I would say the dish wasn’t oily or charred enough compared to the ones I had in Southeast Asia. But as far as flavor goes, it was satisfying and delicious.
As for the noodle soups, skip them, especially if you’re a slow eater. The Wonton & BBQ Pork Noodle soup we got came with soggy noodles that seemed to have drowned in the broth, and the wontons were limp and mushy.
The broth was flavorful but was missing the intensity of the slow-cooked meaty broth that you might find in the mom-and-pop street food stalls in Asia.
If you must, request that your noodle soup be served immediately, as ingredients like noodles and wontons just lose their firm, bouncy texture when they stay in hot broth for too long.
Mimi: My take on the Wonton & BBQ Pork Noodle is similar. The broth brings to mind sick days with obligatory bowls of comforting chicken noodle soup, but the actual noodles were overcooked and the wontons were oversoaked and gummy. Also, there was romaine lettuce floating around. Greens can be tasty in soups, but romaine always tastes strange when hot.
Sophia: As far as Asian restaurants go, Trio House is decent enough for an Asian to enter with dignity. It won’t be a feast fit for Buddha, but for a quick Asian fix, Trio House will bring you some good eats, as long as you don’t come expecting true authenticity.

College students, especially seniors, are bombarded every day with the ever-growing pressure of the future. Scott Smith’s self-help book Find Your Perfect Job promises to eliminate all the stress and false expectations of the incumbently frantic job search.
Surface level · The book’s advice is just basic information. - Photo courtesy of Scott Smith 
In 136 pages, the Ivy League-educated holder of a law degree and master’s degree in business administration attempts to condense an entire life experience — and what some might call a developmental stage — into bolded headlines and catchphrases.
Self-help books, truthfully, cannot do much to jumpstart a burgeoning career, besides take a $20 bill out of the buyer’s pocket. The very least the text can do is inspire the reader or at least share the author’s story to set a good example or warn against the pitfalls of the universe.
Find Your Perfect Job hardly does any of that. Smith instead reminisces about his own experiences and, in the end, narrows the perfect job to a career involving business, consulting or law.
At some points, he does outline truly useful advice. It’s the kind of advice, however, that the Career Planning & Placement Center e-mails to students daily. It’s the kind of advice that can be found on an Internet forum. It’s even the kind of advice, one can say, that most semi-functional students have already heard and taken to heart.
Smith advises readers to ask themselves what they excel at, what they enjoy and strongly urges them to thoroughly contemplate the decision to attend graduate school.
Really, Smith? Sure, the young and naïve can appreciate encouraging words such as “Go for it” and “Think about what you aren’t good at, and avoid those things.”
At one point, however, the reader just has to say, “Well, duh.”
Though the point of the book is to get to the heart of what inexperienced upstarts need to do to achieve their every career dream, the straightforward nature combined with the simplistic language just smacks of an elongated memo. Smith’s piece seems like something a professor would hand out as a quick required reading on the first day of a business administration class.
When reading the author’s biography, however, one has to play devil’s advocate. Smith has, according to the back cover of his work, “succeeded in multiple careers in the business, legal and academic worlds.” The biography then drops that he has worked at a major Hollywood movie studio, the United States government, Wall Street, a law firm and even a world-renowned university, citing his “perfect job” as an equity analyst in investment management.
That’s quite the career path. You have to wonder: After all that trouble, why does he sideline from his fancy financial job to write a book that’s thin enough to be in the young adult section but reads like a cheaply produced pamphlet?
Perhaps it is this book’s weakness that also serves as its greatest strength. For the purely directionless, any guidance can be good. Plus, practical lists about preparing for the interview serve as useful information.
Additionally, the introspective chapter that examines what the individual reader wants out of a specific job has the potential to be motivational and useful to someone who really hasn’t thought about his future livelihood in such a standardized and organized manner.
As the current entry-level generation tries to break into the imperfect work force picked  by societal change and a not-so-distant recession, we have to think outside the box — and outside the book.
No matter how much research or preparation you might do, no matter how clean and tight each custom-printed résumé, cover letter and business card might look, there simply aren’t enough jobs to go around.
Smith doesn’t account for that gritty reality in his cheery book, but realism and self-help books might not be the coziest of friends. This problem is bigger than Smith’s playbook; the flaw is within an entire industry that is three years too late and hopelessly behind.
It’s not that young people don’t respond to books or publishing initiatives; it’s that they’ve heard it all before. They know they should anticipate to be two steps ahead of their peers; they know what an elevator speech entails. They need guidance from someone who doesn’t have two master degrees and a wealth of academic experience to talk down to them.
This SAT score-obsessed generation raised by helicopter parents needs to just figure it out on its own.
There is no definitive outline for the post-graduate universe, which can be frightening. Perfect Job is one of the many texts that tries to help others grapple with that vague and immediate future. Its creator might have an impressive pedigree and might mean well, but his piece ends up as a glorified packet that can be found in any community college advisement office.
Well-read or not, it’s up to the individual reader to chase the real dream.
It appears Clare has spent more time writing a clever review with many catch phrases in it than actually reading this book. I HAVE read this book, and it is VERY helpful and motivating. It never talks down to its readers. Not sure what book Clare read, but this one is definitely inspiring and definitely helps readers avoid the pitfalls of the career world. Can you find all this advice sitting there for free in a pamphlet in the career office? Not a chance. For example, there are over 20 pages alone that comprise a gritty dissection of law school and the legal profession — not to be found in any career office. Don’t care about law as a career? The majority of the book is useful for any career. The book helps people clearly define their best fitting career path, whatever that may be, and then provides very helpful strategies to get your foot in the door. Of course there are things in any career book that people already know, but this book gets right to the point and amasses most of the best advice in one place. And it’s only $11 on Amazon, easily worth the price of a few Starbucks Frappuccinos, don’t you think? Congratulations to Clare for having figured her career out all on her own, but many college students aren’t as lucky as her and can desperately use an $11 career tool to give them the focus, motivation, and insider tips to achieve their career dreams, particularly in this horrible job market. Surprisingly, Clare dismisses all career/self-help books as unhelpful and tells you to “just figure it out on your own.” I can’t think of any worse advice…..
“At some points, he does outline truly useful advice. It’s the kind of advice, however, that the Career Planning & Placement Center e-mails to students daily. It’s the kind of advice that can be found on an Internet forum. It’s even the kind of advice, one can say, that most semi-functional students have already heard and taken to heart.” -platitudes

Considering the musical focus of the hit television show Glee, it shouldn’t be surprising that one of the actors, Mark Salling, has been involved in music off the set.
Stick to covers · Salling is better when Auto-Tuned. - Photo courtesy of Pipe Dreams Records  
It might be for the best, however, if the musical aspect of his career remains within the confines of the show. Salling, who is known for playing Noah “Puck” Puckerman on Glee, recently released his solo album, Pipe Dreams, which is an unfortunately fitting title for an album full of characterless, forgettable songs.
Pipe Dreams has a mellow, soft-rock, singer-songwriter vibe that brings no urgency to the music and an earnest atmosphere that lets the listeners know just how serious Salling is about every cheesy song on the album.
In addition to the songs being unfulfilling, the lyrics are strange and distractingly wordy — occasionally cringe-inducing — the instrumentals are nothing special and Salling’s vocals are weak at best. All together, the album is simply bad. It’s like burnt toast — it might have had some potential before but now there’s nothing that can make it better.
The album starts off with the underwhelming “Migration,” which is the only song listeners need to hear, because every song on Pipe Dreams sounds exactly like the one that comes before it.
Salling introduces listeners to his puzzling lyrical style with lines about “metaphors,” “dinosaurs” and “proclamations.” The lyrics are entertaining in their own right, but only because they are awkward, bizarre and excessively wordy.
The third song, “Higher Power,” is an OK song, but that might just be within the context of the album. It’s arguably the best song on Pipe Dreams, which doesn’t give it much credit, but it has some potential, the instrumental work is alright and it has the best melody.
In fact, the melody sounds like a lethargic copy of Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive,” which is a good explanation for why it’s enjoyable at all.
Unfortunately, the underwhelmingly bland first three tracks do nothing to prepare listeners for “Mary Poppins.”
With cringe-worthy lyrics such as Why can’t I believe in Mary Poppins? delivered in Salling’s raspy, nasally, earnest croon, this song might drive buyers to dump the entire CD straight into the trash. The lyrics are beyond cheesy and, sadly for Salling, the song sounds like a joke that went horribly wrong.
The rest of the album is unremarkable, but not as awful as “Mary Poppins.”
“Musical Soulmate” is a sleepy lullaby while “Illusions” sounds like a bad Maroon 5 cover with a psychedelic twist and awkward tempo changes.
In “Doppelganger,” Salling manages to rip off Sugar Ray while also deviating into some pseudo-rapping that sounds oddly similar to both Crazy Town and Aaron Carter at the same time.
Pipe Dreams lacks its own distinct musical style and instead sounds as if it were influenced by an agglomeration of artists such as Pearl Jam, Sublime, Beck and the Beatles. Even Salling himself described the musical style on his album as “kind of all over the place” in an interview with Idolator.com.
The album ends on a more underwhelming note than it begins on with the final song, “Fugitive,” leaving listeners with the feeling that they sat through an unfinished basement demo.
Even after two full listens, it’s still nearly impossible to distinguish the songs from one another and remember the individual melodies. Every song leaves something to be desired in terms of creativity.
Although it’s not surprising that Salling’s music sounds different from the songs he sings on Glee, people familiar with the show will probably feel let down.
Following popular Glee performances of songs such as “Sweet Caroline,” “The Lady is a Tramp” and “Only the Good Die Young,” which were upbeat and suited his vocal range, Salling’s album is especially disappointing.
Pipe Dreams certainly isn’t the worst album ever made, but it definitely is not anything above downright awful. It’s bland and absolutely forgettable — at least most listeners will want to forget it. If they don’t pull faces and roll their eyes while listening to this album, then they’re not listening properly.
Despite his solo effort, Salling is better off doing karaoke for the Auto-Tune gods of Glee.

Halloween is right around the corner — the corner in this case being Sunday — and if you are anything like me, the holiday is a great excuse to combine two of my favorite things in the world: hanging out with good friends and watching horror movies.
We’ve all seen the old horror classics: The Exorcist, The Shining, Texas Chainsaw Massacre — which, as Patton Oswalt so insightfully realizes is “the best movie title of all time” — The Omen, The Evil Dead and Carrie.
Don’t get me wrong. These are awesome movies. They’ll scare your pants off. But if you’re looking to branch out cinematically this Halloween, here are five films off the beaten path that are guaranteed to make you afraid of the dark.
The Tenant
The last of Polanski’s famed urban trilogy (Repulsion and Rosemary’s Baby — two great Halloween watches by the way), it is without question my favorite Polanski film, topping the likes of Chinatown and The Pianist.
Polanski himself stars as Trelkovsky, an ordinary man who has the misfortune of renting an apartment formerly occupied by Simone Choule, a woman who hurled herself out of her apartment window.
What could have driven her to this? Much like the suicide in Rosemary’s Baby, the key to the film lies in the answer to this question. Driven to a state of near delirium by his antagonistic neighbors, Trelkovsky slowly finds himself turning into the dead woman, going as far as dressing up in drag. Driven by shear terror and paranoia, he is a man fighting to hold onto his very identity.
In The Tenant, Polanski gives us a truly terrifying psychological thriller that will leave you on the very edge of your seat as he finally declares: “I am not Simone Choule.”
Don’t Look Now
Most unfortunately, Don’t Look Now is best known for the graphic and controversial sex scene between stars Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland (trust me — in 1973 this wasn’t as disgusting an image), obscuring the fact that it is one of the best thriller and horror classics of all time.
Christie and Sutherland play a middle-aged couple haunted by the death of their young daughter — a scene which is one of the more emotionally moving I’ve ever encountered in the horror genre. In order to escape from the heartbreak, they take a vacation in Venice, but each are haunted by ghostly premonitions which seem to foreshadow their own deaths.
Based on the short story Don’t Look Now by Daphne du Maurier, the film offers both thrills and chills while also exploring the fine line between reality and the hereafter, sanity and insanity.
By the end, you will not only be terrified, you will also have acquired an acute phobia of red-cloaked dwarves.
Suspiria
Like The Tenant, Suspiria is one part of a famed director’s trilogy. This time, it’s Dario Argento’s The Three Mothers trilogy (also including Inferno and The Mother of Tears).
A cult phenomenon, Suspiria is well-known to many yet watched by surprisingly few. This is unfortunate, as the master of horror’s masterpiece is truly chilling to behold.
It elegantly spins a story about a young American dancer (Suzy Bannion) who unknowingly enters a witch’s coven believing it to be a prestigious dance school. A series of supernatural events unfold, causing young Suzy to doubt the appearance of her surroundings. By the time she discovers the truth, it is too late.
Perhaps best known for its unforgettably traumatic murder scene, Suspiria is, however, much more than cheap thrills. It is the Cadillac of the horror genre, one of the most beautifully shot and designed horror flicks of all time.
High Tension
Roger Ebert gives this Alexander Aja production one of four stars. This can mean one of two things: either Ebert has lost his touch or I have no taste. Even though I’d put my money on the latter rather than the former, High Tension (also known as Haute Tension in France and Switchblade Romance in England) is well worth your time this Halloween.
The best I can describe it as is Saw meets Memento, which is a sinfully subpar comparison that is nonetheless guaranteed to make you want to see this film.
If you’re a fan of gore, you most assuredly should. It is a simple exploitation story about two young French women who are hunted in the countryside by a nameless, faceless killer. Their mission is simple: survive. Echoing the title, after the relatively slow first 15 minutes, Aja never lets up on the tension or the gore, making you want to turn away while at the same time forcing you to watch — the best kind of horror film.
If you can, get your hands on the original French cut. The American version features subpar dubbing and is edited down two minutes to drop the original NC-17 rating to an R.
Jaws
What can I say? It’s the best monster movie of all time, yet for some reason, come Halloween, everyone seems to forget it. This is inexplicable to me, because it might just be the best Halloween film out there. Think about it — what could top getting some buds and brews together this Sunday and screening Jaws? Sure, everyone’s seen it a dozen times, but that’s the genius.
You can Mystery Science Theater 3000 the thing, reciting lines and taking shots every time Quint says or does something awesome. You will not find a better group movie watching experience. I guarantee, however, by the end, when Jaws is munching on the Orca, ain’t nobody sayin’ nothin’.
So, have fun this weekend. Be safe. And, if you watch these films, be scared. It is Halloween, after all. What else are you going to do — watch romantic comedies?

The Keck School of Medicine welcomes the new Eli and Edythe Broad CIRM Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research today with the grand opening of a $80-million, five-story building.
The dedication ceremony will begin at 10:30 a.m. and will include a ribbon cutting, speeches and tours following the celebration of the 87,500-square foot building located on the Health Sciences Campus.
Keck School Dean Carmen Puliafito, USC President C.L. Max Nikias, State Sen. Gloria Romero, building donors Eli and Edythe Broad, and representatives from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine will be present at the ceremony.
The Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation, a Los-Angeles based national philanthropy aiming to “advance entrepreneurship for the public good in education, science and the arts” according to its mission statement, donated $30 million toward the development of the building, in addition to CIRM’s $27-million gift. Additional donations for the building were made by private philanthropists.
The building received a silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design designation, the first LEED designation on the HSC. The structure earned its designation for its eco-friendly design, which incorporated a unique low-iron glass and an HVAC system that uses water instead of air for cooling.
The center, which is the newest addition to the group of biomedical research centers on the HSC, will house three areas of study: stem cell, preclinical and clinical research.
“Our goal in investing in this world-class center at USC is to create an integral hub for stem cell research in Southern California,” Eli Broad told Keck news. “This innovative building represents the infinite possibilities for medical discovery by researchers drawn from around the world.”

Four decades after being built, USC’s Hillel center received renovations last summer after receiving funding from the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles.
Renovations began in early May, after the center hosted an event honoring former USC President Steve B. Sample. Renovations concluded before move-in week in August.
The building was very run-down before the improvements, said Michael Jeser, executive director of Hillel. It was filled with donated items and used, torn up furniture. The flooring hadn’t been replaced in more than a decade, which Jeser said caused the building to lack a welcoming, modern atmosphere.
“[We wanted] to upgrade the facility, make it more welcoming and open for students,” Jeser said. “[We wanted to] create more of a space that students could use for recreational, social, and academic purposes.”
Modernization was a key part in the renovation, Jeser said. New furniture, flooring, glass windows and paint brought a more contemporary atmosphere to the building.
“It used to be empty, like a warehouse feel. There were a few couches, but now there are dedicated spaces that students can use for meetings, social activities, and watching movies,” Jeser said.
Cameron Roth, USC Hillel student president, said the new additions to the center automatically welcome students and make them feel more comfortable.
“The first day people came back, people walked in the door and went straight to these lounge areas. No one used to come over here; it was uninviting,” said Roth, who also said he was glad to see the new wheelchair-accessible ramp at the University Walk entrance.
A new drought-tolerant landscape was installed outside in order to help the environment, Jeser said. Other water-saving features were also installed in the bathrooms.
“People feel more comfortable coming in with the change to the exterior,” Roth said. “Now people notice the building is here and they want to peek in. Getting them interested on their own is a great way to get them to come to events.”
More entertainment and audiovisual equipment have been added as well. A large flat-screen TV greets visitors at the entrance to Hillel, with slideshows of activities and announcements. Two more flat screens occupy the building, and all TVs have Direct TV. Other technology upgrades include free WiFi throughout the building and video surveillance for enhanced security.
The Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles, which contributes the most funding to Hillel, played a vital role in the renovation. The Real Estate Principals Organization, which is affiliated with the Jewish Federation and led by USC alumnus Jon Monkarsh, donated $75,000 to help fund the renovations.
“It really is with great pride that we have supported Hillel at the federation, and especially the contribute we made to this facility. Not only the financial contribution but the time and the effort we put in,” said Richard Sandler, chairman of the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles. “Here at Hillel, you are carrying forward really the greatest traditions of our culture, and that is education and values.”
The renovation effort was led by USC Hillel Chairman Jaime Gesundheit. Gesundheit, who is an alumnus from the School of Architecture, spearheaded the entire design effort, with assistance from designer Nichole Sassaman.
On Wednesday evening, Hillel celebrated the “Extreme Hillel Makeover” with keynote speaker President C.L. Max Nikias. Nikias spoke about the relationship between USC and the Jewish community, and the importance of a strong, vibrant Hillel at USC.
“[Hillel] helps our students connect to the rest of the university and the larger world. USC Hillel plays an important role of connecting the students today with the traditions of the past,” Nikias said. “As president of USC I pledge to you that this partnership will continue. This Hillel will flourish.”
Members of the USC Board of Trustees — including Dr. Andrew Viterbi, Stanley P. Gold, Kenneth Leventhal, Alan Casden and Daniel Epstein — participated in a Jewish ceremony to celebrate the opening of the newly renovated building.
“When people feel comfortable enough to treat this place like a home instead of another university building, that’s when you know Hillel has done its job,” Roth said. “We can provide any amount of programming but nothing beats a home away from home.”

Newly elected USC Provost Elizabeth Garrett said she didn’t think it was a coincidence that she has similar goals as President C.L. Max Nikias for the university.
Moving on up · Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett says she wants to make USC even more residential and bring more faculty in. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
“I really do share a lot of his fundamental academic values and principals,” Garrett said. “I would say that most of the academic leadership of this university has very complimentary and compatible visions and goals.”
These goals, she said, are driving her excitement for working with deans, faculty, staff and students as provost and senior vice president of academic affairs.
USC announced Thursday that Garrett will officially fill the position of provost at the university, after having spent several months as interim provost during the search period.
The search for provost began in April, after it was announced that Nikias would be leaving the position to become president of the university. The search committee chose Garrett out of 225 candidates.
Garrett, who served as a USC administrator for five years in the provost’s office, said her main goal, along with Nikias’, is to enhance the residential student experience at USC through programs and academic activities.
“We need to solidify that residential quality and the vibrancy of the campus for our students and the faculty,” she said.
Life on campus has changed during recent years, she said, from being an empty campus at night to having students everywhere on campus in the evenings.
“Part of the university I love is the chaos: the chaos of the classroom, the chaos of a research lab, the chaos of writing an article,” Garrett said. “That’s part of being in the university.”
Other goals include continuing to push for USC’s globalization efforts and outreach, utilizing the university’s hospitals and continuing to recruit nationally renowned faculty.
“The more we can do within the academic community, the better,” she said. “I see a university as equipping people to make a difference in the world.”
She would also like to see greater and stronger Ph.D. programs, she said, to enhance the research that is happening at USC.
“This is a critical time for our Ph.D. programs,” Garrett said. “We have even more that are really at the cusp of becoming the truly great Ph.D.s in the country.”
Garrett began her career in law, with past experiences working as a clerk for late Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and serving as the co-director of the USC-Caltech Center for the Study of Law and Politics. She is also a professor in the USC Gould School of Law.
It is this experience working with students that will inform her job as provost, she said.
“What we’re doing is helping people learn tools and learn how to ask the right questions to make a difference,” Garrett said. “Teaching students has given me great love and appreciation for what goes on in the classroom.”
In her time at USC, Garrett said she learned from both former President Steven B. Sample and current President Nikias.
“I’ve had the fortune to watch two great leaders in my time here,” she said. “Working with President Nikias has been terrific. He’s been a tremendous leader and role model for me.”
Congratulations to Elizabeth Garrett on her new position.  As a premier national university drawing students from 50 states and many countries, USC’s effort to “enhance the residential student experience” is long overdue.  If your focus is on the needs of USC’s residential students, please remember that those students travel great distances to be a Trojan.  
I suggest revising the academic calendar to lengthen the Thanksgiving holiday.  Many other prestigious universities have adopted this calendar change.  When scheduling Thanksgiving travel plans, USC parents have a difficult decision to make: arrange student travel on Wednesday and pay more, or allow their student to leave campus early/miss classes to secure a more reasonable travel fare.  Early in the fall, we ask our sons/daughters to predict if the professor will ultimately cancel Wednesday (or even Tuesday) classes.  They worry if earlier travel plans will cause them to miss academic material.   
Please take this suggestion under consideration and show USC parents that you are serious about accommodating the residential students.  Thank you.

USC College Democrats and Republicans said they hold opposing viewpoints for Proposition 24, which aims to repeal $1.7 billion in tax breaks that corporations would receive, starting in January 2011.
The tax break legislature that was approved in 2009 — which would be repealed by Prop 24 — is split into three main components; the single sales factor, the ability to carry back losses and tax credit sharing.
The single sales factor will allow corporations to pick which category — from sales, payroll or property — that they will be taxed on rather than being taxed on all three. Corporations that are struggling will be able to receive refunds for taxes paid in the last two years, and tax credit sharing would allow corporations to spread their tax credits among their affiliated businesses.
USC College Democrats said they would endorse Proposition 24, Repeal of Corporate Tax Breaks.
“This is a no-brainer; corporate tax loopholes are not helping the economy; the money should be going to education. Proposition 24 allows this money to go where it belongs,” said Micah Scheindlin, political director of the USC College Democrats.
USC College Republicans President Katherine Cook said the group is urging voters to vote no on Proposition 24 because the existing law attracts new business to California, which helps create jobs.
“This legislation makes it easier for businesses to stay afloat, for Californians to start their own new businesses, and keeps existing businesses in California,” Cook said. She also emphasized the importance of keeping and creating new jobs, citing California’s current 12.4 percent unemployment rate.
Voting yes on this proposition would repeal all aspects of the above legislature, while voting no would enable it to continue without any changes.
“The state government estimates that if [the legislation] went into effect, the short run cost would be $700 million in reduced tax collections. However, in the long run, it would attract more businesses to California, creating more jobs and expanding the tax base,” said Charles Swenson, professor at the Marshall School of Business, who is also an expert on taxation policy and economics.
According to a Public Policy Institute of California statewide survey, there is no firm majority hold on the issue at present, with 31 percent of voters in favor of the proposition, 38 percent against and 31 percent undecided.
Julius Cotton, a senior majoring in business administration, said he already voted in favor of the proposition because if passed, the new law would redirect capital to citizens in California.
“The tax breaks are just corporations buying their way out of trouble at the expense of citizens,” Cotton said.
“I would vote to give corporations a break as an incentive to finally do something useful,” said Samantha Ma, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering.
Proposition 24 holds a lot of weight with both California businesses and citizens alike who are ultimately hoping to bring the state out of its dire financial situation. If the proposition passes, corporations estimate between 146,000 and 322,000 lost jobs, according to an economic analysis by Claremont McKenna College.
“This is a really technical issue which is best handled by the legislature. Voters should not be forced to try to understand this,” Swenson said.
Of course corporations do not pay taxes, they just pass them along to customers.  That said, there is no such thing as a tax ‘break,’ since it is not the government’s money in the first place (although years of government schooling lead some to forget that inconvenient truth).
“This is a really technical issue which is best handled by the legislature. Voters should not be forced to try to understand this,” Swenson said.
ENOUGH SAID.
not voting on this (prop 24) is the solution.
I agree its too difficult to determine which is better: corporations vs the government. either way, somebody gonna lose money.
The referendum process in this state is damaging.  How can any business, orgainzation or the State PLAN when faced with the uncertainty of propositions each election?
I plan to vote no. It sounds like it is changing one set of tax breaks for another.

USC students were geared up and excited this week about the Pac-10 Fitness Challenge, during which the Lyon Center also offers special fitness classes, massages and programs for students.
“It is been a lot of fun and high energy throughout the Lyon Center and all week,”
said Justine Gilma, director of fitness and recreational facilities. “It is marketing tool and university promotion to inspire people to work out and generate USC school spirit.”
The Pac-10 competition is in its fourth year. It promotes students to live a healthier lifestyle by recoding every minute they work out.
USC students said they were enthused about the competition.
“It’s fun to have everybody be enthusiastic about it. I always want to beat UCLA and it’s always fun to have that crosstown rivalry,” said Emily Friedberg, a junior majoring in health and humanity and Spanish. “It’s also great to prove that we are the most fit, because so much of the student body goes to the gym all the time.”
Friedberg said at one point it got so crowded at the registration table on Wednesday that she had actually had to turn people away at the competition’s closing time.
Last year, USC faculty participated with 19,536 minutes of working out while students participated with 125,8724 minutes. While other participating alumni and supporters also recorded their workout times for the competition, USC brought in more than 170,000 minutes of workout time for the competition
Gilman said USC has recorded the workouts of more than 1,200 students so far.
“We have gotten the word out about the competition through e-mails, Facebook, the Lyon Center lobby registration, word of mouth. We are improving each year,” said Director of Recreational Sports and Programs Gabriel Valenzuela.
Maddie Mejia, a senior majoring in architecture, has helped promote the competition for three years. She said the best part is seeing the amount of student enthusiasm.
“I think when students see how close we are especially with UCLA they get really into it and they tell more people. It’s awesome,” she said.
Certified massage therapist and USC alumna Erin Garberson said she loves being a massage therapist at the gym during this time
“The students are pretty excited. The assignment sheet was filled. It makes me feel good to really help people and make people feel better,” she said.
Garberson also said she hopes students realize working out is not just exercising — it’s a mental activity as well. Massages and any type of fitness are great ways for students to release stored emotion.
“If students are exercising to the point of exhaustion, [that] is not good,” Garberson said. “It is good to exercise to relieve stress, but it should be within reason.”
Meijia — who loves running — said she believes that the Pac-10 competition provides a great learning experience for students for how to better take care of themselves.
“I love [encouraging] people into doing fitness. It’s personal, but as a school doing it together … is awesome too,” she said.

The USC women’s cross-country team knows that it’s in for a challenge at this weekend’s Pac-10 Cross Country Championships, but according to USC coach Tom Walsh, if there’s any team ready for a challenge, it’s his.

“Our girls have trained the correct way,” Walsh said. “We’ve done the workouts right. We’re ready.”
The Women of Troy will need to be ready when they travel to Seattle, Wash., to take on some of the best teams in the country. Walsh knows the powerhouses like Oregon, Stanford and Washington that await his squad will be tough to beat, but he still has confidence that USC will impress anyone who counts it out.
“Yes, we’re battling for that middle of the pack,” Walsh said. “But this team has a reputation for coming on strong at the end of races. If everyone runs their best race, we’ll be fine.”
USC will use its seven best runners to try and make a significant dent in the Pac-10 placing. Senior Zsofia Erdelyi, who won the Cal State Northridge meet individual title earlier this month, will likely battle with some of the best runners on the West Coast for another first-place title in Seattle.
“Zsofia runs best when she’s at the front,” Walsh said. “I like her staying with the lead pack and then surging at the end. She should be right up there with the best.”
The rest of USC’s squad is made up of both youth and experience. Joining Erdelyi are seniors Christine Cortez, Dina Kitayama and Zara Lukens. Juniors Leah Gaeta and Jessica Lundin and sophomore Kelly Owen round out USC’s top seven. Walsh indicated that his seniors have to step up for the Women of Troy to exceed expectations.
“I’m looking for Christine Cortez and the other seniors to have another breakthrough,” Walsh said. “They’ve been doing it all year.”
Walsh also believes that the race, which will be run at what he called a “flat and fast” Jefferson Golf Course in Seattle, could teeter on who gets out to a strong start.
“We absolutely have to be aggressive,” Walsh said. “Everyone gets out so fast at Pac-10s. If you don’t get out fast, you’re in trouble.”
Before the gun even goes off, however, Walsh said USC already has a couple advantages.
“There’s rain in the forecast and we have several runners who hail from bad-weather areas,” Walsh said. “I feel like that will help.”
The other advantage, however, is much more important.
“We finally have momentum,” Walsh said. “It’s something we haven’t had the past few years. We’ve had a great year and I’m looking forward to seeing how we stack up against the best.”
Deficits did NOT cause the disposal of UC Berkeley sports. UC Berkeley’s Leadership Crisis
UC Berkeley’s recent elimination of popular sports programs highlighted endemic problems in the university’s management.  Chancellor Robert Birgeneau’s eight-year fiscal track record is dismal indeed.  He would like to blame the politicians in Sacramento, since they stopped giving him every dollar he has asked for, and the state legislators do share some responsibility for the financial crisis.  But not in the sense he means.
A competent chancellor would have been on top of identifying inefficiencies in the system and then crafting a plan to fix them.  Competent oversight by the Board of Regents and the legislature would have required him to provide data on problems and on what steps he was taking to solve them.  Instead, every year Birgeneau would request a budget increase, the regents would agree to it, and the legislature would provide.  The hard questions were avoided by all concerned, and the problems just piled up to $150 million of inefficiencies….until there was no money left.
It’s not that Birgeneau was unaware that there were, in fact, waste and inefficiencies in the system.  Faculty and staff have raised issues with senior management, but when they failed to see relevant action taken, they stopped.  Finally, Birgeneau engaged some expensive ($3 million) consultants, Bain & Company, to tell him what he should have been able to find out from the bright, engaged people in his own organization.  
From time to time, a whistleblower would bring some glaring problem to light, but the chancellor’s response was to dig in and defend rather than listen and act.  Since UC has been exempted from most whistleblower lawsuits, there are ultimately no negative consequences for maintaining inefficiencies.
In short, there is plenty of blame to go around.  But you never want a serious crisis to go to waste.  An opportunity now exists for the UC president, Board of Regents, and California legislators to jolt UC Berkeley back to life, applying some simple check-and-balance management principles.  Increasing the budget is not enough; transforming senior management is necessary.  The faculty, Academic Senate, Cal. Alumni, financial donators, benefactors and await the transformation.
The author, who has 35 years’ consulting experience, has taught at University of California Berkeley, where he was able to observe the culture and the way the senior management operates.

It will be quite an emotional weekend at McAlister Field.
Pushing ahead · Freshman midfielder Autumn Altamirano dribbles the ball forward against Northern Arizona earlier this season. The freshman scored the decisive goal to beat UCLA 1-0 in the Women of Troy’s last game. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The No. 23 USC women’s soccer team (9-4-3, 2-2-1) will take on the Washington State Cougars (6-11-0, 1-5-0) today at 3 p.m. at McAlister, and will then face the Washington Huskies (10-6-1, 3-3-0) at the same spot on Sunday at 1 p.m. for Senior Day.
“It’s crazy that we’re already seniors,” said senior forward Megan Ohai. “It went by really fast.”
For USC coach Ali Khosroshahin, this is a special class. Khosroshahin came to the program in 2007, along with these seniors.
“These girls didn’t choose to come here because of me,” Khosroshahin said. “The fact that they kept their commitments, and just seeing how much they’ve grow over the four years — it’s tough. We’re excited for them to move on to the next stage in their lives, but it’s sad to see them leave. It’s bittersweet.”
With Senior Day scheduled for Sunday, it would be easy to overlook Friday’s match against Washington State.  But the players — especially the seniors — have some extra motivation. Aside from No. 1 Stanford, who hasn’t lost a Pac-10 game in nearly two years, Washington State is the only Pac-10 team Khosroshahin and the senior class have yet to beat.
“We told the girls that Wednesday at practice,” Khosroshahin said. “All the seniors looked at me like, ‘We haven’t?’ And I was like, ‘Nope.’ Hopefully that’ll give them some extra motivation.”
The teams have battled to scoreless ties the past two years, and Washington State took a 2-1 victory in Pullman in 2007.
“I remember them being a really tough team. They really study what their opponent is going to do, they know everything about you and they’ll do basically whatever they need,” Ohai said. “Their goal is to beat us and ruin our season. They know they’re not going to the tournament, they have nothing to lose. It’s going to be a tough one.”
Senior defender Karter Haug remained optimistic.
“We started out with UCLA [last week],” Haug said. “We had never beaten them before in Pac-10, so hopefully we’ll keep it going this weekend.”
In order to do so, the team knows its defense will have to continue the stellar play its displayed this season. Anchored by Haug, the Women of Troy backline has allowed just .93 goals per game, third in the Pac-10.
“Our defense is working really well together,” Haug said.
Khosroshahin agreed.
“They’ve done a good job playing as a unit,” Khosroshahin said. “They’ve been the backbone of the team this entire year.”

The second half of the Pac-10 season has begun, and the Women of Troy look to make their Homecoming weekend successful.
The No. 8 USC women’s volleyball team welcomes the No. 7 Washington Huskies and the Washington State Cougars to the Galen Center this weekend. The team won both of its games last weekend for the first time in a month, and USC coach Mick Haley hopes the momentum carries into the team’s upcoming games.
“I really feel like this weekend we need to have two really good efforts,” Haley said. “That’s what we’re pushing for.”
USC is hoping for redemption Saturday night as it faces Washington, the first team to hand the Women of Troy a loss this season when it defeated USC in five sets in Seattle.
“I didn’t think we were real sure of ourselves,” Haley said regarding USC’s first match this season against the Huskies. “I really felt like if we were a little bit more confident, we would have had a chance to steal one right there at Washington.”
Haley also said he believes his team is more prepared for this match than it was for the earlier match against the Huskies, though Washington has improved throughout the season as well.
Though Washington might appear to be the marquis game this weekend, Haley does not want to overlook the team’s first matchup this weekend against Washington State, a team that was swept by USC already this season and is still hungry to get its first Pac-10 win.
“We’ve got to play Washington State first, and they’re much improved also, so we can’t really focus on Washington until we get by Washington State,” Haley said. “I think Washington State moves the ball around. I think they’re going to challenge us every which way they can.”
The Women of Troy are currently tied for third in the conference with a record of 6-3. Despite the team’s most recent wins, Haley said he is still concerned about his young team’s focus, or more specifically, lack of focus.
“I just think it’s right in the middle of the conference schedule right now. It’s real tough for everybody to stay alert and stay real aggressive, so we’ve been trying to get that all week in practice to push through each time and keep trying to get better,” Haley said.
With a top-10 ranking and an overall record of 17-3, Haley cannot deny the talent of his team. For USC to come away with wins and move up in the conference standings, Haley is much more concerned with his team improving, rather than the strengths of any opponents. He specifically cited working on serving and serve reception.
“We’re good in those areas. If we can bring it every night, we’re going to be in every match,” Haley said.
The Women of Troy will play the Cougars tonight at 7 p.m. before playing a rare afternoon game Saturday against the Huskies at 3 p.m.

USC’s dynasty is over, but that’s old news.
Recent news, though, is Oregon and whether or not the Ducks will follow the Trojans’ nearly decade-long dynasty with one of their own.
Tomorrow’s game will go a long way toward determining whether or not that actually happens.
Why?
Yes, Oregon has been good for a while now — and, recently, very good, qualifying for the Rose Bowl last year for the first time in 14 years.
Yes, former coach Mike Bellotti and current coach Chip Kelly have each found a way to bring big prospects to Eugene in recent years — particularly from the state of Texas in the class of 2008, with both quarterback Darron Thomas (Houston) and running back LaMichael James (Texarkana) coming to school that year.
Yes, Kelly’s scheme confuses the living bejesus out of opponents and no, no one in the football world has come up with the antidote for it yet.
But the Ducks haven’t been that good, they haven’t recruited that well, and their scheme really isn’t all that different from the triple-option that’s been popular in college football for quite a while.
Think back a bit. The Ducks were burned with a very unlucky injury to quarterback Dennis Dixon in 2007, perhaps their best chance to make long-lasting noise on a national scale. Then, they fumbled their next big shot in 2009 when they fell to Ohio State, 26-17 in the Rose Bowl game and finished the season ranked No. 11 in the Coaches and Associated Press polls with three losses.
About recruiting: Kelly said it himself in his teleconference this week. On Oregon’s current depth chart, out of its top-two players at each position, the Ducks have no five-star recruits.
None. Eleven four-stars, though.
To compare, USC has 12 five-stars and 26 players with a four-star rating. That’s 38 of 44 players who were premiere, gourmet prospects, compared with just 11 of 44 — 25 percent — for Oregon. They’re simply not as talented as the Trojans are — at least not yet.
The scheme? It’s called a spread-option, but it’s not that similar to the traditional spread, really. Although Thomas can throw, it’s no throwing team. Thomas and James will run USC’s underperforming front seven silly this week unless the Trojans prove they can stop them.
Here’s the thing, though: During USC’s glory days, the Trojans’ offense was truly unstoppable. A team could maybe limit them but stopping them outright? Nearly impossible. But that essentially happened to Oregon in the Rose Bowl, giving USC hope.
Yes, the Trojans could conceivably hold Oregon to 17 points — not likely, but conceivable. If they stop them, USC could conceivably stop the entire Oregon offense. That hasn’t really happened under Kelly — save for the Rose Bowl, perhaps — but it seems entirely logical.
The Trojans realize all of this, but they also understand they are 6.5 point underdogs this week. Where USC was in about 2003, Oregon is now.
“Once upon a time, we were in their shoes,” senior fullback Stanley Havili said this week. “It was about every week it was like this, so we’re excited.”
“Excited” is an interesting word to use there. The Trojans are excited for two things, it appears, although they come hand in hand: One, to prove their legitimacy as the No. 24-ranked team  in the AP poll, and two, to dismiss the Ducks as the new Pac-10 leaders.
They definitely don’t feel comfortable passing any sort of torch, that’s for sure.
“I’m sure they respect us at opponents,” said senior linebacker Malcolm Smith. “I hope that they’re stepping their game up and making sure they’re ready for us as well.”
But when asked if Oregon would become the next USC with a win tomorrow, Smith dismissed the idea.
“No,” he said. “They’ll still be Oregon.”
Did UC Berkeley have to cancel sports? NO! When UC Berkeley announced its elimination of baseball, men’s and women’s gymnastics, and women’s lacrosse teams and its defunding of the national-champion men’s rugby team, the chancellor sighed, “Sorry, but this was necessary!”
But was it?  Yes, the university is in dire financial straits.  Yet $3 million was somehow found to pay the Bain consulting firm to uncover waste and inefficiencies in UC Berkeley, despite the fact that a prominent East Coast university was doing the same thing without consultants.
Essentially, the process requires collecting and analyzing information from faculty and staff.  Apparently, senior administrators at UC Berkeley believe that the faculty and staff of their world-class university lack the cognitive ability, integrity, and motivation to identify millions in savings.  If consultants are necessary, the reason is clear:  the chancellor, provost, and president have lost credibility with the people who provided the information to the consultants.  Chancellor Robert J Birgeneau has reigned for eight years, during which time the inefficiencies proliferated.  Even as Bain’s recommendations are implemented (“They told me to do it”, Birgeneau), credibility and trust problems remain.
Bain is interviewing faculty, staff, senior management and the academic senate leaders for $150 million in inefficiencies, most of which could have been found internally.  One easy-to-identify problem, for example, was wasteful procurement practices such as failing to secure bulk discounts on printers.  But Birgeneau apparently has no concept of savings:  even in procuring a consulting firm, he failed to receive proposals from other firms.
Students, staff, faculty, and California legislators are the victims of his incompetence.   Now that sports teams are feeling the pinch, perhaps the California Alumni Association, benefactors and donators, and the UC Board of Regents will demand to know why Birgeneau is raking in $500,000 a year despite the abdication of his responsibilities.
The author, who has 35 years’ consulting experience, has taught at University of California Berkeley, where he was able to observe the culture and the way the senior management operates.

The word “relief” was a common refrain when the No. 2 USC men’s water polo team (16-2) reviewed last Sunday’s hard-fought victory against UC Santa Barbara. Able to quash its losing streak at a modest two games, the Trojans set out anew Saturday, hoping to begin their next winning streak. The team will host No. 7 Pacific (12-6) at 2 p.m., followed by a quick turnaround nonconference game against Concordia (9-9) at 3:30 p.m. in the same afternoon.
Ready to fire · Sophomore driver Michael Rosenthal looks to take a shot against Long Beach State. The Trojans will face No. 7 Pacific on Friday. - Courtney Sandlin | Daily Trojan 
Although No. 3 UCLA looms on the horizon, USC coach Jovan Vavic and his players know better than to overlook a talented Pacific team. After all, the Trojans might have been guilty of overlooking Stanford when anticipating the upcoming game against then-No. 2 Cal. As is well-known at this point, the Trojans wound up losing both games.
“We always take it one game at a time,” said sophomore driver Michael Rosenthal. “Especially with the two losses we have this season, we know that every single game is important. It’s not just about winning but also about improving every week.”
Vavic also summarily dismissed the notion that his players might overlook these two teams.
“I’m not even thinking about UCLA right now,” Vavic said. “Pacific is a very, very dangerous team. They have strong two-meter players, great outside shooting and a very good goalie.”
Concordia does not pose as much of a threat to the heavyweight Trojans. But as with any underdog, if Concordia is imbued with the sense early that it can win the game, it might just hang in long enough to steal a win.
“Concordia has a pretty good team,” said junior goalie Joel Dennerley. “They have a lot of experienced older guys who we’re looking out for, as well as several dangerous shooters.”
One issue Vavic has addressed in this week’s practices is his team’s relative silence when playing. The always vociferous and animated coach expressed a concern that his team’s defense is not communicating well enough, leading to some occasional breakdowns in coverage.
“We have a very quiet team and that’s their nature,” Vavic said. “Many of our guys are just not very vocal, and that’s not good for your defense. You need to yell and communicate to your teammates.”
Ultimately, the Trojans will have the superior talent in the pool this weekend. But mental lapses and an inability to execute could be the determining factors between a win and a loss.
If the team’s win against UC Santa Barbara is any indication, the Trojans will take nothing for granted this weekend.

Podcast: Sports editors James Bianchi and Kenny Legan discuss the most important game of the Trojans’ season.
The No. 24 Trojans, so accustomed in recent years to being the favorite when playing at the Coliseum, will find themselves in a new role Saturday — the underdog.
Poised · Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley, seen taking a snap against Stanford, will need to provide some offense of his own if the Trojans want to keep up with the high-powered Oregon offense. The last time the teams met the Ducks won 47-20. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (5-2) host top-ranked Oregon in a prime time 5 p.m. matchup that will be aired nationally on ABC.
ESPN’s College GameDay will be on campus, and the eyes of the nation will tune in to see if a No. 1 team loses for the fourth straight week.
Surprisingly, USC will not be the team looking to avoid a fall but rather the one looking to do the tripping. Saturday marks the first time the Trojans have faced a No. 1 team since 1992, and the first time one has visited the Coliseum since 1988.
But confidence is present in the Trojan camp.
“We definitely have the capability of beating Oregon,” sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley said.
Some of the Trojans’ bravado likely stems from their 48-14 drubbing of Cal two weeks ago, which was USC’s first complete game on both sides of the ball this season.
USC has had a bye week since then, giving it extra time to prepare for the Ducks’ aptly named “blur offense.”
Barkley said the key to the game would be the turnover battle, emphasizing that when he is in control, USC’s offense needs to protect the ball.
That is not a bad idea, considering the Ducks (7-0) lead the nation in turnover margin.
But it was not that statistic that vaulted Oregon to the top of the national polls. Rather, it was its offense, which is playing at a tempo almost unheard of in college football and scoring a ton of points while doing so.
The Ducks run one play after another at a breakneck pace. On average, the time between their plays is about 23.2 seconds, almost 32 percent faster than the national average. Oregon makes its living on tiring out opposing defenses, which means the Trojans expect to substitute more.
“We’re going to try to play more guys than normal,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “We’re going to need some people who maybe haven’t played that much or made significant plays to step up for us. We can’t leave our main guys out there the whole time. [The Ducks] just play too fast.”
Oregon has torched opponents for 55.8 points per game and averages 569 yards per game. It will be up to the Trojans’ defense to slow the Ducks’ attack enough to keep the score close.
Freshman cornerback Nickell Robey said USC’s success will be determined by how well it can translate what the players have worked on in practice into the game Saturday.
“Coming into this game, you just got to pretty much have a plan, and just go to that plan and execute,” Robey said.
A bye week came at a good time for the injured Trojans, who could see multiple players return from ailments, including senior linebacker Malcolm Smith, redshirt sophomore defensive end Wes Horton and freshman tailback Dillon Baxter.
Yet, others remain questionable. Redshirt sophomore defensive end Nick Perry and junior offensive tackle Tyron Smith continue to battle ankle injuries.
Whatever hype surrounds this game, that amount would surely be multiplied if the Trojans had not lost on last-second field goals to Washington and Stanford. Otherwise, the Trojans would be undefeated and among the nation’s top-rated teams.
So do the Trojans need this game to get back on the national radar?
“I don’t think [a win] puts us on the map,” Kiffin said. “’SC’s been on the map for a long time and it will continue to be.”
Kif, don’t be afraid to call a time out to give the defense a break.

The Los Angeles Department of Public Health was on campus providing influenza, pertussis (whooping cough) and pneumococcal (pneumonia) vaccinations by the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Thursday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Although the flu shot commonly causes soreness, redness or swelling where the shot was given, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone who can get a flu shot, especially those often around children or over the age of 65.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, “Each year, the seasonal influenza vaccine contains three influenza viruses – one influenza A (H3N2) virus, one influenza A (H1N1) virus, and one influenza B virus. The 2009 H1N1 influenza virus strain is included in the 2010-11 seasonal flu vaccine because scientists continue to see this virus strain circulate in the U.S.”
Whooping cough vaccines were recommended because California is currently experiencing a whooping cough epidemic. The California Department of Public Health reported Tuesday that there have been 6,257 confirmed, probable and suspect cases of whooping cough with onset from Jan. 1 through Oct. 19, for a state rate of 16 cases per 100,000 people.
The report said that was the most cases reported in 60 years.
Pneumonia is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable deaths in the United States, and is recommended for those aged 19-64 who smoke or have chronic or immunosuppressing medical conditions like asthma.
Healthy young adults feel less need to protect themselves through vaccination, but even healthy people are hospitalized each year from these diseases. Get immunized – it’s so much safer and easier than getting infected.

Controversy hits high gear
A few days ago I was biking from my home on Ellendale Place to class. As a student that is well aware of  — but has not received — the infamous $300 tickets the Los Angeles Police Department gives out on the corner of Jefferson and McClintock Avenue for riding bicycles against traffic or through the crosswalk during red lights when pedestrians are crossing, I generally try to do things the right way.
As such, I was offended and appalled at the baseless and harassing “traffic stop” made by Department of Public Safety Officer Johnathan Clayton as I crossed Jefferson Boulevard onto campus earlier in the week.
When crossing Jefferson on my approach from Hoover Street, I specifically waited for a green light to the traffic on Hoover before riding my bicycle across the street with traffic, rather than risking an outrageous ticket by riding my bike through the crosswalk with the pedestrian signals.
As I was riding my bicycle across the street with traffic, a DPS vehicle pulled up next to me, and to my surprise, an officer yelled something to the effect of, “What do you think you’re doing? Meet me at the stop sign in front of the Lyon Center.”
When I met the officer at this stop sign he proceeded to tell me that, pursuant to California Vehicle Code, what I did was illegal because I biked across the street while the “red hand” pedestrian signal was displayed. At this intersection, a “red hand” pedestrian signal is always displayed when there is a green light to traffic on Hoover.
I respectfully attempted to explain to the officer that under California Vehicle Code a bicycle is considered a vehicle, has all the rights of a vehicle, and that I was biking with traffic and following the green light — a vehicle signal (California Vehicle Code 21200).
To this the officer said that, because the bicycle lane ends at that intersection, a bicyclist could no longer cross the street along with traffic.
Not only is this completely contrary to Code 21200, but the statement also is in direct opposition to 21208, which states that when a bicycle lane has been established, a bicycle is explicitly permitted to move out of the bicycle lane when approaching a place where a right turn is authorized.
Thus, in my situation, I was not only not prohibited from, but explicitly authorized by California Vehicle Code to ride my bicycle in the lane with automobile traffic.
After being harassed by Clayton for approximately 10 minutes into finally stating that I agreed with his skewed understanding of California Vehicle Code. I wanted to get on with my life and avoid having to spend time and energy defending myself against the $300 ticket he threatened to write (even though I was confident I would win) the final part of this interaction was the icing on the cake.
He actually encouraged me to break the law by telling me to next time wait for the pedestrian signal and bike through the crosswalk with it — but just to be careful, because LAPD will hand out a $300 ticket, even though DPS will not.
DPS and Officer Clayton, I realize you might have the best intentions, but good intentions are no excuse for the continued harassment and unfounded stops of bicyclists by DPS officers on and around campus.
With the sheer volume of bicycles at USC, it seems well past due for DPS to thoroughly train its officers on California Vehicle Code as it relates to bicycles.
Aaron Perman
Senior, business administration
There is no right hand curb in the middle of an intersection and code 21208 clearly exempts one from the requirement to ride to the right next to the curb when cars are making a right turn (which they were at the intersection).
I did a hand signal that I was moving lanes when I got to the intersection. I do not recall if the Officer was at the intersection yet when I gave the signal. 
Saying I almost struck the DPS vehicle is ridiculous. When he called out to me I moved toward the DPS vehicle so I could hear Officer Clayton, but at no point was I within “striking distance” of the vehicle and at no point did the officer say anything related to almost striking his vehicle or this being a safety hazard. If it looked like there was almost an accident, from what I remember (and this was last week) the officer came up behind me – so if anyone almost hit anyone, it was Officer Clayton almost hitting me where there was not room to safely pass. 
Officer Clayton’s entire speech to me did not say one word about an accident almost being caused or a safety issue but rather centered on California Vehicle Code and his “fact” that a bicycle was not a vehicle and was not allowed to cross the street with traffic at a green light because there wasn’t specifically a bike lane in the intersection. He clarified this as “the law” multiple times and it is factually incorrect. 
And I do apologize for the error on the streets – like I said, I didn’t have time to fight the ticket and barely had time to write this, it was Jefferson and McClintock.
You have a great point Aaron however, you should read the sub-section also which clearly you did not. Reading the response to your article shows that DPS is thoroughly trained on the California Vehicle Code as it relates to bicycles.
I saw this and this article what you’re saying this officer said is not what took place at all. First off, the intersection was Jefferson and McClintock and not Jefferson and Hoover. When you biked across the intersection you almost struck the DPS vehicle which is what he was trying to explain to you. Per CVC section 21202 (a) it states, Any person operating a bicycle upon a roadway at a speed less than the normal speed of traffic moving in the same direction at that time shall ride as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway. What you need to understand is you were biking at a speed less than the normal speed of traffic and per this section you are REQUIRED to ride as practicable to the right-hand curb as possible. If you would have done that you would have not come close to the DPS vehicle. 
In addition, CVC section 21208 (b) states “No person operating a bicycle shall leave a bicycle lane until the movement can be made with reasonable safety and then only after giving an appropriate signal in the manner provided in Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 22100) in the event that any vehicle may be affected by the movement”. It was evident that it was not safe to leave the bicycle lane at that point nor did you give the appropriate signal to leave the bicycle lane, which ends at the intersection of Jefferson and McClintock.
I assumed that the DPS officer would stop you because your careless bicycling almost cause an accident between you and him and I myself stopped to listen to the education of the California Vehicle Code he tried to provide you with. He tried over and over to explain to you what the difference was between your version of the CVC and what the actual version is. Not only did you continue to interrupt him, you then wrote this article which is entirely untrue of what occurred that afternoon. 
Officer Clayton did not encourage you to break any laws. His words were, “Do you see the people biking in the intersection now?, that’s a huge ticket. When we see the students breaking vehicle code violations DPS would rather educate the students than to write tickets unlike LAPD”. Furthermore, from a outside person looking in, it looked as if he wanted to move on with his life more so than you with yours!
I am writing this article because I was applaud about what I read and it was entirely untrue. DPS always takes the bad wrap but in actuality we as students can be the problem. Imagine if they did give us tickets instead of educate us, imagine if they did take us to jail for being drunk in public instead of getting us medical aid or giving us rides home. Before you write a article that is an direct attack at DPS or one of their officers, first let it be factual and then think of all the crap 90% of our student population put them through on top of the everyday law enforcement problems they have to deal with.

On Tuesday, California voters will have the opportunity to legalize the use of marijuana.
But even if Proposition 19 passes, don’t go busting out the bongs and joints just yet.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
The substance is still outlawed by the federal government, and multiple officials have vowed to enforce federal law as it pertains to illicit substance abuse, meaning the proposition will still encounter a significant amount of resistance.
“[Proposition] 19 has no effect on what we’re going to do,” said Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca in a news conference. He said that he and the officers he is in charge of wouldn’t change their enforcement policy on the drug; they will still recognize and enact its prohibition, according to the Los Angeles Times.
U.S. Attorney Gen. Eric Holder shares the same resolve.
“We will vigorously enforce the [Controlled Substances Act] against those individuals and organizations that possess, manufacture or distribute marijuana for recreational use, even if such activities are permitted under state law,” he stated in a letter to former official at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
Granted, the policing ability of the federal government is limited by its manpower, but the commitment of the state and municipalities to uphold federal law indirectly supplements and fulfills Holder’s guarantee.
All of which lends itself to the conclusion that, even if the proposition is passed, marijuana could remain illegal in California — at least for the time being — because federal law supersedes state law.
In all fairness, passage of the measure is by no means futile or meaningless. If nothing else, it’s a step in the direction of nationwide legalization, which many people view as a question of not “if,” but “when.”
To borrow a concept from Louis Brandeis, passing Proposition 19 would set California up as a “laboratory of democracy” — an instigator of even more political reform, the theory being that other states will follow in our footsteps to the point that external pressure forces a review of federal policy, similar to the repeal of Prohibition.
But even if the passage of Proposition 19 does prompt other states to follow suit, it will likely be years before they catch up to California. So far, only 14 states have legalized medical marijuana; the rest still have to overcome that barrier before they can even entertain the idea of marijuana being fully legalized.
Many Californians seem to be under the impression that Proposition 19 will grant them immediate and unfettered access to marijuana, but that simply is not the case.
Supporters of Proposition 19, especially the younger ones, still seem unaware of that.
Proposition 19 is a milestone to be celebrated by some, but by no means is it a final destination on either side of the issue. For those of you who are going to rally to the polls to show your support, be sure to arrive understanding the whole story.

I thought the “joint effort” title was clever.  Humor never negates the seriousness of an issue.  In fact it could be the hook that draws an otherwise non-reader into into a discussion about a serious subject that they might not have engaged without it (humor that is).  Maybe the readership should grow up and not the author of this article.  Good work Reid…. Keep the humor and thought provoking articles coming!
Okay, can we have a serious discussion about cannabis legalization without busting out the horrible “pothead puns”?  “Not a JOINT effort,” “LIGHTS UP new ideas,” please grow up.  I’m really tired of treating Prop 19 like some kind of a big joke.  Prop 19 deals with, potentially, billions of dollars in tax revenues and is one of the most important laws in terms of expanding civil liberties that we have seen in the US in a long time.  In fact, in the past decade, this may be one of the only laws that expands rather than restricts civil liberties (hello, Patriot Act).
I understand that headlines are supposed to grab attention, but if the media (yes, DT, you are part of “the media”) doesn’t treat it seriously, how can we expect the voters to take it seriously.  Understand that what you write affects people, so please try to take important subjects like this election seriously.  Would you ever have written “LGBT Community Not Gay Over Prop 8”?  Get it?  Because “gay” means happy as well as homosexual.  Funny stuff, right?  Oh, wait, no it’s really not.
Lee Baca is an idiot.  I will love to see him take someone to state court under federal marijuana charges and get shot down by the judge.  Unless, of course, he wants to take someone to a district judge for possessing 1/8 of an ounce of marijuana…and then get shot down by the district judge for wasting everyone’s time.
Prop 19, if it passes, will allow people to smoke in the privacy of their homes without police harassment, and if Lee Baca wants to challenge that he’s going to lose in the California courts, because Prop 19, not federal laws, are what they will enforce.
This law, when passed, will probably go to the Supreme Court, where the justices will decide that Proposition 19 is legal under the commerce clause, because the federal government is not allowed to regulate the use of various drugs within a given state.  Therefore, Proposition 19 could spell the legalization of marijuana nationwide.
It will be very interesting if this gets to the Supreme Court because it will force the conservative justices to vote either on principle or on their social beliefs.  Thomas will probably vote on principle, Scalia is could vote either way, though.  Roberts and Alito are too young to tell.  Kennedy…well no one ever knows what Kennedy will do.

As excitement and anticipation for President Barack Obama’s presence at the Democratic rally last week was rising, I could not help but notice how many USC students seemed to be badmouthing our president.
A large number of Republicans comprise the student body at USC, and understandably so, as our student body is made up of students from all backgrounds and from across the country.
But it seems that, instead of just the usual hard-liners, an increasingly diverse range of people do not approve of Obama’s performance in office thus far.
In fact, Obama’s approval rating among college students has dropped to a meager 44 percent, down from 60 percent in May 2009, according to an AP-MTV poll.
The American people — conservatives and liberals alike — seem to possess a litany of inaccurate assumptions about Obama’s time in office thus far.
Some believe he raised taxes, which hurt the economy.
This is false — Obama lowered taxes for 95 percent of working families in the United States through a provision in the stimulus bill. In fact, the tax cuts detracted from the impact of the stimulus.
Some think Obama bailed out the banks. This is also untrue.
Former President George W. Bush and his treasury secretary, former Goldman Sachs CEO Robert Paulson, requested the bailouts while Bush was still in office. The bailouts passed and began to take effect before the 2008 elections.
Others believe Obama’s healthcare reform cost our nation $1 trillion and will bankrupt us.
The truth is, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the overhauled healthcare policy will lower the deficit by $138 billion.
Finally, many people think that Obama has not actually helped our economy.
Unemployment was already very steadily on the rise when the transition from the Bush administration was taking place, but the main thing to consider is that Obama’s stimulus package raised employment by between 1.4 million and 3.3 million jobs, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
These myths — often combined with insignificant but numerous criticisms of Obama’s lifestyle — seem to be the main reasons behind Obama’s recent drop in popularity.
While discussing Obama’s administration with a few friends, for instance, the story of Michelle Obama taking an overseas vacation was brought up.
I had originally mentioned the trip to defend Obama’s foreign policy decisions, but instead Obama was criticized for allowing his wife to spend government money on a vacation.
They felt that if she wanted to take a vacation, at least she could have done it in the United States.
Rather than focusing on actual legislation, students and the media alike are emphasizing trivial mishaps in the White House.
In fact, Obama should be getting a lot more credit for his accomplishments in office.
Since his inauguration in 2009, Obama has fought tirelessly to push legislation while being constantly obstructed by partisan politics.
In addition to passing the most ambitious reform agenda since the New Deal — healthcare reform — Obama has successfully implemented financial reform as well.
Lastly, thanks to the administration’s work, the nation’s underprivileged finally can look forward to decent access to healthcare.
Obama and his administration might not have accomplished everything they had intended by this time, but that is to be expected.
Our country cannot afford to make its political decisions based on sensationalism.
It’s time to recognize Obama for the impressive range of goals he has already achieved.
Gokul Agrawal is a junior majoring in business administration.
Obama’s “impressive range of goals” are why Democrats are about to get a severe lashing.  
“Students” were mentioned for some reason (is academic uni-thot really that bad?).  What about everyone else? Are you claiming their growing opposition to Obamagenda is unwarranted?
Why do I care that “Obama lowered taxes for 95 percent of working families in the United States through a provision in the stimulus bill”? He’s doing everything in his power to raise them for my parents.
Just because you disagree with something does not mean that it is “unwarranted.” I dislike Obama precisely because of the legislation that he has supported and the intended outcome of his efforts. I wake up every morning and hope that he fails in his attempts to alter our country.
And guess what. Trivial mishaps count. And I hold Obama accountable for every one of his, as I did Bush and as I do every other politician.
Voting for B. Hussein Obama was the hip thing to do, but that was so 2008.   I’m focusing on the Mary J prop now.
Who should USC students believe? You, or their lying eyes?
How much “cool aid” did you drink before writing this piece?
You got president currently, who wears rose colored glasses, but doesn’t know how to execute in pragmatic ways. The idealism and his prose tone in speeches is something that makes me more cynical.
Most of the “facts” stated in this article are entirely wrong and easily disputed. Where did you pull them from, the White House website? Do you think your readers are stupid?
“Some believe he raised taxes.” He sure as hell did, with the passage of Obamacare alone. How do you think this is going to be paid for?
“Some believe he bailed out the banks.” He bailed out everyone but the banks!
“Others believe healthcare will bankrupt us.” Yeah, you might actually spend ten minutes researching this instead of quoting the an OLD report from the CBO. 
“Many think Obama has not actually helped our economy.” Now, I cannot IMAGINE why anyone would think this! I mean, just look around — we had recovery summer, and now everything’s peachy! And by the way, NOBODY believes that bogus “we saved or created jobs” crap. We know all about government census workers (who are now unemployed again anyway). Have you seen the unemployment figures, Gokul? Are you wearing blinders?
Remember that analogy that Obama has beaten to death about the car being driven into the ditch? Well, there are a lot of questions about how it got there in the first place. But he hasn’t budget that car one inch — in fact, he’s pushed it so far into the mud that we might never be able to get it out.
I think it’s ironic that Democrats tacitly agree that overspending led to this problem, but then insist that VASTLY overspending will solve it. How’s that working for us? Good GRIEF, Gokul, WAKE UP. He’s not your savior.
This is what happens when we vote on emotion. Would USC hire a president that had only two years of experience running a Junior College in Illinois? I don’t think so. It is obvious that this man was not ready to take on this office. Even though I voted for Bush I did not agree with everything he did but at some point we are going to have to stop using his name in every negative article regarding Obama. It’s about time he started taking responsibility for his actions and lack of experience.
Everything that Bush did, Obama could undo, but did not. The healthcare package was so large and so rushed through, without keeping the campaign promises, that it cannot be considered a positive. What good is passing a half-baked law through Congress? It has provisions for 99 new review boards – a political patronage scheme. Additional boards may be created without new laws passed. I guess if you are a student planning to go into the government sector it might be a reason to stay positive about the president, but most students aren’t looking for government paychecks for their entire career. Perhaps your next article could outline the promises that have been kept. The perception throughout the country is that he made promises and then focused on an entirely different agenda.

Nationwide college tuition costs have continued to rise this fall and students are relying more on federal aid, according to two recent College Board reports.
Public four-year schools, many of which have suffered at the hands of state budget cuts, have seen their average in-state tuition and fees this fall rise 7.9 percent, $555, to $7,605. The average cost of attendance at private schools has increased 4.5 percent, $1,164, to $27,293.
As the cost of attending college rises, expanded federal aid is helping to keep the cost in check for many students. Tax credits, veterans’ benefits and a record expansion of the Pell Grant program for low-income students – an increase of almost $10 billion from the year before – are able to moderately hold down the net tuition and fees.

For those that still don’t know what USoC stands for (and, no, it’s not simply USC with an extra letter in it), get ready to laugh.
Founded just last year, the Uncensored Students of Comedy group is gaining momentum as well as a growing community of supporters at USC.
Last night at Ground Zero, the student-run stand-up comedy group gathered for another night of jokes, smiles and outright goofiness.  Junior Emin Vartanians opened for and hosted the event.  The line-up included Natalie Semotiuk, Kyle Mizono, founder Jennifer Rendel, Chris Connelly and Allison Raskin.
Some of the biggest laughs from the audience came during Connelly’s set with his powerful one-liners.  Mizono’s hilariously deadpan persona and Raskin’s slightly spastic demeanor also evoked several laughs.
USoC’s shows are usually held in Taper Hall, and its online schedule can be found on its Facebook page.  The next show takes place Nov. 18.
Though the group is still fairly new to campus, its goals are clear: to make students laugh.  And that’s exactly what it did.

Over the last couple weeks, the movement to “Red Out” the Coliseum has gained steam, as Trojan fans try to rally support for Homecoming weekend by encouraging attendees of Saturday’s Oregon game to wear cardinal shirts.
But with ESPN’s College GameDay program in town on Saturday, Ducks fans will not back down quietly. A rival grassroots movement to “Green Out” GameDay and the Coliseum has sprouted in order to “show [USC] that [Oregon] has the best fans in the nation,” according to the creator of the movement Alex Horwitch, an Oregon student and president of the “Pit Crew,” the Oregon student section.
“I bet that the Oregon Duck football fans can have the best showing of any away team during the taping of College GameDay in the history of the show!” Horwitch wrote to The Oregonian.
The primary goal of the “Green Out” is to bring the “Autzen advantage” down to the Coliseum. Autzen Stadium in Oregon is known for being one of the toughest places to play and had an electric atmosphere last year for Oregon’s Halloween 47-20 romp against the Trojans.
The “Green Out” plan adds yet another facet to an emerging rivalry between the two Pac-10 schools. Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley already made headlines after he tweeted comparing Oregon to fallen UFC champion Brock Lesnar, and the Trojans to the underdog victor Cain Velasquez.
Junior defensive tackle Jurrell Casey, perhaps the Trojans’ best defensive player, called the Ducks “really not that good,” apart from their quarterback and tailback.
All of these factors will be sure to contribute to a chaotic, energetic, red-clad Coliseum crowd on Saturday night.
DustyGoDucks,
Why don’t you go check the US news & world report of university rankings before you tell us to get educated :) 
thanks sweety pie
Alex you used to be a Trojan and your grandfather was on a national championship Trojan team…what happened to you?
ducks are gonna kill it, and horwitch is a genius.  i can not wait to see the headlines after oregon crushes USC.
Alex Horwitch is a spirited genius.
Casey clearly hasn’t watched any Ducks game this year, or last year, for that matter.
Barkley has it mixed up because USC used to be the best and now we’ve taken their crown.
Go suck a nut and get educated you damn crybabies.
“really not that good” apart from their quarterback and tailback. who together are better than all of USC combined. and the rest of the team is way better than USC too. so, apparently he hasn’t been watching UofO destroy everyone they’ve played so far.
P.S. Alex Horwitch is a badass.
Really not that good? That’s why score nearly a point a minute?

The Trojans want to be at full strength when they play No. 1 Oregon on Saturday, but with the game only days away, the injury news is still mixed.
He’s back · Freshman running back Dillon Baxter, who sprained his toes at Stanford, returned to practice Wednesday for the time in two weeks. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
On the positive side, freshman running back Dillon Baxter practiced Wednesday for the first time in weeks. Baxter sprained multiple toes on his left foot against Stanford, forcing him to miss the Cal game.
Baxter looked quick on the practice field, but said he is only at 90 percent.
However, Baxter said he was further along than he anticipated and said he expects to play against the Ducks.
Senior linebacker Malcolm Smith, who had been battling a knee injury he suffered against Stanford, also returned to practice, although his action was limited.
Redshirt sophomore defensive end Wes Horton was not named at all in the injury report, which is good news considering Horton has battled a nagging back injury he suffered during the Washington State game a month ago. Horton was limited in practice last week and only participated in full practice this week.
Meanwhile, redshirt sophomore defensive end Nick Perry and junior offensive tackle Tyron Smith did not practice. Both have ankle injuries.
Despite Perry and Smith’s absence, the Trojans appear to be as close to full strength as they have been in a while. Health and extra time for preparation have been the two biggest keys to the Trojans’ off-week, USC coach Lane Kiffin said.
“Because of the uniqueness of the opponent that we’re playing, I think it’s helped,” Kiffin said. “Especially because of that and because of where our health was, if we can get those guys back, those are two big things.”
—
From an offensive standpoint, much has been made about scoring points and taking care of the ball as USC prepares for the Ducks. To do that, the Trojans’ offensive line must be quick at picking up blitzes.
Much of the onus will fall on senior center Kristofer O’Dowd, who is responsible for changing the protection to adjust to blitzes.
“He’s extremely important,” Kiffin said. “There’s so many different fronts and the fronts change at all times, and a lot of the fronts dictate what you do.”
Kiffin said that freshman receiver Robert Woods’  61-yard touchdown catch against Stanford was possible because O’Dowd recognized a blitz and changed the protection just in time.
—
Linebackers coach Joe Barry is responsible for relaying the defensive calls from defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin in the booth to the defense on the field. Playing against Oregon’s “blur” offense will make his job that much more difficult this week.
“It changes everything, no question,” Barry said. “The entire tempo of this game changes….We’re just going to have to be a hell of a lot faster,” Barry said.
—
Freshman wide receiver Markeith Ambles was suspended indefinitely Tuesday. Kiffin gave some insight into how Ambles and redshirt freshman linebacker Simione Vehikite, who is also serving a suspension, need to change their behavior.
“We have extremely high standards for our players that we expect as student athletes,” Kiffin said. “And Markeith wasn’t meeting those.”
Although the report that came out Tuesday stated the suspension was because of tardiness, Kiffin implied the suspensions were academic in nature. He said help from tutors is made available to the suspended players.
“If you’re not going to come here and be a student, then go somewhere else,” Kiffin said. “Your hope is that it serves as a wake-up call.”
I was just wondering who’s the newspaper’s editor. There have been a couple of times that I have found a typo in the hardcopy you guys put out every day. This article’s picture (from the hardcopy) description: “Freshman running back Dillon Baxter who sprained his toes at Stanford, returned Wednesday for the (FIRST)  time in two weeks”.

In sports circles everywhere, it’s widely known that defense wins championships.
The problem for USC is that there is no championship to be won, and the defense has played that way for a large part of this season.
Sure, the Trojans’ defense is coming off its most dominating performance yet, strangling a Cal team that throttled UCLA the week before, holding the Bears to no first downs through the first quarter and just 14 points for the game.
But that was a diamond in what has been a rough season for Monte Kiffin and Ed Orgeron’s defense — the secondary especially — which is why the result of this game against Associated Press No. 1 Oregon, USC’s bowl game as it’s been dubbed, is up to sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley and his troops.
Oregon has come up against some stiff defense this year. The Stanford defense forced two turnovers en route to a 21-3 first quarter lead, and it looked like the Cardinal was on its way to upsetting the Ducks. However, thanks in large part to the Oregon defense holding Stanford scoreless the entire second half, the offense was able to work its spread 3-D offense and come back for the win.
Then there was Arizona State and one of the hardest hitting linebackers in the game, Vontaze Burfict. The Sun Devils forced the Ducks to punt an astonishing 11 times and held them to their smallest point total of the year at 42. Yet, Oregon still won by a comfortable 11 points because the Arizona State offense turned the ball over seven times.
So even if the Trojans defense does get stops and force turnovers Saturday, that’s not a guaranteed formula for success. Obviously it will help the Trojans if the defense steps up and causes a few early turnovers the offense can capitalize on. This would be a change from last year’s match when the Trojans got a few scores down early and had to play catch-up, which failed disastrously.
The point remains that even if the Trojans do get a few stops, it’s inevitable the Oregon offense will get its points much like Scooby-Doo eventually gets his Scooby snacks. For an offense that leads the nation with an average of 55.1 points through seven games, it’s apparent that nobody is going to stop them.
Thus if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em. Even though Stanford went up big on Oregon, and Arizona State made the Ducks punt 11 times, both offenses eventually stalled — Stanford didn’t score the entire second half and Arizona State didn’t score in the fourth quarter — which allowed the Ducks to stay calm, get back in the game and eventually take it over.
This can’t happen against USC. I’m not saying that Barkley, senior running back Allen Bradford or the explosive wide receiving/kick returning duo of senior Ronald Johnson and freshman Robert Woods need to score every time; the Trojans could probably get away with punting once.
The more USC can score and continue scoring throughout the game, the more it will put pressure on the Ducks and put them in a situation they have not been in yet this year — trailing in the fourth quarter. As we’ve seen in the last three weeks, when a No. 1 team finds itself in a tight contest late in the game, it has choked and faltered.
It’s not like this is an unreasonable request from the offense. Asking it to don kilts and walk around Chinatown as a mariachi band would be unreasonable. The Trojans have scored 48, 49 and 50 points in games this year, almost all coming solely from the offense. Barkley shredded Cal for five first-half touchdowns last game, bringing his total to 20 on the year, which is fourth in the nation. Those five touchdown passes were part of a stretch where the Trojans scored six touchdowns in seven possessions.
That’s the kind of production the offense needs throughout the game to beat the Ducks. With Bradford, redshirt junior running back Marc Tyler and freshman sensation Dillon Baxter — who said he will play this weekend despite a nagging toe injury that’s kept him out of practice the last two weeks — running the ball, the Trojans not only have a dynamic passing attack, but a versatile and fast rushing presence.
If the offense can score with Oregon, which it’s capable of doing, and not turn the ball over, which it has only done three times in the last three games, the Trojans have a good chance of sending the top-ranked team in the nation home losers for the fourth time in as many weeks.
You can also bet they haven’t forgotten about the humiliating 47-20 drubbing in Eugene on Halloween last year. ESPN’s College GameDay was at that game last year, and it will be at USC on Saturday, but the Trojans have the tools to ensure this game has a different outcome.
For Oregon, that’s a scary thought.

Clarification: 10/28/10: Oregon is the number one ranked team according to the Associated Press rankings. The Ducks are the second-ranked team in the Bowl Championship Series ranking for the week of October 24th.
FIGHT ON!!! BEAT THE DUCKS!!!

For the members of the newly formed USC surf team, Tuesday presented a unique opportunity.
Nice to meet you · The USC Surf team met with surfer Jamie O’Brien and mingled at the Red Bull Headquarters Tuesday as part of an event previewing the surfer’s new movie. O’Brien won the prestigious Pipeline Masters title in 2004 as a 21-year-old wildcard entry. - Photo courtesy of Emma Wood 
After attending a screening of star surfer Jaime O’Brien’s new movie, Who is J.O.B?, the team was able to meet O’Brien and talk shop.
“It was cool to talk to an athlete like that who’s performing on a different level,” said Mark Lathrum, a senior majoring in business administration. “It was definitely good for our surf team to see that.”
But meeting a top surfer meant something more to a team striving to make a name for itself.
“Basically, this helps our publicity a lot. Everyone here is a surfer or a skater or an extreme sport athlete,” said Mariah Gill, a junior majoring in environmental studies. “The surf team, especially the competitive part of it, fuels itself off of sponsors and things like that.”
As of now, the team seems like it can only rise in recognition and rankings. Its sponsors include ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Sporting-Sails by Sukrafte, Wellen Surf and Bubble Gum Surf Wax — and more seem to be on the way. Just this week, the team received $1,000 from an anonymous donor.
But Lathrum stressed that this event wasn’t just for networking. It also gave the team members an opportunity to present themselves as a unit, he said, and take time to relax and have fun with their fellow competitors.
The team also used this time to reach out to other Southern California surf teams, including groups from Cal State Long Beach and UCLA.
“We all have really busy schedules, and most of the time we’re in competitive mode. It’s nice to be somewhere where we can have a little fun and be together at night. We were in an environment that we were very comfortable in — with other surfers,” Lathrum said.
The invite to the event means a lot for the new Trojan surf team, which just began its journey last year after a two-year hiatus. Lathrum, along with Jena Sussex and John Funnell, both juniors majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, started the team with the intention of being able to give one of the biggest schools in Southern California an actual surf team.
“We’re the University of Southern California — just the fact that we have that name and we didn’t even have a surf team here was something I thought we needed to change,” Lathrum said. “I knew a handful of guys that surfed from my close friends, so I started from there. There had to be a bunch of people out there who were excited to compete and have people around them to surf, and after the first day we had about a solid four.”
What started out as a group of four has grown into a group that is split into a club and a team — members of the club surf recreationally, while the team is more competitive. There are about 15 core surfers on the team who compete on a regular basis.
“It’s just a different level of competitiveness,” Lathrum said. “Each one is just as fun as the other — it’s just a matter of what level you want to be in.”
The club’s cohesion can be attributed to one basic thing, Gill said.
“Everyone likes to surf and we all like to be in the water,” she said.
