USC has won 46 of its last 48 home games.
It’s a well-known stat — one that dates back all the way to September 2001.

It’s equally well-known that the only miscues in between have come at the hands of the Stanford Cardinal.
Stanford beat the Trojans twice at home during that time — once in 2001 and once in 2007, which was the fateful 24-23 upset that shocked the college football world.
And now, fittingly enough, No. 9 USC (7-2) must face the Cardinal again Saturday in a Homecoming game that could prove instrumental to determining the Pac-10 champion.
And after a 51-42 win over Oregon on Saturday, No. 25 Stanford (6-3) made an appearance in the Associated Press Top 25 Poll this week for the first time since 2001.
“The fact is that it’s a huge opportunity in the conference for us,” USC coach Pete Carroll said at his Tuesday press conference. “It’s Homecoming. They’re coming off an enormous win. This is a great, great matchup for us.”
The pieces are coming together for the Trojans: a month-long homestand to end the season, starters at fullback and tight end returning, and a bye week to follow.
But while redshirt junior fullback Stanley Havili and senior tight end Anthony McCoy are expected to be back, USC will likely have to make do without top receiver redshirt junior Damian Williams, who sprained his ankle last Saturday.
Williams has more than doubled the receptions of any other pass-catcher this season.
And the Cardinal is on the rise. It has consistently outscored opponents this season, 306-221, with their three losses coming by a total of 22 points.
They also boast three key offensive weapons who can all run.
It starts with redshirt freshman quarterback Andrew Luck, the son of former NFL quarterback and would-be Rhodes Scholar Oliver Luck and exactly the kind of cerebral player you’d expect to lead the offense at Stanford.
Luck was the valedictorian of his high school class. He’s thrown just three interceptions in 216 pass attempts this season and completed 58 percent of his passes.
“He’s playing great football and they are showing tremendous confidence in him,” Carroll said of the 19-year-old. “They allow him to throw the ball all over the field.”
Luck threw for two touchdowns and 251 yards on 20 pass attempts in leading the Cardinal to its victory over Oregon. He also rushed the ball five times, including an 11-yard first-down run in the second quarter.
“He’s a big pocket guy, and he’s running well,” Carroll said. “We’re catching him at his very best right now.”
Of course, Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh doesn’t ask his rookie quarterback to do most of the heavy lifting for the Cardinal offense. That duty falls to senior running back Toby Gerhart, who — in generating a significant Heisman campaign — has rushed for a Pac-10 leading 1,217 yards this season.
The 6-foot-1, 235-pound Gerhart fits every definition of a workhorse back, averaging 26 carries a game.
“They have a real obvious core of their offense in Toby Gerhart, just a hammer back there running the football,” Carroll said. “They’ve built their style around his physical nature, and it’s working very well for them.”
And then there’s dynamo receiver Chris Owusu, a 6-foot-2, 201-pound sophomore who returns kicks and serves as the starting flanker for the Cardinal.
“He’s got terrific speed,” Carroll said. “With three [return] touchdowns, he’s got our attention already.”
Owusu is a product of nearby Oaks Christian in Westlake Village, Calif., where he starred alongside USC’s tailback Marc Tyler and cornerback Marshall Jones. He ranks fourth in the nation in kick return average at 33.3 yards per return.
Harbaugh embraced the improvement his Cardinal have shown in his third year at the helm.
“I think there’s no question that everything that’s happened to us as a football team — well we’re almost going on three years now, the great things, the horrible things, the good, the bad, all the hard work by so many people — makes us who we are,” Harbaugh said at his weekly press conference.
And the Cardinal might still be underdogs come Saturday, but a well-played game this time around is not going to be a surprise.
“No, it’s not,” junior running back Joe McKnight said. “Stanford’s a pretty good team. They’ve got good players and a disciplined team, so we have to go out there and play disciplined and hard-nosed with them.”
Major Ownage.
EPIC FAIL
This is going to be a great matchup. Stanford is coming off a win, and I am sure they have confidence. The Trojans have a key weapon in Anthony McCoy back. This matchup will decide the standings in the Pac 10.  I look forward to watching this game.
ontime, the “cardinal” of Stanford stands for cardinal red, not a cardinal bird! Kind of like Harvard Crimson (crimson red).
  Their mascot is actually a tree. Kind of interesting.
As for tomorrow’s game, I am quite anxious to see this game. Stanford has usually given USC some losses at the Coliseum in the past. Gerhart is a very good RB, and Andrew Luck is a very accurate QB.
PLUCK them birds!   GO TROJANS.
[…] What a mess this Pac-1o season is. Neither of the favourites coming into the year – USC and Oregon – have been able to distance themselves from the field. While all that was going on, it was Stanford – picked by many to finish sixth in the league this year – who slowly crept up and put themselves within striking distance. Now, this weekend, the Cardinal get a chance to stake claim to the conference crown. […]

Usually schools schedule a cupcake during Homecoming.
Usually they make sure the cupcake is light (healthy is all the rage these days), loaded with creamy frosting and decorated with some celebratory sprinkles.
Missing piece · Having tight end Anthony McCoy back from injury lessens USC’s chances of getting upended by Stanford at home again. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
Usually, the cupcake is devoured before the main course is served and by the time dessert rolls around, the alumni are left to feast on the remaining crumbs.
But, unless you’ve been stalking Sarah Palin from eastern Russia for the past three months, you know that this season isn’t usual.
USC is in the midst of its longest span of mediocre play since the Diamondbacks last won the World Series and has absolutely no chance of appearing in the BCS title game, even with three games left.
What’s more is that the opponent coming in Saturday is a raspberry cupcake with mayonnaise frosting and thorns for sprinkles — in other words, it’s not a scrumptious treat.
Stanford is coming off a shootout win over Pac-10 leader Oregon, a team that itself was coming off an earth-shattering stomping of the previously unstomp-able Trojans. The Cardinal also won the last time it visited the Coliseum in 2007, when they staged one of the greatest upsets of all-time by beating a 41-point favorite USC.
It’s not inconceivable that Stanford will come in Saturday and beat the “struggling” Trojans again.
Indeed, much of the blame for USC’s lackluster play over the past month has been attributed to the defense and to superhuman freshman quarterback Matt Barkley getting kicked out of the Justice League.
This is rightfully so. The defense, which lost eight starters from last season, has given up 119 points in the last four games and has more holes than the Augusta National Golf Club.
Likewise, while Barkley enjoyed success during his first four games, if you’ve watched him over the past month, you’d agree he looks more uncomfortable. In the last game against an inferior Arizona State squad, Barkley went 7-for-22 for 112 yards in a game neither team looked like they wanted to win.
However, two areas have killed USC more than the defense and Barkley’s average play. They have slid under the radar and USC needs to fix them this weekend if it doesn’t want to be embarrassed by Gerhart and the Trees.
The first area is the running game. Yes, USC has become known as Tailback U for its ability to take a running back and make him into a star. Despite senior Stafon Johnson’s injury, the Trojans still have the talent at the position.
Yet, the running game has stalled more than a kid learning to drive stick-shift. USC has averaged only 158.5 yards and 1.25 touchdowns per game on the ground over the past month, while it boasted numbers of 208 and 2.6 in the first five games.
It’s the running game that lifted the weight off Barkley’s shoulders. Whenever USC needed a big play, it would turn to Joe McKnight, Johnson, Allen Bradford or Stanley Havili.
Barkley could focus on playing within himself. Like it or not, he took the Kyle Orton approach the first half of the season by playing not to lose the game. He was conservative and it worked.
Now that the running game has stalled, Barkley has tried to lift the burden onto his shoulders, but they aren’t broad enough yet. This is where the second X-factor for USC comes in: senior tight end Anthony McCoy, who’s scheduled to play Saturday.
McCoy has been out virtually since the Notre Dame game (he played, albeit with an injured ankle, against Oregon State), and that’s about when USC started to sputter. His run-blocking and receiving ability have been missed greatly by the Trojans and especially Barkley, who needs McCoy out there. Even though he’s missed almost three games, McCoy is still the third leading receiver on the team, averaging an absurd 23.4 yards per catch.
It’s his big-play ability that has opened up passing lanes for Barkley, and without McCoy, the offense has been lost. The running game can’t find any holes to run through and the tight ends have caught just three passes in the last three games.
It’s obvious that Barkley needs McCoy and McCoy needs Barkley. The senior tight end has already surpassed his receiving yard total from last season, when he was the starting tight end and had a more experienced quarterback.
The Trojans need the running game to get going and get McCoy back on the field if they want to avoid another embarrassing loss.
USC has shown it can win when the defense plays poorly (see Notre Dame) and when Barkley isn’t forced to make plays (see Ohio State). Yet, as it’s shown in the past month, it can barely float when the running game stalls and when McCoy is out.
Those things need to show up if the Trojans want to have their cake and eat it, too.

The No. 21 USC women’s soccer team begins the quest for its second national title in three years Friday when it plays its opening game of the 2009 NCAA Tournament against Oklahoma State in Santa Clara, Calif.
The Women of Troy (12-6-2) and the Cowgirls (15-7-0) are already familiar with each other, having played Sept. 18 in Stillwater, Okla., in a game USC won 1-0.

“It’s always difficult to play a team for a second time in a season, especially one we already beat,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “But I like the matchup we have.”
Oklahoma State comes into the 5:30 p.m. game riding an eight-game winning streak during which it has outscored its opponents 17-3 and posted six shutouts.
“I remember [Oklahoma State] attacked the outsides a lot, and they had a lot of good crossing opportunities,” senior goalkeeper Kristin Olsen said. “We’ve got to limit the chances they have from the outsides and limit their chances on goal.”
Playing in front of Olsen’s net will be Oklahoma State junior forward Annika Niemeier, who leads the Cowgirls with 11 goals on the season.
Senior forward Kasey Langdon, a two-time All-Big 12 honoree, is also a dangerous attacking option for Oklahoma State with five goals on the year.
The Women of Troy will counter with junior midfielder Alyssa Dávila, who leads USC with nine goals and is tied for tops on the team with five assists.
Freshman forward Samantha Johnson, freshman midfielder Courtney Garcia and redshirt senior Marihelen Tomer have all chipped in for USC with four goals each on the season.
The difference-maker for USC could be Olsen, who led the Pac-10 during the regular season with 101 saves and an 83 percent save rate.
“It’s been a luxury to have her since we’ve arrived here,” Khosroshahin said about the starting keeper. “It definitely gives the team a lot more confidence knowing that she’s back there.”
If the Women of Troy defeat Oklahoma State on Friday, they will play the winner of the match between No. 11 Santa Clara (13-6-1) and Michigan State (11-4-4) on Sunday.
USC defeated Santa Clara 2-0 on Sept. 27 on the road, a matchup that got the Women of Troy familiar with the venue for this weekend’s games.
“We’ve been there before, we’re going to stay in the same hotel,” Dávila said. “It helps that we’ve been there.”
Redshirt senior defender Jordan Angeli tops the Broncos with six goals on the year.
Michigan State senior forward Lauren Hill leads the Spartans with 11 goals this season.
The Women of Troy say they are not looking ahead to either the Broncos or Spartans, however, but instead are completely focusing on Oklahoma State.
“Honestly, I don’t let us [look ahead],” Khosroshahin said. “As soon as you look past your opponent, that’s when bad things occur. We’re keeping the focus on what’s ahead and that’s Oklahoma State.”
With a talented yet inexperienced team, USC is not favored to repeat its 2007 success and claim another national title. The Women of Troy are happy, though, to embrace their new role.
“Our bracket’s hard but it’s good. We’re kind of the underdog,” Dávila said. “We really have nothing to lose. We’re playing good teams and we’re just going to go for it.”

Despite the myriad challenges the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team has faced — and, for the most part, overcome — this season, Saturday’s game against No. 3 Stanford at McDonald’s Swim Stadium may prove to be its biggest yet.
Stanford, which enters the weekend at 19-1 and 6-0 in the conference, hasn’t lost since Oct. 11, and has been ranked in the top three nationally the entire season. The Cardinal won both the Navy and the NorCal tournaments at the beginning of the season, and during that time held the No. 1 ranking while the Trojans stalled in third place.
“It’ll be another tough match,” said sophomore goalkeeper Joel Dennerley. “It was tough last year, and they’re pretty dominant this year, so it’ll be a challenge for us.”
Surprisingly, the two teams have not met yet this season, despite their successes. USC and Stanford have participated in two tournaments — the NorCal Tournament in Palo Alto, Calif., and the UCI Invitational in Irvine, Calif. — together, but after a Trojan loss to UCLA in the NorCal tourney and a Cardinal loss to Cal at UCI, the teams were never given the chance to square off against each other.
But while it may seem that the two squads have had little impact on each other this season, their recent history with each other leaves little to the Trojans’ imagination as to what to prepare for.
“We haven’t played Stanford this year, and not since the NCAA finals last year, but we still prepare the same way we would for any other team,” Dennerley said. “We’ve watched them at other tournaments. They lost a few players last year, but the core of their team is more or less still there and they are doing the same things. We’ll match up as we need to, but it’ll be a tough game.”
USC won all four of its games against Stanford last season, but three of them were decided by two goals or less. The most notable of the victories came in the NCAA championship game, in which the Trojans clinched their fourth national title with a 7-5 win. Every NCAA title the Trojans have won has come against Stanford.
The Trojans avoided a major obstacle last weekend against UCLA on the road to set the stage for this important match, beating the Bruins 7-6 on a last-minute score from junior driver Kyle Sterling. But last week’s game doesn’t change anything for the team as they head into this week’s match, USC coach Jovan Vavic said.
“The last game is over,” Vavic said. “This is a different opponent with different strengths, so we really have to get ready for it. We don’t labor on wins that much. We just have to get ready and execute. We have to focus on Stanford’s strengths, because they have a couple of really good players.”
The winner of this match will gain sole possession of first place in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference, and will likely take the first seed in the MPSF tournament in late November.
“I think both teams are going to be excited that we finally get to play each other,” Vavic said. “I think it’s going to be a very emotional game for both teams, because this is the first time we’ll see each other after the [NCAA tournament]. Both teams have one loss, and the winner will be in really good shape.”

For most of the USC women’s cross country team, Saturday’s NCAA West Regional meet in Springfield, Ore., will be the last race of the 2009 season.
It also serves as a chance to show that the Women of Troy’s ninth-place finish at the Pac-10 Championship was not indicative of the team’s potential.
“This is a great chance for us to build off of Pac-10s,” USC coach Tom Walsh said. “It’s one last chance to get a real important race in.”
Although only one of USC’s runners, junior Zsofia Erdelyi, appears on track to qualify for the NCAA Championships, Walsh insists that the West Regionals are just as important for the other members of the team, especially underclassmen.
“This is great experience for the rest of the girls,” Walsh said. “They will learn so much and their improvement curve will be much better after they run this race. Looking ahead to the future, we have a lot of freshmen that are starting out at a high point and are going to be productive in our program for the next four years.”
The race also holds a bit of extra importance for four of USC’s eight competing runners. Senior captain Bridget Helgerson is a native of Portland, Ore., and freshman Kathleen Moloney, senior Katherine Ellis, and junior Zara Lukens all hail from Washington.
“This is basically a homecoming for half of our team,” Walsh said. “I think it’ll be a boost to these four girls to be back in familiar territory.”
On the course, however, Saturday’s race holds the greatest significance for Erdelyi, who is looking to qualify for the NCAA Championships for the second consecutive year. The junior standout from Hungary is coming off a slightly subpar race at the Pac-10 Championships.
But Walsh says he is not worried about Erdelyi’s chances to compete at NCAAs.
“Every year she’s finished higher at regionals than she has at Pac-10s,” Walsh said. “We’re hoping that is something she continues. I have faith that she will.”
Last season, Erdelyi finished 17th overall at Pac-10 Championships, then rebounded to finish eighth overall at West Regionals two weeks later. Walsh estimated that Erdelyi would have to finish somewhere in the top 20 overall at this year’s meet in order to qualify for nationals.
Rounding out USC’s competitors on Saturday are juniors Christine Cortez and Dina Kitayama, along with freshman Christy Ambrosini, who will be an alternate.
The women’s 6K race will begin on Saturday at 10:45 a.m. at Springfield Golf Course.

Considered an indie romantic comedy, director Barra Grant’s Love Hurts is painful viewing for audience members seeking a sappy indulgence. The only tears a movie watcher might shed are from laughter.
The movie stars British actor Richard E. Grant as Ben Bingham, an ear, nose and throat doctor who is oblivious to how his beautiful, nature-loving wife Amanda is withering, not unlike the flowers she tends, as he fails to love and appreciate her.
Heart pains · Love Hurts follows a father (Richard E. Grant) and son (Johnny Pacar) through their romantic tribulations. The film opens today. - Photos courtesy of Lantern Lane Entertainment
When she cries, he dismissively states that she is PMS-ing; it is one of several funny moments in the beginning of the film where Ben makes various obtuse comments.
Finally, Amanda, dreading being alone with Ben once their son leaves for college, moves in with her best friend Gloria, played by Camryn Manheim, and starts seeing a buff horticulturist from the South.
When Ben “surprisingly” fails to win Amanda back with a bonsai plant, he resorts to drinking and moping in bed until his son Justin (Johnny Pacar) makes him the most popular single man in town by advising him to get a new haircut and wardrobe. Miraculously, (it’s Hollywood after all) women start falling for him.
He starts seeing his sushi-crazed nurse, his unorthodox Jewish gym trainer and a pair of karaoke-singing twins.
The majority of the laughs come from the montages of Ben dating these women. As he rendezvous with the three women — well, four, but the twins might as well be one person — his son falls in love with a Russian ballerina named Valeriya (newcomer Olga Fonda). Suddenly, Ben has to clean up his act and revisit his past romantic self in order to help his son woo his new love.
Along the way, Amanda notices the man she fell in love with returning.
The plotline, led by the father-son-exchange of how to win women, is the most successful aspect of the film. Director Grant highlights just how dysfunctional their advice to each other is to draw out laughs. In one scene Ben advises Justin to take two fingers and gently run them along Valeriya’s face. He also tells him to mutter nonsense when cradling her face, and suddenly we’re watching two men stroke each other’s cheeks while muttering gibberish.
A nod goes to Pacar, who recently won the Best Supporting Actor award for his performance in Love Hurts at the Orlando Film Festival.
Pacar’s performance makes the film more bearable to watch. His character begins as a magnetic stud with a long list of “friends with benefits” and transforms into a more sensitive man as he pursues a ballerina who does not fall for him as easily as the string of girls who appear throughout the movie desperate for his attention.
Contrasting the fitting casting of Pacar is the casting of Carrie-Anne Moss, which seems awkward and forced, as if producers only considered her recognizable name when giving her the role. Most remembered for her performance as Trinity, the romantic interest of main character Neo from the Matrix trilogy, Moss also starred in the critically acclaimed independent thriller, Memento.
Audience members are left wondering why someone like Moss is playing a character who in her youth wore a jockey strap on her head to make her boyfriend-now-husband Ben laugh.
Justin’s friends Zoe, Trev and Kat, dressed in skinny jeans with dyed hair, high-five Ben throughout the movie as women fall for him. They are all completely unfazed by Ben’s actions, because their parents are separated and sleeping around, too. They manage to successfully capture the current generation growing up in families with divorced parents who don’t believe in love. Although they play apathetic teenagers well, they are very frustrating to watch. From their wardrobe to their overly stereotypical actions (Zoe makes a batch of fudge laced with marijuana), they contrast Justin too much and appear one-dimensional and boring.
A few scenes in the movie warrant solid gut-busters, but it mainly draws chuckles from audience members who grow tired in the middle of the film at the exaggerated stereotypes of many of the characters.
Considering the movie’s low budget, director Grant makes a watchable film. The predictable plot, however, relies too much on the cliché teachings between generations.

In order for a radio pitch to be effective, it is imperative that the person making the pitch expresses some kind of interest. So, while recording an on-air promo for one local charity’s vehicle donation program, it seemed like a plus that talk radio personality Frank Kramer was endorsing the services so animatedly.
“They even accept planes, for Christ’s sake!” Kramer relayed to listeners.
Talking heads · After gaining popularity on the now-defunct FM station KLSX, the talk-radio comedy trio Frosty, Heidi and Frank are broadcast daily on 790 KABC, an AM station that airs news and commentary. - Photos courtesy of Daniella Maestasn
Ordinarily, the enthusiasm would have been fine. This promo, however, was for the Jewish Community Centers of Greater Los Angeles.
Considering the fact that Kramer mentioned the name of the Messiah in a spot for a Jewish nonprofit, the fallout from the slip-up was negligible. It could have been the regretful look he shot the control room immediately after making the ironic faux-pas or the fact that the mistake was too funny to get all that worked up about, but the most likely explanation for the lack of backlash is that this sort of thing has come to be expected from Frosty, Heidi and Frank.
“We’ve been told to hijack the station,” said Kramer, who along with Frosty Stilwell and Heidi Hamilton accounts for one-third of the talk radio comedy trio Frosty, Heidi and Frank.
The station being commandeered is TalkRadio 790 KABC, an AM frequency best known as the broadcast home of Dodgers baseball.
“KABC is like a heritage station,” Frosty said. “It’s a legendary set of call letters: KABC.”
The three new additions to the station’s morning lineup have been doing their best to complete the task they’ve been given — that is, revitalizing the AM talk-radio format.
Since making their AM radio debut on Oct. 5, KABC’s ratings for the weekday morning timeslot leapt a staggering 187 percent in the first eight days of being on the air.
Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to noon, Frosty, Heidi and Frank discuss the news of the day, though quotes around the words “discuss” and “news” are probably in order. Sometimes the conversation topics are timely and socially relevant, but most of the stories trucked out in the course of the show are gleefully inconsequential and bizarre.
To get an idea of the show’s roundabout meandering through topics, here’s the description accompanying the Frosty, Heidi and Frank Uncensored podcast for Oct. 23: “Guantanamo Bay, snoopers, chivalry, dating, magic jackets.”
In their new home on 790 AM, Frosty, Heidi and Frank have been handed a far older demographic than they’re accustomed to — the station management reports an average listener age of 67.
Beyond tugging down the mean age of KABC listeners, the vibrant personalities they bring to their three-hour show are expected to infuse color into the monotone landscape that is AM radio as most know it.
“If you listen to the AM talk stations in LA or any city that you want to listen to, it’s pretty much right-wing, conservative political talk,” Frosty said. “That’s not what we are.”
Frosty, Heidi and Frank certainly do make for an unlikely presence on the predominantly conservative and woefully low-fidelity AM airwaves.
The three Indiana natives represent a break from the convention of how an AM talk radio host is expected to look, talk or think: Kramer is a self-described “hound dog” with a penchant for the daily enjoyment of both marijuana and members of the opposite sex; Hamilton is a wine fiend and proud lesbian who reportedly to possess an eight-inch tongue; Stilwell, far and away the oldest of the group, is described in the lead-in to the uncensored podcast they record after the main show as the “overweight, middle-aged, sexually obscure one.”
“We butt-slam right into Sean Hannity,” Kramer eagerly pointed out. Sure enough, the Frosty, Heidi and Frank show does in fact precede ultra-conservative pundit Sean Hannity’s three-hour broadcast in the KABC weekday lineup. To any informed observer, the scheduling irony has all the makings of the setup to some sort of big cosmic joke.
Although the trio is practically a study in diversity with very few common interests that don’t come in a bottle or a can, they are fiercely loyal in their support of one another.
“We’re showing people that, you know, you don’t have to totally agree or be a part of whatever that lifestyle is [to defend it],” Kramer said.
He offered the example that, although she doesn’t smoke weed, Hamilton thinks of Kramer when someone asks her to sign a petition against a pot dispensary down the block and refuses. Similarly, when it comes to a gay pride parade, Kramer will usually be sitting right next to Hamilton, waving to the crowd.
The three co-hosts were also there for one another during their recent bout of unemployment.
The seven months of being jobless, which began in late February with the conclusion of their hugely successful experiment in FM talk radio on KLSX 97.1 and ended with the Oct. 5 kickoff of their current gig on 790 KABC, almost proved too much to bear for the talk-radio veterans.
“The audience feedback was great while we were off the air — the support was awesome,” Kramer recalled. “Everyone was saying, ‘We need you guys.’ But I didn’t realize how much I needed them, or I needed to have that outlet … I didn’t realize that this show was my therapy.”
Frosty, Heidi and Frank’s eight and a half-year stint on the novel FM talk station KLSX ended for reasons paradoxical at best.
“When we left KLSX, we left at number one,” Stillwell said. “So we left not through any failing or fault of our own, and the corporate people from New York acknowledged that. They said, ‘It’s nothing to do with you, you didn’t do anything wrong, it’s a corporate decision to save money to eliminate the entire staff.’”
Kramer revealed that the ratings bonuses alone that the three of them were due to receive would have been in the six-figure range, collectively. After so many successful ratings periods (year after year, they sat comfortably at the number one spot for the vast majority of their run on KLSX), they were a part of what was probably the most expensive station in the entire CBS radio chain.
Stillwell speculated that the cut-and-dry decision was an easy one for the dispassionate “bean counters on the other coast.”
“They looked at the payroll and said, ‘Wow, we’re paying this much to keep a station on the air? Let’s get rid of them and go to music for nothing,’” he said.
Heidi added, “We got punished for being successful.”
Kramer approached the others about doing a weekly podcast and on March 9, only 17 days after the dissolution of KLSX 97.1, the first one-hour Frosty, Heidi and Frank Uncensored podcast premiered on iTunes. The now-daily podcast, which was originally recorded in a studio in Santa Monica, Calif. and later in a recording studio Stillwell built in his own dining room (named “Rudy Dog Studios” in memory of his trusty sidekick and loyal pet Rudy Dog), is now recorded just down the hall from where the main KABC show is broadcasted, although in a visibly dinkier studio.
Seven months later, the trio’s savior came in the shape of a former authority figure.
“When we were coming down to the wire of our contracts being paid out, our old boss Bob Moore, who backed us up from day one at 97.1, [wanted] us to come over here and have the opportunity once again to do something that nobody’s ever done before,” Kramer said. “Let’s revolutionize AM radio, let’s revitalize that. Let’s get the defibrillator and shock AM radio back into reality and to be relevant again.”
Consider the paddles fired up.
I got introduced to FHF by my dad when I was 13 years old.  I’m 20 now and this radio station is something I can talk and laugh about with my dad who I rarely talk with.  I have never missed a show since and download every podcast they produce and will continue to follow them wherever they go.  KABC is great and gets another listener out of me because of FHF and now 97.1 is no longer allowed in the car.  Love ya Frosty, Heidi and Frank!!!
FRANK ARMY!!!
We need these guys on the air more than ever. People have to realize that we are living in 2009 not 1909. I think it’s fair to say that the real non political shock jock radio hosts are gone. The weird thing is that FHF don’t sound like they are hosts. They sound like a couple three  friends sitting in a bar having some fun kickass conversation that you get to here pumping out of your speakers. They don’t have that fake radio voice that most radio personalities have. Oh and for you boring old timers that are focused in on my grammatical mistakes…….It’s 2009 biatches.
I am from Phoenix AZ and have been listening to FHF since they replaced Howard Stern on our local station. I don’t think I have ever missed a show on air or podcast. I will faithfully follow them wherever they go!!
I have been listening to FHF for more than 6 years; so funny and entertaining; and as other guys said about AM Conservative radio in LA has no place; big example Tim Conway JR; who was funny as hell at 97.1 but now after he moved to AM and changed his personality exactly like Glenn beck when he moved to fox; i have no respect at all to Tim Conway JR; and am sorry to spend the time listing to him; and am sure his show “i don’t even know if he still on the air”; am sure no one listen’s to his crap. but FHF are the fumiest group on the radio.
I need these guys. I didn’t realize how much I needed them, or I needed to have that outlet … I didn’t realize that this show was my therapy.
I’ve been an FHF fan for about three years, and cannot express how happy I am that Frosty, Heidi, and Frank are back on the air!  FM Talk is dead, FM music is obsolete in a world of iPod’s where you can hear any song on demand rather than the crap and commercials you’re being force fed.  Internet radio is shaping up, but FHF are giving it one last chance to turn around or be left behind!
Thanks Frosty, Heidi, and Frank!
-Matt from Canada
I love FHF. They are my therapy during and after a long work day.
Most People are center to left in Los Angeles and the conservative talk radio in this city has no real place.  As well as people are sick of hearing the politic of hate radio.  FHF are entertainment, current events and news story oriented.  Frosty, Heidi and Frank are up front, pragmatic, and make you laugh!  After listening to them you begin to feel like they are your friends.  We are lucky to have them here in LA.
I have been a loyal listener of the show since they were on Star 98.7.  KABC did themselves, FHF and us listeners a HUGE favor by putting them back on the air!!!  So thank you KABC for giving us back 3 more hours of FHF because a one hour podcast is just not enough!!  I love you guys and will follow you wherever you go!!!

Ours is a violent generation, and Cormac McCarthy knows it. He knows it, and he knows how to exploit us for it.
The final third of Joel and Ethan Coen’s adaptation of McCarthy’s No Country for Old Men was one of the most divisive acts of cinema committed this decade.
After establishing a violent and desperate duel between a protagonist and his relentless antagonist, McCarthy and the Coens pull us out, killing one of the characters offscreen and denying the viewer the satisfaction of watching him die.
Worse yet, as in the novel, the Coen Brothers conclude one of the most thrillingly violent films of its generation with Tommy Lee Jones sitting at a table talking about his dreams.
Needless to say, many filmgoers used to climaxing in the form of a gunshot, a blood mist and the heavy collapse of a body were frothing at the mouth.
That’s just how McCarthy, the great literary critic of America’s culture of violence, wanted us to react.
McCarthy speaks to our desire for gore and slaughter and conquest, but he speaks to it in a way that slowly drains the adrenaline from those desires and leaves our veins hollow.
His books — and the films they have inspired — are structurally and thematically bitter medicine, but certainly a potent cure for the delirium caused by the likes of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez.
The latest film drawn out of McCarthy’s oeuvre is The Road, based on his 2007 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, which opens over Thanksgiving weekend .
The Road is the natural culmination of its author’s long history of violence: McCarthy painted historical scenes of psychotic death and destruction in the old and modern West with Blood Meridian and No Country, and the post-apocalyptic vision of The Road follows this trend. Like No Country, it is a film that will force viewers back onto their heels.
McCarthy writes inherently cinematic scenes, yet the way he puts these scenes together is anti-classical from a cinematic standpoint. The two faithful adaptations of his works are evidence of this.
The Road will undoubtedly be less divisive, but its starkly steady pace — where no episode on the journey of a father and son through a post-apocalyptic world is given precedence over another and nothing is clearly introduced — almost guarantees that no satisfactory conclusion will be reached. Unlike No Country for Old Men, which skipped its climax altogether, The Road merely makes the climax of the wanderers’ story just one more episode in a series. The matter-of-factness of the storytelling is true to McCarthy’s style, but is still quite distancing from a cinematic standpoint.
If The Road — in all its successes and failures as a film — has convinced me of anything, it is that Blood Meridian is probably unfilmable.
McCarthy’s legendary 1985 anti-Western about an amoral band of murderers who wander the Southwest taking scalps possesses a very similar structure.
Consider the individual scenes of Blood Meridian: the tense duel in a massive boneyard, the pre-Darwin conversation about evolution around a campfire, the senseless massacre of a Mexican village. These are moments that read like treatments for great film scenes. Like No Country and The Road, these scenes are masterpieces on their own yet, when strung together as narrative, they feel unnatural and stilted, especially for those with classical cinematic sensibilities.
Blood Meridian is also denser than The Road, and McCarthy’s sparse, jarring prose allows him to pack the narrative with hundreds of moments all fit for adaptation yet all difficult to leave on the cutting room floor.
The adaptation of Blood Meridian has had numerous directors attached to it over the years, most notably Ridley Scott.
It is currently in the hands of Todd Field (Little Children), a director who has made excellent films of smaller scope and may or may not be able to meet the challenges of such an epic story.
Oddly, after seeing The Proposition, a film with brutal and brilliant anti-Western sensibilities transplanted into the Australian outback, I immediately imagined that the director behind such a stunning expression of violence set against a bleak, sun-scorched hell-scape would be perfect for Blood Meridian. The director of The Proposition, John Hillcoat, has proved extremely capable — if not quite as poetic as in his first effort — at the helm of The Road.
Blood Meridian might have an inherently uncinematic structure, but the novel is part of a long modern tradition of reexamining the way we view our culture’s history in the American southwest. When it originally appeared, McCarthy’s novel was one of the first great literary salvos fired against the myth of the American western.
While John Wayne’s last film — 1976’s The Shootist — was one of the first and best such cinematic attacks on the genre, it was not until Clint Eastwood’s Unforgiven that cinema examined the true nature of the violent old West in a way that mirrored McCarthy’s nearly apocalyptic vision of slaughter.
In a way, Eastwood’s film was probably the last worthwhile American expression of the classic genre, but a faithful adaptation of McCarthy’s significantly bloodier version could stand to put a final exclamation point on our deconstruction of our great cinematic myths. It might leave the same bitter taste as No Country for Old Men and The Road, but sometimes we need to be challenged in order for the message of a film to truly take root.

Investigations have been launched in the wake of the discovery that all of the allegations of racial profiling brought against Los Angeles Police Department officers since 2001 have been dismissed.
A 2008 study conducted by a professor at Yale found that, among the suspects who are stopped by LAPD, blacks are 127 percent more likely and Latinos are 43 percent more likely to be frisked than Caucasians.
Andrew Laskowski | Daily Trojan
These figures are statistical proof of the bias that riddles the LAPD’s policing methods. Of the 20 investigations currently being conducted within the department, about a third have been found to be biased based on race, gender or sexual orientation.
Bias is an unfortunate part of human nature, which raises the question: When law enforcement officers are concerned, should they be held to a higher standard? The fact that police officers don a uniform and a badge doesn’t rule them out as humans with natural biases, but the authority accorded to the LAPD gives them an added responsibility of strictly policing themselves to ensure objectivity.
Newly retired LAPD Chief William Bratton is credited with reducing the crime rate in Los Angeles by 30 percent and working to train police officers who understand the relationships and biases faced by the constituents. One of his initiatives, however, titled “Bias-free policing,” has yet to be realized, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.
With his departure, Chief-Designate Charlie Beck understands the complex intricacy of the position.
“[Biased policing is] something I’m going to closely monitor. I’m going to work with the police commission on it,” he said in an interview with KABC. “It’s important to me that we determine exactly to what extent officers’ actions are based on racial bias.”
Though he agrees that bias, as a human trait, cannot be eradicated, it can certainly be mitigated by the LAPD. Though this sounds noble and potentially beneficial, some, like commenters on KABC’s website, vehemently disagree with Beck’s mission. Some are even in favor of the biased policing, with one reader calling it “good police work.”
It’s difficult to discern whether those comments are the product of ingrained prejudices or learned experiences. Whether the police officers were acting on biases or rational thinking, it may be impossible to know.
Citizens are subject to the police institution and the law that governs it. Maintaining faith in the system is essential for the system to work. It is the job of the newly designated chief to work hard to enforce an anti-bias policy. Only then can the LAPD reverse the biased reputation it has had for the past decades.
Beck’s ideas of installing surveillance cameras in police cars to actively monitor police officers’ decision-making methods is one step in the right direction, though it is not a foolproof method. It certainly is a sensitive topic to consider, and Beck’s task of reducing the bias that colors police work — while maintaining the level of discretion that enables effective policing — will be a colossal undertaking.
We can only hope that the new police chief lives up to these promises to bring a better reputation to the police department.

Back in Arizona when I was senior in high school, my calculus teacher surveyed the class about what colleges they wanted to attend. About 40 percent raised their hands when he asked if anyone was interested in Arizona State University.
He then handed each student with their hands up what he said was ASU’s application. Inside was a coloring book. If you stayed inside the line, you were accepted.
USC’s reputation has been similarly colored by stereotypes, which the university has worked hard in the past two decades to eradicate. While USC has focused in part on boosting its academics, the school’s push for community service has won it acclamations like Time magazine’s “College of the Year” in 2000.
As USC faces a transitional period in the course of the university’s 30-year Master Plan, it faces the challenge of helping the surrounding the community without overtaking it.
USC’s reputation is a doubled-edged sword. On one side, USC boasts a distinct level of prestige and accomplishment that every student should take pride in. It’s what sets USC apart and what students highlight when they talk about their educational experience to friends, families and employers.
On the other hand, though, USC students are often stereotyped as spoiled and unconcerned about the struggling community around them. The reputation of the self-absorbed rich kid hasn’t quite disappeared.
USC should be acknowledged for reaching out to its neighbors while it tries to expand, but the next decade will be pivotal in keeping a neighborly reputation.
It is primarily up to students — and secondarily the school officials — to sustain their community efforts and continue building partnerships in the community.
USC shares the neighborhood with its residents. Unchecked development and disregard for the community could destroy the school’s carefully built relationship with the area.
Fortunately, some USC students already understand this predicament and are taking the right steps to ensure the community grows with USC and is not just pushed aside.
USG community affairs committee has been holding forums between the students, school officials and local community figures, in which everyone has an equal opportunity to discuss their feelings on USC’s expansion.
Community forums are definitely the right approach, but higher student participation is needed to continue building relations with the community.
USC students have made another notable effort to improve community relations. Recently, two USC students, Daniel Wu and Samantha Foley, were appointed to a local neighborhood council.
This forms a direct partnership between the community and school by letting students personally facilitate the needs and concerns for the university and the community, rather than school officials.
This is the exact type of developments the university must continue to foster to overcome its prior reputation.
No one can create change overnight, but the best approach for USC is to continue building relations with the neighboring community through outreach and involvement. USC has already worked to establish trust within the community through volunteer programs, economic support and community boards that bring in local people to discuss their concerns about USC’s effect on its neighbors.
USC should be commended for its efforts, but it still has a lot of work to do to reconcile its interests with the community and improve its reputation.

Former USC basketball coach Tim Floyd was hired as the top assistant coach for the New Orleans Hornets.
The announcement came on the heels of the firing of head coach Byron Scott, who was dismissed after only nine games.
The Hornets had high expectations coming into the season after the acquisition of center Emeka Okafor to complement All-Star point guard Chris Paul. However, the Hornets only had a 3-6 start to the season, including a twenty-point loss to the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday.
Scott will be replaced by general manager Jeff Bower.
Floyd was previously the head coach of the Hornets during the 2003-2004 season. At USC, Floyd led the Trojans to an 85-48 record, including a Sweet 16 appearance in the NCAA Tournament. Floyd resigned as the head coach of USC in June of 2009, amidst allegations that he used cash to attract guard O.J. Mayo to the university.
Floyd, who has kept a low profile since resigning from USC, recently made headlines trying breaking up a fight involving several women at the Morongo Casino in Palm Desert, Calif.

Four high school seniors signed letters of intent Wednesday, the first day of the NCAA’s early signing period, to join the USC basketball team next year.
Guards Maurice Jones and Bryce Jones (no relation) and forwards Curtis Washington and Garrett Jackson have all committed to play for the Trojans. Forward Dwayne Polee has verbally committed to USC but is not expected to sign immediately because his father is an employee of the university.
Both Polee and Bryce Jones are ranked in the ESPNU Top 100. The Trojans’ class is ranked No. 13 in the nation by ESPNU and No. 1 among Pac-10 schools.
“This is a great class in terms of what we were looking to sign,” USC men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill said in a press release. “All of these guys are good players, good students and good athletes.”

As universities nationwide increase their reliance on adjunct professors, some are raising concerns about the shrinking number of full-time professors and the way adjuncts are often treated, including at USC.
Adjuncts, for the most part, are part-time faculty who come in on a semester-by-semester basis to teach one course, taking time out of their professional schedule to do so. Adjunct professors are paid less than full-time or tenured staff at USC, and don’t receive full benefits.

Each school, especially the pre-professional schools, brings on adjunct faculty to supplement the textbook teaching and academic education with the real-world experience of a professional in a classroom setting.
The Chronicle of Higher Education recently reported that part-time adjuncts have grown to make up about 50 percent of the teaching staff nationwide.
The concern nationwide is that the down economy is causing schools to hire more adjuncts, since they cost less and have short-term contracts. But administrators claim that at USC, the economy is not a factor in hiring of adjuncts.  Instead, adjuncts are hired in response to a student demand or their specific insight.
“We might have an emergency, somebody gets sick, or we bring in an adjunct who is a leading expert,” said John Matsusaka, the vice dean for faculty and academic affairs at the Marshall School of Business. “Money is not a factor. The question is whether there is a sudden surge in demand for a certain class, or a tenured professor has to go off for a year, and we don’t want to hire full-time for a year or two.”
At USC, adjuncts make up just 29 percent of the faculty. Still, that number has grown — last year there were 14 more adjunct professors than the 2007-2008 school year, even as the total number of faculty members decreased.
Imre Meszaros, assistant director of the Annenberg School of Communication, said finances are not restricting the school’s hiring process. Though hiring a larger proportion of adjuncts would save the school money, Meszaros said the school tries to hire full-time faculty because they play a greater role in the university community.
“If every class was taught by adjuncts, we would save money, but what you have to realize is what full-time faculty are paid for is more than just teaching,” Meszaros said.
This difference in university involvement outside of the classroom is seen as both a benefit and a drawback to adjuncts. Many adjuncts, as professionals, have little time to be on campus. They often aren’t required to attend faculty meetings and don’t hold much weight in administrative decisions.
“The cool thing about being an adjunct is that it’s like being an uncle. You get to come in, fire people up, do the work, and then leave. No heavy lifting of the administrative part of being a member of the faculty,” said David Belasco, an adjunct professor in the USC entrepreneurship program.
But there is often a disconnect between adjuncts and the university, said Julio Moran, an adjunct professor who is the executive director for a Latino journalists advocacy group and who worked for the Los Angeles Times for 14 years and has been teaching journalism news writing and reporting for more than 10 years at the Annenberg School of Communication & Journalism.
“We’re on campus one day a week, and it’s difficult to establish relationships when you’re only there one day. Not many attend faculty or staff events, not because we’re not invited, but because many people just don’t have the time. They have their full-time job,” Moran said.
Amy Murphy, the vice dean of the School of Architecture, said that her school is at least taking steps to keep adjuncts involved as valued staff members.
“We use the term ‘adjunct’ as a distinction of part-time faculty for the professionals we really love,” she said. “We’ve been trying to distinguish them and appreciate them more.  We’ve offered some multi-year contracts and reinstated voting rights at faculty meetings.”
Disconnect from the university is not the only cause for concern among the school’s growing number of adjunct professors. Salaries are low, and benefits and job security are nonexistent.
“It’s probably minimum wage when you break down the hours spent preparing, teaching [and] grading to teach a class well,” Moran said. “No one’s doing it for the money. It’s something you’re interested in, something you enjoy, and you hope you’re making a difference.”
Belasco, who spent time building and selling companies before coming to Marshall to teach, said despite the designation as “part-time,” the job of an adjunct professor is a full-time commitment.
“There’s no such thing as a part-time professor, with the amount of time it takes to prepare, arrange speakers, grade assignments, meet with students — it’s a full-time job with part-time pay,” Belasco said. “And the students want that commitment.”
Jerry Swerling, a professor of professional practice and the director of public relations studies at the USC Annenberg Strategic Communication and Public Relations Center, said these factors — low pay and contracts that only last a semester — can affect students and adjuncts alike.
“There’s a term, ‘freeway flyers,’ that refers to folks — to adjuncts — who run from school to school, from USC to UCLA, for example, trying to piece together a living,” Swerling said. “That’s just not fair for them, for students or for anyone … The adjuncts we use are for the most part senior level practitioners who are working at PR firms or big companies.”
Some students find the use of adjuncts in certain classes beneficial.
“It is nice that they can bring their own personal experience into the classroom — for example, my Journalism 203 teacher was able to schedule a tour of a broadcast studio during a prime newscast because of her position there, which is something a tenured professor wouldn’t be able to provide,” said Kara Hansell, a sophomore majoring in public relations.
Others, however, said they don’t know which of their professors are adjuncts and which aren’t — though that may be a good thing.
“Honestly, I don’t know what that is. I wouldn’t be able to tell if I have taken a class by an adjunct,” said Matt Held, a sophomore majoring in business administration.

In an effort to boost security on campus, USC’s Department of Public Safety plans to limit after-hours access to some University Park Campus buildings by December.
The new access control system will require students, faculty and staff to swipe their ID cards at nine classroom buildings after 6 p.m., which also allows DPS to monitor people going in or coming out of the buildings.
Open sesame · Iwari DeWees, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering, uses his keycard to enter the Biomedical Microsystems Lab. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan
The system is an attempt to improve student safety on campus, according to Shane Hapuarachy, DPS special project manager.
“The buildings we chose have a lot of petty thefts going on in them,” Hapuarachy said. “The main point of the system is to limit access.”
The system will be installed in Von KleinSmid Center, Grace Ford Salvatori Hall, Taper Hall, the Social Sciences Building, Hoffman Hall, Waite Phillips Hall, Vivian Hall, Watt Hall and Kaprielian Hall. DPS plans to have the system running by Dec. 1, Hapuarachy said.
The buildings will remain open during regular school hours, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. After that, students, faculty and staff will have to use their ID cards to enter the buildings until 11 p.m. Department heads will also be able to authorize others so they can have access to the buildings at all hours.
According to Hapuarachy, access control is not a new concept for the university. Currently, USC has similar systems on nearly all Health Science Campus buildings, all UPC dormitory buildings and several other USC-owned
high-security buildings.
DPS had originally planned to put access card readers on eight buildings at the UPC, but a reconfigured budget allowed it to add one more to the list.
“We already rolled out this project at Health Sciences, and we kept the same crew, so people became more efficient,” Hapuarachy said.
The system notifies DPS if a door is left propped open after hours or if someone without authorization has broken into the building. It also allows DPS to keep a record of those who go in and out of the buildings, in case a crime occurs.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said students will still have to be
careful, because piggybacking — when someone holds doors open for people who may not have authorization to enter — could still be an issue.
In case of an emergency situation, the system will also allow DPS to lock the buildings automatically.
“If a Virginia Tech shooter situation occurred, we would be able to lock the buildings,” said Hapuarachy, referring to the incident in 2007 when a college student opened fire at the Virginia Tech campus.
Students said they appreciate the steps USC is taking to make them feel safer on campus.
“It will make students feel more comfortable using the classroom buildings for club meetings or study groups,” said Christie Tcharkhoutian, a senior majoring in psychology and music industry.
But some are concerned that the new system could result in overcrowded libraries, especially during finals week, because other buildings will not be available for studying.
“I usually go to VKC whenever I have a study group, and I know a lot of people tend to stay there until midnight or later,” said Diana Lee, a junior majoring in communication. “So closing at 11 p.m. will just make Leavey [Library] even more chaotic.”
Carlisle said DPS is always
looking for ways to improve safety on campus.
“This is one of many programs we’ve considered, along with video technology, and adding more coverage around USC,” he said. “It’s an overall initiative that will always be evolving.”
Good plan, I hope students and staff work cooperate with the new program.
Diana Lee is not credible…
Finally, there’s a practical solution to thwart or preclude the thugs from entering USC buildings to commit their crimes.

Now that the burgeoning LA Live — Downtown’s entertainment hub — has added a movie theater, the nearby University Village Flagship Theaters has begun worrying about its future.
The new Regal Cinema at LA Live opened two weeks ago, premiering Michael Jackson’s This is It to a crowd of hundreds. The theater boasts three floors and more than 3,500 seats, leaving Flagship’s three movie screens in the dust.
Full House · Movie patrons visit Flagship Theaters in the University Village. The  cinema complex is facing competition from the newly opened Regal Cinemas at LA Live. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
“I’d be lying if I said the competition wasn’t in the back of my mind,” said Leo Sanchez, manager of the UV’s Flagship Theaters.
Before Regal Cinema opened at LA Live, Flagship was the only option for students who wanted to see a movie without having to drive or use public transportation. But after the launch of a free shuttle to take students from campus to LA Live, moviegoers finally have another option.
Though business was already good at LA Live’s Regal Cinema, Michael Roth, vice president of communications for AEG, which runs LA Live, said the easy access will only help the theater grow.
“The shuttle’s going to make a big difference,” Roth said. “It’s a way for students to not have to worry about parking or eating dinner or having a drink and having to drive afterwards.”
The shuttles just launched last week, and already Flagship has seen a drop in customer turnout. Sanchez noted, however, that this could be caused by a combination of factors.
Turnout at Regal Cinema has been much more encouraging, and student opinion also seems to favor Regal.
“It’s a lot better than the UV … It’s newer, cleaner,” said Adriana Granados, a junior majoring in psychology who attended the free movie screening.
Some students said it is the atmosphere of Regal Cinema that draws them Downtown and away from the UV.
“It makes you feel like you’re actually going to the movies,” said Britney Young, a senior majoring in critical studies.
Young said the large theater setting, the food and the movie posters create a more traditional moviegoing atmosphere.
Although both offer student discounts, Flagship offers $5 tickets for those with USC ID, as opposed to $10 at Regal.
Roth said he does think Regal is creating competition for the UV Flagship Theater.
“The fact of the matter is that these are the most comfortable theaters in town,” he said. “For big events, you want to see them in the best conditions, and that’s what Regal provides.”
But Sanchez insists the Flagship Theater does offer some things the Regal Cinema does not, like its prices and close proximity to campus. Sanchez hopes these factors will keep attracting students to Flagship.
“It’s a nice little humble theater,” Sanchez said. “It only has three screens, but it’s nice and we offer very low prices.”
Sanchez said the theater will be hurt financially if a large number of students migrate to LA Live’s Regal Cinema. Though some local residents frequent the theater, he said students are the target audience.
“We serve the community, but to be quite honest, we like to accommodate students,” Sanchez said. “We want them to come here.”
Well, until the tram started running, there wasn’t another theater Max could get to without driving or taking a roundabout route on public transit.  Now that Max has a choice, presumably he’ll pay for the experience he actually wants (Regal) vs. what was previously the only choice near campus (UV).  That should make you happy, right, Maxisdumb?
Sure, Max could have put it more nicely, but he’s essentially saying that competition should force UV to improve its services.  Because of that, you think he lives in a bubble?  Because of that you wish him harm?  Why so angry?
“Well, until the tram started running, there wasn’t another theater Max could get to without driving or taking a roundabout route on public transit”…You know what an entitlement attitude is?
Do you know what “meeting a market need” means? Do you know what isn’t indicative of an entitlement attitude? Desiring a clean movie theater. Or are people living in less affluent areas not “entitled” to nice things?
Apparently, wanting a cleaner environment merits becoming a DPS statistic.
Stay happy with your status quo.
Max, have you ever heard the saying, “you get what you pay for”? You need to be pulled out your bubble and into reality. If you dislike the subpar conditions at the UV, then don’t go to the UV. You aren’t under duress to patronize it.
I hope you become a DPS statistic so that you’re pulled out of your coddled state–ya snob!
This theater is probably the most disgusting place I have ever sat down in. No joke, I think a public toilet seat would be cleaner than the seats in this theater. The staff are not courteous, the place is gross, I hope that LA Live destroys business for this theater so that they will be forced to actually make somewhat of an effort to attract business.
