USC’s men’s and women’s tennis teams put their talents on exhibition at their first tournaments this past week, and made it clear that their offseason training has prepared them for success.

Members of the men’s squad traveled to Tulsa, Okla. to compete in the ITA All-American Championships, which was full of surprises for the Trojans.
Junior Jonny Wang and senior Michael Grant fought their way through the qualifying rounds to secure themselves spots in the main draw of the tournament. They quickly proved their worth by pulling off shocking upsets in the first round.
No. 63 Wang bounced back from a first-set loss to conquer the No. 3 player in the country, Ohio State’s Peter Kobelt, 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-3. Meanwhile, No. 80 Grant defeated No. 4 Ryan Lipman of Vanderbilt 7-5, 4-3, as Lipman was forced to retire with a hip injury.
These might have been the biggest wins of these Trojans’ careers so far, and Wang said the players’ mentality played a major role in the wins.
“I think belief was a huge factor,” Wang said. “I feel that as the match progressed, I believed that I could break his serve and win the match.”
Junior Roberto Quiroz, ranked No. 25 in the nation, also upset No. 12 Japie de Klerk from the University of Tulsa in the first round, with a score of 6-3, 6-1.
All three Trojans fell in the next round, but they showed great potential in taking down their higher-ranked opponents.
“Incredible effort by the guys. Great sign for the season,” the team’s official account tweeted.
Senior Ray Sarmiento, ranked No. 8 in the nation, advanced one round further than his teammates, earning a spot in the Round of 16. There he faced No. 17 Jared Hiltzik of Illinois, and was defeated, 6-2, 6-2.
Sarmiento reached the Round of 16 in last year’s ITA All-American Championships as well.
“I feel really good about my game going forward and into the season,” Sarmiento said. “As a team we had a couple good wins and hopefully these guys can build off of that, looks very positive the rest of the fall.”
Only one doubles team suited up for the tournament: Wang and sophomore Max de Vroome. The tandem enjoyed a first-round bye, but lost in the second qualifying round.
Freshmen Rob Bellamy and Nick Crystal traveled to San Diego for the weekend to compete in the Aztec Invitational. They impressed in their college debuts, as Bellamy captured the singles title and the duo earned the doubles championship together.
The women’s team also put on a show in doubles this weekend.
Surprisingly, though, it was not USC’s decorated duo of senior Kaitlyn Christian and junior Sabrina Santamaria who made a deep run in the women’s tournament. Rather, juniors Zoë Scandalis and Giuliana Olmos, who are ranked No. 54 in the nation together, advanced to the finals of the Riviera/ITA Women’s All-American Championships in Pacific Palisades, Calif.
The duo started off in the qualifying rounds and defeated seven teams to earn a spot in the finals, in which they fell 6-4, 6-2 to UCLA’s No. 20 Robin Anderson and Jennifer Brady.
Scandalis, who is ranked No. 17 in the nation in singles, was the only player to compete in the main draw on the singles side, but was bested in the first round by Texas A&M’s No. 48 Cristina Sancu.
Next up for the men’s team is the Battle of the Bay Classic in San Francisco from Oct. 11 to 13. The women will rest up and prepare for the ITA Southwest Regional Championships from Oct. 17-21 in San Diego.

You upset the supposedly  #3 and #4 players in the country then lose in the very next round. What happened to
their belief in the next round? It looks like three big upset winners were still dreaming of their big feat getting
thrashed in the next round. Tell me when Peter Smith can get his team to the finals without Steve Johnson and
Daniel Nguyen leading the way. He had four great years with them only.

As my friend and I were driving by campus last week, we were in a nostalgic mood, one common among college seniors. We were talking about “USC bucket list” items that we wanted to cross off in our last year as undergrads.
As we drove south on Figueroa past the Galen Center, my buddy laughed and said, “That’s one place I’ve never set foot in. I should probably go there at least once.”
When I heard that, it seemed pretty unbelievable. As a former beat writer for both USC’s men’s and women’s basketball teams as well as the women’s volleyball team, I have visited the Galen Center many times, both for games and practices.
The very first home volleyball game I attended as a beat writer in the spring of 2012 drew 5,385 fans — the most ever to attend a women’s volleyball match in the six-year history of the Galen Center.
But the more I thought about it, I remembered the struggles the teams that call Galen Center home have had in drawing enthusiastic supporters.
In February 2011, the women’s basketball team played an afternoon game against UCLA that I was covering as the Women of Troy’s beat writer. The Galen Center was quite a sight to behold — USC’s student section held no more than 10 students, while UCLA had brought over at least 40 students in powder blue to cheer their team on. Part of the lack of interest for that particular day could be explained by the fact that it was Super Bowl Sunday — but that made the Bruins’ show of support even more impressive.
UCLA won that game 74-67 and went on to earn a No. 3 seed in the NCAA Tournament. USC hovered on the bubble to make the tournament all season long but ended up being relegated to the Women’s National Invitational Tournament, where they streaked all the way to the championship game. If the Women of Troy had been able to snatch a few more regular season wins riding the support of a rowdy hometown crowd, who knows what could have happened? Maybe former coach Michael Cooper would still be employed by USC.
Of course, a buzzing crowd doesn’t always automatically bring success — in that aforementioned volleyball matchup, the first-ever Pac-12 volleyball game, the record crowd didn’t seem to positively affect the No. 9-ranked Women of Troy as they were handily swept by No. 8 UCLA.
In USC’s subsequent home game two weeks later against No. 1 Cal, just 1,411 fans witnessed the Women of Troy sweep the top-ranked Golden Bears. That number decreased to 1,309 in USC’s home match the next day, another impressive three-set victory against No. 2 Stanford.
It’s impossible to say if that first deflating defeat set a negative precedent for the 5,000-plus fans that came out that day, who were perhaps unaware that USC boasts one of the most prestigious and consistently competitive volleyball programs in the country.
But despite two solid campaigns in the past two years that have seen USC reach the NCAA semifinals and quarterfinals, respectively, the team hasn’t replicated the gaudy attendance figure set in the inaugural Pac-12 match.
For the second straight year, USC’s attendance figures when UCLA came to visit the Galen Center decreased. On September 25, No. 4 USC defeated UCLA 3-1 in front of a crowd of 2,479, which has been the high point of the season thus far. Entering Sunday’s match against Cal, the Women of Troy had averaged 1,734 fans — not bad, but not great considering the team is ranked No. 2 in the nation and has already had marquee matchups against UCLA and Stanford.
As I racked my brain to find some reason behind this mystery, I realized that I haven’t been to Galen Center very often as a fan. The truth is, in my three-plus years as a Trojan, I’ve only sat in the student section four times — three times for men’s basketball games, and once for the men’s volleyball championship two springs ago. So maybe I’m part of the problem.
But for those like my friend who have never entered Galen Center as a USC fan, I highly encourage you to give it a try. It’s a beautiful arena that’s hosted numerous conference tournaments, Los Angeles Clipper practices and the Kids Choice Awards. Any school would love to own a similar venue.
And with the way the football team has been playing, chances are that if you don’t want to sit out in the sun and catch a men’s water polo game, the Galen Center hosts USC’s best shot at a championship squad this fall.

The USC men’s water polo team defeated the visiting UC Irvine Anteaters 18-7 on Saturday within the friendly confines of Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
Scoring burst · Senior utility player Mace Rapsey led the Trojans with five goals on Saturday in their conference opener against the Anteaters. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
The Trojans entered the game ranked second in the nation and did nothing but help themselves ranking wise with a decisive win over the No. 9 Anteaters.
The key to the game for USC was a strong surge coming out of the gate led by a pair of  seniors from Australia, two-meter Jeremy Davie and utility man Mace Rapsey. The two of them paired up with senior standout driver Nikola Vavic to put the Trojans up 7-0 early on in the contest.
Irvine responded with a pair of goals before the end of the first half, putting them at a 9-2 disadvantage heading into the last half of the game.
The Trojans came out strong however, and opened the third with three straight goals, including Rapsey’s fifth of the day, giving him 99 in his career as a Trojan. The Anteaters would not go down easy, but senior goalie James Clark made enough stops late to seal the Trojan’s 13th victory of the year.
Clark played the entirety of the contest, marking one of the first games of the season in which head coach Jovan Vavic did not use a goalie by committee approach, which gives sophomore Aleck Ryner and junior Paul Mitre a chance in goal.
Rapsey led all Trojans with five goals, followed by a four-goal performance from the highly underrated junior Kostas Genidounias. Genidounias was USC’s second leading scorer last year as a sophomore, when he tallied 68 scores, which was good enough for the fifth-best mark of single season goals all-time.
The Athens, Greece native is also renowned as one of the best defensive players for the Trojans, and was second on the team in steals last year with 37. His play this year has not dropped off a bit, as he quietly has been a steady contributor for the Trojans as they attempt to win their sixth straight national championship.
The match against Irvine was the Trojans first game in conference play, putting them at 1-0 in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference play, and 13-1 overall.
The next action for the impressive squad will occur at the SoCal Tournament. The Trojans suffered their first loss of the season two weeks ago at the sister tournament, the NorCal Tournament. The loss in the championship game of the tournament against the crosstown rival UCLA Bruins marked the end of the NCAA-best 41 game winning streak .
Still, the team responded with three straight victories at home, the first two against a tough Princeton Tigers squad as well as the Whittier Poets last weekend and obviously this most recent victory against a top-ranked UC Irvine squad.
This next weekend will also be important for the younger Vavic, who is six goals away from taking over as USC’s all-time scoring leader. Coach Vavic’s son and one of USC’s most prolific water polo players currently clocks in at 215 goals, just five behind the immortal Olympian Juraj Zatovic who scored 220 during his four years as a Trojan.
The Trojans first contest of the SoCal Tournament will come on Saturday Oct. 12 against St. Francis from New York at 8 A.M. followed by a contest against the winner of Long Beach State versus LMU. The results of the two matchups for Saturday will determine who and when the Trojans play on Sunday. The tournament will be held in Irvine, Calif.

The USC women’s volleyball team was pushed to the limit by its Northern California rivals but triumphed both times, turning back Stanford and Cal to stretch their winning streak to eight games.
Unstoppable · Freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwabenu, a two-time Pac-12 Freshman of the Week honoree, led all players with 13 kills on Friday against Stanford before recording a team-high 21 kills on Sunday versus Cal. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy defeated the Cardinal Friday night 3-0 (25-21, 25-15, 27-25) to end Stanford’s own eight-match winning streak and give USC coach Mick Haley his 1,100th career victory. They were pushed to a grueling five sets Sunday against the Bears but emerged victorious, winning 3-2 (28-26, 22-25, 25-11, 18-25, 15-13) to improve to 14-1 and remain unbeaten (4-0) in Pac-12 play.
“We started planning in the middle of the fourth set for a possibility of a fifth set against Cal,” head coach Mick Haley said. “I thought our seniors were great. They were focused and never got too excited or down. They stayed with it when they got their opportunities.”
The Women of Troy recorded 17 kills in the first set to down the Cardinal 25-21. Freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu and sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio recorded four kills apiece while senior libero Natalie Hagglund notched eight digs. Senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard blocked a Stanford strike to seal the first frame 25-21.
USC applied the pressure in the second frame and won handily 25-15. The Women of Troy stormed out to a 15-8 lead and never looked back, going up 20-11 on a kill from senior outside hitter Sara Shaw and finishing the set on a kill from junior middle blocker Hannah Schraer.
The Cardinal looked to be running away with the third set after jumping out on top 18-11, but USC put together a thrilling comeback to take a 22-20 lead. A strong left-side kill by Nwanebu gave USC match point, but Stanford recovered to tie it 24-24. The Women of Troy ended any further drama, however, as back-to-back Stanford errors concluded the set 27-25 and the 1,100th career victory for Haley.
“You always have a goal going in of beating a team 3-0, and Stanford’s always a team that will bring their best,” Shaw said. “We’re excited that we beat them 3-0 especially after coming back in that third game.”
USC faced stiff competition from Cal to open the match — neither team built a lead of more than a couple of points. The Bears negated a USC set point at 24-22 and sparked a rally to go up 26-25 and put USC on its heels. After a timeout, Nwanebu took the set into her own hands, knocking down consecutive kills to restore USC’s match point at 27-26. Bricio ended the rally with a serve down the middle that Cal couldn’t handle, securing the first set 28-26.
The second set remained tight, with the two teams playing to a 13-13 tie. Cal pulled away to lead 19-16 and then 24-21 to bring up set point. USC couldn’t muster a rally this time, however, as a right-sight kill gave the Bears the set 25-22 and tied the match 1-1.
The Women of Troy recovered after the break, jumping ahead 11-7 on a Schraer kill to force a Cal timeout. Nwanebu knocked down back-to-back strikes and USC later went up by as much as 17-8 to force another Bears timeout. Back-to-back kills by junior outside hitter Emily Young and Olgard put USC up 24-11 before a Cal service error put the Women of Troy ahead 2-1 in the match.
The Bears turned the table on the hosts in the fourth set, going up 11-7 and winning the set 25-18 to become the first opponent to push USC to a fifth set this season. The Women of Troy saw their 10-5 lead  evaporate as the Bears stormed back to tie it at 13-all in the deciding frame, but Olgard knocked down consecutive kills from the middle to seal the set 15-13 and put an end to a thrilling match.
Though the players spoke to the importance of getting a five-set match under their belts, Haley emphasized the need to reduce attacking errors to avoid reaching a tiebreaker in the first place.
“I think Cal slowed us down to a walk and we couldn’t get any intensity off them,” Haley said. “Not being able to generate any energy kept Cal close and we made more hitting errors tonight than we’ve made in a long time. We also kept them in the match with our serving errors.”
The Women of Troy will hit the road for the next four matches, beginning with a Friday night match against Oregon State.
Three Stars of the weekend:
3rd star: Samantha Bricio (27 kills, five aces)
2nd star: Alexis Olgard (24 kills, including game-winner against Cal)
1st star: Ebony Nwanebu (34 kills, .459 hitting percentage against Cal)
Nwanebu notched a team-high 21 kills against the Bears and hit .459. She also led all players Friday with 13 kills.
Olgard dropped nine kills and five blocks against Stanford before an impressive 15 kills Sunday against Cal. She hit above .500 both times and sealed the win Sunday with consecutive kills.
Bricio registered 27 kills in the two matches and also knocked down five service aces to continue her tear through the Pac-12.

The ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives is collaborating with Project Suicide Prevention Intervention Now (SPIN) in a partnership to develop a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-inclusive curriculum in high schools.
History in magazines · Various editions are organized on a wall of the ONE archive for teachers to incorporate in their curriculums. The goal of the collaboration is to educate students about LGBT history. – Jasmine Rolle | Daily Trojan
The ONE archives, which are affiliated with USC, include the world’s largest research library on LGBTQ history and interests.
The ONE archives contain collections ranging from personal papers by activists, books, periodicals, art, photography and posters. The ONE archives are also a part of USC’s digital library, which includes audio and video recordings as well as visual media.
The ONE organization itself started in 1952  as a magazine. In 2000, it moved into its current building on West Adams Boulevard. In October 2010, the ONE Archives became a part of USC Libraries.
SPIN is an organization that works directly with the Los Angeles Unified School District in order to support LGBT students by strengthening the tie between different programs throughout Los Angeles County.
Jamie Scot, the project and development manager to the ONE National Gay and Lesbian Archives, said the idea of the project is to fill in the holes of classes that leave LGBT people out of history.
“Researchers are taking textbooks and mirroring them with our own curriculum, which is very similar to what teachers are teaching in regular history classes,” Scot said.
The collaboration will provide an in-depth curriculum change based on history from 1940 to the present. The ONE archives will provide resources for the curriculum. Teachers will have the opportunity to use the new material and incorporate them into the curriculum they currently use.
“We have our own history and people who have contributed to history but are gay and books never mention them,” Scot said.
Other projects that collaborate with the archives include the independent non-profit organization ONE. It functions in conjunction with the ONE archives at USC.
“Both ‘ONE’ organizations function side by side, however, they are independent of each other,” said Loni Shibuyama, an archivist at the ONE archives.
Many students were excited about the new project. Eliza Asherian, a senior majoring in biological sciences, believes teaching LGBTQ history in the school system is an opportunity to further equality.
“I think this is beneficial because it definitely promotes equality among all people, something that should be reflected throughout history textbooks,” Asherian said.
Others see both benefits and drawbacks in the new program.
“One part of me wants to say that this will help and that everyone should have someone to look up to and then the other part of me says, why should people have to be defined by these groups?” Edwin To, a senior majoring in theater, said. “Why can’t they just be seen for their achievements?”

USC Transportation is striving to make more parking spaces available at a reasonable price for students, faculty and guests.
People who do purchase a permit are faced with a cost as low as $58.50 to as high as $414 per semester, all which are relative to the parking structure and whether the driver is in a motorcycle or a car.
Each semester is roughly four and a half months, meaning the monthly rate falls between $13 to $92. If a driver uses his or her car at least five times per month, the driver’s monthly permit is probably less expensive than paying to park on a daily basis.
USC Transportation Associate Director of Operations David Donovan explained the logistics.
“We have eight parking structures and numerous open-air surface lots across both campuses, as well as garage parking and surface lots associated with USC Housing facilities. There are around 15,000 spaces available,” Donovan said.
Donovan also addressed how USC keeps permit rates as low as they can, while still contributing to the University-approved budget.
“We operate on a zero-based budget system; we can only spend what we generate in revenue in a given fiscal year,” Donovan said.
For those students who live off campus in an apartment, most of those complexes provide deals for car parking.
Last year, the apartment complex Lorenzo had promotions for free parking if students signed a lease with them at certain times of the year.
Rachel Erickson, a senior majoring in global health, lives in Chez Ronnee, which had two parking spots included in the rent. Erickson said if she and her roommates needed more than two spaces, she would be reluctant to look into street parking.
“I know many people who’ve been towed or had the car vandalized on the street,” Erickson said.
Others avoid street parking because it can be hard to find. Commuter Kaeli Flaczinski, a senior majoring in astronautical engineering, pays $414 per semester for a parking permit.
“It is insane to find a parking spot on the street,” Flaczinski said. “I do not necessarily mean [the permit] is worth it.”
Donovan mentioned how accommodating USC has been for students commuting to campus.
“Commuter students who bring their vehicles to campus have the same privileges residential students do,” Donovan said. “Students who use alternate forms of transit are supported by our various alternate commuting options, including carpool and vanpool programs, subsidies for discounted Metro permits and partnerships with programs like Zimride and Zipcar.”
The hassle of finding parking off campus is one reason students are buying parking permits for on-campus parking.
“If I had all the time in the world to search for street parking, I would, but honestly it’s just easier to have a set place to park that I’ve already paid for,” Erickson said.

The USC Department of Public Safety last week released its Annual Campus Security and Fire Safety Report, which made adjustments for forcible sex offenses, not noted in the previous year’s report.
The report, which covers three years of campus crime statistics, noted that in 2011 there were 14 incidences of forcible sexual offenses on campus and nine in residential facilities. The original report said there were only seven incidences of sexual offenses off campus and five in residential facilities.
The report also noted seven incidences of forcible sexual offenses on campus in 2010 and three in residential facilities. The original only reported five forcible sex offenses on-campus and two in residential facilities. The 2012 annual security report noted only seven forcible sex offenses on campus and five in residential facilities on a subset of campus.
In a statement released on DPS’ website, Chief John Thomas said that “the corrections for sex offenses … were due, respectively, to a self-initiated internal review and to additional information from the Los Angeles Police Department.”
The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act requires college campuses to “[document] three calendar years of select campus crime statistics including security policies and procedures and information on the basic rights guaranteed victims of sexual assault,” according to the Clery Center’s website.
According to Thomas’ statement, “The Clery Act allows an exemption for reports made to counselors [such as those at the USC Center for Women and Men] so as to provide students a safe haven” even if they do not wish to report the incident.
“Our reporting procedures for those years did not state that the counseling center was exempt from reporting to DPS,” Thomas said in the statement. “Therefore all of the complaints should have been counted by DPS and made public as part of our Clery Act numbers.”
Still, junior international relations major Francesca Bessey, herself a rape survivor, is concerned that the error in the security report is evidence of a lack of acknowledgment by the university to address the problem of sexual violence on campus.
“A statistical acknowledgement of the issue goes hand in hand with a more general acknowledgement of the issue and that it’s a problem that happens here and a problem that happens everywhere,” Bessey said. “Without that basic precedent set by acknowledging the issue, you’re not going to be able to talk about the issue openly, honestly and comfortably.”
Earlier this year, the university administration determined that effective Oct. 1, staff of the Center for Women and Men, which provides counseling for victims of sexual assault, will no longer be designated as Campus Security Authorities, the title given to entities that can file official reports of sexual assault.
In a statement on their website, the center said that “referring a victim to the Center for Women and Men does not satisfy the requirement of submitting an incident report form. In addition to referring the victim (if known) to the Center for Women and Men, the CSA also must submit the Incident Report Form to DPS.”
Though Bessey said she recognizes that the administration might have aimed to increase students’ feeling of safety and anonymity when they go to the center, she felt concerned that making reporting sexual assault more difficult could perpetuate victims’ denial of their assault.
“There’s a reason calling 911 is easy,” Bessey said. “No one can undo what happened and [it] can’t undo that it’s going to be hard for someone but to make it harder doesn’t help. You actively discourage people from seeking on-campus resources either because you don’t advertise them or you make the process extremely difficult and potentially even traumatizing.”
Even prior to the administration’s decision, Bessey said her experience with reporting sexual assault was difficult.
“When I was sexually assaulted as a freshman, I didn’t have any idea at all what kind of resources were available to me, and after I got over the initial period of shock and denial, I was almost immediately discouraged from doing anything about it,” she said. “By that time, I’d already heard a lot of people express their frustrations with going through the reporting process and there wasn’t much that made it seem worthwhile.”
The university gained national media attention last May when 16 students and alumni submitted a Title IX complaint to the Office for Civil Rights within the Department of Education regarding USC’s treatment of sexual assault victims and errors in its reporting and adjudication process.
According to senior theater major Alexa Schwartz, who is one of three students whose complaints are currently under investigation by the Office for Civil Rights, the complaint was written with the help of an organization called End Rape on Campus.
Schwartz said that while USC claims not to tolerate sexual assault and rape, the complicated reporting process leaves students unsure of what to do.
“This is a major dilemma across the nation about what you’re supposed to do not just when you’re sexually assaulted or raped but when you hear about it,” she said. “Are you supposed to tell the police or are you supposed to provide immediate emotional support to the person telling you? Are those things mutually exclusive?”
Schwartz went to DPS in August of this year to find out if the Center for Women and Men had given them information about her incident. DPS had no record of her file. She remains uncertain if her assault was included in the revised campus safety report numbers.

USC’s Latino Student Assembly, School of Cinematic Arts and Political Student Assembly kicked off the weekend with a series of Mexican film screenings paired with panel discussions called “The Renaissance of Mexican Film and Soft Power.”
Opening eyes · Panelists discuss prominent Mexican films and their role in Mexican culture on Saturday at the Ray Stark Family Theatre in the George Lucas Building. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The event was part of National Hispanic Heritage Month, which is takes place from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15. The goal of the screenings and discussions were to explore film as a medium of understanding political power in Mexico. More specifically, the event highlighted “soft power,” which describes the ways that a country can seduce and attract power in contrast to using coercion.
Recently in Hollywood, films such as Amores Perros, and Y Tu Mamá También have created narratives that usually concern drug wars and those who migrate for economic reasons, offering a multiple perspectives on Mexico.
“I believe that by doing something visual and bringing that to people, they sort of learn more about the culture and all that Mexico has to offer,” said Samantha Galaz, a junior majoring in international relations.
According to Latino Student Assembly Executive Director Valerie Fernandez, “[The event] ushered this great idea to bring Mexican cinema that revolutionized the way people saw a mixture of the politics, the myths about drug wars and the structure of Mexican society in recent years.”
Fernandez said the aim of the event was to point out that more social barriers exist within Mexico than people might initially perceive.
“One thing we saw through the cinema, specifically, was that Mexico doesn’t have one face,” Fernandez said. “I think yesterday, during a movie called Nosotros Los Nobles, we took a look at how, taking it way back, there was division between the European conquerors and Mexicans. You still see that today, and that’s something that we definitely wanted to highlight. Having people who aren’t familiar with Mexican culture realize that there are many faces and many issues intertwined within many social divisions even within Mexico is our goal.”
On Friday night, films including Nosotros Los Nobles were shown, followed by a Q&A with Gaz Alazraki, the film’s writer, director and producer who graduated from the USC School of Cinematic Arts in 2001. The film is about a successful construction mogul, Herman Noble, who decides to teach his spoiled kids a lesson. His directorial debut has become the highest grossing Mexican film of all time in Mexico.
The panel discussed topics that provoked widely different opinions among the panelists and the discussion became very heated. The fiscal policies of the Mexican government were prominent subjects during the discussions.
Many audience members said they were inspired by different aspects of each film.
Latino Student Assembly Director of Political Affairs Andrea Guisela, a junior majoring in international relations (global business), said that the event made her realize that discrimination still exists today.
“I’m reminded that there is racism within cultures. If you’re lighter skinned, have blonde hair and have light eyes, that signifies wealth. Anything else is not. It’s more indigenous,” Guisela said. “It’s supposed to be more lower classes and it’s a reminder that racism doesn’t only exist in America. It exists within [other] cultures as well.”

The fourth annual IndieCade took place in Culver City this weekend. The convention brought together independent game developers to share their work and provide an idea of where the independent gaming industry is headed over the next few years. IndieCade also provided an opportunity for attendees to try out upcoming releases that aren’t given the publicity of more mainstream franchises.
IndieCade was home to more than 150 games, including 36 that were nominated by the IndieCade Jury for awards. These games were hooked up to a variety of mediums, ranging from newer, more advanced consoles such as the Ouya, Wii U, PlayStation 4 and Oculus VR, to portable systems such as the Nintendo 3DS and PS Vita. Various games were even played throughout the event on arcade machines or in massive virtual-reality simulators.
There were also tents and events set up to help aspiring game developers learn different software and business strategies that are commonly used in the industry. Seminars included development for the upcoming Xbox One, team management and networking. Also helpful for developers were tents set up to give attendees crash courses in programs such as Unity and the Unreal Engine.
Some games added bold new features to set it apart from other software, while others hearkened back to the art and gameplay of classic games and still others pushed the boundaries of what can be achieved in a video game. The common emotion that ran through all the games’ designers and developers was a pure passion for games, something that can get lost under the creative bulwark of marketability.
Freeq, made by USC faculty members, is a story-based audio adventure game for iOS and Android, focusing on the interaction between two characters. The player can locate different characters by tilting his mobile device. By tapping the icon for that character, you have the option to select a character for that person to talk to. This initiates a phone conversation between the two characters, introducing dialogue and conflict between them. In case you want to revisit the conversations, the interactions are accessible with just one touch, allowing you to get the entire story.
Many of the games created by USC students and alumniwere reperesentative of games at IndieCade. These include nominated games [code] and Nidhogg, as well as Project Holodeck, Gib Gods and Outer Wilds.
[code] is a single-player puzzle game where users play as an “@” in a level’s code, and they’re tasked with fixing the code using the “@” to get through the level. The game is especially appealing to people interested in computer science, as the game helps teach basic principles. Nidhogg is a two-player fencing game, with the winner getting the “honor” of being eaten by a giant worm.
Project Holodeck is intended to bring virtual reality into a fun and accessible platform for gamers. Gib Gods is a chaotic side-scrolling multiplayer shooter, where up to four players can blast each other with rocket launchers. Outer Wilds is a first-person space exploration game, giving players 20 minutes to explore before the universe ends, which requires multiple play-throughs for one to truly appreciate what the game has to offer.
The event serves as a smaller, more accessible alternative to the Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3. IndieCade instead focuses on more creative game ideas and relatively unknown companies rather than triple-A releases and new installments in well-known franchises such as Call of Duty and Assassin’s Creed.
It’s free to anyone, and is easy to get to from the USC campus. A majority of the games have no wait time, whereas other games, such as those on the Oculus Rift, require a brief wait in line. The waits are much shorter than those at an event like E3, allowing for much more playing time.
“It’s an amazing thing,” said Scott Den Adel, senior design at LOOT Entertainment, which showed off its Forsaken Planet game at IndieCade. “I was at the IndieCade Tasting the other night with the other developers, and it’s such a joy to see all these people who had original ideas and started up their dream game. I think it’s really where the industry’s moving, towards games that people really want to make and really want to play.”
Attendees could also try out the new Playstation 4 controller, as well as test out the Ouya, Android’s competition to the PS4, Xbox One and Wii U which has been out since June. Though the PS4 controller felt comfortable and natural for playing different types of games (first-person shooter, fighting and platformer were all tested), the Ouya controller felt weird to hold, not matching up to the comfort of other current generation controllers.
“This is only my second year going, but it’s definitely expanded this year: It not only takes more space, but the space is also packed in a lot more tightly,” said TJ Darcy, a junior studying computer science (games) and president of USC’s Makers of Enet. “In addition, there seem to be a lot more sponsors this year; big companies like Nintendo and Sony showing up to give their support to indie devs, and encourage people to publish on their platforms.”
IndieCade is an experience that shows the lighter side of the gaming industry. The games don’t have the kind of publicity of those found in bigger festivals, but IndieCade continues to close the gap by getting some of the giants of gaming to support independent studios. The obvious passion of the developers, as well as the other attendees, helps make it a worthwhile experience for those who enjoy playing games. It’ll be interesting to see how the new consoles handle independent development, but if this year’s IndieCade is any indication, there’s a lot to be excited about in non-traditional gaming.

Two years after the release of its last studio album, Panic! at the Disco is back with more eccentricities than ever, ready to delight eardrums with its modern disco in its latest album, Too Weird To Live, Too Rare To Die!, in addition to adapting new personas for themselves. Long gone are the days of top hats and red conductor coats — the boys are now dressed in slick, lavish suits and return with its never-ending energy and enthusiasm.
“Nicotine” · Panic! at the Disco’s latest album Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die! is a catchy, addictive collection of 10 pop-rock tracks. — Courtesy of Panic! at the Disco
Best known for their 2006 hit single, “I Write Sins Not Tragedies,” off of the band’s debut album A Fever You Can’t Sweat Out, Panic! shot into rapid fame, exciting the teenage population with its theatrics, witty lyrics and boyish charm. Fresh out of high school, the boys’ creativity in its costuming and concepts led to their rise in popularity. But even with the band’s success, the band has had their fair share of drama with a fallout between members, temporarily dropping the exclamation mark from the band’s name and a brief hiatus. Also, it would be better if everyone pretended Pretty. Odd. never happened.
Regardless, the band bounced back in 2011, with a new lineup sans two of the original members, exclamation mark reinstated and its single “Ready To Go” with its third album, Vices & Virtues. To many fans’ delight, the album was reminiscent of the band’s original sound.
As for the band’s latest album, the two new singles, “This Is Gospel” and “Miss Jackson” (also the first two tracks on the album), begin the narrative by stripping down to raw vocals and overpowering drum lines, casting away the theatricality that was once a specialty of the Las Vegas natives. The songs sound darker and heavier than ones usually associated with the band, though they still retaining a slight upbeat feeling.
The rest of the songs on the album sound like an experiment between disco-inspired techno and alternative pop rock, while still maintaining the band’s signature strong vocals. As odd as it sounds, it works well on both “Vegas Lights” and “Collar Full.” The tracks have a definite foot-tapping and head-nodding quality about them.
Then comes “Girl That You Love,” a dark track that puts listeners on the edge of their seats with a sense of slight discomfort. An eerie, vocoder-like voice spouts lyrics such as, “Drop every pretense / Drown every sense you own / For the girl that you love,” as cheesy Rick Astley-esque drums and percussion play under them. The retro feel of the track falls flat and the song fails to impress, lacking the usual lyrical sophistication because of its repetitive chorus.
Another weaker point on the album is “Girls/Girls/Boys,” which lightly touches on a character’s struggle with being bisexual. The bisexual character is portrayed through a straight man’s perspective, who tries to help his bisexual female friend keep her sexuality private. Lead singer Brendon Urie croons “love is not a choice” and “… you’ve gotta save your reputation / They’re close to finding out about your girlfriend.” Though the lyrics portray a lack of awareness about bisexuality through the male character’s perspective (reminiscent of tracks from Fever), the song itself has a lackluster melody and is not up to par with the rest of the album.
No need to panic · Panic! at the Disco frontman Brendon Urie has seen many changes over the years, but the band’s unique sound remains. — Courtesy of Amy Willard
What the album lacks in some songs, it definitely makes up for in others. “Casual Affair” brings in a fresh track that sounds like an electronic version of Marilyn Manson meeting a dramatic string ensemble (if such a crossover were ever to exist) and is absolutely smashing. “Nicotine” creates a fixation “worse than nicotine” in the form of a club banger. With its explosive vocals and insane house beats, as well as catchy hooks and powerful guitar riffs, listeners will find it hard to sit still through the track. “The End Of All Things,” the last track on the album, is a soft ballad that sends a chill down your spine, yet manages to wrap up the intensity of the album with a calming melody.
Despite being a short, 10-track album, Too Weird To Live, Too Rare to Die! transports listeners into the world of electro pop-rock and provides an energetic listening experience. Filled with prominent drum lines, heavy guitar riffs and catchy synths, the album definitely feels different from their past work, yet still manages to retain the pizzazz Panic! is known for. With an album titled Too Weird To Live, Too Rare to Die!, expecting the unexpected is the only way to go while listening to this one.

Not all hip-hop is a fusion of raunchy remarks and bombastic beats (though I will admit that I enjoy E-40’s “Tell Me When To Go” more than your average 19-year-old). Many contemporary hip-hop artists have discovered creative methods to blend elements of other genres such as pop, reggae and acoustic music to create rich, wholesome productions.
If you’re looking for a break from the conventional hip-hop playlist composed of mainstream acts like Lil’ Wayne, this one’s for you.

“Paint” — Sol
Seattle-based musician Sol Moravia-Rosenberg — known as just “Sol” — couldn’t have titled this song more appropriately. “Paint” is a work of art. It’s great for both an impromptu dance party or an energetic homework session. The track is dynamic from the start, but perhaps most commendable are Sol’s lyrics — they’re succinct, yet memorable: “‘Bout to turn a dream to a million / But we don’t chase cream / So we feed it to the children.”
“Fame is For A–holes” — Hoodie Allen
Instead of writing a paper worth 25 percent of my grade, one night during my freshman year I chose to attend a Hoodie Allen concert. The El Rey was swarming with gum-smacking, curfew-breaking 16-year-olds. My academic responsibilities hung over me like a dark cloud. Despite my feelings of guilt, I had one of the best nights of my college career. Hoodie Allen’s charisma and love for the stage translated into a thrilling concert experience, and after that night, I went from being a casual listener to a true Hoodie fan. Admittedly, Hoodie Allen’s music is not exactly as intelligent as his background: Though Steve Markowitz, a.k.a. Hoodie Allen, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and worked for Google, his lyrics typically focus on taking a woman’s clothes off. This track is from Hoodie Allen’s 2013 album, Crew Cuts, and features the popular recording artist Chiddy Bang.
“Floats my Boat” — Aer
David von Mering and Carter Schultz, hailing from the beautiful state of Massachusetts, look as good as their music sounds. These two handsome gentlemen create melodies with an earthy, beachy tone — it’s the kind of music you want to listen to as you cruise PCH with your windows down and sunroof open.
“All Night Longer” — Sammy Adams
Comparable to the sounds of Asher Roth, 26-year-old Sammy Adams is best known for the radio-hit “L.A. Story.” His lesser-known, 2012 release, “All Night Longer” is equally as impressive and ridiculously catchy. When the chorus drops, it’s hard not to sing along: “Tell that bartender, make that motherf-cker stronger / I wanna go all night longer.”
“Lady Killers” — G-Eazy
Don’t worry. The title of this track is misleading. Unlike Eminem, who rapped, “B-tch Ima kill you / You don’t want to f-ck with me,” so passionately that half of America was convinced he was going to turn out to be a homicidal maniac, good ole Gerald Gillum is simply talking about how he’s the ultimate ladies’ man.
G-Eazy earned his music industry studies degree from Loyola University and collaborates with artists such as Hoodie Allen, Mod Sun and Devon Baldwin to consistently bring imaginative hip-hop tracks to the music industry. Give the rest of his album a listen, and it will become clear that G-Eazy is quite the intelligent man who can rap about topics other than drugs and alcohol.
“Swoon” — Timeflies
“Electro Hip-Pop     Dub-Something.” That’s the self-proclaimed genre of Cal Shapiro and Rob Resnick, the duo behind Timeflies. This duo shot to fame with the help of YouTube. Like many of the aforementioned artists, Cal Shapiro is well-educated: He earned his degree from Tufts University. Since then, he has been performing at colleges across the country.
“Cool and Calm” and “Are We There Yet” — Dumbfoundead 
Dumbfoundead is the moniker of Los Angeles native Jonathan Park. His story is as refreshing as his music: Born to a South Korean couple in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Park migrated to our very own Koreatown at a young age. His meaningful wordplay in “Are We There Yet” tells his remarkable life story: “Mamma had a dream, but she gave it up for me / And my sister raising kids, man that ain’t a cup of tea / Got herself a job, an apartment and a car / But the struggle isn’t over so I keep doing my parts.”

Dumbfounded and Sammy Adams needs to collaborate with the rising star Cris Cab. Hopefully both of them have seen this video he released with Pharrell.

Superficially, the subject matter in Alfonso Cuarón’s Gravity is not especially original. Movies such as Solaris, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Apollo 13 deal with the challenges facing astronauts in space. Gravity focuses on two astronauts, played by George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, and the pair’s struggle to survive after disaster strikes during a Hubble Space Telescope repair mission. As the captivating trailers for Gravity show, their routine spacewalk repair of the satellite is suddenly hit by a devastating cloud of debris transforming the routine into a disaster.
No air · Sandra Bullock plays Dr. Ryan Stone in Gravity, an intense thriller about a Hubble Space Telescope repair expedition that goes awry. Bullock’s performance draws the audience in and elevates the tension of the film. – Courtesy of Warner Bros. Press
Murphy’s law has a field day in this film — everything that could possibly go wrong, does, often in quick succession. The astronauts are constantly at odds with the utterly inhospitable environment around them as they fight to survive. In the main scene from the trailers, Bullock’s character gets knocked off the shuttle and finds herself spinning off into a darkness threatening to swallow her whole. Intercutting agoraphobic shots of Bullock shrinking into the formless void of space and another from her point of view where bewildering, weightless spinning inside her claustrophobic helmet frames her flight away from her shuttle, Bullock’s terror is palpable and her performance is gripping throughout the film.
Despite Bullock’s powerful performance, however, space and its lack of gravity are the real stars of this film. They are the source of both the film’s terror and its stunning beauty. That terror arises from not only the enveloping nothingness, but also the sheer unpredictability of the environment. One would think that an environment whose primary characteristic is emptiness would not exhibit such volatility, but it is that emptiness, of not only objects, but also rules that makes it so much more alien than any alien planet visited in the realm of movies. Where a planet will have new and strange characteristics, the emptiness of space, and its absence of gravity or frame of reference, blows it out of the water when it comes to unfamiliarity.
In Gravity, the monster is the emptiness — be it the constant threat it poses to the astronaut’s shuttle or the threat of getting lost in its black endlessness. This high-wire act of balancing the fears from wide-open spaces colors the succession of disasters that befall the astronauts and it makes for a very capable catalyst for the story’s progression.
The movie’s title alone should tip you off on the film’s focus on gravity or, more accurately, its absence. That weightlessness dominates the action. But it also gives the film a majestic quality. Using 3-D with a virtuosity that other directors have not been able to achieve, Cuarón uses the lack of gravity to create a weightless ballet in the midst of that constant visceral action. The movements of Bullock and Clooney, floating serenely at first and then with a calmness that belies the urgency of their crisis, are by far the most important part of their performances, despite the stellar job they did with the actual dialogue and desperation. Hanging from super thin wires inside of a state-of-the-art LED cube, they simulated weightlessness marvelously. The movement’s contrast with the urgency of the situation is marvelous, especially with incredible shots of the earth and stars filling the field of vision on a theater screen. In one scene, time is running out. Bullock counts down her oxygen levels as they try to get to the station “3 percent … 2 percent …. 1 percent …” this is a criminally tense moment, but Cuarón splices it with an arresting view of the Earth at night behind them.
This is what makes the film an instant classic. Amid the chaos, amid the struggle, amid the rabid fight for life, you see such serene splendor that it is hard not to be swept up in it. In the same way the amazing desert shots in Lawrence of Arabia take your breath away between scenes of war and conflict, so does this incredible depiction of space. David Lean, the director of Lawrence, achieved his magnum opus by actually going to Jordan and filming in the desert. Cuarón was not lucky enough to go into orbit for his film. That, however, almost makes his achievement more amazing: the knowledge that with movie magic he was able to create such a striking depiction of space.
It is very easy to drift into superlatives and call a movie of Gravity’s caliber “great” for several paragraphs without really delving into the reasons why you think so. The film is a gripping, mesmerizing cinematic experience that is unlike any other film I have seen. Simply put, it is a masterpiece. Watch it on the biggest screen you can find, preferably in 3-D, and prepare to have your breath taken away.

Saw 3D IMAX version last evening….Amazing and Gripping film. One of the ways I have always (40 years of watching American films in theatres) used to judge whether a film is able to grip and move an audience is whether sudden movements, or emotional scenes and technical realism feel real…and cause me to get “caught up” in the story and forget that the actors are “celebrities”…in other words-forget the technical details, forget the personal life story of the actor.
This happened in this film in the first 15 minutes. this has not often happened in my life of watching films. I am an educated cinema professional and fell into the magic of this film almost immediately.
This is a winner.

Regarding the government shutdown
The Republican Party is rightfully concerned with the efficacy, fairness and practicability of the Affordable Care Act. Contrary to reports by popular news, the Republican Party does not own the shutdown. Such action takes two parts, two chambers of Congress. The Republican Party only controls one.
Sadly, the public will not hear the media report that after the shutdown occurred, a Democratic House representative urged her colleagues to not vote in favor of a Republican proposal to end the shutdown at that moment. Approximately 20 minutes later, Republicans made clear that they wished to keep the government open during negotiations, but Democrats did not respond. In fact, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid stated earlier that day that he would “not go to conference with a gun to [his] head!” Around 10 p.m. Republicans voted to end the shutdown. The Senate has yet to respond.
And, while many point to the Tea Party as a radical, extremist wing, we urge people to reconsider the image that has been carefully constructed from sound bites in the media. Not all Tea Party protestors on the streets are fully representative of the Republican Party. Yet, what the Tea Party and Congressional Republicans have in common is a well-founded concern about the direction of the largesse of our government.
This is not the first time the public hears about this complaint. In this case, it refers to the fact that Obamacare is indeed bad public policy. The Wall Street Journal has adequately chronicled a series of objective analyses of the overhaul. In it, we find that: It is more expensive for low-wage earners to enroll than to pay the penalty, as their costs are projected to double or triple; that small businesses cannot afford to hire, provide overtime or even keep a normal work week; very few insurance companies are able to participate in each state and there are insufficient economic incentives for the young to enroll to be able to offset the cost for older enrollees.
In what spanned a 1,000-page, unread document passed by reconciliation vote (a rule that made it possible to pass without any Republican votes), the President did not realize that the solution could have been made through much simpler means. True, market-based solutions could have been achieved by allowing insurance to be sold across state lines, ending pre-existing condition discrimination and increased use of health savings accounts. HSAs actually allow individuals to save money and borrow from it when needed for future medical expenses.
This law is not an American solution. It is neither a worldly solution, for it does not necessarily operate better than existing nationalized health care plans in other nations. It is a form of price fixation; it tells insurance companies that when insuring an increased number of people, they may only account for a limited number of variables. An entry-level economics course will tell us that does not make us better off. It increases premiums and unfairly ties the financial ability to hedge risks. It does not even incentivize preventive measures for a healthier, more fulfilling lifestyle to lower burden on the new system. It is only a bandage fix.
The truth of the matter is that no side is officially cheering for a government shutdown. If fringe protestors on either side do, it is their First Amendment right. It is time to recognize, however, that conscious efforts have been made to keep the government open. Conscious efforts have been made to communicate how Obamacare is bad policy. There are options to improve health care for Americans, and the free market can offer it. The question and opportunity lies in whether or not we are willing to place emotional appeals aside, look at economic and financial data and begin crafting solutions that incentivize healthier lifestyles and promote competition among insurance companies.

One of the benefits of the “D” party’s tactics is that it has begun to instill the idea that the budget should become a point by point negotiation. In place of passing a single or small number of bills with funding of hundreds of programs (some of which are unsavory or bloated), the House has started passing single department or single program budget bills. This has the effect of allowing debate on something specific; something that all parties may agree is the correct level of funding. 
A nation (as well an individual) that is in debt, MUST prioritize. Hopefully the governing parties will fund the most critical government functions first and stop funding once the projected tax receipts are gone (instead of continuing to fund for more than a trillion dollars). 
Hopefully this PPACA and Debt Limit Debate will become the path to sustainability and the repayment of the $17+ trillion debt incurred by the federal government as well as the saving to pay the $100+ trillion in liabilities.
Excellent editorial.  Unfortunately, I’m afraid it won’t penetrate the skulls of its intended audience, since the left makes political judgments based on emotion, not logic. As long as the loudest voices (e.g. the media) continue to demonize conservatives, it will always be Democrat vs. Republican: good vs. evil, and the country will continue its turn to the left.
Agree with USA.
The principles taught in Saul Alinsky’s “Rules for Radicals” are being followed by Obama, Reid, their minions and the MSM. It’s interesting that even Nazi Propagandist Joseph Goebbels’ philosophies are being followed, such as:
“Success is the important thing. Propaganda is not a matter for average minds, but rather a matter for practitioners. It is not supposed to be lovely or theoretically correct. I do not care if I give wonderful, aesthetically elegant speeches, or speak so that women cry. The point of a political speech is to persuade people of what we think right. I speak differently in the provinces than I do in Berlin, and when I speak in Bayreuth, I say different things than I say in the Pharus Hall. That is a matter of practice, not of theory. We do not want to be a movement of a few straw brains, but rather a movement that can conquer the broad masses. Propaganda should be popular, not intellectually pleasing. It is not the task of propaganda to discover intellectual truths.” 
I’m so verklempt. Talk amongst yourselves!
…And this comment section scores a 4 on the Godwin’s Law scale!  Well done, everybody.
How easy it is to inappropriately invoke Godwin’s Law in order to distract from the debate without providing any evidence of your own.  Let me break it down for you: USA made a comment about emotional messages, not factual ones, appealing to liberals.  In agreement, thekatman noted that the Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels relied on emotional messages, not factual ones, to appeal to his subjects.  The connection between the two ideas makes the analogy appropriate, whether or not you agree with the original claim. A generally accepted corollary to Godwin’s Law is that falsely invoking it causes you to have lost the debate.  Please try again once you’ve discovered how to present a logical argument.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cautioned the world against a nuclear capable Iran this week in his address to the United Nations, according to Foreign Policy Journal. Netanyahu, like many in the international community, believe that Iran would use a nuclear weapon against Israel because the country views Israel as an illegitimate Jewish state in a predominantly Arab region.
Victoria Cuthbertson | Daily Trojan
 
Nuclear weapons are undoubtedly dangerous. Nobel Laureate Thomas Schelling wrote in his 1966 book, Arms and Influence, “Nuclear weapons make it possible to do monstrous violence to the enemy without first achieving victory […] Victory is no longer a prerequisite for hurting the enemy […] One need not wait until he has won the war before inflicting ‘unendurable’ damages on his enemy.”
The late Kenneth Waltz wrote extensively on the subject of Iran, the bomb and structural stability. In an article for the Foreign Affairs Journal titled “Why Iran Should Get the Bomb,” Waltz argued that the Islamic republic wants to get the nuclear weapons not for nefarious attacks on neighbors of different faiths, but to ensure its own survival in the increasingly militarized and westernized Middle East. As John Mearsheimer writes in his book The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, a nuclear bomb is a deterrent, a last resort weapon that ensures that one country will not attempt to wipe out the other for fear of nuclear reprisal. In effect, the bomb acts as insurance against a Western attack. And with the history of American involvement in the region over the past decade, Iran’s fear of Western invasion is legitimate.
Iran needs their weapons at this point because they have been isolated from the international community and cannot ensure a place for itself in the Middle East through other means. The West has imposed sanctions on Iran, but not to the point where Iran would give up its nuclear ambition.
According to the Brookings Institution, the sanctions hurt Iran and disconnect Iranian oil from parts of the world, but they cannot do enough damage to stop Iran from developing a bomb. In Foreign Affairs, Waltz writes,“If Tehran determines that its security depends on possessing nuclear weapons, sanctions are unlikely to change its mind. In fact, adding still more sanctions now could make Iran feel even more vulnerable, giving it still more reason to seek the protection of the ultimate deterrent.” Indeed, the sanctions have prevented Iran from developing serious economic ties to the rest of the world. Leslie Gelb, the President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations wrote in his 2010 article “GDP Now Matters More Than Force,” that connections to the global marketplace matter more to countries than the ability to defend themselves. Iran has the ability to become a significant oil exporter, given that it has the fourth largest reserves of crude oil in the world, according to the CIA World Factbook. There would be little reason for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon if it had the ability to sell its oil on a world stage, bring foreign entrepreneurs into the country and become economically connected to the Middle East and the world. Financially, it would make no sense for the West to attack Iran if the country made up a significant portion of regional or world trade. Since this path is not open to Iran under current sanctions, Iran must fall back on trying to create a nuclear weapon.
Instead of looking to squash Iranian nuclear ambitions through an economic deterrent, the world should transition the focus from nuclear security to economic security. By lifting sanctions and giving the Iranian people the ability to buy and sell products on the world market, the resulting wealth through integration into world markets would give Iran an economic disincentive to jeopardize its ties to the world. If the Iranian people see their country become more open and integrated into the world, than the emphasis in Iran might shift from nuclear proliferation to economic prosperity because the benefits of growth and economic security outweigh nuclear security.
Israel has the right to be scared of a nuclear Iran, just as Iran has the right to be afraid of Western attack. Alleviating both of these fears, however, will require a new approach that transitions Iran from reliance on physical security to economic interdependence.

Iran has consciously used sanctions to bludgeon its own people to make points with the global press. While its people can’t access capital, Iran offers a $3.6 billion credit line to Syria. While its people can’t find employment, Iran builds and operates 5,000 new centrifuges to enrich uranium and while hyperinflation wracks the economy, Iran dabbles in credit swaps to bolster its support for Hezbollah and now Hamas. Rouhani, a career hardliner, speaks of moderation, but ultimately Iran must demonstrate its commitment to advancing peace not by making demands on the world like it did under Ahmadinejad, but take steps to release political prisoners, halt public executions, restore open Internet access to social media, restore shuttered opposition media, prohibit the moral police from abusing women and step back from its support of foreign ventures in Syria. Economic sanctions can be quickly lifted if Iran’s leaders, especially Khamenei, took some of these steps, but I am not hopeful of such a change in direction, which is why these new sanctions are important to keep the pressure on. If you want to see what I mean, check out Rouhani’s career highlights at http://www.hassan-rouhani.info.
You should also note in your future writings that Iran is not suicidal.  A country that has managed to survive inflicted war, coup attempt (1980 Nojeh coup), sanctions,terrorism, etc., is not about to develop a bomb and attack Israel with over 200 nuclear weapons and America’s nuclear arsenal to boost.  Also remember that the well-being of Palestinians is the corner stone of their policy . How likely is it that they would kill them with a bomb??  Your point about economic prosperity is spot on.  Try to disassociate your thinking and logic from the mainstream lies –  I think you are capable.
Kudos, Dan. I hope you always keep up with this spirit.  It is doubtful that Iran wants nuclear weapons.   They don’t need it . During the 1980-88 war, they were fighting not just Iraq, but almost the entire world . Washington and allies not only helped Saddam with satellite targeting, but gave weapons including chemical weapons.  The war happened when the Shah’s military was virtually dissolved, with high ranking officials on the run or dead.  yet, the world did not managed to defeat Iran.     Now, they are far better situated, stronger, with almost triple the population mostly of military age.  They don’t need a bomb.   Only the cowardly adversaries of Iran do.
“During the 1980-88 war, they were fighting not just Iraq, but almost the entire world .”
Soryaya, your propensity for hyperbole is only matched by your affinity of misinformation.
“Instead of looking to squash Iranian nuclear ambitions through an economic deterrent, the world should transition the focus from nuclear security to economic security.”
Another grand rationalization with no basis in reality.
The truth is that Islam is a deterrent to economic security, economic stability and economic prosperity.  
Even countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait – all countries drowning in oil – lag behind the only non-Muslim country in the region (Israel) thanks to Islam’s retrograde influence.
“Iran needs their weapons at this point because they have been isolated from the international community and cannot ensure a place for itself in the Middle East through other means.”
Talk about a grand rationalization.  Simply remarkable.
Iran is isolated not because of what others do to it, but because of it.  It, Iran, is not interested in normal relations with others, Dan.  Iran is a theocratic dictatorship that is interested in rebuilding a Shiite caliphate, Dan.  Read their mouths when their imams speak, Dan, and they will tell you this loudly and clearly.
Not everything is America’s fault, Dan.  Muslims are not killing off Buddhists in Southern Thailand, Hindus in Pakistan, Animists in Sudan because of American policies but because Islam’s core tenets include the goal of ruling the world.  If you don’t believe me then read the Quran instead.
Dan Morgan-Russell writes a nicely-reasoned article and cites famous international affairs expert Kenneth Waltz, whose writings I studied years ago while getting my BA and MA in international relations at USC. Their chain of logic makes sense, if one condition exists:  That Iran is, and will be governed by a national authority that is rational and most concerned with Iranian national interests. 
But if that government is a theocracy with fanatical messianic views, they may not follow a path that is very rational. For example, they might argue that a nuclear strike against Israel would destroy it and that God would protect Iran against any Israeli counterstrike. Perhaps such a leadership would believe that the religious merit of destroying Israel was so holy, so sacred, so blessed by God, that His protection would insure that Iran only prospers and would not suffer at all any military consequences. 
Sound crazy to you? Would you bet that leaders like the current Supreme Leader of Iran, Grand Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei, would not believe this and order a strike? Or that another President like Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would not initiate hostilities with Israel leading to an Iranian nuclear strike?
