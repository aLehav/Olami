In addition to the weekend’s seemingly endless lineup of literature, speakers and vendors, multiple Trojans are set to hit the USC Stage for a slew of musical performances throughout the weekend. Here are a few of the current and former students performing at the festival.

SATURDAY 
SPIRIT OF TROY 
10 a.m.
On Saturday, the USC Trojan Marching Band, also known as The Spirit of Troy, will kick off the festival. There are more than 300 students involved in the Marching Band, making it USC’s largest spirit organization and a community staple at sporting events. 

KAUFMAN DANCE
11:40 a.m.
The Marching Band’s kickoff will be followed by a showcase of students from the Kaufman School of Dance. Kaufman is known for its innovation and versatility, offering instruction in a variety of dance styles. The student dancers will perform dynamic, self-choreographed pieces.

THE TROJAN MEN
12:50 p.m.
Taking the stage after the dancers will be The Trojan Men, USC’s only all-male a cappella group. Established in 2005, this musical group brings its upbeat Trojan spirit to every performance.

ASHLEY CHANEL
2:00 p.m.
The last USC alumnus on Saturday’s slate is R&B artist Ashley Chanel. A class of 2016 graduate, Chanel received a dual degree in music industry and jazz studies from the Thornton School of Music. An experienced performer, Chanel will get the chance to perform solo and showcase pieces from her debut album, “#Rightnow” this weekend. 

MADDIE ROSS
5:30 p.m.
Among Saturday’s lineup is indie rocker Maddie Ross, a Los Angeles native and class of 2014 graduate whose music focuses on themes of love and queerness. Ross was named “The Best DIY Rock Star You’ve Never Heard Of” by Billboard in 2017 and has been a rising star in L.A.’s music scene since releasing songs like “Loners” and “Tell Your Friends.” 

SUNDAY
THE TRAILBLAZERS
11:40 a.m.
After the Trojan Marching Band starts Sunday’s performances, several Thornton students will share the stage with the Urban Voices Project. This project offers musical education and performance opportunities to locals who have dealt with homelessness, unemployment or mental health issues. In 2018, it collaborated with Thornton students to form The Trailblazers, a group that will perform several original choir arrangements during its set. 

JENSEN McRAE
12:50 p.m.
Jensen McRae, a senior majoring in popular music performance, will perform Sunday afternoon. A first-time performer at the festival, the singer-songwriter will play entirely original songs during her set. She described her music style as a folk-pop-soul hybrid, and she said she’s often compared to Tracy Chapman. She draws her personal inspiration from artists like Sara Bareilles, Bon Iver and John Mayer but also pulls from R&B and soul music. Although she is new to the USC stage, she is a long time patron of the Festival of Books. 

SoCal VoCals 
4:20 p.m.
The Festival will be closed out by the SoCal VoCals, USC’s premier co-ed a cappella group. Established in 1995, the VoCals comprise 19 talented vocalists and boast four International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella titles. In addition to releasing eight studio albums, the group has performed at some of the largest music halls and auditoriums in the nation. Their energy, experience and charisma will finish out the festival with a bang.

While the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books might be best known for its ability to draw in world-renowned writers, artists and musicians, its curated selection of food vendors can provide the perfect gastronomic complement to literary talent. With 17 different food trucks that will be parked on USC’s campus, here’s just a few from which to grab a bite.

Belly Bombz
Once a small food tent in a Long Beach-based farmers’ market, Belly Bombz serves patrons Korean wings, bowls and fries. This gourmet cuisine caters to a broad audience with its ability to satisfy both hardcore wing enthusiasts and newcomers brimming with intrigue. The wings are the main focal point, as Belly Bombz offers boneless and bone-in options for meat lovers. Crispy tofu is an alternative for vegetarians. Spice levels showcase the complete spectrum, starting with sweet wings like soy caramel to hot wings like sriracha lime. The truck also combines a few ingredients to create unique wing flavors. Bomb dust mixes together a spicy Memphis BBQ dry rub with a sweet flavor, while zombie blends a roasted red bell habanero with buffalo sauce. The bowl portion features three meat options to pair with rice and greens — spicy Korean BBQ pork, soy garlic chicken and short ribs. On the side, customers can choose among garlic, bomb dust and spicy barbecue pork-loaded fries.

L.A. Cousins Maine Lobster 
Since its humble beginnings in 2012 with a single food truck in L.A. Cousins Maine Lobster is a world-renowned business that rose to fame after being featured on the ABC television show “Shark Tank.” Expanding into 20 different trucks scattered across 13 cities in the United States, co-founders and cousins Jimmy and Sabin offer customers a wide variety of delectable seafood options. The menu is split into three main categories: rolls, bisque/chowder and specialties. The lobster rolls are their signature item, with two styles relating back to the founders’ roots — Maine, chilled with a touch of mayo, and Connecticut, served warm with butter and lemon. Similarly, the soups are available in two options — New England clam chowder and lobster bisque (both $6 per cup and $7 for a bowl). In the specialties section, one can find a wide range of items — ranging from lobster grilled cheese, shrimp tacos and lobster quesadilla. And rounding out the list, one can supplement their main entree with a side of tater tots or a whoopie pie for dessert. 

Hungry Nomad
Bringing Armenian flair to the festival, Hungry Nomad is one of the only trucks that will serve Mediterranean cuisine. The establishment serves homemade dishes the family has made for generations, evolving to incorporate Californian elements in the recipes. Sandwiches, wraps and salads encompass the majority of the menu. The chicken pesto and blue cheese steak sandwich are just a couple of the choices featured, with the blue cheese option “guaranteed to put a smile on your face” by the owners. Vegetarian options fill up nearly half of the menu, including items such as the avocado stack sandwich, the za’atar feta wrap and the fattoush salad — Hungry Nomad’s best selling item. On the side, baked za’atar chips are seasoned with a mixture of several Mediterranean herbs and hummus comes in heaping quantities, perfect to use as a dip for pita bread.

Palazzolo’s Gelato
Boasting 100% raw, all-natural ingredients and 20 flavors, Palazzolo’s Gelato provides customers with one-of-a-kind creations. The company was formed to create “the finest gelato and sorbetto this world has ever tasted,” free of artificial ingredients such as fillers, pastes or powders. Its current menu offers a wide assortment of flavors, ultimately satisfying any palette. Looking for something rich and creamy? Triple dark chocolate, bourbon caramel pecan or cappuccino chocolate swirl can handle that. Something fruity? Fresh strawberry, mango sorbet or banana caramel praline can satisfy that spot. A more lighthearted flavor? Chocolate chip cookie dough and peanut butter cup can immerse one into delectable nostalgia. And there are various unique combinations to try, with toasted coconut almond fudge and Mexican chocolate chipotle appealing to the adventurous.

Rice Balls of Fire
Having by far the most experience of the five food trucks, with past establishments in the Bay Area, Guam and South Korea, Chef James Parker’s Rice Balls of Fire offers Asian fusion cuisine. Mixing together a plethora of cultures — Korean, Japanese, Hawaiian, Mexican and American — the extensive menu presents more than 30 items. Entrees come in various forms and sizes. Sushi burritos are packed with typical sushi ingredients, from sashimi tuna and salmon to various vegetables. Tater tot dishes fuse Asian cultures into the fried potatoes, creating concoctions such as bulgogi, kimchi and pork belly tots. Grilled cheese follows the same route, combining similar ingredients to make items such as bulgogi and pork belly grilled cheese. In a separate section, the menu unleashes a handful of particularly unique oddities, such as SPAM musubi, Korean BBQ burrito and spice popcorn KFC. Topping off the menu, fresh watermelon, slush boba and milk tea boba drinks can help quench anyone’s thirst.

This weekend, USC students and fellow Angelenos will be immersed into a world of storytelling, innovation and intellectual discussion at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, the largest book festival in the country. Taking place across University Park Campus on April 13 and 14, the event will host over 500 authors, artists, musicians, chefs, filmmakers and other guests. 
But putting together such a large-scale production is no easy task. 
Los Angeles Times event director Scott Dallavo described the year-round fundraising and six-month programming and coordination cycle to the Daily Trojan as a “giant Jenga puzzle.”
Part of this puzzle is securing high-profile guests for the event. While names like Karamo Brown and Roxane Gay will surely garner much attention, Dallavo says this year’s Festival of Books will elevate the larger Los Angeles community and the future of storytelling as we know it.
Unlike many other interactive media festivals, such as South by Southwest, the Festival of Books is free to the public. Free admission is not the only aspect that makes the festival so accessible to the community — Dallavo cites USC’s central location in L.A. and the proximity of the Expo Metro Line as equally important factors.
The festival’s accessibility also goes beyond location logistics.
While books are readily available through public libraries, bookstores and book exchanges, the general public often gets left behind when new forms of storytelling emerge because they simply lack the awareness and resources to engage with them. Dallavo challenges the notion that storytelling must be confined to the traditional book medium.
“Stories are the currency … books are the vehicle,” Dallavo said. “But the currency of why people are coming can take a lot of different forms, and that’s the way the festival has grown, especially while at USC.”
 Newstory, a more recent addition to the event, encapsulates how the Festival of Books has evolved beyond the page. Newstory offers alternative forms of storytelling and expression such as virtual reality, film, live music and podcasts.
 “As events like the Festival of Books make these forms of storytelling more universally acceptable, then it can broaden the number of people who are telling stories across these mediums, and therefore they’ll be more interesting,” said Clint Schaff, the Times’ vice president of strategy and development and producer of Newstory. “It’s a circle where storytellers in the community who are normal people aren’t going to be creating stories in these mediums until they’re familiar with them and the power of them.”
Many installments within the festival and Newstory involve live performances and various activities that involve audience participation in story construction. Such immersive experiences are meant to encourage individuals to get off their phones and have a shared experience with their fellow community members.
“People are looking for authenticity in a world of tech-enabled conversation,” Schaff said.
Dallavo and Schaff suggest that innovative uses of technology in storytelling do not serve to move us past the days of traditional narrative found in books. Rather, they serve to enhance expression, paving a way for new types of stories that are unable to be told fully through “antiquated” forms of media.
Now more than ever, Dallavo said, the Festival of Books is determined to offer a wide range of well-known stories as well as emerging ones. The festival will feature different authors, speakers, publishers and innovative exhibits like Newstory, which Dallavo joked will monopolize all of his time at the festival.

As a fashion lover, I believe that one of the best parts about shopping is wearing a new piece for the first time and finding the pairings to make the perfect outfit. And when you get the outfit for a great price, the feeling is even better. However, fast fashion’s “great” prices have detrimental, lasting effects on the environment, and these practices can often deter shoppers from spending on fast fashion brands. 
The rising trend of conscious consumerism means it’s more common than ever for young people to shop with environmentally conscious vendors. 
Part of this growing excitement can be attributed to the increasingly trendy styles and pieces produced by environmentally conscious retail companies. Although this movement has been growing, many shoppers are faced with the fact that shopping at these retailers can often be more expensive. 
Despite some higher prices, eco-friendly brands have employed some compelling strategies driving consumers toward making more environmentally conscious fashion choices. Some brands use an integrated social and digital media strategy to sell clothes, rather than establishing a full brick-and-mortar store. As many of these brands are relatively new, they have an edge on more established brands in terms of the social media space. 
Environmentally conscious brands like Reformation and Everlane create an immersive experience that allows their consumers to see how their purchases directly impact the environment.
Founded in 2009, Reformation tailors a unique social media and marketing presence. The brand often posts photos of their customers wearing their pieces and pairs them with the amount of carbon, water and other materials that were conserved in the making of this product. Reformation has sold carbon credits to customers, which has helped raise awareness of the fashion industry’s environmental impact and educate consumers on more conscious purchasing choices.
Reformation also uses a digital strategy for its brick-and-mortar stores. Its shops aren’t flooded with bulging racks, they’re simple and clean. It even lets the customer select what they want to try on through a screen, and they’re selection waits for them in the dressing room. For me, this shopping experience is much more preferable to sifting through racks to find the perfect style or size.  
Glaring evidence of the fashion industry’s impact on the environment has been upsetting to many consumers but, at the end of the day, consumers have the final say as to what brands they choose to support with their dollars. The rise of environmentally conscious brands is one way that consumers have shown their demands. Hopefully this will push all brands toward greener environmental practices.

Despite its focus on all things literary, this weekend’s Festival of Books features unique programming beyond exploring writers’ panels and talks. The largest book festival in the country will also host a variety of innovative exhibitors seeking to share their crafts and inspire others. With the plethora of displays and booths around campus, one would be hard-pressed to try to visit them all. So, here are are a few notable vendors to look out for over the course of the weekend.

1. Vroman’s Bookstore
As Southern California’s oldest and largest independently owned bookstore, Vroman’s Bookstore has cemented itself in local history as a literary hallmark. Its extensive inventory and knowledgeable staff have helped the family-owned establishment thrive since 1894. Whether you’re looking for quirky, fun cards and gifts to give to your friends or bestselling novels to stock your shelf, make sure to check out one of Vroman’s two tables at the festival. Vroman’s main booth will hold signed copies and current best sellers, while its children’s booth will serve books for younger audiences.

2. Beauty Is by Kristy Eddy
In a media-saturated world, harmful beauty standards have a way of impacting even the youngest of children. Realizing this, former Mrs. California 2017 Kristy Eddy was outraged by the youth’s exposure to negative messages, so she decided to write her own children’s book focused on teaching young girls the powerful lesson that beauty is, in fact, undefined. “Beauty Is” is a creative vessel for teaching that everyone should explore, whether or not they have a young child in their family. The “Beauty Is” booth will sell its latest releases, including the inclusive coloring book “Color Me Beautiful” — all customers will receive signed copies of each book purchase. 

3. Farm Fresh To You
If purchasing delicious fresh produce, supporting local businesses and learning about sustainable agriculture sound appealing to you, the Farm Fresh To You booth is a must-visit. Founded by Kathleen Barsotti and Martin Barnes in 1976, this local farm supplies the greater Los Angeles area with organic, seasonal fruits and vegetables through a convenient home delivery service. The Farm Fresh To You table will have all the resources you need to maintain a healthy, organic lifestyle. From answering food-related questions to helping patrons sign up for the service, the booth will allow students to learn about the importance of sustainable, organic eating. 

4. It Gets Better Project
Uplifting and empowering the LGBTQ+ community since 2010, the It Gets Better Project began as an encouragement campaign on social media. However, it has evolved into a major multimedia nonprofit that has created a supportive network for the LGBTQ+ community around the world. At the Festival of Books, the organization will feature some of today’s top LGBTQ+ books, such as “It Gets Better,” “Boy Robot” and “What If It’s Us” for a small donation — all of which will go to support It Gets Better EDU, one of the group’s newest youth education programs. Maxwell Poth, the founder of LGBTQ+ nonprofit and storytelling venture “Project Contrast: Series 3,” will also be in at the beach. 

5. The Far Sight
In recent years, the use of virtual and augmented reality softwares has been on the rise, and The Far Sight company has made the most of this tech explosion by combining traditional print books with cutting edge technology. With the The Far Sight app, readers can immerse themselves in “Tide Pools,” an augmented reality project that brings the pages of a book to life by turning still images into videos. The Far Sight booth will provide plenty of information on the AR software and possibly even feature some interactives for visitors to sample. Tech enthusiasts and book lovers alike should stop by this display to get a first look at what could be the future of storytelling.

6. Writer’s Blok 
For the Festival of Books to take place, talented writers and authors must be heavily involved. Writer’s Blok is a community space dedicated to supporting and encouraging collaboration among writers. From breakout co-working sessions to helpful Q&A sessions, Writer’s Blok ensures its members are never alone throughout their writing processes. Whether you’re a seasoned author or just dying to pick up the pen, this booth is a great place to learn about the organization, and about how to cure writer’s block.

From severe wildfires to rising sea levels, climate change is increasingly impacting the daily lives of people around the world, environmental expert Barbara Finamore told a crowd of about 40 Thursday during an event led by the U.S.-China Institute. 
She said China, which has the world’s second largest economy and the world’s largest emitter of carbon gas, is leading a global clean energy revolution. 
Finamore, the senior strategic director for Asia at the Natural Resources Defense Council, led the panel, which focused on  China’s role in fighting against climate change. The event was held at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
Finamore has spent nearly 40 years working with environmental policies. She is the founder of NRDC’s China Program, the first clean energy program to be launched by an international non-governmental organizations. She is also the co-founder and president of the China-U.S. Energy Innovation Alliance.
Finamore said that at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, developed countries were tasked with the majority of the responsibility in addressing climate change. But since then, China — considered a developing country — has gradually led the worldwide fight against climate change.
She also spoke about China’s contributions to the goals listed in the 2015 Paris Agreement for mitigating the effects of climate change as an example.
“China was widely blamed for the failure of the global community to reach a comprehensive climate treaty,” Finamore said. “Yet only a few years later, China was instrumental, along with the United States, in building the momentum of the Paris Agreement.”
According to Finamore, when China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, its coal-related emissions began to increase dramatically. In 2006, China became the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide. However, China’s coal emissions started to decrease in 2010 when the government realized that industrial exports with high coal emission came at the expense of citizens’ lives, she said.
“It was like living in an airport smoking lounge [when] living in Beijing,” Finamore said. “The public concern soured, and the government realized that something had to be done. So by the end of that year, it had invested $1.7 trillion in air pollution control.”
Finamore said China took advantage of the opportunity to harness renewable energy in the fight against climate change, and in 2013, China became the world’s largest investor in renewable energy.
“A little more than 10 years ago, China was already the leading exporter of solar panels, and today nine out of 10 of the largest solar panel manufacturers in the world are Chinese,” Finamore said. “By next year, China will have the four times the solar energy capacity of the United States.”
Finamore also discussed the importance of China’s role in the electric vehicle market. She said China owns 40% of the world’s electric vehicles and 99% of the world’s electric buses.
“China has [been] doing more than anybody else to move this new technology a lot,” Finamore said. “I never saw the vehicle industry move so fast. Within weeks, every major automaker had announced new investments, new production facilities, new modelized electric vehicles.”
Finamore said China has also tried to develop green finance — the use of financial instruments to incentivize green initiatives — through Belt and Road Initiative, which was proposed in 2013 by President Xi Jinping. The initiative aims to connect finance and transportation among 70 countries, which comprise 60% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions.
“The type of project that China funds is going to play a really important role in determining whether these recipient countries will make their Paris agreements,” Finamore said. “China, in fact, is financing more renewable energy in these countries than anyone else.”
Finamore said the NRDC in Beijing has tried to propose mandatory cuts on coal consumption, along with 20 other Chinese institutions. She emphasized the importance of cooperation in the fight against climate change.
“It’s very clear that every country, every city, every state, every province, every investor, every business, every person needs to jump into the battle, step up their level of ambition and accelerate their effort,” Finamore said.
Chengcheng Mei, a first-year graduate student majoring in public policy, asked how students and NGOs like NRDC can make up for the lack of policy analysts and bring attention to policy making. 
Finamore said that only requiring people to stop burning coal without offering detailed planning is not an effective policy, so NRDC focuses on four provinces in China to help them implement the clean energy locally.
Xinruihe Wang, a freshman majoring in communication, said she was shocked to learn all the things China has done to fight climate change.
“As a Chinese [person], I never paid close attention to this kind of issue, and it’s pretty interesting to hear [Finamore saying] that China actually plays a really important role in saving the planet,” Wang said. “I’m really proud of that.”

Universal Filmed Entertainment Chairwoman Donna Langley will deliver the School of Cinematic Arts commencement address during the satellite ceremony May 10, SCA dean Elizabeth Daley announced Thursday. 
“We are overjoyed that Donna Langley, an iconic force in the entertainment industry, will be sharing her invaluable insight with our graduating class this year,” Daley wrote in a press release. 
Langley, who oversees global production, marketing and distribution for Universal Pictures, Universal Pictures International, Universal Pictures Entertainment, Focus Features and DreamWorks Animation, joined SCA’s Board of Councilors in February. 
She joined Universal as senior vice president of production in 2001 and was appointed chairwoman in January. During her 18-year career at Universal, the company has produced movies like  “Green Book,” “BlacKkKlansman” and “Us.” In 2014, Langley was named one of Variety’s 2014 Power of Women honorees for her work with the nonprofit Vital Voices, an organization that seeks to empower women politically and economically.
Langley follows Warner Bros. Entertainment chairman Kevin Tsujihara who spoke at the SCA commencement ceremony in 2018. 
“We are also thrilled to present Nahnatchka Khan, a trailblazing screenwriter, director and producer, with the Mary Pickford Alumni Award,” Daley wrote. “Both are exemplary role models for our students and it is an honor to have them join us at this year’s commencement ceremony.”
The Mary Pickford Alumni Award, which is sponsored by the Mary Pickford Foundation, pays tribute to USC alumni “whose extraordinary achievements bring special distinction to the 
university and to the industry,” the press release read. 
Khan, class of 1994, is the creator and producer of ABC’s “Fresh Off the Boat” and previously served as an executive producer of “Don’t Trust the B—- in Apartment 23” and “American Dad!” Her directorial debut “Always Be My Maybe,” starring Ali Wong and Randall Park, is set for release on Netflix this summer.

When the FBI uncovered the largest college bribery scheme in American history from its “Operation Varsity Blues” investigation, it seemed like the perfect scam.
Wealthy parents paid William “Rick” Singer, who had connections with athletics faculty at top universities like USC, to create falsified athletic profiles for their children and have them admitted as athletes.
While 33 parents were named in the indictment, Singer had 700-plus clients from 2011 to 2019, court documents read. By the numbers, the scheme went undisturbed until the FBI was tipped off during a separate investigation. But according to the affidavit, there were warning signs at USC and other universities that could have tipped admission officials off before the FBI got involved.
Despite emails from high school counselors and college coaches who questioned the students’ athletic resume or if they were actually on the roster, Singer’s scheme remained intact, and the students matriculated. 
At USC, former senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel, who was terminated the day the investigation was released, presented fake athletic profiles to the admission committee and advocated for the students’ admission, as she would with all student-athletes.
William Tierney, co-director of the Pullias Center for Higher Education, referred to the scheme as a “masterful scam.”
“What [Singer] discovered is the weak link because it wouldn’t have worked … if you were just a regular student applying and went to the admission office this would not have happened,” Tierney said. “So he was a brilliant guy, I mean what a crook.”
“Fuller House” actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, paid $500,000 to have their daughters, Isabella and Olivia Jade, admitted to USC as women’s crew recruits, despite no rowing experience.
According to the FBI documents, their guidance counselor believed the girls’ applications may have contained “misleading information” because she believed neither of them had the experience to have been characterized as athletic recruits. Loughlin later emailed Singer asking for assistance in Olivia Jade’s college applications.
After Olivia Jade received her official acceptance to USC, the high school counselor emailed Giannulli, saying that he had been in contact with a senior assistant director of admissions at USC and Giannulli. He said their daughter was a coxswain on the team. 
Devin Sloane, the founder and CEO of waterTALENT, started working with Singer in 2017 to guarantee his son’s admission to USC as a water polo recruit. Records show Sloane purchased water polo gear on Amazon. He later emailed a graphic designer to modify an image of his son to appear like a water polo player for a false recruiting profile. 
In November 2017, Heinel presented Sloane’s son to the USC subcommittee for athletic admissions and sent a conditional acceptance letter to Sloane’s son. Sloane paid Heinel $50,000 and sent an additional $200,000 to the Key Worldwide Foundation, which allegedly worked to conceal bribes as donations, after his son received an official acceptance late last March. 
Quickly after, his high school counselor emailed him and his father asking what universities he was admitted to. Sloane forwarded the email to Singer, asking what he should say in order to avoid suspicion from the high school, according to FBI documents. 
“They know about USC,” Singer wrote back to Sloane. “One of the counselors questioned [your son] getting in as water polo player this week. My folks at [U]SC called me, so we could restate [your son] playing in Italy as [his high school] does not have a team.”
After hearing about the issues with the high school counselors, Heinel left a voicemail for Singer, expressing her concern that the bribery scheme could be uncovered. She told Singer the students should say they were walk-ons for their respective sports and look forward to trying out for the team.
“So I just don’t want anybody going into … [Sloane’s son’s high school] and [the Giannulli’s daughters’ high school] yelling at counselors,” Heinel said. “That’ll shut everything down.”
According to Tierney, unlike the general admission process, athletic departments often recruit specific athletes even if they do not meet the school’s typical criteria. Tierney said USC should no longer place the responsibility of presenting applicants to the admission committee onto only one faculty member like Heinel. 
“I think this needs to be some type of cross campus committee that oversees this, so that there’s faculty involvement in it, that there’s the admissions office involved in it and the athletic department rather than simply this one person at the top of a pyramid who was able to add names because it’s worth $100,000 to her,” Tierney said.
Julie Posselt, an associate professor of education, said schools like USC should change their own standards for admission to expect similar academic standards from all applicants.
“I think an important part of what happened here is that students who wouldn’t have been admitted because of their academics were allowed to be considered via athletics,” Posselt said. “Some universities are beginning to work toward having a certain threshold of academics for even the athletes to be considered on. I’d like to see USC move in that direction personally.”
On March 16, USC announced it will conduct a case-by-case review of all students connected to the scheme, as well as an internal investigation to reform areas such as the student-athlete admission process. 
Posselt said many colleges have already begun to change admissions processes by eliminating standardized testing requirements. She said she hopes the FBI’s investigation will push universities to reevaluate the factors they consider in the admission process. 
“There’s already a serious degree of introspection going on on the part of colleges and universities about what they’re looking for and why and what the implications are of how they have thought about merit,” she said. “What happened with the admissions scandal only elevates the need to have conversations like that.”

After winning 11 events at the Jim Click Shootout last week, the Trojan track and field team looks to build on its impressive start to the outdoor season on Friday and Saturday at the Triton Invitational in La Jolla, Calif. USC will face competition from across the country, but most of the opposing teams this weekend are from the Big West Conference, Western Athletic Conference and local community colleges.  
Although many of the Trojans’ top performers on the track will not travel to the meet this weekend, USC will be well represented with a loaded contingent of throwers and a group of younger, less experienced runners seeking to make their mark on collegiate track for the first time.
Vying to improve on his fifth-place finish at last year’s Triton Invitational, senior Nathan Bultman will compete in the hammer throw, an event for which he is ranked 10th on USC’s all-time records list.  
Another Trojan thrower headlining this weekend’s competition is redshirt junior captain Matthew Katnik. Coming off a victory at the Trailblazer Challenge earlier this season, Katnik will seek another first-place result and an improvement on his fifth-place standing in the USC record books in shot put this weekend.
Three Trojan women will compete in the hammer throw, led by sophomore Joy McArthur.  McArthur has registered the 10th best throw in school history and will look to pick up her first victory this season after finishing third at last week’s Jim Click Shootout. Freshmen Karlee Freeman and Natasha Stamp also look to leave with a top finish this weekend.
On the track, freshmen John Dempsey and Devin Bright and sophomore David Hulme seek to burst onto the scene in the men’s 800-meter race. Dempsey and fellow freshman Mitch Libby also hope to capitalize on their competition in the 1500-meter race.
Five Trojan women — freshman Brynn Sauer, sophomore Jennifer Daly, junior Kamryn Weber and seniors Rachel Glynn and Amber Gore — will lead USC’s efforts to capture the 800-meter crown.
Senior distance runner Lauren Maurer looks to end on a high note in the women’s 1500-meter race as her collegiate track career comes to a close.
With the No. 1 women’s team and No. 34 men’s team in the country, USC track and field hopes to use a successful weekend at the Triton Invitation to fuel another national championship run.

As the Trojan women’s lacrosse team wraps up their final matches in the regular season, it will be traveling east this weekend for the second time to meet No. 20 Stony Brook on Sunday at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium. 
The Trojans are currently 13-13 all-time in East Coast games and are 0-2 on Stony Brook’s home turf.
The Seawolves have had a successful season this year, with an impressive roster of notable players who help put points on the board. Junior midfielder Ally Kennedy leads SBU with 41 goals,  46 points, 29 ground balls and 60 draw controls. Coming in at a strong second for the Seawolves’ roster is sophomore midfielder Siobhan Rafferty, who has scored 30 goals and has 16 ground balls. SBU’s senior goalie Anna Tesorierohas also shouldn’t be overlooked, with a .456 save percentage and a 7.86 goals-against average.
The Seawolves hold a strong four-game win streak since their narrow 11-10 loss to Florida. The Seawolves are the nation’s fifth-ranked defense because of their 7.36 goals-against average. 
The Trojans are coming in strong, ranked No. 13 after their 16-0 win against Oregon. USC has come far in the rankings this season since the start of the 2019 season, during which they ranked No. 21. 
USC had a season-long nine-game winning streak until it was snapped in a narrow 9-8 loss to No. 23-ranked Colorado. 
The loss against Colorado marked USC’s 11th all-time loss on their home turf, but they redeemed themselves by playing a clean match against Oregon.
“Lacrosse is notably a game of momentum, within individual games and seasons,” junior midfielder Kerrigan Miller said.
The All-American midfielder is one of USC’s leading players this season. Miller’s efforts have allowed her to rack up 16 goals, 32 draw controls, 39 ground balls and a team-high 28 caused turnovers this season alone.  
“In playing such talented teams this weekend, our team will need to derive its confidence from this week of preparation and commitment to our game plan,” Miller said.
Another key player is USC sophomore goalie Riley Hertford, who has put in the work both on and off the field, helping the Trojans in defense this season and making her presence known since the departure of superstar goalie Gussie Johns last year. Hertford leads the league with an 8.47 goals-against average and tops all players with an aggressive 3.4 ground balls per game. 
A key component forthe Trojans this weekend is working in unison and strong communication on the field as they compete against the Seawolves Sunday.
“Our team plays to win, yet no win is achievable without trust in one another on both ends of the ball,” Miller said.

The No. 2 USC women’s water polo will be back home for senior day in the Uytengsu Aquatic Center this weekend to take on No. 10 Arizona State.
The Trojans, who are 21-1 overall and 3-1 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, already defeated Arizona State this season in a decisive 7-1 victory over the Sun Devils back in February at the Barbara Kalbus Invitational Tournament in Irvine.
In preparation for the match, the Trojans are focusing on the big picture for the rest of the season. 
“We’re focusing on getting better every practice, every game,” junior driver Kelsey McIntosh said. “Focusing on perfecting and getting better at the things that we want to bring out and play with in MPSF and NCAA [tournament play] come the end of April and beginning of May. We’re honing in on mistakes that we’ve made in the past few games, learning from our mistakes and just getting better.”
Junior utility Maud Megens leads the Trojans this year with 54 goals on the season. Drivers sophomore Paige Hauschild and freshman Alejandra Anzar put up 30 each. Senior goalie Amanda Longan anchors the Trojan defense with 182 saves in the books. 
After a 8-9 overtime loss to Stanford two weeks ago that snapped USC’s 36-game win streak, it became clear the Trojans are not invincible. 
“I think it helped us refocus on what our goal is for this season,” McIntosh said. “That loss allowed us to learn from our mistakes. Yes, we didn’t have Maud, but we had control of the game and we just let that slip. So we’re refocusing, re-adding Maud back into the picture after her being gone for a week and taking that full route.”
On offense, USC will need to be conscious of senior attacker Maud Koopman, a scoring force with 46 goals on the season. Sophomore goalie Bridget Johnston will hold down the Sun Devil defense in goal, having saved 77 shots on goal this year, averaging 4.7 saves per game. 
The Trojans faced challenges this past month after losing head coach Jovan Vavic amid the national college admissions bribery scheme. However, the team has displayed its resilience, and McIntosh said the recent administrative changes brought the team closer together. 
“Something like this can either destroy what you had or make you stronger,” McIntosh said. “I’m so happy to say that it’s made us so much stronger. There is so much love and joy and happiness when we come to the pool and do what we love, and that’s what’s kept us strong and keeps us moving to what we want to do at the end of this season in May.”
As regular season play wraps up, the Trojans have one more game against crosstown rival UCLA before the MPSF tournament. These upcoming games will serve not only as opportunities for USC to avenge their loss to Stanford, but also as preparation for MPSF and NCAA tournament play.
“We’re trying to do something special, and that’s go back-to-back for the first time in women’s water polo history here at USC,” McIntosh said.
The match tips off at 1 p.m. Saturday at Uytengsu Aquatics Center. The Trojans will honor their graduating seniors driver Courtney Fahey, goalie Amanda Longan and driver Brooke Presten for senior day before the match begins.

In this week’s installment of “What the Hell is Happening to USC Athletics?”: the transfer portal. This week, almost half of USC’s women’s basketball team entered the transfer portal. Six of the 13-person roster are at least considering — if not set on — leaving Galen Center. Granted, there are two graduate transfers in that group of players, but a daunting statistic nonetheless.
I’m not going to pretend I follow collegiate basketball. However, I do know that the women considering jumping ship are some of USC’s best ballers. 
Senior guard Minyon Moore, one of the graduate transfers who announced she will be transferring, led the Trojans in points, free throws, rebounds, assists and steals this past season. Senior forward Ja’Tavia Tapley also plans to transfer. She posted the second most blocks and rebounds during the 2018-19 season. 
But this issue isn’t unique to women’s basketball. Rather, it is evidence of a larger issue that has been perpetuated over the past year. Student-athletes keep transferring out of USC.
You don’t need to look far to see that this is a major problem with USC football. News of players transferring has been dominating the USC football headlines for the past several months. But some might argue that players transfer all the time. However, a significant portion of the players entering the portal aren’t third string; they are the starters and the impact players USC needs. 
Some of the most notable are redshirt junior receivers Velus Jones Jr. and Trevon Sidney. Jones posted a solid 10.4 yards per reception in 2018. He was a fantastic addition to USC’s receiving core last year. Sidney, on the other hand, didn’t have a whole lot of targets but showed great potential. It’s also important to note that Sidney was left off the spring roster. Jones is listed. Under offensive coordinator Graham Harrell’s air-raid offense, both receivers have the potential to be key players for USC next season, if they decide to stay. 
How could anyone forget about one of the most interesting and jaw-dropping transfers of this spring? Incoming receiver Bru McCoy enrolled at USC early. It seemed like he was all in, ready to join receiving leaders senior Michael Pittman Jr. and sophomore Amon-Ra St. Brown to terrorize secondaries. Then, out of nowhere, he entered the transfer portal and became a Texas Longhorn just days later. 
Those two potential transfers are just drops of water in the ocean of players that continue to enter the transfer portal. For most in the portal, their intentions are not clear. Perhaps, they are just keeping their options open this spring. 
For most players, the reasoning behind this wave of potential transfers is not clear. When McCoy decided to transfer, I wrote in a previous column, “Five-star receivers want to go to a university to do a few things: win football games, get better under great coaches and get noticed by professional scouts. Right now, USC offers only one of those three things and it isn’t the first two.”
Some of my past thoughts hold validity. At least USC has an offensive coordinator now, but if I had to assume the reasoning behind this ordeal, players are unhappier with the athletic department than they are concerned with winning. Considering either the coaching staff or the administration, can you blame them? It’s a mess, and there is a whole lot to be upset about right now. 
USC Athletics needs to make some serious changes soon to retain players. For players to leave USC at such a rapid rate from multiple sports is not a good look for recruits of any sport. After all, when the players leave, the recruits stop coming.
