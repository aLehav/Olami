Daniele Watts, a 28-year-old actress known for her role in  Django Unchained and a USC alumna, was set to speak on a race, sexual expression and civil rights law panel at the Gould School of Law on Wednesday. School officials postponed the event after Watts was charged with lewd conduct on Tuesday.
An unidentified USC official told the Los Angeles Times that the event was postponed because far more people RSVP’d than there were seats available. She said that the Gould classroom could only accommodate 40 people. A new date has not yet been set for the panel. She also said that event was not postponed because of the charges recently filed against Watts.
USC invited Watts to speak on the panel months before she was arrested for alleged lewd misconduct.
On Sept. 11, the Los Angeles Police Department responded to a 911 call that reported a couple having sex in a silver Mercedes-Benz in Studio City outside the CBS Studio. Watts and her boyfriend, Brian James Lucas, matched the descriptions, and Watts was handcuffed after refusing to produce her ID. She claimed that she had not been doing anything wrong, and after eventually showing her ID, she was released. LAPD first said that there was no evidence of a criminal act.
According to BBC News, Watts and Lucas insisted in interviews that there was no public obscenity, just public affection.
Watts claims that she was discriminated against because she is black and Lucas, her boyfriend, is white.
According to the L.A. Times, in a follow-up investigation, spokesman Lt. Andrew Neiman said that they had witnesses who would testify that there was indeed evidence of a criminal act. The couple is due in court on Nov. 13 on the charge of misdemeanor lewd conduct. If convicted, both Watts and Lucas could face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.

USC Spectrum hosted Chade-Meng Tan, Google’s Jolly Good Fellow, at Bovard Auditorium as a kickoff event for Mindful USC, a new university-wide initiative that was launched this fall to make mindfulness practices integral to the culture of the Trojan Family.
Jolly good fellow · Chade-Meng Tan speaks to students in Bovard Auditorium on Wednesday night about the importance of happiness. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The event started with Tan presenting the tenets of his New York Times best-selling book, Search Inside Yourself, followed by a Q&A with the audience. The attendees were then invited to a reception that included a book sale and book signing.
Tan joined Google as a software engineer in 2000 and helped build Google’s first mobile search service. He later became a founding member of a team that evaluated search quality.
Tan began his presentation by highlighting what he currently works on at Google.
“My job description is exactly seven words: ‘Enlighten minds, open hearts, create world peace,’” he said. “I mainly work on two things. The first thing is that I’m trying to scale inner peace, inner joy and compassion worldwide. The second effort I’m involved with is called ‘one billion acts of peace.’ We are working with 13 Nobel Peace Prize laureates to try to inspire one billion peace acts worldwide in five years.”
Varun Soni, the dean of Religious Life and co-chair of the Mindful USC initiative, said he hopes that students will be able to develop mindfulness practices of their own to help with the stress of their lives and also to help them think creatively and compassionately.
“I hope it’ll help them think about the big question in their lives, of meaning and purpose,” he said. “There are a lot of challenges being a student in this day and age. Challenges that no generation has ever faced, especially in terms of technology and the job market. It can be overwhelming, and it could feel like we’re drinking from a fire hose, so I believe that mindfulness can be a useful exercise in helping us deal with all the stress and anxiety that we have in our lives and our work.”
Soni described Tan as a man of many abilities.
“He is a great mindfulness leader of the world but he is also a software engineer,” Soni said. “There are people who are writers, actors and athletes who also talk about mindfulness from their own professional perspectives.”
Tan said he moved away from software engineering in 2008 and is now working on thinking of innovative solutions to solve the world’s most impossible problems.
“What I hope to inspire USC students today is something I think you all have already known,” he said. “I hope to reinforce the idea that emotional intelligence, and specifically goodness, is highly trainable.”
Students felt that Tan’s speech was applicable to their lives.
“I love his humor and energy,” said Daniel Luo, a junior majoring in occupational therapy. “It’s really awesome to see someone who’s so passionate about what he is doing and having so much fun while he’s doing it. His presentation was so clear-cut and simple that it provided a lot of real life usefulness for everyone there.”
Tan wrote his book in 14 weeks based on notes he had collected while at Google.
Soni said the book was integral to the foundation for the Mindful USC initiative.
“What Search Inside Yourself does is that it translates this ancient wisdom of happiness and mindfulness into a contemporary context, to a language that’s digestible for everyone. And, it’s no longer an esoteric tradition,” Soni said.
Students also found Tan’s advice on maintaining positive relationships to be helpful.
“I just heard about it online and thought it would be really interesting to come hear the Chief Happiness Officer of Google talk,” said Brandon Metzger, an undecided sophomore. “It has been really interesting and I really enjoyed it. I really liked his whole outlook on fostering relationships with others.”
Soni hoped the event would encourage student interest in the mindfulness initiative.
“[Students] could drop in at the meditating sessions on campus and my hope is that they’ll find it to be a positive and an important resource for them while they’re students here, and perhaps give them something to take with them when they leave,” Soni said.

On Wednesday afternoon, the Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab hosted Tara Roth, president of the Goldhirsh Foundation, to speak at the institution’s monthly Lunch and Learn series.
Human capital · Tara Roth, president of the Goldhirsh Foundation, said her organization aims to turn people’s ideas into reality. – Christine Yoo | Daily Trojan
The Goldhirsh Foundation is an organization that seeks out emerging innovations and ideas in order to help grow and build other organizations. In 2013, it launched its LA2050 Grants Challenge to impact the future of Los Angeles. Roth has been working with the Goldhirsh Foundation for the past eight years.
“We are coming up with ideas on how to invest in the best way possible,” Roth said.
One way in which the foundation aids the organizations it invests in is through helping them with branding and marketing.
“We take people’s ideas and programs, and we try to make an articulate story about what they are doing,” Roth said. “We look at what brand that they are communicating and what the narrative is that they are projecting. Something that may not be the most interesting or the most riveting, we try presenting in a very compelling way.”
In addition to the economic capital and social capital the foundation focuses on, Roth said they also support organizations with human capital, even serving on the advisory board if needed.
Roth said one thing that’s helped her in her position was her previous experience working with the California Charter Schools Association, during which she was at the other end of these transactions.
“Anyone who is ever giving away money should have always learned to ask for money before,” she said.
Roth also spoke about how the direction of the Goldhirsh Foundation has changed under its new initiative called LA2050. LA2050 is a two-year-old grant challenge through which the Foundation gives away 10 grants of $100,000 each year to organizations that work towards developing and improving L.A.
“We want LA2050 to be understood and owned by the Los Angeles community,” Roth said.
Roth said LA2050 came out of a strategic planning process that looked at Los Angeles today and projection for the city’s future. LA2050 is meant to address any setbacks that were projected.
Roth discussed different ways Los Angeles could improve and positives already happening in the city.
“We have one of the lowest high school graduation rates, we are the homeless capital of the United States,” Roth said. “But we do have good things as well, of course. For every one artist moving out we have two moving in, and our water consumption is the lowest it has been in 20 years.”
In its first two years, the LA2050 Grant Challenge has proven to be a success.
Roth said there were 279 submissions, the majority of which were collaborations from different organizations, and over 70,000 votes from the public. Winners were determined based on both votes from the public and votes from a panel of judges.
“In a city where the voting population is only slightly higher than [participation votes for LA 2050], we are proud of the amount of engagement we saw from the community,” Roth said.
The reason for high participation numbers could be that, according to Roth, the Grant Challenge appealed to several characteristics common among Angelenos.
“We found that Angelenos really want to collaborate, they are very entrepreneurial,” Roth said. “There is a hunger for innovation and dreaming big to make the future a better place for ourselves, for our children and for our grandchildren.”
Attendees, who filled the room, found Roth’s insight into philanthropy helpful.
“Roth was very inspirational and got me excited about L.A. and all the programs in place,” said Amber Lu, a member of USC’s Startup GenYrator, a crowdfunding platform for USC entrepreneurs.
Roth’s talk also appealed to students who might be asking for money from the businesswoman in the future.
“I thought she was totally on point and really described what the Foundation is doing well,” said Michael Shackel, a master’s student studying social work. “To hear from a funder what they are looking to do is helpful, and it is helpful from a business perspective.”

At 9:15 a.m. on Wednesday, the People of the State of California v. Javier Bolden resumed at the downtown Los Angeles Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center. The prosecution, represented by Deputy District Attorney Daniel Akemon, started the fifth day of trial by continuing to examine the lead detective in the case, Detective Vincent Carreon. The jury also saw the remainder of a video that was shown on Tuesday depicting Bolden’s interrogation on May 18, 2012.
The video showed two LAPD detectives interrogating Bolden for a couple of hours. They were seen leaving the interrogation room several times. Carreon claimed that during the beginning of the interrogation Bolden was evasive. That did not seem to be the case after the detectives told Bolden that Bryan Barnes, the other suspect in the case, had accused Bolden of being the shooter.
Carreon said in his testimony that Barnes, in fact, had not been interrogated. The detective said he had fabricated the statement in a ruse to elicit more truthful testimony from Bolden.
Bolden’s criminal defense attorney, Andrew Goldman, from the Office of the Alternate Public Defender, objected to several of Carreon’s statements.
After the interrogation, Carreon said, Bolden was taken to the 77th Street Regional Jail where he was put in a cell with a police informant.
Goldman’s cross-examination of Carreon focused on the fabrications conveyed to his client, as well as the lack of DNA evidence on the scene. The informant had portrayed himself to Bolden as a veteran member of the Bloods gang. Goldman also made a point to highlight the fact that no DNA or fingerprint evidence belonging to his client was found on the scene. During re-direct, however, Akemon elicited testimony that demonstrated that no DNA or fingerprint evidence was recovered.
Akemon then called the lead medical examiner in the case. Dr. Vladimir Levicky introduced himself to the jury as a chief medical examiner with over 24 years experience in forensic pathology.
After laying foundation for Levicky’s expert status, Akemon began the inquiry of Ming Qu’s autopsy. Levicky testified that upon examination he concluded that the bullet entered Qu’s body below and behind the left ear and exited through his right cheek. Judge Stephen Marcus allowed Levicky to stand up and demonstrate the trajectory of the projectile with Akemon using a yardstick to show how the bullet entered Qu’s body.
Levicky testified that the bullet perforated through the soft tissue of the neck, large blood vessels, the pharynx and maxillary bones of Qu’s right cheek. He explained that the most damaging part of the wound was caused by the perforation of large arteries, which made it increasingly difficult for Qu to get enough oxygen to his brain. The official cause of death was the single gunshot wound to the head.
Akemon introduced as evidence photographs of Qu’s autopsy displaying his face and left hand. Several secondary wounds on Qu’s neck matched those of injuries on his left hand.
According to Neon Tommy, LAPD Detective Sean Hansen also took the stand to explain how law enforcement was able to effectively detect Bolden’s location around the time of the murders. Det. Hansen said he used analytics from the Cellular Analysis Survey Team, a federal task force which links the location of the defendant’s cell phone when a call is placed from that device.
After a lunch break, Hansen retook the witness stand. According to his testimony, records showed that Barnes and Bolden used their phones near the crime scene at 12:55 a.m.

The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics continued its Students Talk Back series with a panel entitled “Good Jobs at Good Wages: Putting Los Angeles Back to Work” on Wednesday in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Looking forward · Los Angeles City Councilman Mitchell Englander (R) District 12, expressed concerns about L.A.’s public school system and vocational training. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The panel consisted of students Elena Kuhn of the College Democrats and Sarah Dhanaphatana of the College Republicans as well as L.A. City Councilmember Mitchell Englander of District 12 and South Park Business Improvement District Executive Director Jessica Lall. The discussion was co-moderated by Kerstyn Olson, director of the Unruh Institute, and Anshu Siripurapu, news editor of the Daily Trojan.
The panel opened with a discussion of the complex intergenerational issues associated with urban poverty. Several panelists mentioned the effect of educational opportunities on income disparity.
“We really are a divided city of haves and have nots, and it’s becoming more evident every day,” Englander said. “It’s about opportunities, and it’s about education. We have one of the worst school systems on earth [in Los Angeles] … Our children are dropping out at incredible rates, we’ve cut vocational training … those [programs] are gone, they’ve been decimated.”
Lall agreed, and went on to discuss poverty and education in Los Angeles in a larger context.
“Los Angeles ranks the highest in poverty of the seven largest metropolitan areas in the United States … 28 percent of Angelenos live below the poverty line, and if you don’t get a strong, solid education, your social mobility is limited drastically,” Lall said.
Englander mentioned that existing education issues had been compounded by the closure of vocational schools.
“LAUSD is seeing fewer than 2/3 of all K-12 students graduating high school, graduating with a diploma. Less than half of high school graduates from LAUSD are proficient in English.,” Dhanaphatana, who is also a staff writer for the Daily Trojan, said. “Students simply lack the skills to go beyond entry level jobs.”
Though these students would seek vocational training or attend trade schools, fewer students now receive vocational training.
The panel then moved from discussing systemic issues to discussing possible solutions. Lall suggested that a collaboration between automotive companies and trade schools could ensure that students were learning skills they would need on the job.
“Schools have to look at the skills that are needed by employers and then be nimble with their curriculum,” Lall said.
Englander agreed with the necessity of flexible curricula but said he believes that this is a micro solution to a macro problem. His plan was more ambitious.
“It starts with three words: Break up LAUSD. It’s too big and will never change if we don’t break it up,” Englander said.
While panelists agreed on the complexity and importance of questions of economic disparity, they were also quick to defend their respective party’s ideological stances on the issues when prompted.
“Democrats and Republicans have very distinct views on income inequality,” Dhanaphatana said. “Democrats believe that liberty is immoral unless it brings equality … but I think Republicans realize that inequality will always exist.”
Kuhn disagreed.
“The way I see it is an issue of equity versus efficiency,” Kuhn said. “The equity is that we need to pay workers a living wage based on the work that they’re doing in order to be contributive members of society, whereas Republicans are more concerned with efficiency which would be capitalist profit.”
Everyone was quick to agree, however, that these ideological differences are hard to work around and have created an inefficient legislature.
“I think [the gridlock is] criminal in this country … there are no bipartisan relationships in D.C.,” Englander said, as other panelists nodded in agreement.
Raising the minimum wage was another unanimously agreed upon tactic for combatting poverty and putting Angelenos back to work. Englander and Lall, however, raised some doubts on how this may work in Los Angeles.
“I believe that we should increase the minimum wage, but I’m not sure we should do it as a city,” said Englander, who was worried that raising the minimum wage may drive business out of Los Angeles, which he described as already being a “business unfriendly city.”
Lall echoed his sentiments.
“Should there be a living wage? Yes. But should there also be a business-tax cut to keep businesses here in L.A.? Yes. You need both for a prosperous city,” she said. “When you talk about the minimum wage in a vacuum it’s really dangerous … If you don’t have other reforms you’re just moving the problem to another part of the board.”
UPDATE (10/23 11:50 a.m. ): This article has been updated to amend an error wherein Sarah Dhanaphatana was misquoted as saying fewer than 2/3 of Angelenos graduate as proficient in English. The correct quote is as it appears in the article currently.

Logic is an impressive lyricist and former independent artist who has been in the hip-hop spotlight for years, but he is just now releasing his first album, Under Pressure. This is Logic’s first major release following his signing with Def Jam Records, and the tracklist is stacked with lyrical and musical prowess representative of his years as an independent artist.
With four mixtapes (five including work released under his previous name, Psychological) under his belt, the Maryland native has had plenty of time to find his style, which falls somewhere between Drake and Kendrick Lamar with the lyrical creativity of Kanye West. He lists these artists as influential to his style, but his biggest influence, according to an interview with music blog Fresh New Tracks, is the swinger Frank Sinatra. The jazzy piano riffs that accompany many tracks on Under Pressure are direct lines to Sinatra himself, but with a hip-hop spin that gives Logic a style all his own.
The album starts with Logic playing the piano chords for Kanye West’s “Bound 2” and then drives into a verse about being remembered as Kanye’s iconic riff transitions into beautifully orchestrated pianos and synths that sound more like a swinger’s anthem than a rap track.
“I just want to make these music lovers remember again / while these haters fall back like September again.”
The opening lines of the album give a sneak peak of the rest of the album, which is truly just Logic trying to entertain. Every song is well-crafted and honest, and though they are not all going to be hits, there are enough solid tracks on this album to elevate Logic into mainstream recognition. Within his album, Logic raps about everything from his sister’s crack business to his family to his recent record deal, all with a humble but confident flow that elevates Logic as an emerging master of hip-hop.
Notable tracks include the brooding, hometown hero track “Gang Related” and the powerful outro “Till The End,” which provide insights into the life of Logic, both before and after gaining recognition. “Gang Related” is punctuated with lines about rapping for his home, which is represented in his music via lyrics about gang violence and addiction.
“I knew it, already been through it / I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life / Anybody that’s gang related.”
It is only fitting that Logic, like many recent rappers, has sworn off drugs and alcohol in pursuit of a better life. Growing up, Logic told MTV, both of his parents were addicted to crack cocaine, which often subjected him to neglect and abuse he has since expressed in his songs. In “Under Pressure,” the album’s title song, Logic notes that his sister used to cook crack in her kitchen and that his dad was upset about the mention of his drug use in his son’s music. He notes that he feels like he has neglected his family because of his career and that he wants to connect with them, even though he’s missed birthdays and other important family events.
“Yeah, dear family, I’m so sorry that I’ve been distant / Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent.”
He also raps often about his struggle to stay away from “Nikki,” a female personification of nicotine, which Logic is addicted to. Many verses throughout Under Pressure contain a phrase or two about missing “Nikki,” until the third to last track titled “Nikki” which provides insight into who she really is.
“I can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins / Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain / I tried some others but man they just not as good as you / Going crazy cause I only feel this good with you.”
Logic teased the idea of Nikki on social media for a while before the album’s release, hashtagging #WhoIsNikki and posting frequently to generate buzz for the final reveal. With a strong Internet fan base and a grassroots following fueled mainly by word of mouth, Logic is an artist of the age. His independence from major labels has been inspiring, and even now that he is signed with Def Jam, he has complete creative control over his album and is operating under Visionary Music Group, a small independent label that helped him put out half of his mixtapes.
Even without his independent status, Def Jam provided Logic an amazing opportunity in the form of executive producer No I.D. The infamous producer, credited with mentoring Kanye West and producing Jay-Z’s “D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)” among countless other hits, oversaw the entire process of creating Logic’s new album. The beats still maintain their integrity as clearly Logic’s songs, but now with No I.D. overseeing his work, the artist has a clean, well-produced sound.
Under Pressure is incredible overall, and is streaming completely free on SoundCloud for your listening pleasure. If you have never heard of Logic, now is the time to start listening, because he is already one of the best rappers in hip-hop, and he’s only getting better.

Nature documentaries on film take on a new life due to the much higher quality of the image available with film budgets. Your run-of-the-mill Discovery Channel feature about the Serengeti pales in comparison to films like March of the Penguins or Chimpanzee, where the quality of the image brings the nature to life in a way that the limits of the small screen simply cannot. Yakona, the new documentary about the San Marcos River in Texas, continues that tradition. It is visually stunning. Following the river from prehistoric times until now, the film tries to recreate the river’s-eye view of its interactions with humans. Yet despite the striking visuals, the film fails to really show why we need it.

The film has no narration, and the only dialogue appears when there are people near the river speaking. This gives the film a very atmospheric feel, but it also makes for difficult watching. The series of shots float by lazily while the viewer fights to piece them all together without any sort of help from directors Paul Collins and Anlo Sepulveda.
The first section of the movie feels like an extended cut of one of Terrence Malick’s many nature image interludes in The Tree of Life. There is an extended shot of organisms multiplying underwater, followed by a shot of the sun. We then see prehistoric people fishing in the river, but there isn’t much action here. The film is set up in a sort of vague chronological order in that it begins with simple organisms and prehistoric humans and ends with the state of the river today. As if the murkiness that arises from the lack of narration wasn’t enough, however, Yakona also sometimes jumps around in time while making its way from loincloths to loudspeakers.
While flowing along the river’s history, the film touches on many familiar notes. It shows the struggle between white settlers and Native Americans. We are shown a white man crossing the river toward some natives holding a wooden cross. Later, in one of the most returned-to scenes in the film, a battle between what appeared to be some trigger-happy, manifest destiny-driven surveyors and a group of Comanche warriors plays out on the banks of the river. The obligatory shot of blood turning the river red is included. The side taken by the film is not surprising considering the name of the film: Yakona is the Coahuiltecan word for “rising water.” The decimation of the Native Americans by European settlers is a dark stain on American history; there is no denying that. Nevertheless, it has also not been ignored. It has been well-covered, with much more nuance and thoughtfulness, than Yakona’s brief showing of it does.
Another overplayed theme is the effects that humans have had on the river. There is an extended look at a now-closed water park that used to operate in a different part of the river. Grainy footage of the park back when it was open is juxtaposed with images of the park now overrun with vines and partially underwater. Later on, submerged pieces of water park are removed with cranes while a generic politician makes a speech about conserving and renovating the river. The environmental message isn’t hammered away with quite the same feverishly explicit imagery as blood floating in water, but it is there and, again, its handling is disappointing. Nothing new is said or shown. Most people who will take the time to watch a one-and-a-half-hour film about the history of a river know that the presence of humans near a river, or other natural formation, will have some adverse environmental effects one way or another.
The film isn’t entirely populated by dreamy, slow-motion images of the river and its wildlife or images evoking legitimate, but well-worn, social criticisms. There are also some lovely images of fireworks over a riverside carnival and others of people frolicking in a calm part of the river. The intention seems to be to depict the river in its highs and lows, showing the terrible things that have happened near the river alongside the joy it has brought many. It is an interesting approach — and the most objective one — but it doesn’t make for an especially interesting film. The striking images have their appeal, and some are pretty memorable. An extended shot of a snapping turtle holding onto the foot of an unfortunate bird while the bird tries to shake free to return to air and life was a high point. The rest of the film, however, has few others. As the slow scenes are methodically dropped one by one in front of the viewer without much explanation or order it is hard to maintain focus. Perhaps one needs more than just a random river’s point of view to make a compelling film. Or, perhaps it is this film’s overreliance on a series of impressionistic images instead of any actual direction that sinks it under its own slowly moving waters.

Kat Edmonson’s voice sounds like it belongs on a record player or gramophone; it’s vintage in the modern era. Full of delicacy and a slight rasp, the American singer-songwriter’s voice radiates charm and evokes a lost sound from seven decades past, more than four decades before she was even born.
Old soul · Edmonson grew up singing along to ’40s and ’50s greats like Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra. She credits this exposure to a different style of singing for her own unique approach. – Photo courtesy of Sacks & Company
Edmonson released her latest record, The Big Picture, in September, and with it adds a litany of songs that all aim to emulate and elicit the sonic and lyrical style of the artists who shaped her early years.
The sweet songstress, 31, who now has three completed albums in her discography, began singing along to her television when she was four years old. Edmonson favored old movies featuring the famed singers of the 1940s and 1950s such as Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra. The musicians that informed the development of her sound would now be considered of an older style of singing, she said, and one that glorified different aspects of music than listeners are accustomed to today.
“It was this style of singing that was really beautiful and often nuanced and always prioritized the lyrics, always getting the message of the song across,” Edmonson said. “The songwriter in those days was much more of a celebrity. I think songwriters aren’t as highly regarded now.”
This is one reason Edmonson prioritizes lyrical content and the sentiment of a song above everything else. The only way for her to gauge the quality of a song is to make it personal, to make it true, she said.
“If a song makes me recall a feeling, whatever it is that I’m writing about, if it affects me that much, I know it’s done its job,” Edmonson said. “So since it affects me, I write from a very personal place.”
Although some of the songs on The Big Picture appear to draw from outwardly somber instances of heartbreak, Edmonson said that she feels a rapid departure in her own development from her second album to her most current effort.
When she wrote the songs for Way Down Low, she felt as the album’s title suggests; she was going through a major transition in her life. Writing those songs was cathartic and helped her heal. Two years later, Edmonson writes from a place of reflection.
“On my new record, I’m in a place of such great joy, so my approach to the sadder songs was really one of a little more perspective,” Edmonson said. “I wasn’t lost in the emotion as much as I was aware of seeing the pain, coming out of it and looking at it from a distance.”
And her perspective is a unique one, too. The lyrics that are more jovial involve language that’s whimsical, full of idyllic simplicity in which she describes life as a dream and meeting lovers at the end of rainbows. If she sounds at all like Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz, full of youthful curiosity, it isn’t an act.
“I really do feel that way, what I describe in my songs, that life is very magical and wondrous,” Edmonson said. “For me that’s the reality, and it is like a movie we’re living in.”
If Edmonson’s dewy, doe-eyed retro pop is her signature genre, her voice is its most critical instrument. At times on the record, specifically the track “Oh My Love,” Edmonson conjures up comparisons to some of jazz’s iconic artists: the warble of Billie Holiday, the rasp of Louis Armstrong and the smoothness of Nat King Cole. Edmonson, though flattered, rejects the similarities, instead opting to think of herself as an interpreter of songs instead of a vocalist.
“I think that has to do with the fact that I always ask, ‘Why?’” Edmonson said. “There’s nothing more important than what the songwriter is trying to get across and why she wrote it in the first place. The vocalist is different.”
In fact, Edmonson, whose honeyed voice gives her music its vitality, confessed that she feels limited by her voice but does as much with it as she possibly can and tries to push the boundaries set before her.
“In the range and the quality of my voice, it’s not a big or robust voice,” she said. “I can’t do a lot of acrobatic things with my voice, but what I can do is be very tender and very emotive.”
The sentiment she offers is tangible. During her debut at Austin City Limits, there were many couples clinging to their significant others and swaying gently as she crooned. She’s even had multiple fans tell her that they played her songs at their weddings, specifically the track “Lucky” from her second LP.
No doubt fans in Los Angeles will demonstrate similar behavior when Edmonson returns to serenade her audience at the landmark Masonic Lodge at Hollywood Forever cemetery tonight.

A battle to the bitter end last Saturday saw the then-No.1 USC men’s water polo team claw its way back from deficit several times against then-No. 3 Stanford. After ultimately falling to the Cardinal by one goal, however, the Trojans (16-3) will look to pick themselves back up once more when they face Loyola Marymount (5-12) today and Pacific (12-7) this Saturday.
King of wings · Redshirt senior driver Rex Butler had four goals in the Trojans’ loss to Stanford last week and will look to lead USC past – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The Trojans suffered their third loss of the year and first loss in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference play after a goal in the closing stages gave the Cardinal an 11-10 victory. USC has now lost to all three of the other “Big Four” teams in men’s water polo — Stanford, Cal and UCLA — but with all three losses coming by margins of two goals or less, head coach Jovan Vavic believes his team can only go up from here.
“When you look at the way we played defensively [against Stanford], and that we only lost by one, I think there’s lots of positives,” Vavic said. “I think overall it’s not really a terrible loss. Considering this is the first time we played [the Cardinal], we played them in their own pool and they’re a very experienced team — they haven’t really lost much, and we’re playing with a completely new team — I feel pretty good about our chances next time we play them.”
Today’s game against LMU marks the Trojans’ first meeting of the year with the Lions. Saturday’s matchup against Pacific will be both the USC’s second home game of the year at Uytengsu Aquatic Center and its second time facing the Tigers. The Trojans topped the Tigers in last year’s NCAA Finals to win their sixth straight national championship, and defeated the Tigers in the rematch 10-3 at this season’s Triton Tournament on Sept. 7.
With a chance to get back on the right track against LMU and Pacific, Vavic made better power play defense a focal point for the future, citing the Trojans’ SoCal Tournament title win earlier in the season.
“The reason we won the SoCal Tournament was because our down-man defense was excellent. Excellent,” Vavic said. “In this game, it was terrible. Stanford scored six goals out of eight 6-on-5 opportunities, and that’s a terrible percentage for us. At the same time our 6-on-5 against Stanford was three [goals] out of seven [opportunities]. Those are two areas right there that make a difference in winning and losing — we score one and we stop them once, we win the game.”
Despite never leading in last weekend’s game, the Trojans persisted through multi-goal deficits at the end of both the first and second halves. Redshirt senior driver Rex Butler, who scored late in the fourth quarter against Stanford to equalize the game at 10-all, emphasized the need to remain persistent through the upcoming matchups.
“I think we showed great resilience,” Butler said. “It’s always disappointing to take a loss like that, but the most important thing is to learn from our mistakes and make sure the loss doesn’t go to waste. We’ve got to correct every mistake and move forward.”
As they move forward, the Trojans will want to stave off any potential upsets this week and use the two games to regain their offensive rhythm. Though the team scored ten goals, Stanford goalie Drew Holland tallied 20 saves, which USC senior driver Kostas Genidounias attributed to the Trojans’ own failure to finish at the cage.
“It was really just bad [shooting] by us,” Genidounias said. “In the first half [against Stanford] we were two out of twenty [in shots]. Out of these 18 shots we missed, around 10 to 12 were right on the goalkeeper, so we made him look like a hero when we just didn’t shoot well.”
The Trojans travel to Westchester, California, today to face the Lions starting at 4 p.m. before returning home for their 1 p.m. game Saturday at Uytengsu Aquatics Center.

With a typically obnoxious case of the stomach flu keeping me bedridden for the past few days, I took to mindlessly perusing social media as a means of occupying my time. Shockingly, this undertaking didn’t fit into my mom’s suggested remedy of sleep, fluids and, “You shouldn’t go out so much!” It did, however, help shed some light on the Trojans’ consistently exciting, yet consistently inconsistent, performance on the football field thus far. If my illness was good for anything, it was good to help me remember this simple fact: At USC this season, it’s all about the freshmen.
Let’s back up a little. While taking a look at wide receivers coach Tee Martin’s Instagram account — how I got there is still unclear — I discovered a post-game photo of freshman wideout JuJu Smith and legendary rapper Dr. Dre. The photo struck me as odd, but not for the reasons you might think. Dre is a well-known USC supporter and one of the namesakes of the school’s Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy. Seeing him on the Trojans’ sideline is as normal as noticing celebrity regulars such as Will Ferrell and Snoop Dogg.
No, for whatever reason, it was Smith who seemed out of place. This made hardly any sense, considering that aside from established standout Nelson Agholor, Smith has the most receptions of any Trojan this season. Though Smith’s face might not be recognizable to most USC fans just six games into his college career, his name is. But, the more I considered how quickly the youngster has transitioned from being just another name in a promising recruiting class to the linchpin of an underrated receiving corps, the more I realized that I had taken his youth for granted.
Smith is just the tip of the iceberg. There’s versatile cornerback/wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson, stud tight end Bryce Dixon, human mountains at the offensive line in Viane Talamaivao and Toa Lobendahn, wide receiver Ajene Harris and key rotational pieces in the secondary such as John Plattenburg and Jonathan Lockett. All of them contributors. All of them true freshman. And I might as well have forgotten.
It all started in the season opener against Fresno State. Leading up to the game, it was unclear how much any of these freshmen would contribute. Over the summer, my fellow columnists and I debated this exact question. I felt Dixon would be a major factor in the passing game, which he has been of late. I also theorized that Smith would have to fight for playing time in crowded groups at defensive back and receiver. Shows how much I know. Smith had four receptions for 123 yards against the Bulldogs, while Dixon and Jackson both caught touchdowns. Lobendahn, Talamaivao and fellow freshman guard Damien Mama all saw time on the offensive line, a historic moment for a program that prides itself on earning everything you get. Though it wasn’t always at the flashiest positions, there was a legitimate youth movement at the Coliseum.
Still, it hasn’t all been smooth sailing for the Trojans’ freshmen. The experienced Stanford defense frustrated Smith. Lobendahn, Mama and Talamaivao have paved the way for redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen all season but struggled to keep redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler off of the turf against Boston College. Harris lost his starting position before the Fresno State game and still has only four catches on the year. But if these freshmen have been right there for USC’s worst moments of 2014, they’ve also been there for the best. Dixon and Smith pulled down three of Kessler’s school-record seven touchdown passes against Colorado on Saturday. Lockett and Plattenburg fearlessly relieved Jackson in the fourth quarter of a crucial win over Arizona. Jackson racked up a career-high seven tackles in the same game before going down to injury.
Maybe there’s a reason why I’ve taken all these freshmen for granted. They contribute, sure, but they aren’t flashy. They don’t complain about playing time or make mental mistakes. They just go out and do what they can to help the team. As a unit, their strongest asset is that they don’t play — or act — like freshmen at all.
So thank you, Tee Martin. Thank you, Instagram. Thank you, stomach flu and its subsequent medicinal haze. Now I know what I should’ve known all season: As the class of 2014 goes, so goes the USC football team — and it will be like that for years to come.

The Trojans continued to gear up at practice Wednesday for their matchup with the Utah Utes. In preparation for the game, USC is focused on stopping Utah’s ground-and-pound attack.
Hold the line · Junior defensive end and preseason All-American Leonard Williams will look to lead USC’s front seven as they face the Utes and their running back Devontae Booker, who has seven touchdowns this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Ready, Set, Stop
Utah’s offense up to this point has been rather transparent, as the Utes continue to be extremely run-heavy. This approach can be attributed to the skill of their powerful running back Devontae Booker.
“I think he runs angry,” USC head coach Steve Sarkisian said of Booker. “I think he appears to almost get stronger as the game goes on. Our defensive front has a tall order this week.”
The defense appears to be up to the challenge and hopes to use a newfound motivation and attitude to stop the running attack.
“The running back is a pretty good back,” said junior defensive end Leonard Williams. “We’re looking forward to a big, physical-type game.”
With such a relentless downfield rushing approach, the Trojans know that all 11 men on the field have to approach the ball and do their job. Booker’s ability to break arm tackles means that USC will have to secure wrap-up tackles and get to the ball quickly.
Finding a Groove
Sarkisian was encouraged by Wednesday’s practice and was pleased with the energy that the team brought to practice heading into Saturday’s game. Sarkisian also praised some of his players for being leaders and setting the tone in practice.
“I think we have some natural leaders that kind of set the tone through the way they practice,” Sarkisian said. The head coach cited the efforts of junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor, freshman wide receiver Juju Smith, redshirt junior running back Javorius “Buck” Allen and senior outside linebacker J.R. Tavai. “I think they really set the tone and the other guys have followed them.”
Past the midway point in the season, the Trojans are starting to find their niche and identity as a team.
“I think the running game took shape a little quicker than the passing game,” Sarkisian said. “We are unique to some degree offensively in the fact that we do go up tempo, but we do still have pro-style principles. It takes time to bring all of that together, but I think we’re hitting our stride as a team at the right time.”
Sophomore outside linebacker Su’a Cravens is also coming into his own after getting another interception in the game against Colorado. Cravens’ coverage skills have been a bright spot in the Trojans’ defense this season.
“When they throw it on my side, I’m going to try and make a play on it,” Cravens said. “Whenever they test me, I take it to my heart. I take it personally.”
Cravens is also excited to play in a hostile environment on the road.
“I love a big crowd, especially in an away game like this. I love when the crowd’s booing us and when it’s loud,” Cravens said. “We shouldn’t let the crowd get to us, and I’m going to talk to the freshmen and tell them ‘don’t let the crowd get to you, just play your game.’”
Injury Update
Injuries have plagued the Trojans throughout the season, but some of the injured players were able to see some more productivity in practice Wednesday.
Redshirt senior linebackers Hayes Pullard and Gerald Bowman were both more active in practice, and freshman wide receiver Ajene Harris and redshirt junior wide receiver George Farmer were limited but participated on Wednesday. Redshirt freshman wide receiver Steven Mitchell was pulled from practice, as he suffered an injury that Sarkisian described as a “twing.”
Redshirt junior fullback Soma Vainuku was limited as well, but Sarkisian was hopeful that he could play Saturday.
Freshman starting cornerback Adoree’ Jackson fully participated in practice and looked good to go for the entire game on Saturday.
“I’m 100 percent,” Jackson said. “I feel great. I feel like it’s day one.”

Meet Oxana and Pavel Rucsineanu. The couple met and fell in love at a tuberculosis clinic in Moldova. Oxana was cured of her TB, but Pavel found he had developed a form of drug-resistant TB. The drugs that Pavel needed existed, but because of price and Moldovan laws, were unavailable to him. So, the government continued to give him incorrect drugs. Oxana refused to accept this. She began lobbying the Moldovan government to make the right drugs affordable and accessible to Pavel. Within a year, not only was Oxana able to get the correct drugs for Pavel, but she was also able to change Moldovan policies so that others like Pavel could access and afford the drugs as well.
Oxana and Pavel’s story has a happy ending, but the injustices the couple faced are not uncommon. The costs of healthcare are crippling. Health laws remain broken. And millions still die each year from a lack of medicines and basic health services. This is not a health issue. This is not a question of privilege. This is a human rights battle.
At the turn of the millennium, some world leaders sought to address these challenges by creating the Millennium Development Goals, which aimed to alleviate poverty and improve global health by the year 2015. Sure, the MDGs put global health on the map, but have the MDGs been an effective framework for global health? No. World leaders still fail to allocate proper health resources to all citizens, and citizens still fail to understand their rights to healthcare.
We have the opportunity to change this. On Oct. 25, people in hundreds of communities across the globe will come together for the first ever Global Day of Action for the Right to Health. The 25th Article of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights reads, “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family,” and on Oct. 25, groups around the world will not only launch local movements to make Article 25 a reality in their communities, but also ignite a global movement for access to proper healthcare to become a universal reality.
This movement comes at a critical moment. Since the U.N. General Assembly meeting last month, world leaders have begun negotiations on a new set of post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals. The coming months present an opportunity to demand that world leaders make the right to health and universal health care a priority on the global stage. This commitment, made at the highest level, would drive national and local policy agendas over the ensuing years to finally make the right to health a reality.
Fourteen years ago, good intentions were made through the MDGs. Yet, maternal health still suffers. Children go to schools with no desks or supplies. People might not be hungry but they might be malnourished. Programs like The U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief supported AIDS treatment, but also promoted abstinence-only education. Good intentions are not good enough. What good is delivering half of the truth? What good is building hospitals when there aren’t doctors to fill them? What good is providing medical equipment if there isn’t proper training? What good is creating medications that aren’t affordable to the people who need them most? What good is failing to address that health is a basic human right? This is a global injustice. This needs to stop. To hell with good — this calls for exemplary.
On Oct. 25, join people like Oxana and Pavel in the fight to make healthcare accessible and affordable in every corner of the world. Empower the world, inspire real change and ignite a movement for the right to health.

Right to Healthcare?  How about a right to free auto insurance, a right to discounted life insurance, and a right to free housekeeping?  There are rights and there are rights.  Let’s please try to keep them straight.
Everyone has a right to life and equal protection under the law, however there is no right to healthcare or any other service that is provided by another human being. To require services from me is to say that I do not own my own labor. Is indentured servitude back in vogue?
No, it isn’t that simple. Everyone has to pay taxes to various levels of government. That does indeed “require services from you” and it does say that you do not own all the fruits of your labor. But if people did not pay taxes, we would live in a ferocious, dog-eat-dog jungle. 
     So what is the real question?  How much health care do people deserve at the cost of others paying for it? And how much do they deserve if their history is that they do not themselves pay taxes because they cannot work, will not work, or are not even in our country and its health system legally?

Two months ago, Said Boumedouha, deputy director of Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Programme, said, “The recent increase in executions is a deeply disturbing deterioration. The authorities must act immediately to halt this cruel practice.” Considering the context of the current situation in the Middle East, Boumedouha might appear to be referring to the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. With four high-profile cases of beheading at the hands of the terrorist organization, the group has become increasingly dangerous in past months.
Linda Xu | Daily Trojan
 
And yet, the comment wasn’t about ISIS — Boumedouha was talking about Saudi Arabia.
While the rest of the world is preoccupied with ISIS, the epidemic of Ebola, the crisis in Ukraine and other global news, few have been paying attention to the egregious human rights violations taking place in the oil-rich kingdom. Saudi Arabia has executed 59 people this year alone, yet it hasn’t appeared much on media in the U.S. or abroad. Change needs to happen.
Defenders of the practice view the executions as a non-issue, citing the recent turmoil in the region as a reason for the country to flex its muscles and demonstrate to the region and world its strength and resolve. The idea that a country needs to kill its people to showcase its prowess is antiquated and troubling. Whether a country holds Western values or not, the execution of individuals on a large scale because of insignificant crimes is intolerable. It’s not a political issue — it’s a human rights one.
Since 1985, more than 2,000 people have been executed in Saudi Arabia. Yet, the numbers do not even tell the whole story. The country has beheaded people under charges such as adultery and sorcery. If a country in the Middle East were beheading people for non-lethal crimes, one would think that the U.S. would be in arms about this — but it’s not, for reasons that are utterly hypocritical.
Saudi Arabia is the great supplier of oil for the world and one of the wealthiest nations in the world. It is also a strategic ally of the U.S. in the region, and in fact is a key leader in the fight against the Islamic State. As a result, it would be disadvantageous for the U.S. or any country to attempt to break such a critical alliance. Politically speaking, it makes sense to maintain the status quo, but this isn’t just some comment or remark. These are beheadings and executions maintained by a powerful country that essentially excuses itself from international law. The U.S. and the global community need to cut the rhetoric and recognize the abuses and killings happening in Saudi Arabia. Though the kingdom is a strong ally in the fight against ISIS, it also needs to be held accountable for its actions. The U.S., in vowing to eliminate the threat of ISIS while ardently currying the favor of an oil lord, is guilty of the very crimes it decries.
If the U.S. doesn’t stay consistent with the values it stands for, it shouldn’t pick and choose which countries it wishes to align with and which to fight. It is important for the international community to hold a standard to which all countries are held accountable to, not a policy for which an elite few are exempt. Saudi Arabia is essentially trying to stop ISIS from committing the same crimes that the nation is guilty of. For decades, Saudi Arabia has been under the radar in terms of its execution trends, simply because countries don’t want to bite the hand that feeds them. The fight against ISIS offers a unique opportunity to deal with the controversy of Saudi Arabia’s beheadings.
The world needs to pay closer attention to countries that endanger human rights. In an increasingly globalized world connected by the Internet and social media, nothing should be allowed to escape under the radar.

“To clarify: Wahhabism is the only officially
recognized and allowed religion in Saudi Arabia. Other forms of Islam and other
religions are banned and persecuted by the state. 
Saudi Arabia is the only Islamic state in which there is no
church, no synagogue and no other place of worship of any other religion. 
Shiite Muslims have been systematically discriminated
against for decades. Jews are even forbidden to enter the Kingdom. 
Saudi Arabia practices a form of Sharia law that is one of
the most brutal systems in the world. Saudi Arabia has at all times rejected
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948. 
Women may not drive a car and can be punished by flogging.
Corporal punishment, including amputations and executions, are part of everyday
life in the country. Just two weeks ago a Sudanese immigrant in Saudi Arabia
was publicly beheaded for ‘sorcery.’ Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries
in the world in which the death penalty is enforced even on teenagers,”
the paper said.
Muslims do not abide by man made laws (international laws) but only to Sharia law.  Sharia law and Islam are inseparable.  This is why many Muslim countries refuse to sign the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Islam is, in fact, a religion incompatible with international laws and, for that matter, it is incompatible with our Constitution too.
