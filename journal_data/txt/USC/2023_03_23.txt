Divya Jakatdar and Michelle Lu emerged from the 2023 Undergraduate Student Government election as the president- and vice-president-elect after earning 38.1% of cast votes. But a commonly abysmal turnout — just 19.5% of all undergraduates, a 2% drop from last year’s turnout — had some students, surveyed and interviewed by the Daily Trojan, voicing concerns about a disconnect between their elected officials and the rest of the student body.
The Daily Trojan sent a survey to undergraduate students March 1 regarding their participation in the recent elections, their thoughts on USG in general as well as their outreach. The survey received 31 responses. 
Respondents were first asked if they had voted in the recent election, to which 61.3% said yes. 41.7% of those who did not vote said that they “did not want to.” An additional 25% of respondents said that they did not know how, 8.3% said that they had no time and another 8.3% said that it was because they did not know anything about the candidates. The final 16.6% of respondents provided their own answers, including one who said that they were not aware the election was happening in the first place. 
When it came to the candidates and their policies, respondents appeared to be rather in the dark. On a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is “very uninformed” and 5 is “very informed,” the average answer was a 2.4, with 38.7% of respondents choosing 1. Respondents said that any information they did get was obtained mostly from campus media such as the Daily Trojan (22%), social media (19%) and friends (6%). Sixteen percent of respondents said that they were unable to find information about the candidates and their policies.
Another aspect that may have led to a further lack of candidate information is that only 19% of respondents said that they had watched the USG Presidential Debate. The same proportion said that they did not watch it but had read a recap later, and 61% said that they did not watch the debate at all. Of those who did not watch the debate, the most common reasons were “I did not want to” (48%), “I had no time” (24%) and not knowing the debate was occurring (22%). 
Respondents’ knowledge of the voting process fared only slightly better, as the average answer on the same 1-5 scale was a 2.7. The most common rating on this question was again a 1. Information on the voting process, respondents said, was found largely through social media (41%), friends (16%) and campus media (6.5%). An additional 22.6% of respondents said that they were unable to find information on the voting process.
Emmett Liljegren, a sophomore majoring in human biology, said this was the first time he had voted, and only because he had a personal connection to one of the candidates. 
“I usually don’t vote at all because I feel like I don’t really know what’s going on or care about it,” Liljegren said. “But this year, one of my good friends was running for vice president, so I wanted to vote for her.” 
Lex Yu, a junior majoring in computer science games and President of USC Queers in Engineering, Science, and Technology, said they only learned about the elections when several candidates reached out to them about coming to speak at a club meeting. They added, however, that the candidate platforms seemed to be lacking. 
“In the emails that [the candidates] sent they didn’t clearly state their platform,” Yu said. “They were kind of the same thing … ‘we care about accessibility’ or whatever. But that’s so vague.”
Yu said because of this, they resorted mainly to other modes of searching for election information.
“I found most of the information through Instagram or through the Google Doc links that were on the voting website when the voting opened,” they said. “So I just read the Google Docs on the day of voting.”
Other than election knowledge, general knowledge of USG itself appears to be low. Just under half (48%) of respondents could not name any USG initiatives from this school year and an additional 22.6% were unsure if they could name one. Even some of those who offered names of initiatives either wrongly attributed them to USG or named one that is not yet in place, such as the digital ID cards promised by many campaigns this election cycle. 
On a related subsequent question, respondents indicated that they felt USG may not be aware of student needs. Just over 38% said that they felt USG was not aware of student needs, 35% said that they were unsure and only 25% said that they felt USG was aware. 
Andalib Maani, a freshman majoring in English creative writing, said that part of the reason for his disinterest in voting this year was because the candidates did not speak on issues that were important to him.
“I don’t remember any of them speaking on sanitary issues,” Maani said, “especially regarding cafeterias and dorms.”
Liljegren said he thinks the issue of USG’s potential disconnect from the student body may be because of a lack of transparency.
“The issue is every time else in the year in which nobody has any idea what USG is doing, because I feel like they don’t send out updates, they don’t send out any explanation of what they do,” he said. “The only thing that I know that they do is they fund other student orgs … I feel like a lot of people just don’t care because they don’t know what they do.”
Liljegren said he only felt somewhat informed this year because of his friend that was running for office and that even upon further research he could not find much information on prior USG work. 
“I looked back at the campaign promises and the presidents from the year before just because I was curious,” he said. “I have no idea if these people actually did any of these things that they said they were going to do.”
Both Liljegren and Yu said that they didn’t know until recently that USG’s president and vice president were paid positions. Yu in particular said that they thought this should be something that is communicated more clearly to students. 
“There should be more transparency from both the school and from USG about funding and money allocation within USG,” they said. “I didn’t know that it’s basically a job … more students should be aware of that because I think most people don’t know that there’s so much money involved with USG.” 
Ultimately, Liljegren thinks that USG means well but isn’t necessarily doing enough to connect with their constituents.
“The people in USG have the best intention, and they’re trying to make the Uuniversity a better place,” Liljegren said. “I just wish that there was more communication and more outreach done … because I feel like everybody in USG knows everybody in USG enough like their group and they don’t really expand outside of that.” 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Omar Habhab, chair of USG’s Elections Commission, said that USG is working to improve their connection with the student body.
“Before my involvement with USG, I really didn’t know what USG was,” Habhab said. “I fully relate to those students who don’t really understand what USG is. But after my involvement, I realized the primary goal that USG aims for is bridging this gap between the org and the student body.”
Habhab said the Elections Commission recommended beginning campaign workshops and outreach earlier in the year to give the candidates and USG in general more time to speak to other students. He acknowledged, however, that the job is still very difficult. 
“From personal experience after being involved with the org and working to promote civic engagement with election season,” he said, “I realized no matter how much effort and work you produce, it’s going to be very challenging to reach the entire student body.”

I’m from San Jose, California — specifically from Seven Trees, a neighborhood in the Southside that greatly resembles South Central. Both of these communities don’t fit the cookie-cutter image of the imagined extravagant cities in the Bay Area or Los Angeles County. Seven Trees is “unsafe” — due to historically high levels of gang activity. Seven Trees is “dirty” — because of the tent-lined sidewalks and trash-filled roads. 
However, a less than 10-minute drive outside of the area are spotless streets, even pavements and gated communities planted on the San Jose hills — the contrast of the comfortable living becomes stark, almost saddening. 
Moving to L.A., I see the same thing. As neighborhoods like Seven Trees and South Central undergo gentrification, the communities’ needs become erased. 
Within a one mile radius of USC, eight apartments are directly mentioned on their individual websites to be “luxury housing” or have a “luxurious” style. These complexes include The Lorenzo, The Hub, The 505, 3025 Mansion, Oasis at the Row, The Riviera Luxe and Tuscany Apartments. Five of the eight alone were built within the last two years, with The Hub on South Figueroa Street and Oasis on 2714 Portland St to be constructed by Fall 2023. 
The average minimum rent for a USC freshman is more than $1,700, which comes with a dining hall plan with unlimited swipes. In comparison, the minimum average rent for the complexes that provide a two-bedroom, four-person floor plan is $1,412. However, according to the Education Data Initiative, the average cost of food per month for a college student is $667, pushing the off-campus cost for “luxury living” to more than $2,000. 
These abnormally high prices are justified by complexes’ modern, high-end building amenities. Yet, they act as glamorized dorms. For example, the 3025 Mansion is installing a new pilates studio for the upcoming school year. And a glance at The Lorenzo’s website shows their advertisement for their spa as its own amenity category.
However, true luxury, I discovered, is personal space. How my mom and I combatted the rising rent prices of Silicon Valley is staying at a run-down townhouse that we shared with our immediate family members. I distinctly remember that, at one point in my life, there were eight of us crammed into the three-bedroom, one-bathroom complex. Basic activities became hard to do with someone constantly in your space — studying, eating, even relaxing. I’m aware that multigenerational homes are part of Asian culture, but this wasn’t a choice we made willingly.
Financially struggling students lack this luxury — having roommates and suitemates, staying in an unfurnished, run-down space or commuting with a car or public transportation. The burden always falls on the students to make internal trade-offs to make ends meet.
While the University, “[does not] endorses or approves the landlord, its properties or business practices” of these apartments and various others, it continues to have them on its Off-Campus Housing 101 website — ads that apartment complexes pay for with their “first 30-day listing free of charge.”
The University should increase the off-campus financial aid given, which is usually an underestimate of what students actually need. With the recent $848 million investment for a Washington, D.C., campus, the money could’ve been allocated for building more off-campus housing, creating an off-campus housing infrastructure or giving students more money to live. 
Even then, student’s financial aid is often miscalculated. In a survey conducted by Calmatters in 2019, researchers found discrepancies between the estimated costs and actual housing costs of California students. In using an older method of financial estimation, “the estimated monthly housing cost for a student living with their family in the 2020-21 school year would have been $369. The survey put it at $509.”
It feels as though there is a lack of understanding from the University regarding the significance of money as a dictator of decisions. Students shouldn’t need to negotiate their desires for comfort, privacy and safety to make attending USC affordable. USC is not a neutral party in the student housing crisis. The lack of affordable and accessible on-campus housing and its implicit cooperation with these management companies only exacerbate the issue.
Students don’t need luxury. We just need a place to live without it costing an arm and a leg.

Growing up in a predominantly Asian/Asian American community, my ethnicity as a Chinese American woman was never an issue. So, when I came to USC, I experienced a culture shock. People have assumed that I don’t speak English or that the foreign language I chose to take is Chinese. These are examples of microaggressions — thinly veiled, everyday instances of racism, homophobia, sexism and more that you see in the world that are often subtle or unintentional. 
Although most of the perpetrators mean no harm, they still use stereotypes to categorize me and make assumptions based off of those categorizations. I often find myself brushing these comments off. I used to think that these comments were simple misunderstandings and were not significant enough for me to speak up. 
Although the term “micro” in microaggressions may suggest otherwise, these actions have lasting, negative impacts on their recipients and can’t be disregarded.
Macroaggressions, on the other hand, are often at the forefront of the conversation about racism. However, their ‘micro’ counterparts can be just as harmful in marginalizing people of color. According to BBC, “A slow accumulation of these microaggressions can lead to low self-esteem, feelings of alienation and eventually even mental health issues, researchers warn. They can also create a toxic work environment.”
In terms of my experiences as a student at USC, the University does thankfully recognize microaggressions as a problem, even claiming to “Foster a community of diverse viewpoints in order to build a generation of innovators, leaders, visionaries and creators.” However, the  preventative actions they choose to implement are rather passive. The Sol Price School of Public Policy has uploaded a booklet of micro intervention strategies. Moreover, there is a whole page dedicated to resources for students, faculty and staff to report wrongdoings. 
There are also workshops that are offered such as The Justice Equity Diversity Inclusion’s JEDI 102: Implicit Bias and Microaggressions. Although providing resources is a necessary part of preventing microaggressions, these passive solutions require an individual to be actively seeking additional support about an encounter that may have already been extremely upsetting.
The University should take more active approaches to fight microaggressions by requiring students, faculty and staff to learn about these actions and what they can do to prevent them. For example, The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism has core courses that are mandatory for all media center students, faculty and staff. These courses raise awareness by having courses such as Interrupting and Confronting Explicit Acts of Racism and Sexism in the Newsroom. 
These classes are extremely beneficial to the USC community, but they need to be implemented on a more wide-scale level. USC should require all its students, faculty and staff to take at least one workshop about microaggressions every year to ensure that this topic isn’t disregarded. The University can also require its clubs and organizations to also have meetings addressing xenophobia — micro and macro aggressions. 
As a student and person of color at this University, I want the school to take more direct approaches to combat microaggressions. Race should not negatively impact anyone’s life. By enforcing more active methods, USC can create a safer, hospitable environment for all of its members to thrive in.

Los Angeles Unified School District workers braved the Wednesday morning rain to picket on the corner of 36th Street and Vermont Avenue. 
The rally of some 30 service employees and teachers, most of whom work at South L.A. campuses, was part of an ongoing three-day strike of tens of thousands of LAUSD workers that has captured the nation’s attention. Passing cars sounded frequent honks of support for the group, which joined larger protests in the city later in the day.
District service workers, including bus drivers, janitors, food-service staff and special education assistants — under the banner of the Service Employees International Union Local 99 — are calling for a 30% pay raise and an additional $2 per hour for the union’s lowest-paid employees. Additional demands include more full-time hours, elimination of unpaid furlough days, equitable access to healthcare and resolution of staff shortages.
The teachers’ union is striking in solidarity, grinding operations across the nation’s second-largest school district to a halt. LAUSD serves more than 565,000 students across over a thousand campuses.
“We’re overworked, we’re overwhelmed, we’re short staffed,” said Liliana Carpio, a classified employee who works with special education students. “It’s time that they treat us fairly and the way we deserve to be treated.”
This week’s strike, which began on Tuesday and is limited to just three days, is in protest of what SEIU Local 99 characterized as the district’s “harassment and intimidation of workers,” as opposed to being a prolonged tactic meant to force the district to agree to a set of demands. The union’s website notes, however, that an open-ended strike could happen in the future. 
For a brief moment last weekend, a Hail Mary legal effort offered a possible out: LAUSD leadership asked the California Public Employment Relations Board for an injunction Friday, arguing that a strike would be illegal because the stated justification was not the real reason for the walkout. The board tossed that argument Sunday.
“I was out here in 2019 fighting for the same stuff,” said John Dvorkin, a first grade teacher at Lenicia B. Weemes Elementary School, referring to the six-day teachers’ strike that year that resulted in a 6% pay raise.
Dvorkin said he explained the strike to his students — who learned about the civil rights movement of the 1960s earlier this year, so are aware of the concept of protests — but few asked any questions.
“Los Angeles Unified has made a historically generous offer to SEIU Local 99 which exceeds local, state and national comparisons,” the district wrote on its website. “We are doing everything we can to reach an agreement that is equitable, fiscally responsible and reflects the dignity of our tremendous employees.”

The European Union’s ambassador to the United States, Stavros Lambrinidis, visited USC Wednesday for a talk hosted by the Center for the Political Future, where he discussed issues ranging from the war in Ukraine to economic integration and modern global interconnectedness. 
Lambrinidis, who was born in Greece, studied economics and political science at Amherst College and law at Yale University before going on to hold a variety of prominent roles in the Greek government and European Union. He has served as foreign affairs minister of Greece, the EU special representative for human rights and vice president of the European Parliament, among other roles. 
“Human rights is not a footnote in our foreign policy,” said Lambrinidis of the European Union. “It’s not soft politics. It is hardcore foreign policy as far as we are concerned because preventing major conflicts or resolving them once they start is hugely important for the security of Europe.” 
Speaking on the special relationship between the U.S. and EU that he focuses on in his current role, Lambrinidis characterized the two as the “strongest open economies in the world” while recognizing the dislike of some citizens toward the partnership.
“There are complaints on both sides of the Atlantic about unfair competition,” Lambrinidis said. “The vast majority of that economic relationship is supremely beneficial. In this country alone, about seven to eight million jobs have been created by European Union company investments.”
Another popular foreign policy issue discussed was Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has greatly impacted lives across the EU and U.S. While, in the U.S., 40% of Republican and 15% of Democratic members of Congress believe the U.S. has given too much aid to fend off attacks from the Russian military, much of Europe is united in their unwavering support for their neighbor. 
Lambrinidis said the difference in support originated from the European psyche following the events of the Holocaust and World War II. 
“Europeans made a decision that we would never ever allow ourselves either the means or the desire to perpetrate such atrocities against us or anywhere else in the world,” he said. “Putin today … made an entirely different decision that it will continue using force to expand and bring us back to the bloody days over the past.”
Lambrinidis pushed for more American empathy toward the war and consideration of the broader global implications of the conflict. 
“Please mark my words,” he said. “There’s no safe distance when an autocrat sitting on nuclear weapons is convinced that he can bend the will of our leaders and our people through force. If he succeeds, this [will become] a very different world than the one that we know. America’s and Europe’s capacity to project our democracy and our power around the world will be destroyed for decades to come. This is not a war that is far away.”
Lambrinidis said it was important for young people in the U.S. to find common identity and shared values in the EU in order to aid the continuation of such a historic partnership. 
U.S. and EU citizens “are not just somewhere out there, but fundamentally intertwined into the fabric of what we have been building together for the past centuries,” he said. “This is an alliance that is so much deeper than money.”
Lawrence Sung, a sophomore majoring in international relations global business, said in an interview with the Daily Trojan that he was deeply inspired by Lambrinidis’s words. 
“The biggest thing I took away from [the talk] is that there’s still hope, in terms of upholding the values of human rights, democracy and liberty,” Sung said. “Despite everything that’s going on right now, we should continue to aspire to hold ourselves up to these awesome values and keep on fighting the good fight.”
Kamy Akhavan, CPF executive director, said he was thrilled to be able to host Lambrinidis on campus and bring his message to students. 
“He showed us how much we have in common as human beings even though we’re an ocean apart,” Akhavan said. “I found that unity very enlightening and even comforting … Through empathy and education, the things that we’re promoting here at USC, we can make the world a better place.”

The USC Ski & Snowboard club team competed in the National Championships at Mammoth Mountain, held March 7 to 9. Junior Chloe Barker stomped her way to first in freestyle individual for women’s snowboarding, claiming the title of National Champion. She also clinched two third-place spots in boarder-cross and individual combined. Junior Shane Cole placed fifth overall in men’s ski individual combined, securing seventh and 13th place finishes in skier-cross and slopestyle, respectively. In the men’s snowboard division, junior Jesse Tennant and graduate student Gelo Winings threw down to clinch ninth in freestyle team combined and 12th in alpine team combined.
The national competition, sponsored by the United States Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association, draws over 500 student-athletes from across the nation each year. Inclement weather and strong snowstorms resulted in a compressed competition schedule and the cancellation of most events, as the championship was initially slated for March 6 to 11. 
With new challenges and competition, Nationals not only tested the team’s abilities but their resilience, too.
“A lot of the schools we were competing against, especially with racing, train skiers throughout the season,” Cole said. “Our team doesn’t get to do that — I tried working with some of the teams at Mammoth, but I couldn’t get any lane space for us to train this past season.”
In addition to the pressure posed by new competitors, the climate proved challenging, as well.
“We were really impacted by having a reduced amount of events,” Tennant said. “Everybody who could, competed in boarder-cross or skier-cross, which we had never done before. The fact that we finished third and seventh in our first boarder-cross is incredible.”
Barker acknowledged the advantage of a “send it” mindset at Nationals.
“A lot of it is just showing up and trying something new,” Barker said. “The one event I had was boarder-cross — I absolutely despise that event, but I knew it was going to be the only event they wouldn’t cancel. I didn’t come all this way to not compete in anything, and I actually did really well. If it comes down to it, try something new and push yourself. You never know what’s going to happen.” 
For Cole, focusing on fun more than fierce repetitions is key to keeping a fighting spirit.
“I competed in skiing at a really high level growing up. I got some injuries and burnt out from it, so I’ve really been focusing on having as much fun as possible and competing when I can,” Cole said. “Next season is going to be the same thing.”
A supportive dynamic helps keep the team on track. When nerves threaten to derail the day, Tennant turns to his teammates.
“A lot of people get in their head[s], but once you actually get to the event, people definitely start to loosen up, especially after the first run,” Tennant said. “It’s helpful having all your friends there supporting you — all that stress melts away, and we remember why we’re out here.”
Looking forward to the team’s future, the athletes are focused on diversity and outreach efforts in recruitment. 
“Last year, it was just me and one other girl competing. But this year, we had four of us competing, so I liked how more people were able to make it,” Barker said. “That was really fun — to see more of us represented in different events.” 
Her goals are twofold: to increase women athletes’ participation and decrease financial barriers.
“Next year will be my last year,” Barker said. “My goal for the team is to get more people involved with competing because it’s a rewarding experience. It makes you a better skier or snowboarder, and this particular league is open to all levels. It can really help improve your riding, and it’s just so much fun, especially when you have a team like USC’s.”
As a team officer, Barker said she hopes to decrease the wealth-opportunity gap. The competition commitment requires many more days of training and other various fees. The Ikon Pass, a pass providing users access to anywhere from 39 to 55 resorts worldwide, can cost up to $1,159. Combined with expensive gear and the opportunity cost of lost time and funds, wallet elasticity is often a prerequisite to competing. 
“We’re trying to get more funding for people who want to get into competing, so the money aspect isn’t holding them back from the experience,” Barker said. 
Funds aren’t the only element emphasized by the athletes. Mammoth extended its season to July, as of the time of publication. The resort has seen record snowfall, with total accumulations of 634 inches at Main Lodge and over 800 inches at the summit. 
Riding on massive terrain with motivating competition, the team’s morale was no exception.
“At Nationals, there were schools from all over the country with a lot of athletes. We were definitely a small crew, but we did pretty well and powered through,” Cole said. “Small but mighty.”

After a busy couple of weeks, the following teams have advanced from the round of 16 onto the quarter-finals: S.L. Benfica, F.C. Bayern Munich, Chelsea F.C., A.C. Milan, Manchester City, Inter Milan, Real Madrid and S.S.C. Napoli. Italy leads all countries with three teams still in the running. England has two squads while Germany, Spain and Portugal all have one. 
None of these teams come as much of a surprise. However, Chelsea is the only team out of the eight not currently in a position to qualify for the Champions League, based on their standing in the Premier League. To reach this stage, they defeated one of the current German leaders, Borussia Dortmund. Despite this crucial victory, it is the other English team that has their name in the headlines.
After a disappointing 1-1 draw in the first leg, Manchester City dismantled Red Bull Leipzig 7-0 in the second leg. Earling Haaland, City’s new striker, tallied 5 goals before being substituted in the 63rd minute. He joins Lionel Messi and Luiz Adriano to score 5 goals in a single Champions League match.  Only 22 years old, Haaland is showing promise that he is on his way to becoming one of the game’s next greatest players.
In the upcoming round, the club will see some familiar faces as they face off against Bayern. Although the German side has had more European success, both sides have been unable to capitalize on their chances in the UCL as of late. In their round of 16 tie, Bayern handled business against Paris Saint Germain 3-0 through two legs. Missing some star power after Neymar’s injury, PSG simply could not break through Bayern’s defense in 180 minutes. PSG now goes back to the drawing board after failing to win despite spending 147.5 million Euros during the transfer window.
In the most uneventful matchup this round, AC Milan defeated Tottenham 1-0 through two legs. It was Brahim Diaz’s goal in the seventh minute of the first game that proved to be the difference between the two clubs. AC Milan will face a familiar foe in Napoli as they return to the quarter-finals for just the second time since winning the tournament in 2007. Napoli reached the quarter-finals in dominant fashion after defeating Eintracht Frankfurt 5-0 on aggregate. This tie will be the one to watch as an immovable force faces an unstoppable object. Who will break first and have to abandon their game plan?
One of the surprises of the tournament so far, Benfica has exceeded the low expectations that were placed on them. They were able to go undefeated in a group that featured European giants PSG and Juventus. Benfica continued in their winning days against Club Brugge as they demolished them 7-1 on aggregate. Most years, there is a club outside of Europe’s top five leagues that makes a Cinderella run, and it appears that this rendition of the tournament is no different. Inter is the one that stands in their way of a semi-final appearance. If this is going to be a competitive matchup, Inter is going to have to shake off its rough form as of late. They are winless in the last four of their five matches in all competitions. Their round of 16 draw was very similar to AC Milan’s with only one goal being scored, except they faced a far less formidable opponent in Porto.
Lastly, the previous two champions of the UCL face off in what should be must-see television for soccer fans across the globe. Chelsea and Real Madrid will play for the first time since the 2021-22 campaign, which ended with Real Madrid claiming one of their 14 UCL titles. To get to this stage, Real Madrid cruised by Liverpool 6-2 on aggregate. On the other hand, Chelsea’s road was not so easy, as they were forced to come from behind to take Dortmund down in the second leg back in London. Regardless of their road to get to where they are today, both clubs are known for putting in solid performances in the Champions League, so the world is waiting in anticipation to see who will emerge victorious after 180 minutes.
As the contest starts to approach the end, player fitness becomes a crucial talking point if you want to correctly predict a winner. If a club is challenging for a league title, domestic cups and European cups all at the same time, the starters will become fatigued very easily and may not play as well as expected. It is important to have good depth and prioritize which trophy they can lift at the end of the season so there can be an effective strategy. That being said, here are my predictions for who will reach the semi-finals. I believe Real Madrid, Benfica, Manchester City and AC Milan will survive and advance in their matchups.

If there is only one show you are going to watch this semester, you might as well make it “The Last of Us.” “You mean the one with the zombies?” my friend asks me over breakfast, busy as I am raving about it to everyone else at the table. To simply call it “the show with zombies” would be doing it a great disservice. What creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann have pulled off is nothing short of extraordinary.
Starring Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, HBO’s “The Last of Us” — based on the blockbuster 2013 Naughty Dog video game — is set in a post-apocalyptic America, 20 years after a fungal pandemic has destroyed much of world civilization and humanity. The show follows Joel (Pascal), a hardened smuggler, and Ellie (Ramsey), a bright young girl who may hold the key to a cure, as they travel across a battered America full of infected zombie-like creatures, resistance groups and other unknown threats. Along the way, new friends are made, new enemies are forged, hearts are broken, hearts are mended and lives are forever changed. To say the least, this journey is not easy. 
The first thing viewers will notice is the sheer size and scope of the show. Through dozens upon dozens of massive set pieces, stunning sights and locations, and detailed and intricate designs at every level, production designer John Paino does a fantastic job bringing the world to life, presenting a remarkable kind of beauty to the world’s depression and devastation, grounding “The Last of Us” in realism, shock, awe and serious legitimacy. It is a beautifully constructed and even more beautifully shot show. Cinematographers Ksenia Sereda, Eben Bolter, Christine A. Maier and Nadim Carlsen knock it out of the park with their work, framing the most epic of moments with such wide-eyed wonder and amazement and the most intimate of moments in such deeply moving and personal styles. 
Every single performance is a masterclass. Pascal and Ramsey lead the charge, but it cannot be understated just how fantastic and rewarding every single guest star’s work is on the show. Mazin and Druckmann’s writing is masterful and irresistible, and Gustavo Santaolalla and David Fleming’s music is haunting and unforgettable.
Perhaps where “The Last of Us” succeeds the most is in its pure humanity. It is a show about people and their connectedness in all facets even in the darkest of times. And with that, it is an ugly show. Characters are beyond flawed, choices are beyond nuanced and lines are beyond grayed. And yet, the beauty of humanity and our world is found in that very imperfection.
At its core, the zombies themselves could honestly mean very little to the greater themes of the show. “The Last of Us” is a hopeful and reaffirming meditation on life, a devastating and melancholic eulogy on love, a fascinating experiment on family and a deeply meaningful, shocking and revelatory exploration of what it truly means to survive and how far we are willing to go to save all that we love.
Every episode is a journey, painstakingly crafted to perfection. Mazin and Druckmann go beyond honoring the source material with their passion and faithfulness. Through this adaptation for television, they enrich and improve upon the source material in the best of ways. Each episode left viewers deeper in awe and deeper in love with the world, characters and story of “The Last of Us.” 
It is easily one of the best things to hit television in years, and it is a must-watch for anyone who seeks an emotional, exciting, fulfilling adventure. When entertainment transcends its boundaries, when media transcends its mediums, a story is no longer just about being read, heard, played or watched — it is about being lived. For the past two months, we have lived “The Last of Us,” and I have truly, deeply loved this work of art.

The men’s swim and dive team is ready to compete in the NCAA championships, held in Minneapolis, after a promising performance at the Pac-12 championships. In swimming, sophomore Chris O’Grady finished fifth in the 200-yard breaststroke and sophomore Artem Selin finished 12th in the 50-yard freestyle. O’Grady and Selin both qualified for the NCAAs, with O’Grady set to compete in the 200-yard individual medley and the 100-yard and 200-yard breaststroke, while Selin will swim the 50-yard freestyle. 
“[The] Pac-12 is always kind of a rough meet just because it’s so close to the NCAAs,” O’Grady said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “[But] overall as a team, I think we performed pretty well.”
Though USC will not be able to participate in any of the relays at the NCAAs, O’Grady emphasized the team’s support this season.
“This year, everyone gets along very well with each other, and the team environment has been great,” O’Grady said.
Freshman diver Laurent Gosselin-Paradis also spoke about bonding with his teammates, despite the individual aspect of diving.
“It’s really about supporting each other and being there for each other and cheering on each other no matter what,” Gosselin-Paradis said. “I don’t think I could have had as successful a year without the team.”
The men’s diving team combined to secure a comfortable first-place finish at the Pac-12s. Gosselin-Paradis took first in 1-meter and platform, as well as second in 3-meter. Senior George Korovin placed first in 3-meter and sixth in 1-meter. Sophomore Shangfei Wang finished seventh in 3-meter, and freshman Robert Gref took eighth in 1-meter.
Diving Head Coach Li Hongping expressed his excitement about the success at Pac-12s, referring to the men’s results and senior Nike Agunbiade’s win on women’s platform.
“I really feel a tremendous amount of appreciation and gratitude for what they have done for themselves, for the team, as well as for USC,” Li said. “This has been the best ever [result] from my coaching for the last 24 years. So as their coach, I’m so very proud of their accomplishment and [am] just thrilled to bring such honor back to [USC].”
All four divers who competed in the Pac-12s also qualified for the NCAAs at the Zone E Diving championships. Korovin is set to compete in every event at the NCAAs. Wang qualified for both springboard events and Gref qualified for platform. Gosselin-Paradis is only competing in the 1-meter after missing the other events at Zone E championships due to illness.
“I wasn’t able to compete on 3-meter and platform, which are usually my strongest events. So I’m definitely disappointed about that,” Gosselin-Paradis said. “But I’m also happy to have an easier week and to focus on my weakest event, 1-meter, just to try to make it as strong as I can and as consistent as I can.”
Coach Li stressed the importance of his divers’ personal growth, instead of worrying about competitors.
“I want to avoid mentioning [rankings] because that will distract them from what they need to do in each and every step of their dive,” Li said. “The result will be good if you only focus on the present time, not the future. This is a rewarding moment for them to show [their] last six months of hard training.” 
Gosselin-Paradis said he is dealing with some nerves ahead of his first NCAA championship, but he’s working on staying concentrated.
“I walked in yesterday and felt a little bit overwhelmed because the level of caliber was way more than any competition that I’ve competed in this year, but today I went into practice and just wanted to focus on myself,” Gosselin-Paradis said. “I wasn’t really paying attention to anyone else. It’s been working out so far, so I’m excited.” 
O’Grady expressed a similar mindset, especially with his experience competing in last year’s NCAAs, where he finished 16th in the 200-yard breaststroke. 
“I’m a lot more calm. I’m not really all that anxious about the results,” O’Grady said. “I’m just ready to swim fast.”
O’Grady will start in the 200-yard individual medley on Thursday, along with Selin in the 50-yard freestyle and the qualified divers on 1-meter. Men’s swim and dive will compete through March 25.

In summer camp after sixth grade, the song “Dumb Ways to Die” became stuck in my head. The animated video of the different aforementioned “dumb ways to die” and accompanying song began as an Australian public service announcement. The video was meant to warn people about the dangers of not following rail safety guidelines. 
Still, it seems that the original intent behind the song was never a focus for most people that sang “Dumb Ways to Die” nonstop. Instead, “Dumb Ways to Die” became iconic, mostly because it poked fun at death in imagining situations that simultaneously felt far-off, and yet so realistic. 
Featuring adorable colorful beans getting themselves into dire situations, the animated video and song features lyrics such as “set fire to your hair” and “eat a two-week-old unrefrigerated pie.” The beans are then shown doing exactly those actions. As more “dumb ways to die” are narrated and more beans die, a gradually increasing number of the dead beanies join together, bobbing to the music and dancing along.
It’s cute — morbid, obviously — but also cute and catchy. I catch myself singing this at random times to distract myself from impending events or situations. There’s a hint of fear in there too, one of the unpredictable possibility of death. How do you know if you’re doing something that may be a “dumb way to die?” 
Personally, I do all sorts of dumb things every day, and I’m not sure if any one of those could be a possible route to death. I wouldn’t know until I was dead. By then, it’d be too late; I’d be one of the dancing dead beans.
But I digress. Even though there is that hint of fear in there, “Dumb Ways to Die” does make light of death, a concept that often feels too dark to speak about. Although I treated the song as primarily a humorous jingle when I was younger, I’ve come to respect it more now. Morbidly, it reminds me that I could die at any instant, which makes the everyday stresses of my life — grades, the job hunt and general paranoia about social interactions — feel less magnified of sorts.
It was only recently that I discovered that there was also an accompanying mobile game in the “Dumb Ways to Die” brand. Curious, I downloaded it, wanting to see what I had missed out on when I was younger. 
The game is very much similar to the video in that it features the beans in the situations that can lead to their deaths. Yet here, it’s you, the player, who had the power to prevent their deaths. By clicking and moving your finger on your phone, you can save the beans, even though they’re already in these situations because, well, they’re beans.
The game does somewhat give me an artificial kind of anxiety; I want to click fast enough to save the bean, even though I know that this is just a game and I shouldn’t invest so much effort into it. Yet it also gives me a sense of control, as if I have this illusory control over death. Therefore, rather than contributing to my anxiety, the memory of listening to “Dumb Ways to Die” and playing the game gives me a certain kind of satisfaction when I feel like my efforts have effects.
It helps that the beans are adorable; I want to save them, and it makes me happy when I do. It’s the kind of short-term pleasure derived from playing a game that then seeps into the slight joy I feel when I hear “Dumb Ways to Die.” 
My reaction to the song is one of nostalgia and also just something that detracts from my anxiety. Before a presentation or before I click on the assignment to view my grade, sometimes I sing “Dumb Ways to Die” to myself so I can relax and remind myself that life is precious and much more than the negativity that can infiltrate it. 
“Dumb Ways to Die” is important to me because it reminds me of the summer after sixth grade when practically everyone at camp would sing it. It also reaffirms how animation as a medium is immensely helpful for me in understanding and coping with my own anxiety. 
Other animated videos, such as Hannah Grace’s short “Overcomer” and the BBC’s “Incredible animation on battling and overcoming anxiety,” are also impactful in the ways they visualize anxiety. “Overcomer” is relatable, particularly when animated text of negative thoughts move across the screen — much like my own internal negativity. The BBC’s animations echo that relatability in amplifying the physicality of worrying.
I resonate with such videos because whether they’re serious or lighthearted, they show that people out there share anxiety like mine and that someone out there might be in the same mental state as me. Whenever I’m struggling with a bad bout of anxiety, I turn to animation. For me, that’s the smart thing to do.
