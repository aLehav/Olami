USC opens its Pac-10 season Saturday at Washington State, not exactly the most anticipated of conference openers.
Still, USC coach Lane Kiffin said these are the kind of games coaches have to be most wary of, especially at USC.
Focused · Coach Lane Kiffin said that playing Washington State is the kind of game he worries about because it’s not on national television. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“I’ve always thought with coaching here, one of your hardest things to do is get your team motivated when it’s not the national game of the week,” Kiffin said.
USC is used to playing in front of a national television audience but has sometimes struggled against lesser opponents in games without much hype.
“These guys have been so programmed to be in so many of those [big] games that these are the games you worry about,” Kiffin said.
The Cougars are 1-2 this season, their sole win coming in a narrow 23-22 victory over Montana State. Still, despite their underwhelming résumé, Kiffin said there are a few Cougars playing good football.
Jeff Tuel leads Washington State at quarterback with an efficiency rating of 135.5 and running back James Montgomery has averaged 4.5 yards per carry.
“Their quarterback is playing a lot better than people would assume by maybe their record,” Kiffin said.
No matter who the Trojans are playing Saturday, one USC coach was clearly excited.
“All I know is it’s the Pac-10 opener,” defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin said. “First Pac-10 opener for me. I’m pretty doggone excited. I hope the team is.”

Kiffin has not revealed who will start at running back Saturday. Redshirt junior Marc Tyler has started every game this season, but senior Allen Bradford opened up the competition again after his 131 yards and 12 carries against Minnesota.
Tyler was limited at practice Wednesday, but Bradford wasn’t expecting any changes.
“I’m not anticipating on starting,” Bradford said. “I’m just … preparing as if I’m the No. 1 back. If it happens, it happens.”
Kiffin has been rotating Tyler, Bradford and freshman Dillon Baxter with the first team this week.
Tyler remains No. 1 on the depth chart, but Kiffin said Tuesday that Bradford’s performance made the competition a lot closer.
There was a question as to whether freshman cornerback Nickell Robey’s spot at corner was also in jeopardy.
The Trojans have freshman safety Patrick Hall, who was suspended by Kiffin for the first three games of the season and will be available for the first time against the Cougars. Kiffin also said freshman cornerback Demetrius Wright will get playing time regardless of the score.
But Kiffin maintained that the competition had not necessarily been reopened, and the coaches would continue to evaluate the position.
Robey was beat on a touchdown against Minnesota, but said he easily moved on from the play.
“You just gotta keep your head up and just have a short memory,” Robey said.
Kiffin said he was not concerned about Robey’s mind set.
“Nickell’s very confident right now,” he said.

Ball security was the major emphasis of practice and the stakes were high: Milkshakes were on the line.
On the final play of the 11-on-11 team portion of practice, senior quarterback Mitch Mustain’s pass was deflected, then intercepted by junior cornerback T.J. Bryant, causing the defense to erupt in excitement.
The deal was that if the defense created a turnover, secondary coach Willie Mack Garza had to buy milkshakes for them.
“It was good to see the defense keep fighting for the ball,” Kiffin said.
—
Along with Tyler, junior defensive tackle Armond Armstead and redshirt sophomore defensive end Nick Perry were limited Wednesday, as they have been for the last few weeks.
Redshirt senior linebacker Michael Morgan and junior tight end Blake Ayles were also limited.

It is already five weeks into school and many of USC’s athletic teams already boast winning streaks. Some are extending their streaks from last season, while others are beginning fresh.
Women’s volleyball and men’s waterpolo currently have the largest win streaks at USC. Both teams have successfully beaten 11 of their last opponents. The No. 6 Women of Troy beat UC Irvine 3-0 on Tuesday at their season opener and will face No. 11 UCLA on Friday at the Galen Center.
Katrina MacGregor | Daily Trojan
The No. 1 men’s waterpolo team upset No. 3 California and No. 2 UCLA en route to winning the NorCal Tournament last weekend. The 2009 NCAA champs are continuing their win streak from last season where they won the last three games of the season. The water polo team looks to continue its streak  Friday against Fresno Pacific at the Lancer Invitational.
The next highest streak belongs to the women’s soccer team, which boasts a seven-game unbeaten streak, all from this season. The Women of Troy’s last three games were all victories, with the most recent against Oklahoma, which bumped USC up from No. 25 in the rankings to its current standing of No. 22.
Although the men’s tennis team has not started its season yet, it carries a six-game winning streak from its championship run last season. Its first tournament of the year will be Friday, the Napa Challenge, and will extend through the weekend.
Not to be forgotten, the football team is also steadily building a win streak. The Trojans hold a four-game winning streak, dating back to their victory at the Emerald Bowl in January. This Saturday’s game against Washington State University will be played at Martin Stadium, with kickoff at noon.
These five teams have all shown considerable talent in maintaining their winning streaks. Time will tell how long each lasts.

Whether you are a senior feeling the pressure to find a job after graduation or a freshman with plenty of leg room to decide on a career, your résumé belongs online.
“Many companies and recruiters are now reducing their traditional classified and job-board advertising because they are buried in applications from poorly qualified candidates and are increasingly searching for people who better fit their criteria on the Internet and social networks,” Dan Finnigan, CEO of Jobvite, wrote for “Hire Education,” an online blog on The Wall Street Journal.
Today the unemployment rate is 10 percent for workers between 20 and 25 years old. Having an online profile or résumé webpage can only increase ones chances of standing out and being hired.
Recruiters receive dozens of applications from college grads, and most applicants’ qualifications don’t vary much since all have little prior work experience, if any. Typing an applicant’s name into Google is a given, so wow them with the search results. An online profile will set you apart because it isn’t the status quo — yet.
An online résumé better serves an applicant’s purpose. It can’t be lost or thrown away. It doesn’t have to be printed out because it is designed to be read on a computer screen. It has unlimited space for content, even though the best profiles are kept minimal. Most importantly, it can be updated instantly.
You don’t have to take a class or hire someone to make your online profile. Creating a functional website is not as hard as it seems, but for those daunted by HTML, there are plenty of blogging websites, such as wordpress.com, that will allow you to customize your online profile. It is ideal if you make it yourself, as it is a reflection of your work.
An online résumé lets you showcase all of your work, unlike a one-page paper résumé. Entire sections can be dedicated to the experience you’ve had so that your interests and strengths are fully detailed. The addition of those accomplishments will impress recruiters, and you will appear multifunctional and a potential part of a diverse company.
An online profile also allows you to show recruiters your strengths in addition to telling them. Include links to websites, articles and blogs, and upload actual samples of your hard work. Then give a brief, yet compelling explanation of each feature of your profile. Companies are looking to see that you not only have goals but a record of achieving them.
Once your online profile is completed, get it out there. Include a link to your profile on your Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn but also take advantage of how companies and businesses use social media to market themselves by networking — follow their tweets and Facebook pages.
Be an interactive member of social media society. Respond, post, tweet, like and update as much as possible because though it might seem silly, it will catch people’s eye — people that might want to hire you someday. Businesses want fans and having job applicants as fans is impressive. It shows you have interest and knowledge about the company because you are actively in tune with it.
“In this new emerging era, you need to manage your online profiles like companies do their websites. Expect anyone to find them to learn more about you and your potential,” Finnigan said.
With that in mind, make sure everything about you online reflects you in an appropriate light. You never know what employer is searching for you.

Eight years: That’s how long it took The 88 to finally get around to dropping the obligatory eponymous release that seems to be a requirement of every upstart band. Eight years of crisscrossing the country, and the band has done a handful of international performances; but for every show it’s done abroad, it’s probably done 10 in California since the Los Angeles-based band’s formation in 2002.

But The 88 isn’t an upstart band. What’s the logic in releasing a self-titled album if not to contribute to an unestablished group’s name recognition? Why would The 88 release The 88 after already being named L.A. Weekly’s “Best Pop/Rock Band of the Year,” having its songs featured on The OC, and opening for the likes of The Flaming Lips, Smashing Pumpkins, Rilo Kiley and Matt Costa?
With any other group, an eponymous release this far into a band’s career would probably represent an effort to go back to the basics, to recapture the essence of its early sound when it was toiling away in anonymity for the sheer love of music.
That doesn’t seem to be the case with The 88. The group’s music is almost defined by its consistency from one album to the next as it’s not always possible to immediately distinguish old from new material. With a sound that remains almost completely unchanged since the band’s formation nearly a decade ago, titling a fifth full-length album something that evokes a freshman release just doesn’t seem all that necessary.
That said, The 88 — Adam Merrin (piano), Keith Slettedahl (guitar and vocals), Todd O’Keefe (bass) and Anthony Zimmitti (drums) — can’t very well be faulted for its reluctance to mess with a winning formula. At worst, The 88’s innocuous brand of soft rock is still blandly pleasant and eminently marketable — the reason the band’s songs are so often incorporated into film and television soundtracks has to be how easily they’re snatched up for on-screen action.
In any case, the band has cultivated a sizeable following in the Southern California indie music scene due in no small part to the band’s high visibility in major networks’ primetime slots (recently songs have been featured on The Hills, Gossip Girl and How I Met Your Mother).
Coming in at 11 tracks, The 88 is slightly shorter than a typical release from The 88. In an unorthodox move from the My Rocket Science label, the album was made available exclusively on iTunes on Sept. 14 with the intention of distributing it as a wide release two weeks later.
The opening track, “Center of the Sun,” was announced as the album’s first single in late August and, perhaps better than any other lead-off song, sets the tone for every song to follow. Slettedahl’s distinctive vocals and guitar are almost guaranteed to be the first and second most important parts of any song by The 88 you care to name and “Center of the Sun” is no different.
It’s an understatement to say only that the song features his contributions prominently; in truth, it wouldn’t be a song without them. In much the same way that Queen is nothing without Freddie Mercury’s incomparable vocal acrobatics — don’t get me started on that blasphemous “Queen + Paul Rogers” nonsense — it’s impossible to imagine The 88 without Slettedahl’s devil-may-care voice work.
Track two, “They Ought To See You Now,” has already been selected as the second single. The song’s hook is positively infectious, and it escapes the damning designations of “forgettable” and “easily-mixed-uppable” that can reasonably be applied to a vast majority of The 88’s work.
The best thing about the selection of “They Ought To See You Now” as the second single is that it suggests that the only factor in the label’s single-selection process is sequence in the album’s tracklisting. The pattern thus far is encouraging since track three, “After Hours,” will be named the third single. It’s the far-and-away strongest song on the album, rich in the nostalgia and sentimentality that characterizes The 88 at its best.
As a whole, however, The 88 can’t be said to characterize the band at its best: Like every other album the group has put out, it’s business as usual for the Los Angeles rockers. But as fans well know, business-as-usual for The 88 is better-than-average for most.

You no longer have to chant, “rain rain go away,” because with rain comes must-have fall accessories to keep up the cool California-style during times of mild temperatures, scattered rain and gloom.
“There are so many ways to be creative, warm and chic at the same time,” said Jasmine Saei, an undeclared sophomore.
To kick off this cooling season, invest in a beanie by Rag & Bone, Eugenia Kim or Free People to keep your luscious locks warm and tidy. Eugenia Kim has a wide selection of knit caps, the most popular ones being the Jill Slouchy Knit Cap and the Woomi Earflap Cap.
The Jill Slouchy Knit Cap is a cable-knit alpaca hat that comes in a dark grey and various other colors, perfectly appropriate for gloomy skies and a white fitted v-neck long-sleeved shirt.
The Woomi earflap cap is 100 percent wool and the ties on the sides of the hat are braided and end with pompoms. The hat comes in brown and white, both of which would look great with a pea coat and boots.
Although these caps are somewhat pricey at about $180, they are made with high-quality material and complement many upcoming fall fashions.
Instead of the traditional pashmina scarf that’s all fashion and no warmth, tubular scarves are a win-win choice. They keep your neck warm and cozy covered in layers and layers of fabric.
For a sophisticated look, check out Alice + Olivia’s Dip Dye Tubular Scarf or their grey sweater-type scarf. These two scarves can be converted into regular or tubular scarves depending on which fits better with your outfit. Both of these scarves are between $156 and $176, but the warmth they provide is worth the money spent. Or, to get more bang for your buck, H&M has a great scarf selection with prices as low as $14.95.
“I especially like scarves because they are not only useful and practical, like keeping you warm, but can also style an outfit and add color or pattern,” said Sarah Ramanuj, a sophomore majoring in English.
Anything below 60 degrees in Southern California will likely keep you curled up by the heater dreading your trek to class. Keep your face warm and put your ear muffs on. Although designer Eugenia Kim has some stylish ear muffs, you might want a milder look. Urban Outfitters’ has a great oversized flower earwarmer for just $28.
The earwarmer is knitted grey with a pop-out red rose surrounded by yellow leaves for a very chic and charming finishing touch to your outfit. It can double as both an earwarmer and a headband so a bad hair day can be hidden while your ears warm up.
Another item of interest is Urban Outfitters’ Wooden Ships Isadora turban, which comes in both gold and black knit and has an intertwined detail in the front. Urban Outfitters has a wide variety of other earwarmers, hats,and fedoras ranging from as low as $20 to $48.
Looking fresh for the winter doesn’t end with your clothes; it extends to other accessories, including umbrellas. Urban Outfitters, a great option for trendy umbrellas, has prices ranging from as low as $18 to $48. Its most popular umbrellas are clear bubble dome umbrellas with different colored trims.
Don’t let some measly raindrops stop you; throw on a raincoat, hike up your rain boots, pick up your new umbrella and hit the streets of Los Angeles.
Don’t forget about your hands — they need attention and warmth too. Shopbop.com has a wide variety of gloves, fingerless gloves, mittens and arm warmers to match any style. Bop Basics has Thick Knit Flip Top Mittens for $58 in many different colors and Cashmere Fingerless gloves for $65 in black and dark heather grey. This website has every designer, cheap and pricey, to aid your glove search.
Forever 21 also has an ample selection of leggings, stockings and tights that are patterned, embroidered and come in all different styles and forms. From black lace tights for $6.80 to opaque high knee socks for $3.80, you will get great prices and add an edge to your outfit.
For inspiring ideas of how to turn a boring winter outfit into a wintertime masterpiece, check out LOOKBOOK’s section on lfstores.com. Lf is a popular Southern California store known for its trendy picks and occasional sales. On its website, the store has pictures of many different outfits and ideas for looks that fashionistas can put together.

For Southern Californians, the arrival of autumn is marked by a temperature shift five degrees downward, a slight increase in cloud cover and the occasional smattering of drizzle. What to wear, then, as classes start up and the (mild) heat dies down?
The latter months of 2010 are all about taking those lightweight summer garments and embracing their versatility by layering them with bolder autumn threads. When midterm season goes into full swing, check out these items in the event of an urgent retail therapy session.
For the ladies
Dresses aren’t just for sunny summer days outdoors — consider the dress an item open to creative manipulation. Pair that favorite floral sundress with a jacket and boots or a gauzy shift with tights and heels. If the summer fabrics are a little too worn, consider a piece inspired by the change in seasons.
On the pre-fall 2010 runways, designers presented varied concepts of the dress: from Chanel’s bold prints and strong shape to Vera Wang’s structured slouch, the savvy shopper should embrace the possibility of feminine autumn apparel.
For an idea of this season’s variety, look no further than Anthropologie’s fall releases: its Braque Bodice Dress crosses a busy pattern with a fitted bodice and is the perfect twist of flowy summer silhouettes and an autumn-appropriate structure. At $158, the dress is costly but sets an example for other dress styles from various retailers.
Slide them on
Denim has taken a turn for the slimmer. Skinnies are everywhere. Jeggings (the newborn jean-and-stretch-legging hybrid) are also everywhere. No matter the jean, this season they will be fitted from the hip to the ankle. For a more traditional color, find your match in the Paige Skyline Skinny, which features a dark wash and a fitted straight leg.
Looking for a more playful denim muse? Try Modcloth’s Meet Me at the Mulberry Jeans — a mulberry-and-white jean with cream-colored stitching ($64.99) sure to tickle any color-lover’s fancy.
Top it off
For those not-so-frigid fall mornings in Southern California, outerwear not only provides a barrier between SoCal skin and mild winds, but instantly transitions a piece between seasons.
Trends to watch for this fall?  The military-inspired motorcycle jacket, much like the Lucinda jacket by Guess ($108), adds both warmth and edge to summer’s floral and lace tops or skirts.
And when an outfit needs instant polish, the go-to fix is a fitted blazer; for a more casual, I’m-always-this-effortlessly-fantastic vibe, opt for a looser fit. J. Crew’s Solid Thandie ($148) and Norwood blazers ($248) showcase both the businesslike and relaxed personalities of this versatile piece.
A sharp-dressed man
Much respect should be given to the men who know that a jacket can go with everything and should endure (just about) anything. Trendy types should check out pieces like the D Collection New Gilligan Jacket ($168) from Urban Outfitters. A blend of the traditional pea oat with the military-inspired structures of the season, styles like this are a must-try experiment for the bold.
Fellows on the more casual side might want to look into cozier autumn trends, like the plaid Yellowstone CPO Jacket ($79.50) from Levi’s, which gives the lumberjack pattern a twist with a tweed-like fabric.
Take note — Plaid works as a jacket and a shirt pattern and has passed into an androgynous zone, making it one of the most favored fall styles of men and women alike.
Fits just right
Denim is easy to wear every day, yet it’s much harder to find the perfect pair, with the ubiquitous nature of jeans making the act of choosing a pair seem daunting. LADD Denim keeps it simple: the Los-Angeles based brand focuses on just three styles of jeans this autumn.
Labeled as the Spring 2011 collection, LADD centers around the Jermaine lean fit, the T-Man loose fit and the Blake skinny fit — these three styles will be sure to satisfy most fashion palates.

USC needs eco-initiative
When it comes to energy legislation, USC is a microcosm of the United States government. The administration spends money on programs, develop networks and associations, as we seemingly promote “sustainable behavior.”
It’s time we stop flirting with commitment and take the plunge. I came to USC for its excellence in academics, athletics and philanthropy. I was thrilled to discover USC’s new Green Technologies program in the Viterbi School of Engineering; however, I felt less than thrilled, filled with confusion and mildly betrayed when I left the Tuesday’s “Beyond Coal” student initiative meeting because I discovered that USC meets 40 percent of its electricity needs with coal.
The Massey Energy disaster earlier this year resulting in the deaths of Virginian coal miners and miners currently trapped in Chile are only two visible examples of the horrors of coal production. Most of its negative implications, however, go unseen, felt only in our lungs and by our atmosphere.
Students across the country are pushing their campuses to join the quest for renewable energy use. USC is absolutely talking the talk: the Green Technologies program, the Energy Institute and the Student Energy Network are a few of many efforts being made around campus, but removing our dependence on coal seems like an obvious step to take if we hope to make any claims at being green.
Viterbi is ranked 10th and USC 24th, according to U.S. News & World Reports. Someone please then tell me why with our resources and reputation we didn’t even make the Sierra Clubs recent “Top 100 Green Schools” rankings?
Considering Los Angeles has the worst air pollution of any city in the world, it seems too obvious for us to want to strive for cleaner sources of energy to accommodate the vast number of cars on our highways.
Let us take the stage, pledge our commitment to cleaner air and represent Los Angeles and this university as the rapidly evolving and entities and leaders that they are, rather than continuing on our usual path, similar to the path of the U.S. government, sitting back and watching the world pass us by.

Student cyclists deserve more respect
One of my students brought to my attention the article in Sept. 21 issue, “Student group hopes to keep bikes on campus.” I think USC has a beautiful campus — my husband and three children are alumni, and prior to my working on campus, I had been “hanging around” since 1970. I recently re-watched my husband’s graduation ceremony in the ’60s and I noticed the remarkable changes in landscaping and pedestrian areas. However, what makes a university is people, and specifically students. Bikes are a necessity for them, especially those who live blocks away from campus.
I was recently frustrated when I could not sit on a bench because a bike was cabled and locked to the bench. But I just went somewhere else to sit. I didn’t let it ruin my day. Unlike “alumni” and “donors,” I am on campus five days a week during critical mass times, and bikes are just a fact of campus life. I am sure those same “alumni” and “donors” had the use of bikes when they were students. Would they prefer a campus empty of bikes/people to achieve aesthetics?
There is a dearth of parking for bikes, especially around the campus center in the middle of the day, but it isn’t the students’ fault. It was very poor planning on the part of the people who designed the new campus center based solely on esthetics. In minimizing function, they did not take into consideration that bikes are the mode of transportation on campus, and that  is their fault, not the students. Ergo, USC should do everything in its power to address the lack of spaces to park bikes.
When higher powered alumni and donors come to campus, ask them to park on 28th Street and walk to campus carrying 40 pounds of books, then see how they feel about using a bike. USC should consider taking one of those parking lots and making it a bike parking lot. We are fortunate to have these students attend USC. Please treat them as future alumni.

I agree with Ariel on the need for cleaner energy. Even backwards countries like Iran and North Korea have nuclear power plants… so why don’t we? If USC would build a nuclear reactor, it’d be a great resource for our engineering students to develop the energy technology of the future, as well as powering the campus and the surrounding community.

A USC alumnus recently said, “You’re making all this money off these kids and you’re giving them crumbs.” But this wasn’t just any alumnus — it was former Trojan football sensation Reggie Bush.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Perhaps if Bush, who at the time was on a full scholarship, knew what many students and families go through just to pay tuition at USC, he would have embraced a different perspective.
The caliber of USC undergraduates has certainly risen over the years. Thus, the university must collaborate to meet the financial needs of all students, whether it’s based on test-taking skills, a certain income bracket, ethnicity, family ties or just being a hardworking Trojan.
In the early 1990s, when many of this year’s entering freshman were just coming into the world, USC was largely viewed as a party school for rich Southern Californian young adults.
The university’s reputation was mediocre. According to former president Steven B. Sample in The Contrarian’s Guide to Leadership, “Things had become so desperate that the university was accepting applications for admission to the fall semester as late as one week into the semester itself … graduation rates were abysmally low.”
Times have changed. Although USC’s image as a party school might persist on the outside, the facts are now on our side.
Not only was USC’s admission rate for the incoming class of 2010 a university-low 24 percent, but USC has expanded its outreach across the globe. A little more than half of this year’s freshman class is from California, and 11 percent of newly admitted students represent 48 different countries.
USC is clearly on the move in higher student selectivity, national rankings and global prestige. We can bet that those statistics will only continue rise. What’s holding the university back from realizing even greater progress now is the cost.
USC’s price tag is a heavy, almost unreachable expense for most families without outside assistance, which is why USC is particularly supportive in awarding university funds — whether in the form of financial aid or scholarships — to undergraduates.
Need-based grants are awarded to students in a certain financial bracket. Prestigious scholarships, sometimes up to full tuition, are awarded based on high school test scores. And other scholarships honor students of a particular geographical background.
Make no mistake, these scholarships play a crucial role. More often than not they are the deciding factor between attending USC and enrolling in a less costly institution elsewhere.
But as helpful as these awards are, they still leave a portion of USC students — who don’t completely satisfy the requirements of either of these groups — wondering what they can do to cut down their tuition cost if they don’t want to be burdened with hefty loans in the future.
Supportive families will often fund their student’s education, but it could still leave many students looking for a way to do their part — to chip away at tuition costs while advancing their academic and professional careers.
The bottom line: It’s time for the university to establish new and innovative scholarships available to all undergraduate students.
We are already on the right track. Each professional school at USC has a series of scholarships based on certain majors.
Still, it isn’t enough to list these opportunities on a website when such a large investment in a student’s college education is at stake.
Scholarship fairs, where students have the opportunity to meet and interact with representatives of numerous scholarship programs, would be another step in the right direction.
Another obstacle is that students and their families don’t exactly know the specifics of where their tuition goes in the first place. Given the continued rise in tuition, perhaps it is fair during these times to request a series of easily accessible  transparent documents outlining where USC tuition dollars are allocated throughout the university.
USC will most likely always be in a position to adjust its financial budget according to student needs. USC is not only a private university free from political obligations, but it also has the largest university-funded financial aid budget of any university in the country — more than $180 million each year of university funds goes to undergraduates, according to USC News.
Whether through scholarships or other forms of financial aid, USC must find new ways to meet all students and their families in the middle on affordability at a premiere institution.
After all, investing in a student’s education only increases his or her chances of investing back into the university — what goes around comes around.
Stephen Zelezny is a sophomore majoring in public relations. His column, “USC on the Move,” runs Thursdays.
“You’re making all this money off these kids and you’re giving them crumbs.” <–this fallacious argument is called an 'appeal to authority. Wow! I'm sure Reggie was totally engaged in the academics here. It doesn't matter because he's making millions in the NFL, so a formal education < pro sports paycheck right?
"In the early 1990s, when many of this year’s entering freshman were just coming into the world, USC was largely viewed as a party school for rich Southern Californian young adult" along with the 70% admit rate then, pretty pathetic I'd say. 
SC is a great school now…buuuuut, have some of you parents who commented; read this article; or wanted to send your children here but couldn't because of the pricey tuition thought that maybe a public school with much lower tuition would be just as good? An undergrad education is a generic experience nowadays. Sure SC's got its unique football fervor; Greek life is pretty intense; the academics are great here; and so forth. But you can experience this at public schools too. That one across town, in Westwood, is still slightly harder than SC to gain admission to because of its much lower tuition and the fact that a huge unprecedented number of applicants applied more than prior years. Think about it, for an undergrad degree, if you're pursuing a liberal arts degree, the prestige of the school doesn't matter. It only matters if you're pursuing a professional degree such as med school or law. 
Please don't erase my comment. Let the truth be told.
I have one complaint about need based scholarships. I know of many circumstances where one parent “purposely” does not work to lower the family total income. Therefore, the student becomes eligible for scholarship and grants. They say why work when “jr” can get  a free ride to attend school.  My husband and I are like many families, not poor enough to get financial aid, but not rich enough to just write a check for our daughter’s tuition. I feel that if a parent is physically able, they should be required to repay some of the scholarship/loan in the form of  labor back to the school. Have them serve at the food locations or pick up trash after football games. Have them repay for receiving a first class education free of charge to their child.
Interesting article.
 One question I have, that you could possibly address in an a future investigative piece, is about winning scholarships and how that effects the grants and loans. From what I understand of the USC policy, If a student has a grant, then wins a scholarship, that scholarship money gets paid back to the school by being subtracted from the student’s grant. 
At other schools, I hear that the money won from a scholarship goes to paying off student loans, and the student gets to keep their grant money. This type of policy is more beneficial to students and seems to encourage students to get scholarships, where the USC policy seems to discourage it. There was a big scandal with the USC Financial Aid Department a few years ago (The head of that department was getting kickbacks from financial institutions), So it  may be interesting to see if the current USC policy was ever reviewed and if it was not corrected after that incident. Such an investigation could possibly find and correct a policy that effects many USC students. 
You could interview students with loans and scholarships, staff from the Financial aid departments at USC and other universities about policy, and consult books and their authors about student financial strategies. (like author of How to go to College for Almost Free)
You could also look into why some grants don’t cover lab fees, books, food or rent, why they don’t and why some do. 
Okay, I don’t know if you guys are into doing a story on such things, but I know I would be interested in reading it. 
Keep up the good work!

There has been a significant rise in college students searching for internships as a way to secure a stable job after graduation, according to a study by The Wall Street Journal. University officials say this trend has been seen in USC students as well.
Students at USC have been seeking out more internships, said Angie Sabido-Wood, director of employer relations and research at the USC Career Planning and Placement Center.
On the clock · Venessa Matio, a senior majoring in business administration, talks about her résumé with Lee Dresser from the career center. - Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan
“In the last eight or so years, the number of students on campus who have been looking for internships has definitely been increasing,” Sabido-Wood said.
She explained that more students are realizing the connection between internships and the job prospects out of college.
“Students are becoming more savvy about how to get a job after graduation, and they understand the value of working at an internship. At USC, we’re seeing not just upperclassmen, but even freshmen looking for internship opportunities,” Sabido-Wood said.
In a study released by The Wall Street Journal, a quarter of the college recruiters polled said that more than half of their company’s recently graduated employees had previously interned for the company.
“The company can get a very valuable read at how good an intern could be as a potential employee there. It allows them to assess the intern with a ‘try before you buy’ mentality, and then hiring them full-time becomes a natural extension of that,” said Alec Levenson, a research scientist with the Center for Effective Organizations at the USC Marshall School of Business.
Part of this is related to the current trend of companies converting current interns into full-time employees after they have earned their bachelor’s degree, he said.
The trend of in-house hiring as a means of job recruiting has become especially relevant in today’s sluggish economy, as more applicants are using internship experience as a bridge to find a steady or well-paying job.
“With the recession going on right now, the supply and demand factor comes into play. Because there are fewer regular jobs available, the option of an internship becomes more important because it gives the person an opportunity to get their foot in the door and keep working in the field of their choice,” Levenson said.
A recent survey in the National Association of College and Employers Job Outlook 2011 Fall Preview showed that the Western region of the United States will see the biggest rise in hiring for college graduates in the next year, with a 23.5 percent increase from 2010.
Many students on campus have used their internship experience as a way to enhance their résumé and gain real world experience related to their major.
“Experience is so important these days because competition is so high. Kids are doing everything in the world right now, and if you want to remain a competitive applicant for graduate school or for a job, you really have to be able to show that you have experience in your field,” said Ana Emamian, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention.
Emamian interned as a student researcher at the Perinatology Research Branch for the National Institutes of Health in Detroit for two months this summer.
Students can explore their internship options at the career center, located in the Student Union. The center’s resources include the connectSC job website and e-mail updates from the Internship Programs Office.
The career center holds an Internship Week during the fall and spring semesters, conducts mock interviews and reviews résumés for students throughout the year.
“USC students understand the values of internships and take advantage of them as much as possible.” Sabido-Wood said. “They’re going out there and getting that experience that will lead them to their job of choice after graduation.”

In a state appeals court Monday, a California judge issued a decision to resume the practice of capital punishment in the state.
In 2006, because of widespread concern about potential wrongful convictions and unfair application of the death penalty, the state Assembly’s Public Safety Committee passed legislation that placed a moratorium on executions.
A commission was delegated the task of conducting a study to determine the most effective ways of preventing wrongful convictions and recommending solutions to the state Legislature by 2008, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.
Monday’s decision effectively removed one of the last-remaining obstacles that stood in the way of reinstating executions in California, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Now, on Sept. 29, the state is set to execute Albert Greenwood Brown, who was convicted 30 years ago for the rape and murder of a 15-year-old girl.
Opponents of this reversal in policy claim that execution still remains too dangerous and risky of an action for the state to engage in.
“There are still too many questions about the serious flaws in [the] system to proceed with the execution of any prisoner,” Lance Lindsey, head of the non-profit organization Death Penalty Focus, told the French news agency Agence France-Presse. “The state is moving too hastily with reckless regard for the law.”
Additionally, many lawyers for death row inmates at San Quentin State Prison are seeking to extend the 2006 moratorium until procedures are improved, according to the Associated Press.
It remains unclear whether further judicial action will delay Monday’s decision from materializing. A federal judge could still overturn the decision.

There’s no doubt that the Garden State has been dominating the cable airwaves recently — just look at Bravo’s The Real Housewives of New Jersey, MTV’s Jersey Shore, the Style Network’s Jerseylicious and Oxygen’s Jersey Couture.
Sure, these programs have been, for the most part, successful and done wonderful things for the pockets of their creators, producers and talent (I use the term loosely).  But these shows have done little for New Jersey’s reputation as a state of any legitimacy.
That is until HBO’s Boardwalk Empire came along.  The new gangster crime drama is set in Atlantic City, New Jersey during the 1920s and features Steve Buscemi playing Enoch “Nucky” Thompson, based on real-life mobster Enoch L. Johnson.
Never has the term “premium cable” seemed so fitting with Sopranos writer Terence Winter and Academy Award-winning director Martin Scorsese on board.
On Sept. 21, after Sunday’s pilot episode aired to an averaged 4.8 million viewers, HBO announced that they will be picking up the Prohibition-era drama for a second season.

The DREAM act died on the Senate floor today, aided by a Republican-led filibuster and a 56-43 vote, short of the 60 supermajority needed to block it.
The Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act would have allowed children of illegal immigrants older than 16 who lived in the United States for at least five years and had a good record to attend college or join the military.
The act was tacked onto the National Defense Authorization act, which usually passes with bipartisan support, and would also repeal the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy this year.
Senate Majority leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) has been criticized for not pushing the bill through earlier, when the Democrats had a supermajority.
Reid accused Republicans of stalling in an effort to undermine the repeal of DADT and the Dream act.
Although further effort to repeal DADT through the judicial system has been effective, efforts for immigration reform have not advanced as far.

On Tuesday, a suspicious envelope was found inside the Hedco Neuroscience building on campus, setting off a flurry of concern that resulted in a swarm of DPS and LAPD presence around the perimeter of the building, including a bomb squad.
In the end, it was revealed that the envelope just contained a magazine and LED device.
However, for about two tense Jack Bauer-esque hours, there was the very real possibility that the situation at hand could have had a much less fortunate result.
As the events were unfolding, there seemed to be two distinct groups on campus: those who were aware of the impending crisis, through word of mouth or DPS’ TrojansAlert system, and those who had no idea that there was a potential scare on campus.
In light of yesterday’s events, we want to know:
How satisfied are you with the methods of emergency communication on campus?

Very happy with the alerts. I got three, but better safe than sorry.
Satisfied enough: if students don’t sign up for Trojan Alert, what else can USC do? If students are in class and the professor gets an alert, then I think that professor should mention it to the class.

USC Trojans wide receiver Markeith Ambles will not be able to redshirt during the 2010 season, head coach Lane Kiffin said Tuesday. Ambles has participated in three plays this season, all against Hawaii in the season opener, disqualifying him from attaining redshirt status. Ambles had no receptions and a dropped pass in the 49-36 Trojans victory over the Rainbow Warriors.
Kiffin had attempted to secure redshirt status for Ambles despite the playing time. Typically, NCAA rules prohibit a player who has participated in a game from redshirting unless they suffer a season-ending injury sometime during the first four games of the year.
The receiver did not travel with the team to Minnesota, as Kiffin believed at the time that redshirting was not out of the equation.
Ambles was ranked among the top wide receivers in the class of 2010 out of Henry County High School in McDonough, Georgia. The 6-2, 185 pound Ambles also considered the University of North Carolina, Louisiana State, Tennessee, and Auburn before ultimately committing to USC. Ambles is expected to join freshman Robert Woods and redshirt Kyle Prater in a trio of deadly receivers in USC’s 2010 recruiting class.
Ambles’ situation recalls that of USC fullback Ryan Powdrell in 2004, who participated in one play, a kickoff return, during a game against Virginia Tech. Powdrell was forced to sit out a couple games, but was still eventually granted redshirt status.

Authorities determined that a suspicious envelope  found in the Hedco Neuroscience Building mailroom was not a threat after the area was evacuated for about an hour Tuesday afternoon.
The suspicious package was a brown oversized envelope that contained a magazine with an LED device inside, according to Department of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle.
Junk mail · The Los Angeles Police Department and the USC Department of Public Safety responded to a report of a suspicious envelope in the Hedco Neuroscience Building Tuesday afternoon. The envelope turned out to be a magazine with an LED light inside. - Nathaniel Gonzales | Daily Trojan
At about 1:15 p.m. the person who discovered the package called DPS, Carlisle said.
DPS and the Los Angeles Police Department bomb squad arrived on the scene and evacuated the building and the surrounding area. Sections of Downey and Watt ways were closed off during the evacuation.
“Out of excess caution, DPS closed the building and called LAPD,” James Grant, assistant vice president for media relations, said.
LAPD scanned the package and declared it safe. Hedco and the surrounding area was reopened at about 2:45 p.m.
“It all turned out well, except for a disruption of classes,” Carlisle said.
DPS sent out Trojan Alerts to the USC community during the incident. The alerts warned students, faculty and staff to stay away from the affected area.
A similar incident occurred in May, when a bomb threat was called into Leavey Library. That call was later deemed a hoax.
Kate Mather and Chloe Stepney contributed to this report.
The first rule of bureaucracy: self-preservation. Always justify your job. The Department of Homeland Security now employs 230,000 people. Link here: newsweek.com/2010/09/04/zakaria-why-america-overreacted-to-9-11.html
Hop over to Google news and type in ‘supicious package’ or ‘bomb threat’ and see how widespread all these false incidents truly are. Either the populace is shocked to the core with paranoia about ‘envelopes’ and cardboard boxes and the terrorists have won, or it’s something more. See below.
It was proven under the Bush administration that Homeland Security was stoking the fears of terrorism for political gain. This administration proves once again it is no different than the last in yet another way. Tom Ridge, former director of Homeland Security, admitted as much: crooksandliars.com/john-amato/tom-ridge-admits-terror-alerts-were-use
Great article. A lot of students where waiting to find out what happened and you delivered the goods, Thanks!
Hey, Tired of DHS, stop the paranoia.  This was no drill, and USC is not inclined to want this type of media attention.  There was no fearmongering here, just concern for your safety.  What had to be done was done, everything turned out to be okay, and no one is afraid but you.
More likely than not someone had a midterm they didn’t want to take imo.
That’s a pretty serious accusation. Nothing wrong with taking extra caution.
Can we please stop with these stupid drills? We know that USC accepts money from Homeland Security. In turn, we allow them to run drills on campus. Check it out for yourself: create.usc.edu
You’re perpetuating a fear of terror amongst the students and faculty, and for what, a few extra federal dollars? Fearmongering is so below the Trojan family.

Although the Ronald Tutor Campus Center has been the center of attention for USC’s dining options this year, the recently renovated Café 84 hasn’t seen a decline in traffic.
Good eats · The Café 84 dining hall has still met all its projected revenue numbers and is still getting customers despite the opening of the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center food court, USC Hospitality said. - Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan 
Director of USC Hospitality Kris Klinger said Café 84 has been meeting all of its projected numbers in terms of revenue and student traffic this year despite the appeal of the campus center.
“The new campus center is definitely drawing a large group of students, but we feel that this is a great option for students who live in the area or want something different,” Klinger said.
Last winter, Café 84 went through several changes in anticipation of the closing of The Lot, the temporary food court built behind Grace Ford Salvatori Hall, and the opening of the campus center. The Grill was removed to create more space for the addition of Daphne’s Greek Café and Wasabi Sushi, a move aimed at making Café 84 a stronger food court overall, Klinger said.
Over the summer, Wahoo’s Fish Tacos was moved to the new campus center and replaced by Baja Fresh in preparation for the start of the school year.
Klinger said these modifications and any possible future revisions are all aimed at giving students the dining options they would most want to see.
“We’re just trying to respond to what the students want with the changes,” Klinger said. “As for the future, we’re always accepting suggestions from students for new ideas.”
During peak lunch and dinner hours, Café 84 still has many students dining at the cafeteria  even with the large amount of students who go to the campus center.
Café 84 also offers breakfast options for students who want more than a coffee. The convenience store, Jamba Juice and Baja Fresh are open by 7 a.m. on weekdays.
“I normally stop off for a quick breakfast before my early classes and it’s never too busy,” said Molly Smith, a freshman majoring in communication. “I’m able to just get in and get out.”
Many students agreed that the campus center can become overwhelmingly crowded, especially during the lunchtime rush, and that Café 84 provides a less hectic alternative.
“I feel like the campus center is always crowded and so was The Lot,” said Alexa Hudnut, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering. “I miss things like Wolfgang Puck, Submarina and Red Mango, but there are still plenty of good options to choose from between the campus center and Café 84.”
Several students who frequent Café 84 said they appreciate its convenience, especially those who live in nearby Fluor and Webb towers.
“The campus center definitely has better selections, like Panda Express and CPK, but I go to Café 84 because it’s way more convenient,” Smith said.
With its proximity to the Lyon Center, some students also use Café 84 for a post-workout snack.
“It’s great having a place right there where I can grab a Jamba Juice or a burrito after a workout,” said Preston Smith, a freshman majoring in accounting. “Otherwise, I’d have to go all the way out to the campus center or [Trojan Grounds] if I didn’t want one of the dining commons.”
