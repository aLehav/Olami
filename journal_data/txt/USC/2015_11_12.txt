Unified · The Black Student Assembly hosts a rally in Hahn Plaza to stand in solidarity with the students at the University of Missouri Thursday afternoon. At the event, students shared their concerns on USC’s campus climate. – Sebastian Vega | Daily Trojan
Hundreds of students gathered in Hahn Plaza Thursday afternoon to rally against racial discrimination and stand in solidarity with the students of the University of Missouri and other campuses across the nation.
The rally followed a series of racially tense conflicts at the University of Missouri in which black students received death threats for speaking out against racism. Since then, the University of Missouri’s president resigned after students protested, one student went on a hunger strike and  the football team refused to play in upcoming games.
The Black Student Assembly hosted the rally. Though the event was announced on Facebook Wednesday evening, more than 700 people said they were attending on the social media site by the morning of the event.
The event’s Facebook page called for students to dress in all-black attire and come prepared to support the students of Missouri with chants such as “When student voices are under attack, what do we do? Stand up! Fight back!” and “Ain’t no power like the power of the students ’cause the power of the students don’t stop.”
Mykaila Williams, executive director of BSA, kicked off the rally by explaining the situation in Missouri.
“Now, the students of the University of Missouri are not alone in their efforts to fight for justice,” Williams said. “Yale University students are fighting against racism within their fraternities and racial discrimination on campus. Berkeley students are protesting after a message on KKK and lynching was left on a public computer … At USC, we hope that most of you are aware of the campus climate resolution, which is our own attempt to stimulate change around diversity issues on campus.”
Williams said the demonstration contributes to a country-wide message.
“We’re holding this rally today in conjunction with student activists around the country who are wearing black to stand in solidarity with black students at Missouri,” she said.
After her opening speech, Williams opened up the floor to anyone who wanted to share his or her experience with racism or had something to share on the issue.
Omete Anassi, a senior majoring in neuroscience, recited a poem he wrote about his feelings on the racism black students experience.
“The reason I did the poem was to show that there is positivity in what we’re doing and that there’s a solution, which is to listen to each other,” Anassi said. “That is why I ended my poem with, ‘OK, I’m listening,’ which is to say I’m not just going to shout up your front door and complain about my issues, but I’m going to sit down with you and hope to connect as humans.”
Richard Alives said the University’s expansions in the surrounding neighborhoods in University Park, which consist of a population predominantly made up of underprivileged minority groups, hinders those residents.
“USC is buying the homes of people of color who have worked hard to own the homes that they live in, that are now being taken over by student housing,” Alives said. “I am here because this institution will not accept that it gentrifies.”
Williams and other leaders from BSA had the gathered students read printouts of racist Yik Yak posts made at USC and Missouri, which some wore on their chests and backs.
One post said, “I love it when black girls do white girl things like shut the f*ck up and have real hair.”
The gathered students then posed for photos with handmade signs that spelled out “USC fights on 4 Mizzou” and “Racism lives @ Mizzou, Ithaca, Yale, USC. Everywhere.”
After the rally, the students headed to Bovard Auditorium to hand President C. L. Max Nikias a letter written by the BSA about the need for change at USC.
“The letter spoke about the campus climate resolution and to a lesser extent about our solidarity with Missouri,” Williams said. “Unfortunately, Nikias was not [at Bovard], and I’m not sure who the woman was that we met with, but she was part of [Guest Relations].”
That prompted a chant of “I’m not a guest, I’m a student” by the remaining attendees. After a few minutes of chanting, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry came out of his office to address the students.
“Right now is not appropriate for the provost to attempt to meet with 200 students,”  Carry said in response to demands for a meeting to discuss the recently passed resolution on campus climate. “The provost and I would be glad to meet with 10 or 15 representatives today or tomorrow or whenever you’d like to meet.”
Further negotiations with Carry resulted in a meeting being planned to address students’ concerns.
Earlier this week, the Undergraduate Student Government voted, 11-1, in favor of sending a proposal to the administration that would address diversity issues on campus.
The meeting students proposed allowed the resolution’s authors to talk to the administration on making sure the points in the resolution are soon addressed, and also let other students listen in on the conversation.
Moira Turner, director of Diversity Affairs for USG, said the resolution focuses on implementing potential solutions to campus climate concerns.
“The campus climate resolution tries to tackle a lot of things,” Turner said. “It tries to localize itself around discrimination on campus, which can manifest itself in a lot of different ways, whether in regards to racism, sexism, sexuality and ability. We’re demanding a vice president for diversity, equity and inclusion.”
Corliss Bennett-McBride, the director of the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, was impressed with the demonstration’s turnout but not surprised.
“What I like about USC students, especially my students, is [that] they are about action,” Bennett-McBride said. “When I walked up to the rally and saw around 500 students gathered, I noticed that there were students of all backgrounds. Everybody was there. Students turned out to show the students at Missouri that we support them and stand in solidarity with them through the terrible circumstances they’re going through right now.”
Bennett-McBride said she was overjoyed with the students’ actions.
“I just want my students to know that I am so proud of them for standing up for the students at Missouri,” said Bennett-McBride, tearing up as she spoke.
A meeting was ultimately held between the authors of the campus climate resolution, Provost Michael Quick and Carry in the United University Church at 4:30 p.m. on Thursday. Students were encouraged to attend.
Mizzou and Missouri are simply a mess because four national political agendas and these students should be smarter than they have been in dealing with the situation.  C’mon, a hunger strike because the school following the mandate of Obamacare to cut off health care (to a guy whose parents made $8million last year according to SEC filings)…pawns.  Follow the money and you’l find the truth.
I think it is probably a natural inclination for people who are in their late teens and early 20s to “fight the system” now that they are free from their parents’ rule and are just discovering their own autonomy.  The only problem is, these students are fighting for an agenda that has absolutely nothing to do with race and they don’t understand that they are being manipulated.  They are pawns in a fight between the left and right and race just happens to be an easy target.  Hello, we have a black president of the U.S., we have Asians and Latinos in Congress, and all of these groups are well represented in the professions.  Poverty and the “entitlement” programs are the real issue. The U.S. government has spent trillions of dollars on “programs” with little to show for it,  so we have to wonder if the government is the proper entity to solve it.  A national debt of $18 TRILLION DOLLARS and increasing taxes will have a much larger impact on your futures than “racial inequalities” ever will.
The students are being manipulated by anarchist groups promoting a different agenda than racial equality. What folks did to each other 200 years ago is irrelevant to us today. If you haven’t moved on from that then you are racist in and of itself. Why is theRe a Black or Latino or Asian student union? Why is there a Congressional Black Caucus? Why are these groups allowed to exist? That is the ultimate form of racism. You should be protesting the racist mantra those groups promote.

You would expect an artist with almost a half of a million YouTube views on her debut music video to have already quit school in pursuit of a music career. But Skylar Steinberg, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, studies while perfecting her musical chops.
“I like school, I like science, I like doing that stuff,” Steinberg, who is also known by her middle name and alias Skylar Renee, said. “But, it’s not my passion. It’s nice to be in an environment where I can do both: singing and science.”
Steinberg released her first single, “Good As Gone,” with Hazan Records on iTunes in late July. Her music video racked up over 400,000 views on YouTube. Meanwhile, she’s taking chemistry at USC and finding time to finish her album which will be released next year.
“Right now I’m in organic chemistry, and that class takes so much time,” Steinberg said. “But any second of the day I can spend singing or writing songs, I am. I’ll be studying, and I’ll come up with a song idea, and I’ll just go to the piano [to]do it.”
Steinberg, a Malibu native, found her passion for songwriting earlier than her love of science.
“I’ve been singing since I was a kid, just ever since I did karaoke once when I was 8,” Steinberg said. “Ever since then I’ve been singing in my free time. I was in choir, and I wrote lyrics. Every once and I while I would just come up with an idea and write it down.”
Though she was in choir in high school, she has had less institutional involvement in music at USC. Steinberg only recently declared her songwriting minor, and for the most part, she separates her life at school from her life in music.
“I feel like a lot of my life at USC does not have to do with singing just because I kind of ignored it in the first few years here,” she said. “I’m growing as a musician now and meeting more people through music.”
Steinberg works with a producer in Studio City and has also begun songwriting classes, which have helped her get feedback from music students at USC.
“It’s hard to find time to write songs and play during the school year,” Steinberg said. “I started taking a songwriting class which helped me make a scheduled time to write songs, show them to other people and get feedback.”
Steinberg said she jams with a band in her free time, which helps connect her social life to her music life. Originally, she said, it was hard as a spring admit to originally connect the two.
“We’ll just chill and play, and I’ll just sing a random tune,” Steinberg said. “It’s fun to be in an environment with friends, doing what you love to do.”
Tunes like those come to Steinberg throughout the day, and because of her busy schedule, she grabs them on the go. She says her songwriting process is somewhat randomized.
“I’m inspired by a lot of things. I’m inspired by my own experiences and people and life and the world around me,” Steinberg said. “Sometimes I’ll go on walks and a song idea will come to me. I take in my surroundings mostly. I could be doing any activity and a song will come to me, and I’ll grab a quick voice memo.”
Steinberg is hoping to finish her album by next summer so she can play shows in Los Angeles or elsewhere. Right now, she’s just excited for the future.
“I don’t like planning too much in advance,” Steinberg said. “You never know what’s going to happen. Right now I’m focusing on the music.”

The Oxford comma is one of the many paradoxes of the English language. We were taught to put a comma before “and” in a list of three or more ideas, and since then, we have unquestioningly followed this rule.
Journalism is different, though. We don’t use the Oxford comma; we believe that the “and” is already enough to separate two different ideas. In the spirit of simplicity, we do away with the Oxford comma that we learned to love in our elementary English classes.
With the English language in constant evolution, we must ask ourselves — should we use it in our writing? This is with the exception of journalistic-style writing, as the rule of having no Oxford commas is hard and fast.
The answer is: it’s up to you. The Oxford comma is one of those grammar rules that depends on what suits your writing style or what makes the most sense in the context of your written work.
I’m sorry to break it to you, but the Oxford comma that we all have known to love or hate is no longer vital to the grammatical feasibility of our essays. It’s not completely gone though — there is an ongoing debate among academic professionals whether or not the Oxford comma is still necessary.
There are those who say that without the Oxford comma, your written work can become confusing:
In the hospital waiting room there was a nurse, a pregnant woman and a construction worker.
Without the Oxford comma, you might jump to the conclusion that the pregnant woman is also a construction worker, which would obviously not make any sense. So you would rephrase it with the Oxford comma to avoid confusion:
In the hospital waiting room there was a nurse, pregnant woman, and a construction worker.
Those who are for the Oxford comma argue that the sentence can be re-ordered to avoid the aforementioned confusion:
In the hospital waiting room there was a construction worker, a nurse and a pregnant woman.
Ultimately, it is up to the writer to include or exclude the Oxford comma. The Oxford comma is completely optional, and depends on the context of the sentence, so use it at your discretion. Also know that the Oxford comma will not be going away anytime soon.

In a show of solidarity for black students at the University of Missouri — and an acknowledgement of the shared experience of students of color at USC — hundreds of students gathered in Hahn Plaza Thursday, eventually protesting at Provost Michael Quick’s door and inciting an impromptu meeting with Quick and Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry. The surprise forum, which indicates an unprecedented and important move that students are finally being heard, created tangible impacts that cannot be understated. Promises for bi-weekly meetings, open forums, office hours, shortened Title IX response times and formal assignments of different administrators to address parts of the diversity resolution passed by the Undergraduate Student Government earlier this week are all essential steps to engaging students in a productive dialogue about improving the campus climate.
But still, the actions of the University administration in response to the protest — and protests across the country — indicate more that they are scared of additional negative publicity about USC’s campus climate, and quite frankly, for their own jobs following the resignations of top officials at other colleges across the country. In fact, earlier on Thursday, the Dean of Students at Claremont McKenna College resigned after students protested that the administration had failed to adequately address issues of racial discrimination. And according to student organizer Denys Reyes, that drastic step was taken because of mountains of negative publicity.
“The institution has only now started to respond to our efforts because it’s a PR crisis,” Reyes told KPCC.
Thus, in light of the resignations both at Claremont McKenna College and at the University of Missouri earlier in the week, it’s hard to believe that the University choosing now to finally respond to student advocacy is an issue of remaining accountable to students as opposed to avoiding a publicity disaster.
The administration’s mixed intentions manifests in its continuation of muddled promises to students advocating for diversity. At the meeting Thursday, Quick and Carry were insistent on repeating that they are “committed” to diversity, that they are “committed” to having these conversations and that they are “committed” to making students feel safe on campus. But if the administration is truly — truly — committed, it shouldn’t have to tell students that. It should have proven to students that it has an action plan to address the issues students have brought to the forefront of advocacy. And though administrators took responsibility for their lack of transparency about possible developments, they continue to be unclear whether the promises that they have made are concrete or will result in tangible change.
Maybe administrators are responding to students now because they’re afraid of the consequences that have unfolded at other universities that ignored calls for reform. But, if their efforts result in concrete changes for students on campus, maybe it doesn’t matter whether or not the administration is sincere.
It’s easy for students of color to feel exhausted, invisible and unheard by a University administration largely dominated by old, white men who don’t seem to know or care about the minority experience at USC — though, to be fair, that dynamic may be changing soon. But the national publicity of resignations of top positions at universities nationwide, combined with the show of support from students across the country, indicate that the nation is undeniably on the cusp of a historic movement about how race is being treated in higher education.
So it’s a good time to be a diversity advocate at the University. To the hundreds of students who skipped class to rally for solidarity, spent countless hours drafting and arguing for the difficult passage of the USG diversity resolution and continued to advocate for fostering a climate of real acceptance: Your work does not go unnoticed, and it is not over. And advocates must seize the political momentum now to hold administrators accountable.
Student leaders have done more than their fair share of figuring out what the administration should do to make students feel welcome. And though it is commendable that the administration is concretely allocating time to meet and discuss with students about diversity issues, it is now the time — no, it is far past the time — for them to be a pioneer of navigating the complex and difficult task of making higher education welcome for everyone.
“Campus crybullies”.  They exist at USC now.
Crybullies have learned to weaponize their status as a victim, a coveted label of the Left. They have two calling cards, race and gender.  They have the unsophisticated ideological wiring of a Rev. Al Sharpton or a Michael Moore.  
Race came first. In 2001 Harvard president Larry Summers suggested that Cornel West— an African American Studies professor — get serious after West produced a rap CD called “Sketches of My Culture.” Summers also asked West fight a then-growing grade inflation scandal at Harvard, where one of every two grades was an A or A-.
Chaos erupted. Black professors at Harvard threatened to leave— Mr. West moved to Princeton. The leftwing editorial board of the New York Times criticized Mr. Summers, who quickly recanted, calling it all “a terrible misunderstanding.”
Then came gender. In 2005 Mr. Summers spoke at MIT about diversity. He speculated on why there aren’t more women scientists at elite universities. He touched on several possibilities: Maybe there were “patterns of discrimination” at work.. Maybe women preferred family over career. Or maybe, just possibly, it had something to do with “different availability of aptitude.”
Women professors blew a fuse. “I felt I was going to be sick,” wailed Nancy Hopkins, a biology professor at MIT, who left. “My heart was pounding and my breath was shallow, low,” Ms. Hopkins said. “I was extremely upset.”
Once again, Summers recanted. He published an open letter. “I deeply regret the impact of my comments,” he wrote, “and apologize for not having weighed them more carefully.” It was too late. By May 2005 his faculty had returned a vote of no confidence 218 to 185, with 18 abstentions. By February 2006 he was forced to resign.
These two incidents,having happened at Harvard, marked a turning point. The pleasures of aggression now were added to the comforts of feeling aggrieved, or victimized.
The toxic fruits of this development are on view not only at Yale and Mizzou, but throughout the higher-educational establishment, where spurious charges of “systemic racism,” “a culture of rape” and sundry other imaginary torts compete for the budget of pity and special treatment.
Amherst College is currently exploding with nonnegotiable demands from a student group that the president apologize for white supremacy, colonialism, anti-black racism, anti-Latin racism, anti-Native American racism, anti-Native/ indigenous racism, anti-Asian racism, anti-Middle Eastern racism, heterosexism, cis-sexism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, ableism, mental health stigma, and classism.” Really, you can’t make it up.
Weak, liberal university presidents are capitulating. Yale’s president told “student crybullies” who complained that they did not feel “safe” at Yale that “we failed you.” Yale College dean found himself “surrounded by a sea of upturned faces and fighting back tears” so he apologized for the administration’s silence on allegations of racial discrimination.
When the brilliant conservative lawyer Amy Wax spoke at the Yale Political Union last week, a group of students stood up, turned their backs on her, and raised their fists in the air in protest. “Several students,” the Yale Daily News reported, “cried during her speech.”
A few days later, Dean Holloway and other university administrators met with about 100 students at his home and sacrificed his self-respect to serve the progressive “crybully” culture. “I have disappointed you and I’m really sorry,” he said.
The confrontation “just broke my heart,” Mr. Christakis added. “I care so much about the same issues you care about. I’ve spent my life taking care of these issues of injustice, of poverty, of racism. I have the same beliefs that you do . . . I’m genuinely sorry, and to have disappointed you. I’ve disappointed myself.”
Groveling by progressive administrators to crybullies with far-fetched social justice claims is the “cool” response.
These episodes—embarrassing to any person of self-respect and many of which might be inspired by Maoist public-shaming events—underscores the surreal and silly quality of life at some American colleges now.
For the “campus crybully”, reality takes second place to progressive ideology.
The truth is that American universities are the safest and most coddled environments ever created by man. But “campus crybullies” have given up any hope of acquiring an education — they are often liberal arts majors who see no hiring once they graduate — so they focus on staying at college to push grievance and hoax racism, even manufacturing and growing slights into major race bigotry.
“Campus crybullies” are about timid moral self-indulgence.
There are encouraging signs. When a dean at Claremont College resigned on Thursday after “camopus crybullies” accused the dean of racism because of a carelessly worded email, some brave students at the Claremont Independent published a dissenting editorial in which they berated hypersensitive students for bringing spurious charges of racism and the dean and the president for cowardice in not standing up to the barrage.
“Lastly,” they wrote, “we are disappointed in students like ourselves, who were scared into silence. We are not racist for having different opinions. We are not immoral because we don’t buy the flawed rhetoric of a spiteful movement.”
Courage is nearly non-existent on campuses today. Operating under the rubric of “progressive saviors”, these “social justice warriors” lack such courage. They are shallow masquerading as something more serious.  Open-minded students at Claremont provided a breath of fresh air. It will be interesting to see if it penetrates the fetid atmosphere that has settled over so much of American academic life.
It’s time to demand that the position of Athletic Director that is rumored to open soon be given to a woman.  So far there is only secrecy surrounding the search for a successor to Mr. Haden and I suspect that is because no women are being considered.
In light of the current state of affairs on campuses throughout our country, it would be wrong for USC to exclude women from this process
Discrimination via gender quotas?  Seriously?  How about giving it to “the most qualified”?  You know, as in fairness, not discriminatory balance.
I really appreciate this article and the author brings up good points. However, the line “…a University administration largely dominated by old, white men….” is disingenuous. Dr. Carry, Vice President of University Affairs, is black and young. Provost Quick is also young. President Nikias is an immigrant. The Provost for Faculty is a woman who is in her 40s, the youngest in the country for the job, and black. Also, the President for Admissions and Planning is a woman. Our Dean of Religious Life, Dr. Soni, is one of only a handful of campus religious directors that isn’t white and is the ONLY one that is of Indian descent. In fact, 7/16 of senior campus administrators are woman. Seth brings up some good points but quick, judgmental statements about the age and gender of senior administrators without any research brings questions of validity to some of her other claims as well, unfortunately.

The Los Angeles County Supervisors recently devised a $100 million-a-year plan to combat the rampant issue of affordable housing by 2020. The affordable housing fund, authored by Supervisors Sheila Kuehl and Mark Ridley-Thomas, was led last month by a unanimous vote in favor. The fund seeks to construct and maintain affordable housing, which might include rental subsidies and welfare programs such as aid in healthcare, law enforcement, social services and land use planning. But the plan of action for the project is still unclear. And since it is confusing where the funding will derive from, the plan seems to be nothing but ambitious. Los Angeles and its constituents cannot afford another decade of uncertainty. Similar to the Los Angeles Affordable Housing Trust Fund, this too seeks to initiate momentum for change in the housing markets, but this scene is all too familiar. Though L.A. policymakers realize the necessity to fund such projects, they fail to account for the necessity of public transparency.
Millennials are leaving Los Angeles. A wave of disenchanted Gen Y’ers and even Gen X’ers who cannot afford the expensive housing are relocating to reside in Whittier, La Habra and La Mirada, yet make the commute each day to work in the city. Meanwhile, prices in Whittier, for example, are steadily increasing, contributing to the problem of gentrification and the cycle of poverty. The median home price in Los Angeles is $640,000, according to Trulia, while the average apartment rental in the city is more than $2,000 per month. According to Matt Schwartz, president and chief executive officer of the California Housing Partnership Corporation, Angelenos must earn at least $33 per hour, which translates to $68,640 a year, to be able to afford the average price for an apartment in Los Angeles.
While the Los Angeles City Council proposal to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour temporarily lessens the burden on workers, it does nothing to combat the issue of affordable housing. Policymakers in Los Angeles might issue concerns to create a plan that works in conjunction with uplifting our poorest workers while fixing issues of affordable housing.
Viable steps to move Los Angeles forward hinge on the creation of a readily educated workforce with skills equipped to move beyond middle class jobs, tax incentives to hire local workers and permanent housing developments, which do not put the existing property prices at a disadvantage. One of the plan’s vital elements direct policymakers to fix the problem before it happens: preservation of pre-existing low cost apartments which are arranged to transition to market-rate rent prices. In doing so, current Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has proposed a plan to create a fee on developers to fund affordable housing which is thought to generate anywhere from $37-112 million per year, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Garcetti said he would study and ultimately propose the city’s first ever fee on developers to fund affordable housing. A fee for commercial and residential developments could generate $37-112 million a year. But developers and homeowner associations in opposition to the proposed mandates allocated to generate funding for low-income housing explain that the higher density could create mixed income housing projects to dissolve, while public funding is redirected to new crises, the L.A. Times editorial board notes.
Angelenos are tired of waiting for something to change. Let’s fight for funding to combat homelessness and poverty in Los Angeles. Finally, let’s see where the end of this year will take us.

End of the year? A lot more will be homeless from this bigotry and discrimination. They are ripping us off and forcing us into slum properties with cockroaches and forcing us to pay. Even after rent raise in ghetto areas. You cant even afford the ghettos it’s that bad. They have no safety nets for disabled or sick. I’ve been fighting for help 11 yrs now after a fucked up LE thing. No one knows why I’m sick huh. Ya well ppl have done everything to block my test. So welfare knew I was ill and gave a few week voucher in a slum hotel with bugs not women friendly and my state threw me on the street with no care. $300 doesn’t even rent a room here. They left me to die. I’m still after all these years fighting these corrupt hilter people.

After a win against Arizona at home last week, the Trojans are taking a three-game win streak —their longest of the season — to Boulder, Colorado, to face the Buffs in a Friday night matchup. The Trojans improved to 6-3 with the win while Colorado’s loss to Stanford last week dropped them to 4-6.
USC’s three-game win streak has been led by redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler, who has completed 70.9 percent of his passes with three touchdowns and no interceptions. In the face of mounting injuries, tailback Ronald Jones II has also stepped up to help the Trojans win, rushing for a USC freshman record 177 yards on 19 carries against Arizona to help the team overcome an early 14-0 deficit.
“This is a different Colorado team than we’ve faced over the last couple of years,” interim head coach Clay Helton said. “I just look at them, and I know the wins aren’t coming to them like they would like. But you look at the way they’re competing against some really quality teams right now, and they seem like they’re in every game.”
Meanwhile, Kessler’s counterpart, junior quarterback Sefo Liufau, has completed just 61.7 percent of his passes with nine touchdowns to six interceptions. He has a lot of help on offense, however, in the form of senior wide receiver Nelson Spruce. Spruce leads Colorado and the Pac-12 with 272 career receptions. He has 67 receptions this season alone. Sophomore Shay Fields complements Spruce with 36 catches and a team-high four touchdowns. Colorado’s rushing offense is spread among a lot of backs, with six different players having at least 40 carries. The run game has been diminished as of late due to injury.
On the other side of the ball, Colorado’s defense is the worst in the Pac-12 in rushing defense, allowing 208.9 yards per game. In pass defense, however, the Buffs are fourth in the conference and eighth in the conference in total defense.
For the Trojans, a slowed down tempo more reliant on running the ball has seemed to work after starting the season 3-3. Since they’ll be facing the worst rushing defense in the Pac-12, it’s hard to see that changing. Colorado has allowed 200 rushing yards in five of its last six games, and USC’s rushing has been the difference for the team. Running back Tre Madden will again be sidelined with injury, but the duo of Justin Davis and Jones is more than enough to make up for the loss of Madden.
“This team, no matter what happens, no matter what’s coming, they keep fighting back,” Kessler said. “We know how to handle adversity.”
Sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster finished last week’s game against Arizona with eight catches for 138 yards despite fracturing his hand the week before. He will be a nice complement to the Trojans’ slow and steady run game.
The Trojan defense held Arizona to a season-low 60 rushing yards last week with a season-high six sacks. The biggest threat to the defense is Spruce, but if the Trojans can take Spruce out of the equation and force Colorado to run the ball, Jones and Davis can outmatch the Buffs on the ground and Kessler can do so in the air.
“If you can keep the ball away from a very powerful offense like Colorado, it will help you,” Helton said. “Offensively, that’s our responsibility to our defense.”
Perhaps the biggest threat to the Trojans’ success is the projected below freezing temperatures. If the Trojans can beat the cold, however, they should be able to notch their 10th all-time win against Colorado.
Kick off is set for 6 p.m. in Boulder, Colorado.

The men’s basketball team will kick off its season against the visiting San Diego Toreros this Friday night. The Trojans will hope to kickstart a successful season in head coach Andy Enfield’s third year at the helm. Enfield has gone a combined 23-41 in his first two years as head coach, including back-to-back last-place finishes in the Pac-12. The Men of Troy are 3-0 all time against the Toreros, and this will be the first meeting between the two schools since USC’s 60-50 victory in 2007.
The Trojans are returning almost every player from last year’s squad, including standouts Elijah Stewart, Katin Reinhardt and Nikola Jovanovic. Enfield has also added two top prospects in forwards Chimezie Metu and Bennie Boatwright.
Metu, a 6-foot-11 power forward, averaged 18 points and 11 rebounds last season for Lawndale High School en route to being named CIF Southern Section Division II Player of the Year. As impressive as Metu was in high school, Boatwright may have been better. The 6-foot-10 sharpshooter from Village Christian High School averaged a whopping 27.8 points and 13 rebounds. Boatwright was named the CIF Southern Section 1AA Player of the year. Both freshmen figure to contribute heavily to a team lacking front court depth.
After being one the youngest teams in the NCAA last season with no seniors and just one junior on the roster, this year’s USC squad is much more mature. This season’s roster will feature players with 209 starts in a USC uniform, compared to just 52 last season, a stat that Enfield hopes will help the Trojans turn the corner.
“We allowed our players to play through their mistakes last season. They were young and inexperienced. We were competitive last season,” Enfield said. “We just were not able to win a lot of close games, but with a year of experience, bodies being more developed physically … understanding how to win close games, we hope the growing pains we went through last season will show up as some more victories this season.”
Last season’s key additions, freshmen Elijah Stewart and Jordan McLaughlin and redshirt junior transfer Katin Reinhardt, look ready to take on a greater role. Stewart and Reinhardt were phenomenal at the end of last season, and McLaughlin had offseason surgery to finally rid himself of shoulder troubles that plagued his freshman campaign.
Junior Nikola Jovanovic, who averaged 12.3 points and seven rebounds per game last season, hopes to continue his growth as the team’s leader. Jovanovic improved dramatically last season, raising his statistics in every category from his freshman year. The addition of Boatwright and Metu should help Jovanovic down low as the Serbian has never really played with another dominating big man.
“We’re looking for a great season,” Jovanovic said. “The last two years were a rebuilding process with a new coaching staff, new players and we were trying to put everything in place. This year, with the right pieces, we’re covered in every single position pretty well. We feel pretty comfortable going into the new season.”
The Trojans are still a very young team but the team should outperform last year’s team dramatically.
USD will enter the Galen Center coming off a 15-16 season that saw their head coach Bill Grier get fired. Lamont Smith will take over as head coach after previous stints as an assistant at Arizona State and Washington.
The Toreros lost their top three scorers from last season to graduation and are a rather young team with six freshmen on the roster. The Toreros are returning only two starters from last year’s team that finished fifth in the West Coast Conference.
The Trojans are 74-35 overall in season openers and had won six in a row before last year’s shocking defeat to Portland State. With the Pac-12 becoming more competitive this season, the Trojans will need to pick up these early season wins if they hope to make it into the NCAA Tournament.
Tipoff is set for Friday at 5 p.m. The game will air on the Pac-12 Network.

With temperatures expected to be in the 20s by game time, it’s going to be relatively chilly when USC takes on Colorado on Friday the 13th — the first time either team has ever played on the superstitious date.
Currently on a three-game winning streak, you would think that all the Trojans have to do to come away with a win against the Buffs on Friday, in theory, is avoid broken mirrors and black cats. More importantly, though, they need to stay warm in the cold tundra that is Boulder.
It’s going to be tough for the Buffs to simply freeze one of the hottest teams in the Pac-12 right now — unless they have someone that resembles Mr. Freeze from the 1997 Batman and Robin  film.
It’s not the weather that’s cooled the Trojans down in the past, however. They’ve been their own greatest downfall and enemy all season long. When they execute Clay Helton’s game plan of stopping the run, running the ball and not turning it over, they appear to be the best team in the Pac-12. That was evident against Utah when the Trojans defense forced four turnovers and held DeVontae Booker to a season-low 62 yards while powering in four touchdowns on the ground.
So what if it is a blueprint for success that derives from David Shaw and the Stanford Cardinal? It’s no wonder that Shaw has been thrown into the mix of the USC coaching search here and there for that reason, but in a very short time, Helton has gotten his team to buy in at last.
It’s really been a long time coming for a team that was nothing but erratic up until its most recent winning streak.
It can be funny to think about on the surface, but, pre-Clay Helton, this USC team could have been perfectly described by Katy Perry’s hit song “Hot N Cold” — in reverse order — similar to the Star Wars epic.
The Trojans were hot, then they were cold; they were yes we’re a good football team, then they were no; they were in the Pac-12 South race, then they were out; they were up, then they were down.
I’m not Shakespeare, but in a drama, the sequence of events in the plot line is everything. Initially, it appeared that the termination of former head coach Steve Sarkisian was going to be the climax of the team’s season and the team’s tough loss at Notre Dame appeared to serve as the falling action.
A loss to Utah would have effectively fulfilled the element of the denouement.
In spite of the fact that so many people wrote them off when they were down, the Trojans have decided to rewrite this story, and they’re fortunate that they have decided to heat up at the right time, heading down the stretch with a legitimate shot to win the South division.
A happy ending is not a guarantee, though. Another tale in recent years comes to mind.
In 2013, Ed Orgeron, best known as “Coach O,” took the Trojans on a 6-2 run to cap off the regular season and reinstalled the spirit of the Trojan Family after the tarmac canning of Lane Kiffin. Orgeron wasn’t offered the head coaching job, however, after losing to UCLA at home in the team’s final game, which ended a five-game winning streak.
If USC is able to take care of business against Colorado and go to Eugene the week after and beat Oregon, it will once again be riding a five-game going into its most important game of the year against its crosstown rivals.
The two stories are very similar in nature, but Helton and his team are hoping to capture a different conclusion.
A win against the Bruins in the Trojans regular season finale to win the Pac-12 South and send them to the conference title game could ensure that Helton and the Trojans live happily ever after.

The men’s water polo team will face its toughest test yet on Sunday afternoon, facing the No. 1- ranked UCLA Bruins on the road in the final match of the regular season.
Ranked fourth in the nation, a Trojans’ victory against the top-seeded Bruins would go a long way toward improving their psyche heading into the MPSF and NCAA Tournaments.
“The boys are really pumped up to play UCLA next week, and hopefully we come away with a win,” junior driver Blake Edwards said.
It won’t come easy. The Bruins are undefeated this season, coming in at 24-0 overall and 8-0 in MPSF competition. Dating back to last season, they have won 26 consecutive games, their second longest streak in school history.
Though the Trojans came away victorious over the Bruins in last year’s SoCal Tournament by a 10-6 score, UCLA has won four straight matches over USC, including the 2014 NCAA Championship.
Last week, the Bruins beat No. 6 UC Santa Barbara at home 9-4 and No. 8 Long Beach State 11-4 on the road, which locked up the No. 1 seed for UCLA in the MPSF Tournament next week. UCLA goaltender Garrett Danner had 28 saves on the weekend, and his 5.98 goals against per game ranks first in the conference.
Preparing for UCLA will be difficult, but USC appears confident and ready for the challenge.
“We focused a lot on our defense,” Edwards said. “Throughout the season our defense has been our best stat, and the past few games the other offense has really hurt us, so [defense is] our focus as we go into the next game.”
Teams like to say they treat every opponent the same, but redshirt senior Mac Carden could not resist hyping up the rivalry.
“We prepare for every team the same,” Carden said. “It’s a big game. Crosstown rivalry. We’re looking to come out with a win.”
Though UCLA, the defending national champion, is a proven powerhouse, the Trojans have plenty of talent and the ability to compete with the Bruins. The only other meeting between these two teams this season came in the SoCal Tournament Final, and it took a tiebreaking goal by UCLA’s Patrick Fellner with 15 seconds to play for the Bruins to escape with a 10-9 win.
“We just need to relax a little bit more,” Edwards said. “Stay calm and confident going into the next game. We have some good vibes. Everyone’s excited, and we look forward to it.”
USC is coming off a 14-8 win over No. 7 UC Irvine on Senior Day last Sunday, which snapped a two-game losing streak. Edwards recorded four goals and the Trojans used a spurt in the second period to pull away. Goalie McQuin Baron recorded 11 saves, the ninth time he has reached double-digits in saves this season.
After Sunday’s match, the Trojans will prepare to host the MPSF Tournament at home from Nov. 20-22, where they will either be seeded third or fourth.

It’s impossible to deny that the revitalization of downtown Los Angeles is partly due to its vast art scene. With vibrant murals scaling historic buildings and galleries on almost every street, Downtown is now a cultural hub. Additionally, the presence of the Museum of Contemporary Art and the recent opening of the Broad Museum further emphasize the role art plays in the neighborhood. The Downtown Art Walk, which takes place every second Thursday each month, celebrates this fact.
More than 30 galleries participated in the Art Walk on Nov. 12. During this time, visitors traveled throughout the various locations, including The Hive Gallery & Studios, located on Spring Street. Nathan Cartwright, owner and curator of The Hive, opened the gallery in 2005, when there were only a handful of other art spaces open in Downtown. Since the opening of The Hive collided with the beginning of the Art Walk, Cartwright has seen the correlation between the development of Downtown and the art that supports the city center.
“People want to feel a sense of adventure, and that sense of adventure generally comes from culture,” Cartwright said. “For young people and old people alike, restaurants, movies, books and so on are only a small part of the equation. Art is something that is in your face, so it’s been a crucial factor in people getting down here.”
According to Cartwright, the galleries downtown present a crossroads for people of all socioeconomic backgrounds. Art allows different people to share a common experience.
“You don’t have to have the internet to walk into a gallery,” Cartwright said. “What’s happening to a lot of art is people going to Instagram and stuff like that. But to actually have a real, cathartic experience, to actually see the texture and see the materials, you have to go to a gallery.”
On display at The Hive was the Master Blasters of Sculpture exhibition, which premiered on Nov. 8. Additionally, along with the works from 20 featured artists, The Hive showcased a ukiyo-e project in one of their studio spaces. The ukiyo-e genre, a type of traditional Japanese printing, was modernized through the use of imagery from the band KISS.
Other thriving places included the Ren Gallery, which had a reception in anticipation of its grand opening. A tribute to pop artist Richard Duardo was the central focus of its display, though pieces by local contemporary and street artists such as Nicholas Knudson, Jaime Colindres and Des Grisham could also be found. Fold Gallery also highlighted Los Angeles artists in their collection, including pieces by Patrick Haemmerlein, Walt Hall and Jon Measures.
Though art was the focal point of the night, other components added to the experience. Dozens of food trucks parked on 3rd Street, creating the perfect resting place for patrons. The space was accompanied by live music, and hungry people flocked to Belly BombZ, Kabob Kings and Surfer Tacos. The Last Bookstore also made for a notable stop. With extended hours, the shop presented its own art on the second floor while Presence, a musical quintet, played downstairs.
Undoubtedly, the Downtown Art Walk is an integral part of the growing city. An event easily accessible to USC students, this monthly tradition allows people to feel connected to one another.

Celebrity memoirs have been on the rise, and as a subgroup of that, many internet celebrities have published their own books. Most of these are autobiographies, but some have tried out fiction as well.
I have to admit that in the past I’ve been skeptical of these sort of celebrity tell-alls. I’m tempted to assume that they’re salacious and nothing more than a money-spinning scheme. That all changed when I started researching for this column. YouTubers, more than any other sort of celebrity, seem to have an incredible amount of compassion as well as very serious stories to tell. Perhaps this is because so many internet celebrities have turned to cyberspace to find a forum where they feel comfortable and accepted, not being able to find this in their day-to-day life. The more I read, the more I felt ashamed for condemning these books without knowing anything about them. Many of them tell stories of incredible suffering, struggles with identity and social acceptance. In addition, because these are individuals who have succeeded in entertaining millions of people, they have very unique and clever voice, and are able to tell their story in a fresh way. The majority of these YouTube stars are also young, mostly teenagers and college students, so as students ourselves, these books may be the most accessible autobiographies available to us today.
There are so many books by YouTubers out there, but I wanted to talk about a few that I feel really capture what this new genre is all about, and also show all the different facets of what these novels have to offer. There is Zoe Sugg’s fiction novel, Girl Online. As you can probably imagine from the title, much of this book is heavily influenced by Sugg’s own experiences. For those who haven’t heard of her, Sugg, otherwise known as Zoella, is a British fashion, beauty and lifestyle YouTuber with more than 9 million subscribers, making her channel the 54th most popular on YouTube. She’s been a famous face online for many years, but reached new heights of success with the release of Girl Online last year, which broke the
all-time record for first-week book sales by a first-time author. This statistic, if anything, shows the power of YouTube celebrity power. It’s a young adult romance about a girl who blogs about her life, including her adventures with “Brooklyn Boy,” someone she meets in New York. Yes, it’s a fluffy teen romance, but it also discusses the reality of navigating relationships as a teenager in the digital age and the various ups and downs that come along with it.
Binge by Tyler Oakley is a new release. Oakley is widely heralded as the most prominent LGBTQ voice on YouTube and is famous for sharing intimate details about his life with his extensive list of subscribers. His autobiography continues in this vein, discussing important issues and giving many people who may otherwise not have had support, all in his outrageous and hilarious signature style.
Another similar book that tells very important and serious stories of online personalities is A Work in Progress: A Memoir by Connor Franta. Franta, of course, is another YouTube sensation, but his book is a little different from many other memoirs in that it takes a solemn and thoughtful stance. Of course there is humor, but he is also discussing some very dark issues. He talks about his upbringing in the Midwest and his struggles with his identity, sexuality and body image. It’s a book that talks about real issues that young people all face, among navigating a new type of fame and figuring out a future within that.
There are so many other memoirs by these YouTube stars, I was overwhelmed trying to decide which ones to include here. This is by no means a comprehensive list, as every individual brings his or her own voice that garnered them success in print as well. What truly interested me, though, was what has led to the polarization of this new genre. I talked in an earlier column about the rise in celebrity memoirs and our desire to know everything about the celebrities we idolize and wish to know them on an intimate level. To an extent, the same is true in this case, but this new sub-genre is popular for a slightly different reason. Most YouTubers have a message or a story that is interesting enough, and told in such a way, that it has kept millions of individuals around the world waiting for the next video or update. That is an incredible talent to have, but I also think that these individuals are much more relatable. They aren’t billionaires or movie stars; they’re millennials with a computer just trying to figure out who they are and using the internet as a forum to do that. For that reason, these memoirs and books are a refreshing read that tell stories we have never heard before.

Even a high quality camera didn’t do the beauty of the Alps justice, Blogger Maya Anderman said. Photo contributed by Maya Anderman | Daily Trojan
Our generation has been taught to process the beautiful things we see in this world by taking photos. This isn’t necessarily a negative attribute; it’s just what we have come to know.
I have been to a lot of unbelievable places in the past three months. Whether it be the green hills of Scotland or the gorgeous mosaic houses of Barcelona, anytime I’m in one of these locations my immediate instinct is to take out my phone and take a picture. I didn’t realize how much of a “norm” this was until I came to London, and seeing these amazing sites became a weekly occurrence (I assure you the objective of this post is not to brag about how awesome study abroad life is, even though it is quite awesome). However, this past weekend was the first time I came to a place and was so completely stunned I didn’t know how to process or capture it — not even with a photo.
A few friends of mine from home are studying abroad in Italy, so I decided to take a weekend and go visit them. My friend Megan lives in a city called Turin, which is about an hour outside of Milan, very close to the Alps. On Halloween we decided to go on a little adventure and hike in the Alps. First off, I don’t think I ever thought I would come to a point in my life where I would be able to use that sentence in a serious context, “Oh yeah I’m just going to hike the Italian Alps, I’ll be back in a bit!” Super casual. I couldn’t even grasp the concept, so one can imagine my pure shock when we actually got there and started hiking. I just kept thinking that there was no way any of this was real. It was by far one of the most beautiful things I had seen in my entire life. It was one of those experiences that is impossible to describe, but something I know I will cherish forever.
I see pictures of places like this every day, on calendars, postcards and Buzzfeed articles, yet when I was actually there in real life I didn’t know how to process it. All of a sudden something I had always seen as a small pixelated image was completely surrounding me. So how do you take it all in? As I said in the beginning of this post, mine (and most people’s) automatic go-to is to whip out your phone and take a ton of photos. That’s what you’re supposed to do — capture the moment so you remember it forever. However, every time I brought out my phone I would just get frustrated that my tiny iPhone 6 camera wasn’t doing this place any justice. I actually found myself overwhelmed because I had become so reliant on my camera to process experiences like this that I didn’t know what to do.
After I take all these pictures, occasionally I’ll upload a few to social media and then export them onto my computer. I’ll look through them every so often when I’m feeling nostalgic, but realistically, they don’t really serve much use for me after I take them. So why do I feel the need to take hundreds everywhere I go? I’m not saying people should take fewer photos when they are sightseeing. I think having those pictures can be extremely important. I know in a few months when I’m sitting in Leavey Library at 4 a.m., stressing out about a research paper, I’ll look back through these photos from the Alps and be happy I have them to reminisce on.
In the end, this trip was a lesson and reminder to really be present in whatever you’re doing, because no matter how many pictures you take, or the quality of the photo itself, they will never truly be able to let you relive those moments. In addition to documenting things physically, it’s also important to document them emotionally. Sometimes you just have to take a mental picture, try and hold onto that feeling and imagine you are experiencing that particular moment for as long as possible.

A few weeks Adele once again rocked the musical world — actually, the world as a whole — with “Hello.” The single off of her upcoming album 25 is an emotionally intense ballad about love, loss and all the complexities that come with that. It takes a great amount of courage to match the soaring vocals of the acclaimed British songstress, but these five brave Youtube stars have risen to the challenge.
1. Rhyon and Major
This heart-wrenching duet from two rising vocalists is filled with the R&B soul Adele’s original craves. Actress and USC alum, Rhyon certainly proves her singing chops with this track. Hopefully, there’s more to come from her in the future. 

2. Leroy Sanchez
Perhaps the cover that has garnered the most media attention, singer-songwriter Leroy Sanchez’s version astounds listeners. Sanchez hits all of those impossible high notes, and while he’s had successful covers in the past, the vocal range he demonstrates here makes it the most impressive.

3. Lianna Joy
An emerging cover star, Lianna Joy takes on Adele’s single by speeding up the piano track and bringing it down an octave or two to make it more manageable. That, however, does not take away from Joy’s incredible vocal talent — the intensity of her emotion is palpable through the screen.

4. Stephen
Silverlake-based singer-songwriter Stephen completely captivated me. He incorporates instrumental guitar to give the ballad a rock ‘n’ roll edginess. Yet, he maintains the integrity of the track with his raw, emotional vocals. Stephen also adds a new twist on the cover by combining it with “Rolling in the Deep.”

Another male singer-songwriter steps up to the plate, but this time adds a unique flair when it comes to the production. Rather than sticking to the piano ballad or acoustic track, he mixes those with a drumbeat, adding the depth of an R&B song.

Music from Big Pink is a beautiful hidden gem — a piece of buried treasure that delights those who are fortunate enough to dig it up. Released in June 1968, it is The Band’s (yes, they are really called “The Band”) debut studio album. The album’s title refers to a house in New York that The Band bassist and songwriter Rick Danko rented out as a place to record music with collaborator Bob Dylan (who drew Music from Big Pink’s album cover). Danko later moved in the other members of The Band to begin work on their debut record.
The name fits; the Big Pink house looks as charming as its namesake sounds. Music from Big Pink is an amalgamation of folk, blues, soul and old-fashioned country music. It is the product of a group of incredibly talented multi-instrumentalists and songwriters — Rick Danko, Robby Robertson, Levon Helm, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson — coming together and simply making music. Indeed, its deceptive simplicity is what makes Big Pink an awe-inspiring album. Not many albums that display Big Pink’s subtle levels of musical complexity are able to remind its listeners of a simpler time.
At least that’s what Big Pink does for me. Yet the feelings of nostalgia it evokes, strangely enough, don’t remind me of my own past. Rather, the record takes me to America’s past, to some trope of the American aesthetic we encounter time and time again when reading about the simple lives of frontiersmen, romanticized by Thoreau and Whitman. I’ve lived in coastal California all my life, yet Big Pink makes me feel as if I understand America’s heartland more than any history book could.
This is partly due to its compelling storytelling. For instance, “The Weight,” which is undoubtedly the record’s most recognizable song, tells the story of a young man visiting Nazareth, PA to help a woman named Fanny. In the town, he encounters various unique characters, all of whom enlist the storyteller’s help. Not only is “The Weight” brimming with soul, it reminds us that profound lessons can be found in unexpected places by revealing the complex problems of a small, modest town.
“The Weight” has a particularly special place in my heart, for it was one of the first songs I learned to play on the drums years ago. It quickly became — and remains to this day — a go-to “jam song” for my stepdad and me.
“Tears of Joy,” the album’s opener, is another one of Big Pink’s most powerful tracks. It was originally written by Bob Dylan, but The Band made it something entirely their own. Every one of its elements is filled with agony — Levon Helm’s slow, thumping drum patterns; Robbie Robertson’s wailing guitar; Rick Danko’s strained vocals. Yet, there are no bells and whistles. “Tears of Rage” — like the rest of the album — finds magic in the unadorned roots of rock ‘n’ roll. 
So much can be said about Big Pink’s 20-song tracklist. But none of it, of course, could compare with simply sitting down and listening to it. From its cover — one that looks like it could be displayed in a modern art museum — to the last note of “Ferdinand the Imposter,” Big Pink is a reminder that the only thing music truly needs to be effective is soul.

Shalom & Erev tov…this is quite well-done, but one error: it was ‘Tears of Rage’, written by Shabtai Zisel/’Bob Dylan’ and Richard Manuel, three takes recorded in September 1967: Shabtai: lead vocals, acoustic 12 string guitar; Rick Danko, bass, backup vocal; Garth Hudson, organ; Richard Manuel, piano, backup vocal; Robbie Robertson, electric guitar. Levon Helm came to Woodstock in October 1967, sharing a house with Rick Danko on Wittenberg Road near Bearsville, and it was there that Shabtai and The Band (now, once again, with Levon on drums)  recorded the remaining ‘basement tapes’ (9 songs). The first song they recorded 10 January 1968 for MUSIC FROM BIG PINK was ‘Tears of Rage’/ Ironically they recorded in NYC, still calling themselves The Crackers…a name quickly abandoned.

For this week’s donut adventure, I took a trip to California Donuts, as the shop is so popular on social media. If you haven’t heard of them or been there, I’m sure you’ve at least seen photos of the legendary Panda Donut on Instagram. Despite its “Insta-worthy” donuts, I have to say it’s a little overrated. Don’t be fooled by the named; California Donuts is not the be-all, end-all of donut places in the state.
A few months ago, my parents stopped by California Donuts while they were in the area and brought me a Panda Donut and the Fruit Loops Donut since I had always talked about trying them. Though I didn’t get the full experience of going to the actual location, I was glad to finally see what all the fuss was about. Though I’ll admit the Panda donut is creative and adorable, there is nothing necessarily satiating about its flavor. I’m a huge fan of oreos, which were used to make up the eyes and ears, but in this case, they were a bit too soggy.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
On the other hand, the Fruit Loops Donut has probably been the best one that I’ve tasted. So many donut places are beginning to introduce cereal donuts, but I believe California Donuts is one of the few that has mastered their recipe. Asides from the Fruit Loops donut, they also offer ones with Lucky Charms and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. They’ve even experimented with M&M’s.

Another trending flavor lately is Matcha green tea donuts. California Donuts offers these in both regular and cronut. On my most recent trip, I chose to eat the Matcha Green Tea Cronut. I was very satisfied with it and would absolutely recommend it over the regular one. Even better, I would recommend refrigerating it for a few hours and eating it when it’s slightly colder — trust me, you won’t be disappointed.

Overall, I would say my trip to California Donuts was pleasant but not the best. Though I really admire the fact that they are open 24 hours, the location of the store is a bit inconvenient. As with most places in L.A., there was very limited parking, so I had to park a bit farther away and walk. Also, they do not have any seating areas, so I ended up eating my donuts in the car. 
For a place that is so popular, I think it would be a good investment to set up a more visitor-friendly area to create a welcoming ambiance. All in all, they are not my all-time favorite donuts, but regardless, I would still recommend visiting at least once in your life because it is such an iconic place in terms of city food in L.A.
California Donuts is open 24 hours all days of the week at 3540 W. 3rd St, Los Angeles, CA 9002024.
