In Malawi, the sick children at Mzuzu Central Hospital in dire need of medical attention were forced to lay on the floor. Life-saving drugs were out of stock. The patients outnumbered available doctors. These were just a few of the problems that Jared Alswang, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, witnessed when he traveled to Africa with the Norwegian nonprofit Luke International last summer. 
“I was doing an AIDS research project when I visited a hospital and toured the pediatric ward,” Alswang said. “The conditions were heartbreaking, to say the least. I asked a nurse if I could take a picture, and she said ‘of course, but don’t just take a picture and leave and forget about us.’” 
When he returned to USC, Alswang organized Project Malawi, a student group that aimed to fundraise to help improve conditions in Malawi hospitals. He immediately launched several campaigns, hoping to open two Medical High Dependency Units at Mzuzu Central Hospital and Chitipa District Hospital as well as a minor operating theatre at Nthalire Health Centre. He did a fundraiser with Alpha Epsilon Pi, which raised about $8,000 and later partnered with the Rotary Club of Mzuzu and the Lions Club. 
“Fundraising has been a lot of trial and error,” Alswang said. “I reached to hundreds of corporations but no one was interested. I tried to do it all myself but it was harder than I expected.” 
Realizing that a project with such a large size and scope would require the support of additional people, Alswang assembled a core team of students who assists him in handling the various aspects of Project Malawi, such as his co-president, Will Belshe, a junior majoring in global health. 
“Jared is the logistical side with the people of Malawi, while I’ve taken on more of the USC-centric portion of it,” Belshe said. “I’ve been working on outreach, talking to people in Alpha Epsilon Delta, [and the] Red Cross to co-opt efforts and talking to USG about funding. I’m most involved with the home turf aspect, while Jared is more international.” 
Together, Alswang and Belshe were able to bring Project C.U.R.E., a nonprofit organization that delivers medical supplies and equipment to developing countries, on board. They agreed to provide a 40-foot container with $400,000 to $500,000 worth of medical equipment and supplies to the Malawi hospitals. 
“I wrote a proposal for them to support the hospitals and they said they agreed to provide the crate of medical supplies, but I would have to fund the transportation costs, which is about $24,000,” Alswang said. “I’ve been working with them a lot, helping them to prepare the medical supplies they need, trying to raise the money.” 
Alswang and others in Project Malawi are already considering their next steps in how to further improve the medical facilities and treatment in the hospitals they have worked with. For example, they are applying for USC’s Africa Student Fund to go to Malawi again this summer and follow up with the steps they have taken so far.
“We want to talk to the medical school there about the possibility of setting up a scholarship with them to address the doctor shortage,” Belshe said. “We’re also looking into the idea of entering into infrastructure, water projects or expanding into a full-fledged nonprofit. I think there’s a lot of promise in the future.”

Ying Tao received her master’s of business administration from the Marshall School of Business in 2016, and she’s already making strides in the entrepreneurial world with her company G Box Club.
Based in Beverly Hills, Tao delivers on-demand care packages for women specializing in toiletries, clothes and flats. The inspiration for the company was derived from her hectic lifestyle at business school.
“If I was running around in my heels all day, and I would want to get out of them and go hang out with a friend or something, it would be amazing if I could just order flats on demand,” Tao said, remembering how her idea materialized. 
Tao said her goal with her company is to help women “feel comfortable and empowered.” G Box Club recently partnered with Postmates to help deliver the product, a process that took a lot longer than Tao expected.
Before reaching an agreement with Postmates, Tao had tried to use Uber drivers and a subscription model, but found this difficult. Postmates requires that she has a business location, and now with an office in Beverly Hills, Tao is ready to expand her product.
Though Tao’s company was officially incorporated in July 2016, she’s three weeks into her soft launch. Before she starts the hard launch, Tao is in the process of finding the best way to advertise G Box Club and use influencers to her advantage. Right now, Tao is trying to spread awareness of her company, and she is figuring out what her customers want.
“We’re testing out different products to see what products sell,” Tao said. “This is really just the beginning, but we’re just [focusing] on how to get the word out.”
When Tao entered business school, she didn’t envision starting her own business. She had her sights set on a high-paying, steady job. Tao said that all changed when she took her required entrepreneurship class. 
Tao and her partner had to create a business in a week and compete against other teams to see how much money they could make. They sold 3D- printed roses, and at one point, she remembers, they had sold 100 units in five hours. That initial idea got their company $5,000 when they made the finals of the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies’ New Venture Seed Competition.
“It was such an exciting process of having a concept and then selling the product and then getting it to the competition,” Tao said. 
Tao said that’s what attracted her to entrepreneurship and is part of the reason why she’s the CEO of her own company now. Tao is running the company on her own, without a co-founder, because she felt no one else could be as passionate as her.
Tao is already thinking ahead for her company. She sees G Box Club as a data test to see how much of a market there is for on-demand services. And in the near future, Tao is looking to make an app separate from Postmates.
It’s also been a learning process for Tao run a business and look for employees. 
“I wish I took more risks when I was younger,” she said.
Tao’s project has already garnered praise from popular figures on social media. Jennifer Adams, a digital influencer based in Los Angeles, said she was a huge fan of the “flats in a flash.”
“I will be out with my fiancé or girlfriends and get to that point in the night where I want to take off my heels,” Adams said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Flats straight to you, with a bag for your heels to protect them? Yes please!”
Along with the flats in a flash project, her latest care package for women comes just in time for Valentine’s Day. It allows customers to send Valentine grams to friends wherever they are, on or off campus. That’s just one of the many ways Tao envisions the future of her company.
“I just want it to be an on-demand service for men and women for products that they really need in their everyday lives,” Tao said.

Brian Chin | Daily TrojanHere to stay · Sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright drives the ball from the top of the key against a defender. After months spent on the sidelines due to injuries, Boatwright returned to the rotation last week.
After the unexpected departures of guard Julian Jacobs and forward Nikola Jovanovic to the NBA draft at the end of last season, head coach Andy Enfield knew that looking forward he would have to rely heavily on young talent. At least, co-captain sophomore Bennie Boatwright would return after starting 32 of 34 games, averaging double-digit scoring, and tying a team-high 60 3-point shots made one year ago.
A 6-foot-10-inch big man who stretches the floor and makes shots from upwards of 23 feet, Boatwright causes a match-up problem for all opposition. In the preseason he was named one of 20 players nationally to watch for the 2017 Karl Malone Award for the best power forward in Division I men’s basketball. However, two injuries have kept him off the court for most of this season.
 First, he missed two games as he nursed a hamstring injury that pestered his offseason.
“It was tough working back,” Boatwright said before his mid-November debut. “But I feel like I’m a better player because of it.”
At the time, Boatwright had no idea that he would play only four full games before an MCL sprain last November would have him sidelined for another two months.
Boatwright finally returned this weekend, several weeks later than his initial prognosis suggested. His time away from the game not only pained him, but it also provided him an opportunity for growth. He’s been itching to return to action for weeks.
“I’ve never been through something like that. I really love the game of basketball. I eat, sleep and live basketball,” Boatwright said after Monday’s practice. “I’ve learned a lot about patience these past weeks.”
Yet, even in his absence, Boatwright has remained a presence on the team by serving as a mentor to the freshmen.
“Just keep fighting” was his motto for the younger players — all of whom are always eager to listen and work hard, he claims.
“He’s really helped us a lot,” freshman guard De’Anthony Melton said, “but not having him was huge for our development … especially having to play crunchtime minutes without him.”
Although Boatwright has returned, Melton has retained his starting role — one he might not have earned this season had the sophomore remained healthy.
“It’s nice to have these freshman develop quickly,” Enfield said. “With Bennie in the lineup, they probably would not have played as many minutes, but they did a good job taking advantage of the opportunity.”
Boatwright, of course, made a tremendous impact in his return last weekend, tying his career-high 23 points at Washington, despite not feeling at his best with “heavy legs.”
Enfield believes USC looks like a different team with his top-scorer in the lineup. In seven games with Boatwright, the Trojans have averaged 82.5 points, five more than in the 17 games without him.
Known for his 3-point prowess, Boatwright adds a lot to this team on both ends of the court. In fact, with Boatwright’s 6-foot-10 frame in the post, Enfield can effectively mix up his defensive schemes.
Lately, he’s been mostly limited to zone because of the team’s diminutive size in the post with junior Elijah Stewart, listed at 6-foot-5, starting at the
four-position. Last weekend, however, USC played a lot of man-to-man with Boatwright on the court and zone defense with him on the bench.
“I try to guard bigger guys and stay in front of smaller guys,” Boatwright said. “I just try to work hard.”
He also passes incredibly well to both his big and small teammates. He had seven assists in his weekend return including a couple alley-oop lobs to fellow big man, sophomore Chimezie Metu.
“It’s really fun to be playing with him again,” Metu said. “We’re clicking. We’re rolling right now.”
Boatwright and Metu have synergy. 
“[Metu’s] my boy,” Boatwright laughed. “I’ll throw it up to him. He’ll kick it out to me. We got that two-man game.” 
Although they have not played much together this season, Metu and Boatwright played all summer long on the same Drew League team. They immediately fell back in stride this past weekend, combining for 80 points, 25 rebounds and 12 assists. 
Chimezie and Bennie add energy to the whole team, junior co-captain Jordan Mclaughlin said. “They know where each other is going to be on the floor at all times, and they’re both great passers,” McLaughlin said. “They get everyone going.”
This week, the Trojans get going with their second round of Pac-12 opponents. They have faced every team once, and now they will face seven teams once more. This time with Bennie Boatwright.
 With the postseason looming one month away from Wednesday, Boatwright returned not a moment too soon. While the freshmen have developed more than Enfield anticipated, Boatwright must be the star if USC makes a run in March.

Katie Chin | Daily TrojanSet up for success · Junior Gert Lisha sets the ball to teammate sophomore Matt Douglas. The team will take on BYU on Friday.
After an upset victory over UCI last week, the men’s volleyball team will have to find that same perseverance, strength and even more in order to defeat nationally ranked No. 3 BYU on Friday. Having No. 6 UCI beat BYU earlier this season, though, the Trojans are focusing less on their ranking and more on how they can win.
“It is the transitive property of competition, if you will,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said. “Irvine beat BYU, we play BYU, but we beat Irvine. It is not inconceivable that we go compete. What we learned from [last] week is that we can go toe-to-toe with a pretty tall, physical, jumping team and that we can just keep on competing.”
The competition will be fierce, as part of the Cougars’ main strength is in their experienced and consistent players. Senior outside hitter Jake Langlois and junior opposite Ben Patch have been putting up the numbers for BYU in both kills and blocks all season long. With these two players leading the way in both the attack and the defense, they will be difficult to beat.
“The more mature you are,” Nygaard said, “the more experience you have, the more comfortable you are in your own skin and the more comfortable you are with whatever is thrown your way.”
USC has experienced players of their own to compete with BYU’s, though, like national kills leader and senior outside hitter Lucas Yoder. His consistency in making plays from one of the two outsider hitter positions on the court has been proven game after game. If Yoder continues at his standard of play and the rest of the team steps up, the game will be theirs for the taking..
“If they pass great, the advantage is definitely on their side of the net simply by virtue that they have a strong attacker in every position,” Nygaard said. “If we can consistently put them in trouble and then be really disciplined on our side and take care of every single ball that we have an opportunity for and then try to transition score at a high rate, we have good opportunities.”
With a full week of practice with no other games, the Trojans have had the time to study BYU in depth, which is not always possible with the way the schedule works out. They understand,  though, that what they have been doing for some games might not work against BYU, and they are not shying away from developing new things to take this team on.
“If you go in expecting that all your old patterns will be successful and you go in and do your patterns and they are not successful, you have a choice,” Nygaard said. “You can grow and learn and develop something new or keep doing the same thing. If you watch film and develop other opportunities for yourself, you can have a lot of success.”
No matter what preparation goes into a game, the game itself can throw unexpected challenges, and it is up to the teams to let those challenges rule them or to rise to conquer them. It could just come down to who wants it more and who is willing to persevere until the end. If that is the case, USC is ready to put in the effort for a victory.
“We are going to have to work hard and earn it,” Nygaard said. “But there has been a lot of people that have gone up and done some good things against that team.”
The Trojans will take on the Cougars on Friday at the Galen Center at 7 p.m.


Hey Erin, what about the horrendous loss to UCSD after upsetting UCI? The headline is misleading .
What does it  take for the students covering the sports to ever respond and admit or correct their
mistakes in articles that have some lame comment time after time.?

After completing their first road sweep in the Enfield era last weekend in Washington, the Trojans (20-4, 7-4) return home to begin their second go-around of Pac-12 play this week against Oregon State. Their seven remaining games include a stretch of three consecutive bouts versus top-10 opponents: No. 5 Oregon, at No. 10 UCLA and then at No. 9 Arizona. But first, the Trojans rematch with Oregon State University (4-20, 0-11) on Thursday night, only a month and a half after beating the Beavers by a final score of 70-63.
The Trojans led that game by 17 at half but failed to put it out of reach until the final minutes. Their victory initiated an 11-game skid for OSU.
Only a year ago, the Beavers secured a seven-seed in the NCAA Tournament on the back of standout senior Gary Payton II. Both the Beavers and the Trojans finished conference play at .500, but this year the teams have divergent fates. 
While the Beavers seek their first conference win of 2016-2017, the Trojans work toward their fifth-straight win. 
“The Pac-12 is great this year,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “We don’t take anything for granted. Our next game is against Oregon State. We’re focused on that and that only.” 
On the season the Beavers have four double-digit scorers, but only two of them, sophomore guard Stephen Thompson Jr. and forward Tres Tinkle, have averaged double figures in conference play. Granted, they average 35.5 points between them.
On the other hand, USC has no clear top scorer, though Enfield suspects sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright can fill that role. Nevertheless, the Trojans have won many games by feeding the hot hand, supporting breakout performances such as freshman guard Jonah Mathew’s 26 points versus Wyoming, sophomore transfer guard Shaqquan Aaron’s 23 versus UCLA and sophomore forward Chimezie Metu’s 29 at Washington State.
“Our offense has never really been around one person,” junior co-captain Jordan McLaughlin said. “It’s good for us that everybody can score at all times. If [the game] comes down the stretch, whoever has the hot hand can make our last shot.”
Freshman guard De’Anthony Melton agreed.
“I don’t think it really matters who starts the game,” Melton said. “Whoever comes to play that game gets to end the game, and we just feed off that.” 
Melton has developed as a scorer this season because the coaching staff has given him the greenlight to shoot. This past weekend he tied his career high 16 points at Washington.
“The coaches have really trusted me with shooting the ball, so as long as I keep making the open shot … that’s the biggest thing for my development,” Melton said. “[Assistant coach] Tony Bland has often told me to take the open shot and take good shots, so that’s what I try to do.” 
The second time through the Pac-12, Melton thinks the team needs to improve its closing out games — something, of course, it struggled to do versus Oregon State.
With the addition of Boatwright, an increased depth in the bench will help the Trojans to remain strong throughout the second half. But Melton believes that effort must come on both sides of the ball.
“In the first half, we lost some tough ones,” Melton said. ”We have to clamp down on defense and take more pride in it.”
The game tips off at 8 p.m. on Thursday night at the Galen Center.

Men’s basketball welcomes the Oregon schools to Los Angeles this week riding a four-game winning run. Though the Beavers and No. 5 Ducks will aim to snap it in the coming days, the Trojans’ current three-week streak has impressed me even more than their 14 consecutive victories to open the season: USC could have easily compiled a losing record from its games against Arizona State, UCLA, Washington and Washington State. The Bruins were a heavy favorite before getting upset at the Galen Center, and USC has struggled away from home under head coach Andy Enfield (13-28 since the 2013-2014 season). Yet the Trojans came away with wins in all of those games, perhaps putting the rest of the nation on notice in the process.
But victories over the unranked Washington teams may not be enough to convince everyone that the USC team that showed up against UCLA was for real; after all, the Trojans have also gotten resoundingly thumped at Oregon and Utah. That makes this weekend massive for Enfield’s squad. A win over the Beavers is a must, but Oregon’s visit on Saturday is an opportunity. Last year’s Trojan side stumbled across the finish line, going 4-of-7 in the final month of the season, and they paid the price in the NCAA tournament, dropping to a No. 8 seed, getting matched up with a Kris Dunn-led Providence team and exiting in the first round. In truth, it likely wouldn’t have mattered much anyway, as No. 1 seed and eventual finalists North Carolina breezed past the Friars two days later — but it was a bitter pill to swallow nonetheless.
If history isn’t to repeat itself, USC needs to carve out an easier path for itself in March Madness, and that starts with a strong finish to the regular season. Another top-10 upset at home would be one heck of a resume builder. But more importantly, the Trojans run the gantlet after Oregon, playing three straight games on the road against No. 9 UCLA, No. 10 Arizona and Arizona State. Almost any team in the country might expect to go 1-2 against those teams, if not worse, which means a loss to the Ducks on Saturday could send USC into a tailspin heading into postseason play. A win, on the other hand, might just give the team key momentum to pull a surprise or two during its road trip.
It isn’t easy beating Oregon, though. Enfield has actually never triumphed over the Ducks since taking the reins at USC — even within the friendly confines of the Galen Center (where Enfield owns a 43-20 record). Having said that, there is buzz surrounding his program that the Trojans may finally be ready to make the leap to national relevance. What better way to announce their arrival than by finally edging fifth-ranked Oregon?
From this perspective, sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright’s return from long-term knee injury couldn’t have come at a better time for the Trojans. Boatwright is arguably his team’s biggest offensive asset, but his size also gives USC’s undersized defense a boost, as evidenced by his seven rebounds at Washington State. This also takes some pressure off sophomore forward Chimezie Metu, who had spent long stretches as the Trojans’ sole big man on the floor during Boatwright’s absence. With a large contingent of USC’s roster playing its first season with the Trojans, there may have been concerns about how smoothly Boatwright would reenter his new-look team, but his career-high scoring night off the bench last week emphatically put such doubts to rest. It’s tough to say whether or not his recovery will be enough to push the squad past an Oregon side that beat USC by 23 points in Eugene earlier this season, but we’ll know the answer soon enough.
Perhaps it was a little presumptuous to call Saturday’s game an opportunity; it could also be a precarious tipping point for a still-developing USC team. But a win over the Ducks would firmly establish the Trojans on the national radar. You simply couldn’t ignore them if they claimed the scalps of two of the top three teams in the Pac-12 standings. A strong follow-up road trip would be a bonus but not necessary; USC would already be cemented as a leading conference team.
All things considered, however, the Trojans would do well to ignore me and not put the cart ahead of the wagon. At the end of the day, even an upset on Saturday would be for naught if Enfield’s squad can’t take care of business tonight against Oregon State. The beaver hunt comes first — then we can move on to the Ducks.

I recently visited the Museum of Contemporary Art in downtown Los Angeles and found myself, I confess, utterly baffled. The other museum-goers, dressed head-to-toe in black and clutching Moleskine notebooks, stood next to me and observed the same installations as I did, but would nod sagely and make remarks like “Crushed soda cans to critique of capitalism” and “This lone blue streak, so suggestive of a tortured mind.” I felt as if I had entered a massive inside joke where everyone was privy to the punchline except me. Did they truly see something that I did not, or were they as mystified as I, only better at hiding it? 
I believe it is the latter. Here are three reasons why modern art cannot be considered true art, on par with the works of genuine geniuses. 
Leonardo da Vinci’s scribble on a paper napkin will fetch billions of dollars simply because it’s a scribble by Leonardo da Vinci. In the same vein, the work of a contemporary artist who is “established” will sell, no matter how outlandish and ridiculous it is. Take, for example, Jeff Koons’ “Balloon Dog,” which fetched a staggering $58.4 million. Fact: If an artist of lesser prominence had created the exact same orange chrome sculpture, it would not rake in such a hefty sum, I assure you. The difference between Koons and da Vinci is that Koons consciously produced a sculpture with the intent of calling it art and expecting it to pay his bills, while da Vinci had no intention of auctioning off his stray pencil marks at a ridiculous price by the grace of his reputation. 
Why are the classical paintings considered to be so? Because it is immediately evident to the viewer that they are drenched in the blood, sweat and tears of the artist. Each brushstroke is an exercise in patience, and a single painting can take months, even years to complete.  Whereas modern art, well, one could dash off five completed works per day, if all it takes is splattering paint around a canvas (cough Pollock cough). A couple centuries from now, I doubt a silkscreen print of Marilyn Monroe will be hanging next to Monet’s Water Lilies. The detail, the thought, the quality of each is simply incomparable.
Modern artists are looking for shock value, nothing more. They want to inspire “thought,” which is such a vague and ephemeral term — what even is “thought”? The creators can argue all they want about the significance of negative space and the depth of feeling behind tri-colored squares, but absolutely no one is taken in except aging billionaires looking to feel “trendy” and “current.” Real paintings elicit emotional responses; the viewer can connect with the images in front of them. Something twinges in their chest. That’s because the classical painters painted with the audience in mind, wanting to send a message with their work. Modern artists don’t give a damn about spectators. They’re absolutely elitist, in that they cater towards academics and like-minded creators, not the general public. Modern art has become so far removed from the masses. Why don’t people visit museums anymore? Because why would they want to spend a day feeling like an idiot?
Real art is evocative and thought-provoking. It can inspire feelings of awe, wonder, reverence. There’s nothing captivating about a pile of bricks or a canvas splashed with paint. Perhaps it is “creative,” but the creativity is misplaced and could be channeled into so many other, worthier pursuits. Classical art and the modern art installations I witnessed operate on such different planes that they cannot both fall under the category of “art.” One is art, and one is pretention to the highest degree. 
Your comment about art being removed from the general public is quite right. Most people could not tell one who is the latest and greatest artist currently, nor would they recognize excrement in a can or a messed up bed as art or anything creative, for that matter. I remember taking a course at a college–I have a degree in art, bytheway–just for the discipline and to be around people, when we all went to a museum for some forgotten reason. We were met by a museum curator and treated like children at the zoo. This curator had all the spiel worked out and declared that we must read about a work so we would know what it meant. We were not only talked down to, but also humiliated as if we were ignorant savages. I felt like a political prisoner facing reindoctrination. This museum had some wonderful works by Gilbert Stuart, Audubon, Ryder and others who she referred to derisively. At any rate, this visit seemed to sum up all that was wrong with art today.

Last summer, I had the chance to visit Marrakech, Morocco. Because of my responsibilities as a student, I could only visit in June. While I was excited to explore this land filled with adventures, I was also concerned. 
Why worry, you ask? Other than the extreme heat that summer in the Sahara would entail, June 2016 also marked Ramadan.
For those who are not familiar with it, Ramadan is a month where the Muslim community fasts from sunrise to sunset. This means no food and no drink at all, excepting children, pregnant women, the sick, the elderly, and those who are traveling. It is a month to seek and give forgiveness, to distance oneself from worldly pleasures and a time to celebrate with loved ones. After sunset, the first meal of the day is called iftar.

Ramadan back home in Indonesia means public places are closed, people stay in and streets are empty. I found myself asking, “If I go, will I travel all the way to Morocco just to marvel over the inside of my hotel room?”
I decided to go anyway. It is, after all, a popular tourist destination and my Moroccan friends encouraged me to see it for myself. I couldn’t help doubting their words, but decided to trust them anyway. I’m glad I did, because it was one magical experience. Sure, some things changed because of the holiday but the challenge only made the experience more rewarding.
Shops, museums, and restaurants were open, but the hours changed. I embarked on an adventure with the receptionist in my hotel to find out what the new hours were. We called the Majorelle Garden – good, they were open. Next destination, Ksar Ait-Ben-Haddou in Ouarzazate, near the Sahara – tours were still accepting visitors. Bahia Palace was only open for four hours during the day, but right outside was a maze of souks that took hours to explore…after a harsh denial to enter the palace, a taxi driver was kind enough to show me some of his favorite places at no extra cost.
At night, the city came alive and became a dream world of songs, food, laughter and lights flickering off stars and lamps like fireflies. Festivities erupted at the Jemaa El-Fnaa main square well into the morning. The experience was different every day. It was addictive. I returned every night to the square and hoped with all my heart that I could bottle up the memory and keep it forever in the back of my mind, to be reviewed on quiet nights and lazy early mornings.
Alysta Lim | Daily Trojan
It was at this time that I got to witness firsthand how the human mind triumphs time and time again over the constraints of the body. It was at this time that I found how capable of kindness we are, if we only try.
Daylight in Marrakech at this time was fifteen hours but not one person complained. The driver on our Sahara tour drove up to eight hours per day in the scorching heat of the desert. When we asked how he could survive without water and food for so long, he simply shrugged and said that he was used to fasting. After all, he had to work, he said, to support his wife and three children in the city.
Shop owners would offer me drinks as a symbol of their hospitality. It didn’t matter that they couldn’t drink with me. A man who tended a spices shop insisted that I try out his mother’s tea, which he claimed was the best in all of Marrakech (she added some secret spices with the mint). It was a little watery and by no means extraordinary but his fervor to be kind warmed my heart.
One night at the Jemaa El-Fnaa main square, a man started shouting at a little boy. I thought he was angry because the boy was staring at the food on his cart. Imagine my surprise when instead of retreating, the boy ran to the man. All turned out well; it turned out the man just wanted to give the boy a piece of bread.
I looked back at the worries that plagued me at the end of my trip. After experiencing Ramadan in Marrakech, such thoughts became inconceivable.
If you find yourself asking, “Should I go?” – I say, go.

Adrian Hernandez | Daily TrojanBa-Dum-Tss · Thornton Professor Peter Erskine is a drummer for over 600 albums and film scores, including La La Land.
Peter Erskine has always marched to the beat of his own drum. 
Erskine, the director of drumset studies and professor practice at the Thornton School of Music, has over two dozen albums to his name and has also appeared in over 600 albums and film scores, including the Oscar-nominated musical La La Land. In December, Erskine’s illustrious career as a composer, performer and author was supplemented with a ninth Grammy nomination. 
 After two past Grammy wins, Erskine’s independently produced album, Dr. Um, was selected as one of five nominations out of nearly 800 submissions under the category of Best Jazz Instrumental Album. The title, a pun for drum, was conceptualized by Erskine’s friend, director Jack Fletcher, who encouraged Erskine to assume the alter ego name Dr. Um and create the record.
 In his youth, Erskine was branded as a hard-hitting player, but the making of Dr. Um evidenced a unique break from his former musical style. 
“I was best known for being a muscular, [loud] player, but then I went in a totally opposite direction for a few years,”Erskine said. “[I] dedicated myself to trying to learn how to play not only softly but to create the same kinds of musical peaks and valleys in a soft, disciplined realm,.
Erskine described his penchant for music, and in particular, the drums.
“[Playing softly] requires a singularly dedicated approach, a specific approach that I wanted to make because I was fascinated by ways of creating different kinds of surface tension within the music. People began to think of me as a sensitive player.”
The tender tone of the album reflects a harking back to past styles, techniques or chapters of Erskine’s musical life.
“The theme became ‘The Lost Pages’ — music that deserved another chance, music that hadn’t been heard or noticed the first time around,” Erskine said. “This album was a chance for me to revisit some music and musical styles that I’d left behind. [It’s music I would’ve played] if I’d known then what I know now.” 
Dr. Um features tracks of Erskine’s own composition, collaborations with John Beasley, Bob Sheppard and Janek Gwizdala, songs from his old band Weather Report and even pieces by Gustav Mahler. In essence, Dr. Um became a highly personalized collection of music Erskine was passionate about making his own and immortalizing.
Rather than acquiesce to corporate hurdles, Erskine launched his own record label based in Santa Monica — Fuzzy Music, inspired by a book about fuzzy logic — with his wife, over 20 years ago. He referred to the production of Dr. Um as a “kitchen tabletop operation,” as he and his wife manually packaged and distributed albums for sale from their home. 
“I think my nomination signals that the age of artist-owned label has arrived. [Fuzzy Music] represented a means by which I could get music recorded that I wanted recorded,” Erskine said. “It’s still important to make music in the studio — it’s different from playing your own music or playing in a club because it’s there for all time.”
On all past nominations, Erskine collaborated with groups of other jazz musicians, including fellow Thornton faculty members pianist Alan Pasqua and Jazz Department Chair Bob Mintzer, who was also nominated for a Grammy in the Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album category for his album All L.A. Band, which was also produced by Erskine’s Fuzzy Music label.
“This [nomination] is the most exciting. It’s the first time I’ve been nominated purely as a solo artist; everything before has been a collaborative effort,” Erskine said. “For that reason, and also for the label having two albums nominated, [this year’s Grammys] is great fun.” 
When it comes to his influence at Thornton, Erskine regards teaching music, especially in the realm of jazz, as the natural next step for his professional pursuits.
“I think most teachers would recognize the simple truth that part of the reason we like to teach is we end up learning more than the students. USC is a tremendous magnet for great, young, talented musicians,” Erskine said. “There’s something about the sense of community here, the ecosystem, that’s special. I love being inspired by the challenge the students present.”

When American high schools formed their first jazz bands in the 1940s and 1950s, they shunned the word jazz. At that time, jazz connoted all manner of debauchery: It was dance music, black music and low art. Etymologists speculate that the word’s original meaning is sexual, deriving from the same source as “jizz” or “Jezebel” (meaning prostitute). 
Though jazz stood as total anathema to all of the musical values the classical tradition upheld, educators knew the sound of jazz had captured the interest of their students. So, they grafted a rhythm section onto groups of trumpets, trombones and saxes — the unmistakable instrumentation of a jazz big band — and gave it a sanitized, Uncle Sam-approved name: the stage band.
Stage bands could only fly under the radar for so long before the gatekeepers of music education came after them. A 1964 article in the Music Educators Journal lamented the rise of stage bands in public schools, roaring: “The paralogical reasoning that has directed this surrender to the meretricious has its basis in a deplorable misconception of the function and responsibility of the school and the music teacher. A school is not, nor was it ever intended to be, a place to which parents send their children to be entertained.”
But jazz survived. Eventually, it managed to shed its licentious baggage, and rather than abandoning their stage bands, schools began to restyle them as jazz bands and celebrate jazz for its unique heritage.
Like Rorschach’s impressionable inkblot, jazz means something different for everyone. Jazz isn’t considered smut anymore. But we have a new problem: It’s seen as pretentious and boring. How is it that jazz, a great American art form, has been misunderstood yet again?
Enter Ryan Gosling. For a movie about a jazz snob and a jazz hater falling in love, La La Land has been nothing if not divisive. As if music fans didn’t do enough to discourage Damien Chazelle after 2014’s Whiplash, the director has returned with yet another film about a young, white jazz musician enslaved by his obsession with an ill-defined notion of musical integrity.
La La Land has a lot going for it: an engaging plot, heartfelt performances by all the actors and mouth-watering cityscapes of Los Angeles (there’s nothing Angelenos love more than a wintertime kiss with the crown of the U.S. Bank Tower standing in for mistletoe). But as countless writers have reminded us the past few weeks, the movie suffers the same critical failure as Whiplash — it simply doesn’t get jazz.
“It’s hard not to detect a whiff of ideological snobbery to La La Land. The movie will undoubtedly continue to rack up awards, and introduce newer generations to jazz,” music journalist Seve Chambers wrote in a Vulture article. ”It’s just unfortunate that, as parts of the jazz world have finally ditched rigid definitions of what the genre should be, the conservative vision is now being pushed to global audiences again.”
“The conservative vision” that Chambers mentions refers to the notion of jazz that Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) espouses throughout the movie: Traditional jazz is the only pure jazz. In La La Land, Mia (Emma Stone) hates jazz, but it’s not her fault. It’s because she hasn’t heard the right stuff. She’s heard sellout jazz, jazz with such fearsome appellations as smooth and fusion.
That’s until one day, when Sebastian, our white savior, swoops Mia up from her barista job and takes her to a real jazz club, where she can hear real jazz: jazz with intensity, conflict and passion. Suddenly, Mia gets it. And only a few scenes later, as Sebastian plays a gig at the same club, she dances along in ecstasy, complete with jazz hands and finger snapping.
Jazz musicians have been subjected to these tired clichés time after time, to the point that it’s become a classic joke to reflexively hate jazz, as a recent Slate article observed. “I’ve met a few musicians who could be caricatured into Sebastian,” Ratliff concluded. “It would be a drag if he became as real and commonplace as the joke about hating jazz.”
The implication is that bad portrayals of jazz are offending the narrow preferences of working musicians. Perhaps the backlash that La La Land has received from the jazz community confirms that it’s pointless to try to satisfy the pretenses of avowed jazz fans. Because music is all about fun, right? Reasoning along these lines, fans came to the movie’s defense: “Let’s start the La La Land backlash backlash,” one wrote.
In this fray of lashing and backing, there’s one point on which the movie, the backlashers and the back-backlashers all seem to converge: All sound different echoes of Sebastian’s fearful observation from early in the film — “jazz is dying on the vine.”
The question is who’s killing it. In the movie, it’s Keith (John Legend), who wants to fuse jazz with EDM so that young people will listen to it. For the critics, it’s Chazelle, who already made it big by misrepresenting jazz in Whiplash and should quit while he’s ahead. And for the ardent fans coming to La La Land’s defense, it’s the critics, who should be grateful that jazz is getting any screen time at all.
What La La Land and its attendant pundits really show us is that jazz takes abuse from all sides — the haters, the traditionalists and the revolutionaries alike. But here’s the thing: Jazz can take it. Jazz has been misunderstood as many times as it’s been mentioned, and it’s always weathered the storm.
That’s because jazz is bigger — and stronger — than what La La Land makes it out to be. The movie’s plot requires jazz music to be pathetic. Sebastian’s cloying obsession with jazz (he worships a discarded stool from The Baked Potato because Hoagy Carmichael once sat on it) isn’t romantic and quaint unless jazz is the dying art he calls it.
But jazz is thriving, not only among introverted white guys at their pianos, but also in ubiquity. It’s just a matter of moving beyond Sebastian’s narrow notion of what real jazz is. Kendrick Lamar rapped over the Robert Glasper Trio playing killer modal jazz in “For Free.” Snarky Puppy’s house party concerts have earned them a devoted following of non-jazz fans. Then there’s pop trio Dirty Loops and their viral covers of hits like “Rolling in the Deep.”
Those examples sound nothing like the big bands of the swing era or the dogfighting combo jazz Sebastian fawns over. But that’s the point. For the same reason nobody contends that Lady Gaga isn’t an important pop star because of her classical piano background, today’s jazz artists who dabble in other genres deserve to be called innovators, not sellouts. Indeed, jazz was born at the intersection of blues, gospel and marching band traditions. It’s always been a pidgin music. 
That jazz artists are exploring new sonic territories in their music rather than retreating to the safe idioms of bebop and swing shows that jazz is growing, if in depth rather than reach. Hopefully, the watered-down renditions of jazz offered by films like La La Land will inspire fans to seek out the real thing.
Jazz survived racial segregation and being called vulgar. It has survived numerous pronunciations of its death. Surely, it can survive a skirmish over a Hollywood musical that isn’t really about music.

When Taylor Swift’s 1989 won Album of the Year at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards, I was livid.  Despite being the first time I had ever seen the Grammys live on TV, I felt personally cheated, and part of me is still a little peeved about it.
To Pimp a Butterfly is a modern masterpiece that’s socially poignant and conscious. It is an important album to have amid the recent rise of racial tensions after the killings of Tamir Rice, Michael Brown and Eric Garner. This album was important for not only the black community but also America as a whole, and it gave a voice to the historically disenfranchised in the 21st century. It was also Kendrick Lamar’s best work to date, complete with an exploration of contemporary sounds of funk, jazz and hip hop, which created something that had never been done before.
In other words, I was mad when Swift won because Lamar deserved it more. And all credit to Taylor Swift — the snake that she is — she made a great album. With seven singles off of a single record, 1989 is an absolute powerhouse of a pop record. And while her awful acceptance speech that took a shot at Kanye West sparked one of the greatest exposés I will ever see in my lifetime, I would have preferred to see Lamar take the stage and accept the award.
Chances are, he won’t be the only artist I sympathize with for getting snubbed for an award. That’s why it’s important to take a step back and think what the Grammys really mean. To me, they’re not exactly popularity contests, but popularity definitely plays a major role in determining who wins a Grammy.
Did Taylor Swift truly put out the best album of the year in 2015? Probably not. 
But did she put out one of the most popular albums of the year? Yes. 
And that’s an undeniable measure of success. While Taylor sits in her snake hole watching the sales from 1989 pile up, her songs from the album are starting to become old news. Same with Ariana Grande and her album Dangerous Woman, which is nominated for Best Pop Album. It’s a great album that is true to Grande’s style and character, but in a couple of years, it’ll be old news. An album like Purpose by Justin Bieber, which is also nominated for the same award, is not only a great pop album, but it’s also the result of an artist trying to change their image, sound and outlook on their craft. I hope it will win, but I’ve been disappointed before. 
This happens all the time with the Grammys. In 1992, Nirvana was snubbed for Best Rock Song by an unplugged version of Eric Clapton’s “Layla.” This is about as atrocious as it can get, aside from the whole Metallica incident. You know what song helped to launch the grunge movement of the ’90s and inspired an entire generation of rock? I’ll give you a hint — it’s not the unplugged version of “Layla.”
In true tradition of the Grammys, there are plenty of snubs to go around with this year’s nominations. Solange was snubbed for an Album of the Year nomination, though her album received rave reviews comparable to her sister’s. Also, I understand that the competition is stiff for this category, but how did David Bowie not get a nod? I can count on one hand the amount of artists who have had a final album like Blackstar. 
There’s never a great answer why these atrocities happen. But I like to think that the people who are responsible for determining award winners are also humans who make mistakes from time to time. I’ll be furious, but I’ll also understand if Views trumps Blank Face LP or The Life of Pablo for Best Rap Album this year. I’ll understand that the critics who made this decision bought into the popularity, as we all do from time to time, without really giving the category much consideration. That, or they don’t know what the hell they’re doing. 
The underlying question now is: How much value does a Grammy really have these days? Nicki Minaj still hasn’t won a Grammy, but did that ever stop her from selling millions of records? You can make the argument that a Grammy represents the reward of the hard work an artist put in to shape a work of art that matched their vision for a creative project, but you can also argue that it’s a trophy to be put on a mantle: nothing more, nothing less.
The late Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest once said in “Award Tour,” “I never let a statue tell me how nice I am.” He doesn’t need awards to validate his status as an artist, and he has a point; if you let awards dictate your success as an artist, you’re in the wrong business. That being said, getting some recognition for the hard work you do wouldn’t hurt now and then.
Regardless, award shows should not be taken that seriously. A trophy is never the end-all-be-all when it comes to determining who the best of the best is in music. I’m not going to suddenly change my opinion of an album like To Pimp a Butterfly overnight because it didn’t win a Grammy, nor am I going to change my opinion on an album like 1989 because it did win one.
I am, however, going to think that a year like 2015 was a great year for music, and even though the artist I wanted to win didn’t end up bringing home the gold, I can still recognize that listeners have a wide variety of great music to listen to. That’s never a bad thing. But, I’ll still be waiting for the results to come on Sunday because at the end of the day, every artist deserves to be celebrated for their work.

Thursday marks the final day of voting for Undergraduate Student Government candidates. Looking back on the election cycle as students cast their last ballots, the campaign process has been filled with intense vitriol, especially in the face of accusations made by the tickets against one another.
At the beginning of the semester, for our first editorial board, we vowed to hold the institutions on our campus accountable. USG is, of course, not excused from this process. We are committed to identifying how the organization can better serve students. This task includes endorsing the candidates we see most fit to lead the student body. It also includes providing information that students need to learn about their representatives. Readers should recognize our role in providing USG and other organizations with checks and balances.
That’s exactly what newspapers around the country are trying to accomplish on a national scale right now. But we have been caught in a media frenzy — and because of the rise of fake and sensationalist news, readers are debasing the work and legitimacy of credible newspapers. Many people don’t know what fair and balanced reporting looks like anymore, and it has become easy to succumb to groupthink in calling out the media as corrupt and unethical. 
As USC’s sole campus newspaper, the Daily Trojan recognizes the responsibility to inform its readers, made up mostly of students, about USG elections. We produced a USG elections supplement, including a voter’s guide, in an effort to spotlight why civic engagement is so important and to educate readers about the meaningful role of student government at USC. This is because, as close followers of USG, we are dedicated to reporting the facts so that students know what their leaders are doing and can hold them accountable.
In the supplement, the editorial board officially endorsed the ticket we saw most fit to lead the highest student office at USC after interviewing each ticket and independently evaluating them. Our paper also covered the sanctions of the Austin-Morgan ticket because as a campus newspaper, we have a responsibility to report newsworthy campus events — but also because students deserve to make informed decisions as they cast their votes. 
In response to our election coverage, some members of the student body have labeled the Daily Trojan as “biased” — an accusation that deeply disturbs us as editors of this publication. Moreover, readers have alleged that the Daily Trojan is trying to sway the elections or mislead voters.
Far from it, the Daily Trojan is dedicated to providing balanced coverage. In writing the stories about the sanctions imposed on the Austin-Morgan campaign, our publication spoke to all parties involved. We ensured, to the best of our abilities, that all candidates had a voice in our reporting. This practice is a pillar of good journalism and one that the Daily Trojan strives to meet.
All the while, we will not be deterred by criticism. At a time when reputable news organizations have come under attack by the highest office in the land, we will defend ourselves against accusations of media bias and irresponsible reporting. In addition, we encourage our readers to also uphold their commitment to fair and unbiased reporting. We hope readers will avoid giving in to the national mass hysteria around journalistic balance, and instead individually evaluate whether the sources are fair instead of jumping on a “biased media” bandwagon that is all too easy to join but is also ultimately unproductive.

On Monday, gender studies lecturer Heather Berg hosted a talk in Taper Hall on sex work, a profession mired in controversy. Berg presented the field through an objectively economic lens — a consensual exchange of goods that is perhaps disproportionately stigmatized by men in positions of lawmaking power and is too often falsely equated with rightfully illegal sex trafficking. 
In her lecture, Berg discussed how sex workers’ wages are shrinking and their labor is becoming increasingly demanding and unsafe. Bans on sex work merely amount to bans on safe sex work. Ultimately, only through legal recognition of their work can their human rights be respected.
The profession is far more pervasive than most would believe. Porn quietly dominates the internet; a strip club operates on street corners all over Los Angeles; and, all too relevant, cases like that of  the Duke University student who famously paid her tuition through sex work, are not as uncommon as many believe. 
I was unsettled by just how fringe Berg’s points sounded. With sex work as prevalent as it is, why was a discussion of sex workers’ economic, labor and human rights taking place in a room in Taper Hall rather than CNN?
Scrolling through my Twitter feed that evening, I found my answer in an article by the U.K. newspaper, The Sun, entitled “Playboy model Simone Holtznagel strips naked for ‘Free The Nipple’ campaign during X-rated girls’ night out,” reporting on Holtznagel’s Instagram post voicing opposition to censorship of the female body. The article focused not on her advocacy, but on racy photos and her apparently outrageous behavior. 
Despite sexist simplifications of it, the Free the Nipple movement’s goal is to fight the sexual double standards that objectify and shame women’s bodies, and empower everyday women in a society that seeks to either sexualize or regulate their bodily decisions. Of course a movement meant to desexualize women’s bodies would be hijacked by mainstream media and framed around pornography. And of course, as demonstrated by articles like The Sun’s, advocacy emerging from sex workers and their allies is ignored unless it can somehow be twisted into a means to shame and sexualize women. 
A cursory search of coverage of porn stars and sex workers  by  outlets such as The Sun, Daily Mail and other outlets yields similar results — pieces with nothing to do with sex workers’ demands for labor rights.
We can’t forget that those who make decisions about female sex workers’ rights are often powerful, privileged men. They paternalistically presume to know what’s best for women who either have no other options or simply enjoy their work. These male lawmakers will quip that “women deserve better” while simultaneously being the ones who oppose legislation funding education, job training, welfare and other programs to uplift poor women.
But ultimately, the issue isn’t just that those who make decisions about female sex workers’ rights tend to be privileged men. It’s also that the mainstream media have seized the narrative around sex work from the workers themselves and failed to include their real concerns. 
One popular line of reasoning for why we fail to give sex workers a platform comes from those who claim to be feminists and argue that discussions of sex work disempower women. But frankly, who gets to define empowerment to women without your same economic privilege and access to education, whose sole means of survival are a profession you would rather turn a blind eye to?
Another concern is that openly discussing sex workers’ rights will somehow be purported as condoning violence, abuse and exploitation of women, despite 2015 research compiled by Amnesty International that suggests rates of assault and contracted STIs among sex workers are lower in jurisdictions where the profession is legal, where workers are offered labor rights, recognized as human beings and do not have to hide from law enforcement. 
Ultimately, perhaps it’s the people who equate consensual sex work with the subjugation of women, who refuse to accept that women are capable of making decisions about their bodies and careers, and not sex workers, who are feeding societal oppression of women. The popular notion that women who sell sex are, in the words of former President Jimmy Carter, objects to be “bought and sold,” serves to bind a woman’s whole identity to the mere act of sex, so that she is not merely selling a service but her entire self. 
This narrative is so unsettlingly pervasive that perhaps more than anything else, it explains why sex workers remain removed from the mainstream dialogue around their profession. We don’t offer them a platform to advocate for themselves because we have yet to recognize their humanity. Until we do, they will remain voiceless, their human rights a seemingly fringe topic of college lecture halls.

A lot of good points. But it is difficult to see how government at any level can help sex workers until their work becomes legal. Otherwise, governments might agree that sex workers deserve the same basic benefits as others – but not protection from the hazards of their illegal work, hazards they willingly accept. Legalize prostitution? That would make a big difference, but given the norms of our society, that is a long ways off.

Any time the song “Pumped Up Kicks” by Foster the People is on, I can’t help but add my own twist to the song: “All the other kids with the pumped up lips, better run, better run…”
Who could blame me, especially living in Los Angeles? One simply has to open Instagram to see that it is riddled with posts showing off new contouring skills that complement plastic, puffed lips and implant-induced cheekbones.
But this blog’s purpose does not lie in shaming those who choose to undergo plastic surgery, nor does it aim to condone it. Ultimately, it’s an individual choice and it’s up to the decision maker to determine what is best for them. I certainly know my fair share of people who have decided to go under the knife, and while I enjoyed seeing how happy they were with the results, they were just as beautiful to me after the procedure as they were before.  
My concern lies more with society’s growing plastic surgery obsession and the pressure it puts on individual members to look a certain way. While writing this piece, my friend Maria informed me of a woman at her workplace who told her that she needed lip injections because hers are too thin. Maria, confident and beautiful, laughed as she told me the story.
“My lips are great,” she said loudly. “I’m already beautiful. The woman is crazy!” 
In a perfect world, everybody would be as confident as Maria. For the time being — and probably for as long as humans exist — we are stuck with societal compulsions to turn to procedural (and non-procedural) beauty enhancements. In many ways, it has become a virtue of sorts, with many claiming it helps them feel beautiful.
But why should society make anyone feel ugly in the first place? Everybody wants to feel beautiful — there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, nor with keeping any kind of beauty routine; however, there is something unhealthy about our obsession with it, an obsession so strong that many of us are willing to permanently alter our faces to fit some inflated standard of beauty. While I’ve never gone under the knife, I am certainly also guilty of such vanity and social obedience, as my eyebrow lady can attest to every time I obsessively draw lines for her to prevent the possibility of over-tweezing. 
We all have a right to feel beautiful, but nobody has the right to tell us how or under which circumstances we can feel that way. If you want to get your nose done, go ahead. If you want to get your lips pumped, pump away — just know that you don’t have to in order for society to find you attractive, nor should you feel ugly if you don’t conform to whatever beauty trend is the latest craze. Trends fade (just look at Mona Lisa’s eyebrows), but permanent alterations do not.
Essentially, I guess what I’m saying is, let’s all just take a page out of Maria’s book.

Undergraduate Student Government Senator and presidential candidate Daniel Million resigned from the Senate on Tuesday, citing what he said was a lack of inclusivity from the organization as well as unfair hiring practices and judicial processes.
Million was not present at the USG Senate meeting on Tuesday, though he had not announced his resignation publicly at the time. He explained that the biggest problem that he had with USG was the organization’s inability to make him feel welcome, especially as a student of color.
“In a meeting with some heads of USG, I stated that as one of the two black males of the organization, I sometimes felt like no one cares about the problems I’m facing,” Million said. “I’ve talked about the Black Lives Matter movement and unarmed black people being shot and how that impacts me. No one has listened, I don’t think anyone has cared.”
USG Vice President Austin Dunn, who oversees Senate meetings and has worked with Million in the past year, said that he made efforts to reach out to all senators by scheduling one-on-one meetings with them throughout the year. However, he said that Million never expressed any of the concerns he had about not feeling included in USG to him.
“That’s really hard to hear because there are many people at this organization that are fighting for people of all backgrounds and communities,” Dunn said. “Edwin and I can only control so much, and when people don’t bring issues forward and have a discussion with us, then there’s no way we can help. We can’t be in the minds of other students — all we can do is serve the people who are willing to speak up and have an open dialogue with us about the problems that are being had.”
Furthermore, Million said that he believed the hiring process in USG was tilted in the favor of people who had personal connections to current USG leaders, and that he no longer wanted to be part of an organization that chose its members in this way. If elected president, Million explained that inclusion and a non-biased hiring process would be a primary concern.
“I don’t want anybody to feel the way I did,” Million said. “As a delegate, I felt like I didn’t know people within the organization that were higher up and that I didn’t have a chance. I want every person on this campus to feel like they have an equal opportunity to get positions these positions.”
Dunn, however, explained that for USG appointments, the heads of most branches — communications, funding and program board — are chosen by the previous year’s leaders, a system that he emphasized was based on merit and not personal connections.
“As the vice president, I oversee the advocacy branch and the Senate, and I only directly hire the director of the advocacy branch,” Dunn said. “Experience within the organization, ideas for moving forward and passion are three things that I look for personally.”
While Million said he does “wholeheartedly respect” the work that USG does, especially that of the cultural assemblies, advocacy branch and program board, he explained that his participation in the election has led to his loss of faith in the organization’s ability to uphold rules. His ticket, Million-Vorhoff, filed a complaint against the Austin-Morgan campaign last week, accusing them of beginning their campaign the day before the start of the official campaign period. The Austin-Morgan ticket received four strikes — out of nine that would lead to disqualification — and was stripped of $1,000 out of its $1,500 campaign reimbursement. Million said that this punishment is not adequate and negatively impacts USG’s accountability and integrity.
“I feel like this sets a precedent that students in the future that have the resources to fund their own campaigns might as well seek this unfair advantage,” Million said. “People are going to take advantage of this ability. The members of the organization need to be held to a higher standard.”
However, Dunn said that he agreed with Million’s point, and had actually tried to address the problem himself.
“I was worried about a precedent being set where having money would allow you to break the rules,” Dunn said. “It’s really offensive to apply that to myself and Morgan’s campaign, because the moment I heard about the ruling, I went to the professional staff and asked if I could appeal. I did that because we were honest about the mistake that we made and wanted to be clear that it would never happen again.”
Million explained that despite his resignation, he wants to remain involved with USG by serving as its president, through which he hopes to make a lasting impact on the USC community.
“At the end of the day, what I want to be remembered for, regardless of if we win or lose this election, is that we’re fighting for the students,” Million said. “We want to make sure all the students know what’s going on this campus. We want to give students the opportunity to make an impact.”

On Tuesday evening, students and professors gathered at Ground Zero Performance Café for the “Homelessness in LA: The City of Dreams” event hosted by the USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics. Featuring USC alumnus and County of Los Angeles Supervisor, 2nd District Mark Ridley-Thomas, the talk examined legislation he introduced to address homelessness in Los Angeles County. The event was moderated by journalist Marylouise Oates, who was a former society columnist for the Los Angeles Times.
Ridley-Thomas focused the discussion on his background working with the homeless, both from outside and within the government and the severity of the issue in Los Angeles County. Measure H, which will be on the March 7 ballot, would combat the issue. He said that his call to activism was catalyzed by the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.
“The nation was fundamentally upset,” Ridley-Thomas said. “I was in middle school, then called junior high school and it was hard to escape this powerful, charismatic presence and voice that I heard on the radio and I saw on television. Ever since that night, I’ve been on a journey as a pilgrim or devil’s aide of non violent direct action. His organization is known as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. I ended up being executive director of the SCLC in Los Angeles for the decade prior to my election into public office.”
Oates shared her support for Proposition H and added that there are 46,000 homeless people residing in Los Angeles County. Ridley-Thomas further explained how the proposition would combat this issue.
“We need to get services to individuals who are homeless —those individuals who need substantial mental health services, drug treatment services, rapid re-housing, psychiatric care centers,” Ridley-Thomas said. “These dollars from Measure H go to these services.”
When asked why homelessness is the issue he works to combat, Ridley-Thomas called it the defining civic issue in Los Angeles County. He added that L.A. is the epicenter of homelessness in not only California but in the United States too, as no other region has more homeless individuals.
“It is the most pressing issue of our time, and if we don’t do something about it now we will rue the day we forget to act,” Ridley-Thomas said.
After the initial discussion between Ridley-Thomas and Oates, Unruh associates asked the supervisor questions about the new administration’s effect on homelessness, the housing crisis in L.A. and USC’s role in the issue. Ridley-Thomas called homelessness a non-partisan issue.
“I think it’s really very important to appreciate that whether you’re a Democrat or Republican or anything in between, the homelessness issue transcends the matter of partisanship,” Ridley-Thomas said. “People regardless of their political orientation or their partisan status want this issue addressed.”
Sophie Greensite, a junior majoring in economics and an Unruh Associate at the event, said that everything Ridley-Thomas said struck a chord with her and that this event was different than the typical Tuesday Unruh event.
“This event was especially interesting because it wasn’t a panel — it was just a discussion between Supervisor Ridley-Thomas and Marylouise Oates,” Greensite said. “I was really interested in what the supervisor had to say because he is one of the most powerful men for our county.”
Senior Laura Reilly, who attended the event, is helping to organize USC’s Homelessness Awareness Week, which will take place from Feb. 27 to March 3.
“It’s basically an opportunity to make homelessness a visual issue,” Reilly said. “We’re going to have tents that we put up, panels, speakers, and we’re doing a drive for hygiene kits. It’s basically a way for students to take action and get involved with something they care about.”

A new study led by USC researchers concluded that living in polluted areas increases the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes for overweight Latino children in urban Los Angeles.
Researchers studied over 300 children for an average of 3.4 years, none of whom had Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes prior to the study. The children had annual physicals at USC or at the Los Angeles County hospital, where scientists measured their glucose and insulin levels.
None of the children developed type 2 diabetes after the study concluded. However, once subjects turned 18, they had higher blood insulin levels and many were marked as pre-diabetic.
According to the study, which was published last week in the journal Diabetes, socioeconomic status was also measured for participants. The scientists examined parents’ occupations and ranked their levels of education.
The study noted that the results may only be applicable to the specific group they studied — overweight Latino children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. In the future, researchers plan to broaden the study to participants who are not overweight.
Previous USC researchers have also found a link between air pollution and lung cancer survival time, cognitive impairment for the elderly and dementia in older women.
Bad. I was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes and put on Metformin on June 26th, 2016. I started the ADA diet and followed it 100% for a few weeks and could not get my blood sugar to go below 140. Finally i began to panic and called my doctor, he told me to get used to it. He said I would be on metformin my whole life and eventually insulin. At that point i knew something wasn’t right and began to do a lot of research. On August 13th I found Lisa’s diabetes story (google ” HOW EVER I FREED MYSELF FROM THE DIABETES ” )  I read that article from end to end because everything the writer was saying made absolute sense. I started the diet that day and the next morning my blood sugar was down to 100 and now i have a fasting blood sugar between Mid 70’s and the 80’s. My doctor took me off the metformin after just three week of being on this lifestyle change. I have lost over 30 pounds and 6+ inches around my waist in a month. The truth is we can get off the drugs and help myself by trying natural methods

Coming off of a record-setting 2016 season, the No. 4 USC women’s lacrosse team has high expectations going into its 2017 campaign.
Before being knocked out of the NCAA quarterfinals by Syracuse last year, the Trojans won 16 straight games during the regular season, captured an MPSF championship and became the first-ever West Coast team to host an NCAA tournament game.
Aside from last year’s postseason success, however, USC has the potential to make an NCAA title run with a potent mixture of youth and experience in its newest championship crusade.
Reigning MPSF Coach of the Year Lindsey Munday returns to lead a Trojan team that will play without 2016 MPSF Player of the Year Courtney Tarleton, third-team IWLCA All-American Amanda Johansen and all-league selections Kelsey Dreyer, Kaitlyn Couture and Caroline deLyra.
While defensive dynamo Tarleton (41 ground balls and 52 caused turnovers last season) and offensive guru deLyra (40 goals, 29 assists and 61 shots on goal) will be difficult to replace, Munday has a loaded roster.
USC still has returning key leaders in junior goalie Gussie Johns (19 wins), leading scorer and senior attackers Michaela Michael (68 goals, 31 assists and 107 draw controls) and Kylie Drexel (40 goals, 18 assists and 25 ground balls).
Design by: Michelle Je
Johns, a U.S. National Team netminder, will return to the cage for her third straight season and hopes to build off an NCAA-best 6.04 goals allowed average in 2016.
Assisting Johns in the backfield will be a collection of talented defensive threats such as senior defense Nina Kelty (24 ground balls and 14 caused turnovers) and junior midfield Lydia Sutton (37 ground balls and 28 caused turnovers) who can thwart potential goal scorers.
On defense, the Trojans can also rely on veteran senior Glade Nugent to guide first-year defenders freshman Emily Shields and sophomore Avery Hogarth.
Meanwhile, USC features a wealth of freshmen in its midfield, including Kelly Johansen, Natalie Byrne, Morgan Kuligowski, Kaeli Huff and top national recruit Kerrigan Miller. Along with them, the Trojans will also roster freshman attackers Sarah Larkin and Ashley Hill, who will likely learn a thing or two playing with senior attacker Cynthia Del Core (24 goals and eight assists).
As favorites in the MPSF and NCAA, USC will have to survive a schedule rife with top-30 talent this season. This year, the Trojans will face No. 9 Northwestern (Feb. 18), No. 3 Florida (Feb. 24), No. 22 Dartmouth (March 17), No. 16 Cornell (March 19), No. 5 Stony Brook (March 24), No. 25 Ohio State (March 26), No. 27 Colorado (April 14) and No. 12 Stanford (April 21).
But to start, the team kicks off its 2017 MPSF title defense this Saturday at noon, as the Trojans battle the visiting St. Mary’s College Gaels at McAlister Field.
Along with compiling a 0-14 record in 2016, St. Mary’s lost its lone contest with USC last season 3-20, and the Gaels allowed two hat tricks from senior midfielder Drew Jackson and senior attacker Kylie Drexel.
USC owes much of its success to the leadership of Munday, who enters her fifth season as head coach of the Women of Troy.
For a coach and a program that played its first game a mere five years ago, the only thing better than a 51-26 record is a NCAA title.
Give Coach Monday and her staff pay raises!!!

Whether in person or on paper, it’s hard to tell the difference between USC women’s water polo seniors Stephania and Ioanna Haralabidis.
Both stand tall at 5-foot-11 with long, blonde hair. Both are All-American drivers in the pool for the Trojans, having led USC to an undefeated 2016 season that culminated in the program’s fifth national championship last May. They have the same walk, similar mannerisms and laugh the same way. They also share the same classes, like the same foods and even live together.
All things considered, it’s exactly what you would expect from a pair of identical twin sisters.
Stephania and Ioanna grew up in Greece, swimming and playing on the same water polo team together since the age of 12. But after citing a desire to get accustomed to the American style of water polo, they packed up their things and moved to Orange County, where they attended Corona del Mar High School their senior year.
It was a long journey from Athens to Los Angeles, but it was a decision that has paid off greatly for them and for USC’s storied water polo program.
Now in their final collegiate season, Stephania and Ioanna have racked up numerous individual accolades and continue to climb the ladder in the USC record books. After starting out the season at No. 8 all-time in career scoring, Stephania has jumped all the way up to No. 4 all-time with 221 career goals, while Ioanna, who started at No. 20 all-time, now stands at No. 14 with 141 career goals. The twins currently lead the undefeated Trojans in scoring this season as well, as Stephania is tops on the team with 36 goals, followed by Ioanna with 23 goals.
After 21 years of being attached at the hip, you’d think that the Haralabidis’ would be sick of each other by now. That’s hardly the case. Instead, they’ll tell you that their relationship is as close as it gets.
Design by: Sophia Chen
“We’re best friends. She’s my other half,” Stephania said.
Ioanna agreed, in almost identical fashion.
“I don’t know what I’d do without her,” she said. “She’s my best friend.”
Outside of the pool, the Haralabidises share many other aspects of their lives as well. For example, while Stephania is an international relations major and Ioanna is a communication major, a marketing minor has allowed them to take at least one class with each other every semester since they’ve been at USC. While most twins might look to branch out and explore their individuality as they grow older, sharing their experiences has just become part of the norm for these sisters.
“We love to do things together,” Stephania said.
“We are different people,” Ioanna added. “But we’re so used to being together that it’s just…”
“Natural,” Stephania finished.
The concept of “twin telepathy” is also something that the sisters feel is extremely beneficial to them as teammates.
“We’ve worked together for so long that I know exactly where she wants the ball, when, and how in order for her to score,” Ioanna said.
And while “Jo” may cite herself as the better defender, “Stef” is considered the better scorer. That balance has allowed the two to feed off of each other well in game situations.
“We both have our own strengths,” Stephania said. “But when we combine them together, we make a really strong force and you can see it when we play.”
It’s a unique relationship and a bond that not many others can replicate, and their successes both in and out of the water are a testament to that.
However, that’s not to say that the two always see eye to eye. For example, Stephania isn’t fully convinced that she and her sister are actually identical twins, while Ioanna insists they are. Ioanna also claims that she was born one minute earlier, but Stephania is skeptical about that as well.
“Our mom said it was only 30 seconds, but whatever,” she said.
There’s also plenty of room for a friendly sibling rivalry.
“We do like to get competitive,” Stephania said. “We’ll get into it and start beating each other up.”
“We push each other all the time, even in our swim sets,” Ioanna agreed. “But then we’ll just laugh about it later.”
“We are Greeks though,” Stephania added. “We’re intense people. It’s just part of us.”
A little back and forth every now and then helps keep their relationship strong, and with lofty goals for the future, the twins know that they’ll always have each other to lean on.
While their future is still up in the air, Stephania and Ioanna are focused on taking care of business in their final collegiate season together at USC.
“I want to go out with a bang,” Stephania said. “I want to win a national championship with the people that I love, and I want it to be something special for my teammates and for my sister.”
For Ioanna, it’s about enjoying the time she has left at USC with her sister.
“I love this place and I love playing with Stef, so I’m just going to make the most of every moment that I have here with her,” she said.
Rarely will you see one Haralabidis twin in the water without the other, and by the looks of it, it’s probably going to stay that way for a long time.

There are a few traditions that span decades of the Super Bowl — wings, beer, crazy halftime shows, that one uncle who gets too drunk and thinks he’s turned into Joe Buck. And, of course, there’s the annual tradition of watching a handful of former Trojans duke it out on football’s biggest stage.
With 116 total appearances, the Trojans boast the second-largest number of alumni in the Super Bowl, outflanking UCLA, Michigan and Penn State.
But this year, the 51st Super Bowl took place without any USC alumni present on the field.
It was a rather odd sight to see. Before Sunday, there had only been five Super Bowls without a Trojan on either sideline. The players who made it to the championship were game changers: the likes of Marcus Allen, Keyshawn Johnson and Clay Matthews. Three were named Super Bowl MVP, including current Athletic Director Lynn Swann.
Before anyone starts speculating that the prestige of USC football is dying out, let’s take a quick look back at the 2015 Super Bowl, when the Seattle Seahawks listed a combined 16 former Trojans on their roster and coaching staff. The skill level of USC alumni is clear, even if they aren’t always present in the championship game.
For instance, oddly enough, the New England Patriots didn’t — and still don’t — roster a single Trojan on their team in 2015, when they eventually took home the Super Bowl trophy in a last-minute heart stopper.
However, this year’s Super Bowl brings into question what type of impact the Trojans are bringing to the NFL. In the past, names shaped by USC such as Junior Seau, Troy Polamalu and Marcus Allen brought fear into the hearts of opposing fans. My mother still jokes that she had nightmares of Seau chasing her after he clobbered our Kansas City Chiefs’ offensive line for four quarters.
That isn’t the case for former Trojan stars anymore. Reggie Bush used to carve defenses apart with his speed and agility, averaging close to 1,000 yards a season during his breakout from 2011 to 2013. But in 2016, he earned a devastating total of -3 yards for the Buffalo Bills on their way to a 7-9 season.
The same goes for Matthews, who fought off ankle, hamstring and shoulder injuries this year to finish with half as many sacks and tackles than he has consistently posted in years past. And Trojan quarterbacks don’t fare much better. Carson Palmer tossed 364 yards on his way to the Cardinals’ 7-8-1 finish, and Cody Kessler barely broke 100 yards in his rookie season. Even Brian Cushing, an inside linebacker for the Houston Texans, saw the same slow down in his eighth season after graduating from USC.
It might just be a fluke — the result of a few poorly timed injuries — but it’s hard to argue against the facts: 2016 wasn’t a good year for the Trojans left in the NFL.
The dominance of the USC football program’s impact in the pro league stretches back for decades, with more NFL draft picks (496) than any other university. Only USC and Michigan can claim an NFL draftee every year since 1939, and those 78 years saw hundreds of Trojans become pro athletes.
So what happened? It’s not as if USC struggled to put players into the NFL: At the start of the summer, there were 51 alumni on NFL teams, including 11 recently graduated rookies. Trojans could be found on 25 pro rosters, mostly consisting of linebackers, defensive backs and linemen.
The year before, 35 Trojans made opening day rosters, more than any other program except for LSU and Miami. And for 40 years, the Trojans led the NFL in total players represented on teams.
What was it about this year? While I’d be fascinated to hear the wildest speculations of how the Patriots are conspiring against USC, I’d put it down to a simple realization that we’ve all come to this season — it’s time for the Trojans to turn a new page in their history.
It’s a universally recognized truth that Trojan football is marked by different eras of coaching. But ever since our last great era ended with Pete Carroll’s departure for the NFL, there’s been a visible gap in the Trojans’ impact at the professional level. Our campus stars don’t become NFL stars, and it’s rare to see little kids wearing the jerseys of any USC players who graduated after 2009.
But anyone who watched this year’s season can agree that we’ve officially ushered in a new era: the Clay Helton era of USC football. As fans, we can’t be sure where this era will take us, although the aftertaste of the Rose Bowl and the promise of a future led by redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold has a dangerously promising feeling to it.
It’s hard to tell if it will be this year’s class of Trojans — who range from wideout JuJu Smith Schuster to offensive tackle Zach Banner — will be the ones to kick start a new wave of USC dominance in the pros. Maybe it will take a few years and a combination of Helton’s phenomenal recruiting skills and his coaching methods. But as the Trojans continue to regain their pride and prestige in the NCAA, fans can count on the fact that our future alumni will gain the same recognition in the pros.
As a program, the Trojans are starting a new chapter. And in a few years, the NFL will have Clay Helton to thank for that.

Hey Julia Poe, what do you mean when you said Carson Palmer tossed for 364 yards and Kessler 100 yards during the last season? Seems like tossed refers to passing which would make that statement more than ridiculous. Offensive skill positions
have not surfaced well in the NFL in the last many years for whatever reasons.

Just days after losing Super Bowl LI, the NFC champion Atlanta Falcons hired former Trojan head coach Steve Sarkisian to take over duties as offensive coordinator. The move comes after the Falcons’ former offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan accepted a head coaching job with the San Francisco 49ers on Monday afternoon.
After spending five years at USC as quarterbacks coach, offensive coordinator and assistant head coach, Sarkisian got his first opportunity as a head coach at Washington in 2009. After Lane Kiffin, the current head coach of Florida Atlantic, was fired on the airport tarmac, Sarkisian left Washington to lead USC in 2013.
Sarkisian’s tenure at USC was one marked by controversy. A promising head coaching career was nearly derailed when Sarkisian showed up intoxicated to several functions.
After being fired in the middle of the 2015 season, Sarkisian had a stint as a television analyst to stay involved in the game, and he got another opportunity when he joined another former USC head coach in Kiffin at perennial powerhouse Alabama, taking a job as an offensive consultant. Sarkisian was then thrust into the role of offensive coordinator in the 2017 National Championship when Kiffin was dismissed a week before the season’s end.
Sarkisian will now go from the NCAA’s runner-up to the NFL’s. He steps into a seemingly ideal scenario for a promotion to the NFL: With MVP Matt Ryan at quarterback and an elite wide receiver in Julio Jones, Sarkisian has a bevy of weapons to work with.
Falcons head coach Dan Quinn previously worked under Pete Carroll with the Seattle Seahawks, serving as the defensive coordinator during Seattle’s Super Bowl-winning season, and Quinn now brings in Sarkisian to run the offense while he oversees everything else. Entering his first year in the NFL since he was a quarterbacks coach for the Oakland Raiders in 2004, Sarkisian will look to replicate the success that Shanahan had with the Falcons’ offense this season.
