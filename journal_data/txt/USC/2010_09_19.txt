The sound of the USC fight song echoing from the locker room for the first time this season might have been an especially welcome sound for Trojan fans within earshot — not simply because the Trojans came away from their Saturday matchup against Minnesota with a win, but because for the first time in 2010, the team felt it actually deserved to sing the post-game tune that has for so long represented victory.
After two shaky wins to start the season, the Trojans were able to get into the rhythm that so many expected to see from the season’s start, defeating the Gophers 32-21 on the road to improve to 3-0.

“It was good to get the win,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin. “This has been two long road trips that we’ve gone on out of the first three weeks … but I was pleased that we are 3-0 heading into conference play. 3-0, which is the goal, always — to win every game that they let us play. I’m pleased with that.”
The Trojans relied on their running game to set the tone, utilizing four different backs who racked up a total of 224 yards and two touchdowns. Most notable was senior tailback Allen Bradford, who ran 12 times for 131 yards on the day, including a 56-yard touchdown that put the Trojans up 32-14 and effectively sealed the win for USC.
“I was just out there running, just doing what I can do. I was just waiting for the opportunity to knock on my door,” Bradford said. “I knew when my number was called I was going to run hard and be physical.”
Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley helped to balance out the Trojan attack with two touchdowns and 192 yards on 17-26 passing, including a 53-yard strike to senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson. But throwing the ball wasn’t always effective for USC, as Barkley was intercepted twice — the first time he has been picked off all season — and Minnesota was able to convert one of the opportunities into seven points.
“[The interceptions mean] a lot to me,” Barkley said. “You can’t be doing that in a big game because it’s all about positioning and holding onto the ball. This game it didn’t catch up to us, but in the future you can’t be putting the ball up like that … Things can be fixed on my part to prevent that, so I’ll try to eliminate those next week.”
The Trojans actually trailed twice in the game, as the Gophers found their way onto the scoreboard first with a one-yard DeLeon Eskridge rushing touchdown in the first quarter, and then again on a 31-yard touchdown pass to Da’Jon McKnight in the third to take a 14-13 lead.
But each time, USC responded with scores of its own. The first came from a three-yard touchdown run by redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler to tie the game after the extra point at 7-7, and the Trojans bounced back after Minnesota’s second score with a 97-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by freshman wide receiver Robert Woods to go ahead 19-14.
“It helped the team,” Woods said of his return. “It picked us up, and it helped the team get going … I knew I had it when I first hit the hole.”
Although penalties remained the taboo subject at practice last week, the Trojans were able to lessen the problem Saturday with a significant improvement in the area. USC still committed seven penalties for 71 yards, but the total fell well short of the 12 penalties and 120 yards averaged by the team coming into the game.
“We’re going the right direction, but [the penalties] are still there and they are critical ones. A 15-yard chop block and 15-yard cut block — that’s 30 yards,” Kiffin said. “So we’ve got a ways to go.”
Although problems for USC still exist, the team’s record remains perfect as it enters Pac-10 play next weekend. And just like the weeks prior, Kiffin expects there to be improvement yet again before the Trojans head to Pullman, Wash. to face Washington State.
“We’re excited to be 3-0, but obviously we have a long way to go and a lot of stuff to work on,” he said.
This was NOT an impressive win for USC. I did not like the coaching decisions at all. Going for 2 point conversions for NO reason 3 times and NOT making a single one! The Minnesota Gophers are not even an average team and the score should have been a blowout. The turnovers were a disgrace. Just wait until Stanford and Oregon play SC. You’ll see exactly how poorly Kiffin is prepared to face quality opponents.
Sound story, James Bianchi.  Fanciful lead paragraphs seem to be the trend now, but that aside, good work!

The aptly titled UPROAR Festival overtook the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater over the weekend, leaving behind a smokey trail of satisfied, if intoxicated, metalheads in its wake.
Beginning at 3 p.m., UPROAR was an event that definitely took some stamina to get through. Luckily, the tour was sponsored by Rockstar Energy Drink, and there was no shortage of booths stocked with the product. But the day’s main focus was the intense music of its featured artists. For the first few hours, lesser known bands warmed up the crowd on the Jägermeister Stage.
The guys of Hail The Villain appeared to be about as edgy as Hot Topic employees, but the Canadian outfit was more than able to put on an entertaining, fast-paced set. No new ground was broken, but lead singer Bryan Crouch boasted a gritty voice that complemented his band’s catchy riffs well.
New Medicine was a good follow up act, switching gears with its refined punk sound. Though these two bands might have felt more at home on the Vans Warped Tour, both were able to keep up with the UPROAR audience and added variety to the lineup.
Closing the Jägermeister Stage were Airbourne and Hellyeah, rougher acts more in-tune to the UPROAR vibe. Australia’s Airbourne pleased the crowd with shredding guitar solos and lots of energy. Resembling something akin to a poor man’s AC/DC, the band’s metal roots came with a classic rock crunch. By the time Hellyeah began its performance, everyone had downed their $10 cups of beer (or those complementary cans of Rockstar, for attendees under 21) and were ready to do some hardcore headbanging.
Hellyeah did not disappoint. Featuring members of Mudvayne, Pantera and Nothingface, the dirty south supergroup kicked off its set with the shamelessly self-titled number “Hellyeah,” a blaring anthem to individuality which forshadowed of what was to come in its set. Front man Chad Gray displayed his urgent, gravelly vocals that were actually a little bit frightening, in a good way.
After that heavy gig, the crowd collectively staggered its way toward the main stage for a more melodic set from Halestorm. Lead singer Lzzy Hale proved she can hold her own in a thoroughly male genre. The unique sultriness of her voice only added to the hard-hitting music of the band.
The band members put on a fine show, making the most of their deserved spot on the main stage. But at times, their lyrics sounded sophomoric in comparison to the more extreme subject matter other bands at the festival tackled.
Next up was Stone Sour, a Midwestern group with a Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance under its belt. For having two members of shock rockers Slipknot — guitarist Jim Root and vocalist Corey Taylor — Stone Sour was mellower than expected. Make no mistake, the band members do rock. But Taylor looked more comfortable delivering the radio-friendly ballad “Through Glass” than he did with heavier songs.
Aside from awkwardly vulgar jokes the band dropped, Stone Sour managed to put on quite an enjoyable show. The audience barely noticed it, however, as most of them were eagerly awaiting the next act to arrive.
When the lights dimmed, signaling the arrival of co-headliners Avenged Sevenfold, the crowd’s energy instantly picked up. Second and third mosh pits began to form in the lawn area of the amphitheater, complete with a fan breathing fire out of his mouth.
With A7X, as it is also referred to, seconds away from performing, no one seemed to be concerned by the possibility of a grass fire breaking out. Pyrotechnic flames were ablaze on the stage as well, along with other intricate props such as cemetery gates. A man with an assumed noose around his neck suddenly dropped from the ceiling, hanging in midair as the band took the stage.
Following that brutal entrance, A7X provided Irvine, Calif., with a substantial set. It was easily the night’s best moment when A7X paid tribute to the late James “The Rev” Sullivan, its former drummer, by putting on a genuinely poignant performance of “So Far Away.” The band ended things on a positive note with the upbeat “Almost Easy” and a proclamation of gratitude to its hometown.
Wrapping up the night, Disturbed started off right with a hammering rendition of “Asylum.” The group’s decor reflected the mental institution theme, featuring a large screen projecting vivid pictures and videos that were, well, disturbing. Highlights of the set included a four-song medley and their distinct cover of “Land Of Confusion,” originally a track recorded by Genesis.
While the band sounded consistently strong, lead singer David Draiman felt disconnected at times. By the last leg of songs, his vocals sounded almost lazy and momentum was lost for good, even during the encore of eerie thrasher “Down With the Sickness.”
Overall, UPROAR is a solid addition to the fall music scene with plenty to offer any hard rock fan. After hours of such extreme listening, surely the ears of all who attended last Friday’s show will continue to ring at least until midweek.

The story:  Someone lit a fuse attached to Robert Woods.
Minnesota had just taken the lead midway through the third quarter and was hoping to stop a USC offense that had been sputtering along. It never got that chance.
Freshman wide receiver Woods caught the kickoff on the Trojans three-yard line, eluded the first wave of the Golden Gophers’ kickoff unit and 97 yards later put the Trojans back up for good. Woods, who has only played three games in his collegiate career, grew up on that play.
To the races - Freshman wide receiver Robert Woods jump-started the Trojans with an 97-yard kickoff return in the third quarter on Saturday. The score put USC ahead 19-14 and the Trojans lead for the rest of the game. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
“If you don’t return a kick, then you’re a firecracker. That’s what coach Baxter says,” senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson said. “When you do return a kick, you become a bomb, and today he became a bomb.”
Woods’ touchdown swung the momentum back into USC’s favor and lifted the whole team.
“I was on the side where Woody caught the ball so I was running down the whole sideline and looking at our team. Everyone was going crazy,” sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley said. “Scores like that and big plays like that on special teams are huge for a team.”
USC controlled the tempo after halftime as the running game got going. With Barkley having a so-so passing day, senior tailback Allen Bradford became USC’s work horse.
Bradford, who has seen minimal playing time this year behind redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler, led the team with 12 carries for 131 yards and made a strong case to be the starter next week.
“He had a good week at practice which speaks a lot for him,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “It’s a great lesson for our team. He could’ve went in the tank very easily, could’ve said things in the media. He practiced really hard and it paid off for him, which is a good story for all our players to see.”
Defensive line: Aside from Woods’ kickoff return, the story of the game was USC’s defensive line play. The unit held Minnesota running back Duane Bennett — who came into this game as the sixth-leading rusher in the country averaging 145.5 yards per game — to just eight yards on seven carries.
The line established itself early, clogging the holes and recording tackles in the backfield. Despite the lack of success running the ball early on, Minnesota kept pounding away and USC came up with the stops. Overall, the Golden Gophers rushed 37 times for just 83 yards.
“It was real surprising they went for the run even though they kept getting stuffed,” junior defensive tackle Jurrell Casey said. “I thought they’d go to the air, but, hey, let them keep running and we’ll keep stopping them.”
Going for two: Kiffin’s love affair with the two-point conversion attempt remained on display this weekend. The Trojans went for two points on three of five touchdowns they scored and didn’t convert a single one. Though it didn’t cost them the game, it did cost them the lead at one point. The failed two-point conversion after the second touchdown left USC up 13-7, thus trailing when the Golden Gophers scored their next touchdown and converted the extra point.
“It kills some momentum,” Kiffin said. “But there are certain looks on our two-point conversions where we’re going to go for it. They’re not all going to work, but we’d like to think that when we make those decisions the percentages are in our favor. I think positive. If you make it, then you’re in a two-score game.”
Big plays: Three of the five USC touchdowns came on plays of more than 50 yards, including Barkley’s 53-yard touchdown pass to Ronald Johnson in the second quarter to put USC up 13-7. That was a big play for Johnson, who was battling the flu and had to leave the field multiple times to go to the locker room. As a result, Johnson didn’t play as much — registering just three catches for 63 yards — but still managed to connect with Barkley on one of his only sprints down the field.
Johnson said he was extremely satisfied when he ran into the endzone and saw no penalty flags, something that has been rare this year. Matt Barkley’s 47-yard touchdown pass to Johnson on a similar play last week was nullified because of a holding penalty.
“I looked back and saw no flags, which was great. I was thinking ‘I hope nobody held,’” Johnson said.
OMG! I can’t believe Kiffin’s remarks about 2 point conversions! They have played 3 weak teams and struggled with all of them! This does NOT bode well for the men of Troy! Just wait until we face quality teams and get our butt’s kicked. It won’t take long to see Kiffin is NOT the long term replacement for Pete Carroll. May his tenure be short lived! GO TROJANS! FIGHT ON!

The No. 7 USC women’s volleyball team remains undefeated after a dominating performance at the Fresno State Invitational.
The Women of Troy started the weekend with a victory over Fresno State on Friday night in straight sets (25-14, 25-16, 25-21) behind junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter’s 14 kills. They then swept Cal State Bakersfield Saturday morning (25-10, 25-20, 25-21) and finished the night with a victory over Sacramento State (25-13, 25-16, 25-22).
Freshman outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana stood out in this weekend’s matches, racking up 32 total kills in the tournament, including 14 against Cal State Bakersfield. She had 10 kills and 11 digs against Sacramento State, marking her first collegiate double-double.
“I think the connection between [junior setter] Kendall [Bateman] and the connection with everyone on the court was just great,” Fonoimoana said.
After missing a few practices early in the season, Fonoimoana has worked hard to become a big contributor to the team.
“I just had to put myself in overdrive because I really needed to catch up to my team and make sure that I made them better because if I held myself back, it’s holding them back,” Fonoimoana said. “And that’s really the last thing I really wanted for my team.”
Fonoimoana was not the only player with impressive stats this weekend. Kendall Bateman recorded 102 assists, including 39 against Sacramento State. In that same match, sophomore outside hitter/opposite Katie Fuller had 10 kills, and freshman middle blocker Alexis Olgard recorded eight kills.
“I thought we had good intensity,” said USC coach Mick Haley regarding the team’s performance against Sacramento State. “I thought we had a good effort … and that’s what we needed to have to get ready to get into the next game.”
Haley was particularly impressed with his team’s serving. The Women of Troy had 11 service aces Friday against Fresno State, and early in the first game against Cal State Bakersfield USC scored 10 straight points on the serve of sophomore defensive specialist Erin Yoder, which  allowed USC to build a 15-2 lead.
“We kicked up the velocity a bunch. We didn’t have a lot of errors. Our ace-to-error ratio was really good, and now it’s just a matter of [whether] can we serve a little bit more accurately with this kind of velocity,” Haley said.
After the impressive start against Cal State Bakersfield, the match appeared to get more suspenseful, as USC gave up 20 and 21 points in the final two games. Haley assured, however, that the score was a bit misleading.
“I played a lot of players, and we made some errors that helped the opponent before they had that many points,” Haley said. “We were in full control all three of those games.”
Fonoimoana seemed positive about the defense as well. Although she acknowledged it as an area the Women of Troy continuously need to focus on, she made sure to stress the team’s improvement.
“The more and more we saw our block come together, the more and more it was easier for the defense to talk and get balls,” Fonoimoana said. “It’s a lot easier to see things that we didn’t see before.”

After struggling to convert on scoring opportunities during the first weeks of the season, the No. 25 Women of Troy came away with their biggest scoring output of the season with a convincing 4-1 defeat over the Oklahoma Sooners Friday afternoon at McAlister Field.
“[Our offense] is coming along and we put away the opportunities we created,” said USC coach Ali Khosroshahin.
Freshman midfielder Autumn Altamirano gave the Women of Troy some momentum with USC’s first goal in the 39th minute of the first half.

“I think the offense is clicking now, but we still can do a lot better,” Altamirano said.  “We can definitely pick it up and keep improving.”
In the second half, the Women of Troy carried the momentum from Altamirano’s goal and created plenty scoring opportunities, continually putting pressure on the Oklahoma defense.
Senior midfielder Alyssa Dávila started off the scoring in the second half after receiving a pass from Altamirano and driving a shot toward the right post and past the goalkeeper in the 57th minute.
This gave the Women of Troy a two-goal cushion, but it wasn’t long before the offense struck again.
Fifteen minutes later, senior forward/midfielder Megan Ohai placed the ball through the Oklahoma defense and found freshman forward/midfielder Elizabeth Eddy streaking down the right sideline. Eddy knocked in her first career collegiate goal in the 73rd minute.
“We’re starting to finish our chances now, which is a great thing,” Eddy said.  “We’ve been [creating] a lot of opportunities lately and as long as we keep that up and keep working off the ball, we should be [fine].”
Another freshman joined in to cap off the score for USC.  This time it was freshman midfielder Haley Boysen, who knocked in her second goal of the year off a pass from Eddy in the 75th minute to make it a 4-0 game.
In what has become almost expected for the defense, the backline for the Women of Troy almost shut down another opponent, although Oklahoma managed to score in the 83rd minute to end USC’s hopes of another shutout.
Led by senior defender Karter Haug, the defense has allowed only two goals in its last five contests, posting three shutouts in that span as well.
“[Freshman goalkeeper] Shelby [Church] has done a great job, but you’ve got a backline that is playing really well and keeping the [opponent’s] opportunities to a minimum,” Khosroshahin said.

It was a classic sports metaphor unfolding right before my eyes:
Senior tailback Allen Bradford, sitting at third on the USC depth chart, gets his number called from the sideline during the Trojans’ game in Minnesota Saturday. 
Until recently, this wasn’t a rare occurrence for Bradford, who helped lead USC with 668 yards and eight touchdowns in 2009 as the bruiser in the Trojan stable of running backs. But yet another injury (this time to his knee) just a few months into fall practice left him stalled while redshirt junior Marc Tyler and freshman Dillon Baxter took over at the lead rushing positions and effectively put Bradford on the back burner.
 

Comeback - Senior tailback Allen Bradford led the Trojans in rushing Saturday, carrying the ball 12 times for 131 yards and a touchdown. Bradford’s performance comes just one week after notching only three carries against Virginia. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
Unfazed, Bradford crouches in a pre-snap position, standing behind a squad of tackle-hungry defenders and a team of guys that will fight tooth and nail to help him accomplish his goal. 
In light of another setback and his relegation to third-string, Bradford could’ve given up everything he had worked for in an instant and no one would have blamed him. After all, this has come to be expected in upper-level sports.
But not only did Bradford refuse to sit back and accept his fate, he began to push himself harder than ever to make up for time lost, continually giving his full effort in practice while maintaining a respectful air about the situation off the field.
The ball is snapped, handed to Bradford and bodies start to move in all directions. His first path, through a hole in the line, leads him into a cluster of defenders that swallows any chance of breaking free. A slight juke lands him a little more breathing room, but again the walls are closing in on him. 
As seen in previous seasons, Bradford’s resolve to get back on the field and regain his playing time was there, and coaches and teammates alike frequently noted his efforts. But having to prove yourself over and over can wear a person down, especially when you already had a taste of what was at the top of the depth-chart ladder.
But Bradford does not stop, and finally a slight shuffle and a change of direction across the field land him with open air and room to progress. His strides do not tire, but rather increase in speed with the more ground he covers. He blows by the initial wave of defenders, and his momentum leaves the secondary chasing his backside. 
Even up until the third quarter Saturday, it remained to be seen if Bradford would return to carry the ball with any frequency, let alone as the featured back. But not one to write off someone who’s down-and-out, USC coach Lane Kiffin gave him the opportunity to earn his spot back, just like he himself is trying to do as the head of USC football.
And in true Bradford fashion, No. 21 didn’t waste any time in doing so.
All that’s left for him is the goal line to cross, and as he does so he raises his arms in the air — perhaps to celebrate, to signal a touchdown, or simply just announce that he, the same Allen Bradford that has been nagged for so long by injuries and unfortunate events, is back.
His 56-yard touchdown run in USC’s 32-21 victory over host Minnesota was the highlight of a 12-carry, 131-yard and one-score day for the tailback, who has seen anything but open pastures throughout the last three months.
Whether his performance lands him back in the starting role or not, Bradford has once again proved himself to be a physical manifestation of the Trojan motto “Fight On.”

Po-tay-toes, Po-tah-toes: Why potatoes are sexy.
Even if you’re not a foodie, you might have been asked this question from a random Facebook survey: “If you were a food, what would you be?”
As far as I know, no one has ever replied, “I want to be a potato!”
And that got me thinking: Why  not?
A potato is a woefully underrated vegetable. It’s easy to see why — potatoes are not even ugly enough to garner a contemptuous smirk. It is just a knobby, dull-colored mound, too plain-looking even to present itself properly out of the dirt.
But perhaps that is the most endearing quality about these taters. They’re not colorfully pretty like fresh summer berries or ostentatiously cute-like cupcakes. They don’t have that luscious quality of ripe figs. These demure tubers aren’t even the slightest bit naughty like pork belly.
Yet, potatoes remain a trusted staple in many households. The potato is the most frequently consumed produce in the United States. Can you say the same about Brussels sprouts? Potatoes are so common because they provide dependable nourishment in more ways than a fully loaded hamburger. Whether fried or pureed into a creamy soup, it induces the dominant feeling of comfort.
Because potatoes are so ordinary, however, they have faded into indifference. But that doesn’t mean they have to be mediocre. A potato can actually be quite sexy. You just need to learn to appreciate it and treat it right.
Here is just a small list of reasons to start potato lovin’:
They’ve got siblings
And tons of them. Potatoes aren’t just limited to brown and oval. There are about 5,000 varieties of this root vegetable worldwide. Thankfully, grocery stores picked the edible ones for us and only store about three to five varieties — more if they’re fancy (and expensive).
Potatoes can basically be divided into three main categories: very starchy, kind of starchy and not-so-starchy. The way they are put into these categories is by — you’ve got it — their starch content.
Russet potatoes, the large lump you usually find next to your steak, are in the very starchy group. Sometimes called Idaho potatoes, they are the most common potato you find in the United States. Because of their high percentage in starch, they are best for baking, mashing and frying. When cooked, they start to disintegrate like powder, whipping up into that light, fluffy mashed potato dish we love for Thanksgiving.
Meanwhile, round red-and-white potatoes, new potatoes and fingerling potatoes make the bottom not-so-starchy group. You can tell them apart by their waxy exterior, high moisture content and firm, creamy texture when cooked. These potatoes hold their shape well, so they’re best for boiling or roasting into potato salads or thinly sliced and layered into a gratin.
And then there are the fence-straddlers, the neither-here-nor-there ­— kind of like Switzerland. They’re all-purpose potatoes, versatile in most dishes but especially favorable in soups and chowders. Potatoes like Yukon gold, purple Peruvian and Yellow Finn will fall into this category.
They aren’t racist
Travel around the world, and you’ll see potatoes in almost all cuisines. It’s not just America’s favorite vegetable; it has been adopted into all kinds of famous international dishes.
Just to name a few: latkes for Hanukkah; masala dosa as a South Indian breakfast; fish and chips in English pubs; colcannon to wash down with Irish beer; and gamja jjim (stewed potato) in Korean households. Gnocchi in Italy, poutine in Canada, lomo saltado in Peru. The list goes on and on.
They’re cheap
I once lugged home a 10-pound sack of potatoes from Superior Grocers for just 69 cents.
But unless they are so ridiculously discounted, try to get ones that are out in the open so that you can select your own. Choose potatoes that are firm, dry and not pre-washed. You want them to look like they just rolled out of the earth. That means they still have a protective coating to keep nasty bacteria out.
Potatoes last for quite a long time too. Just store them in a dark, dry place, and they’ll stay perfectly edible for about two months.
Do not store them with onions because both release gas that poisons the other, making them taste unpleasant.
And unless they are cooked, do not store them in the refrigerator; their starch content will break down into sugars, which will once again lead to an unpleasant experience.
They won’t go to your hips
Potatoes made an infamous comeback for a short time a decade ago, back when the low-carb diet was the new “in” diet.
Unfortunately, its brief recognition was only to be hailed as the devil because — gasp — those 35 or so grams of net carbs in a baked potato will go straight to your thighs.
Not true. In fact, these nutritional powerhouses have 60 different identified vitamins and phytochemicals that help prevent high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and several types of cancers.
They are especially high in Vitamin B6 (21 percent of the recommended daily value in a single cup), which — besides its cardiovascular protection properties — helps to build cells, enhance sleep performance and response to stress, and jack up athletic performance and endurance.
Perfect for college students, no? Unfortunately, they don’t work in pill form, but that’s just one more reason to love potatoes.
Of course, there are a lot more nutritional properties to the humble potato, such as Vitamin C and potassium. And potatoes are only a tiny portion of what the human science has yet to discover.
They’re Yum-O
Rachael Ray will approve of this one. With a single potato, you can make a satisfying, healthy and delicious meal in 30 minutes flat, maybe even less.
The best thing about the potato is that it has a bland, neutral taste. It lacks the deep sweetness of its distant cousin, the sweet potato, but that just means it makes a versatile and terrific counterpart to a wider variety of foods.
Beside the three common baking, deep-frying and boiling techniques, potatoes can also be stuffed, grated, pan-fried, pureed, glazed, twice-baked, scalloped and griddled into salads, gratins, pancakes, muffins, cakes, creams, soups, pastas and casseroles.
If that made your head spin, wait until you find out that you can make your own potato chips with a microwave.
Just grab a good sturdy knife and slice the potato into thin rounds. You want them as skinny as possible. Then toss them with olive oil, salt and pepper; maybe add a splash of vinegar and hot sauce or a sprinkle of dried herbs if you’re feeling fancy. Layer the oil-coated slices on a Pam-sprayed plate, zap them in the microwave on high for five to seven minutes and presto! Instant potato chips — not out of a five-month-old bag.
Never underestimate the miraculous power of bacon fat, which is the secret gem of cooking. Chop some potatoes up into cubes while rendering some bacon slabs in a pan, then fry them together with salt and pepper, maybe even a handful of raisins. A runny fried egg on top and you’ve got your perfect hangover meal.
And when in doubt, just boil or bake a large potato (two for me) until tender, split it down the middle and top it with whatever condiments and junk you can find in your fridge.
Some suggestions: salsa and sour cream, barbecue sauce and pineapples, leftover spaghetti meat sauce and Parmesan, hotdogs and eggs, caramelized onions and apples with oozing Brie. You can go as basic or as wacky as you want.
Po-tay-toes, po-tah-toes. Any way you pronounce them, prepare them and cook them, they ought to be celebrated for the economical, versatile and delicious culinary gems that they are.

Loved this!!!! You are such a creative writer I swear
Honestly, though, I think it would have been more interesting to hear about different farmer’s markets that carry cool, weird-looking types of potatoes…or the benefits of eating organic potatoes vs. non-potatoes…or maybe even an actual recipe? I’ve never made colcannon before– how can I make it on a student budget in a micro-apartment kitchen AND make it taste good?
Yeah, I’m a college student and a foodie (no, I’m not a trust fund kid…baby, I eat good on the cheap!) and there are many of us on campus. Humor us! We have more sophisticated tastes than microwaved potato chips? 
I’d recommend baked home fries instead. Just as easy, takes a bit longer, but they’re incredible. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Scrub clean and cut Russets/sweet potatoes into 1/4″ slabs and cut again to make fries, leaving the skin on (It’s healthier, adds texture and crisp, and looks pretty). Toss them in a few tablespoons olive oil and salt–not the pepper yet; it will burn in the oven–and stick them in the oven on a cookie sheet for 20 min. or until cripsy. Be sure to turn them every 5-6 min or so using a spatula. Remove from oven, add the rest of desired seasonings, let ’em cool a bit on the pan so you don’t burn yourself like an idiot, assemble/procure a delicious dip, and enjoy.
Cheers

Don’t by fooled by all the noise and commotion of The Town’s impressive and dynamic opening heist sequence. This film isn’t really a heist movie. The dirty work is entertaining, but The Town is more than that.
The romance between Boston bank robber Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) and Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) is heart-warming — maybe even to the point of cliché — but again, The Town is more than that.
Is it a police procedural? It’s more than that, too.
Photo courtesy of Warner Bros. 
The Town attempts to be many genres at once. In certain ways, the film comes close to failure, at times wallowing down in predictable conflicts and unsteady dialogue. But at the end of its 125 minutes, The Town walks away a success because of its honesty of spirit and a message that is greater than the sum of its parts.
wThe Town follows MacRay along with James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) and the rest of their crew as they take on the banks and armored vehicles of Charlestown, Mass. The film begins as the group decides to rob a Cambridge Bank branch, but things go slightly awry when bank manager Keesey successfully flips the silent alarm. Coughlin angrily takes her hostage, but the team frees her after they escape.
Ironically, this incident leads to MacRay’s and Keesey’s meeting, when MacRay goes to confront Keesey about not speaking to law enforcement. In time, Keesey inspires MacRay to want out of the criminal lifestyle fueled by life in Charlestown, which happens to be the unofficial bank robbery capital of the United States.
No one, including Coughlin (MacRay’s unofficial “brother”) seems to support MacRay’s decision to leave Charlestown. His boss Fergus Colm (Peter Postlethwaite) threatens him, and the last thing FBI special agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) wants is for MacRay to skip away to happier, peaceful days.
This is the set-up for the film that eventually leads up to the classic (but overdone) “one last job” scenario, where there is, as the name suggests, just one last heist before the main character can get out of the game for good. If The Town had followed this template, the movie would have been destined to live out its days in a crowded Blockbuster action rack.
But it is not simply another mediocre heist flick, largely because of  Ben Affleck’s solid directing. It’s fair to say that with his recent accomplishments, Gigli and the J-Lo days should be erased from the history books. The Town solidifies the fact that Affleck’s previous work, Gone Baby Gone, was by no means a fluke.
To top it off, Affleck depicts Charlestown in all its dysfunctional, blue-collar glory, crafting a sense of setting that blankets the film in a palpable authenticity.
Delivering smart dialogue is a cast that deserves much praise. Renner is particularly intriguing as the arrogant, loose cannon Coughlin, whose unpredictable relationship with Doug MacRay keeps the viewers on their heels.
But the film isn’t perfect. Some corny moments, such as the relationship between MacRay and Keesey, seem to be conventional methods of resolution. The strong writing is also marred by long monologues that don’t make sense when the character issues revealed in them are not truly addressed as the film progresses.
Are these flaws deal-breakers when it comes to appreciating The Town as a whole? Probably not. Such flaws, however, serve as great contrasts to all that the film gets right, which is plenty. In the end, The Town succeeds by blending various genres  to create a film that has a clear position on development and morality without beating a message over viewers’ heads.

Apart from reality shows such as American Idol, live musical performance is rarely considered a competition, and concerts are usually about fostering a communal spirit, not pitting group against group. But at Portland, Ore., band Menomena’s show at the El Rey Theatre Thursday, it almost seemed as if the bands were competing to see who could incorporate the most unusual instruments into their act.          
Openers Tu Fawning set the bar high, performing slow-building, rhythm-based, atypical anthems using an eclectic mix of instruments. The four-piece band of multi-instrumentalists blended pounding tribal drums, tambourines, guitars, keyboards, percussion and soaring vocal harmonies. The members effortlessly switched among each of these instruments, displaying their wide range of musical talent.
As far as the multi-instrumentation competition went, second act Suckers were overqualified. Lead vocalist Quinn Walker held a drumstick in the same hand he held his pick, occasionally beating a floor tom and cymbal throughout the first few songs. He also played various other percussive instruments and demonstrated his jerky, flailing dance moves. Drummer Brian Aiken also played synthesizer.
Although each of the band members was obviously talented, it often seemed as if the numerous layers of different sounds added too many unnecessary, overwhelming noises that didn’t actually improve the music that much.
A few of the band’s songs did have the crowd excited and dancing, or, more accurately, awkwardly jerking and flailing like the singer. The rest of Suckers’ set, however, grew stale as the songs began to sound similar and the barrage of instrumentation nearly became headache inducing. The band closed with the triumphant song “It Gets Your Body Movin’,” providing a strong end to an otherwise uninspiring set.
As soon as headliner Menomena took the stage, it was clear why it was chosen as the night’s lead act. Instead of a chaotic mess of layered instruments clogging up the sound and stage, the members of Menomena dominated the stage by themselves.
They used a wide variety of different instruments just like the other bands, but they used them sparingly and effectively. Drummer Danny Seim played a dominating drum kit located at the front of the stage, along with various percussive instruments, including a slightly creepy pair of baby doll heads with shakers inside. Bassist Justin Harris also played baritone saxophone, and all four band members shared singing duties. The band’s atypical song structures and use of varied instruments seemed sincere, not like a forced and overused gimmick.
For such a relatively young band with unorthodox song structures, Menomena has a fairly decent following. The audience was actively engaged in the show, shouting out requests and cheering loudly. The crowd’s biggest reactions came during more popular songs such as “Wet and Rusting” and “Muscle’n Flo,” but the band was able to keep the crowd’s attention throughout its entire set.
Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Menomena’s live shows is its ability to recreate the incredibly complex material found on each of its albums. Although much of Menomena’s material is dense and complicated, the band was able to precisely play songs off many of its albums.
Early in the set, Harris informed the audience, “A few of us aren’t feeling well tonight.”
Keyboardist Brent Knopf jokingly asked the crowd if they could tell that they weren’t feeling completely healthy, but, in reality, nobody could tell the difference.
The band was still highly energetic and entertaining. And if there was any competition at the El Rey last Thursday, Menomena’s commanding stage presence and accurate recreation of interesting and complex songs definitely took home first prize.

The Armenian Relief Society of Western USA, along with the USC Institute of Armenian Studies, hosted a symposium at USC’s Town and Gown Saturday to speak about the importance of philanthropy as part of the celebration of its centennial anniversary.
The event, titled “Building Blocks for the Future,” involved a series of lectures and discussions on topics ranging from philanthropy to the empowerment of women.
Among the speakers was Paul Schulz, the chief executive officer of the American Red Cross of Greater Los Angeles.
“I want to thank the society so much for partnering with us,” Schulz said as he discussed the relationship between the ARS and the Red Cross. “The ARS is very influential, particularly in parts of Los Angeles, so it’s really important that we work with them in areas like Glendale, and other areas where the Armenian community is so vibrant.”
One of the main messages all speakers stressed was the importance of volunteering and helping others.
“Get involved and volunteer. Whether it’s the Armenian Relief Society or the Red Cross, make sure you’re doing something to give back,” Schulz said.
The ARS is involved in international and local philanthropic projects, as well as cultural education and community outreach. In cooperation with the Red Cross, the ARS sponsors blood drives and contributes financially in times of international disaster.
“We believe in helping Armenians and the communities they live in at large,” said Nyree Derderian, the vice-chair of the ARS Regional Executive Board of Western USA.
The symposium was moderated by Richard Dekmejian, the director of the USC Institute of Armenian Studies and a professor of political science.
“The ARS asked the institute to evaluate their activities in education, in fundraising, in philanthropy, in taking care of the poor and in governance,” Dekmejian said. “It’s an open discussion on the organization and how it could better its world philanthropy in the next 100 years. So it’s looking back at the past and planning for the future.
The full-day event involved a series of seven presentations on cultural preservation, education, philanthropy, ARS governance, ARS involvement with the United Nations, the history of the ARS and the empowerment of women.
Other speakers included Judge Houry Sanderson from the Fresno County Superior Court, and Harut Sassounian, publisher of The California Courier, an English-language Armenian newspaper.
Robert Babaian, a community member who was in attendance, said he wished more students were there so they could hear about Armenian culture and philanthropy.
“There was a lot of vital information. [It was] very energetic and very helpful for the foundation of the blocks that we are trying to build,” Babaian said.

The USC Fisher Museum of Art has been reaccredited by the American Association of Museums, making the museum one of four AAM-accredited art museums in the Los Angeles area.
Where credit is due · The Fisher Museum of Art was reaccredited by the American Association of Museums after a two-year process. Less than 10 percent of university-associated museums are accredited. - Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan 
AAM announced the reaccreditation of the Fisher Museum in late August, giving the museum the highest possible national recognition for an American museum, which it will hold until 2023. The Fisher Museum was accredited about 15 years ago, but to keep the accreditation the museum must reapply every 10 to 15 years.
AAM is the largest service organization for museums. The organization advocates on behalf of museums and operates the accreditation program, which establishes standards for museums throughout the country.
The other accredited museums in Los Angeles are the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles and the J. Paul Getty Museum.
“Accreditation is basically like a good housekeeping seal of approval for museums,” said Dewey Blanton, AAM senior manager in media relations.
The accreditation process is self-motivated, in that museums choose to undergo the process. The museum first completes a detailed self-study, analyzing all of its operations: financial stability, public programs and community outreach.
Then, a volunteer museum professional assigned by the AAM will spend two to three days checking the museum against its self-study and ensuring that the facilities are well kept. Finally, once both reports are completed, a panel of museum leaders from the AAM will evaluate the reports and give a final verdict.
This entire process can take two to three years, depending on how fast the museums can collect and synthesize all of their information.
“Accreditation is emblematic of the museum meeting and exceeding the standards and best practices,” Blanton said.
For the Fisher Museum, accreditation means everything, said Selma Holo, director of the Fisher Museum.
“We’re operating at the highest level of museums,” Holo, who has served as the museum’s director since 1981, said. “Because we’re accredited, we know how to take care of the art.”
However, as the years go on, the accreditation process becomes more difficult, Holo said. The recent accreditation is a testament to how the museum has committed itself to improving its already varied and interesting traveling exhibitions and to reaching out to the school and surrounding community, Holo said.
Fisher programs such as the Art in the Village partnership helped the museum go above and beyond basic standards in the accreditation process, Holo said.
“[The program] breaks down the barriers between younger children and museums,” Holo said.
In the program, children from schools near USC are given art projects during the year by the students and staff who work at Fisher. At the end of the year, Fisher hosts a collection of the children’s best art.
“Fisher has been so integrated into the educational fabric of USC; it’s part of campus life,” Blanton said, adding that this made the museum stand out to AAM.
Less than 10 percent of university museums are accredited, Blanton said. Fisher distinguishes itself by its total investment in the school, students and community. All of its exhibits and programs focus on “letting people see things differently, which is why art, especially contemporary art, is so important,” Holo said.
Holo hopes the reaccreditation will put Fisher in the campus and community spotlight.
“I know that our product is good and our content is good,” Holo said. “We just have to find a way to let other people know.”
The Fisher Museum of Art is open Tuesday through Friday, noon to 5 p.m., and Saturday noon to 4 p.m. All exhibitions and events are free.

USC joined a collaborative effort Sept. 10 to stabilize and reinvigorate the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science after CDU’s two-year struggle to expand the university without the support of Los Angeles County.
After CDU was cited by Los Angeles County for repeatedly putting patients in danger of injury and death, officials disassociated the university from its teaching hospital, Martin Luther King Jr. Hospital. CDU students’ guaranteed access to a training hospital was revoked and the school’s enrollment decreased by 50 percent. The school’s subsequent loss of financial support greatly reduced its ability to send students into resident programs.
With the cooperation of the former CDU Board of Trustees, leaders from USC, Catholic Healthcare West, Cedars-Sinai Medical, Kaiser Permanente, The California Endowment and UCLA have formed a new governing board to redirect the financial management of CDU.
A board of councilors, comprised of senior health care and education leaders from the different universities, will advise the Board of Trustees.
“The university is not slowing down. Its board has been reconstructed and reinvigorated. The new board will map out a plan to rescue the university,” said Fred MacFarlane, spokesman for the CDU Board of Trustees.
Now with the guidance of two new boards, CDU is on the way to recovering from a series of financial strains, MacFarlane said.
Hopeful that the downward trend was only temporary, the university broke ground on a nursing school that opened last month. With no significant increase in enrollment or funding, CDU is struggling to make loan and insurance payments for the new nursing facility.
No entity, USC or otherwise, has announced any financial commitment to the university to date, MacFarlane said.
The dean of USC’s Keck School of Medicine and member of the CDU Board of Trustees, Carmen Puliafito, said the board’s mission is to help CDU explore strategies to remain financially viable.
“CDU has done a great job reducing disparities over the years. It’s the only historically black medical school west of the Mississippi so it has had a significant role in producing minority doctors. We will provide guidance to the university as it goes forward,” Puliafito said.
The board hopes that under its new leadership CDU will be able to establish an agreement with the Martin Luther King Jr. Hospital projected to re-open in early 2013, MacFarlane said.
The Martin Luther King Jr. Hospital was closed by the federal government in 2007 because of care problems. It will re-open and be run by a non-profit company.
Enrollment at CDU could potentially be restored to the capacity it had in 2006 — before the university’s separation from Los Angeles County — if its medical residents and nursing students were guaranteed training and residency in a hospital, he said.
As for the short term, the Board of Trustees’ first order of business will be getting CDU’s financial affairs in order.
“A week ago, outlooks for the university’s financial situation were bleak. Now they are significantly brightened. That bodes well for the university and it bodes well for the underserved communities of South L.A., which CDU has served,” MacFarlane said.
Don’t say, “comprised of.”  Are there no more instructors in the J. School?  Look it up in “The Careful Writer,” Ted Bernstein.
Fight On!

Cardinal and Gold needs more green
It’s every Trojan’s nightmare: USC is losing to UCLA.  Not in football, nor academics, but something that affects every student, professor, and employee of USC: our campus’ sustainability.  In an annual list of Eco-Enlightened U.S. Universities, USC is ranked 124 out of 162.  And we aren’t losing by just a few places: USC is 97 spots behind UCLA.
We’re the 23rd-best university in the United States according to U.S. News & World Report, and we’re the single largest private power buyer in Los Angeles. We have power here (figuratively, of course), and plenty of it. And although it is fantastic to be recognized by the World Health Organization as a healthy university, and the Viterbi School of Engineering is doing an incredible job of building eco-friendly buildings, USC could be leading the fight to get greener faster.
President Nikias, you have an awesome opportunity to make USC a nationwide leader in clean energy while you’re president.  As the creator of Visions and Voices, you should understand this: When I attended a kickoff meeting of the Beyond Coal campaign on campus, I learned that USC students share a vision of a totally green university. Whenever we turn on the lights at the Coliseum to illuminate our winning team, we don’t want to feel bad for our opponent or our environment.
This is our campus.  This is our vision.  This is our voice. Because if losing to the Bruins isn’t enough to inspire us to make a 100 percent switch to clean energy, what will?

Coal endangers health, environment
By now, in light of recent news regarding climate change and air pollution, most Americans are aware of the dangers of using coal-fired power plants. But why would the average Californian, Angeleno or, in my case, USC Trojan care about this issue?
Coal is simply not an industry with a great presence in the Golden State. Yet I was astounded to discover the magnitude in which coal still plays a role in supplying California’s energy. Los Angeles receives at least 40 percent of its energy from out-of-state coal use, and as the largest private purchaser of energy in L.A., it is USC’s responsibility to stand as a sustainable example: with upcoming Los Angeles Department of Water and Power negotiations, USC has the opportunity to become an example and leader in renewable and efficient energy use.
Some might argue the monetary impact of such change, but I argue that the health impacts of coal are a much greater cost. Burning coal worsens asthma, causes lung cancer and other respiratory issues. Tens of thousands of hospitalizations each year can be attributed to coal. Coal plants are also one of the largest sources of mercury pollution in the U.S., which threatens our health through our food supplies.
Although many have hesitated to embrace such technologies as solar and wind power, this is what will ultimately secure a healthier future for America. Students at USC have already begun to emphatically embrace this change — the campus’s Beyond Coal campaign this year has more members, support, and ambitious goals than ever before. We can’t do this alone — this is an issue that affects the community, and needs the support of the community.
President Nikias, help your students and neighbors breathe easy and move the University of Southern California beyond coal.

Beyond Coal Campaign
Sarah, I thought you presented a reasonable argument for a gradual change, but the question at the heart of the matter seems to be largely untouched. What energy source would you use to replace USC’s current out of state coal usage ? Ethanol.?….Natural Gas.?……..Hamsters.?…..if properly harnessed, dairy farms are thought to be capable of generating massive bio gas. THe problem is nobody wants to live next to this kind of power producer…if you’re unsure as to what I’m referring, do a quick drive by sometime and take a big, deep breath through your nose and …..Moooooo, er Eeeuuwwww, but I digress.
Nuclear power might someday be the key power source removing coal from the equation. IT’s certainly highly cost efficient and eco- sort of friendly, but the United States hasn’t built a new Nuclear Power plant since the 1970’s.  The Obama administration is backing a loan program in Georgia to build two nuclear reactors, but whether the president has any political muscle left after November, muscle and resolve he’ll need to to fend off the Gore / Bono environmental groups.
Of course , taking a hint from the cows, we could generate all the power USC would need just by capturing the tons of hot air floating up from the Washington D.C. 24/7
I graduated from USC in 1967, meaning I lived in LA when air pollution was virtually a daily issue. We had one third less people, but cars and industry spewed so much junk skyward, there were days when it was unsafe to be outside doing any physical work.

Funny.  I am actually the author of the first story and not once did I demand anything to be done right away.  I love my university enough to try and state my opinion, just as I am allowed to do.  To assume that I am not educated in this subject matter is judgmental and, frankly, hurtful.  I never say that I am perfect.  I am NOT a student that spends their time “waiving a green flag”, nor do I spend time picking up and recycling things on the row.  Because, as strange of a concept as it may be to some of you, I actually am here to get an education, not spend my time picking up trash as, I assume, you believe people who think clean energy is a good idea should do.
If you didn’t take the time to read what page this is on, it is an OPINION page.  This is my opinion, and I applaud myself for stating it.  I am glad that people took the time to read it, whether they think I am presumptuous or not.
I know who I am.  I am a loving, kind, caring young woman who cares about her university and her lungs.  President Nikias is all about trying new things.  I am not, nor have I ever, demanded anything form him immediately.  In fact, I didn’t demand anything EVER.  I just simply stated my opinion.  
And my angle with UCLA is not knocking them for being a public school.  I have grown up in Los Angeles my entire life, and my mother works for the school system.  I know how hard it is for the school and their student.  I work three jobs to pay my way through school.
I have no problem with any of you stating your opinions about this matter, but don’t cast opinions about me.  You don’t know me personally, nor do you know my background.  Your words can be hurtful, and you never know how they will affect the person.  Just please be mindful that some people are sensitive, especially when taking the step to express their opinion publicly.  Thank you.
I applaud the well intended student efforts, but I guess I have a problem with how this information is relayed. There is a sense in both articles these students believe that they know more about what is best for the school than President Nikias. As if this was his first day of school and he was fumbling with a lunch bag full of grandma’s cookies. He is well aware of the school, it’s policies and plans and I believe he has probably been considering them a lot longer then the students who wrote their pleas for change.
 I would say it is a little presumptuous to tell anyone how to do their job, especially in a way that challenges USC’s value when compared to UCLA. Those bruins are facing quite an economic problem, and this could in part be due to making hasty and expensive decisions about energy programs. If any student desires the UCLA program, their best bet is to leave and join that program. I’m sure they will welcome you with open arms. Who cares if they have overcrowded classrooms and that it may take 6 years to graduate? If you don’t, well,  head on over. 
But perhaps I am mistaken. Perhaps USC students would prefer that their leaders act quickly and half hazardly, in a way that could raise tuition. Perhaps President Nikias needs to sit upon your knee as you explain how to run one of the largest private companies in Los Angeles?
If so, bring some warm Chocolate Chip cookies. I’m sure he’ll be more apt to listen if you explain it with yum yums.
Please let me know where I told President Nikias how to do his job.  I only read me expressing my opinion and letting him know that he could help with becoming greener.
I think it is unreasonable to assume that “people like the author” use exorbitant amounts of energy. Energy efficiency is an important part of the changes that are to be made at this University, and this is something that has clearly been acknowledged by environmental campaigns on campus, as well as the Department of Sustainability and Matthew Oden. Indeed, I think you would find it more likely that the types of students taking activist roles in these efforts ARE the type of students to recycle, conserve water, curb electricity use, and participate in such things as Earth Hour. Greater education on environmentally conscientious living is essential for USC students (as well as the general population), many of whom do not realize the impact they make. Movements like this, which seek to draw attention to an issue and educate the public, are a collective step in the right direction: these letters don’t seem to place blame, but rather encourage progress instead.
Rick and Augustus, no one is “pointing fingers” or trying to “publicly spout off about the failings of school authorities”. There was no one pointing fingers in either of these letters, and surely we all agree that we can DO BETTER. In fact, these letters were more of a call to action for the campus and the new president to step up and join the students who want to see USC take the lead on clean energy. 
Other schools ARE doing better, like Penn State, the University of North Carolina Tarheels, or Ball State in Indiana, who have all agreed to move off of coal due to student movements on their campuses within the last year.  Other Universities are joining a call to move off of coal and be leaders on this.
No matter which way we get it, coal is an incredibly dirty and polluting energy source. I’m sure many students are shocked to find out that we get so much power from coal. It is great to see students at USC working hard to raise awareness about the dangers of coal-fired power generation and the exciting prospects for clean energy right here on campus.
The University of  Southern California is an cutting edge research institution that has the opportunity to become a national leader in promoting clean energy in the 21st century. It’s time for our new President to join with students on campus who are calling for the University to take the lead in moving beyond coal and switching to cleaner energy.
While I applaud the growing student interest in “going green” I think there needs to be more research from students before they publicly spout off about the failings of school authorities. If the process of transferring to a more green institution is taking a while, it is probably because USC has high standards and requires the time to test the value and efficiency of the new methods of energy use and recycling. The technology is changing so fast, that to spend a large amount of money and have the new technology become obsolete the next year would be foolish and not fiscally responsible. 
The green movement is also full of ambiguity and many hucksters and exploiters try to pass off sub-par products under the “green” label. There have been stories about food products that are supposedly grown with “organic” methods. When an investigator researched those methods, he found that the farmers were using their own human fecal matter to fertilize their crops. Needless to say, those $#itty products were no longer sold when the Food and Drug Administration found out. Many dangers like this exist in the new green marketplace, and this is why school officials must take their time. They are responsible for many people.
Responsibility is a keyword here, and many student leaders have started and created recycling movements, but these programs usually get neglected by students tasked with maintaining them. While school officials work to make new buildings like the Ronald Tutor Center more energy efficient, student waving the green flag are failing to contribute to new programs like the students at UCLA are. Where are the bottle collecting sophmores when there are large parties on the row? Where are they on game day, when aluminum cans and bottles glitter in the sunlight waiting to be picked up? USC students don’t take the initiative, but the local residents do, happily scavenging what they can from student neglect. 
These words may sting, but student leaders need to feel this pain and think about their words before they talk about the misperceived failings of others. When you point a finger at someone else, three fingers point back…at you.
In your case, there is also a thumb,
and it is green.
Funny how all the students on campus have the same rallying cry “GO GREEN” “SAVE THE PLANET” yet, I work for FMS and get calls to these students rooms and we enter these apartments and dorm rooms to find all the lights, TV’s and Radios with no one there. Students like the author need to start working on themselves and making sure they are turning things off behind themselves before they start pointing fingers and shouting from their soap boxes. The university has numerous plans for sustainability and so-called “GREEN ENERGY”. Leave the University and its loyal employees to take care of the University and people like the author can start working on themselves to practice what they preach.

USC has been patting itself on the back a lot lately.
We came into this semester with a new president and a crisp new college ranking — a direct result of the efforts of our former president Steven B. Sample. We finally jumped in front of UCLA in the U.S. News & World Report arena, causing an explosion of “Booyah” tweets on our end, and a flurry of Facebook activity of our Bruin friends citing myriad other, perhaps lesser-known, polls that put us behind.
Still, we’re pretty proud of ourselves.
William Brown | Daily Trojan
But as we begin to reclaim the phrase “Fight On!” unironically, it’s time to temper our celebration. Rankings might be a nice notch on the bedpost for schools with such huge chips on their shoulders, but USC and UCLA administrators should be focusing on far greater concerns — namely, keeping higher education affordable for all demographic levels.
Though USC is often seen as the private school with the inflated price tag across town, UCLA’s business school is making a precarious step toward privatization — one which will come at the expense of the students’ wallets.
The UCLA Anderson School of Management is planning to end its dependence on state funds by 2015, transitioning to a model that will rely completely on private donations and tuition. The $5.6 million a year the state now allocates to the school would instead become largely the onus of business students, whose tuition would rise from $41,000 to $53,000, which includes a $5,000 discount for in-state students.
This isn’t exactly shifting gears without a clutch; the program has had to rely on increasingly less state support in the last few years and has already raised tuition accordingly.
The purpose of California’s much-lauded public school system is to provide quality education to students, regardless of their respective financial backgrounds.
Essentially privatizing a portion of UCLA’s education automatically precludes a portion of the student population — the portion that can’t foot the $50,000 bill.
Right now, UC regents are failing to do their jobs and foisting the problem off on students.
Undergraduates in UC schools have also seen drastic fee hikes, with a 15 percent rise this summer on top of two years of steady inflation. UC student protests last spring were prolifically covered by California papers but went ignored on USC’s campus, where the general sentiment was “not my school, not my problem.”
It’s time for both schools to stop squabbling about rankings. Moving up or down a few spots is immaterial if the schools are inaccessible to a large portion of the student body.
Private and public universities are often viewed on different planes, but it’s time to bridge the disconnect between Bruins and Trojans when it comes to thrifty learning.
We’re used to being advocates for our spot on the list of the best colleges in the country; now Trojans need to be advocates for change in the university system — one that’s not too far from our own.

Although it’s easy to dismiss The Daily Show and The Colbert Report as fake news shows — and Jon Stewart will be the first to say he’s just a comedian — the two programs now have a new credit to their names: political rally organizers.
On Sept. 17, the two shows gave a long-teased announcement for the “Rally to Restore Sanity.” Scheduled to take place Oct. 30 on the National Mall in Washington D.C., the event is aimed at what The Daily Show calls the “busy majority” — people unable to actively get their message out to the media because they are too busy working for a living. Not to be outdone, Stephen Colbert announced his “March to Keep Fear Alive” for the same day.
The events are in response to Fox News pundit Glenn Beck’s “Rally to Restore Honor,” held in Washington, D.C. on the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech and aimed at promoting cooperation and moderation in civic interaction.
The hosts have stressed the reality and seriousness of their events, urging people to book hotels early. The event’s Facebook page already has more than 83,000 planning to attend.
There is no word as of yet as to whether or not the events will be broadcast on Comedy Central.

After almost five months and 206 million gallons of oil released into the Gulf of Mexico, BP has officially sealed the well today that caused the Deepwater Horizon explosion on April 20 and killed 11 employees.
“Additional regulatory steps will be undertaken, but we can now state, definitely, that the Macondo well poses no continuing threat to the Gulf of Mexico,” said former Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, according to CNN reports.
BP began the final stages of sealing the well with cement on Friday, which concluded today; however, the full extent of the damage caused by the explosion and oil released is still unknown.
“This may be the final nail in the coffin for BP’s well, but the investigations into this crime against the environment are continuing. Inquiries by Congress, the Obama administration’s independent panel and others will progress until every inch of this environmental crime scene has been examined and a full autopsy has been performed on the spill’s effects,” Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., said in a statement Saturday, reported CNN.
BP has promised victims of the oil spill $20 billion to be distributed through a compensation fund. Yet, in addition to the $9.5 million already spent in cleanup costs, BP may soon endure tens of billions of dollars in fines from the government and anticipated legal costs.

Phillip Fulmer — who coached Tennessee from 1992-2008 and currently is an analysts for CBS  — questioned USC coach Lane Kiffin’s unsavory departure for Tennessee last season and his credentials as a top-notch college football coach.
During the network’s halftime show on Saturday, Fulmer said that Kiffin left Knoxville “with basically his hat in his hand and a bunch of NCAA compliance questions.”
Kiffin’s one season at Tennessee was marked with calculated brash statements and several secondary NCAA violations.
“Often his arrogant attitude turned people off,” Fulmer said Saturday. “The bigger question in my opinion is how does a guy like this end up with two jobs with historic football teams like Tennessee and USC?”
Eight months after taking the job at USC, Kiffin and his program cannot seem to escape some sort of controversy.
