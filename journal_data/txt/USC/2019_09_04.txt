A student was found dead at the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity house Wednesday morning, according to the Department of Public Safety. 
The Los Angeles Police Department and DPS responded to a call at 4:20 a.m. for a death investigation. LAPD said there is no criminal investigation at this time. The department also confirmed that the student died by suicide.
President Carol Folt and Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp identified the student as sophomore Benjamin Garrett Duma in a letter to the USC community Wednesday afternoon.
“Ben touched so many people during his life, and we grieve with all of them,” they wrote in the letter. “We encourage classmates, friends, faculty, staff,and all who wish for help to reach out to our counseling resources.”
The Undergraduate Student Government, Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Council also released a public statement welcoming students to a discussion space for those affected by Duma’s passing in the TCC Ballroom Wednesday.
“We aim to support every member of the USC community and are deeply saddened by the loss of one of our peers,” the statement read. “We encourage a thoughtful and caring atmosphere at USC, particularly around those impacted, that focuses on the wellbeing of all students.”
Tau Kappa Epsilon’s national chapter said in a statement to the Daily Trojan that its CEO and another professional staff member came to the USC chapter Wednesday to show its support.
“Tau Kappa Epsilon is saddened to learn that a member of our Fraternity took his own life overnight,” the statement read.
The national chapter also stated that it reached out to the National Suicide Prevention Hotline to discuss how to educate the organization’s members about issues like suicide.
Students who feel that they may harm others or themselves are encouraged to call the Engemann Student Counseling Center at 213-740-9355 or the National Suicide Prevention Hotline 1-800-273-8255. Faculty and staff who wish to seek help can reach out to the Center for Work and Family Life at 213-821-0800.

After first filing suit against USC in June 2018, five Greek life organizations amended their initial complaint against USC’s deferred rush policy on Aug. 23. The suit alleges the policy has “no factual basis” and is discriminatory toward Greek life. The amendment follows the Los Angeles Superior Court’s decision in May to retract its support of the University’s policy. 
The Kappa Alpha Theta sorority and Sigma Chi, Beta Theta Pi, Theta Chi and Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternities claim the policy violated students’ First Amendment rights for freedom of association. 
According to the suit, the policy, which restricts all first-year students from Greek recruitment until 12 credits are completed at USC with a GPA of at least 2.5,allegedly unfairly delays students from joining a Greek organization, since no other student organizations are barred with this restriction.
The L.A. Superior Court ruled in favor of USC last November, claiming the University has the right to create and enforce the policy. 
In a statement to the USC community in 2017, former Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry defended the University’s decision to implement the policy and referenced the prevalence of deferred rush policies adopted at other top research institutions, such as Stanford, Harvard, Yale and Tulane.
“We believe that fraternities and sororities have a positive impact in the lives of our students who participate,” the University wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan in May 2019. “We want to ensure our students are successful both in academics and Greek life. That is why we stand behind our policy and will continue to vigorously defend it when this case is heard once again in Superior Court.”
After reviewing the case, the court reversed the decision to further examine the plaintiff’s claim that the University enacted the policy to discriminate against Greek life organizations on campus.
“At this stage of the case, we must take as true plaintiffs’ allegation that the deferred recruitment policy was enacted with ‘no factual basis’ and merely as a discriminatory attempt to place fraternities and sororities ‘in a disfavored category,’” the Appellate Review stated. 
Since the reversal, the plaintiffs presented a primary amended complaint to defend their position. This included the arguments made in the original lawsuit and a new evaluation of the deferred recruitment process.
“The recruitment process itself is an important avenue by which fraternities and sororities inculcate values, socialize with potentially new members, and form lasting friendships,” the complaint reads. “During this process, fraternities and sororities constantly engage in expressive activity with these potential recruits. In addition, during the recruitment process, individual students who ultimately join fraternities and sororities engage in expressive activity with sororities and fraternities.”
Nathaniel Haas, one of the attorneys representing fraternity and sorority members, said it’s important to acknowledge the organization’s claims. 
“One of our requests is for USC to produce any evidence that this policy actually will benefit students in an academic or social way,” he said.
Haas said the First Amendment protects freedom of association, which permits the ability to gather with individuals who share similar beliefs and engage in activities teaching and celebrating them.
The court acknowledged the First Amendment rights of both students and the University but yielded importance in USC’s favor based on the values academic endeavors carry.
In the initial complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the policy would cause financial stress for Greek life organizations. They also said it would be more difficult to assess recruits because of the larger recruitment class size would limit the amount of personal time given to each student.
According to the lawsuit, Greek organizations serve as a potential outlet and support system for students who may experience feelings of loneliness and isolation. The policy denies students access to these outlets during the time where these issues develop most prominently.
The analysis of the complaint led to the court ruling in USC’s favor by claiming the plaintiffs had not provided significant evidence to prove the deferred rush policy violates students’ and organizations’ freedom to engage in expressive activity.
According to Haas, the plaintiffs have about 30 days after filing the amended complaint to gather evidence supporting their claims.

Los Angeles Times Executive Editor Norman Pearlstine spoke at the Sheindlin Forum in Wallis Annenberg Hall Tuesday, discussing the importance of unbiased media coverage and the future of the changing journalism industry.
Annenberg Dean Willow Bay introduced Pearlstine, who was joined by Professor Geoffrey Cowan and School of Journalism Director Gordon Stables. 
“I view [the Times as] a window to the future,” said Pearlstine, who was hired as executive editor of the Times in June 2018. “I think that it’s one of those things that the stories come from anywhere and you try to empower people to go with the things that they think are important.’’
Pearlstine spoke about the decline of print and how technology and social media have presented new challenges for news consumption.
“We get the bulk of our revenue from print, and you start every January saying that if you’re lucky, the decline will be no more than 10%, but with the recognition that the decline of print revenue will be more than that,” Pearlstine said.
Stables asked Pearlstine about the role technology has played in transforming news distribution, specifically the role of podcasts in today’s media.
“I think it’s still early days for podcasts,” Pearlstine said. “It’s not clear to me what the model is long-term, but I think when you live in a part of the world where traffic defines your life, podcasts resonate.”
While Pearlstine said the news industry faces relentless pressure from digitalization, finances aren’t his only concern. 
“One of the reasons our country is so divided is I can spend all day communicating with people who have the same opinion as me,” Pearlstine said. “How do you maintain the integrity of your content in a world where most of the people who see your content have an intermediary, be it Facebook, Google, Twitter or Apple News, where everything they’re trying to do is to homogenize the feed where you don’t differentiate what we’re trying to do from what lots of other people are trying to do?”
When discussing the challenges of leading a newsroom, Pearlstine said it all starts with understanding the community.
“We begin by saying, ‘What does the brand of the L.A. Times give us license to do? What does the collective intelligence of the people enable us to do without the brand?’” he said.
Pearlstine expressed concern toward the reliance on social media as a news source and urged caution when balancing revenue and honest media coverage. 
“The brilliance of the ways that technology has changed information for the first time, choice really resides with the reader,” Pearlstein said. “At the same time if we’re doing our job, we will insight you with the things you didn’t know. It is important to get a combination of the two and that has never been harder.”
Felix Bartos, a graduate student studying global communication who attended the event, said he enjoyed learning about the changing face of the journalism industry and social media’s impact on news cycles.
“I liked how honest Pearlstine was with the insight he provided, but I would’ve liked to see more information about the competition the L.A. Times faces,” Bartos said. “But I think part of it is the nature of this type of discussion and that he couldn’t indulge too much into this information,” 
Luke Zapolski, a junior studying business, commended the Times for their local journalism coverage and digital accessibility.
“I think the L.A. Times has done a good job dealing with digitalization,” Zapolski said. “I access their news via their app, which has an extremely user friendly interface. I thought it was interesting to hear Norman’s comments on podcasts and I wonder if the L.A. Times will mass implement podcasts in the near future, as other media content producers and streaming services are moving into the space to add extra revenue streams.”

Esports is posed as the great equalizer. Physical build, gender and strength do not matter. Whether it be an FPS, MOBA or RTS game, being a 6-foot-5, 230-pound man does not give you an advantage. 
I grew up watching traditional sports like football, baseball and hockey. In those sports, men dominate at the professional level. However, the industry has seen a push for women’s sports in recent years. Top-level women’s teams, like the U.S. national soccer team, have become spectacles for viewers. TV providers have started to include more women’s sports, and their respective fan bases are growing each year as a result.
But many viewers, for poor reasons, are reluctant to hop on the bandwagon. “Why would I watch the women when the men are better?” the argument goes. The purpose of this column is not to scold those ignorant sports fans. Even though I strongly disagree with their argument, let’s play devil’s advocate for a second. 
Men inherently can run faster and jump higher and are stronger than women. That’s biology. It doesn’t make women’s sports any less competitive or entertaining, but it does mean that the top female athletes most often cannot compete against their male counterparts. 
Esports strips any biological advantages from influencing individual skill level. I, a 6-foot, 170-pound male, have no natural skill advantage in esports over my 5-foot, 90-pound female friend. 
Skill level in esports is measured by strategy, situational awareness, technical ability and, in some games, reaction time. All of these are learned skills that require no physical ability.
Go to a football game and look at the players. You’re going to find a lot of guys that look like they live inside an L.A. Fitness and eat a bowl of steroids for breakfast. 
Look at a professional esports stage. They aren’t the stereotypical mom’s-basement-dwelling, Dorito-eating gamer you might expect, but they definitely aren’t freaks of nature. They look like normal people. 
That should be inspiring to young e-athletes. Their talent is only measured by their skill and finesse in-game, not biological gifts. Women and men, old and young, shredded and flabby, —there is no inherent advantage. 
 So why is it that men dominate the esports sphere? The majority of e-athletes are male, and the women’s teams are most often separated from competing against their male counterparts. When they do compete alongside men, women are the minority. 
The League of Legends’ League Championship series hasn’t featured a woman since 2016, and the Overwatch League had just one woman in the entire league last year.
There shouldn’t be a difference in skill ceiling between the two sexes, so why is the esports scene so disproportionately male?
The esports community can be both a fantastic and a really bad place. I have met some of my best friends through esports, but some esports communities are extremely toxic and sexist, pushing women out of the game. I would quote some of the things I have heard that were said to other players, specifically women, while playing video games, but they are far too vile to print.
In 2014, Anita Sarkessian, a feminist media critic, had to cancel a speech she was supposed to give at Utah State University on inequality in esports. The New York Times reported that she received an anonymous email stating that if she spoke, “This will be the deadliest school shooting in American history, and I’m giving you a chance to stop it.”
This is just a sample of the toxic culture in esports. People are able to hide behind a screen and make sexist remarks or threats without fear of repercussions. If this culture persists, what are the incentives for women to get into esports? There are none.
In the five years since that incident, the community has improved, at least to an extent. Regardless, there is still little incentive for women to join esports.
So how do we fix this? I will be writing an entire column on the community aspect later in the semester, as it is an issue that would be too nuanced to delve into for this column. The community should not take all the blame. 
Esports organizations and game developers need to do a much better job marketing women’s esports. I have never stumbled upon a women’s esports broadcast, and I only occasionally see promotional esports content on social media. 
With professional esports still in its infancy, the market is at a key point. It can either continue what it is doing and let women in esports lay in the shadows of their male counterparts for decades to come, or it can begin pushing women’s esports on viewers, encouraging young women that the profession has a place for them as well.
This is an issue that will perpetuate itself if not corrected, as women currently have little reason to pursue professional esports. At this point, few people actively search for female professional esports, but if the industry puts the content in front of the viewer, perhaps the community will begin to embrace it.
Sam Arslanian is a junior writing about esports. He is also a former sports editor of the Daily Trojan. His column, “Plug & Play,” runs every other Wednesday.

The Undergraduate Student Government passed its first resolution of the semester Tuesday when senators unanimously voted to officially recognize Trojan Council, a coalition of USC’s four primary governing bodies — USG, Graduate Student Government, Academic Senate and Staff Assembly. Its first official event, an open University forum, will be held by the end of the semester, according to USG President Trenton Stone. 
Stone said the presidents of each body were already meeting informally for the last two years, even organizing their own University forum last spring, which was open to students, faculty and staff members. He said he hopes that making the Council official will solidify its influence on campus as a centralized and collaborative advisory body. 
“The hope is to encourage this idea that there’s now an officially endorsed governing collaborative group … to work together on shared issues, as well as plan this University forum,” Stone said. 
Stone said the other three governing bodies, which meet less frequently than USG, are currently working on their own resolutions to officially recognize Trojan Council. 
By officially recognizing the coalition, Stone said he hopes that administrators will be “more expected” to attend the planned forums. This semester, the forum will be attended by University President Carol Folt, incoming Provost Charles Zukoski and the inaugural Vice President for Human Resources Felicia Washington. All three administrators are new to their positions this year as part of a sweeping turnover of the University administration. 
Concerned Faculty of USC, a group formed last year in the wake of the scandal involving former campus gynecologist George Tyndall, has previously criticized the Academic Senate for not accurately representing faculty interests. 
“They have the most arcane election procedures,” Ariela Gross, the chair of Concerned Faculty, told the Daily Trojan in March. “So they have an executive board that does not represent their constituents.”
Stone said that while there is not currently a plan to include Concerned Faculty as an official part of the Council, he hopes that officially recognizing the coalition will address concerns across campus, including those of Concerned Faculty. 
“I think that it would be great for the Concerned Faculty group to find ways to work more closely with the Academic Senate,” Stone said. “We all have different needs, but at the end of the day a lot of the needs overcross.” 
Stone believes Trojan Council is a step toward increasing transparency on campus and ensuring student representation at important discussions. Tuesday’s resolution comes in the wake of multiple developments in USC’s myriad scandals in the last few weeks. These include a pair of lawsuits between the University and two USC Village restaurants, revelations in the lawsuits against former campus men’s health doctor Dennis Kelly and court documents filed Tuesday that reveal new information about how donations allegedly affect admission to the University.
Stone said in the past, the four governing bodies had typically met with administrators separately, even when addressing the same or similar topics. He said Trojan Council is already planning several presentations for this semester, in which administrators will speak to the coalition about select topics.
“So now it’s not each of us going separately to their office,” Stone said. “But rather, they come in for 15 minutes, present to us and then we discuss it is a group. So I think it’s just a more effective way of working together on these common issues.”

The USC women’s soccer team is now 4-0 after two impressive wins over Florida and No.1-ranked Florida State last weekend.
The Trojans picked up a commanding win Friday, defeating Florida 3-1 at Banc of California Stadium. Junior forward Tara McKeown opened scoring in the 30th minute with a goal off a deflected free kick from junior midfielder Alea Hyatt. 
Just six minutes later, junior midfielder Arlie Jones extended the Trojans’ lead to 2-0 after freshman forward Savianna Gomez’s shot was blocked by the keeper. The goals snapped a long scoreless period featuring several missed opportunities for the Trojans, including a blown three-on-one breakaway.  
Late in the first half, Florida answered with its own goal off a strike from senior midfielder Alex Stubblebine to cut the Trojans’ lead to one. However, McKeown struck back in the 60th minute with another goal off an assist from sophomore forward Penelope Hocking. 
The goal was McKeown’s second of the game and fourth of the season, as she has put up points at an impressive pace early on.  
“If they came out in a five back, then the two outside backs would be high,” McKeown said. “Me and [Hocking] knew those spaces would be wide [open], and we just tried to exploit those as much as we could.”
McKeown was the star of the night, but head coach Keidane McAlpine also attributed the team’s success to the team’s other upperclassmen.
“They know what it takes and they know how gritty they have to play,” McAlpine said. “They can organize the rest of the group in front of them, and they do a fantastic job of that.”
For the most part, USC appeared to have full control over the pace of the game, winning 50-50 balls and limiting Florida’s possession time. The Trojan defense did a great job of slowing down junior forward Deanne Rose, who entered the night with 7 points in just two games. She was subbed out early in the second half after missing a shot on goal and coming up limping. 
“We know they like to get out and run,” McAlpine said of the Gators. “We know they like to play patiently, so we were really aggressive in terms of our pressure and it paid off.”
USC’s defense had to overcome the absence of injured starting goalkeeper Kaylie Collins. Sophomore Anna Smith came in for her first start of the season and had five saves, limiting the Gators to just 1 goal.
“I thought she played fantastic,” McAlpine said of Smith.  “She played calm and composed and made a couple of very nice saves out there.”
The performance against Florida primed the team perfectly for its contest with No. 1-ranked Florida State. In an outstanding overtime effort, the Trojans outlasted FSU 3-2 after another shining 2-goal performance from McKeown, who now has 6 goals in the season’s first four games.  
McKeown’s newfound offensive prowess may be explained by her change in position. 
“Last season, I was playing more of an outside-mid role,” she said. “So this season, being more up top, I’ve developed more knowledge of the forward role.”
McKeown started scoring immediately against FSU, netting the first goal less than a minute into the game off another assist from Hocking. The two form an unstoppable duo that has taken USC’s offense to the next level.  
The Seminoles evened the game just 10 minutes later off a strike from freshman forward Jenna Nighswonger, but McKeown quickly put the Trojans back up with another goal in the 18th minute. The action-packed start then simmered down, and the Trojans entered halftime up 2-1, but FSU netted another equalizer early in the second half.  
With the score tied at 2-2, the game went into overtime for the third straight matchup between the two teams. In the first overtime period, McKeown shredded the FSU defense before finding her partner in crime, Hocking, for the game-winning goal.  
The Trojans had been long awaiting their rematch with FSU, and both the offense and defense contributed to the win. Again filling in for Collins, Smith held her ground in her second straight start, picking up six saves on the game.  
Although these two wins are certainly exciting for the Trojans, McKeown said the team must stay focused on the path ahead. 
“I think as a team we need to keep our head steady,” she said. “We can’t get too low or high, and we have to take every game with the right mentality. Every game is a new game.”
The Trojans will look to stay undefeated against Northern Arizona at McAlister Field Friday.

The No. 15-ranked USC women’s volleyball team traveled to Texas this past weekend, defeating Texas State before falling to No. 4 Texas.
USC dropped a tight first set 28-26 against Texas State Friday. The team battled hard in the beginning, not wanting to give up an all-important first set against an unranked team. Texas State had three match point opportunities before finally securing the game.   
“We were over-the-top with the energy,” junior outside hitter Brooke Botkin said. “We just had to bring it back a bit to play our game.” 
Botkin finished second on the team with 10 digs and 12 kills in the match.   
USC was able to reign in its energy and dominated the middle part of the match. The Trojans won the second set 25-15 and carried that momentum into the third by jumping out to a 12-4 lead, eventually finishing the frame 25-17. 
The Trojans didn’t play their best in the third set, posting a hitting percentage of just .156, but the Bobcats couldn’t capitalize. They hit a dismal .026, helping USC secure the 2-1 lead. 
Texas State battled in the fourth set and got out to an 18-11 lead, but the Trojans refused to give in and settle for a deciding fifth set. Senior outside hitter Khalia Lanier helped bring the Trojans back into the match with multiple kills to bring USC within three at 20-17. After powerful serves from Botkin propelled the Trojans to a 7-0 run, they eventually won the set 25-23.
Two freshmen started for USC in the matchup with the Bobcats: middle blocker Madison Horin and defensive specialist Keila Barra. Horin tallied seven kills on 14 attempts along with three blocks. Barra provided a boost to the team with her serving, totaling 2 aces, and played solid defense with six digs and no errors. Barra switched to libero for the fourth set.
“We have such a strong freshman class,” Botkin said. “They bring a lot to this team and play an important role for us.”
The box score flipped for the Trojans when they played Texas — after winning the first set, they dropped the next three to lose 3-1.  
USC’s hitting percentage dropped every set in the match. In the first, they hit a solid .290, then dropped to .103 in the fourth. The hitting errors also steadily increased for USC as the match went on. 
“That game was very eye-opening for us,” Botkin said. “We saw a bunch of things we need to work on like passing and cutting down on the number of errors we make.”
Statistically, the match appeared to be a tight battle. The Longhorns picked up 10 aces to the Trojans’ six, but every other category was nearly split between the two teams, giving Botkin confidence that the team will only improve for the rest of the season.
“We have so much room to grow, and that game showed us what we can do better,” Botkin said. “We can hang with teams like Texas, and we are definitely a top-five team, and we will be at the end of the season.”
To achieve that top-five goal, the Trojans will need to get back in the win column quickly. Defeating No. 12 Kentucky and No. 23 Creighton this week will be crucial to climbing up i the NCAA rankings.
The team looks prepared to pick up two important wins after a promising first weekend of the regular season.
“It felt really good for everything to come together, and we were seeing all of our hard work come to life on the court,” Botkin said.

The House Judiciary Committee, a group within the United States Congress, launched an inquiry into President Trump on March 4. To be clear, an inquiry is not the same as an impeachment; it is merely an investigation into the alleged charges against Trump and his administration — including Russia’s potential interference with the 2016 election. If the inquiry finds that these crimes are verifiable, then Trump may be impeached — and if convicted, removed from office. 
This decision has nearly split Democrats in the House of Representatives into two camps, with roughly half in support of the inquiry and the other half in opposition. Supporters hope the investigation will, at the very least, call attention to the corruption over Trump’s run for presidency and time in office. The opposition generally views the inquiry as a loser’s gamble, a move with underwhelming odds of getting Trump into an impeachment hearing, let alone out of office. 
If the House brings an impeachment inquiry to the floor, it is possible the investigation could uncover new crimes or smoking gun evidence that, when televised to the American public, will make Trump’s removal inevitable. However, the public has already received the conclusion of an inquiry process in the form of former FBI Director Robert Mueller’s testimony to Congress on his two-year investigation into Trump. 
While it’s possible that a Congressional Committee can uncover what the FBI has failed to discover, it is far more likely that the hearings will only rehash what we already know of Trump’s misconduct. In 2017, he fired former FBI Director James Comey after Comey refused to drop an investigation into Trump’s former National Security advisor Michael Flynn. And on more than one occasion, he asked his staff to commit criminal acts — like attempting to coax White House counsel Don McGahn into firing Mueller — though the staff members either dissuaded him or refused entirely. Their refusal prevents the case from solidifying any guilt, thus sticking his actions in a legal gray area; as Mueller testified, the report could neither exonerate Trump nor conclude that he had obstructed justice. Likewise, it found no evidence of collusion with Russian actors.    
The report’s findings paint an unflattering presidential portrait, but will it be enough to secure an impeachment? And with a Republican-majority Senate and an even split among House Democrats and public sentiment that opposes impeachment by a wide margin,  is a removal from office within the realm of possibility? 
Of course, there are no easy predictions in a case with this many factors, but the current outlook isn’t too inspiring. More than a third of Americans would hope to proceed with the impeachment process regardless, arguing that some constitutional duty compels House members to pursue impeachment on principle, without regard for pragmatics. However, impeachment is not a legal process: It is a political one. It’s subject to the same factors — optics, strategy, timing — that should be considered before pursuing any political position. 
With that being said, impeachment is not the most politically savvy move for the Democratic Party. For one, the impeachment process would take place sometime in early 2020, during the Democratic presidential primary elections. While the candidates are onstage presenting their visions for America’s future, Democratic leadership would be fighting backwards, trying to shave a few months off of Trump’s presidency. This is hardly a winning strategy.  
Even with the full support of Democratic leadership, removing Trump from office would be a far-fetched goal. There is not enough time to run through the entire process, even under optimal political conditions. As for the moral argument — that Trump should answer for his crimes, optics be damned — it would be wiser to wait until he is out of office to try for an indictment. 
In either case, the practical move is to step back, and allow Trump the last year of his term. If those who support impeachment truly believe that Trump’s actions are damning, then they should place their trust in the candidates and in the American people to decide. Considering the president’s three-year run-up of lies, scandals and criminal intent, it should be an easy decision.

The Los Angeles Sparks are ranked second in the Women’s National Basketball Association. They hold three championship titles and in 2001 were the first WNBA team to go undefeated at home for an entire season. That same year, the New Jersey Nets, a professional men’s basketball team, suffered a horrible record but still reached large audiences every single game. 
While the female teams are dominating their league, men’s team are the ones garnering huge crowds of support. Women’s achievements have gone unrecognized by many, including those responsible for their publicity and paychecks. Students at USC need to give proper recognition to their fellow female Trojan athletes and need to back the ones driving this movement. Thankfully, more women, such as Megan Rapinoe and the rest of the US Women’s National Soccer Team, have spoken out about this devastating issue. 
This mistreatment of women in the professional athletics world has recently become a popular topic across social media. However, this epidemic is not unheard of; until 1892, women were not always allowed to play sports at all — let alone professionally — whereas men could play any sport without objection. Sexism has been around for a long time, making this battle a difficult one to win. A collection of WNBA players, including Liz Cambage, Kelsey Plum, Skylar Diggins-Smith and Brittney Griner have spoken out about the outrageous pay gap in the league. According to High Post Hoops, none of these star players is paid more than $115,000. Yet, the lowest-paid players in the NBA are paid $838,464 for simply sitting on the bench. 
Not only is this pay difference outrageous, but it is blatantly insulting to female athletes. The Sparks, along with other women’s sports teams, have proven themselves as strong contenders. In 2001, both the Sparks and the Lakers clinched their league championships, together leading a sweep in both men’s and women’s professional basketball. They boast a 462-299 record and three championships, but where is their reward? Why don’t they get paid for their effort and hard work? Despite the financial hardship, many players remain optimistic, and for good reason: The Washington Post reported an uptick in WNBA viewership by 244% on Twitter and 31% on ESPN and ABC. 
The WNBA has been begging for coverage since it began in 1997. The league has faced economic and social setbacks that have discouraged some women from becoming professional athletes. This is unfair, given the fact that women and men both play at an exemplary level and should be treated the same by all, including sports reporters and athletic audiences. The same goes for USC students because the same lack of coverage exists on campus. Women’s teams continue to excel in tournaments and championships, yet they still struggle to attract an audience.  
According to the 2019 attendance records from the NCAA, men’s sports events average 3,590 attendees, while women’s sports events average just 750. Whatever the reason, publicity is essential to rally students to attend more women’s sports. By spreading the word via social media or news outlets, students can encourage larger audiences at women’s sports events and create a new outlook on professional athletics.
But in regard to the representation of women in sports, there have been some advances. The WNBA will have its first feature in NBA 2K, a virtual basketball game in which gamers compete against one another, after over 20 installments of the game. Now, after decades of inequality, gamers are able to play as female athletes in the virtual basketball game. 
USC women’s water polo team has won six national championships, yet attendance remains very low. This is about more than just a sport. At this point, it is about camaraderie with Trojan athletes. Supporting our fellow athletes can make a significant change for future female athletes.

Lana Del Rey’s music is always full of dualities. Her sixth studio album, “Norman Fucking Rockwell!,” is no exception. Del Rey’s writing, partnered with Jack Antonoff’s production, contains sarcasm and sincerity in every breath.
From the start, her vocals pull you into her sonic universe. The titular track fulfills the album cover’s hopes of boarding you on a ship that voyages into Del Rey’s carefully curated ocean of deep synths and lilting melodies.
Full of political undertones (and overtones), the album is an all-encompassing Freudian adventure of the ego in all its glory. 
The album’s namesake was a notorious egomaniac — with some merit. “NFR!” is a celebration of not only being talented, but knowing you’re talented. 
“We were so obsessed with writing the next best American record,” Del Rey reminisces on “The Next Best American Record.” 
But she clarifies her intentions. 
“Cause we knew that we could … we’re just that good.” To Del Rey, Norman Rockwell represents arrogance. But, there is no denying he was talented. He just happened to know it. And he wanted to hear others say it.
The album’s themes are clear: ego and mania; confidence turned to arrogance; chaos and order. “Your poetry’s bad, and you blame the news,” she says on the titular track, taunting anyone who takes themselves too seriously. 
Every track flows into the next — it’s easy to finish one song and begin another without even noticing. The real masterpiece here is a track Del Rey released as a single last year: “Venice Bitch.” It’s the perfect song for long sunset drives, washing over you until you don’t even realize it is nine and a half minutes long.
Sonically, “NFR!” is intimate. Sounds of sailing on a friend’s boat, sitting in her living room while she plays piano and watching an art house film fill the album from start to finish.
Lyrically, the album is among Del Rey’s finest. Her genuine disarray and disillusion with the state of the world is masterfully and delicately woven through her biting lines and verbal eye-rolls. 
“I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus. Can’t a girl just do the best she can?” is one of many memorable lines from the album’s first single “Mariner’s Apartment Complex.” 
Representative of much of the album, Lana is using her platform as a cry for help — but not out of weakness. 
If this album is about ego and confidence, it’s also about self-reflection. Being confident doesn’t mean telling people you are great. It means showing people you are great through genuine talent. Let the art speak for itself, Del Rey reminds us. 
Of course, it wouldn’t be a Lana Del Rey album without gratuitous references to California. The final song on the album reminds us who Del Rey is at her core. The song “hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have — but I have it” is a drawling confession of not fitting in but not caring.
From the electronic swagger of “Doin’ Time” to the painful vulnerability of “Fuck it I love you,” Del Rey is more sure of her image than her previous albums, and it shows. “NFR!” is Lana’s haunting ode to all things self-love: both the good and the bad. 
The “You should watch me do my thing because I’m good at it, but I’m not going to tell you I’m good at it, I’m just going to be good.” The “You think you’re better than you are, and I’m not letting that slide.” And the “I’m sorry I tried to be perfect. Help me next time.”
Simply put, “NFR!” is good. And Lana knows it.

“Artemis definitely shapes your perspective of knowing that even as an individual you have the ability to empower other people,” Ellen Murray, the president of USC’s intersectional creative community Artemis, told the Daily Trojan.
Founded in Fall 2016 by a group of female students from the School of Cinematic Arts, Artemis — stylized as ART/EMIS on their website — is dedicated to the development of student projects in the areas of visual, performing, dramatic and digital arts, according to their website. 
The group’s philosophy is based on intersectional feminism — a branch of feminist movements that asserts there is a more complex, overlapping network of discrimination, based on race, class, nationality, sexual orientation and other factors alongside gender that continues to affect marginalized groups.
“There [are] white women, there [are] black women, there [are] gay women, there [are] trans women, and they each have different experiences that shape the way they perceive their womanhood,” said Murray, a senior studying theatre. “What is empowering to a white woman might not be empowering to a black woman.” 
The founders of Artemis wanted to create a space where artists had community support and resources to comment on intersectional discrimination through their work. Although the original members were film students, they quickly worked to expand the club’s reach to include other creative mediums.  
“Our members are in SDA, SCA, Roski, Marshall … they’re all over campus,” Murray said. “So, as an organization, we have a large network of people to get involved with and then we can put that network into our project[s].”
Students interested in Artemis submit applications pitching their project to the club’s executive board. Students whose pitches are accepted then work with Artemis to create timelines, budgets and development plans. In some cases, Artemis plays the role of consultant, advising students on how to proceed with a set plan. If a student only has an idea, the club will come in with a more hands-on approach, often putting together fundraising events and other resources. 
“Right off the bat, they wanted to be very inclusive to every kind of art, and we’ve always stayed with that,” Murray said. “If you give us a compelling reason why [your art] is exploring and expressing intersectional feminism through art, we’ll accept it because you’re passionate about it, and we want to hear about it.”
Outside of pitching their own idea, students can get involved by working on another student’s project. Artemis also hosts monthly community events on campus throughout the year, like panel discussions about working in the film industry and a session called “Vent Art,” where students were invited to draw while discussing their current sociopolitical frustrations. Murray said Artemis will likely hold its first community event of the year sometime in September. 
“[Artemis] taught me how to be a producer, budgeting, conflict resolution, leadership skills, how to communicate with others; all the skills that would make me a marketable candidate for any job,” Murray said. 
Murray said she learned more from working with the organization than she did in her classes at the School of Dramatic Arts. 
“There’s more space for failure with Artemis,” Murray said. “Especially for women, the creative world is very unforgiving. You may get one opportunity, and you have to claw your way up there to get it… [At Artemis,] we try to be more focused on how we can build people up rather than just saying ‘no.’” 
Murray hopes to eventually bring the club to other universities and build connections between the organization and industry professionals. 
“So many amazing women work in entertainment, law, production, [as] directors, writers, and if we could collaborate with them, we could get mentorships for students, we could get networking opportunities, [or even] financial assistance,” Murray said. 
Murray also said she hopes Artemis has an impact on the way creative classes are taught at USC.
“I think it would behoove [professors] to listen when we, the students, tell them that this is a valuable experience for us and for our peers,” Murray said. “I wish they wouldn’t try to resist that, and I wish that they would advocate for it more … because there are faculty who definitely advocate for student groups like Artemis, but there’s also faculty who don’t see the value, and they think it’s distracting from the classes.”

If you’re walking down Trousdale Parkway, you’re bound to run into Bovard Auditorium. You can’t miss it. Built in 1921, it  remains totemic to the fabric of USC’s campus: Its ornate, neoclassical architecture and the statues of philosophers standing on its upper ledges give the bustling University a sense of hushed academia. As a starry-eyed high school senior who dreamed of attending an Ivy League school, I saw Bovard as a representation of the idyllic college, the kind I’d seen in movies, where new students would look down its hallowed halls and think, “I made it.” 
The first time I noticed Bovard’s structural elegance was during a tour for admitted students. My guide informed us that the building was a bit of a movie star: It had played Harvard University on a few occasions, notably in “Legally Blonde.” I took a picture. I’d made it.
I had always been affected by aesthetics; in USC’s case, it was the appearance of beauty and the sense of order. There was a time when I looked at the entrance to USC Village from the intersection of Jefferson and Hoover Streets, saw its manicured shrubs and brick-laden buildings and thought I had reached the mirage. There was a time when I looked forward to game days at the historic Coliseum, memorized the SoCal chants and tracked the Trojan football team’s rankings throughout the season.  There was a time when I looked up at the globe atop the Von KleinSmid Center and at once felt a sense of obligation and belonging, I to it and it to me. There was a time when I heard all the stories and promises about USC and believed them to be entirely genuine and sensical.
What I know now is that I made it to USC, not Harvard. And at USC, you can’t take everything at face value. This isn’t to say I dislike USC Village or the Coliseum or VKC’s globe — they all still make up the school I call home. But I have grown tired of the story. I don’t buy it anymore. I don’t buy the gentrified ice cream parlors or Oprah at graduation or the elitist lifestyle sold by high-society members who speak of “good connections” as tantalizing rewards for my membership in the exclusive Trojan Family social club. “That’s how you move up in the world,” they say. That is the show, spectacular as it seems. 
But even more spectacular — or perhaps better described as sinister — is what happens behind the scenes: The Hollywood movie becomes the phantasmagoria of scandal. The medical school dean smokes methamphetamine. The gynecologist sexually abuses the female patient. And in an exam room nearby, another doctor sexually abuses the bisexual male patient. The aunt from “Full House” pays hundreds of thousands in exchange for her daughter’s admission. We’re witnessing a new Gilded Age, a time in USC’s history when corruption and scandal, power and privilege, is hiding under the cover of lower acceptance rates and higher rankings. The road to hell is paved with good intentions and power-washed red bricks.
So, the mirage truly was a mirage. Everyone has heard the stories. They know about the dean and the doctors and Aunt Becky. How could they not? What used to anger me but now intrigues me is that we remain mere witnesses to the spectacle, passive audience members who don’t raise picket signs or march down Trousdale. Or at least not to the extent they do at University of California Berkeley, where students stand against “the patriarchy” and “the one percent” and “the man.” But this is not Berkeley, it’s Los Angeles, where the temperate air incubates a sense of hedonistic privilege, where arguments over politics and scandal become background noise muffled by the sounds of five o’clock traffic.
And I’ve realized that students, too, are not just mere witnesses but participants in the game of collegiate politics. They want their degree, and by extension, their time at USC, to mean something. Students pay $75,000 a year to see the show, and they want to get their money’s worth. They want to experience the mirage.
At the end of my sophomore year, after I had taken my last final and packed my belongings, I shared an elevator ride with three girls, each wearing a sorority shirt. One of them was excited to graduate but she didn’t plan to go, to her commencement ceremony: “The speaker was some boring intellectual,” she said. The other girls nodded in understanding, and I understood as well: Oprah would have been more entertaining. I also understood that this is Los Angeles and not Berkeley, and that Bovard is not quite Harvard.
