The NBA playoffs this year have been full of storylines. 
Can the Brooklyn Nets superteam dominate the league and win their franchise’s first NBA Championship?
Who from the Eastern Conference can even challenge the Nets? 
Can Chris Paul and the Phoenix Suns finally make the NBA Finals? 
But, the biggest and most intriguing storyline on the West Coast is a simple one: Can the Los Angeles Clippers overcome their franchise’s curse? 
As a Lakers fan who had to see their squad bounced out of the first round, it hurts my heart to see the Clippers in this position. 
They’ve got a pretty deep squad with loads of talent at multiple positions.
Forward Kawhi Leonard is clearly one of the best two-way players in the league and back to his old self. His counterpart Paul George, nicknamed “Playoff P” or “Pandemic P” depending on the day, is a star, as much as NBA Twitter argues he’s not and even though my dislike for him rages. 
Surround those two with ballers like Reggie Jackson, Marcus Morris Sr., Nicolas Batum and Terance Mann and you’ve got a scrappy squad with the potential to rock and fight for victories. It also resulted in a team with the highest three-point and free-throw shooting percentage in the entire league.
The problem, though, is evident — this is the Clippers and they tend to perform severely under their own expectations. Whether it’s from having blown a 3-1 lead in the NBA Bubble as the favorites or never having reached the Conference Finals, Clipper fans know to never get too comfortable or confident in their team. 
And it’s no different this year.
An opening-round series against the lowly Dallas Mavericks went to seven games solely because of the ridiculous play from Mavs forward Luka Doncic. They even lost their first two games at home falling down 2-0 before storming back behind out-of-this-world play from Leonard. They eventually won the series in seven games.
It set up a matchup against the team with the best regular season record in the NBA — the Utah Jazz. Where — you guessed it — the Clippers once again lost the first two games before tying it up with back-to-back victories at home. 
It’s the simple reason this year’s Clippers might actually have a shot at exorcising their demons. In last year’s Playoff collapse, former Clipper head coach Doc Rivers was criticized by the media for not making adjustments to the rotation, letting Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic expose former Clipper forward Montrezl Harrell’s defensive inability when Rivers could have played center Ivica Zubac. When Rivers departed in September, some outlets reported that this decision played a role in his exit. 
On the contrary, current head coach Tyronn Lue hasn’t been shy about making adjustments. When Doncic torched Zubac on the pick and roll in the first series, Lue swapped him out of the starting lineup and inserted 6-foot-8 forward Batum. 
It changed the complexion of not only the series but the one against the Jazz when he did the same. After going down 2-0, Lue once again made the change and the Clippers responded by tying the series.
And the team is finally playing with a little bit of edge.
Last year, they were all talk and no bite. But this year, they’re growling like a pitbull, even if a German Shepherd is staring over them ready for the kill. 
Will the Clippers finally get over the hump and take down a real threat? 
Only time will tell.

We can now add “queerbaiting” to the list of terms that social media has murdered. RIP, you will be missed along with your fellow victims “gaslighting,” “sociopath” and “narcissist” to name a few. 
Queerbaiting is a term used to describe the practice of pretending to be a member of the LGBTQ+ community for attention in general or to attract an LGBTQ+ audience specifically. The term used to be relegated to instances where a work of fiction (a movie, a book, a show) hints at the fact that some of their characters may be gay in order to rake in LGBTQ+ dollars without actually having to provide them with proper representation in film, likely avoiding a storm of homophobic backlash. 
When used properly, the term can describe a genuinely harmful practice. I think that attempting to exploit the lack of LGBTQ+ representation in film for profit by doing the bare minimum is a cheap and lazy pander at best and homophobic at worst. However, the internet has now managed to sink its slimy claws into the term “queerbaiting” to expand its reach and of course, absolve it of any worthwhile meaning whatsoever. 
Recently, 19-year-old singer Billie Eilish has found herself in a “queerbaiting” scandal on the internet. The controversy was caused by her Instagram post with a handful of girls with a caption that read “i love girls.” Eilish quickly got inundated with queerbaiting accusations, with many angered fans asking if she is even gay and some even saying that she was using the shock of hinting at possible queerness to market her new song “Lost Cause.” 
I do not think that Eilish’s recent behaviours are an account of queerbaiting. In fact, I think that the real harmful practice is coming from fans who are effectively demanding that Eilish out herself as queer or at least provide a label on her sexuality in order to be acquitted of her queer baiting charges in the court of public opinion. 
Sexuality can be a very intricate thing. Eilish’s actions shouldn’t count as queerbaiting because, just like the rest of us, she is a human being and a young one at that. She’s learning the landscape of her own sexual identity. While I certainly have no proof that Eilish considers herself on the brink of queerness, I also have no proof that she doesn’t. Unlike a fictional character who may have been designed to perfectly tow the line between gay and straight to maximize profit, Eilish is a real person with a real sexual identity. Demanding that any real person out themselves or publicly label themselves so that others can feel more comfortable is not only wrong but violates the principle of safe spaces for sexual minorities that the LGBTQIA+ community has historically upheld. Not to mention the fact that there is nothing explicitly gay about a caption reading “i love girls.” 
I thnk that this whole ordeal speaks to a bigger issue that the internet has of getting lost in doing mental geometry for its own sake and using terminology to no real end. The word “queerbaiting” being used in this instance to try to force people to out themselves in the name of LGBTQ+ activism is part of this weird internet doublespeak similar to how we also use the term “empath” to justify narcissistic tendencies and use the term “gaslight” to gaslight others, etc. 
My point is that the internet is severely out of touch with reality. This may not be shocking to you, but I think that even a well intentioned rational agent could get lost in complicated internet rhetoric that only serves to flex moral or mental muscles without providing any practical value to the world. So, here is a reminder to go outside and touch grass. Maybe even take your shoes off and wiggle your toes around in there a little. Do whatever you have to do to remember that Twitter, Instagram and TikTok are not real.

An Elite Eight run in March Madness ended in a deplorable fashion for redshirt senior guard Tahj Eaddy. All of the work he had put in to reach this position came to a halting end. Averaging 13.6 points per game while shooting 44% from the field as a 6-foot-2 guard in the loaded Pac-12 was impressive.
However, it was his story that captivated filmmaker Reed Martin. 
Eaddy switched from two prep schools, two high schools and two colleges before playing for the Trojans. 
A rising sophomore majoring in film and television production at USC, Martin became captivated by Eaddy’s journey of being under-recruited coming out of high school to bouncing around at multiple colleges before being the second-leading scorer for the Trojans. 
Martin worked with men’s basketball during their last season, creating highlight reels for the team’s Instagram. He eventually pitched the film idea to Eaddy over Instagram. 
Through the film, he wanted to bring Eaddy exposure after his tremendous season and chronicle his unique career. 
“I kind of had some idea of his background … and when I read into the story a little bit more about how many times he’d been kind of flip-flopping around, I was pretty inspired,” Martin said. 
His idea came to life Friday with the launch of a two-and-a-half-minute film full of action shots from Eaddy and a narration highlighting the obstacles he’s had to face. 
It premiered on the official USC Men’s Basketball Instagram account. At the time of publication, it had nearly 2,000 views. 
“I know [my story is] relatable in a lot of ways. It may not be as specific as my situation, my basketball career, things like that. But just being able to relate to overcoming adversity, just the trials and tribulations that come from playing sports as well as your daily life,” Eaddy said. “It’s bringing spotlight to that. I think it was important for me.”
What caught Eaddy’s attention was the idea of having the film be more of a commercial rather than a documentary. You hear directly from the former Trojan throughout the nearly three-minute piece.
Eaddy expresses the moments of doubt from scouts as the film shows him putting shots up and doing push-ups. He mentions the self-belief he had in himself to never give up on chasing his dreams. 
“Under Martin’s direction, Eaddy delivers a gritty, invigorating, and inspirational retelling of his journey and the mindset that took him from virtual obscurity to the cusp of the NBA draft,” a statement accompanied with the release said.
The film came together under an unusually quick timeline — just one week. 
After going over logistics with Eaddy on Zoom, Martin received the go but was informed that Eaddy would be moving to Dallas to prepare for the draft. Martin scrambled to find locations and people to help him get the job done. 
Martin got help from Maximilian Stafford, a rising junior majoring in cinema & media studies, who had a key role in producing the film. Stafford emphasized his excitement to share Eaddy’s story. 
“It was really rewarding to be able to share with USC hoops and the entire community just because of the extreme hard work we put into it and the amount of time that we spent on it in post-production, really just polishing it, making sure that it was something that we’d be proud of,” he said.
As the draft approaches at the end of July, Eaddy will now shift his attention toward being prepared for any outcome. IGTV: https://www.instagram.com/tv/CP_Z3ZwHPdd/?utm_medium=copy_linkVimeo:

When SC Live began in Fall 2019, it started as a space for USC-based streamers to release content together, collaborate and learn from each other. Originally started by two student streamers, the organization gathered other students in a Discord server, an instant messaging platform, in an effort to expand the USC streaming community and support smaller USC streamers.
An official team for SC Live streamers came to fruition on online broadcasting service Twitch under the name “USC Live” in May 2020. Team membership began to grow last summer, and, as a result, talks began to make the team a recognized student organization at USC. 
“You’d automatically be added into our SC Live Twitch team, which will help you with growth and basically be grouped together with other SC streamers,” said co-founder and vice president Lance McMahan about those who wish to join SC Live. “We also have a lot of events that we held throughout the semester … we had Q&A sessions with our bigger Twitch streamers.”
SC Live is open to both current and former students. McMahon, a 2021 graduate who majored in interactive media and games, said he hopes USC alumni will continue to hold influence within the organization. 
“We definitely are encouraging alumni who just graduated, like myself, to keep being a part of the team, and keep adding to the Discord and adding their own collabs or their own experiences,” he said.
McMahon said SC Live even has some USC faculty members who stream, and he encourages faculty to join the organization. Gordon Bellamy, a School of Cinematic Arts professor,  functions both as the organization’s advisor and as an official member of the streaming team. 
Because SC Live was an informal organization prior to last summer, Emma Reynolds, a rising senior majoring in cognitive science who serves as the organization’s current president, said she and other members worked to establish SC Live as a recognized student organization during the coronavirus pandemic. Despite the circumstances, the pandemic did not pose significant challenges to finding members; however, Reynolds faced some difficulty navigating the process of creating a new club on campus. 
“It wasn’t difficult getting members because we already had a bunch of people in the Discord, from them being on the Twitch team,” Reynolds said. “I guess it was just harder to get people that were really dedicated to [making] this happen because I have no experience. This is the first time I’ve ever tried making a club at USC.”
Meetings for SC Live were held every Sunday, with members of the club joining from various locations and time zones. The meetings occurred on Zoom or Discord and involved around 12 to 25 members joining to discuss what kind of plans the club would do next.
While SC Live was able to adapt to online activities, Reynolds expressed a desire to return to in-person meetings. 
“I don’t think we were affected too much,” she said. “But I would definitely not want to have another online semester, if possible, just because I think having those face-to-face interactions is a lot more meaningful for me.”
Planning a return to campus is on the mind of club members, including Kim Do, a rising junior majoring in computer science, who serves as a regular member of SC Live and contributes to some of the graphic designs. With a return to in-person activities, Do expects SC Live to invite guest speakers, collaborate with USC classes dedicated to streaming, hold workshops to introduce members to the world of streaming and join together with other organizations. 
“Some other things we are expecting is probably collaborating with the other USC eSports clubs,” she said. “Maybe [we] find some way to [collaborate] with them just to join with them, see what we could help out with, see what they could help us with.”
Do also hopes SC Live can attend major events, such as TwitchCon.
Despite primarily streaming on Twitch, SC Live welcomes students who wish to stream on other platforms. Reynolds said that while Twitch may stand out as the main platform for online streaming, students who utilize other platforms such as YouTube Gaming or TikTok are also accepted in the club. 
SC Live also allows for a variety of content to be streamed online, including chatting with viewers, playing music, making art and playing video games. Games played on the club’s official channel range from the open sandbox game Minecraft to the action roleplaying game Genshin Impact. 
SC Live participated in a joint charity stream alongside “Rise Above the Disorder,” a nonprofit organization dedicated to making mental health more affordable and accessible. The stream came together after Parker Billings, the project coordinator of RAD, reached out to Reynolds and asked to gather creators for Mental Health Awareness Month, which occurs in May. 
Originally, Reynolds and RAD planned to set up a charity event in December 2020. However, plans for the event fell through at the time due to the lack of resources available from RAD and backing to put on the charity event. When RAD reached out to Reynolds again in May, the nonprofit approved of Reynold’s proposal to bring some friends to be a part of the charity event.
“We didn’t quite know that it was going to end up being an entire stream team of creators, which was a really pleasant surprise,” said RAD’s Director of Strategic Initiatives Jonathan Miller. “We went through that process with Emma. She really helped take the charge on it and lead that whole process, but as soon as she opened it up to the entire SC stream team, we were blown away. Their professionalism, their organization within their Discord, [the event] was really, really well done.”
The stream set up a collective fund where viewers watching made donations to finance mental health initiatives, such as providing therapy for those who cannot afford it. The charity stream began on May 19 and featured a total of 18 streamers, which included Reynolds, McMahon and Do. 
“It went really well,” Reynolds said. “We played games together; we had that really awesome mental health panel [where] we talked with one another on Discord. Then we also had our chats going, talking and discussing. It was really insightful, and it went really well.”
The stream surpassed its fundraising goal of $2,021 (in representation of the current year), raising over $5,085, equivalent to around 160 therapy sessions, McMahon said. According to Miller, the funds will go toward helping those who undergo a mental health journey, which involves paying for people’s care as well as transportation, medical and essential costs for those using the service. 
The limitations of the pandemic prevented the club from holding other events, though there is hope that returning to in-person activities will allow for further events in the future.
“Next semester, I want to be able to have more collaborative streaming events,” Reynolds said. “Now that we have had one charity stream under our belt and a collaborative event, I think the ones going forward should be a lot easier to prepare for and execute.”
For Do, the amicable relationships she had with other members stood out as one of the notable elements of the organization.
“The most rewarding part was, honestly, making friends and the community and growing my stream,” Do said. “I will admit, I don’t think I would have grown as big without my friends, without all the raids that they’ve given me and without all the support as well.”

Growing up both Trinidadian and German, Anja Tempel’s biracial identity was something she struggled to understand as a kid and during her later adolescent years. But with the rise of Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, she was inspired to delve into analyzing her Black identity.
Fusing her love for dance and passion for diversity, Tempel, a rising sophomore majoring in dance, launched a directed research study last semester focused on dancers’ experiences with equity and diversity.
This past fall, Tempel took a course called “World Perspective on Dance Performance” with Achinta McDaniel, a part-time lecturer in Bollywood dance, who handles a large portion of the directed research for the USC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance. McDaniel approached Tempel about the research project, which included interviews and discussions with dancers about their experiences and identities.
“I just felt so passionate about it because I felt like I was finally understanding myself and why I felt the way I did for a majority of my childhood, or why I felt the way I did in certain situations,” Tempel said. “It was addicting almost; I was understanding so much of what I had missed for so long.” 
In her research, Tempel investigated how “access, belonging, inclusion, diversity and equity” affects dancers’ mindsets, and she found that different circumstances in dancers’ lives affect them in the dance studio.
Tempel interviewed 10 participants from various backgrounds, races, ethnicities, religions, sexualities, gender identities and dance forms, and found that dancers’ identities play a role in their dancing and thoughts about themselves.
Tempel recalled one interviewee that struggled with perfectionism, which stemmed from feeling like they had to fit a certain gender role as a kid, and how this has translated into their current life, where the person is worried about choreographing because they have complete control and the fear of messing up that comes with that responsibility.
Tempel’s research also found that “belonging and identity [are] precursors for so much turmoil.”
“While [belonging] creates a lot of community and relationships, at the same time, when that belonging is threatened, it is the cause for a lot of strife as well,” Tempel said.
As part of her research, Tempel hosted a group discussion over Zoom, where she discussed her findings and spoke with other Kaufman students about their experiences with diversity and equity within dance. Though the participants were different from the interviewees, there was still a wide range of backgrounds, experiences and identities in the group. 
The group discussion presented an opportunity for further exploration of issues surrounding diversity in dance, and it provided students with a safe, collaborative space to share their stories with peers.
“I loved being a part of the group discussion,” said Eileen Kim, a rising junior majoring in dance. “I think it’s really difficult to talk about things like identity and belonging and [access, belonging, inclusion, diversity and equity], which is what Anja started her research with. So I think it was really cool to have a space where we could be open and vulnerable.”
Colin Heino, a rising junior majoring in dance who was also part of the discussion, thought it was engaging and informative, as he learned from his peers the entire time. For Heino, the conversation was also an exploration of dance, personal identity and belonging, all common themes of Tempel’s research.
“I thought it was productive. Kind of questioning how we perceive, more specifically, dance, and more broadly, ourselves, our identity and where we belong,” he said.
Within the dance community, there is also conversation surrounding diversity within dance forms, with various types such as ballet, contemporary, hip hop, jazz and tap. Within these forms, there is a hierarchy that exists, with ballet at the top dominating the others, Kim and Heino said.
“There is seriously a hierarchy between ballet and a lot of other forms because ballet has become something associated with elitism, and it’s kind of this Eurocentric art form,” Heino said.
That hierarchy is part of the reason Tempel’s research is important to Heino, as he said he believes all dance forms should be appreciated and every dancer should be welcomed into each one. 
“In each respective form, we’re making sure that we prioritize equity and inclusion and making sure that everyone has a place within each form,” Heino said. “One is not prioritized over the other.”
While Tempel’s directed research concluded at the end of the Spring 2021 semester, she intends to keep pursuing and dedicating herself to this work.
“I don’t plan to be done,” Tempel said. “These … things and conversations are lifelong. So, I really plan to continue this in the future.”

On Sunday, Coast to Coast took audiences between New York City and Los Angeles to witness the sonic musings of artists from USC and NYU. The event was packaged with smooth transitions that showed off scenery from L.A.’s iconic beaches to NYC’s stunning skyline. The six student performances featured Maverick, June Is Over, Ellie Williams, Jeffrey Eli, Sumit and Iz LaMarr. This show was the result of a collaboration between USC Concerts Committee and NYU Clive Live. Sophie Kaplan, a student at NYU and the head of Clive Live, said that this collaboration opened her eyes to the differences between USC’s Thornton School of Music and NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music. 
“It’s been interesting because I’ve noticed that USC focuses a lot more on songwriting,” Kaplan said. “Clive focuses a lot more on production, which has been kind of interesting to see just in the types of music I’ve been hearing from all the artists that are performing.” 
Putting together a concert that features artists from coast to coast is no easy task. Not only were the performers on opposite sides of the country but so were the students behind the scenes who made the event possible. Kaplan, who resides on the east coast, worked with USC students on the west coast, such as Matt Garfinkel, a USC junior majoring in journalism and director of special events for the USC Concerts Committee. 
Ultimately, the project came together just in time for the summer.
“We’re just really glad that we’re able to provide that platform for the artists and that we were able to work together,” Garfinkel said. “It’s been a lot of fun and very easy to work with the Clive Live team at NYU, they’re fantastic.” 
On the artist side of things, the event was an opportunity to not only connect with the local audience but to also expand their reach. Out of the six performers, three were from USC, with the other half from NYU.
This is the first Coast to Coast event collaboration between USC and NYU, and, while it was online, Kaplan hopes the next one will be in person. 
“Obviously there’s a lot of logistical things that need to be worked out seeing as we’re across the country, but it could be cool if we were able to put on some in-person shows in LA,” Kaplan said. “I know a lot of Clive kids are from Los Angeles, I think we could totally make something like that work or if there’s people in the USC program that are in New York for the summer, we could do something like that.” 
The show opened up with Maverick Fabela, a USC junior majoring in Jazz Studies, who impressed everyone with his groovy, high energy song, “1,000 Other Guys” featuring Jermtown. Sitting in front of a keyboard with a Baby Yoda perched atop, he set the vibe in a room surrounded by instruments as soft sunlight peering in through the windows. He closed the set with their song “F.O.M.O.,” which took listeners on a ride through tense chords before reaching a sweet and melancholic resolution. 
Up next was NYU musical duo June Is Over, who performed inside a cozy bedroom adorned with posters. Their first song, “Five Months,” opened up slowly and built to a strong chorus accompanied by a raunchy electric guitar. However, their last song, “Sugar,” was a departure from their initial tone. Audiences were transported to another bedroom, and the performance was reminiscent of the intimacy of an MTV Unplugged special as they swapped out the electric guitar for an acoustic one instead. 
USC junior Ellie Williams performed next. She opened up her set on a sentimental note with “Partly,” a song about the overwhelming feelings of love. Accompanied by keyboardist Paige Thibault, Williams set a playful, lowkey tone as she strummed an acoustic guitar and ended the song on an impressive A cappella vocal run. She adjusted her heart-shaped, red-tinted glasses before introducing the next song titled “Clueless.” As she sang about a clueless love interest, the upbeat song ended with soft melancholiness.
NYU’s Jeffrey Eli followed William’s set with a chilling pop performance. They strummed an acoustic guitar for the first song they performed — a softly strummed pop song titled “Sleeping Beauty” that dove into a story about performing gender roles to avoid standing out. Next, Eli ramped up the energy in their performance of “Nauseous.” For this song, they ditched the acoustic guitar and sang along to a backing track with pumping synths, bright leads and thundering drums, bringing a vibrant energy to the set. 
Following Eli was USC’s Sumit Chandra, a rising junior majoring in Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation, who shifted the energy of the event by using the camera more actively. With a set composed entirely of unreleased songs, Sumit brought comedy, creativity and surprise to his performances as he performed not only new hip hop songs but also a skit with his stuffed animals. The first song he performed was titled “She Don’t,” which featured a dynamic drum track, stunted chords and a groovy bass. Next, he performed a hip-hop song with a heavy R&B influence titled “All I Need.” He closed the set with a song he said he wrote that morning titled “Intro.demo1,” that was slower in tempo and emphasized a keyboard as the main part of the beat. 
The event was Sumit’s second live show, and he thought the experience was exceptionally fulfilling. 
“It’s dope, that I get to perform alongside artists that I didn’t even know before and I’m sure they didn’t know me,” Sumit said. “I think a big part about being a small artist is reaching as many people as you can and so the fact that my demographic is mostly college kids, and I get to hit another college demographic is really, really helpful to me as an artist.” 
Closing the show was Iz LaMarr, a rising junior at NYU, who performed songs “AF1” and “Home” from his repertoire. He performed from a dance studio-like set, with colorful walls and windows that provided a peek of New York’s iconic cityscape. LaMarr’s set was notably dynamic, alternating between two different cameras as he danced along to his raps. While “AF1” was characterized by booming 808’s, “Home” exemplified a laidback, west coast sound popular to 90s California hip hop — perfectly fitting the theme of Coast To Coast styles.

The sun is shining and summer is officially on our doorstep. As class readings are no longer required and students can give their eyes some rest from Zoom, it’s time to brush up on some reading-for-fun skills. Of course, like everything, a book is not one-size-fits-all, and whether you are majoring in computer science or communication, there will be a story for everyone. So, without further ado, let’s dive into six stories for the summer.
For the History Major Who Loves True Crime: “Devil in the White City” by Erik Larson 
For all of my fellow history majors, consider this an expansion of your favorite true crime podcast. “Devil in the White City” is a nonfiction book so lyrical with such rich character development that it feels as though it is fiction. The story explores the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair — specifically, its occurrence among a serial murder in the city. From the architects who pulled off the marvel of skyscrapers to the murderous H.H. Holmes who had a hotel that has since been referred to as his “murder castle” beside the fairgrounds, this story artfully delves into the intersections of the fair and murderer. Ultimately, this story is so layered and complex, it’s actually difficult to believe it is nonfiction. Larson’s writing is particularly exceptional as well, as the reader can practically feel the Chicago lake air and view the beautiful architecture of the fair while consuming the story. “Devil in the White City” is an incredibly captivating historical mystery that is sure to delight any true crime enthusiast.  
If You Love a Sister Stories and a Conversational Tone: “Yolk” by Mary H.K. Choi
If you haven’t read a Mary H.K. Choi book, this is a perfect introduction to her stories. Complete with Choi’s signature colloquial tone and complex character development, “Yolk” is her third published book that delves into the captivating relationship between two estranged young adult sisters. Our first character, June, is the eldest with the perfect life in her flawless New York City apartment. Her estranged sister Jayne, on the other hand, is barely making it through fashion school, haunted by demons that she is not ready to face. When June is diagnosed with cancer, Jayne is charged with caring for her as they work through the emotion of their estrangement. “Yolk” deals with a plethora of deep human issues, such as eating disorders, the Eurocentricity of the United States, and what it means to leave your past behind. It also explores identity as Jayne feels neither Korean — she moved to the United States when she was young — or American enough. Despite Choi’s wittiness, this is not the happiest book in the world. However, readers can be assured that, despite this, the darker themes of this incredibly well-written story are explored with love and a gentle hand.
If You Love Magical Realism and Lyrical Writing: “The Raven Boys” by Maggie Stiefvater
Put simply, “The Raven Boys” just feels like summer. The novel, set in rural Virginia, follows Blue — the daughter of a psychic — who is told by her mother she will cause her true love to die. Despite her aversion to the students from the all-boys “rich-kid school,” she goes on to become friends with a ragtag group of boys in search of a missing Welsh king. Each of these boys couldn’t be more different — one with money, one who is low-income and is reaching for the stars, one who likes fast cars with no ambition and one who is only described as “smudgy.” As Blue’s relationships with each of them grow deeper, one wonders: will her true love be one of these boys? In the first book of its series, “The Raven Boys,” author Maggie Stiefvater has a style of writing that makes the simplest of sentences feel luxurious. If you love hints of Welsh mythology, complex characters and Virginia scenery, this book will be a fantastic read. 
If You Love a Forbidden Love Story: “Red, White & Royal Blue” by Casey McQuiston
Since “Red, White & Royal Blue” was universally considered the “it book” last summer for romance novel lovers, consider this a reminder to read it this year. A book filled with sparkling dialogue and deeply complex characters, how could you not want to read it? The novel follows Alex, the first son of the first female president of the United States and his relationship with the English prince, Henry. After a confrontation between the two involving a fallen wedding cake, a friendship had to be staged to save the reputation of the monarch and the president. Now, the two boys face the challenge of overcoming their hatred and becoming real friends. Without too many spoilers, this story is filled with a mixture of fun, romance and serious challenges as Henry and Alex come to terms with their sexualities as they move from enemies to friends to lovers. There is a reason this book was so highly-lauded by most readers – it is a quick, fun read that is perfect for any reader on the go this summer. 
If You Love Multiple Points of View and Vivid Characters: “How the García Girls Lost Their Accents” by Julia Alvarez 
Julia Alvarez is a highly-lauded author in the literary world for a reason, and “How the García Girls Lost Their Accents” is considered to be among her best work. The carefully crafted novel follows four sisters and the disparate paths they take after fleeing the Dominican Republic for New York City. One grows to be a psychologist, another a poet, an artist and a woman enraptured with American life in the 1960s. The story explores familial ties across oceans and the reckoning the sisters are forced to face with their home country and their adopted country at a time of women’s liberation. Language also plays a massive role in the book as Yolanda, the poet, wrestles with writing in a foreign language — English. The writing is utterly atmospheric and captivates the reader as the island life of the Dominican Republic and the different lifestyle of New York City is described with such care. This book is an exploration of identity and what it means to be a woman and is well worth a read. 
If You Love a Psychological Thriller: “The Wicker King” by K. Ancrum
Of course, not everyone reaches for a romantic contemporary during the summer months. If this sounds like you, “The Wicker King” is a psychological thriller that’s sure to satiate your hunger for something different from happily ever after. Written by K. Ancrum, the story follows a high schooler named Jack who’s on the edge of two worlds due to a hallucinatory disorder with unknown origins. Luckily, his friend, August, helps him cope by remaining a true friend, listening to Jack’s hallucinations without judgement. This is a story about the beauty of friendship, emotion and the cryptic world that Jack inhabits. Simultaneously full of suspense and tenderness, Ancrum’s writing style is dreamy and gripping, perfect for lazy summer afternoons.

For Christopher Ahn and Kalliyan Davis, a chance encounter on a 2017 film set in Hawaii sparked the beginning of a friendship that would eventually lead to the formation of their alternative pop duo in 2018, aptly named “Your Crush.”
“London Eyes,” a single from their debut EP, will be available on all platforms starting Wednesday, June 16. 
Both Hawaii locals, Ahn and Davis found themselves to be musical outliers in their home state where habitants tended to prefer Jawaiian (Jamaican and Hawaiian) and general reggae over pop. 
“I think the kind of music we like was not too common in Hawaii,” Ahn said. “We talked a bit about music, and we were like ‘Wait, we kind of like the same things.’ Especially coming from Hawaii, … it’s kind of harder to find that group of people that share your interests in [such a] small state.” 
Ahn moved to Los Angeles to pursue music in 2017. Growing up, he picked up his love for music from his older brother, who played the drums and guitar. 
“There was one song, ‘Title and Registration’ by Death Cab for Cutie … I heard it and I felt something,” Ahn recalled. “As cliche as it is … I want to be able to have this feeling both as a listener and someone who creates music.” 
When Davis moved to L.A. a year later to pursue a bachelor’s degree in acting at the USC School of Dramatic Arts, the artists found themselves together again, only this time making music. 
Although she trained in classical music growing up and was even briefly part of two bands —  the Chaotic Five in middle school and 85 Decibels in high school — Davis turned to acting after feeling trapped within a music genre she didn’t have a real passion for. 
“My parents were super into [rock]. They bought me guitars and wanted me to live out their rockstar dreams … and while I did enjoy performing a lot, that wasn’t necessarily the kind of music I love to play over and over again,” Davis said. “I definitely felt like music to me was whatever other people wanted me to do, so I wanted to try something different with film.”
Although Davis still pursued acting at the time, she couldn’t deny her love for music and she and Ahn both recognized how unique their connection was.  Previously, she had been made fun of for the type of music she liked to make, but with Ahn, she discovered that she was free to be herself. 
“It felt so different from any music experience I had before because it’s like, ‘Wait, [Chris is] encouraging me to keep going, even though I feel like I’m not good at this,’” Davis said. “And I felt like ‘Yes, I’m with you. Let’s do this together and … have fun with music and make whatever the hell we want.”
Dave Manke, a guitarist and frequent collaborator of Your Crush, characterized the duo’s music as “smack dab in the middle” of the radio pop-alternative pop spectrum. 
“It’s interesting because they do a really good job of [capturing] the real listening ability and effortlessness of any song you hear on the radio, … but they also don’t necessarily fit into the mold of what’s exactly going on the radio,” Manke said. “They’ve really captured, for lack of a better [description], visually sparkly, pretty, shiny music. That sort of aesthetic that they sonically capture would put them in the alternative pop area.” 
An aspect that hasn’t been lost on their collaborators is the pop duo’s active emphasis on inclusivity and nonjudgmental collaboration in the studio. Manke describes their sessions as “very much an open, fun, collaborative environment” where “everyone’s contributing every part of the song.” 
Despite receiving positive feedback from numerous industry collaborators, Ahn and Davis found that opportunities were not as abundant as they had hoped for. When the coronavirus pandemic limited studio availability, the two found themselves spending more time making music in Ahn’s home studio. But, within their personal judgement-free creative space, away from the opinions of producers and fellow musicians that they previously valued highly, the pop duo found they were able to better fine-tune their sound and manage their branding. 
“One of the biggest things for us during the pandemic is that we started recording at home,” Davis said. “[It’s] a lot less pressure, very free and we can make whatever we want in this space and it’s our safe space.” 
It was during this time that the duo finished “London Eyes,” a song they started before quarantine started. The new single is about missing someone who is far away — a concept familiar to many throughout lockdown. Backed by a chill, catchy pop beat, complete with ambient jingles and melodies, “London Eyes” remains intimately emotional, giving audiences a glimpse into the pain of distanced love. The melodious tune is accompanied by a winsome animated lyric video featuring artwork from Indonesia-based illustrator Apricot Mayor. 
“I was surprised at how developed and how clear they were in their vision,” said Erich Nemcek, a Hawaii-based motion designer and 3D animator responsible for the animations in the “London Eyes” lyric video. “They ended up drawing some stuff for that lyric video so it wasn’t just [Apricot Mayor]. 
Your Crush and Nemcek plan on continuing their collaboration on the remaining lyric videos they plan to release before the end of 2021.  
“I’m excited for them. I really love the music that I’ve heard so far, and I love their vision for what they’re doing,” Nemcek said. “I hope they’re successful with it because I’m planning on working with them for as long as they’ll have me.”   
Despite straying far from the popular music in their home state, the two young artists have remained steadfast and honest with their sound, as well as true to their goal in music making. While pop artists remain some of the highest paid in the music industry, the genre, as a whole, is oftentimes looked down upon for being increasingly formulaic.
”Some pop might be formulaic,” Davis said. “Pop is just about being universal and relating to people … I think catchiness and simplicity gets misinterpreted as formulaic.” 
Ahn also disagrees with this generalization, adding that he believes there’s a way to make pop music with artistic integrity. 
“We are aware that it’s pop, but to us, it’s not a matter of where we want to land,” Ahn said. “It’s being ourselves and wherever that lands, that’s okay … It doesn’t matter how many people might want to listen — we’re making it for ourselves to really get a voice out that we really believe in.”
While celebrating the growth in the Asian American creative community and overall representation in the arts, Ahn and Davis expressed more mixed feelings on the space that they occupy within the Asian American music community in L.A. 
“My experience with the Asian creative community has been supportive and also sometimes limiting,” Davis said. “I feel like sometimes you are expected to honor your roots and … [make art] related to being Asian … It feels like a lot of material is expected to be just [about] the Asian experience.” 
The musicians felt the pressure to make material about the Asian American experience sometimes clashed with their own desires to create music about emotions and general experiences. Ahn and Davis said that, similarly, they wanted to be seen as good artists, not just “good for Asian artists.”
Although they finished production on their first EP, Ahn and Davis plan to release the singles from it intermittently over the next few months following the completion of their accompanying lyric videos. While they know that they naturally gravitate towards alternative pop, both are open to the idea of exploring other genres.
“One thing that came out of the pandemic [is that] I think our style has also evolved. We started writing some songs after the EP and exploring other genres,” Davis said. “Not purposefully, we weren’t like ‘Let’s make a rock song today,’ but ended up getting into some alternative rock stuff. [In general], we’re exploring ourselves and expanding our horizons.”

In 1894, the first gay film was created, and it shocked its audience who lacked exposure in LGBTQ+ ideology. Then in 1933, the first explicitly lesbian movie was released in Germany, and Nazis tried to destroy the film (and failed). Gender fluidity was not as well received as it is today, and many people suffered due to the lack of open mindedness that existed in the past.
Now, the acceptance of gender fluid identities and the appearance of LGBTQ+ characters in film has greatly improved. In 2019, there were about 18.6% of characters identified as LGBTQ+ in film according to GLAAD, a record high throughout the eight years GLAAD has released these reports. LGBTQ films have been around for over 100 years, and while representation has improved, it could still be better. 
Netflix has done an exceptional job at providing their viewers with LGBTQ+ films, which is to be expected from a platform praised as the overall best on-demand streaming service in 2021 by U.S. News. With Netflix having the “highest number of [LGBTQ+] regular and recurring characters on their scripted originals” out of all of the streaming services GLAAD has recorded, it is clear they stand in solidarity with the LGBTQ community.
And while Netflix films such as “The Half of It,” “I Am Not Okay With This” and even “Stranger Things” have captured some of the reality of those who identify in the LGBTQ+ community, there are some films that are not up to par. 
The streaming giant has failed to capture LGBTQ+ members correctly in films such as “The Kissing Booth,” “Naomi and Ely’s No Kiss List” and shows like “Insatiable.” Shows and films like these have used harmful stereotypes to portray LGBTQ+ characters or even pitted them as the antagonist in the plot. Some have even accused Netflix of using gay characters in their shows for the diversity count alone. 
We need to remember that content matters just as much as representation. As a straight person viewing these films, I think some of them make LGBTQ+ people look bad. There are stereotypes like the gay best friend or the overly flamboyant gay that just do not correctly portray the community. This causes those with limited knowledge of the LGBTQ+ community to have expectations of what LGBTQ people should look and act like. 
Malia Prado, a rising sophomore at San Diego State University who identifies as a lesbian said when she dresses “scrubby” or in loose and worn down clothing, a lot of people would reinforce that she was in fact lesbian through her outfit, but when she wore dresses, people would imply she was not supposed to wear them simply because she was lesbian. This harmful portrayal of the LGBTQ+ community in film is what prevents a lot of gays and lesbians from acting and appearing how they want to, according to Prado.
Not every lesbian is required to dress a certain way. Not every gay man is required to act a certain way.
The lack of racial diversity among LGBTQ+ characters overall fails to recognize that there are other ethnicities that need just as much representation as the white gay men that have mainly been cast in films. According to NBC News, “just 34 percent of [LGBTQ+] characters were people of color in 2019.” 
There are streaming services like Disney+ who have not provided the same amount of representation and care whatsoever. Ranked third by U.S. News for on-demand streaming services, they have a great deal of influence on their audiences, but they have yet to release a film with explicitly LGBTQ+ characters.
This stands in contrast with Disney’s new Pride collection, the Rainbow Disney collection which indicates that the brand supports the LGBTQ+ community during Pride month. LGBTQ Nation said the company was pink-washing, meaning that Disney was “[pro-LGBTQ+] or using [pro-LGBTQ+] marketing while not consistently standing with the [LGBTQ+] people when it isn’t financially lucrative.”
Instead of thinking about profit, streaming services should genuinely start caring about people’s identities and empathize with minority groups, not just in terms of gender but also in considering other backgrounds.
Although Disney outwardly seems to be LGBTQ+ supporters, it seems like they are always on the edge of really being an ally. According to Forbes, “Disney has pioneered their ‘first’ gay character at least [seven] times.” How many more times do they have to hint at a character being gay before they actually commit to providing the proper representation necessary for the LGBTQ+ community? 
With these flaws in the film industry in mind, future film producers should provide the representation that the LGBTQ+ community needs and normalize gender issues without the use of harmful stereotypes. We, as a collective community, should try to fully understand the implications behind what it means to be a member of the LGBTQ+ community and show the respect that each individual deserves.

As law enforcement officers resigned or were dismissed across the country after the civil unrest that took place following the murder of George Floyd, only to be reinstated in other departments — with some states actively advertising for the rehiring of these officers — Erroll Southers saw the need for immediate transparency and accountability in policing. 
To make a direct impact on the police screening process and culture, Southers, alongside alumnus Güez Salinas, created the Law Enforcement Work Inquiry System, a database to collect data on officers who have resigned or been fired following misconduct — including excessive use of force, sexual or physical assault and harassment, and planting or destroying evidence.
The registry, which will publicly go live in October, will be the first publicly available, comprehensive catalog to compile a record of national data on police misconduct. Also known as LEWIS, the registry was named after the late United States representative and civil rights leader John Lewis, who Southers and Salinas said they wanted to honor for the times he nonviolently pushed back against police abuse. 
In creating the database, Southers and Salinas sought to address transparency, accountability, research and policing policy, hoping to increase trust between communities and police officers, and to also become commonly known as an effective resource for changing the police system. 
“Ultimately, the human element needs to be addressed and many reform efforts don’t address that,” said Southers, director of the Safe Communities Institute and a USC Sol Price School of Public Policy professor. “How many times have you heard after a tragic event that law enforcement says, ‘We need more training.’ Well, we’ve been saying [that] for a long time and we’re getting the same result.” 
Southers and Salinas said that they had always been aware of police misconduct and abuse through personal experiences but there has been an increase in public consciousness through video technology. While these issues have existed long before, technology has made them seem more prevalent and increased awareness.
“If you’ve been tasked to protect and to serve, and you have violated that oath, or you have not been the protector, you haven’t actually lived up to the responsibility that comes with being a law enforcement officer,” said Salinas who is president and chief information officer at Dreamview, a globally scalable technology company that provides creative strategy and content solutions to companies around the world. 
As a former assistant chief in charge of Homeland Security and Intelligence and a former Santa Monica Police Department background investigator Southers said he understands firsthand the difficult process involved with firing a police officer. Even when departments fire officers, Southers said, other departments may reinstate dismissed personnel 23% of the time. In California, and four other states including New Jersey and Massachusetts, police officers keep their certifications without having to repeat training even after being fired, which Southers said can be attractive to hiring departments as the officers already have experience and certification. In this way, Southers said officers who are fired for misconduct can end up bouncing from department to department.
“We felt that [LEWIS] is a way to keep people who have been fired out of the profession, because it takes a lot to be fired,” he said. “If that’s happened, and they received due process, they need to find something else to do.”
The institute is currently working with student volunteers and organizations, as well as accepting local tips, to compile and populate data on police misconduct. Using public information, those working on the LEWIS registry have accumulated 200 entries from the last three years alone, while complying with officer privacy policies.
“The public’s going to be a big part of this; you would not believe how many people have contacted us to say ‘Here’s a link to the officers that were fired from my town that you may not know about,’” Southers said. “It’s been great, so this is a real grassroots effort where we’re counting on the public to not only help us identify these officers but to then hold their agencies accountable.”
Southers also said the system received support from law enforcement across the country, with 22 agencies volunteering to participate in a beta test for cybersecurity, including all of the PAC-12 and University of California law enforcement chiefs. According to Southers, two databases will be  available, one to the public, and another that is password encrypted for law enforcement to search the records of specific officers during the hiring process.
While SCI continues to engage with authors of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021, which is currently in legislation and would address a wide range of issues related to policing practices and law enforcement accountability, Salinas said he hopes the registry will provide great police research and framework in support of the bill.
“I think we have provided a framework that can stand up at the national level, that already has the buy-in from all the stakeholders,” Salinas said. “It’s one of those things where, to be able to get something like this passed in the very contentious environment that we find ourselves in, to me is a testament of the whole team.”
Lauren Brown, a postdoctoral researcher with SCI, said public support for the database has been positive, with many reaching out and notifying the institute about police misconduct they personally experienced or heard about.
To ensure an objective body can review the registry’s data and make evidence-based decisions on strategic objectives and entries, the institute will also launch the LEWIS Advisory Board, which will be composed of community and law enforcement stakeholders who are not involved in the day-to-day operations of SCI. 
“It is not so much about what Dr. Southers or Dr. Salinas or what I feel is important in terms of who might be eligible to be entered into the database, but what our colleagues and peers think, in their experience, given their perspectives and their expertise,” Brown said. “I think that we can build a collective body with various perspectives and experiences, and that just strengthens the credibility, the decisions of that governing body.”
As SCI prepares for the LEWIS registry to launch, Southers said he hopes the registry will play a role in changing police culture for the better and address the long history of police misconduct in the U.S., and will reflect well on John Lewis’s legacy.
“If you have an agency where officers are engaged in a certain kind of misconduct in 2021 and they were engaged in the same kind of misconduct 30 years ago, that’s a problem,” Southers said. “Those are the kinds of trends and patterns we want to look at. It’s time for the public to start holding agencies accountable for not making any progress, not making any changes and correcting the things that are wrong with them.”
