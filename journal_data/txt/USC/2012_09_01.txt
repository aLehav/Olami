USC’s explosive offensive wasted no time Saturday demonstrating its big-play potential.

On the first play from scrimmage, sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee snared a five-yard pass near the sideline, eluded an oncoming tackler and raced to the end zone for a 75-yard touchdown. No. 1 USC (1-0, 0-0), buttressed by Lee’s 10 receptions for 197 yards and an additional 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown, steamrolled Hawai’i 49-10 before an announced Coliseum sell-out of 93,607 fans.
“Today showed what I thought was going to happen with [Lee], just watching him from year one to year two,” Kiffin said. “He’s so much bigger and stronger now.… The first guy rarely ever tackles him.”
Lee, who at one point during the game seemed poised to challenge former wide receiver R. Jay Soward’s USC single-game record of 260 receiving yards, was quick to deflect praise, instead crediting his teammates with key blocks on both big plays and bemoaning a couple of dropped passes.
“You see [Lee] make cuts when people are coming to the side,” Kiffin said. “It’s why I think he’ll be the best one ever [at USC] when it’s all said and done.”
Though Kiffin praised Lee effusively, he also pointed out the budding star’s two dropped passes. The Trojans graded their offensive production as average, noting that the receiving corps dropped a couple of surefire receptions, and the running game, outside of junior running back Silas Redd’s 31-yard touchdown scamper, struggled to gain consistent yards.
USC running backs combined for 82 yards rushing on 23 attempts, a pedestrian 3.6 yards per rush. In his USC debut, Redd ran for 57 yards on nine carries and added a 19-yard reception, which he ultimately fumbled. His co-starter, senior running back Curtis McNeal, struggled to find his rhythm, finishing the game with 10 yards on five carries.
“It was bittersweet; I feel like we could have scored at least 100 points in the first half,” said senior quarterback Matt Barkley, who exited the game midway through the fourth quarter after completing 23 of 38 passes for 372 yards with four touchdowns and no interceptions.
On defense, USC nabbed two interceptions and recovered two fumbles, statistics that bode well for a defense that has stressed creating more turnovers this season. Sophomore linebacker Hayes Pullard recorded six tackles and returned an interception 27 yards for a touchdown.
“The storyline was the first-team defense and the defensive line,” Kiffin said.
Even without senior defensive end Wes Horton, who sat out with an undisclosed injury, USC’s defensive line — a unit in flux entering 2012 — provided consistent pressure, registering four sacks. Junior defensive end Morgan Breslin, who made his USC debut, headlined the effort in the trenches, forcing a fumble, recording a sack and leveling several hits on Hawai’i quarterback Sean Schroeder.
Freshman Leonard Williams also announced his readiness for Football Bowl Subdivision play, adding a sack of his own and jarring Schroeder on the pass attempt that Pullard ultimately intercepted.
“Our defensive linemen, they’re very young, but they come out there and play extremely fast,” Pullard said. “The safeties were playing better than ever. Everyone was talking [negatively] about our [defensive backs] and our defensive line; [they] just went out, executed the defense and played fast.”
Kiffin was not only happy to begin the season with the victory, but also pleased to use most of his roster, including 25 defenders. He hopes the playing time will benefit his inexperienced back-ups and prepare them for increased roles.
“Glad to be 1-0,” Kiffin said. “A lot of the teams in the country aren’t. We made it through the game relatively healthy and played a lot of players, which was good. Even before the game got out of hand, we were rotating a lot of guys in.… I’m excited to get to this film to see a lot of kids that haven’t played a lot.”

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Wednesday, Aug. 29 and Thursday, Aug. 30. 
Crimes against a person
At 3:48 a.m. on Aug. 30, two suspects approached a non-USC male from behind on the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Catalina Street. One of the suspects punched him in the face. The male fell to the ground and, while he lie there, one of the suspects removed his wallet from his pants pocket. The suspect then took the victim’s currency from the wallet and both suspects fled on foot. DPS officers responded and conducted a search, but were unable to locate the suspects.
Crimes against property
At 1:54 p.m. on  Aug. 29 a student reported that her laptop computer was removed from a bench in the lobby of the School of Cinematic Arts. A subsequent investigation by DPS and LAPD detectives revealed that the property was removed by a staff member. The detectives recovered the computer in the trunk of the staff member’s vehicle at her residence. The suspect was arrested and transported to 77th station for booking.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 1:39 a.m. DPS officers and LAFD Unit #15 responded to a report of smoke inside a room at Alpha Phi sorority. A subsequent check of the building revealed that the source of the smoke was a faulty air conditioning system. No fire was found and LAFD cleared the building for reentry.
At 12:22 a.m. on Aug. 30, currency, a check, a debit card and two IDs were found at Parking Lot 6 and turned in to DPS Lost & Found.
At 1:20 p.m. on Aug. 29, DPS officers responded to a report of a chemical spill in an operating room at the Keck Hospital of USC. Safety Office personnel also responded and cleaned up the spill without incident.

A former Los Angeles County appraiser allegedly provided thousands of dollars worth of impermissible benefits to two former USC student-athletes, according to a report released Saturday by the Los Angeles Times.
The Times, under the California Public Records Act, obtained emails from the Los Angeles County’s assessor’s office, suggesting that Scott Schenter provided former running back Joe McKnight a car and an airline ticket and former basketball forward Davon Jefferson roughly $3,700 in cash.
School officials told the Times they immediately reported the allegations to the NCAA and announced Saturday they will investigate the report as well.
“We have just learned of new allegations presented by a reporter from the Los Angeles Times,” USC Athletic Director Pat Haden wrote in a statement published on the school’s website. “We have discussed those allegations with the NCAA and Pac-12, and we will thoroughly investigate them and take any and all necessary actions.”
McKnight played for the Trojans from 2007-2009 before declaring for the NFL draft where he was selected in the fourth round by the New York Jets. Jefferson was at USC for one season, 2007-08, before similarly declaring for the NBA draft but was not taken in either round.
Though coming on the heels of a two-year postseason ban, USC still remains on probation following sanctions handed down by the NCAA in June 2010. As a result, it could be classified as a repeat violator should the NCAA determine McKnight and Jefferson did in fact receive improper benefits.
“I can personally assure you that USC takes its compliance obligations with NCAA and Pac-12 rules extremely seriously and we are dedicated to playing and competing the right way,” Haden added.
Schenter was first tied to McKnight in 2009 when the Times first reported McKnight had been seen driving a $27,000 Land Rover around the University Park Campus. The Land Rover had been listed under Schenter’s name. McKnight was then held out of the Trojans’ next game, the Emerald Bowl on Dec. 26, 2009 – a 24-13 win for USC over Boston College.
