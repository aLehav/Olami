NFC Championship Game Rewind
 
Former USC linebacker and current Green Bay Packer Clay Matthews earned his first trip to the Super Bowl after the Packers defeated the Chicago Bears 21-14 in the NFC Championship Sunday.
Known for their fierce defense all season, the Bears were able to contain Aaron Rodgers limiting him to just 244 yards passing and one rushing touchdown, while also forcing two interceptions.
But the Packers defense showed they were clutch in the end.
With a chance to tie the game, third string quarterback Caleb Hanie threw a ball toward the end zone, but it was intercepted by rookie cornerback Sam Shields.
A knee injury forced quarterback Jay Cutler to leave in the third quarter with his team trailing 14-0.
Backup Todd Collins came in to relieve Cutler, but was immediately pulled in favor of Hanie, who led two scoring drives and gave the Bears a chance to tie the game in the end until Shields interception.
The Packers are now second No. 6 seed in NFL history to reach the Super Bowl.
AFC Championship Game Rewind
The weather was as low as 13 degrees Sunday afternoon as the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Jets faced off in the 2011 AFC Championship game.
The NFL’s two stingiest defenses battled it out.
A lopsided first half saw the Steelers put up 24 points, while limiting the Jets to a field goal just before halftime.
The Steelers defense shut down the Jets running game in the first half, only allowing them 70 yards rushing.
But this game would be the tale of two halves.
Former USC quarterback and current Jet caller Mark Sanchez started slow, but almost led his team all the way back.
After the Jets recorded a safety, Sanchez hooked up with wide receiver Jerricho Cotchery to cut the lead to 24-19.
But Jets defense came up short in the end, as the Steelers managed to run out the clock.
The Jets are now 1-8 all time on the road against the Steelers (including playoffs).
The Steelers are now on their way to their eighth Super Bowl, and tie Dallas for most Super Bowl berths of all time.

Former USC tailback Stafon Johnson filed a lawsuit against USC in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Monday.
Johnson claimed negligence on behalf of former assistant strength coach Jamie Yanchar and the school related to a severe throat injury he sustained during a weightlifting accident in September 2009.
The other story · Johnson’s lawsuit alleges that a former USC assistant strength and conditiong coach is responsible for the severe throat injury he sustained during a mandatory team workout in September 2009. - Daily Trojan file photo 
Along with his mother, Kim Mallory, and attorney Carl Douglas, Johnson held a news conference Monday afternoon in Beverly Hills announcing the filing of a personal injury lawsuit against Yanchar and the university. During the gathering, he read from a prepared statement, while Douglas and Mallory answered questions from the media.
Seeking unspecified damages for medical-related expenses, pain and suffering and loss of potential earnings in excess of $25,000, the lawsuit alleges that Yanchar was not paying attention to Johnson at the time of the accident.
“Defendant Yanchar’s negligent, careless and reckless act and omission, in striking the bar with his body, was something that Mr. Johnson was not expecting to occur and he was therefore unprepared for the bar to be knocked off balance,” read the lawsuit.
In the aftermath, Johnson was forced to undergo several surgeries and therapy for injuries stemming from the incident.
On Sept. 28, 2009, Johnson dropped a barrel carrying 275 pounds of weight on himself while bench pressing in USC’s weight room during a mandatory team weight lifting session, causing serious injuries to his throat, and causing him to be hospitalized for approximately three weeks. He missed the remainder of the season.
The lawsuit, however, insists that Johnson did not drop the bar on his throat, as reports initially indicated.
“What we say occurred is that the bar was basically knocked out of his hand, causing it to fall on Stafon’s neck, almost causing him to die,” Douglas told reporters during Monday’s news conference. “We think for that, those that are responsible should be held responsible for their actions.”
Yanchar spent the last season with the NFL’s Seattle Seahawks, working for former USC coach Pete Carroll in a similar capacity. Two weeks after Carroll departed for the Seahawks, Yanchar was hired, leaving his position as interim strength coach.
“USC firmly believes it was not at fault in Stafon Johnson’s unfortunate weightlifting accident,” USC said in a statement released Monday afternoon. “We are sorry that Stafon was injured. USC and the entire Trojan Family have been exceptionally supportive of Stafon from the minute the accident occurred. We are disappointed to learn that Stafon has decided to file a lawsuit against USC.”

Report: Grimble might drop USC
Four-star defensive end Jalen Grimble (Las Vegas), cousin of USC tight end Xavier Grimble, is reportedly reconsidering his final college destination, despite committing to USC nearly nine months ago.
The Miami Herald’s Manny Navarro tweeted Monday afternoon that Grimble’s high school coach said he is leaning toward signing with Miami (Fl.) and dropping his commitment to USC, despite family ties.
The Hurricanes hired former Temple coach Al Golden in December, but their current class ranks just 47th nationally.
Grimble appeared USC-bound this past fall, but Scout.com presently lists him as a “soft verbal.”
“The first thing I loved about USC was the academics,” Grimble told Scout following his commitment last May. “It really means something, and you are lucky to be put in a position to be accepted and go to the school from an academic standpoint.
“The second thing I loved about the school is the tradition. The things they have accomplished [are] bar none better than any of the schools out there.”
The first day players can sign letter of intents to enroll at their school of choice is Feb. 2.

Martin stands by commitment
After rumors of a possible decommittment from USC, offensive guard Marcus Martin (Crenshaw, Calif.) reaffirmed his decision to stick with the Trojans.
“I’m still committed to USC,” Martin told WeAreSC.com.  “Make that clear.”
Since Martin committed last summer, he has not wavered in his decision to stick with the cardinal and gold.
His commitment seems all the more likely, especially after his visit to USC last weekend.
“I’m still committed to USC,” Martin told USCFootball.com. “They have an outstanding program and they look to be national champions in two years. They have a brand new facility coming and a great coaching staff. They’re experienced and seasoned with the same intensity as when coach [Pete] Carroll was there.”
Though Martin has given USC his word, the three-star recruit is still expected to make an official visit to Colorado this coming weekend.
Martin is ranked the 28th best player at his position, according to Rivals.com.
Thus far, the Trojans have 25 commits for the 2011 class, which ranks 5th in the nation.

USC women’s soccer adds assistant coach 
The Women of Troy welcome a new addition to their coaching staff, as P.J. Woolridge will be joining coach Ali Khosroshahin on the sidelines.
He will replace Harold Warren, who has taken a coaching job at Alabama-Birmingham.
Woolridge comes to USC after spending three seasons as an assistant at the University of San Diego, and eight seasons at Cal Poly.
“I’ve been competing against P.J. and his teams on the field and off since 2000,” Khosroshahin said of Woolridge. “I have a great deal of respect for what he was able to accomplish as a part of the staff at Cal Poly and at USD. P.J. is one of the hardest working assistants in the country.”
During his tenure as an assistant at Cal Poly, the Mustangs won four straight Big West championships and reached the NCAA Tournament five times.
Woolridge also helped coach the Toreros to three NCAA Tournament appearances during his time there.

UCLA reshuffles football staff 
According to Tracy Pierson of Scout.com’s BruinReportOnline, former Miami (Fl.) coach Randy Shannon has agreed to become UCLA’s new defensive coordinator, after Chuck Bullough was dismissed in December following the team’s 4-8 mark in 2010.
A source close to one of the Bruins’ recruits told Pierson that a UCLA coach called the recruit last night and told him that the deal for Shannon is done.
Other recruits have reportedly been told likewise.
Shannon compiled a 28-22 record in four years as the Hurricanes’ coach, but was fired in December following a disappointing 2010 season.
The Los Angeles Daily News UCLA beat writer John Gold, however, said he has heard conflicting reports from an assortment of players and parents.
The report comes after UCLA coach Rick Neuehisel formally introduced Mike Johnson as the team’s new offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach Sunday after Norm Chow was hired as the offensive coordinator at Utah.

Gilbreath: Led the Women of Troy in scoring during the team’s two-game road trip to the Bay Area. In Saturday’s loss to Stanford, Gilbreath scored 20 points and became the 22nd women’s player to reach 1,000 points for her career.
Troy: Led the No. 1 Trojans to two wins over No. 7 UC Irvine and No. 15 UC San Diego on the road. Troy has played an integral role this season in leading the team to its best start (4-0) since 1995.

On a mellow Monday in late September 2009, Stafon Johnson nearly died.
The senior USC running back was bench-pressing 275 pounds when the bar fell on his neck, crushing his throat. Johnson was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery and luckily, after hours under the knife, was in critical and stable position.
After a few more surgeries and endless hours of therapy, Johnson miraculously stepped onto the football field once more. Although he was not able to suit up for the Trojans again, he made an appearance in the Senior Bowl.
Although no team selected Johnson in the NFL draft, the Tennessee Titans signed Johnson the next day.
Johnson had not only cheated death, but he had overcome that freak accident to accomplish his dream of playing on Sundays. It was a feel-good story for the Trojan Family.
That is, until Monday, when Johnson filed a lawsuit against USC and former assistant strength coach Jamie Yanchar. Johnson is seeking unspecified damages.
Not such a feel-good story after all. Not when the lawyers get involved.
USCRipsit.com, the Trojans’ official blog, reported soon after the accident that Johnson was bench-pressing with a spotter when the bar unexpectedly slipped and fell on his neck. It was chalked up to an accident.
Turns out the details of that day are still in dispute. In a press conference Monday, Carl Douglas, Johnson’s lawyer, said the bar did not slip but was “knocked out” of the running back’s hands.
“What we say occurred is that the bar was basically knocked out of his hand, causing it to fall on Stafon’s neck, almost causing him to die,” Douglas said.
How exactly Johnson will prove that remains to be seen, but the ensuing legal struggle will be yet another black eye for USC.
Assuming Johnson is successful, USC could wind up paying for the money the running back would have received in the NFL had he not been injured.
Problem is, there is no way to scientifically determine how much Johnson’s stock fell because of the injury. It is hard to know whether Johnson would have been drafted even if the injury had not occurred.
He did not exactly put up breathtaking numbers at USC: 1,552 yards and 19 touchdowns while playing four years in USC’s crowded backfield. In 2008, his best season, he rushed for 705 yards and nine touchdowns.
But make no mistake, his lawyers will spew out a very lucrative number to cover the unspecified damages.
There is no doubt that Johnson was an inspiring Trojan who played with heart every snap. Doctors said that the injury to his neck would have probably been fatal if he was not already in such great physical shape. He was a vocal leader for the Trojans before the accident and a rallying cry of inspiration afterward.
“This lawsuit has not reduced in any way my love for the cardinal and gold,” Johnson said, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Nice try.
Johnson’s reputation, at least in the eyes of USC fans, will be irrevocably damaged. USC responded to the suit in a statement, maintaining, “it was not at fault” and was “disappointed” with the turn of events.
The university seemingly did everything in its power to help Johnson recover.
Maybe USC should cover all his medical expenses (Johnson said it covered only part of them), but anything beyond that makes Johnson appear to be bringing up an old grievance because his NFL career might not work out.
The timing of Johnson’s lawsuit seems odd, as well.
In another turn of bad luck, Johnson broke his fibula and sprained his ankle in a Titans preseason game. He was placed on injured reserve for the entire season.
Though Titans coach Jeff Fisher said he intends to bring Johnson back next season, there is no guarantee that he will.
According to the Los Angeles Times. Douglas said he had spoken to USC beforehand, but was forced to take legal action when the two sides could not find common ground. It is not clear when Douglas first approached USC.
To suggest that Johnson is filing this lawsuit now because his future in the NFL is on the ropes seems out of character for Johnson. But it does seem like a smart business move.
And maybe that’s what it comes down to. As we’ve been reminded so many times over the years, it’s all about the bottom line in the end.
But Johnson seemed better than that. Whenever I think back on his USC days, I’m reminded of the first time he spoke publicly after the accident. In a raspy, barely audible voice, Johnson repeated the words of his late grandfather: “God has a plan. Run Stafon, run.”
Instead of focusing on running again in the NFL, Johnson is running to the court room. And now that he is speaking again, he’s saying all the wrong things.

He doesn’t have any money and won’t make any in the NFL..

The trailer features a suspenseful and eerie opening of crinkling leaves, suspicious stares along with the wide-eye and innocent Valerie (Seyfried) saying, “The Wolf.”  As the conflict, chases, and famed werewolf hunter Father Solomon’s (Oldman) threats rise, so does the rush of techno music.
From the trailer, the movie seems to revolve around two stories, the first of which is a love triangle, where the beautiful Valerie must choose between the mysterious and hunky, orphan woodcutter, Peter (Fernandez) or the safe and wealthy Henry (Irons).
Second is a vicious and dangerous werewolf that seems to have a strange connection to Valerie.  Sound familiar?  Although loosely based on the Brothers Grimm’s fairy tale, “Little Red Riding Hood,” this Red Riding Hood is no longer little, but instead seems to veer on the sexy/teen angst/Twilight side.
And no surprise, Red Riding Hood’s director, Catherine Hardwicke, was also the director for the famed blockbuster that had every teen girl (and college student) fighting over either team Edward or team Jacob.
It’s Warner Bros hope that there still are a few who are willing to fight over the werewolf’s supremacy.

While Idol severely decreased in comparison to last season, it still did well enough to beat out other popular prime time programs.  Does this abrupt decline in Idol fever have to do with the deprivation of the painfully critical yet entertaining Simon Cowell?  Are A list stars like Steven Tyler and Jennifer Lopez not enough to account for Cowell’s absence?  Is there even still a place for music competitions on television?
Idol set the standard for reality show music competitions.  Just take a look at followers like The Sing-Off, America’s Got Talent, Don’t Forget the Lyrics! and so forth.  Idol created a phenomenon and it will always have a place in the heart of loyal American audience members.  Cowell was the core of American Idol given that everyone tuned in to see him exclaim those brutal, sadistic criticisms.
Tyler and Lopez, however, do have a lot to offer as charismatic judges who are actually spot on with their advice; they don’t simply cover up their critiques with unrelated flattery like the spacey Paula Abdul.  After the success of megastars like Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood, the show is sure to strive for future similar successes.  In addition, viewers will likely stay faithful provided that the show weeds out the likes of the untalented Justin Guarini, Sanjaya Malakar and of course the infamous Clay Aiken.  Idol will predictably return to its original status and regenerate high viewership so long as talented musicians continue to audition.
Fingers crossed for the next flamboyant Adam Lambert or the fabulous, Oscar-winning Jennifer Hudson.

For many starting student bands, Ground Zero Performance Café is one of the places to be to get your music out to a variety of fans.
Ground Zero radiated a relaxed atmosphere Saturday night for the Murder at the Well concert.
To start the show, opening act Carl Grey sat onstage with Murder at the Well’s drummer, who played the bongos with him for the first few songs. Grey looked perfectly at home in the dimness of the milkshake hub. The lighting was simple and warm, and Grey, clad in a fedora and vest, added to the SoCal calm of the beginning of the evening.
Matthew Wunderlich | Daily Trojan
Grey’s songs were both upbeat and intense, a kind of Jack Johnson sound mixed with a Smashing Pumpkins edge.
Smooth guitar strumming paired with the eclectic bongos soothed the audience in the first few songs, while a simply earnest message was heard especially in the song “Sweet Girl.” Grey’s performance was genuine, and a mellow song dedicated to his father rounded out his set with a similar vibe.
Murder at the Well took the stage after a short break, and didn’t hesitate to completely alter the tone of the concert. The café went dark and was forcefully lit with bright, white light as heavy guitar riffs shook the floor. The band members threw themselves into the music with pounding drums and lightning-fast bass riffs.
The band’s power was a combination of the skilled instrumentals, reflecting an overwhelmingly metal sound, and smooth vocals that carried well over the escalating passion and volume.
This clarity sets Murder at the Well apart from other wannabe metal bands. The audience could feel influences of rock in the music, with soulful lyrics and impressive projection. There was no jumbled confusion or unintelligible vocals buried beneath overpowering guitar and bass.
Lead singer and bassist Dave Tomkins’ vocals had a similar tone to that of Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, a bluesy sound mixed with the gritty influence of heavy metal, with a similar unyielding power and projection. The mixture of genres made the music accessible to blues, metal and rock fans.
Though a powerful, heavy metal performer, Tomkins is also a lecturer for USC’s beloved Writing 140 program. It’s initially difficult to picture this black T-shirt-clad singer lecturing in front of students, but the care Tomkins puts into his lyrics and his performance reflects this intelligence. His impressive energy and intensity throughout the performance kept the audience glued to the band’s set.
The band played from its self-titled debut album Murder at the Well, proving its ability to dabble in a variety of textures and genres with the sampling of tracks. On one extreme, screaming guitar riffs paired with flashing strobes and blindingly yellow lights carried the dark, coarse “Night & Day”, overtaking the small venue.
On the other, “Up High” proved to be a more mainstream mix of metal and rock, with escalating arpeggio lines and layering of guitar, bass and drums.
Murder at the Well kept up the pace of the show without much interaction with the audience. The band members played off one another; guitarist Reza Moosavi and drummer Mike Dorado were key to the continuing balance and endurance of the performance. Dorado was constantly pounding forcefully at his drums, Moosavi filling in silences with the vibrating sounds of electric guitar.
The audience and venue were small, but Murder at the Well brought a power better suited for somewhere like the Music Box. This band brings a sound suited for a large, packed crowd that can fall into the intensity of the music.
It’s highly recommended to anyone who wants to hear a unique combination of smooth, melodic lines with intense metal lines.
Nice review, however the openers name was Carl Gray with an “A”, and his song mentioned above is ” Street Girl” not “Sweet Girl”. All in all it was a good show and decent review.

Following three Golden Globe wins last week, an Entertainment Weekly cover story and a much-hyped post-Super Bowl return on Feb. 6, it would seem that Glee is at the top of its game.
And that might be true in terms of accolades, press and fandom, but lately the show’s episodes have failed to meet the hype. Despite the popularity garnered by the idea of a show about covering popular songs, we are left to wonder about the quality of the show as whole.
Before I offend any hardcore Gleeks, I must admit my own devotion to the show. Or rather, to the show’s first season. There have always been problems with Glee but the show is undeniably likable. Glee has won over both critics and viewers alike with its charm and fun musical numbers. It’s the kind of show that just puts a smile on your face.
Glee used to be able to overcome many of its problems, because of Finn’s affecting smile and Rachel’s mind-blowing belt. But in the second season, the problems have grown out of control, leaving only a handful of redeeming qualities behind.
Last season had some engrossing, albeit ridiculous, story arcs that were maintained throughout much of the season. Terri, the wife of glee club director Will Schuester pretended to be pregnant while Will struggled with his feelings for guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury. Emma, of course, had a major crush on him. Classic teenage drama was well represented through head cheerleader Quinn’s scandalous pregnancy and the love triangle with her boyfriend Finn and baby-daddy Puck.
Though the stories seemed silly, they were engaging and lasted long enough for us to form an attachment to the characters and care about their problems.
But in the second season, the characters’ stories, relationships and problems start and end so quickly that we are left with little time to invest in our once beloved cast. Tina and Mike’s relationship, for instance, was introduced in the first episode with no justification other than their common Asian ethnicity. And what about her and Artie? Their romance was sweetly spread out over the first season, but their breakup was relegated to a mere flashback.
Speaking of underdeveloped romances, shallow cheerleaders Santana and Brittany share an entirely inexplicable makeout scene. When Santana blows Brittany off later in the same episode, Brittany tries to make Santana jealous by having sex with Artie. After this episode, the Santana/Brittany pairing is never pursued again.
There is one story line with some power — that of gay student Kurt. In the wake of a number of gay teen suicides last fall, the show’s focus on anti-gay bullying has  brought Glee tons of media attention, most of which has been positive. Actor Chris Colfer won a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Kurt. Colfer’s moving performances are perhaps the only thing left that anchors the show in some kind of reality.
What gave Glee serious potential from the beginning was always the music.
Perhaps the first wave of Gleeks consisted primarily of theater and a cappella kids who loved to hear their favorite show tunes and pop songs sung by Broadway stars such as Lea Michele and Matthew Morrison.
Theater veteran guest stars including Idina Menzel, Kristin Chenoweth and Neil Patrick Harris have continued to set a high bar in terms of vocal performance.
In the first season, the New Directions’ a capella-esque arrangement of Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’” made something original out of a classic and, whether you liked it or not, Michele and Menzel put an innovative spin on Lady Gaga’s “Poker Face” by slowing it down and injecting emotional resonance into the story of the song.
Now, however, Glee’s writers seem to have changed their focus to squeezing in as many current hits as possible into the episodes, including Jay-Z’s “Empire State of Mind” and Travie McCoy’s “Billionaire” in the first episode and Cee Lo Green’s disappointingly censored “Forget You” and two Bruno Mars singles later in the season.
But the most disappointing part of this new season is the fact that the actors are doing little more than singing karaoke. The characters are only imitating the original, singing over radio tracks. There are no interesting arrangements, and unless one of the few remarkably talented singers is performing, the use of auto-tune limits the capacity of any of the musical numbers to really blow you away.
There have been some good moments this season, many of them revolving around a handful of standout songs, but the potential demonstrated in the endearingly unique first season is all but gone.
Despite my complaints, I’ll be watching come Feb. 6. I’m just hoping Glee will have undergone some major corrective surgery by then.

Your article is SO WRONG. Glee this season has been great!!!!!!
i everything want you see go to ready love you keep yourself said hot sex 90 vh1 joy watkins pokemon red and blue versions nintendo gameboy pikachu mewtwo charizard jigglypuff gyarados onix lapras omastar kabutops and aerodactyl.
Completely agree!  This season feels so different from the first (in a disappointing way.)  I guess it’s realistic for people to be breaking up and switching love interests faster than you can blink but a good TV show requires some steady relationships (whether those are friendships or romantic.)
…and the music… what happened to covering classics and songs that are ‘under the radar.?’   I think they’re trying to bring in the young audience by using every song that’s on the radio.   A few new songs are okay but I liked it better when they ‘revived the classics’ with a unique touch.  Even when they weren’t that old (example:  My Life Would Suck Without You) they weren’t so recent they’re being heard constantly.
Anyway, I agree with the article completely!  Stick with a story line, develop some relationships throughout it and stop being the radio.
And one last thing, Why is it okay for everyone (even Mr. Schuester) to bully Rachel but not Kurt?
Could not disagree with this article more! I really believe that Glee is what TV and teens need right now. With all the trash on tv and kids being bullied, teens need a place to go where they can see a bit of themselves. What I love maybe the most about glee though is the music. The variety they put out is amazing and I can honestly say that I always find myself liking the glee verison better. They need a mix of old and new songs from all different genres, that’s what makes them Glee!!!!
Do you remember your high school days? Kids paired off and broke up constantly. That was just how it was. And as far as the guest stars, i think they add a little somethin’ to the mix..new voices that make for an interesting show. Gwenyth Paltrow’s version of ‘Forget you’ was funny, entertaining and just plain fun! Neil Patrick Harris blew me away, as did Kristin Chenowith. And  Idina Menzel’s duet with Lea Michelle, well, that was breathtaking. And Chris Colfer’s portrayal of a gay teen bullied by the football player is heartwrenching, as was his scenes with his onscreen father, Mike O’Malley. The show is 43 minutes of fun. And I enjoy every minute of it. And, since I am no longer a teen, in fact I could be a mom to any one of the cast members, I think that says it all.
Um… HELLO the acapella version of Teenage Dream is not  “karaoke singing over radio tracks”. Also they’ve done a bunch of mash-ups so it’s pretty offending for you to call their covers a karaoke version. Billionaire & Forget You were great on their own because the people singing put their own flair into those songs.
I <3 glee.
Something happened to Glee — everybody started liking it. In it’s first season, Glee became an instant classic for me, captivating me with its surprising, charmingly-unrealistic plot, it’s flawed but empathetic characters, for whom it seemed that whatever the plot’s outcome were unlikely to be fully fulfilled, and the music (even though it was more auto-tuned than needed for so many veteran performers) was varied and stood out from the original which it covered.
But now, most of what I enjoyed about Glee is gone. Focus has shifted from maintaining an overall plot arch to providing a quick set up for another A-list celebrity to make a brief appearance. What once was a fantastical but still ringing true to life portrayal of high school outsiders has turned into an unbelievable tale of how every student must be paired off into unpredictable and unlikely couples that will fizzle and reform every few episodes. The music selections seem to be made based on what is most likely to sell on iTunes than on what fits the story the best.
I’ll keep watching, because every few episodes (such as in Duets), I see a glimmer of the Glee that used to be. I hope things will change. But, given that this Glee is the one that attracts the most viewers, I don’t see the show going back any time sonn.
“Disappointingly censored” ? Did you REALLY expect the Cee Lo number to be the UNCENSORED version on Glee?
This is so true, the show has been a disappointment lately. They really need to develop and work with a few relationships that last throughout the show, instead of having everyone date each other as fast as possible. I miss the old Glee :(

Jamil Khoury, director of the Silk Road Theatre Project, conceived something dynamic.
Playwrights typically develop and enrich their fictional characters, but Khoury decided to have them open themselves to something more personal.
Weird science · The DNA Trail explores a variety of relatable themes ranging from questions of identity to relationships with family members. -  Photo courtesy of Amanda Vevers 
He had seven playwrights from diverse backgrounds each take a genealogical DNA test, and from those tests flourished seven short, unique plays that showcase the playwright’s personal ideas of ethnicity, identity and human relationships.
Some of the cast members had worked on The DNA Trail before, and while not every actor was involved in each play, they all portrayed multiple characters.
The series starts with Finding Your Inner Zulu by Elizabeth Wong, a story centered around a young woman who fears that she won’t be able to go pro in basketball because she’s too short, and so desires to alter her genes to make herself taller.
This piece, although rough and imperfect, is still humorous. It also requires audience members to use their imaginations as the characters are taken on an entertaining trip through DNA strands.
Many of the works in the performance focus on family and close relationships and manage to stir up a variety of emotions.
Mother Road by Velina Hasu Houston, focuses on two long-lost half sisters who reconnect after losing their respective families. The work delves into issues such as abandonment, death and the psychological and physical effects of breast cancer, issues which make this play feel much more personal than the last. It’s dramatic, somber and well-acted.
Lina Patel’s That Could Be You continues the family trend by centering around two couples, one having a baby and the other planning to adopt that baby. What if they switched places? What if their genes were different?
This piece plays off the idea that the base pairs made up of adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine can result in all kinds of people. Patel succesfully combines genetics and adoption for a poignant scene.
The focus on differing personalities and the concept of identity continue into the final play in Act I.
WASP: White Arab Slovak Pole by Khoury, tells the story of a mixed race young man named Jamil, who, as the title implies, has Arabic as well as European roots.  
The play explores the character’s struggles with being accepted on his own terms as he clashes with diverse characters.
The first characters he comes in contact with claim that he doesn’t “look like a Jamil,” to which Khoury replies, “What does a Jamil look like?”
Jamil is confronted by ignorance from all sides, from people who think he is phony for trying to deny that he is white, to people who question his religious affiliations, and even by a man who criticizes him for speaking poor Arabic.
The play is witty, hilarious and confronts all-too-common ignorance in a manner that gets the point across without being preachy. WASP is easily the most entertaining piece in the entire series.
The second act creates a more downcast attitude. With the exception of the sixth play, Act II takes on a more somber note.
Bolt from the Blue by Shishir Kurup, is told primarily through a series of long distance conversations that track one man’s depression and schizophrenia and his cousin’s deep-seated fear that those mental illnesses might spread to him.
A Very DNA Reunion by David Henry Hwang lightens the mood with an interesting plot.
A young slacker concerned with Halo and the like, finds himself sitting in his room with a few of his ancient ancestors: Cleopatra, Genghis Khan and an awesome ninja, after paying a ridiculous amount of money for an unreliable DNA test with his parents’ credit card.
The series ends with Child is Father to Man by Philip Kan Gotanda, a touching monologue about a man’s reflection on family, death and his own personal growth as his father lays dying.
There were a number of humorous plays in the collection, but Khoury ends with this intimate, poignant piece, perhaps signaling the significance and purpose of this entire project.
Having seven living playwrights working together on a single project, yet maintaining the uniqueness of their own pieces, was a daring thing to do.
Though The DNA Trail has a few flaws, Khoury’s project is quite successful.
The actors were skilled and seemed in touch with their numerous characters, while the plays themselves utilize humor and drama to explore the many facets of DNA and genetics through topics such as family relationships, ethnicity, religion, adoption, mental disease and self.
We had an amazing time performing THE DNA TRAIL at USC.  You guys rock!  The best –and largest– audience ever! Thank you!

Corinne Bailey Rae’s breathy and relaxing vocals first caught the music world’s eye when EMI Records released her self-titled album in March 2006. Hits like “Put Your Records On” made her listeners want to drive down the Pacific Coast Highway in an open convertible. “Like a Star” made her fans yearn for a rainy day to sit and melt away with the smooth blend of jazz and pop.
Strange melodies · The album consist of covers from iconic artists such as Paul McCartney and Bob Marley but fails to bring out the unique characteristics that first brought Corinne Bailey Rae to music fame. - Photo courtesy of EMI Music 
In 2008, she took home a Grammy for Album of the Year  and contributed to Herbie Hancock’s River: The Joni Letters which won Best Contemporary Jazz Album.
The Love EP features a collection of five cover songs, including Rae’s recent digital single, “Is This Love.”
Although the collection of covers features songs by legendary artists, much of Rae’s honestly soulful writing found in her last album, The Sea, is lost. The album only consists of her singing already established classic songs.
The EP opens with a playful cover of Prince’s 1979 hit “I Wanna Be Your Lover.” True to the original, the song features a base of a funky synth, rhythmic tune. In what seems to be an effort to mimic Prince’s quirky high falsetto, Rae’s unique and laid back voice is instead strung out to sound like a mere imitation.
The second cover is a rendition of the early ’90s rock and slightly punk song “Low Red Moon,” by Belly. A strong and distorted electric guitar riff, an unusual opening for Rae, gives way to her haunting voice, where throughout the song a back-up vocalist can be heard whispering and repeating the words after she sings. Her wistful vocals provide a new and current appeal to Belly’s song, but it still lacks Rae’s fresh and unique writing talent that has impressed her listeners over the last two albums.
The single “Is This Love,” which was released on Sept. 21, 2010 and is perhaps one of the songs most clearly distinguishable from the original version. The cover is an obvious rendition of the song sung by the classic reggae artist Bob Marley, but Rae adds a blues twist. Played in what seems to be a slower or more sedate rhythm in three-quarters time, along with Rae’s calming voice, the song could make a perfectly romantic waltz.
“My Love,” a No. 1 hit in 1973 by Paul McCartney and Wings, is another cover that is included in The Love EP. The track starts out with little more than Rae’s voice and the rhythmic picking and strumming of an acoustic guitar, displaying her ability to hold her listener’s attention with merely her soothing voice.
The potential for another artistic version of Paul McCartney’s hit is disrupted in the middle of the track, when an out of place synthesizer, sounding almost as if it came out of Disney’s Main Street electrical parade, disrupts the smooth flow of the song. Missing the mark, Rae falls into a musical category far below McCartney’s.
The final cover on the EP is a live version of the song “Que será, será,” made famous in the mid ’50s by Doris Day and later by the ’70s band, Sly and the Family Stone. Rae and her band fuse together the classic, soft lullaby with the powerful and wailing pleads of the blues.
Raw emotion is voiced behind the famous lyrics, Que será, será, Whatever will be, will be, blending together a certain contentment with life along with a bitter anger over fate. This authentic and passionate tone has the potential to be a hit under the name of something other than its previous singers.
One thing’s for certain — the album will draw a wide audience just because of the renowned artists and songs she covers. The nostalgic memories conjured up by lyrics like, And when I go away / I know my heart can stay with my love, will give many fans a reason to listen to The Love EP.
But the disappointment still remains that although these songs might be a nice and heartfelt homage to some of Rae’s and the world’s favorite artists, the EP lacks the originality that would make it a truly worthwhile buy.
In the end, it’s a waste of Rae’s talent to devote a whole EP covering songs that have already topped the charts, rather than her own songs.
The classics are already classic.
How can even a talented artist like Rae overcome that?
your an idiot. corinne is amazing.

Anyone who’s walked The Row or visited the University Village will tell you that the area has a problem with homelessness.
There seems to be endless debate about whether this is really a university issue or if it would be better handled by the city of Los Angeles. But the fact remains that it needs to be dealt with.
Homelessness is a major problem in the city of Los Angeles and especially in the area around USC. | Creative Commons
It’s unrealistic to assert that our campus should be wiped clean of panderers, but an alternative can certainly be achieved by those with the authority to effect positive change.
It would help USC’s reputation to be proactive about solving the homeless issue around campus, and would help students feel more secure.
An employment commission could improve our community relations. Our nation’s unemployment rate is currently 10 percent, so this method could help everyone in Los Angeles, not just the homeless.
Though Los Angeles runs on a tight budget, it is vital to aid those who are at least looking to contribute to an ailing economy. The last thing our legislators and employers can do is to leave those looking to better their lives in the dust.
And that’s where USC comes in. Our university is the largest private employer in the region. Surely, our campus has a tremendous impact on the success, or struggles, of our local economy.
There could be a system put in place by the university that helps people find jobs that are low-requisite, entry-level positions that aren’t too demanding, but provide a steady income.
With leading professional studies in business, public policy and community relations, USC has the firepower necessary to put theory to work by fueling job creation and higher standards of living for those who desperately need our help.
Already, USC has proven successful in improving the quality of life for those in surrounding neighborhoods.
But we cannot stop there, not when homelessness still looms large on the streets of Figueroa and Jefferson.
We must take initiative so that the homeless can return the favor.
With the right kind of promotion, the homeless might take the initiative to seek those jobs and use the public programs to their benefit. And if we put friendly, likable people in charge of recruitment, they could certainly earn the trust of homeless people and convince them to better their lives.
I know it’s idealistic. I’m very well aware that there are deeply rooted issues that lead to homelessness.
We can, and must, take charge and do something about a social issue that USC clearly has the resources to confront.
Clinton VanSciver is  an undeclared sophomore. 
Typical of USC. I put in a negative comment about the homeless around here and that they dont want help. They only want your money for their next crack fix. Of course I put those comments in and they wont let it post.
oh wait now it shows up with the “your comment is awaiting moderation”
What & where is THE ROW & University Villiage? Remember that us readers know nothing except what you tell us.
And what makes you think that people who are obviously too lazy and/or inept to find a job at a McDonald’s just down the road are going suddenly feel motivated to work for one located within the walls of USC? The school’s only responsibility to to students, and the parents who pay their tuition, by focusing on cutting-edge resources and providing the best possible opportunities for the next generation of Trojans
“Our university is the largest private employer in the region. Surely, our campus has a tremendous impact on the success, or struggles, of our local economy.”
Is it fair to call the university the largest private employer in the region, when it’s only the largest in the city of L.A.?
This isn’t idealistic in the least.  We should be forcing USC to live up to its  “Good Neighbor” proclamations all the time.  However, these types of actions shouldn’t be taken unilaterally, but with constant input and influence from local community organizations even though USC has a notorious history of flatly ignoring their concerns.

Clean energy has long enjoyed a fairly positive public image. Vague notions that it’s impractical or expensive are generally dispelled by the assurance that it’s the key to our future, will keep our planet healthy, etc.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
In recent weeks, however, there’s been an influx of negative publicity for certain forms of clean energy. Fox News happily promoted the inefficiency of electric cars while The Wall Street Journal led a combination expose/crusade against wind energy.
The Washington Examiner also jumped on the tar-and-feathering of the wind turbine, while the generic rumblings that solar power is too expensive got a little louder. Passionate defenses of the electric car and company have poured forth in return, cropping up across the Internet from personal blogs to National Geographic.
Understandably, there’s been some confusion.
It would be easy to brush aside all the criticism with the blanket excuse that conservatives simply badmouth clean energy because they have other priorities. In some cases, this might be true. In others, they’ve actually made some valid points.
ELECTRIC CARS
This is the green initiative that has recently come under the most fire, thanks in part to an Energy Policy paper. The paper contends that in countries already saddled with high levels of CO2, like China, battery powered vehicles have a greater carbon footprint than your standard Hyundai. The publicity that followed got somewhat carried away, claiming that BPVs might actually speed global warming.
The absurdity that allowed the blog to be picked up by everyone from Red Dog Report to Fox News is a little unsettling. The criticism discounted both the significant carbon offsets that electric cars provide in other areas of the world and the fact that they can still be effective in heavily-polluted countries.
Investing in an electric car ultimately comes down to whether or not it’s worth it to you personally. They’re expensive, you can’t buy them used and their safety is somewhat unproven. On the other hand, they’re easily maintained and can come with tax credits in the realm of $7,500.
A BPV’s batteries need to charge for anywhere from six to 12 hours each night, but if we can incorporate our cell phone, iPod, laptop and camera chargers into our daily lives, we can probably work our way around one more.
WIND ENERGY
The Journal’s beef with wind energy had to do with taxpayers kicking in more than they should have to, and with “impatient Democrats” raiding the loans associated with wind energy for other endeavors.
It’s not improbable that the Obama administration’s clean energy budget has its kinks to work out. But that doesn’t entirely discount wind turbines from the clean energy equation.
Wind energy as a whole is not inordinately expensive; according to a 2008 Congressional Research Service report, the price tag is comparable to that of natural gas or coal, and in some cases it’s actually a cheaper alternative.
The problem with wind energy, aside from whatever current pork-barrel scandal is making its way through Congress’ version of the tabloids, is its inconsistency. Without a breeze to ruffle the smog, turbines wouldn’t keep a single city block of Los Angeles going. Given a strong wind, however, the worst that can really be said about turbines is that they’re noisy and might off the occasional passing bird.
SOLAR ENERGY
It’s not a fix-all. Solar panels can run more than $1000 a pop, and they don’t work well in pollution. They’re still fairly efficient, though, and the expense seems clearly worth it in the long run. But they’re not necessarily feasible everywhere; attempting to make them a prominent source of energy in downtown Los Angeles, where you can ask for a smog check with your car wash, might actually not be worth the hassle.
Still, solar energy is an incredibly promising medium for areas in which the panels would function well. And the more we invest in them, the cheaper they’ll eventually become.
Clean energy has its problems — we knew that before Energy Policy told us.
On the whole, the negative publicity isn’t much of a revelation. We know clean energy is expensive, that it can be unreliable and that our government has a long way to go before we could use it on par with natural gas or coal.
That simply leaves us to decide which forms of clean energy, and at what cost, can be efficiently implemented.
The same decisions we’ve been making for years.

Booooooooooorrrrrrrring….Yawn
Yes. This is exactly the kind of thought that needs to go into clean energy AND government taxes, welfare, traditional energy- we need to start being conscious all across the board.
