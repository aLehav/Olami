The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety daily incident log on Wednesday, Jan. 11.
Crimes against a person
at 9:43 p.m., a suspect approached a non-USC male from behind and hit him in the back of the head with an unknown object. The male fell to the ground and while he lay there the suspect removed an MP3 player and a pair of headphones from his jacket pocket. The suspect then fled on a bicycle. DPS officers responded and conducted a search, but were unable to locate the suspect. The male sustained a cut to the back of his head and was treated by an LAFD R.A. unit.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 9:01 p.m., an RA reported that he observed approximately 30 students and open containers of alcohol inside a dorm room at Elisabeth von Kleinsmid Residence Hall. The students fled when the RA asked for their IDs and DPS officers were requested. None of the students were identified, but the RA stated that the residents of the room will be cited to the Student Judicial Affairs.
at 5:19 p.m., a staff member reported that a non-USC male who filled out an online survey for the School of Architecture included an incoherent message that made reference to the track and field team. The message was not considered threatening.
at 3:37 p.m., DPS officers responded to a report of a chemical spill in a lab on the second floor of the location.  Safety Office personnel also responded and determined that the chemical was a powdered cleaning solution.  The chemical was then cleaned up without further incident.
at 1:12 p.m., DPS officers responded to a report of two students involved in a dispute outside Jack in the Box and detained them for investigation. Both subjects said the argument was verbal only and the officers observed no signs of injuries. The officers then transported the students to their residence.

USC students have expressed disappointment after the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials announced Jan. 9 that they have just now entered the final phase of testing for a portion of the new Expo Line, which has stations running near USC.
Running late · The Expo Line, which will eventually provide rail service from Santa Monica to Culver City, has been delayed again because of technical malfunctions. - Aoyang Wang | Daily Trojan
Brad Sutton, a senior majoring in architecture, said the Expo Line would have been convenient for his summer job in Venice Beach.
“I worked in Venice last summer and the [Expo Line] would have been perfect,” Sutton said. “I won’t be able to take advantage of [the Expo Line] but it will be nice for students to use it to go to the beach or Culver City and not have to drive.”
This announcement comes after the discovery of technical problems with the line during the previous testing period in September and October. In one situation, trains were unable to pass through a junction where the Blue Line meets the Expo Line because of a signaling malfunction. In addition, MTA encountered ventilation problems in a trench near USC where two trains are meant to run underground.
These set backs have been resolved, but the testing period has been extended, MTA spokesperson Rick Jager said.
“We want to ensure the system is safe and reliable before we open it up to the public,” Jager said.
He said that within the next few months, MTA will run trains on the Expo Line from Downtown Los Angeles to Culver City. Though no official date has been set for the line to open, phase one of the line will be complete early this year.
USC Director of Transportation Tony Mazza said MTA sends out regular notices to university officials about ongoing testing. MTA has also provided safety ambassadors at areas where the Expo Line runs near the university to ensure that no cars or people accidentally enter the track.
Mazza said USC Transportation will suspend operation of the LA Live Shuttle once the Expo Line opens but will continue to offer the shuttle system off campus, on campus, and between campus and Union Station.
Nastassia Andari, a graduate student studying global communication, said if the Expo Line proved to be cost saving, she would take advantage of the Expo Line.
“If there was something available that would be more cost-effective, I would be open to that.” Andari said. “I wasn’t expecting the Metro would be opening and running by the time I was [still] living here.”
The Expo Construction Authority, the builders of the Expo line, broke ground in September for phase two, which will extend the line to Santa Monica. Phase two is expected to be complete in 2015.
Just in case anyone is not clear, they have started pre-revenue testing which generally lasts 2-3 months which is the final testing phase in which they basically just run the train regularly (as they have been doing) but more frequently to get everyone used to the trains running as often as they will when public passengers ride it. Nothing will hold the train up from opening by early April at this point unless something technically breaks and requires fixing.
I did a little calculation and figured that the San Francisco Bay Bridge (all 7-10 miles and 3 bridges and one tunnel and ten lanes of it) would cost $1.5 billion in today’s dollars.
@John McNary   The kind of idiot who thinks that building an eight mile light rail line on an existing rail right-of-way should take less than 6 1/2 years. It’s not like there’s any paradigm shift involved here. It’s just a trolley.
this Story Is A Joke Useing Dated Info and dose not have Facts Corect the Workers on Phase-1 where also Union Workers this must be writen by some one tha has no clue to what is realy going On the Tracks for Blue-Expo have been now used for the Last 2-Weeks and trains are also now running the full line
So many facts in this article are wrong, it’s ridiculous.
(If it’s any solace, at least the Phase 2 Expo Line workers are unionized, paid a fair wage, and allowed safety precautions.)
To echo what Joe said, the Transcontinental Railroad would cost around $800 million in today’s money. The Expo Line is already pushing $900 million. Hmm.
They used Chinese workers making 10 cents a day. Thousands were killed or maimed. The railroad companies were given vast tracts of land along the rails to subsidize the transcontinental trains. What kind of idiots are USC training here?
Cabinet members in a future Nixon administration.
The transcontinental railroad was built in 6 years but on the backs of minorities (Largely Chinese, African American, Irish, Homosexuals and Transgendered persons) at a huge cost to their respective communities.   Is that what you are suggesting we should use as a model for our modern public transportation system?  I say NO to your obvious bigotry!
I remember when they first started working on the line, when I was a freshman in 2005. Now here we are 6 years later and it still isn’t open. For comparison, the transcontinental railroad was complete in 6 years without the benefit of modern technology. Your tax dollars [not] at work.

Activities should be made available to students especially during exams, students are encouraged to continue to eat right, get rest and find healthy ways to deal with stress, one of which is exercise, however during exam time, USC limits access to PE facilities. This is at a time they should be staying open or increasing hours.

A new USC-produced card game offers high school students an innovative way to prepare for college.
Application Crunch, a game produced by the Center for Higher Education Policy Analysis at the USC Rossier School of Education in partnership with USC’s Game Innovation Lab, uses simple rules to teach students the strategy of applying to college.

The game is now available in the Pertusati University Bookstore  and at collegeologygames.com. The website also includes the option of donating a game to a local school.
Players start the game with an assigned role, such as a student with average grades looking for a scholarship, and have to make a series of choices to help that student achieve their goals.
William Tierney, director of CHEPA, said the center developed Application Crunch to give low-income students “access to higher education, a mentoring program and a writing program to help them get into college and be better prepared for college.”
Though many college preparatory programs are available, Tierney said few are affordable enough for low-income or first-generation college students.
“If you think about poor schools, we’ve got most of the kids as first- generation college applicants,” Tierney said. “And then they’re in schools where there are very few of their peers going to college and they often don’t have adequate advising.”
Tierney first realized the need for a program of this kind three years ago, when he approached then-Provost C. L. Max Nikias for a grant. With university funding, Rossier brought USC’s Game Innovation Lab onto the project and chose the name Collegeology Games.
Graduate students in Rossier’s Ph.D. and research programs also helped develop the game.
Post-doctoral research associate Zoë Corwin worked on research and development for Application Crunch and said the key to the game is its strategy.
“If you are role-playing and you are picking the stakes and learning strategy, like, ‘I need to be on top of my deadline and get good grades to get into college,’ you learn so much more,” Corwin said.
Collegeology Games conducted focus groups in L.A. high schools and compiled statistics from national surveys to make Application Crunch as relevant to students as possible. Tierney said Rossier has continued to conduct more research on the most efficient ways to teach students.
“We’re at a university, [so] we are concerned about not just creating a game but creating a game that can be valid and reliable,” Tierney said. “We’re constantly doing research to make sure the learning is as [maximized] as possible.”
Following the success of Facebook applications like FarmVille and Family Feud, Collegeology Games hopes to launch a Facebook version of the game in March to reach more high school students.
“Imagine how you would respond to someone lecturing you about college versus a game with social networking that’s fun. Information is good, but it has to be fun for kids to get interested,” Corwin said. “That’s why this game is working so well.”

California Sen. Alex Padilla proposed a bill this week that would require NCAA universities to guarantee that student-athletes currently on scholarship retain their financial aid through graduation, regardless of injury and time needed to complete degree requirements. USC currently guarantees the provisions of the bill to athletes on scholarship.
“Academics are paramount and the vast majority of athletes here understand that they will need that college degree,” USC men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill said. “USC is ahead of the curve.”

The bill mandates all colleges earning $10 million or more in broadcast revenues to continue supporting athletes on scholarship who have exhausted their athletic eligibility but still need time to graduate. Athletes on full scholarships would keep those scholarships until they earn a college degree, even if their athletic eligibility expires.
“USC takes care of its athletes,” said Abe Markowitz, a senior majoring in urban planning and development and an offensive lineman on scholarship for the USC football team. “Coaches work around your academic schedule so athletes can be as successful off the field as they are on the field.”
Markowitz sat out the 2010 season because of a foot injury while receiving a full scholarship.
Ramogi Huma, a former UCLA linebacker and president of the National College Players Association, calls Padilla’s legislation a student-athlete “bill of rights.” Huma said he expects graduation rates to skyrocket if the bill becomes law.
“There are no excuses, nowhere to run or hide,” Huma said. “The federal graduation rates for football and basketball are the worst at 50 percent, and only 2 percent of the athletes actually go pro, so getting that college degree is important and this bill will definitely help with that.”
According to a NCAA study published last October, student-athletes’ six-year graduation rates are at a record high in nearly every sport, hovering around 80 percent. The study also said that  in many colleges, student-athlete graduation rates are higher than those of the general student population.
“It’s a P.R. stunt,” Huma said. “The NCAA inflates graduation rates because it considers athletes who transfer to another school in good standing as college graduates, regardless of whether they actually receive a college degree.”
USC women’s volleyball coach Mick Haley said that in his 12 years of coaching at USC and 17 years coaching at the University of Texas, only one of his players did not graduate. He said his scholarship players took full advantage of their financial support.
“If you use up your athletic eligibility, the scholarship remains. If you get hurt, the scholarship remains,” Haley said. “The scholarship lasts until the student-athlete graduates.”
USC also continues providing for scholars if they suffer an injury, similar to what is proposed in Padilla’s bill.
“I know a couple of players who suffered career-ending injuries at USC but still got medical scholarships so they can get their degree,” Markowitz said.
Additional responsibilities during the athletic season can often impact athletes’ academics, Huma said.
“Lots of athletes come into college with relaxed academic standards, so they’re already behind, and then add in all the stress and time the season demands, plus mandatory training over the summer preventing athletes from getting jobs,” Huma said. “It’s pretty clear that academics are often sacrificed for sports.”
Haley said this is not the case at USC.
“Academic excellence is our top priority,” he said.
If Padilla’s bill passes, colleges will not be able to revoke scholarships because of sports-related injuries and will have to cover athletes’ entire medical expenses when insurance falls short.
“You can’t recruit world-class athletes without providing medical benefits,” Haley said. “Athletes are smart and they do their research so they know what benefits their university provides them.”
Haley also said USC athletic scholarships cannot be revoked.
Women’s volleyball is not the only program at USC with high graduation rates. The men’s basketball team graduated eight of nine seniors, O’Neill said.
According to a press release from the NCAA, numbers calculated by the federal government put the graduation rate of Division I athletes at 65 percent.
Sports analysts are speculative as to whether Padilla’s bill will make a significant impact on college sports because graduation rates are already rising. According to the NCAA, 95 percent of colleges already cover student-athletes’ medical expenses. Huma and the NCPA, however, believe the bill will encourage more reform, specifically by increasing athletes’ stipends.
“Some of these student-athletes generate millions of dollars for their athletic departments, yet do not receive enough support to consistently pay for food,” Huma said.
The NCAA approved a plan last December to increase the players’ monthly stipend to $2,000, but the plan was voted down by 125 schools because of its financial burden on colleges located in areas with low-living expenses.
“This bill is long overdue and needs to be passed to protect student-athletes,” Huma said. “All student-athletes should support this bill.”
