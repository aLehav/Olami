Gimel Keaton, better known by his stage name, Young Guru, will serve as an artist-in-residence at the Thornton School of Music for the 2013-14 academic year. The Grammy-nominated audio engineer and disc jockey is well known for his work with rapper Jay Z and his album mixing for artists Beyoncé, Eminem, Kanye West and Drake.
Guru will give lectures on electronic music, hip hop, songwriting and the music industry to students in the contemporary music division of Thornton, giving them the opportunity to hear from a professional with 12 years of experience in the music industry. Young Guru will also consult with Thornton faculty to develop a new degree program in music production.
Past musicians who have served as Thornton artists-in-residence include guitarist Steve Miller and R&B composer and songwriter Patrice Rushen.
Young Guru’s passion isn’t solely dedicated to music; the artist also has many philanthropic pursuits, working through The Young Guru Foundation and its partnership with SAE Institute Cape Town and Heal the Hood — organizations that provide scholarships for higher education and mentorship to help underserved young adults reach their career goals. The foundation works with students ranging in age from juniors in high school to graduate students.
“I would like our culture to understand its value and its reference point in history,” Young Guru said in a press release. “I want it to be fully understood by people, to be studied and revered the same way you would study jazz artists or opera at a class in a university.”
Young Guru has previously lectured at New York University’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, Emory University, Loyola University New Orleans, Middle Tennessee State University and Drexel University. He has also lectured at the headquarters of Pandora and Google.

A panel discussion on the media coverage of the June meeting between President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping of China took place Tuesday at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
Media Blitz · Director of the USC U.S.-China Institute Clayton Dube speaks in front of panelists about the media coverage of the widely publicized meeting between President Obama and President Xi of China. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
The event’s panel featured School of Journalism Director Michael Parks, Interim Director of Annenberg’s Center on Communication Leadership and Policy Geoffrey Cowan and Director of the USC U.S.–China Institute Clayton Dube.
The meeting between the American and Chinese presidents, which took place at Sunnylands, Walter H. Annenberg’s Rancho Mirage, Calif. estate, included issues ranging from cybersecurity to climate change, according to Forbes.
The meeting, however, also drew incongruent coverage from both the international and domestic press and became a widely discussed topic in popular culture in the two nations.
The journalism forum focused on the treatment of the event in the media, as well as some of  the behind-the-scenes details of the presidential summit.
To begin the discussion, Cowan brought up some of the failures of the American media in the coverage of the Sunnylands summit, including a New York Times article that said First Lady Michelle Obama was going to skip the event.
“Michelle Obama was never going to be there, but the fact that The New York Times wrote an article [about it] created a problem,” Cowan said.
Dube talked about why the summit was such an important meeting between two world leaders, as well as how the disparate media coverage is a concerning issue.
“In GDP, global trade, defense spending … what our two countries do matters, and this is why this meeting is important,” Dube said.
In explaining the American media’s presentation of the Sunnylands summit, Dube presented photos from various newspapers, ranging from the Los Angeles Times to the Chicago Tribune, as examples. Though several news sources paid attention to the political event, approximately half of the major newspapers Dube presented did not contain any stories about Obama’s meeting with Xi.
Dube also displayed the three largest Chinese newspapers, all of which featured the exact same stories and included the Sunnylands summit as a headline.
“The Chinese stay on message … because [they] have somebody dictating that message throughout,” Dube said.
According to Dube, a major issue with American news outlets is that they are commercialized and that the editorial process of the United States’ media focuses on maximizing the sale of news materials.
USC students had both comments and concerns on the media’s distribution of information to the American public.
“I think it’s interesting that there’s so much more media coverage of [the Sunnylands summit] in China, as if the Chinese citizens are so much more interested in the relationship between the two countries,” said Luke Phillips, a sophomore majoring in international relations and history. “In terms of having good foreign policy, the media has a large responsibility in keeping people informed as widely and as deeply as possible.”
Songyu Zhu, a junior from China majoring in history, attended the panel discussion because of her interest in social media.
“I think it’s important to also look at social media. Television and newspapers are visual images, not interactions between real people,” Zhu said. “Media can have a positive influence on people if they are offering a wide range of opportunities for people to access information. Through the media, people can learn about the two countries’ cultures and affairs.”
The discussion provided an opportunity for USC students to discuss issues of foreign policy and political affairs as well as journalism and the media in American society.
Cowan believes that all USC students should seize the opportunities that arise on campus to be a part of discussions about society and international relations.
“One of the most valuable experiences USC students have is to go to events that aren’t a part of their classroom experience,” Cowan said. “You’ll be exposed to ideas, controversies and opportunities, and those are among the most exciting things that happen on this university’s campus.”

Dr. Thomas McAfee, who was set to become CEO of the new Keck Medicine of USC Medical Foundation on Tuesday, passed away Friday while on vacation in Tanzania. His cause of death has not yet been released.
Remembrance · Thomas McAfee was poised to begin his new role as CEO of Keck Medicine of USC Medical Foundation on Sept. 3. – Photo courtesy of Nick Abadilla
McAfee was selected to become CEO after Keck Medicine conducted a nationwide search with a private firm to fill the position. He most recently served as dean of clinical affairs at the University of California, San Diego, and previously worked at University of California, San Francisco, Stanford University and in the private sector.
Since McAfee died only days before he was supposed to start working at Keck Medicine, current plans for the USC Medical Foundation were built around him filling the CEO position.
“We’ve been working on [the foundation] in our strategic plan that we finished about six months ago,” said Shawn Sheffield, chief strategy and business development officer at the Keck Medical Center. “Dr. McAfee was really going to be the physician lead on that … He was selected as the guy to be the face of it and really work with groups and get out there.”
The foundation will centralize all of Keck Medicine’s acquired physician practices by providing a broad range of health services across a wider geographic area. The foundation model will also allow Keck Medicine to expand its managed care practice and more efficiently provide health care to USC employees.
“The foundation is a structure where physicians in private practice who are now faculty can become part of the USC Network and use our medical records and marketing and really be part of it all, but still be in private practice,” said Thomas Jackiewicz, senior vice president and CEO of USC Health.
As CEO, McAfee would have been in charge of maintaining relationships across all of Keck Medicine’s entities, including with physician groups, clinical service providers and local hospitals to develop standards of care and improve clinical practices.
McAfee was planning on working closely with Keck Medicine leadership, department chairs, USC Verdugo Hills Hospital and USC Care Medical Group. He also would have served as chair of several physician committees to align clinical programs across Keck Medicine’s spectrum.
“We laid out the structure for the foundation before Tom got here,” Jackiewicz said. “He was an important part of our strategy, and we’re going to have to relaunch our recruiting efforts.”
Despite McAfee’s would-be central role in the foundation, Sheffield said Keck Medicine will move forward with the strategic plan they already have in place and recruit another candidate to fill the CEO position.
“We will continue to move forward with the plans,” Sheffield said. “It’s unfortunate. I think he would have been an outstanding person to bring order and really move this forward, but we’ll continue with that initiative and go out and look for another candidate to fill that role.”
Though the foundation will continue its  development as planned, colleagues, family and friends alike will still mourn McAfee.
“Tom was a very unique and talented physician. He was very personable, a great doctor and also understood health care economics as well as any physician I’ve ever worked with,” Jackiewicz said. “I think it’s a great loss for USC, but it’s also a great loss for health care in general because he was one of those very perceptive leaders whose pursuit of health care reform really made a difference.”

On Friday, USC’s Office of Sustainability hosted students interested in gardening for a fall seed-starting workshop at its urban garden on 3015 Shrine Place. During the event, attendees had the chance to learn about which seeds thrive in fall climates, and were even provided with seeds, pots and soil to plant some of these vegetables and bring them home.
The workshop was just one of many events the office has planned for the coming year. They are also planning on starting another garden on a new plot of land, supporting student programs, working with student groups to advertise at the farmers’ market and collaborating with groups on campus to form sustainability events.
The urban garden has been around since 2010 and Sustainability has continually used it as a resource. USC’s garden is not only a thriving patch of green in the middle of Los Angeles, but also the only garden at USC that grows food. Though student volunteers provide the labor that goes into maintaining the garden, local nonprofit Urban Farming supplies seeds, soil and tools.
According to Estefanee Villalba, the USC Office of Sustainability’s Urban Garden Coordinator, an urban garden is simply a “garden in the middle of an urban city,” but the concept of creating one has been important to USC.
“The urban garden shows the community that you can grow your own stuff in pots in your apartment,” Villalba said.
Besides having its own urban garden, the Office of Sustainability works to encourage others to start their own gardens.
“I want [elementary school students] to be aware that they can actually grow some of their own food,” Villalba said.
The Office of Sustainability, however, has faced many problems when it comes to starting a garden at nearby 32nd Street School, the most pressing of which has been getting funding. Even when sustainability workers are able to start gardens at elementary schools, the schools often cannot afford to water them every day. Because of these challenges, the group usually focuses on simply educating the kids about gardening.
Reaching out to grade schools isn’t all the Office of Sustainability does. Throughout the 2013-14 school year, Villalba will work with Jad Wenger from Heartbeet Gardening, a company that helps maintain the urban garden. Together, Villaba and Wenger hope to expand the garden and plant more in the land they have.
Starting this year, Sustainability also hopes to work with Starbucks to start a better compost pile, which will benefit the garden and the environment.
Justin Bogda, a senior at USC who is in charge of programming and student outreach for USC’s Office of Sustainability, is putting together a Green Student Assembly. The group will be part of a joint effort between the Office of Sustainability and the USG Program Board to oversee programs such as Earth Week and green organizations on campus.
Because there is no sustainability club on campus, the Green Student Assembly will be a way for students to get more involved with the Office of Sustainability. Currently, the office is small and off-campus, and many students are unaware of the opportunities available.
The Green Student Assembly will be able to assist student organizations using funding from USG.
“As most assemblies do, we can recognize any student organization to help provide them with funding for their events,” Bogda said.
The Office of Sustainability welcomes volunteers to help with USC’s urban garden, but has been having trouble finding people willing to help with the dirty work.
“I find that a lot of volunteers that come to the garden want to volunteer but don’t want to get their hands dirty,” Villalba said.  Most of her volunteers are the same people who go to the workshops, the people who are aware of what gardening entails and are willing to help out.
Applications to join the Green Student Assembly are available online and will be considered until this Friday. Bogda said that he hopes to “create a presence on campus for years to come” and “start a culture this semester and get people who are very dedicated.”

For a program still in its infant stage, the USC women’s sand volleyball program has made a significant impact in its brief two-year history. Though on-field results have been positive, they pale in comparison to Tuesday’s announcement that three-time Olympic gold medalist and beach volleyball legend Misty May-Treanor will be joining the program as a volunteer assistant coach.
As May-Treanor is one of the most decorated beach volleyball players of all time, USC head coach Anna Collier and the rest of the team are ecstatic to have her as part of their on-the-rise program, which will be entering its third season of competitive play this spring.
“Misty has a great work ethic both on and off the court,” Collier said in a statement. “She will bring that same ethic to the team, which will enable our student athletes to see the kind of hard work it takes to become a top sand volleyball player. USC and the sand volleyball team are extremely privileged to add such a valuable asset to our coaching staff. I believe it’s just going to elevate our team to another level and make us a national contender.”
May-Treanor comes to USC after winning three gold medals in beach volleyball with her long-time partner Kerri Walsh-Jennings. The duo became the first-ever to three-peat in the sport. She also holds several other records, including the most women’s tournament victories, most women’s career earnings and most women’s international wins.
Perhaps her most outstanding accomplishment is the 90-match winning streak she held with Walsh-Jennings in 2004 en route to winning gold at the 2004 Athens Olympics without losing a single set.
“I am really excited to be joining the USC sand volleyball program and its tremendous coaching staff this year,” May-Treanor said. “I can’t wait to learn from coach Anna Collier and to help bring a championship to the university. I am truly looking forward to working with these great student athletes and hope to aid in pushing them to that next level.”
This is also a homecoming of sorts for the four-time AVP Most Valuable Player Award winner, who attended Long Beach State and Newport Harbor High School, where she led her teams to national and state titles, respectively.
May-Treanor will look to help take the team beyond their No. 4 final ranking and AVCA semifinal exit from last season.

“Putting your best foot forward” is about as cliche as it gets when discussing a soccer team, but that is exactly what the No. 22 USC women’s soccer team did over the weekend as it continued its hot start to begin the season. The Women of Troy used a potent attack to knock off Cal State Northridge 4-1 in their home opener Friday at McAlister Field.
Unstoppable · Senior forward Elizabeth Eddy started the season on a tear, scoring four goals in three games for the unbeaten Women of Troy. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
USC (3-0) is off to its best start since 2007 with its third straight four-goal performance of the season. Senior forward Elizabeth Eddy, freshman forward Kayla Mills, sophomore forward Katie Johnson and freshman forward Tanya Samarzich each scored a goal for USC, and junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley picked up four saves.
Northridge (0-4) dropped its third straight game of the season after making the first round of the NCAA tournament last season. The Matadors’ only goal came off of a penalty kick from Chloe McDaniel in the 66th minute.
USC came out of the gate aggressively, hoping to match its first-half production from the previous two matches. The team was held in check for most of the half by Northridge goalie Jovani McCaskill until Johnson sent a pass from Mills into the back of the net for USC’s first goal in the 26th minute. They struck again quickly, with Samarzich deflecting a cross from sophomore defender Marlee Carrillo into the net in the 30th minute.
A tense moment came later in the game, when Northridge’s Natalie Rivas and USC sophomore forward Whitney Pitalo collided around midfield going for the ball. Pitalo appeared fine after the collision, but Rivas remained on the ground for several minutes. She got up shortly after and returned to the bench, only to come back out on the field completely unscathed.
The Women of Troy continued their onslaught on the Matadors in the second half. Eddy scored her fourth goal of the season less than four minutes into the half, off of a pass to the box from senior midfielder Jordan Marada.
“A lot of it has to do with persistence and never giving up, and that’s a strong attribute of our team this year, to keep going,” Eddy said about her goal-scoring outburst. “Even if it’s not successful yet, just keep doing the game plan.”
As USC kept adding to their lead, Northridge started to match the Women of Troy’s aggression, putting shot after shot on goal in order to generate some offense. Despite some forced shots and offsides penalties, the strategy paid off when Lyndsey Preston was tackled by Carillo in the USC area, awarding a penalty kick to the Matadors, which McDaniel put in the back of the net in the 66th minute to cut the USC lead to 3-1. It was the first goal of the year for Northridge, which had been shut out in previous losses to UCLA and Arizona State.
“I think we just worked for each other,” Mills said. “We worked for each other, and we remembered everything we did in practice. We try to work really hard on and off the ball.”
Mills helped put an exclamation point on USC’s performance, speeding down the field in the 75th minute and putting it just past McCaskill to extend the USC lead to 4-1, giving the Women of Troy three consecutive games with four goals scored. McGaskill, who had previously made a nice diving save to block a shot from USC junior midfielder Alex Quincey, finished with four saves on USC’s eight shots on goal.
USC outshot the Matadors 15-11 and had five corner kicks to Northridge’s zero, but committed 13 fouls to Northridge’s nine.
“Twelve goals in three games tells you everything you need to know,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “I think scoring goals is always a challenge, and when you’re able to score four off of 15 shots, that’s pretty significant.”
The Women of Troy will travel to Minneapolis, Minn. for the Minnesota Gold Classic next weekend, taking on Ole Miss (3-0) on Friday at 2:30 p.m. and LSU (2-1-1) on Sunday at 9 p.m.

June 10, 2010 is when it all started. That was the day the NCAA handed down some of the stiffest and most stringent penalties of all time in its sanctions against the USC football program. That was when I became skeptical about the integrity and questionable motives of the NCAA as an institution.
Looking back, if this extreme punishment had signaled a new direction for the enforcement arm of the NCAA, or if they had made a conscious decision to use USC’s case as a springboard for a new era of zero tolerance, it might have been different.
If that were the case, I could chalk up my resentment towards the NCAA as a manifestation of the dejection and disappointment felt by a die-hard fan as the Trojans struggled under the enormous burden of such harsh sanctions. Even though it would be like pulling teeth, I could rationalize and understand that sanctions were imposed for the greater good of amateur athletics. If that were the case, it would be easy to scoff at former Athletic Director Mike Garrett’s suggestion that the NCAA’s actions were based in jealousy and envy.
The bitter pill would be much easier to swallow if only the NCAA had begun to display even a semblance of consistency or reliability in their actions following June 10. Instead, we have watched as NCAA President Mark Emmert and his band of cronies continue to run one of the most hypocritical organizations in America.
When it comes to the NCAA’s many head-scratching decisions, where should I begin? The lack of investigative prowess has been well on display, glaringly apparent in the incompetent inquiry into whether or not former Auburn quarterback Cam Newton had any knowledge his dad, Cecil Newton, was auctioning off his son’s services to the highest bidder.
The double standard is downright offensive to anyone with a moral or ethical inclination. The most glaring example of hypocrisy, though, would have to be the late Paul Dee serving as chairman of the committee in charge of levying sanctions towards USC. Yes, the same Paul Dee who, as athletic director of the University of Miami, failed to notice booster Nevin Shapiro and Miami athletes running wild with drugs and strippers. Talk about a lack of institutional control.
The vitriol against the NCAA has come from a variety of different media. Whether it be a lawsuit headed by Ed O’Bannon or a column from ESPN‘s Jay Bilas, the NCAA is certainly being taken to task for its woefully reprehensible actions. Even with all the outrage surrounding the NCAA, my outright animosity hadn’t been cemented until the past two weeks.
The complete indignation stems from two issues that have revealed themselves recently. Though it has always seemed ridiculous to me that athletes are forbidden from benefiting from their refined skill set, the true inanity did not dawn on me until this week. If I weren’t allowed to capitalize on my own abilities while in college, I would question the legality of the situation in a free market society.
The fact that athletes’ talents put them in a position to prosper on an extremely elevated level exacerbates the issue even further. As a new college student, I cannot even begin to comprehend the feelings of exploitation and irritation student athletes must feel as they bring in millions in revenue to athletic departments without even getting a slice of the proverbial pie.
Now, if one wants to make the antiquated argument that players should maintain their amateur status, as the NCAA does, it would seem to me that they would want to crack down on illicit benefits to players, say in the form of cash for autographs.
Yet, it is abundantly evident in the case of Johnny Manziel that the NCAA either doesn’t have the resources or — more likely — shirks the responsibility of truly investigating such matters.
I am not condemning or criticizing Manziel for capitalizing on his unique talents — more power to him. Under the current rules set forth by the NCAA, however, his alleged wrongdoings seem to warrant more than a university-imposed half-game suspension against a less than stellar opponent. It seems ridiculous for the NCAA to preach from their moral high ground about the need for amateur athletics and the purity it brings, while completely ignoring the illicit deals taking place right under their noses.
The NCAA’s blatant hypocrisy and complete lack of a moral backbone have crystallized before my eyes as both a college student and major college sports fan. Even so, I am certainly not the first enthusiast to notice this disturbing trend and that’s where the true problem lies.
Maybe O’Bannon’s lawsuit will change the dynamic, or Todd McNair’s crusade to restore his unfairly besmirched name will expose the NCAA. But the truth is that we can cry out until kingdom come about the NCAA, and yet most of us will still be planted in our seats gleefully anticipating kickoff on Saturday.
As fans, our lack of meaningful protest ultimately hurts the players and, to a lesser extent, puts out a diminished product. Yet that diminished product draws us in week after week, year after year, and, when the sanctions end, it will all go back to normal for the outraged fan base.
So really, when will we hold the sham of an institution the NCAA marauds itself to be accountable for its actions? And who will be the catalyst for that charge? Maybe the fact that the question has no answer is the actual problem with college athletics.

I’d like to know where the latest fiasco concerning the SEC factors in. Its as though the NCAA will only punish certain schools. What was done to USC was absolutely despicable.
No offense Jake, but I love and respect the NCAA. Everyone needs to tone down their disrespect for an organization which has to control 1000s upon 1000s of student athletes. It is the athletes who mess up in collegiate sports, NOT the people who deliver the punishments (the NCAA). In addition, the NCAA does NOT make the rules. They simply enforce them.
This support for the NCAA is mindboggling and poorly thought.  To begin with, suggesting that the sheer volume of student athletes under the NCAA’s ‘watchful’ eye is some sort of excuse is like defending the LAPD over a “use of excessive force” incident simply because there are roughy 10,000 officers in the Department.  Likewise, hospitals see thousands of patients, hundreds simultaneously, and must still answer for their response and care of each one.
Second, I think it’s disingenuous to suggest that the NCAA merely enforces the rules.  They are very much involved in crafting the rules that govern collegiate athletics.  Moreover, the NCAA weilds enormous power in that it is all but impossible to compete on any sort of recognized level unless an institution signs on with the NCAA.  It’s very much like anyone in the film and television industry attempting to work outside the realm of the major guilds and unions.
Finally, simply “enforcing” rules and laws doesn’t excuse anything.  As anyone with even a remote understanding of the law understands, enforcement was me just and equitable.  Jake’s argument against the NCAA clearly underscores the ambiguity and hypocrisy in the NCAA’s enforcement of the policies.

Someone should be taken to task for hiring  and  overseeing the NCAA brass.
The entire NCAA organization and  its rules are a joke

As USC prepares for its Pac-12 season opener against Washington State, the storyline continues to center on who will start at quarterback for the team’s second game of the season. With the entire program seemingly sworn to secrecy, mum was the word after Tuesday’s practice.
Questionable · After an uneven performance at Hawi’i, it is unclear whether redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler start on Saturday. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“[If a starter was made public], the starter would have been scrutinized a lot,” USC head coach Lane Kiffin said. “It’s then natural for everybody to be telling the backup how he got a bad deal.”
Though he didn’t explicitly say so, Kiffin indicated that playing time might not be split so evenly on Saturday as it was against Hawai’i.
“The starting quarterback got the majority of the reps [on Tuesday],” Kiffin said.
Throughout fall camp, Kessler and Wittek more or less split time evenly with the first team offense, so whichever ends up starting against Washington State might get most or all of the playing time.
The quarterbacks themselves have followed Kiffin’s lead of keeping the decision a secret.
“My phone has been blowing up [about who will start],” Kessler said. “But that’s Coach Kiffin’s decision, and we’re gonna keep working no matter what. I’m just getting ready to play on Saturday.”
DAZZLING DEBUTS
With USC’s depth at running back, carries can be tough to come by in practice, let alone in games. But don’t tell that to freshman tailback Justin Davis, who amassed 74 yards on 14 carries and scored the team’s only rushing touchdown in the win over Hawai’i.
“That was one of the really positive stories out of that game,” Kiffin said. “Obviously you want to focus on the quarterbacks, but there were a lot of really good things, led by Justin Davis. If he doesn’t fumble that ball, he’s gonna have 100 yards rushing in his first game. That’s not an easy thing to do.”
As for Thursday’s starting running back, redshirt sophomore Tre Madden, the reviews were just as glowing. Madden, who missed all of last season because of a torn ACL, spent his true freshman season at linebacker before moving to tailback last year.
A quarterback and linebacker in high school, Madden has displayed his versatility since returning to full strength.
“He really can do anything,” Kiffin said. “You saw him start as a true freshman at linebacker. He’s a unique athlete. He throws the ball well, he runs well, has great ball skills and field awareness.”
Madden’s experience at quarterback could make him an intriguing option as a quarterback in the Wildcat formation. In his collegiate debut as a running back, Madden had 109 yards on 18 carries.
On the other side of the ball, freshman safety Su’a Cravens was the one turning heads. In just the fourth play of his career, he dove in front of a Hawai’i receiver to make an outstanding interception along the sideline, flashing his immense talent and lightning-quick instincts.
Both Cravens and Davis graduated high school a semester early in order to participate in spring practice, and their preparation appears to have paid its dividends.
GROWING PAINS
Though he earned the nod as starter, Kessler’s performance against Hawai’i left room for improvement. He showed flashes of excellence, but made some rookie mistakes, such as taking a sack for a safety and throwing an interception in the opponent’s territory.
“I learned that there’s going to be ups and downs,” Kessler said. “Those first two drives, we went right down the field. Then in those middle three drives, I made some mental mistakes that I shouldn’t have.”
Given that he was in the midst of his first collegiate start, it would be understandable for Kessler to lose confidence. But a 19-yard touchdown strike to sophomore receiver Nelson Agholor seemed to give him the boost that he needed to move past his mistakes.
“Finishing off that drive in the second quarter was great,” Kessler said. “I thought we did really well. I learned not to let your emotions get too high or too low, and just stay level-headed.”
HOMECOMING
After beginning the year in front of an opposing crowd, the Trojans return to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for the first time this year, giving the players an extra bounce in their step during practice.
“Any time you come home to a great place like the Coliseum, guys are going to be excited to get back in there,” Kiffin said. “A lot of new guys will be playing their first game in there, so we’ll continue to manage their emotions to make sure we’re playing really effective and not get out of whack just because we’re playing at home.”

In typical USC fashion, the women’s volleyball team steamrolled the competition in the season-opening Mortar Board Premier Tournament last weekend. After facing stiff competition in the opening match against No. 16 Purdue, the Women of Troy went on to dominate the following three matches, taking all nine sets they played en route to claiming the tournament crown.
Airborne · Senior outside hitter Sara Shaw played in every set of USC’s tournament victory in the Mortar Board Premier. Shaw walked away with 21 kills and 17 digs in wins over Purdue, Western Kentucky and Alabama A&M. – Daily Trojan file photo
USC came into the tournament with lofty expectations, featuring a returning All-American in senior libero Natalie Hagglund and a top-five national preseason ranking, but the team’s true talent level came through on the court against the Purdue Boilermakers.
After hitting a dismal .121 in a first-set loss to Purdue, who hosted the tournament, the Women of Troy turned things around in the second set. Sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio led the charge with stellar offensive play, posting 12 kills on the match. USC led by as many as seven points in the set, and despite a last-minute run by the Boilermakers, USC shut the door with a kill by senior outside hitter Sara Shaw.
The third set of the match was highly contested, seeing ten tied scores and five lead changes, but with the score tied at 20, the Women of Troy pulled ahead, as standout freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu earned a kill to reach a 22-20 lead and assisted on a block to pull away in the set. Bricio ensured the victory with a kill on the 25th point and the stage was set for USC to win their first match of the year in the next set.
In the fourth set, the Trojans were able to capitalize on Purdue errors in the passing game, pulling ahead to an early 15-8 lead. Offensively, the trio of Bricio, Nwanebu and Shaw was enough to make quick work of the Boilermakers, as Hagglund and junior middle blocker Hannah Schraer were integral in setting up kills. With the offensive explosion setting the pace, USC held on to win by a final score of 25-16.
The hard work wasn’t over for the Women of Troy, however, as they had to face another top-25 team in Western Kentucky the next day. The Hilltoppers were no match for USC, but gave the Women of Troy all they could handle in the early goings. WKU was feisty in the first set, making the opposition earn every point as USC grinded out a 25-23 victory. USC trailed by five at two separate times in the set, but fought its way back to the eventual                                        two-point win with gritty blocking and opportune kills.
Though the first set was a nail-biter, the second two sets of the match proved to be more lopsided, as the USC defense clamped down and never let up. In the second set, USC allowed only nine kills en route to a 25-18 victory. The team won the third and decisive set by the same score, cruising to victory after sophomore middle blocker Alicia Ogoms tied the score at eight apiece early in the set. Bricio led the team with 15 points (good for a .444 hitting percentage) in the match, and Nwanebu led all players with 13 kills.
With the first two matches wrapped up, all the Women of Troy needed to do to clinch the tournament championship was defeat unranked Alabama A&M. USC lived up to the challenge, as the team blasted its way to an impressive .435 hitting percentage and racked up 15 service aces. Defensively, the team held the Lady Bulldogs to an .043 hitting percentage en route to a three-set sweep, winning the sets by finals of 25-13, 25-14 and 25-9.
Bricio, Hagglund and Nwanebu were named to the all-tournament team for their outstanding play during the weekend, and Bricio took home the title of tournament MVP.
USC’s next challenge will come in the form of the Marquette Challenge, where it will face Texas Christian University and Marquette in Milwaukee, Wisc. on Friday. From there the team will travel south to face the Huskies of Northern Illinois Univeristy in DeKalb, Ill. on Saturday.

Straight from the shores of Hawaii, stand up paddle boarding has surged in popularity. In fact, it is one of the world’s fastest growing sports. It’s not an exclusively West Coast phenomenon, either — it can also be found on the lakes and rivers of the eastern reaches of the country.
Stand up paddling, also known as SUP, seems on the surface to be an easygoing water activity. My abs and arms, however, will tell you a different story. Even just an hour of paddling proves to be a nice workout that doesn’t feel strenuous at the time but reminds you later just how hard your muscles actually worked.
Since I grew up in a Southern California beach city, some might assume that I also grew up with a surfboard permanently at my side. Though my house was about 10 minutes from the beach, my life, and those of most of my friends, was not like an episode of Laguna Beach. If anything, I’m more of a Seth Cohen from The O.C.—and I think we can all agree that Seth and surfing would be an odd mix.
During the summers of my elementary school days, however, I participated in the California Junior Lifeguard Program. We learned the basics of CPR, how to escape riptides and most importantly, how to eat a sandwich on the beach without getting sand in it. One day the instructors even offered us surf lessons. Finally, a chance to realize my locally grown, hidden talent of surfing!
Unfortunately, being the athletic champ that I am, I was last in line and thus got stuck with a board way too big for me. That was the first and last day of my surfing career.
So, naturally, I didn’t expect a lot of success to come from stand up paddling. In simple terms, it is standing on a slightly wider surfboard while driving through waves with a stickshift. As is the case with so many other exercises, there are aspects of stand up paddling that are easy to grasp and others that require more skill, whether natural or acquired.
The L.A. coastal area is filled with many options for places from which to rent, buy and receive paddleboarding lessons. Poseidon Paddle Boards, a company offering all three, can be found in multiple locations, including Malibu, Santa Monica and Marina Del Rey.
Though my paddleboarding fantasy involved me “shredding gnar waves” in the ‘Bu, as a beginner it’s recommended to start in the calmer waters of Marina Del Rey, a harbor located next to Venice Beach. Considering the sometimes vicious reputation of Malibu surfers toward overly eager novices such as myself, this change of location was probably for the best.
Chris, our instructor, was an excellent tour guide into the watery world of SUP. Our instruction began on the sand, where we learned a paddleboarder should stand in the middle of the board with feet approximately shoulder-length apart for optimal balance. The paddle used for paddleboarding is adjustable in length, calculated using your wingspan and height, and must be switched from hand to hand, side-to-side when atop the water.
This paddle handoff proved to be slightly tricky, but Chris assured me it’s perfectly normal to constantly batter your own board with a wayward paddle. After a few practice strokes, we were ready to hit the water.
For me, balancing on the board was initially — please note I say “initially” — not an issue at all. The waters of the Marina Del Rey harbor were calm, enabling me to perfect my paddling technique. Chris advised that it helps to remember that your paddle is meant to pull your board through the water, not to move the water around your board.
In other words, you can’t expect to control the water using a paddle, so instead, you have to focus on using the board’s momentum to glide through a path created by your own strokes. It’s also necessary to push in with your paddle so that you get some leverage; just slapping the water with the broad side of the paddle will get you nowhere fast.
Speaking of speed, the above sections might make it sound like I’m now a semi-expert at paddleboarding, but do not be mistaken. Though I can operate a paddleboard with minimal success, I definitely won’t be winning any SUP races in the near future. You know you’re lacking in speed when an elderly couple passes you on foot.
Probably because of my desperate need for speed, paddleboarding, though enjoyable, started to feel monotonous as we glided through the main channel of Marina Del Rey. Just when I thought I couldn’t tolerate the same view any longer, the jetty opened up to reveal the open ocean. This change of scenery was at once exciting and anxiety-inducing.
Up until this point, I hadn’t fallen off the board. Once we reached the real Pacific, where waves are bigger than the wake produced by a boat traveling a measly five knots per hour, stable footing was harder to maintain. I won’t say that I fell overboard a lot, but I also won’t say I didn’t.
Out there on the actual ocean, though, is where I found my Zen moment, a concept that is actually relevant to paddleboarding since many boarders also practice yoga while paddling. And while my downward dog remained on land, I did discover a peace inspired by the gentle roll of the waves that could never be achieved anywhere but on a paddleboard in the middle of the ocean.
This, I realized, must be the reason surfers and other ocean sport enthusiasts covet their domains so vigorously. Looking out on the Southern California coastline, straddling a paddleboard, I could let my mind wander, enveloped and cleansed by the salty Pacific waves.

Tired of the September heat? Nestled in a corner of the bustling Grand Central Market is newly opened Sweet Clementine’s Pops, a cart selling fresh popsicles with innovative new flavors on a daily basis. The cart is small — almost easy to miss — but it is well worth finding.
Owner Layne Eiler started the project in 2012, transporting her own fresh fruit popsicles in a cooler to various special events around the Los Angeles area.
After decorating her cart with colorful stripes and floral prints, the next step for Sweet Clementine’s Pops was to have a tasting, and after conducting one in April, the company officially launched on April 17, beginning with pop-ups at Handsome Coffee in the Arts District. After these pop-ups became successful, Grand Central Market approached Eiler about bringing her popsicles to the facility, and she’s been there ever since, six days a week, with pop-ups at Handsome Coffee every Wednesday evening.
The move-in of Sweet Clementine’s also marks another step in Grand Central Market’s ongoing revamp headed by consultant Joseph Shuldiner and the management team to bring more foodie-friendly venues to the market. The Grand Central Market is an incredibly busy venue on Broadway Street in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles — about a 10-minute drive from the USC campus. There are many different permanent food venues ranging from fruits, vegetables and different cuts of meat to authentic Mexican or Thai food. Nonetheless, Sweet Clementine’s proves that it is able to keep up with the pace of larger stations by successfully crafting refreshing popsicles with a wide appeal.
Eiler acknowledged that there is  high demand in the frozen yogurt world, but it seemed to her that all the dairy used in frozen yogurt can feel heavy and dense, and she wanted a lighter alternative. She makes the creatively flavored popsicles every evening in her kitchen, but said that she is in the process of moving into a commercial kitchen. Eiler summed up the need for refreshment in the sweltering California summers with a simple “we should have popsicles.”
The popsicle flavors vary from day to day, since they are all made the previous night. They are made without preservatives or artificial anything — simple and pure with real fruit and raw ingredients — and sold for $2.50 each. They come wrapped in a small sheet of wax paper atop a thick wooden toothpick and are just the right size for an indulgent snack.
The strawberry basil popsicle is a popular flavor, and the combination struck a delicious contrast between the succulent strawberries and the subtle pepperiness of the basil. The texture of the popsicles was also somewhat grainy, but that only went to show how organic the product really was. The popsicles tasted homemade in the best sense of the word, and there were no secrets as to what ingredients were put into the product. They were truly natural and delectable fruity treats.
Other flavors of the day included honeydew ginger, watermelon lime cayenne, and a pluot medley. The pluot popsicle was a flavorful combination of flavors, bringing the sweetness of a plum together with the tanginess of an apricot. Other flavors range from lemon buttermilk to blackberry, yogurt, and honey. At the end of the day, Eiler said she  hopes to “bring something that’s a healthy, quality product with that nostalgic feel.”
Sweet Clementine’s Pops has only been up and running for about four and a half months, and the contract with Grand Central Market is temporary. When asked about the possibility of a storefront in the future, Eiler said she is thinking of expanding, with some exciting new plans starting in the fall — not a storefront per se, but other upcoming projects.
Eiler says she considers the cart to only be a seasonal business, but there’s sure to be more to come from this California native with a love for satisfying food.

Dean Slater: Resident Advisor, directed by Colin Sander, sets out to redeem the genre of college flicks by pushing a message to unplug and enjoy the world around you.  Though often crude and sappy, the movie makes up for its missteps with a topical message and entertaining plot.

The film follows freshman Tyler Harris (Nick Renaud) and his two new college roommates, Cory Burton (Glenn McCuen) and Yuji Sokora (Jimmy Wong), during their first weeks of college with infamous resident advisor, Dean Slater (Mitchell Jarvis). The main character Tyler finds himself at fictional Southern California State University after being denied by his dream school, CalTech.  Touted as “one of the top 10 party schools in America,” SCSU seems like a death sentence for Tyler. This all changes, however, when the new RA arrives.
RA Dean Slater serves as a living legend at this university, and strives to transform Tyler and the rest of the boys’ college experience. He steps in to put the three guys under his wing and teach them a thing or two about college life. Lessons range from mastering the art of Japanese kendama to hiding your phone battery during a night out of drinking. Among the escapades, Slater mixes in his own philosophical maxims, hoping for the boys to live life in the now and make the most out of college. The boys quickly find themselves inspired by Slater’s Confucius-style wisdom, who encourages them to “drink the party cup of life” and turn their back on phones and Internet.
With a budget of only $1.2 million, the movie’s cinematography is surprisingly well done, with a stellar picture and crisp visuals. Since it was filmed in sunny Southern California at local universities Chapman and Loyola Marymount University, the film can’t help but inspire comparisons to USC college life. The realism is extended by forgoing fake sets, filming instead in genuine college dorm rooms. Additionally, with a cast of mostly unknowns, the film acting is as good any you’d see in Hollywood today. One of USC’s very own, Nathalia Ramos, has a leading role.
Though there is an abundance of potty humor and crude jokes, it’s nothing you wouldn’t expect from a film depicting college life.Dean Slater serves as a defining comedic factor—the character’s advice is timely and hilarious. One of his maxims has to do with doing a “buzz check,” a way of taming yourself before participating in a drunken escapade — something all college students could benefit from.
The film, however, has its flaws. In seeking to revolutionize college comedy, it often finds itself in an identity crisis. The beginning of the movie holds as a stereotypical college film, with scenes depicting games of beer pong and freshman guys out to get lucky. But eventually it digresses to an almost PSA-style attack against modern technology, with the boys suddenly deciding to forgo their smartphones and Internet on Slate’s advice.
As forced as it might be, the film’s message does have some truth. Though it’s depicted in a dramatic manner (at one point the boys flail their smartphones into the Pacific Ocean), one can’t help but notice the unsettling dependence we as college students have on our phones and social media.  The movie depicts the boys lost without them, questioning how their lives can move forward without texts of the latest parties and hangouts. They find themselves forced to interact with their classmates on a more intimate level, a phenomenon referred to in the movie as “face looking,” and by the end of the film they’re greater people for it.
On paper, Dean Slater: Resident Advisor has all the signs of a straight-to-DVD B film, but perhaps that’s what makes the film easier to like. Does it have its flaws? Yes. One can’t help but connect with the film and the movie’s central message. Though the film’s themes might be heavy-handed, its timeliness makes it worth a look.

This past summer, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority began to crack down on freeloaders of the Metro system by locking turnstile gates and placing Metro employees throughout the subway stations for random fare checks.
Though the Metro is not wrong to want people to pay for their transportation, the system itself is pricey for riders and is not friendly to the everyday working- class citizen who uses the Metro. Moreover, Los Angeles’ subway and bus systems are infamous for being dangerous. On Aug. 6, a 35-year-old man was killed by a Metro train at the Pershing Square stop in downtown Los Angeles. Accidents like this one cause commuters to lose faith in public transportation.
Beyond safety concerns, the Metro is also agonizingly slow; the trains have to stop at traffic lights just like cars and buses, causing delays and long travel time for riders. While the L.A. Metro worked with the City of Los Angeles Department of Transportation and successfully synchronized traffic lights in Los Angeles, little improvement in commute times have been seen thus far.
When the syncing of every traffic signal in L.A. was first announced, Councilmember Bill Rosendahl said, “I’m excited for all Angelenos to experience the benefits of this project, whether they’re traveling by car, bike or on foot.”
Rosendahl did not even note the effect the sync would have on public transit in his approval of the newest addition to Los Angeles.
When the Expo line opened its light rail in May of last year, Neal Broverman of Curbed Los Angeles wrote, “With all the line’s delays, it can be safely assumed that many don’t even know it’s operating yet.”
The newest problem with the Metro system, although not necessarily new at all, is its price.
Unlike in New York, where one swipe of $2.50 gets you into the subway and onto all lines, the Los Angeles Metro requires a fee of $1.50 every time you transfer stations. To put this into perspective, to get from USC to Koreatown requires two line transfers, and would therefore cost you $3.00 each way. Though the Metro does offer daily passes for only $5, as well as monthly passes for commuters and discounts for students, many people unfamiliar with Los Angeles are unaware of these options and also don’t know how much more they will be spending if they opt out of a day pass.
Ever since the crackdown on freeloaders of the Metro, the number of riders has significantly decreased. Paul Gonzales, who works with the Metro, told Southern California Public Radio, “We found in most cases that we’re seeing fewer riders during the testing period but more revenue.” While this may be a victory for Metro, there are now people who cannot afford to commute by Metro, which is the cheapest available method of getting around the city.
Without a sufficient public transportation system, people make the decision instead to drive their cars everywhere they go, further polluting the environment and perpetuating the monstrosity that is L.A. traffic. With a faster, cheaper and safer system, fewer people would have to drive their cars to work.
If Los Angeles ever wants to see its public transportation systems compare to those of other major cities, there are many things that need to change. The unfriendly pricing of the TAP card makes public transportation seem like an elitist system, and it only encourages people to drive their cars to work and create even more smog in the Los Angeles air.
If Los Angeles were to eliminate the charges that arise from switching Metro lines, commuting would cost less in the long run and enable those with lower incomes to use public transportation. If the city also made it a bigger priority to get the Metro and buses running more efficiently, Los Angeles would be more accessible without a car.

Metro is dangerous because on Aug. 6, a 35-year-old man was killed by a Metro train.  
OK, but do you have any idea how many HUNDREDS of people are killed on the freeways every year?
This is USC journalism? Really? I would ask for an immediate refund if I paid for USC tuition and still wrote this poorly researched, clearly biased article. Hope you kept your receipts!
Sounds like this article was written by a privileged USC student who has never visited other Metros around the world much less the country.  Buy a friggin pass!  Metro constructed the pricing strategy the way they did to encourage pass on TAP purchasing.  Sheesh!  And yes, Expo is a pain by not having signal priority but Expo is only one line of 6!  Red, Purple, and Green never stop at lights why not bring those lines into the conversation?  Gold stops so minimally at lights that it is almost not be mentioned and Blue after hitting speeds of up to 55mph to Long Beach loses signal priority only when it hits that city.  This is such a poorly written article that the editor should be fired.  And we won’t even get into the “how dangerous Metro is” argument.  Please just ask mommy and daddy to buy you a car, better yet go back to the burbs.  A shameful and lazy piece of work.
The author of this article is clearly not a Metro rider. As someone who has lived in this city without a car for over 2 years I can tell you that Metro works. It’s not perfect, as no system is, but it’s hardly “dangerous” nor is it inefficient. I live in Hollywood and work in Westchester and work in Culver City. It’s not that hard; you just have to plan ahead. Sometimes my commute home is actually faster using metro opposed to driving.
The author obviously IS a Metro rider.
Just not a submissive apologist like far too many of you.
I have been a Metro rider, along with regional systems, for a very long time.
The only positive changes I’ve seen in the system over the last … well … its been a while … are the occasional realization that local service should not be sacrificed for the myth of “Rapid” operation.
Beyond that, the system still fails to meet the most minimal standards that would entice an ordinary driver to use it.   The massive investment in rail could have been engineered to do as the BRU conspiracy theory suggests, attract the middle-class “white suburban” crowd, and thus, engender super-majority support for transit, but it too, fails, every step of the way.
And that is why the transit lobby, instead of apologizing and making amends for the error of their ways, continues to rally for punitive measures for anyone who chooses to drive.
Dave,
Commuting in LA sucks – but then so does driving – traffic all around sucks in LA. But that is not why this article is so bad. The points the author raises, reeks of immature thinking and a bunch of thoughts cobbled together in a last minute ditch effort to get an article in time for the deadline for publishing. One of the main points the author seems to be stuck on is that MTA has the audacity to enforcement payment for riders. I have been riding metro for over 10 years and it pisses me off seeing freeloaders take advantage of the “honor system”. Given the fact the honor system now has a few more procedures in place to encourage payment is not unreasonable nor should expecting proper payment be seen as some Gestapo tactic. one of the things that pisses me most about living in LA are all the self important D-bags that think they are the answer to what poor people need. Believe me – I had been a poor person for many years and it would be highly offensive to think the only way I can commute around LA is if i was able to jump turnstiles. 
I am sure Morgan meant well but perhaps less procrastination and more thought in writing the articles would yield something other then what a 6th grader from liberal Santa Monica parents would produce
The author should visit London where a single ride on the underground is $6
For those living outside London and commuting, the cost of annual rail passes can exceed $6,000.
I have visited LA over 50 times since 1982 and seen a vast improvement in the public transport network. It’s not perfect, but its not that bad, especially when you live between downtown, wilshire and the west side.
It’s amongst the cheapest systems worldwide and is easy to use
Getting to Koreatown from USC does not require a transfer. You take…the bus. Up Vermont.
You seem to be unclear on the relationship between Metro and the City of Los Angeles. Metro is a regional agency that spans many cities, including Pasadena, Santa Monica, Culver City, and Lakewood. Metro is controlled by a 13-member Board. The City of Los Angeles controls only 4 seats on the Board, and cannot simply revamp Metro as the headline bids.
Likewise, Metro did not partner with LADOT to synchronize LA’s signal system. Metro is a regional agency and has nothing to do with LADOT’s signal control.
Do your research, Morgan.
As usual, one can expect the transit advocates to come out of the woodwork and denounce any perspective that contradicts their unified front, as they chant their mantra, “Steel wheels good, Four tires bad.”
The fact is that LA’s MetroRail system is in its TWENTY-FOURTH year of operation, not 15th, as ChrisJ cites in his attempt to wring our collective hands of responsibility for a failed system.
.
By now, citizens should expect that the system produces results and hold a generation of politicians accountable, but instead, the same culprits that made the system so crummy, remain in office.
The reason trains stop at red lights is because they run at-grade.
The conflict was known long before the first ground-breaking ceremony back in 1986, but politicians and transit fascists alike pay little heed, the former looking for as many ribbon-cutting photo-ops, and the latter group seeking ultimately to punish those who choose to drive.   Every subsequent extension of the system has fallen victim to this corrupt approach, and there is no end in sight.
We are stuck with a third-rate system design, and no will to fix it.
While the BRU may be mostly a socialist front group, and they may act incoherent at times, they were not wrong when they forced the consent decree; without adequate, timely, and safe bus transport, the system fails the lowest rung of society that is transit-dependent.   Operating and capital budgets are always intentionally fire-walled from each other, but that is not license to punish the poor, or gorge on ego-boosting rail construction.  Unfortunately, Metro and those charged with oversight repeatedly fail to live up to their assignment, and the results are painfully clear for all the world to see.
Greenwald should be celebrated for daring to speak the truth, rather than make excuses for pathetic government performance and wringing his hands as so many here do.
I will agree that the transfer pricing is a downer out but it’s rather intentional by MTA and would need a separate article to discuss in detail.  Other than that point, this article is at best myopic in its viewpoints of public transit in LA and at worst down right idiotic.  Someone falling  (or being pushed) into the pit and killed by a subway has no bearing on people’s “faith in the system.”  I suspect the writer is not a regular user of the MTA’s services, nor does the writer have much appreciation for the herculean efforts it took to get to where we are today.  The funding obstacles and competing interests that were overcome to get the projects like the expo line and subway line were tremendous. To come out with a blanket statement that the system is broken and needs to be “revamped” without any real solutions is pretty reckless in that context.  I fear the author may not take these and the other criticisms in the comments to heart in writing his/her next article and instead fall prey to some misbegotten notion that great journalists are routinely criticized.  No.  THIS was a bad job.  Bad.  Really bad, even if it is just the writer’s “opinion.”
This article is the most conclusory piece of drivel I have seen in a long time.  The author makes no effort to support any of his claims.  The citing of the death at Pershing Square without ANY evidence whatsoever to show that Metro was at fault is totally useless.  Honestly, I am embarrassed to see the DT even publish this garbage.
Was this article funded by the Reason Foundation. Such one sided nonsense. I agree LA’s Metro system need improvement, and they are getting those improvements. I’m glad people are commenting and calling out the one-sidedness of this article and how poorly researched it was.
I grew up in Switzerland, with one of the most phenomenal public transportation systems in the world, and I moved to LA from New York City.  My expectations for the Metro were not high.
That said, I ride the Metro in from Culver City to USC every day.  It leaves exactly when it says it will, every time, and the trip takes exactly 18 minutes every time.  Its reliability has warmed the punctual cockles of my Swiss-raised heart.
As for safety concerns, in 2012 several hundred people were struck by subways in NYC, and 55 of them died.  This will not change ridership in New York, and it will not change ridership in LA either.
And as to cost, as a graduate student at USC, I got a pass for the whole semester (this is not monthly, this is the whole semester, until January 17th) for $85.  A monthly pass on the NYC system is over $100, and there aren’t any discounts available for college students.  Boston’s monthly passes are $70.00/month to ride the T, and the T isn’t much to write home about either in terms of public transportation.  It’s clear that the fare structure with the Metro is designed to incentivize regular ridership.  Once you’ve spent money on a month pass, there’s literally no additional cost to riding the Metro again, which will make you more likely to do so.
All in all, I think LA is approaching this in the right way.  Now they just need to keep expanding the system to really get ridership up.
How many times have you ridden the Metro? As an avid Metro user I completely disagree with all your points. LA Metro is great and the public transportation system here doesn’t get the recognition it deserves. 
People’s ignorance of the $5 day pass and monthly discounts is not Metro’s fault. You are so completely and unfairly biased against the Metro that you have to put a negative spin on something so positive about the system. $5 is cheaper than almost all places you can pay to park at in LA, and don’t forget to add in the cost of gas it takes to get you to and from the destination. I also find it ridiculous that you think it’s bad that they are cracking down on the freeloaders since not paying for a pass is a form of stealing. Is it fair that some people pay and other people don’t pay? $1.50 each way is not pricey at all. You also fail to realize that the working-class people you reference most likely don’t pay the $1.50 rate – they most likely get the $75 monthly pass which reduces the cost if they are using Metro everyday. And don’t blame the Metro for causing more pollution and such. Blame the people who decide to drive everywhere and not use the public transportation system. 
LA Metro is far from “an elitist system, [that] only encourages people to drive their cars to work and create even more smog in the Los Angeles air.” Do you really think that people who can’t afford the $1.50 price can afford to buy a car, pay for car insurance, and pay for gas? 
Do some actual research. Compare the cost of having a car for a month vs. using LA Metro for a month. Compare commute times on LA Metro vs. sitting on the freeway in rush hour traffic. LA Metro will come out cheaper and the commute time will most likely be the same, or perhaps even faster.
Clearly, the writer is not a Metro rider. The LA Metro is a great way to get around. Yes the lines are not as extensive as NY, but the system is only about 15 years old. Sorry $3 is expensive??? Have you driven a car in LA? $3 is cheap even for poor people. The people that have stopped riding were never going to pay anyway. even if it was only 60 cents. Get real!
I agree with many of  the points made by Ras and Richard T – the writer comes off as an infrequent rider at most, with little knowledge of the system and why certain things are set up the way they are.
Using the incident at Pershing Square as an indication of Metro’s safety is unwise, seeing as hardly any hard facts about the accident have been reported, aside from the news that the man was “struck/run over by a train.” Was the man having health issues? Was he attacked? Was it suicide? You need those answers to support your claim.
You don’t like that the train stops at red lights? Talk to LADOT. Except it’s gonna be tough, because since L.A. is so fixated on cars, any proposal to prioritize trains over motorized vehicles will be an uphill battle, to say the least.
As for transfers and paying for each ride: transfers are part of public transportation. Period. And in L.A., with the rail lines’ present limited scope, it’s likely you’ll have to transfer at least once during your commute. If it becomes a problem financially to pay for each ride, that’s what the day, weekly, and monthly passes are for. And they are moderately priced when compared to other major cities.
It’s easy to say that more buses, faster trains, and lower fares would magically make things better, but it’s not that simple. They could have built the Blue and Expo lines underground or elevated so they would never have to worry about stop lights – and it would have cost hundreds, maybe even billions more dollars than they already did. Where was that extra cash going to come from?
It all comes down to money and the fact is every train (and probably bus) that runs loses money. More trains/buses means less money. Granted, operating efficiency may be gained by extending service further to put more bodies on a train (and therefore more fares) to a certain extent, but you’re also adding fixed costs in terms of track, signal, and station maintenance. At the end of the day, they’re still losing money, and any gains (reductions in loss) from increased operational efficiency probably won’t cover the finance costs of the organizations share of the expansions capital costs.
If what you want is more service, you need to look to the past when we had decent transportation services and compare it to today. Back then, these services were privately operated, because transporting people was a profitable enterprise. Who was their competition? Well the railroads competed with other railroad companies, and also competed with the trolley/interurban companies. That competition was what motivated these private operators to provide good services. Industry regulation back then wasn’t particularly burdensome, and they didn’t take a dime of taxes for operating costs until the end of their corporate lives.
Let’s fast forward to today. What limited services exist are operated by one taxpayer-subsidized government organization (along with several municipal bus services), because it is no longer profitable. Service doesn’t go nearly everywhere it used to, and the quality of the service often leaves much to be desired. There’s really no competition in terms of mass-transportation services, because they’re pretty much the only game in town. Therefore, when they fail to provide you with acceptable service, you have no alternative but to complain. And that does very little to change things.
Los Angeles has come a long way with transportation, but there is still a lot of work to be done. The current Metro system is not perfect, but it works. It just takes a little time and a little work. However, until more of us are willing to put that in, it’s going to be a longer time before we see some of the changes you ask for in your article.
Ever ride the bus? Why not? Ok. I have heard all the complaints.
And I’m not buying it. Say what you will about delays, longer trip times, bad odors and “all the weird people” who ride the bus. Folks, if you are not riding the bus you really are missing out on a wonderful opportunity.
Why is it a wonderful opportunity you may ask? Let’s break it down. First, riding the bus is better for the world at large and second, riding the bus is better for you.
Before we get started I ask that you read this post to the end because I have a feeling most people are too wrapped up in attachment to their own beliefs to even consider reading about reasons to ride the bus.
So don’t hang up on me now, please hear me out because if not now, then someday you might wake up and recognize the truths I will share with you.
 Always Ask Why
Riding the bus is better for your neighborhood, city, state, country, and world. Because the more people that ride the bus, then the less air pollution there will be. Right on! Less cars equals less carbon emissions. I know that you care about the environment, but do you act that way? If you never take the bus when you could then you are not acting as if you care about the environment.
Simple as that. We all care. Few of us do much about it. Telling yourself you care and not acting that you care; is that hypocritical or just plain lazy? At least if you admit to one or the other you are not in denial.
Are you feeling guilty yet? Change is more likely to occur if the approach to change is not fear based, but incentive based. So lets get to some personal incentives and benefits.
This could actually be a case of “I feel good about myself because I am doing something good for the world,” in other words we all sleep better at night knowing we are making a contribution and by not always driving when you can ride is making a contribution. Every little bit helps, many hands make light work.
Let’s talk about money. Money doesn’t grow on trees, you work for it, so why should you waste it? Yes, riding the bus saves you MONEY! Who knew?
Forget about the money for a second, what about the psychic currency paid to you for not driving. Oh yes this gets deep. I am not dissing cars. In fact I like to have one while I am on vacation! And I am not dissing marriage for obvious reasons. I would like to say that owning a car is like being married to a spouse.
We are so attached to them, like our spouses. If not a particular car, then to the idea of owning and driving a car. We are always worried, concerned or paying attention to them. Is there gas? When did I last change the oil? Are the tires inflated properly? Are my brake pads ready for replacement? Do my wipers actually clear the windshield when the rain is pouring? Do I need a tune-up? Did I make my insurance payment? Did I make my car payment? When do I renew my license? Did I pay that ticket?  Do I have enough cash flow this week to get some routine maintenance? When is the last time I washed my car? Is the inside of my car too cluttered? What’s that new rattle? Did I just run over a nail and now I have tire noise? Oh wow my tire treads are wearing thin, time to get four new ones about $600 minimum. What if someone steals my car? Am I going to get a parking ticket? You got any quarters on you? Oh man a traffic cop is about to pull me over…bummer…you get the idea…the list goes on…your vehicle, believe it or not is a 24/7 serious responsibility and there is no way around that.
Drive Less Stress Less
By not having a car or driving less all those missives just mentioned could be off your back. That saves you money and stress too. The less stress of not having to deal with all those car relationship issues can be truly liberating. That is the psychic currency I am talking about.
Finally, think about this fact of stress. You are it. You drive, you are responsible. What if you are in the wrong place at the wrong time going the wrong speed. You die. A terrible price to pay when you would be much safer on the bus. You see the other guy is the one not paying attention or making poor judgements while driving. That does not matter because you will still be dead.
Driving is serious work. You have to pay attention. You have to make moves. Poor judgement on your part can cost you big time. Not paying attention can cost you even more. Watching out, turning, gunning it, stopping, gunning it again, checking left, checking right, then checking left again that is stress.
So as you drive you stress. As it should be, because driving is a big responsibility taking care of precious cargo, that is, you, your wife and your child. So take a load off, enjoy a more stress free life, in fact live longer by not driving.
Oh did I mention the interesting and beautiful people that you can meet on the bus? You would NEVER meet them if you are stuck in your steel womb cocoon know as an automobile. I will save “the meet the interesting and beautiful people bus riding” post for another day.
And one more thing, you can actually look out the window. You can literally see the world without blinders. Sorry drivers, eyes on the road, hands on the wheel. Riders get the view, drivers pay their dues. The views are nice, try them sometime, you might see some amazing things. Only if you have an open mind though.
Thanks for reading and considering where the “other side” really is “greener.” And thank you for walking or biking and then taking the bus!
This article is very poorly written and researched. It reads very typical of an article about Metro from someone living in LA. 
Among the funniest points – the writer mentions that people who are used to cheating the system and not paying for their ride – find it harder to do so since Metro cracked down. This resulted in less freeloaders…uhhhh – and your point is? BTW, people who can not afford cars, but steal cars will find it harder to do so when LAPD cracks down on GTA. Is your point we should just let some people pay and other people who do not wish to pay – they do not have to and their cost of commuting is being subsidized by the ones who do responsibly pay. I can see which side of the political spectrum you veg out on. 
The accident at Pershing is as much a deterrent for regular commuters as the 40,000 car related accident deaths are to drivers.
If you compare the price of a $75/month pass – against ANY major city – you will see the price to commute in LA is minuscule. The writer failed to mention this price amount in the article.
Lastly – the writer says Metro needs to lower its prices so the lower income people can ride metro. Well who the hell do you think rides the Metro now? Rich people? 
I hate people who will opine on something like the Metro when they clearly do not use it. If you took the train once as a novel experience in LA – don’t spout a bunch of opinions that you have no idea on how to execute. 
As is already, Metro’s budget is cutting buses and having them crammed full of people during much of the day. With less money like you propose – how does this magically get funded – pixie dust and unicorn breath?
An opinion piece must be based on empirical facts than perception.
The article cites a man who was killed at Pershing Square with no mention of the circumstances. Did somebody push him? Did he trip? Was he blind? That contextual information would have explained how, in the writers opinion, that the subway system is “dangerous”. Is the Metro more dangerous than other transit systems in other major cities? Is there something specific that makes the LA worse than other systems?
Also, how exactly did the incident cause “commuters to lose faith in public transportation”? Is there a study that shows commuter confidence to show this?
The buses and subways follow a fixed schedule; while additional service is needed on many lines, the “agonizingly slow” doesn’t make sense. Does the article suggest on-time performance is poor?
The conclusion in the article that scofflaws are somehow victims of increased fare enforcement is ridiculous.
The writer forgot to mention how poorly designed, inefficient, awkward and confusing the TAP web site is.
It looks as if it was designed by a high schooler as a class project.
Very non-intuitive and inflexible, to add $30 cash you have to do two completely separate transactions, one for $20 and one for $10. It does not save your information, you have to re-enter it every time (even though you have to log in), you can only do one card at the time, even if you have more than one on your account, the “continue” button is on the top not on the bottom where you’d expect, I can go on and on about it.
They need to update the site and make it friendlier desperately!
Great article, and nice touch with the colorful language. LA public transit is a joke, a train stopping at red lights on a regular…please. The overcrowded expensive buses are even worse. But regarding the cost, as a poster said, it can’t be made cheaper. They should just subsidized transportation at a higher rate, that will bring the price down and increase ridership. Eventually with the increased ridership they can reduce the subsidies and be come financially sustainable.
This was so poorly written and researched it hurts. Besides, Metro can’t afford to lower prices, it already operates at a loss and the boost in ridership wouldn’t exactly make up for that.

Martin Manley knew he didn’t want to live past 60. The thought of growing old alone or suffering from imminent health problems terrified him, and didn’t want to wait around for his last years. So, on Aug. 15, Manley decided to take control of his fate and committed suicide in a police station parking lot in a suburb outside of Kansas City, Kan.
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
 
Though most suicides are met with painful questions that can never be answered, Manley ensured that those questions would never have to be asked. The blogger and former sports reporter left behind something other than a typical handwritten suicide note: for more than a year, Manley had been secretly creating an intricate website about his life, including an explanation of his decision to end it.
The website is extensive, with 34 categories and 44 subcategories that allow readers to sift through the various time periods and areas of interest of Manley’s life. Perhaps most disturbing, however, is Manley’s in-depth explanations and testimonials as to why he took his own life and why he decided to create a website to be published on the day of his death.
“After you die, you can be remembered by a few-line obituary for one day in a newspaper when you’re too old to matter to anyone anyway … OR you can be remembered for years by a site such as this,” Manley writes on his website. “That was my choice and I chose the obvious.”
Though Manley prepaid Yahoo to host the site for five years, Yahoo claimed that the material was “harmful” to users and proceeded to take the site down, according to a report by CNN. And while it is possible that viewers could find the site to be overly morbid and argue that it encourages suicide, this is a complete disregard for Manley’s final wishes. Manley specifically states on the site that encouraging suicide was not his intent.
His main goal was to leave a piece of himself behind and to be immortalized on the Internet for years to come, and this goal should be respected. He wanted to not only provide an explanation for his act of self-destruction, but also preserve his life online forever. He explained his likes and dislikes, the story of his first love, his theories and thoughts on complicated issues, and so much more.
He wanted the world to know his story, and he deserves to be given that. Authors, artists and celebrities are often immortalized in their work — why shouldn’t everyone be allowed that same amount of self-preservation? The web opens up all sorts of opportunities for the average Joes and Martin Manleys of the world to leave a piece of themselves behind after they have passed away — Everyone wants to be remembered.
The Internet has become an integral part of our lives, and irreversibly entangled with the goings-on of the physical world, as users continue to post daily updates to sites and blogs about their daily activities as well as major life events. In the current digital age, people share the joys and sorrows of their lives through the Internet. Deaths should be no exception.
Yahoo deemed the site inappropriate, but what they failed to realize is how very appropriate sites such as these can be: Death is a part of life, and it too has its place on the web.
“Even one generation back, so little is really known about the vast, vast majority of people,” Manley wrote. “It’s a shame — especially considering existing technology has enabled us to store everything ever said, done or thought by every person on earth a thousand times over. There is no reason lives have to continue to be forever forgotten.”
Manley is right. The Internet does allow a sort of everlasting time capsule for those wishing to leave behind a legacy. Though the conditions of Manley’s death were unfavorable and should not be an inspiration to others, he revealed the Internet’s capacity to preserve a memory and help loved ones cope with a loss. Yahoo and other website providers should recognize and embrace the web’s potential not only to celebrate users during their lives, but also in their deaths.

USC women’s volleyball freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu was named Pac-12 Freshman of the Week on Monday for her performance in the Women of Troy’s season-opening Mortar Board Premier tournament victory in West Lafayette, Ind.
In wins over No. 16 Purdue, No. 21 Western Kentucky and Alabama A&M, Nwanebu averaged 3.75 kills, 1.12 blocks and 4.44 points per set for the No. 4 Trojans (3-0) and was selected to the all-tournament team.
Nwanebu made her presence felt in her first collegiate match with a team-high 15 kills and eight blocks in USC’s win over host Purdue. The nation’s No. 1 recruit in the class of 2013 had 20 points and hit .424 with just one error to help the Women of Troy topple the Boilermakers in four sets.
In the next match against Western Kentucky, Nwanebu again led the team with 13 kills on 24 swings for a .458 hitting percentage. Nwanebu only played in the first set against Alabama A&M and had two kills on four swings.
This is the sixth time that a member of the team has earned Pac-12 Freshman of the Week honors, with sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio winning the award five times last season.
Bricio, the MVP of the Mortar Board Premier tournament, was a nominee for the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week award after posting 25 kills, 11 digs and seven blocks over the weekend.
The Women of Troy will take on TCU and Marquette during the Marquette Challenge in Milwaukee, Wis. on Friday before facing Northern Illinois on the road on Saturday.

USC senior defensive end Devon Kennard was named the Lott IMPACT Player of the Week on Monday for his outstanding play in the team’s 30-13 victory over Hawai’i to open the 2013 season.
In a game that the Trojan defense dominated, Kennard recorded three tackles, including two tackles for loss and one sack, two pass breakups and one quarterback hurry.
The Lott IMPACT Trophy is awarded to a defensive college player at the end of the year to the player who displays the best personal character and athletic performance.
Before the season began, Kennard was named to the Lott Trophy Award watch list.
Kennard is a fifth-year senior who was sidelined all of last season because of a torn pectoral muscle injury.
The 6-foot-3, 255-pound Kennard started his career at USC as a defensive end but was moved to outside linebacker at the end of his freshman year. In his sophomore season, he was shifted again to middle linebacker, then moved back to defensive end his junior year.
Now, Kennard plays in a sort of defensive end/outside linebacker hybrid spot that better suits his skill set.
Kennard was voted to be one of the team captains for this season along with Hayes Pullard, Marcus Martin and Marqise Lee.
The Lott IMPACT Trophy was named in honor of Ronnie Lott — a two time All-American who played for the USC Trojans. Lott went on to win four Super Bowl rings with the San Francisco 49ers, 10 trips to the Pro Bowl and a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
