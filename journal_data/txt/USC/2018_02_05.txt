Despite having a similar start to the game on Friday, the women’s basketball team played a very different game last night against the No. 8 Bruins. UCLA started with a 9-0 run, similar to their 10-0 start on Friday, but the Trojans would not need to call a timeout before scoring this time around. From the first quarter, the team would battle back and forth, keeping the game close for the majority. While the Trojans still came up short tonight by 14 points, USC kept the game competitive and forced the Bruins to step up in order to take home another victory.

“They’re the No. 9 [sic] team in the country for a reason and you look at the program that they have and their coach is close to her sixth season and she’s done a heck of a job building the program,” head coach Mark Trakh said, “I am really happy in that we are competing with everybody and playing hard.”
One of the biggest differences between the two games came from an unexpected place: the USC bench. The Trojans’ starters have almost all been playing full games or close to it. However, when senior forward Kristin Simon went down in the first quarter, it was junior forward Marguerite Effa who would step up and make key plays for the Trojans, including scoring their first points of the game on an and one. While Simon would return to the game, foul trouble would bring Effa back in the second quarter and again in the fourth after Simon fouled out. By the end of the game, she would play 20 minutes and finish 100 percent from the free-throw line and with 7 points.
“She went out there and it was the longest run that she’s gotten and she was huffing and puffing, but man she kept her cool and made free throws, got to the line, got a couple of rebounds,” Trakh said. “[Effa] is athletic. We get to work with her all summer and she’s just a great kid who wants to learn and we got her a little late, we got her in September, but now we will have her all spring and all summer and I think she will be a contributor next year.”
Even with a bigger contribution from the bench, the Trojans still had UCLA’s Monique Billings to face. Billings maintained her team’s 11-point lead into the half with 12 points, just 2 points shy of her total score on Friday night. The Bruins would carry that momentum into the third quarter, keeping the Trojans at bay for most of it. Billings would end the game with yet another double-double, with 18 points, 11 rebounds and three blocks. Her performance reflects her athleticism, but doesn’t detract from the play on the part of the Trojans. They finished the game still proud of the effort they showed last night and are certainly not disappointed in how they fared against her and her team these last two games.
“I think that in both games we fought really hard,” said sophomore guard Minyon Moore. “I think it was our effort. That taught me in this game that at any second we could come back and we can work hard. I think that we just got into a little bit of foul trouble. I think we learned a lot whether that is rebounding, whether it’s stopping them in transition, stopping the point guard, I think we learned a lot and it is going to help us move forward.”
Yet, the Bruins certainly did not blow the Trojans out. A strong surge from the Trojans coming with three minutes left in the third quarter would take them into the 4th down by only 5 points. Spearheaded by Moore, the team would get the stops they needed to cut the lead down, but also change the momentum of the game for a time.
“I looked at my point guard to my left here and she competed and she played hard and she ran the team and she had a positive attitude the whole time,” Trakh said. “[Simon] came in and hit a couple three’s and made some shots for us … I’m just really really proud of the kids and we will just keep plugging away, doing what we can do.”
That Trojan intensity would continue into the 4th quarter, where the Trojans would bring it to a 1-point game at 69-68 with four and a half minutes left. However, the Bruins responded with an 10-0 run, harkening back to the intensity they showed both offensively and defensively at the beginning of the game. USC’s dry spell would end with the conversion two free throws by junior guard Aliyah Mazyck with two minutes left of regulation. But they would ultimately be the last points they scored the rest of the game.
“I definitely look at this as a learning experience,” Moore said. “I’m not down and our team’s not down. Sometimes you lose and sometimes you win, so you just have to go out there and try and win the next one. Honestly, I think our team showed effort and you can’t really get mad when we show effort.”

The No. 14 USC men’s volleyball will host conference rival Stanford on Thursday night.
Junior libero Matt Douglas leads the Men of Troy with 53 digs in the 2018 season. Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
After a disappointing 0-2 road trip in Illinois, USC looks to put behind a rough 3-7 start to its season when it plays Stanford in just the second home game of the year for the Trojans. Having lost in three and four sets to Lewis and Loyola-Chicago, USC is searching for a much-needed win to regain some confidence in a team that is slowly tumbling in the national rankings. 
Stanford is coming off its second win of the season to a respectable UC San Diego team, but the Cardinal’s potential, like USC’s, may not be fully realized yet. Five of Stanford’s losses have been to top-10 teams, including Ohio State, Cal State Northridge, UC Irvine and twice to No. 1 Long Beach State. 
Stanford is also led by some very talented yet inexperienced underclassmen. Sophomore outside hitter Eric Beatty had a strong showing last game with a career-high 18 kills, one ace, one block and seven digs while hitting .364. Another key player is freshman outside hitter Jaylen Jasper, who recorded 14 kills, two aces  and four digs over the Tritons. Junior setter Russell Dervay also had a career-high 45 assists and eight digs as Stanford hit a season best .339. 
USC’s trio of junior outside hitters Jack Wyett, Ryan Moss and Gianluca Grasso, and freshman middle blocker Sam Lewis, led the Trojans in their last game. Wyett recorded a match-high 16 kills, eight digs and two blocks. Moss had nine kills, six digs, two blocks and an ace, while Grasso chipped in with six kills, five digs and two blocks. Lewis hit .333 while accumulating 10 kills and two blocks. 
With the Cardinal and Trojans trending in opposite directions, it is crucial that USC sets the tone early and maintains a good offensive rhythm from the start of the match. In both matches last week, USC started strong, narrowly falling to Lewis by an absurd score of 42-40 and beating Loyola-Chicago 25-20 in the first set. However, the Trojans looked increasingly fatigued as the matches wore on, as the margin of defeat slowly grew each time. It will be interesting to see how head coach Jeff Nygaard adjusts his rotations to keep the energy up the entire game.

It’s been a big week for the underdogs.
That nickname has stuck with the Philadelphia Eagles for weeks now, ever since the first-time offensive tackle Lane Johnson donned a German Shepherd mask in the end zone of a playoff game. 
The image was rather macabre — a burly lineman shaped like a soda machine, with a plastic dog head askew on his broad shoulders — but it sold an idea that quickly became a mantra for the team. Over the past weeks, the Eagles’ success has been accompanied by a sea of German Shepherd, pug and poodle masks as the fans of Philadelphia fully embraced and celebrated their role as the league’s underdogs. 
It was fitting for a team whose odds were low for every game of the playoffs. It was even more fitting in the Super Bowl, for a team that had never won, playing the team that has become one of the greatest juggernauts of the game. When it comes to football, everyone is an underdog against Tom Brady and the Patriots.
Let me just say this. No one could have predicted this ending. No one could have foreseen that Carson Wentz, well on his way to a MVP trophy, would take a hard hit in a game that meant little-to-nothing, then never return to the field. No one could have predicted that a backup quarterback, who struggled to find his rhythm in his initial starts, would string together a series of improbable playoff victories.
And similarly, no one could have predicted that Super Bowl game. Tom Brady tore it up with 505 yards, three touchdowns and zero interceptions, but the Eagles somehow still beat the greatest quarterback in the league? Unheard of. Run a trick play on 4th and goal to give your backup quarterback the first reception — not to mention touchdown — of his life? You’ve got to be kidding me. Win the game on a high-flying, almost-too-good-to-be-true dive into the end zone? This sounds like a deleted scene from the Disney classic Invincible, rather than an actual, real life football game.
But this is the season that Philly has been waiting for over the last five decades, over a dry spell that has lasted the entire lifetime of the Super Bowl and the entire lifetime of almost every resident of the city. Philadelphia fans are many things — loyal, passionate and, yes, more than a little crazy — but above all they have been patient in waiting for this final, inevitable coronation. And they did it without any of the legacy or royalty that the Patriots brought to the table.
Take, for example, the head coach, the man who made the 4th and goal “Philly Special” play call that will probably go down as one of the greatest and gutsiest decisions in Super Bowl history. Ten years ago, Pederson was preparing for spring ball at a high school in Louisiana, game planning how to break into the state playoffs again. He was used to being held to the sidelines, a guy who played backup quarterback his whole life. Now, in only his second season at the helm of the Eagles, he’s got everything a coach could ask for — a loyal fan following, two stud quarterbacks and a Super Bowl ring to boot.
“Our coach has got some guts, huh?” said tight end Trey Burton, who threw that touchdown pass to Foles. “Got some big ones.”
Everyone from Pederson down to the water boys had a reason to bring a chip on their shoulder into the game. But what’s amazing about what the Eagles did is that they didn’t play as if they were the underdogs. From the start, they gave the Patriots a taste of their own medicine — efficient drives with a mix of that slashing RPO attack paired with deep bombs from Foles — and put New England in a hole early on.
Despite the David and Goliath setting of the game, the Eagles never faltered or seemed overwhelmed by the challenge ahead of them. Even Brady described the game as feeling out of his control. And perhaps that’s why it felt like such an uncharacteristic showing for the Patriots — for a team used to dominating, especially in late-game, high-stakes situations, this was a complete turning of the tables.
It’s a bit of an annual pastime for football fans whose teams long ago fell out of Super Bowl contention to cheer against Brady and the Patriots. They are, after all, the Evil Empire of the league, the proverbial Bad Guys who are easy enough to hate. But this year, I saw something different unfold.
I watched the game at a friend’s house with a crowd of about 30. Only two people were cheering for the Patriots, per  usual, but the rest of the crowd was resoundingly cheering for the Eagles. It was similar to the 2016 World Series, when everyone in America seemed to agree that if you weren’t cheering for the Cubs, well, you didn’t have much of a heart. 
Everyone had their own reason to cheer for the Eagles — they’re a fan of Nelson Agholor, the former USC star and current Eagles wide receiver; or of Julie Ertz, the World Cup champion and wife of the tight end who caught that final touchdown pass; or of Malcolm Jenkins, whose political activism has earned attention and respect throughout the league this season. But the core of the support came down to those dog heads that Johnson and his team wore with such pride. Everyone loves an underdog.
In yet another year when we all needed a story of the little guy winning big, the Eagles came through to deliver one for the ages, complete with a storybook finish right down to the very last seconds. And while the true fans are still probably recovering from their celebrations (RIP to most of the major streets in Philadelphia), for the rest of us, the truth about this Super Bowl is settling in — we were all lucky to witness a classic.

For many years now, my family — composed of many veterans from the Navy, Army and Marines — has instilled in me a reverence for the military, a sense of respect for those who risk their lives for my safety. And for many years now, I have returned the favor with simple gestures, like thanking people in uniform when I see them in the grocery store. 
I have become increasingly aware of the strange relationship between Americans and those who serve. Sure, many wave a flag on their front porches in support of the troops abroad. I bet they even cried when watching Saving Private Ryan. But would they give a few bucks to a homeless veteran on the street? Probably not. Would they ever serve in the military themselves? Absolutely not.
Admittedly, I am a part of this problem. Whether they want to believe it or not, many Americans — and the policymakers above them — may readily vocalize their support for those who serve, but in reality, they fall drastically short in providing veterans with the help they deserve.
This is especially true concerning mental health. Last month, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine released a report on the status of military veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan era. Underlined in their chief findings was the fact that there is a “substantial unmet need for mental health services” among the veterans surveyed.
To be more specific, roughly half of veterans feel they aren’t getting the help they need. That means roughly half of those who suffer are not being supported by the very people for whom they risked their lives. This a problem, and it must be fixed now.
To tackle this issue, we must first address the stigma associated with mental illness. As alluded to before, many people romanticize the image of the soldier, but reject what they become after serving. Our society says that soldiers aren’t supposed to be needy; they are supposed to satisfy our needs.
Effren Villanueva | Daily Trojan
On the bright side, common conditions like Post Traumatic Stress — a case of extreme anxiety triggered by the trauma of combat — have become increasingly legitimized as mental illnesses over the years. PTS was not a commonly used term before the 1980s, but it certainly existed. Once diagnosed as “shell shock,” an understatement of the condition’s severity, PTS has alternated titles — “combat exhaustion,” “stress response syndrome” — until the term “post traumatic stress disorder” stuck. Recently, many doctors and experts have dropped the term “disorder” from the name due to its negative connotation.
Changing the name of the condition does not address the deeper issue. Destigmatizing mental health is certainly a priority, but it is not enough to simply understand that PTS is a problem. The reality is that efforts by the government to support veterans have been largely ineffective. 
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has previously been accused of failing to provide health services to which many veterans are guaranteed. The mental health section of the organization’s website reads: “Because suicide prevention is the Department of Veterans Affairs’ top clinical priority, it is important for former service members to know there is some place they can turn if they are facing a mental health emergency.”
If mental health is such a priority, then why do nearly half of veterans feel they aren’t getting the support they need? The key word in the quote above is “emergency”: Many veterans cannot find assistance unless there is an absolute crisis, and even then, there is a high chance of facing a closed door.
To address this problem, President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month that intends to expand the VA’s mental health services department to reach new veterans, prioritizing suicide prevention in particular. This is a step in the right direction, and hopefully the VA will streamline its system to satisfy the increased number of clients. 
But there is some support available to those who look for it. Two years ago, I had the opportunity to intern at the Veterans Legal Institute, a law firm co-founded by its president, Antoinette Balta and USC Gould School of Law professor Dwight Stirling. The firm, which offers pro bono services to thousands of struggling veterans in Southern California, is a shining example of the progress that can be made if veterans’ voices are heard. 
During my internship, I experienced the miserable atmosphere of the VA hospital. But I also watched many desperate veterans come through the door of a small law office and walk out with a new sense of hope, and a new life ahead of them. Throughout my entire experience, I was uplifted by the genuine care and support my coworkers gave to clients in need.
It is time that more of us start caring as well. It is time that more of us stop blindly waving our flags and start listening to the cries for help from the low-income, homeless and mentally ill veterans in our communities. It is time that more of us serve those who serve us.

It has been just over two years since United Nations representatives from 43 countries gathered in Paris for COP21. At the historic gathering, legislators successfully ratified the Paris Accords — an international agreement to combat climate change by tightening quotas on greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, the meeting itself served as a monumental symbol: A collaboration among leaders to address the concerns of environmentalism and work toward a compromise.
At a more micro level, the United States is failing to progress beyond the achievements made by COP21. If anything, the actions ­— or lack thereof — of current leadership indicate a clear carelessness toward the very real and present dangers of global warming. President Donald Trump’s administration, for instance, announced this past June — before Hurricane Harvey, the most devastating fires in California’s history and other natural disasters which resulted in an estimated $306 billion in damages — that the United States would withdraw its commitment to the Paris Agreement and, furthermore, its efforts toward climate change mitigation.
When this sort of disregard is modeled by governments, it not only becomes permissible but also is adopted by other institutions. USC is no exception.
Whether recognized or not, excess and wastefulness are surely defining hallmarks of USC culture — one only needs to look around to see it: Building lights, even when not in-use, are regularly left on; recycling bins are almost nowhere to be found along Trousdale Parkway or the campus’ other walkways; the University itself boasts of the fact that it houses trees from all 50 states, neglecting the environmental damage that can result from introducing non-native species to new ecosystems.
A food waste audit conducted by the University’s Environmental Core last year found that, from the more than 2,400 individuals who entered and exited EVK dining hall throughout the course of one day, roughly 470 pounds of total waste. Of that total, about 240 pounds consisted of non-animal food waste and another 80 pounds consisted of animal food waste.
Though this study is not quite comprehensive — it is simply a recording of observations from a single day — it does offer startling insights into the daily, unrecognized behavior of students and staff alike, of wasting and disposing unsustainably and blindly continuing to do so.
A lack of administrative effort is likely the source of these wasteful campus practices. 
Since Fall 2017, the University’s Office of Sustainability has remained nearly unstaffed. Halli Bovia, the University’s former director of sustainability, resigned last October. This was followed by the resignations of Jessica Cohen and Erin Fabris, the Facilities Management Services’ Waste and Recycling Administrator and Housing’s Sustainability Coordinator, respectively. While the position formerly held by Bovia is in the process of being rehired, those of Cohen and Fabris may or may not be restaffed. 
Surely, students’ environmentalist efforts cannot come to fruition if there are no resources going toward the cause. 
Student organizations like the Environmental Student Assembly are already working to spearhead change on campus — whether it be through simply informing students or linking them up with clubs like the Environmental Core or The Sustainability Project, they are providing students with opportunities to recognize and change their wasteful habits. Yet, without any resources and support from administration, these hopes for progress will fail to become reality.
What the University needs is not necessarily a change of mindset. The mindset is already there. In theory, as a collective, the University is committed to environmentalist causes, or at least to the aesthetics of environmentalism. We like the idea of being “green.” We recognize the importance of conservation. We do not consider ourselves to be wasteful, and, more likely than not, do not actively try to be so. 
What the University needs, therefore, is a change in practice: a task that is obviously easier said than done, but a task that will nonetheless require partnership between students and faculty. 
There needs to be a response when students reach out to staff, and this, of course, requires that a staff is present. When it comes to campus sustainability, the issue seems to have fallen off the agenda when, in fact, it is one that affects not just students and staff, but all individuals. Simply put, there is no locality to environmental degradation. The fact that the University has all the necessary resources is one matter, but whether the University decides to utilize them properly is something else entirely.

USC’s six-game conference winning streak was snapped with a thrilling 82-79 loss to UCLA in Westwood. Despite leading the game for over 25 minutes, USC was on the short end of the scoreboard at the end of the game. 
The Trojans (17-7 overall, 8-3 in Pac-12) have now lost their last three contests to the Bruins, dating back to last season. 
“It hurts, we hate losing,” senior guard Jordan McLaughlin said. “That’s all we can really say, it just hurts.” 
With 10  seconds remaining in regulation and trailing by three, the Trojans still had a chance to send the contest to overtime. McLaughlin’s possible game-tying 3-pointer clanked off the iron as a miss. Just seconds later, freshman guard Jordan Usher put up another 3-point field goal attempt, only to air ball as time on the clock expired. 
“We played hard enough to win that game, we just missed some shots down the stretch,” Trojans head coach Andy Enfield said. “And [UCLA] made a couple. Both teams played at a high level. That was a great college basketball game.”
Shortly before Usher’s air ball, USC had an opportunity to win the game with under 30 seconds left in play. After a pair of free throws from senior guard Elijah Stewart, the Trojans trailed the Bruins by a point, 80-79.
On the ensuing Trojans possession, redshirt junior guard Shaqquan Aaron fired a jump shot that entirely missed the basket and was rebounded by UCLA (16-7, 7-4) with 11 seconds remaining in regulation. 
USC would intentionally foul, and the Bruins would extend their lead to the final score of 82-79 on free throws from senior center Thomas Welsh. 
Welsh, who hit the go-ahead 3-pointer for UCLA with under one minute left in play, finished Saturday with 21 points (8-of-15 FG) and eight rebounds. UCLA junior guard Aaron Holiday recorded a game-high 23 points (7-of-10 FG). Holiday scored 10 points in the final 10 minutes of the game, providing a late boost for the Bruins. 
Offensive droughts for USC came at the most inopportune times. Over the final 3:12 in regulation, the Trojans missed six of the final seven shots they attempted. 
“A lot of [the misses] were just in the rim, in-and-out … It was just frustrating,” said Stewart, who scored 12 points in the second half. “We kept trying to feed the post, [UCLA] was guarding pretty well … Shots just didn’t open up.” 
A layup from Stewart gave USC a 69-60 lead with just over eight minutes left in play. The following four minutes saw USC shoot 1-for-5 from the floor and score just 3 points. UCLA capitalized by going on a 13-3 run, which gave them a 73-72 lead over USC with under four minutes remaining. 
Midway through the first half, sophomore guard Jonah Mathews hit a 3-point field goal that gave the Trojans what would be their largest lead of the entire game at 27-16. Another offensive coldspell hit USC, as the team would score only one field goal over the next seven-plus minutes. 
Offensively, UCLA put together a complete game. The Bruins finished Saturday shooting 29-of-57 (51 percent) from the field. From beyond the arc, UCLA converted on 12-of-26 (46 percent) shot attempts. 
“The [defense] was just not quite there,” Enfield said. “[We can’t] allow the opponent to shoot 51 percent from the field.” 
Offensively, USC was able to finish the game shooting 30-for-70 (43 percent) overall from the field. 
After missing the last two games due to a foot injury, junior forward Bennie Boatwright returned to action against UCLA. In nine minutes, Boatwright recorded 2 points on 0-of-5 shooting from the field. 
Four Trojans scored in double figures Saturday: Stewart (team-high 20 points), Aaron (14 points), sophomore forward Nick Rakocevic (14 points) and junior forward Chimezie Metu (11 points).
Aaron scored 12 of his 14 total points in the first eight minutes of the contest, as USC raced out to an early double-digit lead over UCLA. 
In a losing effort, the Trojans out-rebounded the opponent, 38-32. USC received double-double efforts from Metu, who recorded a game-high 12 rebounds, and Rakocevic, who reeled in 10 boards. 
A pair of layups late in the first half from Stewart gave the Trojans a narrow 41-40 lead at the half. 
USC was able to convert on UCLA’s 12 turnovers, scoring 16 points off of the Bruins’ turnover miscues. 
Despite the loss, the Trojans are still in second place in Pac-12 standings behind No. 9 Arizona (19-4, 9-1).
The Trojans will stay on the road this week, as they travel to Arizona to battle a pair of Pac-12 opponents in Arizona State (16-6, 4-6) and Arizona. 
“We’ve been doing this for a while …. We’ve been through it all,” Stewart said. “Still hasn’t broke us. We can get stronger.”

The women’s basketball team took on No. 9 UCLA at Pauley Pavilion Friday evening in the first of two back-to-back meetings. While the Bruins protected their home court with a 59-46 victory, the Trojans fought hard against a team with two of the top players in the country.

The Bruins came out strong with a 10-0 run for the lead, in which they wouldn’t lose. However, USC showed they were not going to back down and stayed competitive until the very end.
“It was a defensive game and they jumped on us early,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “They got up and did a really good job defensively. I felt like we came back and cut it to nine to start the fourth and you know, we’ve got like an iron woman five that plays a lot of minutes for us and they play hard and you know they get after it.”
The five starters continued their trend of playing full game minutes, aside from junior guard Aliyah Mazyck who got into early foul trouble. 
Senior forward Kristen Simon played 38 of the 40 minutes and finished with her 26th career double-double with 15 points and 12 rebounds. Simon’s main task was containing and getting past UCLA star forward Monique Billings. 
While Billings had the height advantage, Simon’s ability to fight for rebounds and make plays kept her and her team in the game. Despite her stature, Simon proved that she is a force to be reckoned with in every game.
“[Simon] is like Billings,” Trakh said. “She is a walking double-double. That kid has got a huge heart and she just battles all the time being undersized … She’s just strong and I thought in that game when we first started that she would be undersized and they would defensively be a problem, but she’s been a great defensive player for us too, so I am very very proud of what [Simon] is able to do. She’s just been a great kid to coach.”
While the Trojans fell short on Friday, they have another chance to face the Bruins. This time though, they will play at the Galen Center with their home crowd behind them. Even though it is a quick turnaround, the team is able to make the changes they need, while the loss is fresh on their minds. 
“We’re building and we just gotta keep working and keep grinding and hopefully at our place we will be able to knock down a few more shots,” Trakh said. “But, you know, we scored 46 points … They’ve been doing a really really good job, so we’ve got to watch the tapes, make adjustments …. It’s hard to contain them athletically with what they do, but like I said, I was proud of the effort that the kids put forward.”
If anything, having lost once to the Bruins gives the Trojans an even better reason to come back and beat them the second time around. 
“I think just putting the ball in the basket honestly [will be the key to Monday’s game],” sophomore guard Minyon Moore said. “I think we did good rotating the ball and I think we just didn’t get good shots up. I think we just need to go to practice tomorrow and Sunday and work on our offense.”
Along with preparing on the court, the team will also need to get their mindset and attitude in check before their game against the Bruins Monday. 
“You know, they got us once, but we come back on Monday,” Moore said.“We just need to stay together, fresh start, 0-0.”
The Trojans will face the Bruins at Galen Center Monday night at 6 p.m.

A lot of football fans are disappointed with the NFL. Between new safety rules, the kneeling protest controversies and the fact that no official in the league seems to know how to rule a catch, fans have a plethora of reasons to stop watching the NFL.
 About a week ago, I heard the news of the return of the XFL, an independent football league that was shut down after its only season in 2001. Understanding how big of a flop the XFL was, I’m definitely skeptical of its return. However, if there were ever a time to introduce and popularize an alternative football league, it would be now.
 Yes, the XFL failed. Yes, the NFL attracts more viewers than presidential debates. Yes, football is the most watched sport in the U.S. and the NFL dominates the football scene. But, there are a lot of pigskin fans who have gone on strike from watching the NFL. What are they going to do, watch the Canadian Football League?
 I was only three years old when the XFL had its inaugural (and final) season, but I remember scrolling through YouTube some years later and seeing clips of players from the league. The style and personality of the league intrigued me. I grew up watching the NFL and the WWE. I loved the high-intensity, athletic achievements I saw from the NFL and adored the personalities and stories behind each of the superstars in the WWE. I couldn’t help but be captivated by the crossover between the two styles. 
 All of the XFL players had personality. Not only did they have the crazy celebrations that fans loved, but the self-chosen nicknames on the backs of their jerseys gave the players an outlet to express that personality. Rod “He Hate Me” Smart was an utter genius. He wasn’t a great football player and there are probably very few people who remember his highlights but he is still talked about today for his personality. 
WWE CEO Vince McMahon is a smart guy. How many people can turn a television series consisting of fixed, fake wrestling matches into a billion-dollar industry? He knows what people want to see. 
In his XFL relaunch announcement, he thoroughly emphasized that the fans will get what they want.
“We’re going to ask a lot of questions and listen to players, coaches,” McMahon said. “We’re going to listen to medical experts, technology experts, members of the media and anyone else who understands and loves the game of football. But most importantly we are going to be listening to the fans.”
Football fans want a voice. Open Twitter during any Sunday during the football season and there is no doubt you will see a slew of tweets criticizing the NFL. The fans want to improve the game they love. Can you blame them? 
The XFL was rushed and chock-full of gimmicks. The “opening scramble,” no fair catches and the “bump and run” rule were just ridiculous. 
McMahon has learned from his failure. His plan to reintroduce the XFL in 2020 will give him plenty of time to recognize and listen to the demands of football fans and iron out the kinks that hindered the original XFL. 
Let’s address the elephant in the room: There is a demographic of football fans who are fed up with politics in sports. Some people want their entertainment to be separate from politics, especially in today’s political environment. For them, sports should be a three-hour vacation from reality. McMahon looks to satisfy that desire with the XFL.
In the midst of the giant failure of the XFL, fans often forget that the league brought many advancements to the game of football. They were not the first league to utilize a sky cam; however, they were the first to popularize its use. Can you imagine watching a football broadcast without an overhead view?
As a journalist, my favorite innovation the XFL brought about is the increase in sideline and halftime interviews. They provide the fans and reporters with insight into the team’s game plan for the second half.
Agree or disagree with McMahon’s plan, the XFL is the perfect storm. Its timing, format and mission are the best way any alternative league could possibly compete with the giant that is the NFL. I am genuinely excited for the technological advancements, rule changes and refreshed format that the XFL will bring to the game of football.

Students from several colleges all over Southern California packed Bovard Auditorium to watch the performance of Wizard of Jade. Photo courtesy of Facebook.
As a part of an annual celebration of Chinese culture, USC Chinese American Student Association put on its 19th culture show Saturday night at Bovard Auditorium.
Along with USC students, many other CASA members from other nearby schools — including UCLA, UCI, UCR and UCSD — showed their support and filled the seats in the audience. Their cheering elucidated the strength of the Chinese American community in Southern California schools. 
During the culture show, CASA performed the play Wizard of Jade, directed by Emily Yamanaka, a sophomore majoring in economics and east Asian languages and cultures, and Byron Li, a junior majoring in computer science. 
The play focused on USC freshman Amy Hsu, portrayed by Cheryl Koh a senior studying business administration, who establishes a goal in college to reject anything related to her Chinese culture. She deliberately tries to hide her Chinese heritage, even changing her name to Emilia, a “less Asian” name. After attending a fraternity party and passing out, Amy wakes up in a completely foreign world, The Land of Jade.
The play followed Amy’s quest to accept herself for who she truly is, and successfully captured the mindset of many teenage Asian Americans who are afraid to embrace their culture.
Within just two hours, Yamanaka and Li cleverly incorporated ancient Chinese mythical tales into the play, transforming old stories into fun new characters that non-Chinese audience members could relate to as well. Ancient tales such as Sun Wukong, Chang’e and the White Snake merged together, as characters from each tale helped Amy during her journey. The directors molded Sun Wukong, also known as the Monkey King, into a character who ran away from his problems, much like Amy in the play. They also merged Chang’e and White Snake into similar situations, ultimately aiding Amy’s realization of the importance of her cultural roots.
For Yamanaka, the hardest part of running the show was coming up with a schedule that worked for everyone. 
“The hardest part was definitely scheduling for rehearsals,” Yamanaka said. “We didn’t have any full run throughs with the complete cast until the actual show. We managed to pull off well enough though so I’m pretty happy with the result.”
It was hard to tell that they had their first run-through during the actual show, as even the transitions between scenes were filled with other kinds of entertainment. In between scenes, Yamanaka and Li invited various Asian American cultural groups on campus to perform. Chaotic 3, USC’s hip-hop dance team that stemmed from CASA decades ago, performed a number that melded perfectly with the play, while the Trogons a capella group performed a mashup of both Mandarin and English songs that captured the sentiments of identity and growth. Trojan Bhangra provided a different cultural experience with their upbeat performance that showcased Punjabi and Indian dance styles. Combined with voice solos from actors, these performances added a refreshing interruption every few scenes to retain the audience’s attention.
Yamanaka hoped that many situations depicted in the play will seem familiar to audience members and that they would be able to relate to her play. 
“Even though I wrote the play so it is very funny, the main plot is about how an Asian American deals with identity crisis and her journey to start incorporating culture into her life,” Yamanaka said.

To be young, gifted and black; oh what a lovely, precious dream.
Nina Simone’s tribute to the late playwright Lorraine Hansberry in the opening stanza of her song “To Be Young, Gifted and Black” has been echoed in the music of acclaimed artists such as Aretha Franklin and Rapsody, but the sentiment itself has had an even broader scope. Black excellence in America is perhaps no more evident than it is in the world of music, shown in the laundry list of names across various genres that dominated their era and molded the sounds that followed it.
However, arguably no single artist embodies the mentality of black pride and joy more than Chicago rapper Common, and his album Be perfectly encapsulates this reputation. Setting aside the actual music, the album cover is striking enough: Common’s warm smile, glowing atop the golden background as he revels in his own happiness with his eyes closed and mind open. Here, his essence serves as the perfect precursor for the sunshine that beams through the speakers soon after you press play on the opening song and title track “Be (Intro),” until Common enters the scene a few moments later to bless your ears with poetic wisdom and encouragement. 
The first time I truly appreciated the album came on a picturesque San Diego afternoon, in the office of my college counselor during my junior year of high school. To start our first meeting of many, Mr. Thompson began by asking a few questions about my background and interests before deciding to enlighten me with Be, soundtracking our conversation about my future with lyrics that preached of hope for black America as a whole. Outside the room was the rigid PWI where few faces looked like mine, but within the walls of Mr. Thompson’s office, the only African American in my class could talk with one of the few on faculty about the road ahead, and what needed to be done to get there.
Art by Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
In more ways than one, I left the room with new inspiration — not only with a renewed vigor to earn acceptance into my dream school USC, but to emulate Common’s philosophy and keep his words in mind as a role model. 
Songs such as “Faithful” would be on repeat during many drives to and from my high school, while “Chi-City” often served as motivation for whatever daunting task was in front of me. Subsequently, I found myself becoming more invested in black issues across the board, taking on a leadership role in my school’s Black Student Union and joining the San Diego Links Achievers Program, aimed to help prepare black seniors for life after high school.
I can’t remember a time in my life when I was ever ashamed to be African American, but while growing up in the suburbs and often being the darkest face in the classroom, there wasn’t much around me that allowed me to feel connected to my ethnic community. 
Common was among the first of many artists to stimulate my interest in the black experience, as I drew heavily from his music as well as his autobiography, One Day It’ll All Make Sense. Still to this day I’m unable to separate the Chicago MC from that pivotal listen-through in Mr. Thompson’s office, only widening the smile that appears on my face every time Be pops up next on my Spotify queue.
So this Black History Month, I’m thrilled to celebrate black excellence once again, through artists who are pushing the culture forward and sharing their keys to success in the process. Following a year where I witnessed Solange embody the feeling of empowerment while performing “F.U.B.U” at FYF Fest and heard Jay-Z enlighten me once again on his 13th album 4:44, I’m as proud as ever to walk down Trousdale Parkway every day and strive to make the same impact that my heroes have already made on me. 
And, speaking of black excellence…
Why I’m Smiling: The Tracklist for the Black Panther Soundtrack
I’m pretty sure TDE has somehow made an appearance in every edition of “To Pen a Butterfly” so far. Their artists are littered all over the tracklist for the upcoming Black Panther movie, the soundtrack to which drops this Friday, Feb. 9. Typically, movie soundtracks can be a hit or a miss without the accompanying visuals, but with Kendrick Lamar serving as executive producer and three impressive singles released so far, Black Panther: The Album is shaping up as one that won’t disappoint.
Why I’m Shaking My Head: Recording Academy President Neil Portnow Says Women Need to “Step Up”
How quickly the tide turns. It already feels like ages ago that intrigue for the 2018 GRAMMYs was as high as ever thanks to the relatively diverse slate of nominees, as the show’s aftermath has been much of the same, tired frustrations directed at the Recording Academy. After Alessia Cara was the only woman to win a major award (17 of 86 possible awards went to women), President Neil Portnow only stoked the flames with his claim that women need to “step up” if they want better representation and recognition. If the backlash that came in an open letter from several female executives is any indication, the numerous women already sharing their art with the world aren’t the problem: Rather, it’s typical GRAMMY close-mindedness.
Why I’m Hopeful for the Future: The Never Had Sh!t tour featuring J.I.D, EARTHGANG and Chaz French
The city of Atlanta has another young star on the rise. J.I.D’s The Never Story was among hip-hop’s brightest debut albums in 2017, with his swarming, off-kilter flow creating an instant earworm. This Saturday his cross country tour with EARTHGANG and Chaz French will be stopping at the Roxy Theatre in Hollywood, and the energy is sure to be through the roof the entire night. J.I.D and EARTHGANG both impressed when opening up for Joey Bada$$  at the Echoplex this past summer, and now, with their increased notoriety, the Spillage Village artists certainly have another outstanding performance up their sleeve. If you consider yourself a hip-hop fan, it’s set to be a concert you won’t want to miss.

Cece Uhrich, a junior majoring in environmental science and health, recalls feeling “defective” when she was trying to understand her sexuality. She said that the “heteronormativity of society” led her to feel depressed in middle and high school.

“I couldn’t relate to my friends, and I felt stupid for being the only one who had never kissed a boy,” Uhrich said. “It definitely affected my self-esteem so much growing up, not that I really understood why. I can’t imagine that that was good for me, to not understand my sexuality and not realize that was even an option to not like boys and still be a normal human being.”
Now at USC, she wrote a paper speaking about her experience as a gay woman, but noticed that much of the research she did was solely based on theory — not statistics and hard facts.
USC’s LGBT Health Equity Initiative wants to change that.
The  initiative is a collaboration among faculty, Ph.D. students and undergraduate research assistants studying different aspects of the mental health of LGBT individuals. The research focuses primarily on gender minority and sexual minority individuals.
“The goal [of the initiative] is to improve knowledge so that we can intervene to improve the lives of LGBTQ people across contexts, across age groups, across racial and ethnic boundaries,” said Cary Klemmer, a Ph.D. student working on the initiative. “So that we can understand also the interplay of different factors, like race and ethnicity, on the experiences of LGBTQ people.”
USC Dworak-Peck assistant professor Jeremy Goldbach, the director of the initiative, said that this program is one of few focused on mental health research. 
Goldbach said that past funding for research in LGBTQ communities has primarily focused on HIV, as it was an epidemic that needed immediate attention. However, that research was geared toward men, leaving major gaps in knowledge, she said.
“This has left us with a lot of research that’s focused on men, young men and primarily white young men,” Goldbach said. “So that means that we have a whole community out there that we don’t know much about.”
Jeremy Gibbs, a Ph.D. candidate working on the initiative, said that their ability to conduct more comprehensive research has been made possible due to a change in the “social conscience” of the United States.
“Same-sex marriage is allowed now, [and] there are a number of laws that now protect individuals who are sexual minorities or gender minorities,” Gibbs said. “And so there’s been a considerable change over the last five or six years.”
One of these changes includes the repeal of the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, which banned openly gay, lesbian and bisexual individuals from serving in the military. 
Now, the Health Equity Initiative is conducting the Military Acceptance Project. With funding provided by the Department of Defense, the two-phase project is looking at the behavioral health needs of active duty LGBT service members by conducting both qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys. The data gathered will be used to recommend improvements to the Department of Defense for the health of LGBT service members.
The initiative is currently working on six other projects as well, including research to understand and reduce suicide risk among sexual minority adolescents and substance abuse among 18- to 24-year-old sexual minority men. It is also running a longitudinal study in collaboration with the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles to determine how minority stress may influence health from adolescence into young adulthood. 
While Uhrich supports this research and looks forward to information coming from it, she hopes that the research will be presented to the public in a way that is understandable for the LGBTQ youth.
“If they can do that, this will have a huge impact,” Uhrich said. “If you could read something and realize that you’re not alone and you’re not defective for having these experiences … one of the biggest things about accepting your sexuality is not feeling alone and feeling normal, which is something this [initiative] could offer people.”

The Creating Reality Hackathon will host 400 participants from March 12 to 15 who will work in teams. Image from Creating Reality Hackathon Website.
The Creating Reality Hackathon at USC from March 12 to 15 will have the attendees work in interdisciplinary teams to create augmented reality and virtual reality applications. The hackathon is held in collaboration with the USC School of Cinematic Arts, the Iovine and Young Academy and USC Viterbi School of Engineering GamePipe Laboratory. 
During the hackathon, 400 participants selected from over 2,000 applicants will compete for cash awards and other prizes. Each team will consist of developers, designers and artists. The judges evaluate each team product based on what they deem how impactful and important. 
According to an UploadVR article, “this community’s core purpose is to learn and to deepen our understanding of how immersive technologies can be applied.” 
Although USC has hosted other hackathons in the past, this is the first year a hackathon will  feature virtual reality technology. The hackathon was initially started by the Grassroots Developer Education from the Reality Virtually Hackathon at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Media Lab, but was adapted for USC and the Los Angeles community. 
The USC GamePipe Laboratory, one of the groups sponsoring event, is led by the program’s founding director and Viterbi professor Mike Zyda. He also started the Joint Advanced Games programs which collaborates with the Iovine and Young Academy. 
“[Hackathons] let people take a break from school a little bit and to build something quickly that someday might appear in class,” Zyda said. 
Zyda emphasized how hackathons can serve as building blocks for future ideas and companies. The first day of the hackathon will host workshops; the following two days will be dedicated to building the augmented reality and virtual reality technology; and the final day will include judging the project submissions.

USC chemistry professor Jahan Dawlaty, University of Houston professor Yan Yao and SUNY Binghampton University professor Puja Goyal, received a $100,000 Scialog Award from Research Corporation for Science Advancement to explore the behavior of protons. 
They have proposed a safer battery model that relies on both non-flammable and aqueous electrolytes using an acid-based electrolyte and a plant-based anode.
Improving the safety of batteries is a necessary part of the global development of renewable energy and electric-powered transportation, according to the RCSA. 
The most common batteries used today depend on flammable, non-aqueous electrolytes, according to a press release from the RCSA. 
Additionally, Brent Melot, USC assistant professor in the department of chemistry, and Louis Piper, a professor at Binghampton University, received the same award to improve battery performance and study redox activity, the process through which molecules gain or lose electrons, or anions.
RCSA is a private institution that helps fund research in the physical sciences independently proposed by professors at U.S. universities and colleges. The Scialog Award is specialized to support research and building dialogue in the science community.
“Ultimately, Scialog aims to advance human knowledge by empowering a national community of early career scientists with many promising years of research ahead of them,” the RCSA website says. “Through the give-and-take of community building, it is the Foundation’s hope that Scialog Fellows grow better equipped to tackle ever more challenging multidisciplinary problems.”
RCSA Senior Program Director Richard Wiener said that funding high-risk research may not always produce worthy results, but when it does, it benefits the scientific and general community greatly.
“Scialog is an experiment in accelerating the pace of breakthrough scientific discoveries,” Wiener said in a press release about Piper and Melot’s award. “Creative researchers like Yao, Dawlaty and Goyal represent the world’s best hope for a brighter tomorrow. RCSA is proud to support them.”
