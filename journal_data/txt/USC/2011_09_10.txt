It came down to the fourth quarter.
Again.
This time, and for the second consecutive game this season, the USC defense came up with a stop when it mattered most.

After an overturned call gave Utah a first down and a pass interference call moved the Utes into field goal range, Utah brought out the kicking unit to force the game into overtime. Utah kicker Coleman Peterson’s 41-yard attempt was blocked, however, by junior offensive tackle Matt Kalil’s and returned for a touchdown by redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris, giving USC a 23-14 win in its Pac-12 opener at the Coliseum.
“I’m excited that it finished this way,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “Wins like this can be really special. I’m actually glad the way it happened at the end and I’m proud of our players.”
USC’s defense — a concern coming into the season — held Utah to just 81 yards rushing. USC’s running game, which was almost non-existent last weekend, appeared re-energized with the play and return of senior running back Marc Tyler.
“Having a big back like him that can carry the ball all game like he can really helps us,” junior quarterback Matt Barkley said. “He runs the ball really hard … He’s a good back for us and I’m glad he’s back.”
Reinstated last week, Tyler had 24 carries for 117 yards and one touchdown.

“This is something that I dreamed about doing,” Tyler said. “To come back and [make] an impact to the team. I feel like I owed the team, the fans and the coaches.”
Last weekend, USC elected to call a pass plays more than 45 times of its 73 offensive possessions. Tonight, the Trojans ran the ball 39 times and attempted 32 passes. Kiffin often elected to rely on the senior Tyler against a strong, experienced Utah front-seven Saturday.
“I kind of thought it would be that type of game,” Kiffin said. “I thought it would probably be a Marc Tyler type of game, and especially with [redshirt freshman] D.J. Morgan putting the ball on the ground, it made it an easy choice to increase Marc’s carries.”
Tyler’s six-yard run with two minutes remaining in the first quarter gave USC a 10-0 lead, but like last weekend, Utah did just enough to hang around. Or rather, USC allowed the Utes to keep it within striking distance.
A Barkley interception at the Utah 21-yard line did not hurt the Trojans but Morgan’s fumble inside the red zone with just under seven minutes proved costly.
Junior quarterback Jordan Wynn led the Utes on a 12-play, 84-yard scoring drive, connecting with junior wide receiver DeVonte Christopher on a 10-yard pass to cut the USC lead to 10-7 heading into halftime.
The USC defense limited Utah to just 152 yards of total offense in the first half, but 84 of those yards came on Utah’s four-minute scoring drive.
Despite finishing scoreless in the second half of last weekend’s season opener, USC responded right away on its first possession of the second half against the Utes. Barkley orchestrated a seven-play, 88-yard drive, finding freshman tight end Xavier Grimble for a 9-yard strike to extend the USC lead to 17-7.
As had been the case in the first half, however, USC would turn the ball over again on its next possession. This time, Grimble fumbled the ball, giving Utah field position at the USC 48-yard line with another chance to capitalize and cut into the lead.
Two plays later, the Utes cut into the Trojans lead on junior John White IV’s one-yard touchdown run.
As in last week’s season opener against Minnesota, the USC offense appeared to fall out of rhythm in the second half, only scoring one touchdown and leaving the door open for Utah to take advantage.
The defense, however, held strong. Two sacks — one by redshirt linebacker Hayes Pullard and one by junior defensive end Nick Perry — halted Utah offensive drives on third-down plays in the fourth quarter.
“We got a really good effort from our defense,” Kiffin said. “There are so many questions about this team’s ability to finish. For us to go out there and keep stopping them really gives us something to build on.”
Pac-12 and USC officials changed the score from 17-14 to 23-14 more than two hours after the end of the game, ruling Harris’s touchdown to be allowable after it was initially negated by an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on the USC sideline.

Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott said Saturday that the conference was not actively looking to expand despite rumors suggesting it could be looking to add the University of Oklahoma, among others, in the coming weeks.
“We’re not looking to initiate talks about conference expansion,” Scott said before the inaugural Pac-12 game between USC and Utah. “But we’ll look at our options and reconsider.”
Scott did confirm that several schools had reached out to him to inquire about the possibility of joining the Pac-12. He declined, however, to comment about individual schools.
“We had a plan for 16 last year and we think it could work well,” Scott said. “But that was last year.”
Talks of expansion surfaced in recent weeks, as several Big XII schools expressed an interest in leaving the conference, notably Texas A&M, which announced Wednesday it was leaving for the SEC before a potential lawsuit from Baylor delayed such plans.
“We don’t plan to expand,” Scott said. “What’s changed is what’s going on with the Bix XII.”

How will Utah adjust to its new conference?
Like Colorado, Utah joined the Pac-10 on July 1, 2011, to form the Pac-12 . The Utes, formerly from the Mountain West conference, will take part in the first ever Pac-12 football game when they visit Los Angeles on Saturday. It remains to be seen, though, how well Utah will adjust to playing in a BCS conference. History suggests the transition won’t be too difficult. Dating back to 2003, the Utes boast an impressive 80-22 record, including a 7-3 mark against Pac-10 teams. 
Will Lane Kiffin throw down the field?
In the opener against Minnesota, bubble screens and short pass attempts characterized USC’s aerial attack. Of junior quarterback Matt Barkley’s 45 pass attempts, 36 of them netted ten yards or less. Furthermore, nine of Robert Woods’ seventeen catches came on one-step drops by Barkley. The Golden Gopher defense adjusted, and as a result, the USC offense was shut down.
How many players will Lane Kiffin use?
Before the season kicked off, Kiffin stated he would rotate players heavily. However, the Trojans used very few players in the win against Minnesota. Overall, 43 saw action, with 19 of those on the defensive side of the ball. Late in the season, depth could become an issue if the starters’ minutes pile up.
Can Robert Woods win the Heisman?
The sophomore sensation, who earned Freshman All-America honors last year, broke the school record for most catches in a single game with 17 in the opener. He managed to amass 177 yards and 3 touchdowns in his historic performance. If Woods can have another big game against a Utah secondary that had one combined start coming in to the season, he is sure to move in to the spotlight early on. After Saturdays win, several reporters asked Woods about the attention he might receive nationally. He responded, “It doesn’t matter to me. I’m just going to go home, turn on film and get ready to play Utah.”
Will Utah’s defensive line dominate USC’s offensive line?
All week, Lane Kiffin has raved about the talent Utah possesses on their defensive line. He declared them the best he has seen since returning to USC, and that will prove to be a tremendous challenge. USC’s offensive line is still trying to become a cohesive unit, and it will not be easy to establish the run and protect Barkley against the Utes’ talented corps.
