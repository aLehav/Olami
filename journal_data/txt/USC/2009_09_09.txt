The USC women’s soccer team fell victim to a late penalty kick goal Sunday, losing 1-0 to Ohio State in San Diego and spoiling a weekend that saw the Women of Troy capture their first victory of the season.
The match was scoreless deep into the second half until Ohio State forward freshman Lauren Granberg found herself on a breakaway against USC goalkeeper Kristin Olsen. The USC senior dove for the ball, but Granberg touched it wide of Olsen and then fell down in the box. The referee pointed to the penalty spot and sent Olsen off with a red card.

“I ended up missing her and the ball,” Olsen said. “The ref thought I had tripped her. I was kind of surprised because I didn’t even touch her.”
Redshirt senior Brittany Massro came on to play goalie, but she was unable to stop Buckeye defender junior Cassie Dickerson’s penalty kick goal. The Women of Troy (1-0), forced to play with only 10 players for the rest of the match, couldn’t find the equalizer.
Ohio State led USC in shots on goal, 11 to eight , but the Women of Troy did have some good opportunities to score. USC freshman forward Samantha Johnson was a constant threat to the Buckeye defense, putting one shot high and another wide of the goal, while redshirt senior Marihelen Tomer and sophomore midfielder Alyssa Dávila forced the Ohio State goalkeeper to make two saves in quick succession in the second half.
“We definitely had some chances to win the game,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “Sam Johnson had a look, Marihelen had a look. We just need to keep our composure in front of the goal.”
The loss against Ohio State came in USC’s second game of the USD Nike Classic, a mini-tournament hosted by the University of San Diego.
On Friday, four USC players scored en route to a 4-0 victory over Cal State Fullerton. Johnson was the star of the show, registering a goal and two assists on the evening.
Freshman midfielder Courtney Garcia gave the Women of Troy the lead less than three minutes into the game when she took a pass from Johnson and fired it off the far post and in for her first collegiate goal.
Junior midfielder Megan Ohai doubled the lead in the 12th minute when she got on to the end of a long pass from junior midfielder-turned-defender Ashli Sandoval and put it past the goalkeeper.
Johnson added her first goal for USC in the 19th minute, taking the ball at the top of the box, maneuvering around defenders and shooting it into the far low corner.
Dávila completed the scoring in the 28th, taking Johnson’s deflected cross and turning it into goal.
“We kinda knew that we had to win and we were tired of losing,” Johnson said. “We played with a lot more confidence and composure on the field.”
The weekend of mixed results left Khosroshahin pointing to his team’s improvement but also noting that USC will have to improve its ball possession and finishing in the coming weeks.
“I definitely see improvement every time they step on the field,” Khosroshahin added. “But improvement just isn’t good enough sometimes. You just have to get the job done and we’re hoping that part will come sooner than later.”

With the Trojans set to face Ohio State in 105,000-seat Ohio Stadium this Saturday, there’s one thing on their minds.
Not dual-threat quarterback Terrelle Pryor. Not lightning-bolt tailback Dan Herron.
It’ll be the noise level in the Horseshoe.
Volume control · The Trojans brought simulated crowd noise in practice to prepare Barkley (7) and the offense for the adverse conditions. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
“The difference in this game is really the noise,” coach Pete Carroll said at his Tuesday press conference. “It’s the noise that is the factor, and we have to deal with that really well.”
To help do so, USC brought in speakers to Howard Jones Field at practice Tuesday and really turned up the noise. Multiple players said the noise was effective.
“These speakers are great,” said true freshman quarterback Matt Barkley. “I could barely hear myself shouting during the scrimmage.
“I think that’s the only factor that will get to us, the sound.”
Carroll also noted that one of USC’s most famous games — the 2005 Notre Dame that featured the Bush Push — took place in a high-volume situation, and Matt Leinart still managed to checkdown to receiver Dwayne Jarrett on a “critical” fourth-and-nine situation.

Junior center Kristofer O’Dowd missed the San Jose State contest with a dislocated right kneecap, but he suited up for scout team action in practice Tuesday and said he plans to play Saturday.
“Mentally, I’m ready to go,” O’Dowd said after practice Tuesday. “Physically, I’m getting there. Every day it’s getting better. I had a lot of reps today. By the end of the week I’ll be out there and hopefully in the starting lineup.”
O’Dowd was named to the preseason Rimington Award Watch List after a standout sophomore season, but he’s been injury-prone thus far in his career. He injured the same kneecap during his freshman season and underwent shoulder surgery this spring.
“He’s doing fine,” Carroll said. “We’ll wait and see how the film looks, but he’s got a couple more days. So far, he’s doing well.”
O’Dowd was officially medically cleared after practice.

On the defensive back front, redshirt senior cornerback Kevin Thomas missed practice with flu-like symptoms, leading Carroll to start developing a contingency plan in case a corner is needed to start across from Josh Pinkard against the Buckeyes.
Either redshirt freshman Brian Baucham or sophomore T.J. Bryant, both second-year defensive backs, could be the choice, but Baucham missed the San Jose State game due to illness.
Said Carroll: “We gotta wait to see how Baucham does, because he was right there sitting in the third spot before [he was injured] last week.”

Barkley turned 19 Tuesday. What did he do?
“I had tutoring and class and I watched some film,” Barkley said. “Just a normal Tuesday, nothing special.”

In early season games, teams are supposed to try to shake off the rust from the offseason, work the kinks out of their systems and sometimes struggle.
Someone forgot to tell that to the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team as it opened its season by capturing the championship at this weekend’s Triton Invitational.

Following convincing wins over Pomona-Pitzer, Air Force and Loyola Marymount, the No. 1 Trojans (4-0) completed their run through the weekend tournament by defeating UC Santa Barbara by a margin of 16-5.
As the only teams in the eight-team event to finish with an unblemished record after group play had been completed, anticipation built throughout the day for the matchup of the two teams.
When the two teams finally did meet, USC got out to a fast start, much as they had in its other three matches of the weekend, scoring three quick goals, finishing the first quarter leading 5-2.
The second quarter did not see quite as much offense, but the Trojan defense continued to step up and did not suffer when sophomore driver Peter Kurzeka was able to score the only point.
Defense was a strong point for the Trojans all weekend. Led by a group of goalies ­­— sophomore Joel Dennerley (the starter), and backups in senior Brett Giery, and redshirt freshman Will Simon — the defense combined to allow just 18 goals in four games during the tournament. For a team that led the nation in defense last season, knowing they hadn’t lost its defensive touch was important, especially for 15-year coach Jovan Vavic.
“We always focus on defense, we know how important it is,” Vavic said. “It’s our trademark.”
When the second half finally came around, it was the offense’s time to shine.
In total, 14 different Trojans scored in the final game, highlighted by the third quarter in which six different players scored six goals. This gave Vavic a good feeling going forward into the still-young season.
“Usually, at the beginning of the season, there’s a tendency to miss a lot, but our guys did a good job,” Vavic said. “We are difficult to defend.”
The Trojans were able to coast to the championship in the fourth quarter, allowing just one more goal while posting three more on offense to complete the championship game and extending their winning streak to 33 the nation’s longest.
Getting to the championship game seemed a foregone conclusion for the Trojans after the first day of the Triton Invitational, after the team scored a combined 32 goals in the first two games against Pomona-Pitzer and Air Force.
But on the second day, LMU stood between the Trojans and their eventual date with the UCSB Gauchos. LMU — who during last year’s Triton Invitational took the Trojans to a sudden-death overtime which Vavic and the team blame on a lack of recognition of the importance of the tournament — proved a tough test for the Trojans during their mid-morning meeting.
After falling behind early in the first quarter, the Trojans were able to find the equalizer from Kurzeka and then pulled ahead after a score from redshirt junior driver Kyle Sterling.
In earlier games, once the Trojans had pulled ahead they had not looked back and coasted to easy victories, but the Lions were not willing to go so quietly. The found an equalizer of their own on a five-meter penalty shot.
Finally toward the end of the second quarter, the Trojans were able to pull slightly ahead after a four-goal run. A goal from LMU just before the end of the half put a damper on the run by the Trojans, but USC came out with just as much fire as they started the game with.
Senior driver Matt Sagehorn took over and finished with a hat trick, leading the Trojans to an 11-6 final score in their final game of group play.
After the end of the Triton Invitational, Vavic, the reigning national men’s coach of the year, was reassured by where his team was after just four games in two short days.
“This early in the season, we’re in really good shape,” Vavic said.

The official San Jose State football website sported this headline postgame Saturday and for much of Sunday: “Spartans Score First; USC Wins, 56-3.”
Really? Talk about a misleading headline.
Your opponent scored eight straight touchdowns and you point out your measly field goal?
Bold choice.
Apart from that ridiculousness, there are a few things USC can take away from last Saturday’s beatdown and what they could mean for this Saturday’s showdown.
Three, actually.
One for each point SJSU scored.
1. Did you see the Trojan linebackers?
The USC defense is not going to have trouble against Terrelle Pryor.
Redshirt junior Michael Morgan, redshirt sophomore Chris Galippo and junior Malcolm Smith — with one career start between them — absolutely roamed the field. Save a 25-yard run by Spartan running back redshirt senior Patrick Perry in the first quarter, Galippo and Co. were not giving up anything.
Counting sacks, San Jose State averaged 0.3 yards per carry.
Pryor has electrifying speed and all, but so do Morgan and Smith. In fact, I’d bet that Morgan is faster than Pryor.
Morgan ran a 4.47 last year, by the way.
So you’re telling me that Pryor — who rushed for one first down and fumbled near his own end zone against a Navy defense that doesn’t boast nearly the same type of athletes as USC does — is really going to challenge the Trojan linebackers?
I don’t see it.
2. What might be a problem, though, is the leash Pete Carroll has on Matt Barkley.
No, really: Count how many times Barkley threw a pass Saturday that you would rate above a five on a one-to-10 degree-of-difficulty scale.
I’m not saying Barkley didn’t do his job — in fact, I don’t think he could have done much better with what he was given. I’m saying that he wasn’t given a chance to do much at all.
And to that I ask, why not?
The game was a blowout. The outcome was certain by halftime. Why not have Barkley air it out in the third quarter?
On USC’s first series of the second half, Barkley did come up throwing.
Two checkdowns to redshirt junior Stanley Havili, two admittedly nice passes that senior Anthony McCoy and junior Joe McKnight turned into big gainers and a couple solid reads that resulted in a touchdown.
He threw just twice more the rest of the day.
For a true freshman who turned 19 yesterday, I would think he needed a bit more experience to be truly ready for Ohio State.
During Barkley’s most successful series Saturday, there were roughly 60,000 people left at the Coliseum and the decibel level was entirely reasonable.
For the first snap this Saturday, there will be roughly 105,000 fans — many of them hostile — crowding the Horseshoe for the stadium’s ninth night game in its history.
If you watch Monday Night Football, you know things are just little crazier in football stadiums at night.
You can look at it two ways: Either USC coach Pete Carroll saw enough from Barkley in practice and in 19 game-situation throws to be confident in his ability to handle the pressure in Columbus, or this could get ugly.
The only defense of Ohio State’s caliber that Barkley has faced in his life has been USC’s own — and, by the time he was named the starter at quarterback, he’d seen just about every coverage scheme they had to offer.
Still, no matter how much film he watches, the Buckeyes will throw things at him he’s not expecting.
I trust Barkley — who has the arm and mind to make just about every throw imaginable — to step it up against a superior opponent. Does Carroll?
3. Still, if I’m Carroll, what I’m most nervous for on Saturday is special teams play.
Take a look at Monday’s Florida State­­—Miami game for an example of a kicker costing a team a game: The Seminoles’ Dustin Hopkins, a freshman, missed an extra point in the third quarter that ended up being pretty crucial to Miami’s 38-34 victory.
For USC, the only real minus against San Jose State was the punting of Billy O’Malley. O’Malley averaged only 34.7 yards per punt and absolutely shanked a 24-yarder in the first quarter that directly led to San Jose State’s only three points.
Ohio State’s Ray Small ranked in the nation’s top 10 in punt return average last season.
Unless O’Malley shows a stronger leg this week in practice, I’m having junior Jake Harfman do the punting Saturday. Harfman, a kicker/punter in high school and junior college, has been relegated to kickoff duties so far because of a lengthy release. Still, he averaged 68 yards on his kickoffs against San Jose State. The Trojans can’t afford to throw away what could easily be five to 10 yards on every punt.
As a USC fan, I do trust Carroll to do all in his power to make the necessary adjustments for the Buckeyes. Two of them: Let Barkley go a little bit, and let Harfman punt.

The No. 15 USC women’s volleyball team continued their recent string of sweeps Tueday night agianst No. 20 UC Irvine (25-16, 25-19, 25-20) at the Galen Center.
UC Irvine (6-0) came into the match with a perfect record and a potential advantage in coach Paula Weishoff, a former USC women’s volleyball champion in 1980 (her jersey number hangs in the risers of the Galen Center) and an assistant for USC coach Mick Haley, Despite whatever inside knowlege Weishoff provided about USC, the Women of Troy would not be denied.

“I really think we’re getting better,” Haley said. “It’s hard with a middle of the week game when they’re studying, but that’s the same with both teams. I really think if we can keep our focus … [and] get a better execution — those are the things I want to work on.”
The Women of Troy came out strong, starting with senior All-American outside hitter Jessica Gysin’s first kill of the game, but a couple team errors caused the Anteaters to take a one point lead, 6-7.
Gysin, with the help of sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter, managed to pick the game back up with a combined six kills to get back their substantial lead. They ended up winning the first set with their lead, 25-16.
The Anteater offense got the best of USC in the next set, but after a botched serve from UCI and a couple kills from Gysin, they tied the game 10-10, and USC used that adrenaline to snag a few kills from Jupiter, Garret and sophomore middle blocker Lauren Williams with two sharp kills, making the winning score 25-19.
In the third set, junior defensive specialist Geena Urango and sophomore Lauren Williams stepped back into the game. Play from was even from both teams a kill and a few digs from Urango sparked a 3-0 run to give the Women of Troy  the 13-10 advantage, which gave them enough momentum to win the set 25-20.
The Women of Troy are set to play three matches away from home this weekend in a tournament held in Orem, Utah. USC will face Idaho State on Friday at 1 p.m. and Utah Valley — the host of the tournament — at 7 p.m. USC will play Utah Valley again on Saturday, at 1 p.m.

After a first quarter that was marred by offensive mistakes, Matt Barkley is still smiling.
The disappointment of two fumbles by his teammates is not weighing on his shoulders. The challenge of being the first true freshman quarterback to start a season opener for a top-five team also seems distant.
Instead, Barkley is living in the moment.
Cool kid · Matt Barkley (7) celebrates with Joe McKnight (4) and Damian Williams (18) Saturday at the Coliseum. The true freshman had a stellar outing in his first-ever start, throwing for 233 yards and one score. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
“On one of our first drives in the second quarter, he walks out and says to me, ‘Isn’t this fun?’” said redshirt junior wide receiver Damian Williams. “I looked back at him and said, ‘Yeah, for you it should be a lot of fun.’”
Saturday’s game became a lot more fun for Barkley after his conversation with Williams. Barkley and the rest of the Trojan offense overcame a sluggish start to score eight unanswered touchdowns to route San Jose State, 56-3, at the Coliseum.
In his much-anticipated debut, Barkley proved up to the task of guiding the Trojans’ offense, completing 15 of 19 passes for 233 yards and a touchdown.
The Trojans emphasized short passes and a sturdy running game to take the pressure off Barkley in his first game. But Barkley’s accomplishments weren’t lost on USC coach Pete Carroll.
“Call him an outlier or whatever, but this kid isn’t normal,” Carroll said. “But who wants to be normal anyway?”
Part of what put Barkley in the position to be the first true freshman ever to start an opener for USC was his confidence in himself. That poise was needed early when the Trojans’ first five drives went awry and USC found itself down 3-0 at the end of the first quarter.
“Things can get whacked out when you don’t get off to a good start, but it wasn’t a big deal to him at all,” Carroll said.
Barkley’s composure helped lead the Trojans to touchdowns on their next six drives, although the team leaned heavily on the running game. In all, 342 of USC’s 620 yards came on the ground.
One of the many luxuries that the 19-year-old quarterback has been afforded is a running back rotation that is long on experience and talent.
Junior Joe McKnight shouldered the load early and perhaps provided the game’s highlight with a weaving 54-yard jaunt that culminated with a flip into the end zone. But senior Stafon Johnson’s two short touchdown runs and redshirt junior Allen Bradford’s 43-yard scamper into the end zone also helped take the focus off the man behind center.
The offense’s performance in the final three quarters helped reaffirm that Barkley doesn’t need to be the offense’s lone catalyst. Williams, who finished with three catches and 67 yards, and senior tight end Anthony McCoy were two of Barkley’s most frequent targets, often on short routes that minimized risk.
“I think this is the ideal situation for any quarterback,” Williams said. “For Matt, I think it helps his comfort level tremendously. He’s so poised that he just feels comfortable out there. I think that’s because he knows he has a veteran group around him.”
Barkley also found small triumphs in showing his patience. Learning to avoid forced throws and turnovers has been one of the hardest parts of the learning curve for him, but his performance Saturday displayed a shift in his mentality.
“It was a little weird to make that first throw away, but I would have rather had that than a pick,” Barkley said.
Said Carroll: “He almost could have been perfect.”
Although Barkley has had to learn to adapt to the offense, the unit also appears to be taking on some of the characteristics of its new leader. The emotionally charged Mark Sanchez often ran hot and cold last year, as the fiery signal-caller was often seen running down field after big plays and jumping into the air in celebration after touchdowns.
But save for a few moments on Saturday, Barkley was quiet and composed.
The level-headed Barkley was well aware of his leadership style, as well as its advantages and drawbacks.
“I think it might go both ways. I don’t really get nervous,” said Barkley, brushing aside questions of first-game jitters. “But at the same time, I don’t get super pumped up and run downfield pumping my fists. That’s just not me.”
In all, Carroll said he couldn’t expect more from his quarterback in his first test at the Coliseum.

Forget Tarantino and his Basterds — the real ruthless Nazi killers of World War II can be found in the Danish import Flame & Citron.
Based on the actual story of two Danish resistance fighters in Nazi-occupied Denmark who come to be known as Flame and Citron, the film chronicles the efforts and accomplishments in their mission to brutally gun down Nazi officers as well as anyone else thought to be working with the Germans.
War and peace · Danish director Ole Christian Madsen’s award-winning film, Flame & Citron, centers on two resistance fighters — nicknamed Flame (Thure Lindhardt) and Citron (Mads Mikkelsen) — working for the Holger Danske during World War II. Flame & Citron is based on actual events and eyewitness accounts of acts committed by the Holger Danske, a resistance group that started in Denmark in 1942, and was responsible for numerous sabatoges and murders of Nazi soldiers. Though Flame & Citron opened in Denmark in spring 2008, the film just made its way to the US and is now playing at the Laemmle Music Hall, Beverly Hills. - Photos courtesy of IFC Films
The film opens with this startling depiction as the pair effortlessly shoots a Nazi in the middle of a crowded street and, as the film progresses, the killings become more frequent, ultimately affecting the two central characters with forever-damaging consequences.
Directed and co-written by Ole Christian Madsen, the film features a cast mostly unkown to American audiences, with the only exception being the film’s two lead actors, who have both had small roles in recent major Hollywood films.
Mads Mikkelsen — who portrays Citron — is best known in America as well as in Great Britain as the villain in the James Bond film Casino Royale, but he has also appeared in numerous Danish films over the last few years. With each of these films, his ability has improved considerably, and it is in Flame & Citron that he finally becomes unstoppable.
Citron’s partner, the ever-coldhearted Flame, also carries the same weight. Played by Thure Lindhardt, who recently appeared in Angels and Demons as well as Into the Wild, matches Mikkelsen’s intensity and makes watching the two of them act together on-screen a sheer joy.
A great example is a small scene — one that lasts merely 10 seconds — in which the two are shown sitting together in a bar after another successful killing and there is not a word spoken between them. All they do is smoke a cigarette and eventually sit back in their chairs, yet the style and appropriate emphasis on what is not being said make the scene astonishingly powerful.
These two characters are men who are plagued with so much anxiety that they continue to endure and accept, especially as they come to the realization of how out of hand their actions become as the film progresses. Their lives are completely altered by their continual violence, so much so that they ultimately epitomize the very evil they are trying to stop.
What truly makes Flame & Citron a terrific film is that it is not really a war film. It is set during the war, but the true message of the film touches on so much more than military affairs and strategies. With every new Nazi victim, Flame & Citron become just as ruthless as the Nazis, and, by the end of it all, there is really no difference between the supposed good guys and the very evil bad guys.
That is what really legitimizes Flame & Citron as a far superior film to Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds. Both films share similar plot lines, but not perspectives. Tarantino portrays cruelty towards Nazis as a deserving attribute, when really it is a horrible ideology.
Flame & Citron plays with the rationality of good discovering that it is becoming evil, and because of this the film excels.
There is a fantastic line, spoken by the leader of the Gestapo as he is involved in a gunfight with Flame, in which he states: “We are the same. You love Denmark and I love Denmark.” This line, among many others, solidifies the accountability that must be shared by good and evil. Both are endearingly capable of horrific extremes, and this idealogy is displayed quite vividly in the film.
The pragmatic horror of not being able to distinguish right from wrong takes center stage, and each character, whether a Nazi or a resistance fighter, feels the effect. By highlighting the shady gray area between what is right and what is wrong,  Flame & Citron stands out among recent World War II films — including Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds.
The combination of this effect — as well as a brilliant cast and a production crew that does not hold anything back — makes Flame & Citron a film not to be missed.

Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve wanted to fall in love.
But more than that — more than the simple act of stumbling into bliss — I wanted to fall in love through a kiss. A peck on the lips, something sloshy — I was even okay with the idea of braces. I just knew, instinctively and wholeheartedly, that my first kiss was going to be magical. And how could I think otherwise? From almost every story told to me at bedtime, from almost every annual holiday I could imagine, a kiss was something that transcended a tangible connection. It was, to put it simply, something overwhelmingly powerful. Kissing a frog catalyzed his metamorphosis into a prince; kissing a boo-boo was the fastest painkiller; and a kiss at the stroke of midnight on New Year’s Eve was enough to grant an entire 365 days’ worth of good luck. Mistletoe? Sleeping Beauty? Dementors? You may kiss the bride? Michael Corleone’s kiss of death in The Godfather: Part II?
I was convinced. Weren’t you? I was sure that in whatever capacity — whether it was promising your heart or stealing your soul — a kiss was an everyday, yet otherworldly phenomenon. Especially that first kiss with someone brave or someone new or someone seemingly wonderful. Clearly, it was not mundane — it was much more than a handshake, a salute or even an interpretative dance. But despite the many ways in which it appeared supernatural, it always seemed easy. Simple. Lips touched, sparks flew. It would be like two puzzle pieces fitting together, snug and comforting.
Is it any surprise that I was wrong? My first kiss was a bit of a mess. It was hesitant and clumsy. It was filled with doubt and worry but, despite the discomfort and awkward parting, it was with someone I truly, deeply cared about.
It’s interesting when I look back and see how I met the people most important to me. Rare was the encounter when I knew friendship was inevitable — most of the time, it was awkward hellos all around. One of my best friends who I met in middle school initially labeled me a ditz. One person I now consider a kindred spirit stole my crayons in the third grade, justifying a disgruntled vendetta that I held against him for three years. I met another close friend in the eighth grade, and we shared a tense, 30-minute bus ride in complete silence — every passing second, I hated the concept of assigned seating more and more.
I want to say that when you meet your soul mate, whether it be your best friend or your significant other, it will be natural. Fluid. It will be like finding another piece of yourself. And yes, this is certainly true for some — some people have entered my life with ease and have stayed there, happily harmonious. Others, equally wonderful, had rocky, tentative steps — we dipped our toes into the pool and it was only after a few awkward glances and roundabout conversations that we jumped in.
So, who knows? I’ve had some explosions-in-the-sky first kisses that fell out of the heavens before the next sunrise, and I’ve had some chaste, barely-there first kisses that ultimately bloomed into something rapturous. If I had followed the advice that my mom gave me when I was five, I would have taken every first kiss as a sort of affirmation. A test: Why hello, potential suitor, I have a challenge for thee.
Normally, everything my mother says is true. This might just be, however, her one false kernel of truth. I nevertheless ate it up as a child and, unbeknownst to me, it got stuck in my teeth while chewing. But years later, I’ve finally fished it out. I’ll share a secret with you — it’s all mental, I’ve figured out (yes, this one probably took me a bit too long to realize). First kisses and their supposed magical properties, the frogs and mistletoe and New Year’s good luck: Adorable and wonderful, but potentially overrated.
But maybe not the dementors — that’s serious business.

It’s no wonder USC only holds one joint a cappella performance a year: Unleashing so much talent under one roof can be a little dangerous.
This year’s All Hail A Cappella concert, organized by USC a cappella group Reverse Osmosis and featuring other on-campus groups such as the Sirens, Trojan Men, Kosher Pig, SoCal Vocals and Troy Tones was a wild, explosive display of vocal talent — adjectives meant, of course, in the very best way.

Such a vibrant and energetic celebration of the human voice has come to be expected from the yearly fall show, which allows USC’s six a cappella groups to show off their distinctive personalities and appeal to prospective members.
A long line of excited fans and a cappella enthusiasts formed outside Bovard Auditorium early Monday night in anticipation for the concert. The crowd was rewarded for its patience with 90 minutes of nonstop (excluding a short intermission) vocal acrobatics, entertaining choreography and spine-tingling harmonies.
The Sirens, USC’s only all-female a cappella group, opened the evening with none other than the queen of pop: Britney Spears. The ladies performed an energetic rendition of “Circus,” creatively blended with another Spears number, “If You Seek Amy.” The group also performed soulful versions of Tom Cochrane’s “Life is a Highway” and John Hiatt’s “Have a Little Faith in Me.”
In true yin-yang fashion, the Trojan Men, USC’s only male a cappella group, followed the Sirens. Always a crowd pleaser, the group was welcomed by an outburst of whooping and hollering from the audience (mostly high-pitched).
The screams escalated to dizzying decibels as the group performed its highly entertaining, brilliantly choreographed (crotch grabs and all) rendition of Michael Jackson’s “P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing).” The men then slowed things down with their second song and concert staple, Etta James’ “At Last,” after which they picked up the pace again with its fun, energetic set closer, “Vehicle” by The Ides of March.
Kosher Pig, the newest member to USC’s a cappella family, took the stage next in bubblegum-pink Converse sneakers and metallic ’80s gear. The group established its funky personality in choreographed performances of the Beach Boys’ “I Get Around” and Jason Mraz’s “You And I.” A humorous medley featuring songs such as Starland Vocal Band’s “Afternoon Delight” and T.I.’s “Live Your Life,” spiced up with a beatboxing solo by sophomore Gabe DaMast, closed the set.
A short intermission paved the way for the SoCal Vocals, USC’s oldest co-ed a cappella group. The group, dressed in black concert attire (with cardinal-and-gold ties for the men), started the second half of the night with a pulsating performance of Basement Jaxx’s “Good Luck,” featuring the impressive pipes of junior Rachel Saltzman. The SoCal Vocals also performed Peter Gabriel’s “Down to Earth” from Wall · E and the group’s iconic arrangement of USC’s alma mater.
After the SoCal Vocals, the men and women of Troy Tones — famous for its outrageous costumes — stumbled onto the stage feigning hangovers, clutching bottles of alcohol and wearing the stained remnants of “last night.” The act was almost believable — that is until they burst out in pitch-perfect harmony.
The group performed spot-on renditions of Cutting Crew’s “(I Just) Died In Your Arms Tonight” and Matchbox Twenty’s “Downfall,” but the highlight of its set was an adorable rendition of “Kiss the Girl” from The Little Mermaid.
Reverse Osmosis closed the jam-packed night with three flawless performances. The group’s soaring harmonies took Kansas’ “Carry On My Wayward Son” to a new level; its slowed-down version of Coldplay’s “Fix You” was pure and moving; and a schizophrenic-but-splendid pop medley featuring Rihanna, Backstreet Boys and Toni Braxton had audience members dancing in their seats.
All Hail A Cappella 2009 was an occasionally outrageous, constantly impressive showcase of student talent that could have only been improved with a few more songs (and, for loyal fans who have heard most of it before, a few more new songs). Overall, the concert served its purpose to a T, displaying the groups’ unique personalities, showcasing some major singing chops and inspiring singers in the audience to join USC’s a cappella family.
All six groups will be holding auditions Wednesday from 6:30-11 p.m. in Taper Hall. Auditions may vary slightly, but singers are advised to prepare a verse and chorus from a song of their choice.

Forget Florida. As far as Angelenos are concerned, California is the Sunshine State. With all the time we spend on the beach, at the park, hiking in the hills and swimming in pools, it is no surprise that a big part of Los Angeles culture is the ability to get a sun-kissed tan — on a body that looks great showing it off, of course.
This past weekend was Labor Day weekend, a time when we bid farewell to barbecues and pool parties and our commitment-free existences, all the while allowing us to show off as much skin as we can before fall forces jeans and hoodies on us. Besides, who doesn’t want to show off the tan they’ve been working on during the summer?
Before and after · Tired of her pale skin tone, Daily Trojan reporter Shannon McHugh agreed to test out Spray Tan L.A.’s at-home services. The innovative mobile tan business was created by two recent alumnis. - Photos courtesy of Shannon McHugh
Yet, simply being from Los Angeles does not give you the inalienable right to the deep, rich tan worn by many of the city’s residents. It is a privilege, and I am one of those unprivileged — not to mention unlucky — individuals who can’t easily soak up the rays. With next-to-white, natural blonde hair and bright blue eyes, it’s not hard to imagine that my complexion starts as white as linen and, by the end of summer, the best attempt at a tan my skin can muster up is some sort of off-white color with crimson accents. That is why my best bet to get ready for Labor Day weekend fast was a spray tan.
So when I heard about Spray Tan L.A., a new mobile spray tanning company run by two USC alumni, I had to know all about it.
When I called them up and scheduled my appointment, a friendly male voice gave me all of my pre-tanning details: shave all unwanted body hair, exfoliate and don’t apply lotions, deodorants or anything else on the skin. Got it.
A Spray Tan L.A. stylist named Carli arrived at 10 a.m. the next morning with two bags packed to the brim. Once she entered my apartment, she immediately unzipped a circular bag and pulled out a folded up tent-like contraption; with one shake, it popped open into a tent that nearly hit the top of my ceiling.
Shortly after a detailed get-to-know-you conversation about my skin type, tone and what I was looking for in a tan, I stripped down to the nude (what girls will do to avoid tan lines!) in an open-faced tent in the middle of my living room with a stylist spraying a pH-prep spray on my body to prepare my skin for my tan. The conversation was very fluid and natural, like we were girlfriends talking about what we were doing this weekend, though I’m pretty sure most friends have those conversations clothed.
After a good bit of drying off, the tanning portion of the process began. Carli sprayed each side of me in an efficient and perfected way, making sure to avoid over-spraying and streaking. The smell of the spray wasn’t your typical spray tan smell; it had a hint of caramel to it, which I later learned was part of the company’s trademarked, all-organic spray. The whole process, which lasted about 45 minutes, ended with a quick and painless drying process and next-to-nothing clean up.
Simple, fast and easy — just what I was looking for.
Spray tanning has become a popular trend in the past couple years, and tanning salons have begun making a fortune on their various forms of the fad. The Mystic Tan — a UV-free spray tan that allows you to strip down and get into a small room where misters spray both sides of your body evenly — is the most cost-effective option for tanners. Some salons even hire professional airbrush stylists to do the work for you, spraying each side of your body with a close and careful eye — at a higher price.
With all the developments in the tanning world, it was only a matter of time before someone upped the game of the instant tan; and who better to do it than two USC alumni?
Rob Lonardo, a class of 2000 USC alumnus who majored in finance and marketing through the Marshall School of Business, had been a client of the tanning business for two years before he realized that he could improve it.
“I  became a spray tan client about two years ago,” Lonardo explained. “An ex-girlfriend of mine got me into it, and I fell in love with it. Spray tanning gave me a confidence and self-esteem that was overwhelming.”
As he got into it, he realized just how much he preferred the airbrush spray tan and stuck to that; when it came time for him to get resprayed, though, he had noticed that normal tanning salons which offered the airbrushing had timing complications.
“The hardest thing to do is to fit a tanning salon stylist into your schedule,” he said. “With their limited hours and limited staff, you need to plan almost two weeks in advance, and sometimes a tan is an impulse buy. You want it now.”
That’s when he and a fellow USC alumnus, Jesse Caetano started their business, Spray Tan L.A., a mobile spray tan service that comes to you, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.
“We’ll come to you, anytime, anywhere you need us,” Lonardo said. “College campuses, sororities, fraternities, movie sets, homes, strip clubs, you name it.”
Lonardo’s company also has another incentive to use his company; all of his spray products are completely organic and custom made. None of its products are used anywhere else in the country. It even has trademarked scents — such as Caramel and Coconut Paradise — that come in the sprays to alleviate the chemical-like smell that you would get with a normal spray tan.
The pampered, celebrity airbrush tanning stigma is a thing of the past; at least, that’s what Lonardo and Caetano are trying to accomplish. Their overly trained staff works to the satisfaction of its clients before anyone else, and always gives you what you ask for: elegant and efficient service fast.

Sometimes the unthinkable happens.
At least, that’s what most people are saying after hearing about Turkey and Armenia’s recent decision to open ties and resume cooperation with each other. The announcement was made last week when leaders of both nations introduced a plan to reinstate diplomatic relations and create bilateral ties.
Although the plan will have to pass both nations’ legislative houses, it is still hailed as a major diplomatic breakthrough by most in the international community. If the plan is passed, the nations will open their borders for each other for the first time in 15 years and will formally engage in cooperative diplomatic dialogue for the first time in decades.
The two nations have been so-called enemies since 1915, when over 1.5 million Armenians were killed under the supervision of the Turkish government at the time — at least, according to Armenia. Turkey insists that the killings were not a genocide and that the government did not officially sanction them. The correct labeling of the events of 1915, along with Turkey’s refusal to assume responsibility for its actions, has been a sore and emotional point of conflict for both sides.
This issue still brings passionate debate on both sides, as seen recently by the US Congress’ debate last year on whether to pass a resolution officially labeling the events of 1915 as genocide.
Along with the questions regarding the Armenian genocide, other points of conflict have arisen, including the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh, a province in neighboring Azerbaijan which Armenia supports in its breakaway from the state — something Turkey opposes. The province consists of mostly ethnic Armenians and thus  would be claimed by Armenia.
The recent negotiations began last September when Turkish President Abdullah Gul accepted an invitation by Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan to attend a soccer game in Armenia. The event itself was groundbreaking and set into motion the potential for dialogue.
Both nations have a lot to gain in these negotiations and both are actively participating. They can finally try to settle the question of Nagorno-Karabakh, thereby ending an uneasy stalemate. Furthermore, the warmer relationship could even start talks to create joint resolution regarding the Armenian genocide.
Although both goals are somewhat long-term, each nation is looking to gain short-term advantages in the Caucasus region as well as in the international community. By settling its issues with Turkey, its most powerful neighbor, Armenia can free itself up to more trade in the region. It can also try to profit from the region’s abundance of natural energy sources and begin building an infrastructure to export resources leading to economic development.
Turkey has even more to gain in these negotiations. By actively participating and engaging in peace talks, Turkey proves itself as a regional power. By taking active steps to solve regional crises, it asserts itself in the international community as a progressive nation looking to solve problems rather than create them. Turkey is still looking to become a member of the European Union, and settling its long-standing differences with Armenia may help its case.
The fact that two such hated rivals as Turkey and Armenia can solve their differences gives hope to other Black Sea nations, such as Russia and Georgia, to solve their international conflicts.
Finally, Turkey’s actions will give the nation a lot more diplomatic leverage and trust in the international community as a peace mediator and ally when it comes to solving international issues. The nation can even use its influence to help mediate the many violent conflicts in the Middle East — an action which could not only prove Turkey as a major power in the region, but also as one that could encourage Western nations to engage Turkey in solving the Middle East’s issues. Turkey has the potential to become an indispensable partner in the effort to bring peace to the Middle East, and in doing so is bound to be rewarded in greater trade and investment, helping its economic situation as well.
The benefits of this potential peace agreement are great for both sides, but the question remains whether the legislation will pass both nations’ parliaments. As of now, there will be a lot of negotiation that will have to be done in order to convince skeptics on both sides.
Hopefully, peace will prevail.

For Californians, drought is a common nuisance. Expensive cars are washed with less frequency, imported plants are left to the elements in would-be pristine yards and water bills are regarded with a wince. Nevertheless, people are never forced to forgo showering for a few days or wash dishes by hand rather than in the dishwasher. This is California, after all.
Not so for Mexicans currently experiencing the most severe drought their country has felt in 70 years. In Mexico City, the fine for hosing down a car or watering the lawn during peak daytime hours is anywhere between 1,500 and 15,000 pesos. Crops are wilting in the heat, and increasingly severe water rationing policies are forcing even the wealthy to cut back on their usage. Reservoir levels are dropping at an alarming rate, and, as crops across the country die in the heat, a serious food crisis looms on the horizon.
Importing food is a constant reality within the American economy, where most families never know exactly where their food comes from (or how ethically it was produced). For Mexico, which is already battling a severe recession, the increased costs of imported food could force many Mexican families to go without the staples of their normal diet. Fields of corn, beans, barley and sorghum have been hit particularly hard, causing losses of approximately 1 billion pesos for local farmers. The effects could be felt well into next year.
There is also the unspoken question of how the drought will affect Mexico’s massive illegal drug market. The Mexican drug war has been increasingly dangerous in recent years, but, with the drought, many crops may well dry up and die. Local purchases could decrease significantly as people without employment spend their money on food, rather than overpriced drugs.
Raised prices and lowered access to marijuana, cocaine and opiates could increase the in-fighting between competitive sellers, but other sources of employment would soon seem more appealing to smaller businesses. With fewer sellers on the streets, authorities may be better able to crack down on those who continue to make a business of the illegal drug market.
But for those whose everyday lives are interrupted by the terrible heat, economics is of secondary concern to the simple reality of finding water. In Mexico City, which has a population of 20 million people, some homes have their water cut off for up to six weeks without warning. Government trucks bring in bottles of water for residents, some of whom have attempted to commandeer the vehicles and ensure that their families have access to the precious resource.
An interesting part of Mexico City’s crisis is that the problem is not El Niño-induced  water scarcity, as in other areas. Rather, it is a question of managing abundance. Instead of flowing into the city’s underground aquifers, rainwater is channeled into sewers. So instead of relying on hurricanes and natural water flows into the area, the city has spent the last decade over-pumping water, emptying deposits and causing the city to sink, in some areas, by more than a foot a year.
American scientists are constantly innovating and finding new ways to protect natural resources, with water being a key issue in the current environmental discourse. Yet for those nations still battling to simply provide citizens with adequate access to resources, finding a place in the budget for research and restructuring of major systems is nearly impossible.
Although Mexico is feeling the heat today, environmentalists warn that even the United States could face serious consequences sooner than anyone might think. As global warming continues to heat up Earth, every individual, even those who can afford it, should make responsible consumption a priority.

Cheney slams Obama. Jon slams Kate. Chavez slams Israel. Karzai slams NATO. Amazon slams Google. Sony slams Apple.
If we were to take this spate of recent headlines at face value, boy, what a barbarous culture we would look like — what with people slamming people slamming organizations slamming countries slamming people. It seems we’re stuck in an endless wrestling match, but the biggest loser won’t be one of us. It will surely be the English language, bruised and battered by the media’s lazy devotion to uninventive writing.
Case in point: the word “slam.”
It can be a vigorous and evocative verb when well used — “car slams into tree” packs quite a punch; “mother slams child,” even more so. In its colloquial sense as “criticize,” however, “slam” has been so overused as to strip it of any remaining freshness.
Aided by unimaginative writers, “slam” has crept into the copy of nearly every important national publication, from the Los Angeles Times to the normally irreproachable Daily Trojan, and by now has become the go-to verb for anything remotely meaning “criticize.”
Was there something wrong with “criticize” — or “lambaste,” “denounce,” “rebuke,” “reproach,” “scold,” “condemn,” “discredit” or “censure,” which are surely more meaningful alternatives? One rarely sees those words in headlines, especially now that “slam” is the new national obsession, even when it’s almost never the best word.
Cheney reproached Obama, he didn’t slam him — Jon bad-mouthed Kate, Chavez criticized Israel and Karzai condemned NATO.
Is “slam” more accessible than “lambaste” to the so-called average reader (a label, incidentally, which should insult us)? Maybe, but only because of the media’s systematic vulgarization of the English language, and our willingness to go along with it. It is the fault both of an unengaged media and an uncaring public that “slam” has replaced stronger, more robust verbs in our national discourse.
For goodness sake, even Google knows the phrase “Cheney slams Obama”: It completes it for you after you type “Cheney sla.”
And it isn’t as though “slam” is even a good replacement for “criticize,” a meaning the Oxford English Dictionary lists fifth and calls informal. So by using “slam,” we’re not only imbuing our language with more violence than it needs (read almost any story about the Los Angeles county Station fire and count the references to war and battle), but we’re also perpetuating colloquial, substandard English.
Enough already. This overuse and misuse of “slam” needs to end quickly, before we completely forget the better words it has come to replace. Of course, this is not to say that the word should be abandoned entirely. Doors should still slam shut in shocked faces and we should all still slam on the brakes before barreling slam-bang into some pesky deer or bicycling tourist on the road. Anything beyond that, though, and we should find a better verb.
Some might find this argument trivial and slam me for nitpicking over tiny details. Obviously, that would be missing the point, which is this: Language reflects those who speak it. The fairly recent proliferation of slipshod, imprecise English — of which “slam” is but one example, others being such meaningless phrases as “usher in,” “shore up,” “bone up on” and the persistent “irregardless” — reflects a slow but steady degeneration of mental acuity, which filters down from careless writers to the general public.
The media has a responsibility not only to seek the truth and report it, but also to enrich the national consciousness. Falling back on unoriginal verbal conveniences like “slam” does the exact opposite: It dumbs us down, muddies our mental waters and, taken to the extreme, makes us all unthinking conformists.
In 1984, the ever-prescient George Orwell satirized the degeneration of the English language as a shrinkage of thought. He called it “Newspeak,” a strictly regimented, utterly colorless language. Thankfully, we’re not there yet, and merely using “slam” ad nauseam, however maddening, will not empty English of its idiosyncratic beauties.
But Orwell got it precisely right: ruin language and you ruin thought. What seems trivial now might become the greatest tragedy of all.

Drivers can now feel a little safer parking their cars near USC.
Last week, the Los Angeles Police Department arrested two individuals they believe may be responsible for stealing more than 60 catalytic converters from around the Los Angeles area,
including at USC.
Catalytic converter theft has run rampant at USC and in the surrounding area, according to Capt. David Carlisle of USC’s Department of Public Safety. Carlisle said there were more than 20 thefts both in 2008 and so far in 2009.
Catalytic converters — part of a vehicle’s exhaust system — are stolen because they contain trace amounts of valuable metals, including platinum, palladium and rhodium. Thieves can sell the converters to metal recyclers who can use the precious metals.
Most of the time, the converters were stolen from Toyota pickup trucks, because the converters are easily accessible on those models, Carlisle said.
“It’s something that occurs all the time and we started having those thefts, so that really comes to our attention as a specific problem,” Carlisle said.
The Sept. 4 arrest of two suspects — 28-year-old Juan Calderon and 36-year-old Christopher Williams — came as the result of a joint investigation between LAPD, DPS and UCLA’s campus police force.
“Our detectives have been working with LAPD all along in coordinating dates and times and these pieces of information so LAPD would have a clear picture of any trends,” Carlisle said.
The two men were arrested by LAPD Pacific-LAX detectives after officers witnessed them removing a catalytic converter from a car parked on USC’s campus.
According to Carlisle, LAPD has recovered eight converters so far and expects to recover more.
“While we know these suspects completed at least one theft in a structure on campus … I suspect they were responsible for most, if not all,” Carlisle said.
LAPD will continue to investigate the series of thefts in an attempt to determine how many converter thefts Williams and Calderon were involved in.
Calderon is currently being held without bail and Williams is being held on $20,000 bail.
Officer Bruce Borihanh, a spokesman for LAPD, said the two will likely face charges of vehicle tampering, burglary from a motor vehicle and receiving stolen property.
Anyone with information regarding catalytic converter crimes is asked to call Pacific-LAX Detective Axel De Leon, at (310) 577-3473.

Recent sightings of a Campus Cruiser-like vehicle have prompted USC’s Department of Public Safety to warn students to look out for unmarked and unauthorized minivans similar in style and color to Campus Cruisers.
On two separate occasions, a van offering free rides to female students has been spotted near campus. Because of the van’s color and style, DPS is concerned students may confuse it for a Campus Cruiser vehicle.

“There is a possibility that it is an unapproved, unauthorized taxi service trying to make money, but our concern is that their intent is something much more serious,” said DPS Capt. David Carlisle.
On Monday, DPS released an informational bulletin to students about the two incidents, despite the fact that no actual offense had been committed.
“As soon as it appeared that there may be additional suspicious circumstances we decided that we needed to get the information out to the student body,” Carlisle said.
Campus Cruiser is the only university-affiliated service authorized to pick up students who request rides.
The program now notifies students when their car has arrived at the designated site, creating additional safety and precaution measures for students.
The unmarked van was first spotted on Aug. 21 at 4:30 p.m., when it was reported to be driving along the 1000-1300 block of
W. 29th Street offering rides, Carlisle said.
“The people that were operating the van were offering the rides to females. They had followed one female for a block or so, trying to entice her into the van, saying that they were a new university free ride service,” Carlisle said.
The complainant described the driver in the first incident as having long dark hair, sunglasses and a black beanie-type hat. Both the driver and passenger were described as male Hispanics from the initial report and DPS camera footage.
DPS video surveillance captured the alleged vehicle, which DPS says is a gold minivan with custom black and chrome rims and dual sliding doors, possibly a Dodge Caravan.
Another van — likely the same vehicle — appeared near campus again this past weekend.
Carlisle said a similar metallic tan or bronze colored van was spotted on 28th Street near University Avenue early morning on Sept. 6. The report filed by the student describes the occupants of the van as light-skinned males, possibly Hispanic and wearing black short-sleeved shirts. At
2:25 a.m., the student report reveals that the van occupants offered a free ride to a female.
“A similar van to that was observed Saturday night along The Row,” Carlisle said. “We had another incident where a suspicious van was reported that was white, that was seen in the North University Park area, but we’re not sure if that’s connected.”
About a half-hour later, a USC Community Service Officer spotted a van matching the description given by students at 28th and Hoover streets. The officer recorded the vehicle’s license plate, but the plate was traced back to a different van.
“Officers were unable to catch up with the van to try to detain it,” Carlisle said.
Carlisle said the license plate might have been recorded incorrectly. It is unlikely that the van is using stolen plates, he said.
DPS ran variations on the recorded license plate, but has not made any progress in locating the specific vehicle. The DPS and LAPD investigation is still underway.
Students said they were concerned after reading the bulletin from DPS.
Alexis Nichols, a senior majoring in communication, said she was scared by the DPS notification.
“I’m glad to be aware of that kind of thing,” she said.
Nichols added that it is important for students to receive DPS emails and to be notified of potential safety issues around the USC campus.
Tiffany Schallert, a senior majoring in Russian, said, “It was clearly very upsetting … I hope it was just upperclassmen that were getting the offers because they would know that Campus Cruiser doesn’t do that.”
Carlisle noted that only Campus Cruiser vehicles are authorized to give free rides to USC students, and all Cruiser vehicles are clearly marked.
Carlisle urges anyone with information regarding the vehicle or its occupants to contact DPS at (213) 740-6000. If any students come into contact with a suspicious vehicle offering free rides to students should call DPS immediately at (213) 740-4321.

After negotiating for seven months and demonstrating last week in the hopes of winning a better contract offer, the Aramark-contracted maintenance employees at USC overwhelmingly approved a new contract at the union meeting on Saturday.
The contract, which will be in effect for the next three years, was approved by nearly 99 percent of the Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West members, according to Raphael Lieb, an internal organizer for the union.
Lieb said last Wednesday’s on-campus march was a turning point in the union’s negotiations with Aramark.
“When the employer came back that day they came back with some major improvements,” Lieb said. “I think that’s due in no small part to support from the university community.”
One of the main points of contention during negotiations was the health insurance co-pay, which Aramark wanted to raise drastically. The approved contract raises the co-pay only slightly.
The approved contract also stipulates that wages will be increased in concurrence with the cost of living over the next three years. Additionally, janitors will be able to cash out unused sick and vacation time, something they were unable to do before, Lieb said.
The union was prepared to strike if an agreement was not met by this weekend. A week ago a strike seemed likely but after the march things turned around, Lieb said.
“Going into last week it was still a possibility,” Lieb said. “We were still far away from where we wanted to be. I think what made a huge difference was the university community’s willingness to step up and help support the janitors.”
The contract, which the vast majority of the maintenance staff voted to approve, is dramatically improved from what Aramark had proposed just a week ago, Lieb said.
Though they made some sacrifices, Lieb said it seemed most members of the maintenance staff were happy with the outcome.
“It’s actually a really exciting victory for USC janitors because they’re able to make some great gains in the context of a really rough economy,” Lieb said.

Zipping around LA is about to get a little easier for USC students.
Zipcar, a nationwide car-sharing program that rents cars by the hour or day to registered members, plans to add 12 additional cars to the USC area this month.
Zip · A Zipcar sits in a parking lot outside of Century Apartments near the USC campus. Zipcars are available to rent on an hourly or daily basis. Drivers can make reservations online or by phone to get a car in a specific location and at a specific time. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan
There are currently 16 Zipcars available on campus, but the new addition — six more cars on campus and six in the North University Park area — will boost the amount to 28.
“The program is doing amazingly well,” said Matthew Malloy, vice president of global university operations at Zipcar. “More and more students are joining every day. We’re getting hundreds of members joining on a regular basis.”
Bernard C. Parks, who represents the Los Angeles City Council’s District 8, which encompasses North University Park and USC’s campus, said he is certain the partnership with Zipcar will be a positive step in solving LA’s environmental and space issues.
“There will be less cars in the North University Park area,” Parks said. “The fact that people can share cars will cause a decrease in the need for more cars.”
Zipcars are available for members 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The cars are keyless; instead, members swipe a card to unlock and start any available car parked in a Zipcar space.
Gas is included in both the day-long fee and the $8 to $9 hourly rate. Members can make reservations for specific timeslots and locations online or by phone.
Malloy said Zipcar has high hopes for the success of its expanded presence at USC.
“We expect to see it continuously expanding through to spring,” Malloy said.
Placing more Zipcars in North University Park required a partnership between Zipcar, USC Transportation and the City of Los Angeles, who are all working together to solve problems such as air pollution and overcrowded parking facilities.
The Los Angeles City Council has also been cooperating with Zipcar and USC in a car-sharing pilot program. The program is meant to gauge the potential of car sharing in Los Angeles in the two highly populated areas near USC and UCLA for a year.
So far, the pilot program has been widely successful and a more permanent program is in store, as well as possible expansion to other areas in Los Angeles.
Parks said he had no problem deciding to form the partnership with Zipcar, and he hopes an increase in Zipcar use will reduce congested traffic and the city’s carbon footprint.
USC Transportation could be not reached for comment.
Kaitlin Everly, a junior majoring in international relations, said an increase in Zipcars would make reserving a car much easier.
“It’s awesome, because though the Zipcars are usually available during the weekdays, when it comes to the weekends, I have to reserve it days in advance,” Everly said.
Everly said she has been using Zipcar for about a year, and almost every week during the summer, to go shopping and to dance classes.
“I really like it,” she said. “It’s very easy to use, and so easy for me to get around places.”
Other students have not had such positive experiences.
David McAlpine, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences and broadcast journalism, cancelled his Zipcar membership this year after using it sporadically as a freshman.
“I thought I was going to use it more,” McAlpine said. “But I ended up not using it much. I just got my own car instead this year.”
