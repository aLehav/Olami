There has been an outbreak of mumps, a viral disease that causes intense swelling of the salivary glands, at UC Berkeley, according to a schoolwide email sent Tuesday night  by Lawrence Neinstein, a professor of pediatrics and medicine at the USC Keck School of Medicine.
The disease is transmitted through respiratory droplets, Neinstein said in the email. The disease can be spread through the sharing of drinks, cigarettes and towels.
UC Berkley has 15 confirmed and 15 suspected cases of the mumps, according to The Daily Californian.
The outbreak began when a student was exposed to the disease while in Great Britain. When he returned to UC Berkeley, he developed symptoms and it spread to other students, according to The Daily Californian.
To prevent contracting the disease, the University Park Health Center advises students to regularly wash their hands, cover their mouths when coughing and avoid close contact with anyone who is ill.
Half of people infected with the mumps have very mild or no symptoms, so they might not know they are infected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disease has a 12- to 25-day incubation period.
USC requires all students to receive two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines. The health center strongly advises students who have not yet received the vaccination to get one at the health center before traveling to UC Berkeley.
Past outbreaks, however, have revealed half of all mumps patients received two doses of the vaccine before contracting the disease, according to The Daily Californian.
Other symptoms of the mumps include mild swelling of testicles and loss of voice.

The intersection of technology and everyday life was pushed in a new direction Tuesday in McCarthy Quad, as more than 50 students and alumni traversed hula-hoops, iPhones in hand and tough questions around every turn.
Survey says · Mariana Aguilar explains how her “Immersive Life Size Survey” works to Chris Clapis, a sophomore majoring in computer science. - Mindy Curtis | Daily Trojan
As part of her thesis project, Mariana Aguilar, a senior majoring in social sciences with an emphasis in psychology, set up the “Immersive Life Size Survey” on campus to test the impact meshing technology, multimedia literacy and everyday life with surveying real-time experiences.
“People are more comfortable and more interested when technology is involved,” Aguilar said. “Being in a life-size space [with technology] where, depending on how you answered a question, you would move through space differently, you weigh the questions more heavily.”
Aguilar’s project represents recognition of the growing importance real-time multimedia experiences will play in the coming years, according to Holly Willis, a research assistant professor and director of academic programs for the Institute for Multimedia Literacy.
“Technology is increasingly becoming interwoven into everyday life,” Willis said. “People crave being out in the world and connecting with people.”
The project, supported through IML and the School of Cinematic Arts, aims to investigate the differences between survey responses in a physical setting with a multimedia aspect against responses to more traditional computer surveys.
Participants in Tuesday’s survey were presented with three preliminary identification questions and five survey questions. They began the survey at the center hula-hoop and moved outward to the next hoop, depending on each answer.
“I wanted to look at how people make different decisions in different media,” Aguilar said.
Survey participant David Saller, a USC graduate with a bachelor’s degree in history, said he felt the survey was unique in the way it challenged him to weigh his options in a more physical space.
“[The survey] allows you to understand that your response is going to dictate something,” Saller said. “You know that obliquely when you’re taking a survey but after the first question [in a physical setting] you realize whatever you answer is going to effect where you move. It challenges you to be more honest.”
Responses to the five questions, which ranged from simple informational questions to ethical and moral dilemmas, were recorded with the smartphone app “Scan” with Quick Response codes attached to large pegs near each hoop. After completing the survey, the five hoops each participant visited were mapped visually along the route the participant took.
Aguilar said she hopes to determine the effect of combining real-life experiences with multimedia by comparing the maps of the participants in the “life-size” setting against those from survey-takers who answered the same questions at a computer.
According to Aaron Harris, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering, the experience was far different than simply sitting behind a computer to take a survey.
“It was an interesting way to use new forms of media to tie into old [methods] of gathering data,” Harris said.
Technology and new media crossing into daily life is something Saller expects will define the way people interact with each other in the coming years.
“Interactivity is the way of the future,” Saller said.
This intersection of real-life experiences and multimedia aspects gave Aguilar the chance to attract students to her project, all while exploring the way technology changes students’ everyday lives.
“Technology is, after all, the way to get the attention of our generation,” Aguilar said.

At the age of 34, Jay Carson has served as former Sen. Hillary Clinton’s Traveling press secretary, has taught at USC as an adjunct professor, has been called the greatest media mind of his generation and — as if his résumé were not impressive enough — has served as the inspiration for a George Clooney film, The Ides of March.
The film is loosely based on Howard Dean’s 2004 presidential campaign, during which Carson served as the campaign’s media strategist. Carson’s close friend, playwright Beau Willimon, also worked as a staffer on the campaign and wrote a play and movie script about what he saw behind the scenes. The script evolved into The Ides of March, which hit screens last weekend.  Though Willimon and Carson claim the main character, Stephen Myers, is fictional, many people have said Carson is  the inspiration.
“It is a slippery road to go down what is real and what’s not,” Carson said.  “I was a young press secretary on a presidential campaign. And Beau watched as I, and lot of people in those positions, were faced with very difficult choices every day.”
The film follows Stephen as he makes those difficult choices, many times failing to make the right one.
Despite all the pressure and contentious situations, Carson still looks back on his political campaign days as worthwhile.
“I very much believe in our system of government and very much believe … in the ability for government to really help people in a way other entities can’t,” Carson said.  “I never lost that belief. You can become more realistic about how the process works, but it doesn’t mean you don’t believe in the system any less.”
Carson admits to being the idealistic character portrayed in the film at the start of his career, but said he does not regret a moment of the path he took, even the long hours he spent paying his dues.
“There’s no substitute for hard work,” Carson said.  “You have to work extremely hard, especially at a young age.  Part of that is not believing you’re too good — I think this applies to every industry.”
For example, Carson said while working his first campaign during college he was asked to reorganize the supply closet. After reorganizing it three times, because his superior was still not satisfied, he finally got his break when an older staffer was impressed with his dedication.
“If you do the grunt work early on, you’ll be given the more senior work,” Carson said.
Wide-eyed and taking Washington by storm, Carson did move up quickly.  Pretty soon he was calling the shots while still in his 20s.
But 10 years later, with countless campaigns under his belt, Carson has decided to move on. As the media industry evolves and becomes more fast-paced, Carson saw evolution in his own life as well.
“I actually moved intentionally away from the [media relations] job a while ago,” Carson said. “One of the reasons I moved away from that job was that it was becoming a different job in a way that wasn’t something I necessarily wanted to be doing anymore.”
Now Carson works with city governments around the world to help them with climate change-based initiatives.
“[Working in media relations] is very helpful training, I just wanted to take that training, and apply it to something else — not keep it limited to talking to reporters,” Carson said.
But the mark he made on Washington and his influence on politics will not fade so quickly.  For his entire career, Carson stayed behind the scenes; now, thanks to The Ides of March, it is his time to shine.

More than 700 caregivers in scrubs and lab coats will form picket lines outside the Keck Medical Center of USC today to voice grievances in contract negotiations.
Short-staffing at the hospital, stagnant benefits and a proposed one-year wage freeze are among the issues picketers hope to address, said Leighton Woodhouse, director of communications for the National Union of Healthcare Workers.
“Workers are now at the point where they feel it’s necessary to send a message to the employer and educate the public about what they are fighting for,” Woodhouse said.
The strike is being organized by the NUHW, a group that represents USC employees ranging from respiratory care practitioners to surgical technicians. The strike is scheduled to last 24 hours, but university officials said NUHW’s permit with the city is only for 12 hours.
The caregivers represented by NUHW do not receive the same retirement plan and family tuition assistance as hospital nurses and most other university employees, according to Woodhouse. Picketers also feel they are unable to provide adequate care because the size of their staff is insufficient to fulfill their responsibilities.
Hospital CEO Mitch Creem said in a press release Tuesday that the picketers collect competitive compensation and benefits in comparison to other local hospitals.
“Currently, our NUHW employees receive a wage and benefits package that is competitive in the market,” Creem said. “While we are unable to discuss the specifics of our proposals publicly, we can say that our NUHW employees are among the highest paid in the region. At a time when many competitors are demanding concessions, we have offered numerous enhancements.”
Hospital management plans to implement extra security precautions and has used an agency to find replacements for employees on strike. It also posted information about the strike for its employees and patients on its website Monday.
“Our management team has been working steadfastly to implement our strike action plan to ensure smooth operations and the safe working environment that our patients, families and employees expect and deserve,” Creem said.
The caregivers on strike, who were formally represented by another union, have been negotiating a first contract with NUHW since August of last year and voted to authorize the strike, Woodhouse said. Earlier this year, caregivers staged an informational picket, where employees protested during breaks but did not stop working.
The federal government issued complaints against the hospital after NUHW filed labor charges for unfair conduct, according to Woodhouse. The hearing is scheduled for Oct. 24.
“The government looked at the charges, agreed with them, and now will have hearings to determine whether the hospital is, in fact, in violation of the law,” Woodhouse said.

USC assistant head coach Monte Kiffin has historically made a habit of designing defensive schemes more than capable of shutting down opposing offenses.
Take it away · Junior safety T.J. McDonald intercepted two passes from Arizona senior quarterback Nick Foles during the Trojans game on Oct. 1. Foles had not thrown an interception prior to the game. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Kiffin, whose pedigree dates to his nearly-three-decade coaching stint in the NFL, has, however, watched the Trojan defense regress somewhat in recent weeks. Against Arizona, the Trojans allowed a school record 37 first downs and 554 yards. It also marked the first time in program history they had ever surrendered more than 40 points in consecutive weeks.
But with last Saturday marking their first bye week of the season, the Trojans remain hopeful the additional practice hours will help them as they travel to San Francisco on Wednesday for a nationally televised game against California a day later.
“The biggest thing is that we transfer what we get in the film room to the field,” junior safety T.J. McDonald said. “It all comes down to execution and making sure that we execute on the things that we are supposed to.”
Kiffin has been criticized on several occasions this season for the lack of consistency with the defense. In the Trojans’ last two games against Arizona and Arizona State, USC has surrendered an average of 42 points and allowed 473 total yards of offense, compared to just 16 points and 318 yards in its matchups against Minnesota, Utah and Syracuse.
“Earlier in the year we were playing better,” Kiffin said. “We were rocking and rolling a little bit. Then the two Arizona schools got to us.”
—
Because of the Thursday game,  Tuesday’s practice marked the team’s final day of preperations for its second road game of the season.
Having had one more week to prepare and rest, junior quarterback Matt Barkley believes the timing is right to recharge, especially for the underclassmen.
“It gives you a physical rest when you’re still getting mental reps,” he said. “It was a chance for a lot of the younger, inexperienced players to get plays and keep them involved.
—
Cal comes into Thursday’s matchup averaging just less than 40 points per contest, which ranks ninth nationally in the nation. With a strong offensive opponent on the horizon, USC is hoping to slow down the Golden Bears’ passing attack.
Junior quarterback Zach Maynard has already thrown for 1,291 yards and 11 touchdowns through five games. He also has a pair of receivers in senior Marvin Jones and sophomore Keenan Allen who have combined for 1,109 yards and seven touchdowns this year.
“It’s got to get better,” Kiffin said. “Nick [Perry] has done a good job, but we need the other guys to pick it up.”
Sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey expressed similar sentiments.
“We always strive to be perfect every Saturday [or Thursday],” Robey said. “It’s a big road game for us being that it’s only our second game on the road. It is really important for us to come out there and set the tempo.”
—
In 2010, USC defeated Cal 48-14 at the Coliseum. USC coach Lane Kiffin, however, is not worried about the Trojans coming into AT&T Park  overconfident.
“This is a different team,” he said. “We’re going to have our hands full going on the road.”
—
Redshirt freshman quarterback Jesse Scroggins has been cleared to practice after being sidelined from injury. Scroggins has been sidelined since the middle of August after having surgery on his throwing thumb.
“Jesse is back out here throwing and is cleared to play,” Lane Kiffin said. “We will throw him right back in the mix and hopefully he will be the backup.”
Senior defensive end Armond Armstead was present at practice and will join the team on the road in San Francisco. Armstead was sidelined from an undisclosed medical condition in the spring and will not play this season.
“His number one focus right now is getting his degree,” Lane Kiffin said. “He has a big decision to make in December/January whether he decides to come back and help us win a championship or if he decides to go to the NFL.”
—
It has not been confirmed whether redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris and freshman linebacker Lamar Dawson will be playing this week against Cal.
“We will look at them tomorrow and move them around,” Lane Kiffin said. “Hopefully they will be ready to go.”
I hope the team gets better too.

Though rain initially put a damper on things, the season has finally teed off for the USC men’s golf team.
After being forced to withdraw from the Husky Invitational in Seattle last month because of rain, the Trojans secured a 10th-place finish Tuesday at The Prestige at PGA West in La Quinta, Calif. The invitational, which began Sunday, marked the first event they completed this season after its opener was rained out.
The course’s desert environment, however, proved to be a challenging task for an inexperienced Trojans team.
“This was our first event,” USC coach Chris Zambri said. “We go into every event hoping to place first, it was disappointing because we didn’t even come close.”
But the Trojans won’t be subjected to that same desert landscape they encountered at The Prestige for the remainder of the season.
USC finished 10th at 3-under-par with a final score of 861 — 29 strokes behind first-place Oregon, which posted a score of 832 in the 16-team field.
Washington took second at 834, while Stanford finished third with 840.
“It’s a little different around the green, more grainy than we are used to playing on,” Zambri said about the course at PGA West.
Sophomore Ramsey Sahyoun had the second-highest finish for USC, leading it to the final round of The Prestige.
Sahyoun tied for 24th overall at 3-under-par.
On the front nine, Sahyoun’s 1-over-par and three birdies helped nullify the double bogeys.
He completed the back nine with three birdies and finished 2-under-par.
This is the second best finish for Sahyoun — the first coming from his play at Gifford Intercollegiate last season.
But freshman Anthony Paolucci, who made his debut for USC, proved to be the team’s top finisher, tying for 17th overall.
Also playing individually, Paolucci finished 5-under-par.
In his final round, Paolucci, who began on a shotgun start on the 10th hole, had 3-under-par on the front nine, 3-under-par on the back nine and seven birdies total.
Despite a 10th-place-finish, Zambri said the Trojans played well over the course of the three days.
“We had one player shoot a couple rounds under par,” he said. “Another player played three solid rounds and finished well.”
Others opened with solid performances as well.
Junior Sam Smith tied for 39th at The Prestige at 1-over-par. Fellow junior Martin Trainer tied for 49th at 3-over-par. Sophomore Jeffrey Kang tied for 55th at 4-over-par. Senior Steve Lim tied for 64th 8-over-par.
The team hopes to take their experience from The Prestige and continue to improve over the course of the upcoming months of the season.
As Zambri discussed the need to work on better ball control and manageable targets, the Trojans will head east later this month to Alpharetta, Ga., on Oct. 23 to compete in the U.S. Collegiate Championship.
The event will be hosted by Georgia Tech.

As much as the weekday trip to California has thrown off the Bay Area travel plans of USC students and alumni, it’s not all bad news for the Trojan football program.
Recruiting ace · USC coach Lane Kiffin has built consecutive top-five recruiting classes. Playing on ESPN on Thursday will help that continue. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
Thursday night’s game will be televised nationally, meaning a lot of eyes will be on USC coach Lane Kiffin’s crew.
It’s not like USC is starving for attention — the cardinal and gold uniforms are some of the most recognizable in college football and the Los Angeles market is the second biggest in the country.
With the Trojans out of the top 25 and the national title race, however, USC highlights are no longer the lead story on SportsCenter. Though that might not seem like a big deal, a school’s national prominence matters to recruits.
Every time USC steps on the field, there’s more than a win or loss on the line.
Recruits are looking for a variety of things when deciding where they will next take their talents, including a coaching staff that shows genuine interest in them, a desirable location, guaranteed playing time and good academics. Chief among them, at least for the top prospects, is choosing a nationally prominent program with a chance to win conference and national titles.
Dozens of the country’s top prep players will flip to ESPN on Thursday night to see if the Trojans are still relevant.
Fourteen of the 25 best high school seniors have yet to decide where they will play football next year, according to Yahoo Sports’ Rivals.com’s rankings.
This game, and this recruiting season, comes at a crucial time for Kiffin and his staff.
USC’s bowl ban will end after this year but the Trojans are far from out of the woods of NCAA sanctions.
Kiffin will only be able to offer 15 scholarships per year to prospective recruits over the next three seasons, while other schools can sign up to 25 players.
The Trojans can only carry 75 scholarship players on the roster between 2012 and 2014; the upper limit for non-sanctioned programs is 85.
Kiffin has been forced to be more judicious in the scholarships he gives out. Recruiting mistakes will loom larger than ever.
With a full roster, the Trojans have been able to effectively deal with the transfers of one-time elite recruits Blake Ayles, Jarvis Jones, Byron Moore and Markeith Ambles, all of whom are no longer with the program.
It won’t be as easy to hit the reset button in the future.
By most accounts, Kiffin and company are doing a good job adjusting to the limitations. Though the Trojans have earned commitments from only 11 players in the class of 2012 (compared to 23 for Michigan, 20 for LSU and 19 for Alabama), the emphasis has been on quality over quantity.
Rivals rates USC’s class as the best in the nation on a talent per recruit basis. Scout.com shows only five programs nationally with more commitments than USC from the top 100 high school seniors.
The Trojans will need that type of talent influx if they are to ride out the remainder of the sanctions and return to competing for national championships.
USC’s last nine recruiting classes have been ranked in the top 10 nationally by Rivals and Scout, two of the leading recruiting websites.
The rankings are far from scientific and have been called inaccurate by some of the nation’s top college coaches.
Still, they provide fans with a good idea of which teams are doing a good job bringing in top young talent.
For example, in the five years preceding Alabama’s 2009 national championship, the Crimson Tide’s recruiting classes were respectively ranked No. 5, No. 1, No. 1, No. 10 and No. 11 by Rivals.
Florida’s 2008 title squad — the Gators also notched a BCS title in 2006 in Urban Meyer’s second season with the program — was similarly made up of five classes ranked 11th, third, first, second and 15th in the country.
USC had the nation’s top-ranked recruiting class by either Scout or Rivals each year from 2003 to 2006.
It’s no coincidence, then, that the Trojans went 48-4 during that span and won two Associated Press national titles.
High school seniors across the country watched as the Trojans outscored their opponents by an average of more than 22 points per game over the course of those four seasons.
Matt Leinart, Reggie Bush and Pete Carroll became national celebrities, while USC became the leading destination for the best prep players in the country. In college football, winning begets more winning.
NCAA-levied sanctions, a coaching change, a litany of transfers and some bad luck have dropped the Trojans from those lofty heights in the years since.
Still, Kiffin and his staff are some of the best recruiters in college football.
After all, current defensive coordinator and recruiting coordinator Ed Orgeron served in a similar capacity under Carroll dating from 2001-2003.
During the latter two seasons, the Trojans won an Orange Bowl title and an AP national title following a resounding 28-14 win over Michigan in the 2004 Rose Bowl.
Every once in a while, however, you have to win a big game on national television to keep the kids interested.

During an Oct. 16 game at McDonald’s Swim Stadium last season, California attacker Ivan Rackov, then a junior, did little to endear himself to a sportsmanlike USC men’s water polo team.
Tough act to stop · USC faces No. 2 California on Saturday in Berkeley, Calif., and must contend with senior attack Ivan Rackov — the reigning winner of the Peter J. Cutino Award — given annually to the nation’s top collegiate water polo player. - Photo courtesy of The Daily Californian
 
Upon scoring his third goal of the match on a crafty long-distance shot in the second quarter, helping the Golden Bears jump out to an 8-2 halftime lead, Rackov pointed at USC goalie Joel Dennerley, waving three fingers in the air to signify his hat-trick clinching goal.
Though California eventually won 12-9, Rackov’s boastful jab surprised many, considering just a month earlier USC had topped Rackov and company in the semifinals of the NorCal tournament en route to winning the tournament title.
“Personally, do I care for some of his antics,” senior driver Peter Kurzeka asked rhetorically. “You know — to each his own. He was awarded the best water polo player in the country, so he’s free to do what he wants, and we’re not here to judge that.”
USC faces Rackov and No. 2 Cal on Saturday at the Spieker Aquatics Complex in Berkeley, Calif., looking to notch its third win in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play.
Despite Rackov’s decorated résumé, USC isn’t flinching.
“We’re going to worry about our own game,” Kurzeka said.
Though USC prides itself on a diverse scoring attack — 10 different Trojans scored in the team’s 13-3 rout of No. 12 Loyola Marymount last Saturday, there is no confusion as to whom Cal will feature as its main trigger man.
Rackov, winner of the Peter J. Cutino Award as the top male collegiate water polo player in 2010, unquestionably remains the Golden Bears’ most prolific player, according to Dennerley.
“He’s probably the most dominating player out there right now,” Dennerley said. “He led the NCAA in scoring by a lot last season. He’s a guy who’s dangerous wherever he is in the pool, and is Cal’s biggest weapon.”
The numbers, at least, confirm Dennerley’s assessment.
Last season Rackov’s tallied 79 goals — an average of 2.8 goals per contest. By comparison, sophomore driver Nikola Vavic, USC’s leading goal scorer in 2010, finished with 49 goals.
Rackov’s well-rounded skill set makes him nearly impossible to defend.
“He has a really strong water polo IQ, where he just sees the game really well,” Kurzeka said. “He’s fast, and he has a great shot.”
This season Rackov appears as if he might even shatter last season’s mark, as he has already registered 49 goals through the Golden Bears’ first 16 games — a pace that would surpass last season’s goal mark, especially if Cal is able to play deep into the postseason.
Though USC and Cal’s offensive numbers are strikingly similar these last two seasons, with both teams consistently averaging around the 13 goals per game mark, the way these two programs strategize their attacks is a study in contrast.
USC features seven different players who have scored at least 10 goals this season, and its leading goal scorer, Kurzeka, has only accounted for 14 percent (21 of 149) of the team’s total scoring. By contrast, Rackov has accounted for 25 percent (49 of 196) of Cal’s goals thus far. As a result, the Golden Bears’ offense often ebbs and flows depending on his play.
Though Rackov’s talent remains undeniable, it is his demonstrative demeanor that has irked some of the veteran Trojans in the past.
“He’s a good water polo player,” Kurzeka said. “Some may not like him, but everyone always hates the best player. He scores a lot of goals, and he always has the ball in his hand like the best player usually does.”
For all his offensive prowess, Rackov would likely exchange some of his goal scoring these last few seasons for the three NCAA championship titles his USC senior counterparts possess.
After all, the Trojans got the best of Rackov and the Golden Bears last season.
In the 2010 NCAA title game against USC, Rackov scored the go-ahead goal to make the score 10-9 with 5:02 remaining in the fourth quarter.
The Trojans, however, quickly notched the equalizer and forced overtime where they won 12-10, thus earning the “three-peat.”
Every qualified California student should get a place in University of California system. That’s a desirable goal for a public university. However, UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert Birgeneau displaces Californians qualified for education at Cal. with $50,600 tuition Foreigners.
UC tuition increases exceed the national average rate of increase. The University of California Board Of Regents jeopardizes Californians attending higher education by making UC the most expensive public university in the United States.
Self-serving tuition increases are used by UC President Mark Yudof to increase the pay of 80,000 eligible faculty and others. Payoffs like these point to higher operating costs and still higher tuition for Californians.
I agree that faculty in higher education and senior management, like Yudof and Birgeneau, should consider the students’ welfare and put it high on their values.
Deeds unfortunately do not bear out the students’ welfare values of senior management and the UC Board of Regents.

Maxi skirts have taken the fashion world by storm. They can be pleated. They can be voluminous. They can be skintight. They all have one thing in common: They pack a big punch when it comes to making a statement.
Several seasons ago, the maxi dress made a comeback: a comfortable and stylish one-piece wonder. This season few trends have made such a splash on retail racks and style blogs as the maxi skirt has. This season has, and continues to be, about lengths ranging from ankle grazing to floor length in jersey and chiffon materials.
Ellen Noh, a senior majoring in communication who runs USC’s street style blog, “Style SC,” said the style has made a transition from laid back to high fashion recently.
“California has already embraced maxi skirts as a beach staple, but it hasn’t caught on as much in other places,” Noh said. “But in last spring, maxi skirts exploded all over runways of designers like Lanvin, Jason Wu, Michael Kors; now the maxi skirt isn’t just a beach outfit option anymore.”
Brightly colored skirts in green, orange or pink can be paired with a top of a different, but equally bright hue to create a colorblocking effect, whereas neutral tones can be worn with just about anything to create a neutral or contrasting look. Fearless fashion plates can try to incorporate other trends to take things up a notch.
You can also try a polka dot print, which can be small or large in any color.  This look is all about the unconventional, so go for mixing textures and/or colors when putting it together. For instance, a dark gray jersey skirt can be paired with a loose silk tank top and shoes of your choice.
A top paired with these skirts isn’t too heavy or big. The maxi skirt is a big silhouette for the bottom of your outfit. If you are big on the top and on the bottom, you will clutter your outfit with fabric.
Noh suggests opting for a skirt with a defined waistline or creating an hourglass silhouette by adding a belt.
The versatility of the piece is what makes it so appealing. It can be worn during the daytime with leather sandals, or at night with a pair of platform heels and a jacket. Leather and denim jackets work particularly well with any style maxi skirt and add just a touch of edge to the outfit.
To really maximize wardrobe wearability, a gathered skirt with an elastic waistband can be worn as a dress and cinched at the waist for a classic mid-calf length look reminiscent of the 1950s.
Invest in one and you can wear it into the fall, as well. Try pairing a light, flowy skirt with a rougher pair of combat boots and a chunky sweater to take a spring look into the colder months. Loose, cable knit sweaters (think of that cozy sweater from your grandfather’s closet, but updated) can keep you warm and looks snug juxtaposed with an airier bottom piece. Leather boots can be found in a variety of styles: lace-up, platform, suede, leather and peep-toe.
It all depends on how edgy you want to get.
Since it is such a strong and noticeable trend, it might not stick around long enough for it to be a worthwhile investment.
Instead of splurging on a designer item, go for either an inexpensive or mid-priced brand that you trust will last for the next couple of seasons.
Bottom line? When it comes to the maxi skirt, there is no one way to wear it.
Why did you interview the author of Style SC? That blog hasn’t been updated since last May. Hardly a source.

When former Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs died last week, the nation wasted no time in mourning the loss of the renowned innovator.
Perhaps more interesting, however, was how members of the video game industry responded to the incident, and described the significance of Jobs’ impact on the gaming sector.
According to an article in USA Today, several video game companies lauded the life and legacy of Jobs, calling him a “leading light,” an “inspiration” and “one of a kind.”
One reporter from CNET named Jobs an “accidental video games visionary” for contributing to the marketing of popular mobile games on iPhones and iPads.
These comments on Jobs’ impact exemplify how far the video game industry has come in its abilities to adapt to a generation of on-the-go technology.
By 2014, the industry is projected to exceed $11.4 billion. In other words, in a span of just five years, the mobile game industry is expected to nearly double its profits.
The idea of playing video games on mobile devices and smartphones didn’t gain widespread popularity until the introduction of Apple’s iPhone in 2007. Through a collection of cheap, creative and high-quality games, the iPhone quickly became a target for casual and seasoned gamers, while Jobs became instantly intertwined with the success of a new field.
In the four years since the iPhone’s creation, the gaming industry has revolutionized itself by establishing a powerful presence in mobile-device technology. This year the mobile game industry will make an estimated $8 billion in revenue, up a substantial 33 percent from 2009.
Some of the biggest draws are these games’ prices — or lack thereof. In July, 51 percent of the 25 best-selling mobile games in the App store are completely free, while 27 percent are just $0.99.
Most of this trend has to do with a combination of the state of the economy and the mass market of casual gamers. For most working adults, smartphones are a necessity for managing hectic lifestyles. According to a 2011 study conducted by Geekaphone, 37 percent of iPhone owners play games on a daily basis and 84 percent of tablet owners play games in general. Basically, a majority of mobile device owners use their devices to play games, and most of these people are in their late 20s to early 40s. Therefore, these people are looking for games that require little skill and little money, but still offer fun and convenient temporary refuges.
These downloadable games are being sold through the ever-increasingly popular freemium strategy, which allows users to download games free of charge but requires them to make in-game purchases for additional features. Traditionally, downloadable games followed a “pay-per-download” format, in which consumers purchased and downloaded games in their entirety at typically higher prices. Games following the new “freemium” formula are expected to surpass the number of traditional pay-per-download offers by 2013, which could affect the way consumers purchase video games in the mobile and traditional console markets.
Without a doubt, the gaming industry is evolving. And unsurprisingly, some are worried that as we enter this digital age, traditional video games will begin to disappear.
Though these statistics highlight a flourishing mobile gaming market, they don’t necessarily mean an end to the traditional gaming market.
Video game sales have not declined with the rise of mobile games. In fact, despite the increased number of digital downloads, the desire to own hard copies and cartridges remains fairly consistent among gamers. With Sony’s upcoming PlayStation Vita handheld console, the company opted out of a digital-only device so as not to alienate the traditional gamers, who still have a penchant for hard copies.
“Some consumers like shopping in retail stores, talking to knowledgeable store clerks, buying and playing games on the spot. We do not want to remove that capability from consumers,” said Shuhei Yoshida, Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios president, in an interview with Edge.
There is clearly a kinesthetic and humanistic factor that people enjoy. Traditional video games encourage socialization through shared television screens and close company, whereas mobile devices focus more on independent gaming and anonymous online interaction.
Though the mobile gaming market is expanding at an impressive rate in part because of Jobs’ vision for technology, this unique branch of the gaming industry is not about to squelch the more traditional market any time soon. On the contrary, mobile games have defined an entirely new set of gamers that can easily oscillate between traditional and digital-age video games.
Even without Jobs’ powerful presence, the Apple visionary has used the appeal of mobile technology to establish a broader group of gamers, which continues to revolutionize the market and can only encourage the video game industry to create even better products.

The Irish folk-punk band Dropkick Murphys did not get their name from a rehab center in Connecticut, contrary to popular belief.
According to Matt Kelly, current drummer of the revolutionary band, former guitarist Marc Orrell was drunk when he made the claim, and it just stuck with fans.
The name, Kelly claims, came from John Murphy, a professional wrestler in Massachusetts.
“[Murphy] was known for his dropkick, ended up coaching boxing and found himself dealing with a lot of boxers who had drinking problems,” Kelly said. “This was back in the early days of [Alcoholics Anonymous], and he basically opened his home up to drunks as a place to dry out.”
Murphy was one of those typical Bostonians: He carried, with extreme pride, his Irish roots as well as an unfaltering loyalty for his home state of Massachusetts — much like the Dropkick Murphys.
Founded in 1996, the Dropkick Murphys have flown under the radar for years but have developed a small, loyal fan base attracted to its intriguing mix of Irish folk and punk, making the band one of the more popular American bands today.
The band members believe it’s vital to keep the tradition of folk music alive.
“Traditional music is important,” Kelly said. “[Folk] shows where we come from. Punk has only been around since the ’60s but folk has always been there — it’s the voice of the people and you never want to silence that.”
Kelly also wants to make clear that this isn’t your grandmother’s favorite band.
“We’re a punk-rock band — almost a gateway band for a lot of kids to find more obscure bands and also traditional music,” Kelly said. “We can turn our fans onto something from their neck of the woods and reconnect them with that.”
What’s interesting about the band is that not every song is an equal mix of folk and punk. On any of its seven albums, it’s easy to hear the songs feature dramatically different styles.
“There’s a bit of variety,” Kelly said. “There’ll be straight up old-style hardcore on there, but then also have a folksy-sounding tune. We don’t have a homogenous sound. We’re not bashing people over the head with folk and punk; it’s just how we write tunes.”
The band’s particular writing style has enabled it to consistently sell out arenas even after 15 years on the stage. Success, however, took some rearranging and time.
“It was hard in the beginning, trying to get guys to play in a punk rock band on tour in a small parochial town in Massachusetts,” Kelly said. “So we went through a few guys throughout the years and it took a while for the sound to evolve.”
Once the band found its sound, the Dropkick Murphys found a place in listeners’ hearts. And even though their music seems tailor-made for the boast-of-their-roots Irish in Massachusetts, most of Dropkick Murphys’ fanbase comes from outside of the members’ home state.
“People weren’t aware of what we were doing in our own backyard,” Kelly said. “We’d play in front of thousands in Germany but most people back home had no idea who we were. It was sort of a secret club.”
At long last the change came. In a state obsessed with Red Sox baseball, all it took was the team to start using the song “Tessie” during games — and like that, the band’s popularity surged.
And it certainly didn’t hurt that the song “I’m Shipping Up To Boston” was used in the award-winning film The Departed.
Though the band found major success in its hometown, the group didn’t let fame get to its head.
“We’ve seen a lot of bands come and go and do something like The Departed and skyrocket into the mainstream and alienate their fans,” Kelly said. “We’re very aware and appreciative of our fans. We’re not about the easy buck or the easy fame. It’s about our fans.”
And those fans have been with the band for 15 years — and hopefully 15 more to come.
“In 15 years, we’ll probably be in wheelchairs. We’ll still be doing it because we love doing this,” Kelly said. “Between all us guys, we probably have 700 more songs and riffs we need an outlet for. It’s the best job in the world. And we’re going to do it until people are sick of us.”
The Dropkick Murphys will perform at the Hollywood Palladium on Saturday.

A haunting portrayal of hardball politics hit theaters Friday with George Clooney’s latest film The Ides of March. The film captures the true complexities of campaign life through a slick staffer, Stephen Myers (Ryan Gosling), working on a presidential campaign for Democratic Gov. Mike Morris (George Clooney).
Loathing on the campaign trail · Stephen Myers (Ryan Gosling, far right) takes the media and the campaign by storm in George Clooney’s latest film The Ides of March, using strategic gumption and gall. - Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures Publicity
Stephen is young and bold. People love him even when they hate him.  Despite his charming and idealistic character, he falls into the temptations of power and a desire to win.
Screenwriters Beau Willimon, Grant Hezlov and George Clooney ingeniously crafted a plot exposing the simple truth: Not all is fair in love and politics.
Power relations start from the very bottom, deals are made on every level and lives are ruined when the truth gets out.
To add more credibility, Willimon claims the fictional Stephen is loosely based on Willimon’s friend, political strategist and former USC adjunct professor Jay Carson, who worked on Howard Dean’s 2004 presidential campaign.
Though Carson admits to inspiring the basis for Stephen’s character, he points out the character is supposed to represent the ethical, moral and political choices politicians and staffers must face on the road.
“Usually political campaign [films have] a good guy and a bad guy, and they are fighting with each other and the good guy wins,” Carson said. “That’s not how the real world works. That’s what [the writers] do really well, understanding that politics, like most things, isn’t binary.”
Clooney, Heslov and Willimon craft a dynamic screenplay, one that uses witty dialogue and fluid segues, lending the film its quick and engaging pace — mirroring the rhythms and stresses of the electoral process.
In the film, Stephen, like Carson, begins to understand how the game is played. As the narrative progresses, he is dirtied from the mess around him.
“Whenever you are dealing with something where there is as much at stake as there is on a presidential campaign, it’s going to get very tense and there will be very big pressure, and a lot of the decisions that you make have enormous consequences,” Carson said.  “Sometimes the ends justify the means with the decisions that you have to make.”
The Ides of March feels like a movie saturated in melodrama, but the dark bartering that occurs between opposing sides mixed with the film’s semi-juvenile dialogue ultimately entices.
A cast of star-studded actors further bolsters the film’s verity, including actors such as Paul Giamatti, Evan Rachel Wood and Jeffrey Wright.
Giamatti, who plays the GOP senior political adviser, outstandingly portrays the ruthless face of Morris’ competition. Giamatti is one of the film’s catalysts and renders more deviousness to accompany the film’s overarching themes of mistrust and betrayal.
In one instance, Giamatti offers Myers a shady deal. Stephen must decide between loyalty and curiosity and he chooses the latter. For Stephen’s boss, Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), loyalty is all that matters. After a surprising confrontation, Stephen is faced with yet another difficult decision: remain loyal or bring everyone down with him.
The over-dramatized plot development is supposed to paint a picture of the cutthroat world in which politicians and staffers interact, but in the end, Hollywood’s fictitious, dramatic ideals win over reality.
“None of that stuff ever happened to me,” Carson said.  “That is Hollywood taking things to another level because in truth compressing what really happens on a campaign into a movie is impossible. Campaigns last 18 months; [the film] takes place over seven days.”
Carson’s claim is noticeable in the film. At times, Stephen and Paul seem like farfetched caricatures of political strategists and The New York Times journalist Ida (Marisa Tomei) is depicted as a ruthless, stab-you-in-the-back type of reporter.
There are noticeable, albeit minor, flaws in the film that might make it hard for viewers uninterested in politics to sit through all 101 minutes.
The film features awkward drama and misplaced aesthetic ploys. Scenes of seductive, barely legal interns and long walks to offices, restaurants and hotels make it feel like Clooney, as a director, is trying too hard.
The cinematography, courtesy of Phedon Papamichael, is engaging for the most part — stunningly capturing physiognomy-centered close-ups that flesh out the movie’s more human themes of cutthroat competition and survival of the fittest — some scenes, however, are unnecessary and even fail to evoke pathos.
In one scene, Stephen sits in his car temporarily mourning an intern’s tragic suicide. Raindrops drape his windshield and fall like tributaries onto his face, making it look like he’s crying — the scene is not dramatic and is rather distracting when considering the overall direction of the film.
The film ultimately redeems itself of its minor flaws. The drama and cinematography are held together by hypnotic segues that utilize voiceovers and the movie’s soundtrack.
In the end, The Ides of March will leave viewers with a new look at the dog-eat-dog world of politics. The moral of the story: Democratic and Republican nominees are not the only politicians — do not underestimate the staffers; they are the men and women who really run Washington.
Despite all shady deals, the high pressure and the double-dealings, Carson said he still believes in the system.
“It’s a tough business,” Carson said. “It can be an unforgiving business, but ultimately I think we have the best system of government in the world and there is more opportunity, there is more equality and there is more freedom for individuals.”

Now into its third week, the Occupy Wall Street movement is still attacked by critics and dismissed by many, despite its important message and growing support. People, particularly those in the top 1 percent of the tax bracket, have been critical of the movement’s apparent lack of organization and failure to create a concrete list of demands. But these criticisms are ignorant and presumptuous.
The movement isn’t going for simple solutions because the country is facing a complex problem. They are trying to draw attention and increase political discussion regarding the plight of the 99 percent.
The protesters are well organized, considering the campaign is international in scope. In the New York City protests, for example, activists have set up multiple committees to spread the message and address key goals.
Every day there is a general assembly, where protestors plan their next move and help focus the groups’ ideas. To organize the different groups around the country, an active social networking group is hard at work, using Twitter hashtags, sharing videos and setting up websites to explain what the movement is about.
And it is about something. The protesters have embraced the motto: “We are the 99 percent,” a unifying call to attention that aside from the top 1 percent of the population, the entire country was hurt by and still suffers from the recession.
Occupy Wall Street and its associated movements are protesting against the low taxes on the rich compared to the rest of the population and cuts to public education. There isn’t a list of people to elect, or a list of anti- or pro-government demands and there doesn’t need to be one.
The protests ask: How can those who are deeply involved in Wall Street and who pump large amounts of money into Washington, D.C., be allowed to dictate the action while jobs and important social programs suffer?
That’s what is most important to college students. Continued education cuts forced many public universities to raise tuition. The student protests in 2009 regarding rising costs were an early sign of discontent.
Many of the stories on the “We are the 99 percent” Occupy Wall Street website deal with students struggling to afford college or who are in heavy debt with no job opportunities upon graduation.
What’s more, the movement, unlike many of its contemporary protests, is organized in a way that gives it a strong chance to get its message out to voters and lawmakers.
The methods, borrowed from the revolutionaries in Tunisia and Egypt in the spring, are forms of non-violent protest. Activists in New York, Los Angeles and other cities actively make sure others do not grow aggressive toward the police, so as to not face any police force or arrests, though that tactic hasn’t exactly worked.
The framing message — an all-inclusive, nonpartisan movement for the people against corporate influence in politics — allows for the Occupy Wall Street movement to draw in people of any age and political affiliation.
Students are playing a major role in the protests, but everyone from World War II veterans to former Wall Street workers have joined. It’s this kind of strategy of gathering the masses that helped past protesters, from Gandhi to Martin Luther King Jr., succeed.
And maybe this is what the country needs. Not a violent revolution, not a regime change, but a social justice campaign that can get people involved with American politics again.
This year people, especially those our own age, are showing they can make a difference by voicing their opinions.
At this point, it’s not clear whether the Occupy Wall Street movement will bring about monumental change, but it needs time. What is clear is the movement is growing, and its message is universal.
Occupy Wall Street begat Occupy Los Angeles and other solidarity movements, all with the same goal of an honest democratic process and a focus on things that matter, such as education. Is there really anything bad about that?
It’s time to occupy.

I won’t be surprised if the author pens another marxist missive about how USC should’ve allowed Kal to score a few more points in Thursday nights’ game “out of fairness.” I mean, the state of CA pays the Bears’ tuition, and they practice so hard; don’t they deserve a few automatic touchdowns?
I’m a finance major, hence I know everything there is to about Wall Street. Here, let me impress you with my finance jargon: IPO, splits, roadshows, options, buyback, NPV, P/E ratio, yield, etc. All you hippies who worship Steve Jobs are idiots. You have no idea how avaricious Apple Corp. really is, and how it is the postercompany for capitalism–the thing you vilify–stop buying Macbooks if you tools hate those “greedy fatcats” on WS.
We are the 99 percent – people that do not protest.
25% of the population votes in elections. 
Corporations supply nearly everything that is consumed or produced. Every non-profit is a corporation and nearly every church is a corporation. Corporations are so fully ingrained into our society that to outlaw corporations or corporate profit is to end the United States of America. No thank you. 
Our president has made it clear that he thinks there is a certain amount of income that is enough. So when the millionaires and billionaires decide they have enough and their incomes drop to $30,000 a year, who will pay the taxes for all the programs and the salaries of the White House Czars?
47% of the population already get some sort of government assistance. Tuition, food stamps, Social Security, research grants, tax credits, rent assistance, WIC, job training, … We are the government; we are the welfare recipients; we pay the taxes. It would be cheaper and more efficient for each person to be responsible and self-welfare.
The ignorance of the OWS protesters can be summed up in their overwhelmingly supportive comments regarding Steve Jobs after his death. These people profess deep admiration and love for the late Mr. Jobs and his company Apple Corp., despite their protests being centered around four key complaints:
1) Corporations are too big (Apple is the world’s LARGEST corporation, with a market cap of $337 billion).
2) Corporations are hoarding money (Apple currently has $76 billion of un-invested cash reserves on its balance sheet)
3) Corporate executives are too wealthy (Steve Jobs’ personal fortune was over $7 billion at the time of his death)
4) Corporations spend too much money influencing elections with no transparency (Apple has spent millions of dollars on political contributions over the last 20 years, but does not disclose the recipients or line-item amounts on its company 10K).
Not to mention the fact that their entire protest movement has been organized with corporate-made mobile devices using corporate-invented technology transmitted over corporate-run data networks. 
Until the OWS people develop a consistent and informed platform, and understand the necessary and beneficial role that corporations play in their lives, they are just a bunch of clueless soapbox-yellers and cannot be taken seriously. The OWS protesters are no different than the thousands of Tea Party idiots who screamed about socialism and government spending while living off Social Security and Medicare checks. Like them, the OWS crowd have no understanding of what they personally stand to lose if their demands are actually met.
Dear author,
Please do not use names like Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi unless you understand what was their “strategy” and how its not being used in this case.
Sad to see young people being mislead into believing there’s a substitute to hard work. The environment for jobs and education is bad, and rightly so because of wrong decisions by a few, but if you can’t make lemon juice out of lemons then you will always keep calling yourself “the other 99%”. Not to offend anyone who works their heart out just to live by paycheck to paycheck, but people do have wrong inclinations and understanding of what is “bare minimum” in this country. 
m d, I feel sad for you and pray you have more resilience and patience.
Workerbee, Rich, Chris, happy for all of you, you do have your mind at the right place.
Is this the Daily Trojan or The Daily Californian (Kal’s student paper)?
MD, where can I get what you’re smoking? I need to take a break from reality and engage in some relavativistic thought. 
 I would add more to this discussion but Chris and Worker Bee have already summarized my thoughts. 
Fight on and beat the commies!
Ah, the age-old plight of the haves vs the haves-not.  It is really catchy to pit 1% vs 99%, but the fact of the matter is the vast majority of Americans are gainfully employed.  One can slice and dice statistics any which way he wants in order to make a point, but it doesn’t mean much in the end.  America is still a democracy and will continue to promote capitalism since it works for 99% of the hard working, freedom loving people who value such ideals.  The remaining 1% can march all day long in the hopes of getting more free handouts while the rest of us work to pay for them.
Would you please not share you ignorance of facts so blatantly!  1 in 4 American receive ‘entitlements’ that works out to 77+ MILLION american’s BELOW THE POVERTY LINE!!!!  Where are those 99% of workers AGAIN (since you are math illiterate that works out to 308,359,292 people with nearly 68 MILLION of them less than 18 so you think 68 MILLION children working is legitimate?)  Please pull your proverbial head out of your….  3.1 MILLION people own more wealth than 146 MILLION People.  I just got my paperwork from the Social Security Benefits Administration.  I have paid over $253,000.00 into Social Security in my lifetime. I WILL NEVER SEE A DIME of it!!!!!  Every Man, Woman and Child (including the 1%) legally in the United States owe $44,600 in debt service.  So please pay your share of that $44,600.00 since you are one of the 99% [sic].  I WANT MY SOCIAL SECURITY IN 10 years!!!!
I used the 1% – 99% analogy to make a point, not to show how many people are living in poverty.  Anybody can google the figures.
I, too, am paying into Ponzi schemes, er, entitlement programs, from which I will probably not receive anything close to what I paid over a lifetime.  Social Security and Medicare will surely implode as more and more baby boomers retire.  But they were never designed to be bank accounts.
You say you have three adult “kids” living with you because they can’t find work.  Huh?  Did they go to college?  Did you help them select majors that lead to gainful employment?  Did you encourage them to take internships to gain experience and build a network?  This kind of reminds me of the ant and grasshopper fable.  You failed them as a parent and now they are marching with hippies, communists, and ignorant people who believe they are “entitled” to the same things that hard-working Americans have EARNED.  I can see why you are bitter.
I love reading fantasy writings from students who have never had a real job or raised a family. The issue on jobs is directly related to raising taxes and increasing regulations on small business. 99.99999 % of the ignorant jobless people occupying wall street will never work for wall street, they will work for small business. The current president has small business so scared of what expenses he will stick them with, they will not hire, and they will not expand. Another note, small business depends on wall street for its money to start. That top 1% keeps our jobs and money coming in. Still not sure what those unwashed dirty unemployed people really want wall street to do….start handing out free cash? Also love all the pro socialistic and communism signs…pretty sure we can guess what they want.
Rich,
  I have had a real job for more than 30 years and have 3 kids which I am still raising because they can’t get jobs.  The ‘Occupiers’ have got my family’s own interests at heart! The reporter of this article is simply reciting what is already known.  Anyone who makes more than $349,000.00/yr (according to the 2010 census) is in the 1%.  The 1% own more than 48.9% of all the wealth in the United States (according to the 2010 census).  That IS AN UNHEALTHY STATISTIC!!!  When I graduated USC I had close to $30,000.00 in student loans which I was able to pay off in 6 years. I was able to pay them off because of the high quality job in computer programming when I graduated.  Today, those jobs are now in India/China and don’t exist here (Apple DOES NOT BUILD a single iMac/iPod/iPhone/iPad or anything else in the USA and the majority of their INCOME IS IN BANKS OVERSEAS!!!!!!!). Businesses convinced Congress to increase the H1B visa limits to bring in cheap workers, who incidentally, took those jobs with them when they left.  I will agree with you that the regulations of ALL BUSINESSES are hurting everyone however, those regulations were unnecessary when businesses were driven by common sense and fair play rather than greed (e.g. Enron, Worldcom, State of California, State of Illinois, Lehman Brothers).  The people on Wall-Street are the same sort of people that rioted for Civil-Rights and ending the war in Vietnam.  The only difference is they haven’t been pushed into violence yet.  When the violence starts; the 1% and their backers (indirectly meaning you Rich) better watch yourselves.  The states are so broke right now they can’t afford to hire or pay overtime for those police you will be calling to come and protect you.  That is the real worry, the lack of law enforcement when all the states and governments finally go broke.  I would recommend that all people who read this and similar articles visit the website ‘getmoneyout’ dot ‘com’.  This would begin the steps (it isn’t the solution!) to get this US of A on the right path again.
m d,
That’s a nice sentiment; i particularly enjoyed the part where you threaten “rich” people with violence.  The good news is, that since the people who support this are a teeny tiny minority of the far left, we (the responsible productive members of society) have nothing to fear since we happen to actively support the 2nd Amendment while they do not.

You ride your bicycle all the way to class, but find the bike rack filled to capacity. You lock your back wheel in place and leave the bike near the rack so you can rush to class. When you come back out, your bike is gone.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
 
After dejectedly walking home thinking your bike has been stolen, you find an email waiting for you saying your bike has been impounded by the Dept. of Public Safety. You must pay $20 to retrieve your bicycle or it will be sold or given to charity after 90 days.
This doesn’t sound like the type of activity in which a department dedicated to the university’s safety should engage. It is an inefficient attempt to fight the symptoms when a cure, such as adding bike racks, for the cause already exists.
This has been occurring for a long time now, and it seems DPS has been ramping up the amount of impounds in recent weeks or is at least trying to publicize the policy more through signs on the doors of the Lyon Center.
But this misguided rule does little for public safety and instead further strains the relationship between DPS and the student body. This policy doesn’t help DPS’ credibility in the minds of students who wonder if the department’s officers would be better served performing tasks that don’t involve charging students for recovering their own property. The policy could lead to further resentment against DPS because students might believe DPS would be better-suited in concentrating its efforts toward crime prevention and reaction, rather than impounding bikes.
The rule is in place to keep the amount of bike thefts down. It approaches the problem, however, from the wrong angle. The vast majority of these floating bicycles are not there by fault of the owner, but because of a lack of available bike rack space.
Places with a high volume of daily bike traffic, such as the Lyon Center or Leavey Library, are ill-equipped with available parking space. This causes that all-too-familiar congregation of spokes, pedals and handlebars in the way of the door. It leaves us one unfortunate pant-leg-snag away from disaster. Instead of fighting this problem with more bike racks, the university attempts to fight it with more ill-advised solutions by taking bikes away.
Yes, DPS uses discretion in the enforcement of this rule — you are not going to find officers enforcing it outside of Taper Hall during the height of class hours. And because of this good judgment, the rule seems inconsistent. Ambiguity rears its ugly head when the rule is enforced and the affected students are generally unfamiliar with the policy.
The department exists to ensure the safety of members of the USC community, most importantly its students. DPS can only help itself by focusing on more worthwhile endeavors.
Yes, the overflow of bikes needs to be addressed for the safety of the students. This shouldn’t be done through the folderol of impounding bikes. Rather, increasing the number of available bike racks so that high-traffic buildings like Taper Hall and the Lyon Center can handle the surplus would be a much more elegant and practical solution.

I have to say that I agree with SC Trojan. I do think that a big problem on campus is the lack of bike racks. Btu the larger problem are the students that park their bikes in front of an entrance blocking people from coming in and out. The students that lock their bikes to handicap ramps so those in wheel chairs cant get into the building. (I personally call DPS to remove those bikes)  There would not be a bike problem if people would just park their bikes in an orderly fashion. I walk in front of the Lyon Center and there are bikes that are parked in the middle of the walk way.  Then I look at Webb and Flour and there are plenty of bike space. How about putting them near the bike racks at least even though there full. I would agree with a parking lot for just bikes. But I think students would still park them so messed up that they would end up closing it down anyway.  I personally would like to think DPS for impounding the bikes, maybe the students will get a clue in parking them correctly. Oh and I called DPS about the issue and they told me they don’t impound just because they are not locked to a bike rack  THEY IMPOUND THE ONES THAT ARE BLOCKING WALKWAYS AND ENTRANCE!! AS THEY SHOULD!!  ALSO, I would rather get my bike impounded by DPS and pay $20 bucks for being in the way of my fellow students rather then getting it stolen by a criminal and have to pay another $200 bucks for a new bike!!
As a parent touring the campus (different perspective than a student) with my prospective freshman last year, I was postively impressed with the number of bikes on campus (energy efficient, inexpensive transportation, excellent exercise) and negatively impressed with the university’s feeble attempt to provide adequate bike rack space.  Adequate bike racks are not a huge expense, nor do they require maintenance.  The campus doesn’t truly have a shortage of acreage on which to install racks either.  With the amount of money that students pay in tuition a few extra racks outside key facilities like dorms and major classrooms does not seem like a huge burden, especially when you compare it to the labor and overhead involved in impounding bikes, recovering stolen bikes etc.  Nothing will completely prevent theft in an urban environment, but creating a safer environment less tempting to thieves seems like the logical way to cut down on DPS man hours and the aggravation of stolen property.
If the university wishes to impress the parents of incoming freshman – providing bike racks seems like a pretty cheap alternative.
While I agree there aren’t enough bike racks to accommodate the hordes of bikes on campus, it is also ridiculous that people have to maneuver around the bikes that are left outside of buildings in an disorderly fashion or locked along a handrail but blocking an entrance to a building.  On a campus overrun with bikes, perhaps a better solution is to consider creating bike “parking lots”.  If there are those who drive to campus have to park their cars at a lot and walk on campus, those on bikes should have a similar responsibility.

Be sure to Take Care of the 10 dollars in your pocket that you were going to spend on the new Drizzy album in a few weeks. You can Thank Drake Later for the postponement of his new album, which was originally due out on his birthday, Oct. 24.
Don’t get up in arms about it though. Drake provided legitimate reasons for the delay of the release, and its all legalities no one wants to get into.
There are three samples on different tracks on Take Care that need to be “cleared,” and it seems the rights to these samples won’t be passed by the Oct. 24 deadline.
Its not some copout that he isn’t done with the album yet, either. Drake wrote on his website that he “completed 19 songs (17 on physical and 2 on bonus),” so the album is ready in its entirety.
“My options were to take the songs off and make the birthday release happen, or to take an extra couple weeks to get the paper work right and give you the album the way I NEED you to hear it,” the rapper wrote.
Apparently, Drake took no time in deciding that the tracks were worth the wait. He wants his fans to “get Take Care the exact way I created it with no trimmings.” The pushed back release date will also cause his Club Paradise Tour to be moved after winter break. Ultimately, most students will be able to go — and more will have the excess Christmas cash to splurge.
Drake has already set the bar high for his new record with “Headlines,” the lead single off of Take Care. So far, he’s lived up to the hits that came on Thank Me Later and his EP, So Far Gone.

The city of Pasadena is making progress in the world of eco-friendly consumerism with a ban that will require grocers, convenience stores and other vendors to stop offering plastic bags and instead charge 10 cents for every paper bag.
There will be no charge to customers who bring their own reusable bags or for those who pay with food stamps or Women, Infant and Children stamps.
The ban is still in its early stages, as officials unanimously approved a movement to draft an ordinance within the next 60 days. After the submission of the ordinance, the City Council will vote on the ban. The proposed change comes on the heels of Los Angeles County’s plastic bag ban, which was passed in November of 2010.
Members of the city council are optimistic as to how the ban will be accepted by citizens. Public opinion favors the eco-friendly movement, and many consumers already bring their own reusable bags to grocery stores. Clothing stores, restaurants and other establishments may be included in the ban in the future.
“We did not include clothing stores and restaurants because the largest distribution happens at food and grocery stores,” said Pasadena sustainability affairs manager Ursula Schmidt in the Los Angeles Times.
Several types of establishments — such as restaurants and stores that sell raw meat — will still be allowed to use plastic bags due to fear of contamination. For other stores, however, violations will incur a warning, and further transgressions will result in fines.
