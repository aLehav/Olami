A first-generation USC alumnus is inspiring students from the South Los Angeles area to aim for a brighter future by taking them on a tour of USC and its surrounding neighborhoods.
Arthur Argomaniz, who graduated from the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, created this program to help students who share his background.
These students only live within a few miles of campus, but most of them have never stepped inside. Through this tour, they will get a chance to see that others from similar backgrounds have been able to not only make it through college, but excel and do powerful work to support disadvantaged youth in their pursuit toward higher education. 
“I always jump at the opportunity to work with young people, especially those young people of color living in communities with high levels of violence, gang activity, low educational attainment, high drug and alcohol abuse,” Argomaniz said. “I do this because we never know when that moment of clarity might spark a young person’s mind and propel them forward in life. The type of moment where people realize there is a whole world of possibilities out there.”
As a high school student, Argomaniz was in a similar situation. He started working as a 15-year-old, and school initially wasn’t a priority for him, even though he performed well academically. Upon graduating from high school, he began working full-time while attending community college in order to ensure that he did not have to work manual labor jobs like he saw many people around him doing. Then, at 21, his daughter was born, which led him to realize that his life had become bigger than just him. 
“I had one counselor at community college that kept telling me I had good enough grades to go to college, but I always pushed back saying I couldn’t afford it,” Argomaniz said. “With her support and many conversations, I was able to see the big picture. Investing in myself now would mean bigger and better things for me in the long run.”
Despite these difficulties, Argomaniz was able to develop a supportive network that offered him guidance and support at USC.
“I struggled until I started creating a circle of friends and professors that would change my life,” Argomaniz said.
The volunteers have arranged for a group of graduate and undergraduate students, alumni, professors, administrators from the cultural student centers and staff from local community based organizations to come and share parts of their own journeys and experiences at USC. They will end the day with a dinner followed by a closing reflection. 
Argomaniz shared what he believes is going to be the most important part of this tour. 
“We hope that the [visiting students] see themselves in the shoes of these USC students, that they understand with hard work and determination they can achieve any goal they set in life,” Argomaniz said.

Photo courtesy of Yaminah McKesseyToward Trump · Professor Bob Shrum (left) and Southern California News Group editor Brian Calle (right) spoke on Trump’s politics Tuesday.
A journalist and a USC professor discussed the possibility of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump winning the presidential election at “Why Donald Trump Shouldn’t Win — and Will,” hosted by the Department of Political Science in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences at the Von KleinSmid Center Tuesday. 
Bob Shrum, a professor of political science, spoke with Brian Calle, the editor-in-chief of CalWatchDog.com, the opinion editor for the Southern California News Group and a professor at Chapman University. 
The two discussed Trump’s persona, his appeal to different voting blocs and why a Trump presidency would not necessarily have a positive impact on the country.
When discussing Trump’s favorability in Rust Belt states due to his blue-collar pro-protectionist and pro-middle class rhetoric, Calle said that these areas, combined with a handful of swing states, is enough to secure a Trump presidency, much like the populist public opinion that elected the new Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte and passed the Brexit vote. Calle highlighted social pressure as the cause leading individuals to state something differently in the polls and in public than they do in the voting booth.
Calle noted that this election points toward an irrelevance in debate outcomes. He alluded to his belief that who won and who lost the debate will have little effect on the way Americans will vote come Election Day. Calle also recalled the limited effect Republican candidate Mitt Romney’s debate victories had on the direction of the last presidential election. 
“If we remember back to 2012, everyone said Romney destroyed Obama in the first debate, and over and over I kept saying, ‘it doesn’t matter if Romney wins all three debates, it’s not going to move the electorate,’” Calle said. “I think this first debate confirmed people who already support Trump are going to continue to support Trump, and for people who are supporting Hillary, they are going to continue to support Hillary.”
Calle said, however, that Trump’s popularity may not be measured accurately, as in many more Democratic-leaning states Trump supporters feel pressure to not voice their opinions. 
“I think the polls are a little bit skewed nationwide, but particularly in more competitive states,” Calle said. “I meet with incredibly smart and successful people, be it CEOs, some of my students at Chapman, professors, a couple of university presidents. All of them will say publicly ‘I’m not voting for Donald Trump’ and privately will vote for Trump.”
Calle, who calls himself a “free-market enthusiast,” voiced his concerns for the future of the Republican Party given its conservative social leanings and its inability to keep up with modern times. 
“My last name is Calle — I’m half-Latino,” Calle said. “My longest-standing relationship was with a Muslim. So if Donald Trump were elected president, and we take him with his word, he would send me back to Mexico and put my ex in jail.”
For Calle, the U.S. is in need of a president who will unite opposing sectors of society — but he does not believe either Clinton or Trump is it.
“I don’t think Hillary Clinton is by any means at all a uniting force, and I certainly don’t think that Donald Trump is [either],” Calle said. “A Trump presidency emboldens fringe elements of America in a way that would be dangerous, especially when we already see racial tensions bubble.”
Alexandra Kincade, a junior majoring in political science, said that the conversation on Trump stayed objective even though it was led by someone within the Republican Party.
“It is interesting to know that someone doesn’t necessarily support [Donald Trump] and still thinks that there is a decent possibility that he would get elected,” Kincade said.

Florence Hui | Daily TrojanRunning mate rivalry · Panelists Bob Shrum (left), Tiffany Hoss (center) and Matt Klink (right) spoke before and after the Vice Presidential Debate Tuesday to discuss the candidates’ positions and performance at the debate.
Students gathered to watch the first and only vice presidential debate screening and panel hosted by the Unruh Institute of Politics at Wallis Annenberg Hall Tuesday evening. 
The panel featured former President of USC College Democrats Christina Wilkes, USC Political Science Professor Robert Shrum, President of USC College Republicans Tiffany Hoss and partner at public affairs firm Ek, Sunkin, Klink & Bai Matt Klink. 
Professor Dan Schnur and Daily Trojan Associate Managing Editor Danni Wang moderated the panel.
Prior to the debate, Schnur questioned the panelists about the ways each candidate could succeed in the debate. 
“The stakes are much higher for Mike Pence, and the biggest challenge he has is that he has to give his running mate a hand up from a pretty dismal performance from a week ago,” Klink said. “As long as Tim Kaine continues along the path Hillary Clinton has set up, he will be good.”
For Wilkes, the vice presidential debate was important for the Clinton campaign.
“Tonight is an opportunity for Kaine to serve as a moral authority, because he is well-liked and well-respected, and he can prove to voters that Secretary Clinton is worthy of their votes and their trust,” Wilkes said.   
Schnur started the post-debate panel by affirming the panel’s pre-debate predictions that Trump would dominate the conversation. 
“Tim Kaine did a better job of leveling criticism against Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton did in the presidential debate and Mike Pence did a better job of defending Donald Trump than Donald Trump [himself] did in the presidential debate,” Schnur said. 
He posed the question of whether this focus on the presidential candidates, and Trump in particular, changed the trajectory of the debate. 
Shrum disagreed with this assessment of Pence’s defense of Trump. 
 “I think Pence did a horrible job of defending Donald Trump and he mostly declined to defend Donald Trump,” Shrum said. “The press will generally say he ‘won’ the debate, but I think it was a big test for him to defend Trump and all these things Trump has [said]. I think he failed that test.”
Hoss, in contrast, believed that Pence was able to remain neutral.
“Kaine was the dominant force and he did overpower [Pence] in a lot of ways, as Pence had a lot of opportunities to respond … and he didn’t seize those opportunities,” Hoss said.
The moderators then opened the floor to audience questions. Kira Stiers, a sophomore majoring in political science and international relations, said that Pence was set up for failure because she believed it is very difficult to defend Trump’s statements.
“The campaign clearly made it a strategic decision that they were not going to take the bait of Tim Kaine and try to spend [Pence’s] very scarce debate time responding to charges leveled against him for things that Trump said or allegedly said,” Klink said in response. “What you saw Mike Pence do was what Trump should have done a week ago: instead of talking about the actual question that was asked, respond to the question that you want to answer, and you saw Pence try to paint a stark picture of Hillary Clinton.”
The discussion concluded with a brief look forward at the next presidential debate, which will take place Oct. 9 in the form of a town hall meeting.

The trial of a woman charged with the murder of a USC graduate student continued Tuesday at the Clara S. Foltz Criminal Justice Center downtown. 
Alejandra Guerrero, who was 16 at the time of the murder but is being tried as an adult, is accused of homicide in the case of Xinran Ji, who was murdered when walking home alone near campus on July 24, 2014. Three others have also been accused of the murder and will be tried in November. 
In Tuesday’s court proceedings, Antonio Soria, a security systems administrator at the Department of Public Safety, explained the location of the crime and showed which cameras were surveyed during that time.
A black-and-white video showed the initial contact between the suspects and Ji near 29th St. and Orchard Avenue. In the video, a vehicle pulled up along the curb and turned its lights off. When Ji passed by, three figures jumped out of the car and followed him. After a short altercation, Ji started running first toward Orchard Avenue, but was caught by the suspects and killed.
The prosecution called Odey Ukpo, who has conducted close to 700 autopsies from the Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office, to the stand. Ukpo confirmed that Ji’s death was a homicide caused by blunt force trauma to the head. Graphic images of Ji’s face were then shown, and Ukpo explained the possible causes of each abrasion and contusion found on Ji’s body.
When the defense had the opportunity to cross-examine Ukpo, they argued that he did not conduct the initial check of Ji the night of the murder and that his comments were not completely accurate, as they are based solely on the images the coroner’s office provided him. 
The trial will continue Wednesday as Claudia Rocha, who made the initial report that led to the four teenagers’ arrest the night of the murder, takes the stand as another witness for the prosecution. 
Oksana Trifonova and Miranda Myers contributed to this report.

The Department of Public Safety is assisting the Los Angeles Police Department in investigating multiple robberies that occurred near campus in the early hours of Sunday morning. 
A group of men robbed two USC students, attempted to rob a third and physically assaulted a fourth. Between 1:20 a.m. and 2:35 a.m., the men approached a student near the 3000 block of Figueroa Street and intimidated him into giving up his property. 
They then unsuccessfully tried to rob another student, who was able to alert a nearby security officer. The suspects then attacked and robbed a third student on 28th St. In a final incident, the suspects assaulted a fourth student and fled in a grey SUV Porsche Cayenne. 
Although no robbery occurred in the assault incident, the description of the assailants given by the victim was consistent with the suspects from the previous incidents. 
The first suspect was described as 5’8”, 160-pound black male in his early 20s; the second as a 5’10”, 190-pound black male in his early 20s; the third as a 5’8”, 190-pound, 28-year-old black male; and the fourth as a 5’8”, 170-pound, 23-year-old black male. They were not observed to be carrying weapons. 
The car that they escaped in after the fourth incident was registered to California, bearing the license plate 5TKS145. 
The LAPD requests that anyone with information relevant to the crime notify DPS or the LAPD Southwest Division.

Rocky Mountain high · Junior outside hitter Niki Withers (3) and senior middle blocker Elise Ruddins have been critical players this season, said head coach Mick Haley ahead of a Wednesday match against ASU.
After a successful weekend in the Rocky Mountains against Colorado and Utah, the Trojans face off against ASU Wednesday at the Galen Center in a 7 p.m. match. The No. 22 Women of Troy have regained their winning momentum by beating Colorado and Utah in four and five sets, respectively. 
The Colorado win was the first conference win of the season, proving that the team’s hard work in practice is beginning to show on the court. Senior libero Taylor Whittingham had a great weekend, earning Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week honors.
“We’re such a balanced team right now that we’re spreading it out,” head coach Mick Haley said. “I’m sure we’re tough to deal with because you don’t know where to put your pressure on us.”
Freshman outside hitter Khalia Lanier tallied up 38 kills in both games last weekend, solidifying her dominant role on the team. Junior middle blocker Jordan Dunn, senior middle blocker Elise Ruddins and junior outside hitter Brittany Abercrombie continued to step up as key contributors as the Trojans advance through their season. The reintroduction of Whittingham on the court gave the Trojans a little more experience than they had been working with when she was out. This week, each player will be instrumental in winning against Arizona State on Wednesday and Arizona on Friday.
“We always have a battle with those guys. We’ve played a bunch of five-game matches,” Haley said. “We’ve won most of them, but we’ve lost a couple, and they always play us hard.” 
Arizona State is 7-9 for the season and 0-4 in conference. Key players include senior outside hitter Cassidy Pickrell, who has the most kills on the team, with 16 in their last game against Utah State. Junior middle blocker Oluoma Okaro and senior outside hitter Maya McClendon will also play critical roles when the Sun Devils battle the Women of Troy. Sophomore setter Kylie Pickrell also helps leads the team’s offense. 
The Sun Devils are known for being very athletic, especially the Pickrell Sisters. Both Cassidy Pickrell and McClendon had double doubles against Utah, despite ASU losing in five sets.
“They are as athletic as we are, so I think we’ll see a pretty athletic effort,” Haley said. “Serve and serve receive will be the real key to get control of the game, so we want to focus in that area.”
Serve receive is an area that the team has been working to control this whole season, in order to play better defense in general.
Arizona is 10-6 this year and 2-2 in conference. In their last game against Oregon, a 3-1 loss, redshirt junior middle blocker McKenzie Jacobson led the team with 16 kills. Senior libero Laura Larson had 23 digs, 10 assists and one ace. 
“We usually take one game at a time, so we don’t get ahead of ourselves or get confused because sometimes the game plans are different,” Haley said. 
The team typically focuses solely on the team they have ahead of them, so they will prepare for their matchup against the Wildcats beginning Thursday. This is advantageous for them because they will not be traveling at all this week, and will have ample time to prepare for the two games they have this week.
The Women of Troy will face off against Arizona State Wednesday at 7 p.m. in the Galen Center. The game will be live on Pac-12 Networks. Friday’s game will be another home affair for the Women of Troy as they host the Arizona Wildcats. The game begins at 7 p.m.
The WOT need to win both at home vs. inferior opponents. Maybe that will push them into the top 20 of the polls.
Like to see the MB used more offensively with the best hitting %s on the team at this stage of the season.

Most times when I hear the term “Century Mark” around USC, people are referring to Instagram. You know it’s been a good weekend when your picture from gameday gets more than 100 likes, and you know you’ve made it at the school once you can consistently hit that plateau.
Justin Davis is redefining what it means to have a successful gameday around here, using the same number in a little bit of a different context. The senior tailback racked up 126 yards last week against Utah, then put up 123 on Saturday against Arizona State. It’s still early to say if his emergence as a go-to back will carry through the rest of the season, but his recent success should give Trojans fans a lot to be excited about going into the long stretch of conference play. 
Davis’ senior season began about as poorly as possible for a running back, and was not all too different from the rest of the team’s performance on Week 1. Alabama held Davis to only two yards rushing the entire game, even with seven carries. His receiving numbers that night in Arlington weren’t much better either: two catches for five yards.
Davis’ other test against an elite defense was much improved, though ultimately ending in the same result for the Trojans. He picked up 63 yards on 14 attempts against Stanford, an average of 4.5 per carry, and added another 10 yards via four catches. 
But against Utah State, between the two first losses and in the past two Trojan Pac-12 South battles, Davis has truly been a game changer. His 70 yards on 16 carries — for an average of 4.4 per attempt — against Utah State was very solid. He also added 36 yards on two catches, including a crucial 27 yard gain on a third and 10 that set up USC’s third touchdown just before the half which gave the Trojans a 21-point lead instead of a 14-point lead going into the locker room.
If it would be fair to call any game a “breakout” performance for the senior who was just seven yards short of the 2,000 career rushing yards mark going into Utah, then his performance at Rice-Eccles Stadium would have to hold that distinction. He hit both the “Century Mark” and the “Double Millennium Mark” that game, all within the first half. It took him both halves to get to 100 yards against Arizona State, but on top of the 123 yards he had on the ground, he added another 38 yards in the air, again on only two catches.       
The look at USC’s running back situation gets really interesting when we go back to that second half against Utah. With 102 yards in the first half on six carries, it seemed like Davis was in position to take over the game, build on USC’s one touchdown lead and give the Trojans the crucial victory they needed in the beginning of divisional play. 
However, he got only four additional carries in the second half — without any in the fourth quarter — and added only an additional 24 yards to his total. Of course, the Trojans then let their lead slip late, and many questioned head coach Clay Helton’s usage, or lack thereof, of Davis. 
Because while Davis has been exceptional, sophomore running back Ronald Jones II has had the opposite degree of success this year. 
Jones, the highly touted recruit who was just 13 yards shy of hitting 1,000 yards rushing last year as a freshman, has not taken off in his second season, and is in a very deep sophomore slump. 
Though he did break out a 46 yard run against Alabama in the season opener, he was held to a net total of zero yards on his other six carries against the Crimson Tide. Against Stanford, he had his best output of the season, with 63 yards and one touchdown on 11 carries. But his totals against Utah State and Utah were both abysmal: eight yards on five carries against the former, 15 yards on eight carries against the latter. On Saturday, against ASU, he was only given another five carries, which he took for a passable 20 yards.
It’s hard to believe that RoJo has completely lost it. He appears healthy. The offensive line has been very inconsistent, which is a likely explanation, but that hasn’t stopped Davis from several explosive games. When asked after the Utah game, the only explanation Jones could point to was that maybe he’s lost his mojo since cutting his dreadlocks. 
So I don’t fault Helton and offensive coordinator Tee Martin for trying to keep Jones in the mix. Jones has an exceptionally high ceiling. Allowing Davis to take most of the carries and keep some sort of a rhythm down the stretch probably would make sense, but Helton and Martin should still try to carve out situations for Jones to throw some additional challenges at defenses — and give Davis a chance to catch his breath on some drives. 
Nonetheless, it appears as though the Trojans have finally found their No. 1 quarterback and No. 1 running back. Out wide, junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster is also finally looking like his old self, and the Trojans are reminding fans of all the talent and potential this team came into the season with. 
And the conference title race is still wide open. Arguably more important than USC’s dominating win over ASU was the revelation that Stanford is indeed beatable after being throttled by Washington, and that Utah will now have to win out to climb back on top of the division standings after losing to Cal. If the Trojans can keep up this rhythm on offense, they could still find a way to the Pac-12 championship game.

Photo courtesy of Sports InformationWindy and wild · Senior Gabriella Then was the top scorer (-4) for the women’s golf team at the Windy City Collegiate on Monday and Tuesday.
The No. 3 women’s golf team entered the final round of play at the Windy City Collegiate in Chicago Tuesday in second place (-8) — trailing then-tournament-leading Georgia (-12) by four strokes. 
As a team, USC would collectively shoot 3-over in the final-round Tuesday to finish the tournament third overall with a team score of 5-under.
“We just didn’t get off to the start that we knew we needed to today,” head coach Andrea Gaston said. “The team really did hang in there today, and I was proud of the way they kept themselves in it. Today just wasn’t as good a day for us.”
The team’s top scorer at the tournament was senior Gabriella Then, who finished with an overall score of 4-under after shooting for par in the final round. Then finished the tournament tied for fourth (-4) in the individual standings.
“I just felt like today I played much more consistent overall, and I was getting onto the course more evenly,” Then said. “I was able to take advantage of the birdie holes and opportunities and sticking to the gameplay made things much easier out there for me.”
Senior Karen Chung also recorded a top-10 finish at the Windy City Classic, as she finished ninth overall (-2) after shooting 1-over in the final round.
Golfers played a total of 36 holes in the first two rounds on Monday before the final day of competition on Tuesday. 
“I think that as teams go throughout the second and into the third round, [the ability to play through fatigue] ends up separating the good teams from the bad teams,” Then said. “To be able to stay up near the top was definitely something good for our team.” 
For the second consecutive tournament, sophomore Robyn Ree recorded the top-score in the final-round of play for USC; she shot 1-under on Tuesday. Overall, Ree tied for 16th overall (+1). 
Another USC underclassmen finished in the top-20, as freshman Allisen Corpuz would also tie with Ree for 16th overall (+1) after shooting a 3-over in the final round. 
Redshirt senior Victoria Morgan finished the tournament tied for 32 (+5). 
Senior Elizabeth Doty, who was playing in the tournament individually, tied for 64 (+13).
Following the third place finish in Chicago this week, the Women of Troy now look onward to the Stanford Intercollegiate, which will be played Oct. 14-16 in Stanford, California. The tournament will be held at the Stanford Golf Course.

Photo courtesy of HBOA different world · Evan Rachel Wood (above) plays the role of Dolores Abernathy in HBO’s science-fiction thriller series Westworld.
Westworld, HBO’s newest series, was created by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy (Christopher Nolan’s brother and sister-in-law, respectively). The show, which is based on the 1973 Michael Chricton movie of the same name, premiered on Sunday night — with promises of becoming the network’s next Game of Thrones.
In the first episode, Dr. Robert Ford, played by Anthony Hopkins, delivered this line: “This is as good as we’re going to get.” Ford is talking about several things in this moment — but to the audience, it’s clear that the state of humanity is what’s truly troubling him.
Westworld’s plot concerns the fictional park of West World — a theme park created in the future based on “the Old West,” replete with saloons, cowboys, outlaws, murders and show downs. Though the pilot doesn’t discuss delve into the entire mythos of the series, the film Westworld also features two other “worlds,” Roman World and Medieval World. The presence of all three worlds gives a sense of the different options and desires for humans in the future.
The show itself is rife with with complex sociological and psychological musings — how would we, humanity, treat life-like “hosts” (robots) whose sole purpose is to enact our own fantasies? Would we view them with respect or disdain or something in between?
“We wanted to go flat out, full scope, sleeves-rolled-up plunge into the next chapter of the human story, in which we stop being the protagonists,” co-creator Jonathan Nolan said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly.
The pilot, while fascinating, felt tedious at times because of the dialogue’s complexity without much elucidation. But that isn’t to dismiss it. What Westworld offers far exceeds what it doesn’t.
Shortly after its premiere, television bloggers and critics were quick to jump on the bandwagon criticizing the pilot’s “gratuitous” violence, especially violence toward women. Evan Rachel Wood, who plays protagonist Dolores Abernathy, spoke out soon thereafter, promising that the violence was leading to something bigger.
“I don’t like gratuitous violence against women at all, but I would wait for the context in which it’s being used,” Wood said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. Meanwhile, co-creator Lisa Joy explained that series examines the extremes of human nature, from love to violence.
Though the violence left many watching disturbed, I wondered why so many were quick to judge the pilot — considering that HBO’s extremely successful Game of Thrones is rife with continual beheadings, murders and other acts of violence.
Of course, being the author of this column means I am no stranger to snap-judgments and quick assertions all in the name of getting “the story.” However, I felt frustrated that the internet did not give the pilot the benefit of the doubt, especially when we only have one hour of a ten part series to base our judgments.
What Westworld’s pilot did provide, however, was a look into what seems to be a diverse cast. Not only is our main protagonist a woman, but women also occupy many important roles — or roles that will later rise to prominence later in the series. Wood’s character, though seemingly naive and idealistic, is actually the oldest host in the park — proving her importance to both the plot and the characters within the show.
There’s also the manager of Westworld, played by Sisdse Babett Knudsen, who rules with an iron fist and isn’t afraid of standing up to her male colleagues.  Of course, positive gender politics blur when examining the park itself, wherein classical western stereotypes are substantiates through the exploitative use of hookers and prostitutes. However, the showrunner’s goals are meant to challenge such stereotypes and examine them.
Westworld is by no means a perfect show, but so far its diverse representation more than makes up for its somewhat confusing narrative and seemingly gratuitous violence. Unlike what the character Dr. Robert Ford said in the pilot, the show seems to promise that more good entertainment is just around the corner, instead of already being in our rearview mirror.

Photo courtesy of USC Thornton School of MusicAll that jazz · The musicians of USC’s Jazz Orchestra will perform a set of contemporary pieces under the direction of Bob Mintzer, head of the Jazz Studies department, at Ground Zero Perfomance Café.
On Thursday, the renowned USC Thornton Jazz Orchestra will perform at Ground Zero Performance Café at 7 p.m. The performance is part of the orchestra’s ongoing jazz night series, which has taken place throughout the semester, typically on Thursday evenings. The event will showcase not only the talented, vibrant musicians of the highly selective jazz studies program at the University, but also the contemporary pieces that they have been mastering throughout the semester.
Bob Mintzer, chair of the Jazz Studies program, will direct the ensemble. Mintzer’s ensemble features undergraduate students who play a variety of instruments, including drums, trombones and trumpets.
Mintzer is not only a revered faculty of the USC Thornton School of Music, but for the past 40 years, has been a prominent contributor to jazz music. Well-educated in his craft, Mintzer attended the Hart College of Music and the Manhattan School of Music, where he learned to play the saxophone and the bass clarinet. 
He is also a seasoned performer who has ventured to musical festivals and events across the country. He has been a member of a variety of musical groups, some of which include the Thad Jones Mel Lewis Big Band, the Buddy Rich Big Band, the Bob Mintzer Big Band and, most notably, the Yellowjackets, a Grammy award-winning band that has been performing since 1977.
In educating his jazz students, Mintzer, as well as other faculty members in the Jazz department, seeks to prepare his students to become professional, working musicians. He trains them in a variety of styles and also gives many of them a chance to perform in professional ensembles — an opportunity that is often unavailable to undergraduate musicians.
 Beyond the professional exposure, Mintzer encourages his students to connect with their music, and in turn better hone their craft.
“When working with students, my objective is to inspire their desire to develop personal and systematic pathways toward becoming a better musician,” said Mintzer in an interview with the Thornton School of Music. “Tricks of the trade and commentary on a student’s work are part and parcel, but it ultimately hinges on the work each student does on his or her own to connect with the music” 
Students are welcome to attend this upcoming Jazz Night performance and experience the dynamic repertoire of these adept musicians. 
The event will take place on Thursday and is open to the public. Seating is provided on a first-come, first-served basis. No RSVP is needed.

For a moment, let’s forget Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative. Wind the clock back to 1929. The stock market crashed and the nation fell into the Great Depression. Millions of families struggled for survival. What did the presidency mean then, during the worst crisis in American history? What must people have thought about Hoover or FDR as they stood hours in line for a bowl of soup? 
In that era, the president must have been a position that dedicated itself to serve the people, not serving itself. It must have taken a person who saw what was happening to the people and lead them, restore them, care for them. But in 2016, the presidency does not seem to mean the same thing. After witnessing so much mudslinging at last Monday’s presidential debate between Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, it should provoke much thought on whether or not the two nominees appreciate the gravity of the position they seek. The honor that the presidency used to bestow has become gray and moth-eaten as the culture surrounding politics is turning more and more into a circus rather than a circle of intellect. French political scientist Alexis De Tocqueville must be rolling in his grave as American democracy experiences heartbreaking disdain, neglect and insult from we the people.
No, Mrs. Clinton, being president does not mean you get to push your agenda using shady deals. No, Mr. Trump, being president is not a tool to bully your opponents. No, to anyone out there thinking about being president -— it’s not a way to immortalize yourself and finally “make it” in life. The presidency is not about you. An agenda is an agenda — not the end itself. But to the dismay of so many of us, when you think of the word “president,” you think of someone who’s pushing their personal ambitions just to show that they can. People keep saying the political system in America is stupid, broken, inefficient, gridlocked every time something good tries to pass. Two-party politics has paralyzed anything meaningful from happening in the domestic agenda or foreign policy. Congressmembers make more of a living pulling stupid stunts on television rather than actually asking what their districts or states want.
The Oval Office used to seat men who valued character over party politics. But character is the last word many people think of when they see the two nominees running for president right now. Both candidates love popularity. But there is a difference between popularity and legacy. Legacy is why we still admire John Adams, Abraham Lincoln and FDR long past their lifetimes. People will have perennial respect for these men not only because of what they did, but also because of how they did it. The job of the president isn’t to be a sociopathic utilitarian political machine. It demands leadership, not sound bites. Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump, why do you want to run for president? Is it because you care about the American people? Do you intend to serve? This is what serving looks like: surrendering a seat of honor, putting others before yourself, loving others more than yourself, to be okay going unrecognized, to constantly seek the counsel of those around you, especially those who will criticize you. It demands a kind of humility usually unseen in Washington. It’s the kind of humility every parent teaches their children in the hope that they will learn what we could not. 
The presidency is the highest position in the land, one that was meant to be fulfilled by men and women nominated for their intelligence, wisdom and above all, unchallenged character. However, despite all that has been said, it is not the opinion of this piece to poise a dark, pessimistic outlook. The United States has an amazingly resilient political system. It has a long future ahead. Yet, this is about restoring the diminished honor that once cloaked the office of executive. It’s time for selfless service to make a welcome return to the office of the President of the United States. 
I keep reading and hearing that the majority of registered voters of each party take the position of voting against the opposing candidate, rather than favoring the candidate of their own party. I can believe that. History and poli sci majors: Are you aware of a past Presidential election where both the candidates were of such low popularity and regarded so dismally?

In his seminal 1965 report “The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,” politician Daniel Patrick Moynihan opened with the words, “The United States is approaching a new crisis in race relations.” He couldn’t have been more right then, and he’s just as right now.
Moynihan argued that while the defeats of slavery and segregation had granted African Americans liberty and guaranteed a certain “Equality of Opportunity” for the African American community, there had been no concomitant “Equality of Results.” And absent a broad “Equality of Results” between urban black America and suburban white America, Moynihan argued that “there will be no social peace in the United States for generations.”
My fellow Republicans loathe the term “Equality of Results” and worship the idea of  “Equality of Opportunity”, but the fact of the matter is that Moynihan was right — “Equality of Opportunity” alone, without broad “Equality of Results”,  leads to great social inequality; social harmony amid great social inequality is impossible; and if we want the shootings, the riots and protests and the identity politics to cease, we would do well to proactively deal with that social and economic inequality. 
 So let’s get a couple of things straight. 
The main issue facing urban black America is socioeconomic inequality and the ensuing social decay. Racism remains a serious issue, but it cannot be dealt with in what is called a “policy-relevant” timeframe — attitudes die hard and take generations to change. Of course we should work on it, in areas from police reform to representation. But in a purely distributive sense, it is much more practical to address the bread-and-butter concerns of black America, and helping alleviate poverty in inner cities and bring more members of the African American community to middle-class status will do infinitely more than “reeducating” wannabe Klansmen to be more progressively minded.
There are two primary obstacles to resolving the question of socioeconomic inequality — chronic underinvestment in the drivers of growth and stability in these communities, and poor, dysfunctional governance based on a model that barely worked in the last century. 
We can talk all we want about entrepreneurship and competition, which are important to growth. But fundamentally, community economic development is a political decision, not just a result of economic forces. Decisions about where public and public-private funds go are decided politically, and though money isn’t everything, it certainly is a large component in economic development and management. Who subsidizes whom is a more important question than proper tax rates.
Even so, funds can be wasted, particularly in the urban communities where many lower-class African Americans live. And this brings us to the second obstacle: dysfunctional governance. When local governments are bureaucratically minded and focused more on methods than results, they tend to grow unresponsive and inefficient. In a world of poor schools, potholed roads and long lines at the DMV and hospital, not to mention distant police forces who patrol rather than serve their communities, does it really matter if it’s easier for someone to get a loan and start a business?
This toxic combination of underinvestment and dysfunctional governance feeds into itself and destroys individuals and families, thereby destroying the community. As Moynihan noted, there is a cycle of social services, economic opportunity and family stability: “Employment in turn reflects educational achievement, which depends in large part on family stability, which reflects employment.“
The War on Poverty failed to serve the black poor. Supply-side economics and trickle-down theory failed to serve the black poor. The welfare reforms of the Clinton Administration failed to serve the black poor. No Child Left Behind under Bush, and the Affordable Care Act under Obama, failed to serve the black poor. Corrupt city governments and clueless state governments have for five decades since the Civil Rights Act failed to serve the black poor. And we are living under the consequences of those failures.
To be frank, the police shootings that Black Lives Matter activists focus so heavily on are nowhere near the most important issue the black community faces, though they’re easily the most galvanizing. And reforming police departments across the country under good-government standards amenable to the activist community is putting a Band-Aid on a gaping laceration. 
A transformation of the living standards of the inner-city African American communities is in order, and it will take much institutional reform and public investment. Bringing the multiracial and especially the black poor into the middle class will be no easy task. But it is a continuation of the great work of justice and equality that reformers have pushed for since the founding, and we should not be intimidated by it.

Last Wednesday, the Theatre at Ace Hotel hosted an event that even my dad was jealous of missing. To celebrate legendary radio DJ Gilles Peterson’s birthday, a collective of funky musicians came together to inspire a crowd the way Peterson has inspired many. A lineup made up of BadBadNotGood, Miguel Atwood Ferguson, Nai Palm, Kamasi Washington and the famed George Clinton were just a few of the insanely talented and influential artists who came out to put together an unforgettable performance.
Leaving the Ace in awe, I found myself enthralled and enlightened. The revered Peterson and many musicians who made an ordinary Wednesday something much more than just that stirred up something within me, which motivated me to put together this jazz playlist to remember the night.

Week two of delicious vegan food in our enormous LA area and I had to return to the OG Vegan eats location. Whether you’re vegan or not, I’m going to pretty safely bet that you’ve at least heard of Cafe Gratitude – I began eating here well before I “officially” introduced a vegan diet into the rest of my lifestyle.

Cafe Gratitude, for those of you in the dark here, is an all-vegan, super delicious, offers-everything restaurant with a number of locations here in LA – our closest locations to USC are those in the Arts District and Larchmont, but we can’t forget to mention the super-hip and gorgeous Venice Beach location, too!
With a menu spanning over delicious bowls (curry, Mexican mucho bowls, healthy grain bowls, etc.), burgers, wraps, pizzas, raw desserts, fruit cobblers with ice cream, “milkshakes” and so much more, you’re going to want to go here for breakfast, lunch and dinner. (Oh, and it’s on Postmates… so… you can!)
They also host a free meal on Thanksgiving for anyone who wishes to attend. I (the foreigner who had nowhere to be during Thanksgiving break last year!) took myself and my non-vegan friend along for lunch, and it was delicious, free and incredibly welcoming! You sit at the tables with strangers who are there for the same reason – good food and good company!
You can check out Cafe Gratitude’s menu here, or their incredible instagram here (yes, I follow their Instagram – it’s marvelous).
And for those of you who can’t seem to get enough Mexican food but are somewhat sick of Chipotle bowls and burritos, check out Gracias Madre, an all-vegan Mexican restaurant located in West Hollywood, brought to you by the same geniuses that created Cafe Gratitude. 
(The fact that my incredibly non-vegan dad who loves good food and can be crazy picky chooses to eat here when he visits me in LA says…. A lot.)

Q: I am going through a tough financial time where I’m struggling to pay for college while working as many shifts as I can, and my ends still aren’t meeting. I don’t want to leave school with student loans piled on my back, but at the same time I can’t afford to stay at college even with financial aid. What would you do if you were in my situation? 
Please pat yourself on the back. You are an incredible person. And… if no one has ever told you this, you are amazing.  
It is my firm belief that education shouldn’t be an option solely for the wealthy. Our sky-high tuition is outrageous and I am so incredibly sorry that our financial aid office does not do more for you. However, I know that your options right now are limited and so I will give you my frank advice. 
If I were you, I would very carefully weigh my options. If you haven’t yet, I would definitely talk to the financial aid office in person. I have heard of so many situations where talking to the office in person has drastically altered the outcome. Afterwards, I would honestly look at the job(s) you have. Are you working on campus? Do you have a job outside of campus? There are some jobs that often have a higher pay rate on this campus so doing a bit of research could help. Also, if you have the means to, sometimes working a paid internship off campus will pay you better than jobs on campus. Lastly, I would see how you’re budgeting your money. Are you going out to eat often? Are you having to buy some food on campus? If you are, I would genuinely think about meal-prepping, etc. I know much of social life in college can revolve around eating out, but your true friends will understand. Also, if you can hold out another semester; applying for continuing student scholarships can definitely help– apply to the alumni club ones, your respective school ones, etc. 
Truthfully, student loans suck and if you feel like that number is getting too high– I would think about maybe taking a semester off. That’s probably the least ideal option, but if you take a semester off, make some money, and then come back to attend school, that could help so much. I’m not one to share my life on the internet, but I can’t imagine my school journey had it not been for my dad’s consistent dedication to his education when he was younger. He took 6 years to graduate college because he was working odd jobs (taking semesters off) to pay for that tuition. 
I praise you in whatever decision you decide to take– whether that is staying, taking a semester off, or transferring, etc… It’s not an easy one and I am so sorry that the price tag for our education is this damn high.
If any administrator at USC happens to stumble upon this article, I beg you to take a look at where our school’s tuition is now and yet, how high our endowment is. The two don’t add up. I beg you to think about the students whose parents are working 80+ hours to send them to this school. I ask you to reflect upon how some students are working tirelessly and studying endlessly to get this education. I urge you to talk to students because not everyone can afford that estimated cost of attendance (~$70,000). Our USC degree may come with its benefits, but to earn a degree at the cost of our mental, physical, and social well being is absurd. Tell me how a university can view education as a business and student’s health as secondary to our donor’s dollars. If our campus was really made of a family, shouldn’t we be trying to assist our family members? If you really wanted to give students an enriching experience– you would focus on the students, not your pockets.
