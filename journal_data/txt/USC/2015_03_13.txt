Last Saturday consisted of an afternoon trip to a small city outside of Seoul, courtesy of my roommate, who had taught English there a few years back.
Paju is north of Seoul, not too far from the North-South Korea border. Close enough to the point that another member of our group geotagged his location and proceeded to post it onto Facebook accompanied with a quip about paying a visit to Kim Jong-Un. That being said, there are more notable qualities to Paju, other than its proximity to an international demarcation. English Village, is an example of one such quality.
Designed to be an immersive learning experience and theme park hybrid, Paju’s English Village tries to mimic the feel of a small English community, complete with elements such as a post office, an English pub, and a theater. The Stonehenge replica just outside of its front doors and the relatively vacant buildings inside offer the promise of a kitschy day trip on one of your days off from work of school.
Other than English Village, Paju is also home to a sizeable outlet mall, which may be what attracts visitors to Paju year-round, as well as a thriving artist community, as demonstrated by Heyri Art Village. The outlet mall is a strange sight in Paju, which was less-developed and calm compared to the non-stop bustling of Seoul. The giant complex not only seems out of place due to its appearance in a much less developed part of Korea, but also due to the fact that outlet malls seem very much like an American concept.

That being said, foreign influence is ever-present in Korea outside of outlet malls and English Village. Whether through reality shows on television that feature foreigners speaking fluent Korean or storefront signs with words that are in Korean but are phonetically English, it’s interesting to see how non-Korean elements have become integrated into modern Korean society. It makes me wonder how Korean culture will change in response to its willingness to accept foreignness.
We live in a truly globalizing world and I know I’m lucky to be able to be having the experiences abroad that allow me to make that conclusion first hand.

Pisces (Feb. 22 to March 20)
“True Life: Lil B from the Pack.” They are the suburban cheerleaders of the zodiac signs. Excessive positivity, one-track mindedness, and baseless optimism are all apparent as a Pisces is consistently talking over people to get his or her point across. Cracked out on genuine hope for humanity, the psychological age of these December babies is parallel to that of a 30-year-old who made the mistake of going to UCLA. What they lack in common sense, they make up for in supportiveness and in the ability to make connections.

Aries (March 21 to Apr. 19)
“You’re 12. Literally.”If the characteristics of a zodiac sign could equate to a specific type of Tinder profile picture, an Aries would be a mirror selfie with the flash left on; basically, these January babies are perpetually 12 years old, because an early birth date accounted for their peaking in 6th grade. Luckily, the connections made at that age are hard to let go of and they are categorized under an energetic, outgoing, competitive alpha archetype. While being cool in middle school has its perks, the pressure to live up to the Photo Booth days has forced the Aries population to live vicariously through the internet. The special skill set of an Aries is astute social media prowess; in addition to having the hottest yaks on YikYak, they have at least 100+ likes on their Facebook profile pictures because real middle school cred never dies.

Taurus (Apr. 20 to May 20)
“We should totally just stab Caesar!” The ‘T’ in Taurus actually stands for Tiger Mom, as people of this sign strategically use their harsh wit and sarcasm to cover up how political and opportunist they really are. Remember the girl in high school who was second in her class? A Taurus is her college counselor. Essentially, these individuals are natural-born overachievers, marred by their hatred or instability of everything. Nothing is ever enough for a Taurus. What they lack for in academic grace, they make up for in social climbing. When they are not rolling their eyes, they are busy being the most personable, relatable and professional students out there. The humility of life as a Taurus will fuel their ability to ace interviews and secure any job of their choosing. As soon as these individuals let go of their control freak ways and learn to compete with themselves instead of other people, they can successfully update the current status of their LinkedIn accounts to working as a CEO, senator and head surgeon (all at once).

Gemini (May 21 to June 21)
If you already reading this, then it’s already too late. Everybody loves a Gemini, because they have perfected the ability to maintain goof-ball humor while still being pathetically cute. Fact: Katy Perry’s left shark from the Superbowl is a Gemini. Also, adult braces were also first introduced to the world by a Gemini. When they are not uploading ‘white girl dancing’ snaps to the USC Campus story, their adjustable, versatile, enthusiastic and silly traits make them loved by all. Their hobbies include excessive socializing and meeting new people. The “About Me” section of a Gemini’s Instagram biography adheres to a strict format:
(1) Gemini Name.
(2) Zodiac Sign. (Gemini).
(3) Hometown. (LA—>LA)
(4) Age. (13)
(5) College Name. (USC ’15)
(6) Major. (Biology is what defines me)
(7) Extremely cliche quote. (I live for the nights I can’t remember with the people I can’t forget.)
(8) Random emoji 
 

They will follow you back!
Cancer (June 22 to July 22)
When they are not hysterically sobbing over the last season of House of Cards, Cancers are busy out-sassing their peers with witty wordplay, unbridled cynicism and crisp sarcasm. They are everyone’s confidant and emotional partner, as their sensitivity coupled with a sharp sense of humor provides the perfect balance of understanding and tough love. Embodying the notion of ‘Treat Yo Self!” from Parks and Recreation, a Cancer will always encourage you to indulge in yourself. Whether it be binge shopping or heavy drinking, they will bring out the hedonist in you. Keep in mind these are the kids who started watching porn in the 5th grade: overexposure means that nothing is too much for a Cancer. Most importantly, Cancers are well known for their ability to perform full on concerts covering their favorite rap artists while under the influence. They are very particular about their tastes in music, food, and literature.

Leo (July 23 to Aug. 22)
“Stop trying to make fetch happen.” Leo is the Spanish word for poser. Kylie Jenner is the poster child for the July/August birth cause. They are very much consumed with material items and choose to accept the idea of people, yet they reject the people themselves. The fake way in which they treat people regards them as socially inept. In fact, their personalities are about as active and ‘popping’ as the Jonas Brothers in 2008. Outrageously entitled, they always believe they are right and often times argue for things that do not make any sense. As soon as a Leo stops trying to be something he or she is not, the world will yield great opportunities in terms of work and relationships.

Virgo (Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
“***Flawless.” Virgo is the only sign untouched by negative qualities and serious character flaws. Virgos are highly intelligent and very informed about society. They also combine the triad of wit, merit, and beauty effortlessly. They are naturally articulate and have the capacity to say only things that are worth hearing. Above all else, they are known for being hard workers. Virgos Samantha Power and the author of this blog post are born on the day, which ultimately makes the case for their title of the “Best People in America and Abroad.” Most Virgos learn how to speak after the first week of their conception and they usually teach themselves advanced level Bikram yoga in the womb. Fact: Beyonce is a Virgo.

Libra (Sept. 23 to Oct. 23)
“No filter!” Libras are best identified by their posts and overall social media presence. Their behavior is made up of number of patterns: (1) If you see a pressed juice pictured in front of a car steering wheel, know that it is most definitely the work of a Libra and that the juice itself was bought for the sole purpose of ‘sharing’ on Instagram. (2) Ever seen a picture of toes on social media? It is the gross and socially unacceptable by-product of their trademark cluelessness. No one wants to see your feet naked! (3) Libras never pose in photos alone; in fact, all of their posts are mid-narrative in an effort to create a faux edgy and fashionable appearance. These include and are not limited to pictures of uncontrollable laughing between two parties, captioned with an unrelated quote OR a couple in which one party is looking at the ground overwhelmed by the need to feign emotion. Offline, however, Libras are the greatest people you will ever meet as their unwavering compassion, sensitivity, and understanding toward others supersedes any issues they may have with themselves. You can always trust and believe in the potential of a Libra.

Scorpio (Oct. 24 to Nov. 20)
“I’m kind of a big deal.” The stereotype of the Scorpio being some kind of overtly sexual subspecies has accounted for its evolution from a group of charismatic people to those a pretentious one. If a Scorpio could be ranked on the Greek Fraternity system, it would without a doubt get a bid from TKE. With respectful to their sparkling personalities, they speak loudly and with purpose — just to hear the sound of their own voice. On the other hand, this level of rudeness contributes significantly to a Scorpio’s cynicism and elitist humor. Nevertheless, their sense of entitlement will eventually work to their advantage as fearlessness and confidence are imperative to making it in the corporate world.

Sagittarius (Nov. 21 to Dec. 20) 
**‘i’ by Kendrick Lamar plays in the background** A Sagittarius is, above all else, notorious for its fire-cracker personality and outspokenness. If Nicki Minaj’s verse on ‘Monster’ could be a person, it would be one born in November. As social butterflies, these individuals love partying almost as much as they love themselves. A Sagittarius is the type of person who looks into a window and tries to use it as a mirror. A study shows that the Sagittarius population only spends one-third of their lives sober; because of this, their intense drinking has become habitual to the point in which they resort drinking water out of shot glasses. Moreover, these are the type of people who have about 400 selfies on their camera roll. Also, if you know someone who has an unhealthy amount of baby photos in their photo stream, you know without a doubt that they are a Sagittarius.

 
Capricorn (Dec. 23 to Jan. 20) 
There’s Something About Mary. Hanging out with a Capricorn is liking watching Jamie Lee Curtis on an Activa commercial: completely pointless, very confusing and slightly uncomfortable. Capricorns are very secretive and aloof compared to the rest of the astrological signs; much of their nature remains unknown. These individuals are the pariahs of the zodiac community. They are very studious and are part of the select few who still attend lecture. Capricorns are found in the basement of Leavey, where they are free to be their quirky, idiosyncratic, and nerdy selves!

Aquarius (Jan. 21 to Feb. 21) 
We get it…Your mom actually likes you. An Aquarius is the product of a successful upper middle class upbringing and a solid college education. This means that his mother essentially went to PTA meetings, consistently volunteered at high school jazz festivals and completed all three of his college essays. An Aquarius is what happens when a person’s parents  keep their marriage intact, willingly avoid divorce and genuinely like each other. The Aquarius population constantly participates in class, because for some ridiculous reason they have been lied to believe that their opinions actually matter. Much of a conversation with an Aquarius is inflated with meaningless and filler exchanges, as they never know precisely what they are talking about; regardless, these students are active as the heads of USG government and other camp organizations while they intern at the most requitable companies in L.A. Their means of securing a place in society may be questionable but the work they put in to stay there is ultimately telling of an Aquarius’s merit, sincerity and diligence.

I am currently studying abroad for the Spring 2015 semester at Yonsei University which is located in Seoul, South Korea. The following are specific to either South Korea or Yonsei University.
For those who are staying in South Korea for over 90 days (all students who are studying abroad or planning to study abroad in South Korea) must apply for alien registration at a local immigration office within 90 days of arrival.  At Yonsei, there is “orientation week” (usually the last week of February) which is about a week before classes actually begin. This is when most study abroad students arrive. A few days before classes begin (the last few days of February or the first few days of March) is usually when the Korean students and the international students (attending the university for three or more years) arrive. Thus, it is best to go register for your alien registration card as soon as you arrive, and when you have time available. The immigration offices offer a variety of services and serve large regions, so it is always busy, but gets even more so in early March when classes begin, and all of the students arrive.
Korea’s academic year starts in March and ends in December. In Korea, the first semester is from March to June, and the second semester is from August to December. In relation to USC’s academic calendar, if you’re studying abroad in the spring semester, you have a long winter break.
When you arrive in Korea, you’ll be arriving during the end of winter. Going to school in Los Angeles, you don’t really experience “winter.” In Korea, however, the weather drops to about 30°F. Additionally, there’s a lot of “Asian dust” or “yellow sand” (which can be harmful to your health because of the pollutants that is carried with the dust) that blows in from mainland China. Thus, you’ll see many people wearing masks around, also to protect their faces from the harsh weather during the winter and spring seasons.

Jasmine Li | Daily Trojan
Last Friday, I was (yet again) strutting about the all-famous Ueno Park. The Park, I should mention, consists largely of well-groomed lawns and copses, which surround walkways leading to a number of shrines and popular attractions, such as Ueno Zoo, and various art, history, and science museums. This time though, unlike the last, I wasn’t there for an art exhibition, but for the National Museum of Nature and Science in Ueno.
By the entrance, a life-size figure of a blue whale reared its head towards the sky, like a monument to the colossal size of the museum. After wandering about echoing halls for upwards of five hours, I had only cleared about three-quarters of the exhibitions, though I had been going at a rushed pace, with often no more than a cursory glance at the explanatory panels. Dinosaur skeletons, a 360-degree movie depicting the Big Bang and early life on Earth, and a complete history of clocks, cameras, and space itself were only a fraction of what the place had to offer.
The exhibition that drew my attention the most, however, focused on human history. A section of the exhibit had been dedicated to the development of the Japanese islands—archipelagians, in various stages of evolution, were frozen and put into glass boxes. It began with likenesses of the humans who lived during the early, half-mystical Jōmon or Cord-Pattern Period (dated from about 12,000 to 300 BCE, and so named for its pottery, which was decorated with imprints of straw rope) and moved gradually up to the modern period. At the end of the line stood a case with one of its sides missing, into which visitors were invited to stand and claim their rightful place in history.
A corner of the exhibit featured animals that were historically important to the island—containing the usual oxen, horses, and fowl. However, standing out among the stuffed figures was a beautiful white Akita Inu, with a single name inscribed on its placard: Hachiko. Hachiko, in life, was a dog known for his tender loyalty to his owner—which ran so deep that even after Professor Ueno passed away, for the next nine years, Hachiko continued to appear at the station exactly when the professor’s train was due. His bronze statue still stands vigil outside of Shibuya Station to this day; his actual body, as mentioned, is preserved in the National Museum.
Nowhere near the figure, though, was any sort of explanation of the life of Hachiko—just the name on the placard. Though I raised my eyebrows at this at first, I figured that it was probably because in Japan, it’s near inconceivable there could exist any person (who doesn’t live under a rock) who hasn’t heard of the story of Hachiko. Certainly, I knew and loved the tale so much that I stood in front of Hachiko’s case for a good five minutes, hardly daring to breathe.
I felt like I had come face-to-face with a small legend.
