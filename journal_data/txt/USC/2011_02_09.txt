Monish Tyagi and Logan Lachman, who are running for Undergraduate Student Government’s president and vice-president, are one of the more experienced tickets on this year’s ballot.

Both candidates have been involved with USG since their first semester as freshmen. Tyagi, a junior majoring in cinema-television production, is currently the director of USG’s Campus Affairs committee. Lachman, a sophomore majoring in communication, is a current USG Greek senator.
Tyagi and Lachman believe their experience in groups ranging from Greek Life to Troy Camp to club sports allows them to connect more with fellow students and become more effective leaders in USG.
“USG is by far my biggest passion here at USC,” Tyagi said. “From day one, I saw the power that USG had to work with students. This place has really become my home and what I really love about USG is that it’s such a tangible way to give back.”
The two candidates constructed a campaign strategy and platform that reflect their commitment to fellow students as well as their desire to encourage a more unified and involved student body.
Part of their plan to foster an increasingly active student life on campus includes working with Student Affairs to extend the hours of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and to play music in the courtyard.
“The Ronald Tutor Campus Center has been such an amazing addition to campus,” Tyagi said. “We want to keep that going and build upon it to really make it a driving force behind student life on campus.”
In addition to working with Student Affairs, Tyagi and Lachman hope to unify the student body by coordinating with other campus spirit organizations to help create a more centralized student section for basketball games and events prior to the games.
“This school is amazing and has so much to offer,” Lachman said. “Some people might not know how to get involved but everyone is able to, and I really hope that’s the one thing we can do if we are elected, to make everyone in this school feel unified and a part of something.”
Tyagi and Lachman plan to get students more involved by providing input on various programs, such as concerts, guest speakers and Visions & Voices events. They hope to increase the amount of communication among various students and organizations as well.
“For this to happen we want to hold more types of events that will connect students, student organizations and USG,” Lachman said. “We want to connect administrators to students, but also students to students because they don’t necessarily get to communicate the way they should, so we want to create a central hub to put everyone together the way they should be.”
Their platform also includes goals like increasing opportunities for students to find on-campus jobs, creating an alumni mentorship program, adding a fall break, improving the tram system and focusing more effort on sustainability initiatives for both on- and off-campus housing.
Since beginning their campaign Monday, Tyagi and Lachman have made a point of personally interacting with students campus.
They have also tried to lighten the mood of election season with their hot pink campaign shirts, posters featuring caricatures of themselves and campaign videos that play off of the popular Dos Equis advertisements starring “The Most Interesting Man in the World.”
“We just want to get students excited because this election could get pretty intense and pretty serious, as it should be, but at the same time there is a lot of fun surrounding it,” Tyagi said. “It’s been really great to see USC students so excited about the election.”

USC’s new Academy of Polymathic Study held its inaugural event Wednesday night to promote the integration of multiple disciplines.
David Brooks, an award-winning New York Times columnist, and Antonio Damasio, a USC professor and David Dornsife chair in neuroscience, led a discussion about the science of being human Wednesday night in Doheny Memorial Library to introduce to students the types of topics that will be covered in future seminars.
Scholar · Sidney Harman, creator of the Academy of Polymathic Study, talked about polymaths, people who excel in multiple disciplines. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan 
Sidney Harman, a business professor who has been a guest lecturer in architecture, law and art classes at USC, created the academy to emphasize the exploration of the thinking process. Undergraduate and graduate students are currently applying to become a part of the academy.
The seminars aim to encourage students and faculty to engage in conversation about the exploration of critical thinking through the study of polymaths, people who master a number of topics such as Albert Einstein, Aristotle, Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo, Goethe, Thomas Jefferson and others.
“This academy, for a number of reasons will include the lessons we of the faculty have gathered from a study of the lives and the works of the polymaths,” Harman said. “They engaged, synthesized, they integrated the disciplines so that their art became philosophy and their philosophy became technology.”
Wednesday’s discussion focused on views of personhood.
Brooks said one should analyze a person’s subconscious instead of trying to comprehend their rationality and motivations.
“Many of the diagnoses that people need to do very rapidly aren’t made consciously,” Brooks said.
Damasio said it is a person’s emotions as functions of the subconscious that have evolved to direct a person’s actions.
“Think about fear, joy, anger or disgust,” Damasio said. “They’re emotions that are shared by a large number of creatures. That emotion has evolved to regulate life.”
Brooks illuminated this principle by instructing the audience to flip a coin. He said it’s not about whether the coin shows heads or tails, but about your response to the outcome.
“Flip a coin and observe your reaction to the coin flip,” Brooks said. “Don’t go by the flip. Go by the reaction.”
Though the average college student might be unaccustomed to scouring history books and psychological studies to examine what Harman calls the magic behind the achievements of Renaissance men, students who attended the event left just as much inspired as overwhelmed.
“The fact that you’re going to liken something as abstract as human behavior to something as concrete as science is very interesting to me,” said Brian Nguyen, an undeclared freshman.
Edward Saavedra, a freshman majoring in cinematic arts, said he is excited to attend the upcoming lectures.
“I found it kind of inspring, for instance the way sociology and psychology are connected,” Saavedra said.
Harman said the emphasis of the future seminars will not focus on the polymaths’ achievements, but how they became adept at multiple disciplines.
“We will reach for what we lovingly call our tapestry, which is the engagement with the interactive character of art, technology and philosophy,” Harman said.
Tara McPherson, associate professor of the School of Cinematic Arts; Warren Bennis, professor of business administration; and Geoff Cowan, professor for the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism will lead future seminars about polymaths.

According to Food, Inc., the 2008 documentary film about corporate farming, we are all walking Doritos with limbs, fed primarily by big evil corporations.
These big corporations were the main topic of Wednesday night’s discussion between best-selling authors Eric Schlosser and Michael Pollan, held at Bovard Auditorium moderated by KCRW’s Good Food radio host Evan Kleiman.
Monopolies · Michael Pollan (left) and Eric Schlosser discussed the control of big companies over the meat-packing industry, as well as how the public can take the power over food from the government. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
“The power of big corporations like ConAgra, Monsanto and Walmart is incredible,” Schlosser said. “They are the ones pulling all the strings behind the government and the food we eat.”
Both Schlosser and Pollan are active figures in issues pertaining to food sustainability and industries. They did years of investigative work on food politics and production, exposing the government’s role in unsanitary and discriminatory farm practices through detailed, no-holds-barred books that shocked the country.
Pollan’s In Defense of Food: An Eater’s Manifesto won the James Beard Award and Schlosser’s Fast Food Nation stayed at the New York Times’s best-sellers list for two years.
Meanwhile, Kleiman is founder of the Slow Food Chapter in Los Angeles and also serves in the Stewardship Council of Roots of Change, both which are organizations promoting a sustainable food system.
Debating Walmart’s recent five-year plan to repackage its food to include lower amounts of unhealthy salts, fats and sugars, both Schlosser and Pollan were hopeful, but critical.
“Walmart is the biggest grocery store that feeds 40 percent of America,” Pollan said. “I think if they figure out how to [offer healthier products] profitably, there can be significant changes.”
Scholosser offered a more cynical view.
“The real problem, however, is still that there shouldn’t be any companies that powerful,” Schlosser said. “Ultimately it’s about unchecked power, and how corruptive it is.”
According to Pollan and Schlosser, the idyllic days of local farmers and happy cow pastures are over. The food industry has changed drastically. Farms are getting bigger and producing more, but according to Schlosser and Pollan, these “specialty crops” subsidized by the government never actually enter the consumer’s mouth.
“Over 75 percent that [the farmers] produce is fed to livestock,” Pollan said. “The remainder is turned into ethanol to feed our cars. Even so, 50 percent of food grown for humans is thrown away, uneaten.”
Because of America’s deeply complicated food politics, Pollan and Schlosser said the public is often misinformed about what they eat.
Pollan’s deceivingly simple food motto, “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants,” trails into more intense debates from the inaccessibility of expensive organic and health products for the vast majority of America to the obscure yet prominent lobbying and power food farming corporations have over politics.
Parisa Rezvani, a graduate student studying visual anthropology, said she found the discussion to be interesting.
“I hope this talk can accurately inform students because food politics is often confusing and there’s a lot of misinformation,” Rezvani said.
Meanwhile, Michael Zarky, 64,  who has been vegetarian for 44 years, said he thinks people need to be more wise with their spending.
“The food movement is mostly for the upper-middle class only,” Zarky said. “People need to stop spending money on stupid things and support local farmers.”
I don’t believe one could call this a discussion.  it is much more of a one-sided lovefest for the foodie “religion.”
See, that’s my Opinion.  Mr. Pollan and Mr. Schlosser have their opinions too, and tend to continually state them as fact.  Couple that with an underlying hatred for capitalism and a warped view on modern agriculture and you have two very charming, controversial pot-stirrers….
If we could feed the planet the same way we did 20 years ago, 50 years ago, or 100 years ago, we would have not needed to devote the years of research and development into agriculture.  
PS…Organic means “we can only spray some of this stuff that’s approved” and more often than not, the organic produce is sprayed and fertilized much heavier than standard crops.
Always remember.
Hug your friendly farmer, they enjoy feeding you, even though they’re made out to look like criminals by these guys.
Last night’s event was great.  Thanks for the recap.
I think the writer misinterpreted the use of the phrase “specialty crops.”  The panel was making the point that the biggest farmers these days are not growing food for human consumption, for the most part they’re growing crops that are fed to livestock or used for ethanol production.  
The phrase “specialty crops” is how farmers refer to the kinds of things we see at farmers markets, i.e. things people actually eat.  The problem being that crops grown for human consumption shouldn’t be a “specialty” but rather the norm.
Rob- It’s hard to sell Bok Choy, Pearl Barley, and Hard Shell Gourds exclusively and raise a family/cover costs/and now pay more extravagant property taxes courtesy of the Williamson Act being taken away from us farmers.
Unfortunately, the first things to go are the specialty crops for most… The seed costs more, the yields don’t make up for it, and in the end, farming isn’t only a passion, it is also a business.
And yes, Corn is fed to livestock, which is fed to a majority of Humans.  
There are bigger problems out there..the threat to halt technological innovation in Agriculture.  Could you imagine living with computers from the 1950s… now what about our food supply?  That’s the way that Pollan and Schlosser want us to go…  And they want it via regulation rather than capitalistic ways.

USC women’s tennis coach Richard Gallien has been coaching tennis for more than 25 years.
He’s seen hundreds of players improve, mature and graduate.
Quite a few of his players have gone on to become head coaches themselves. But according to Gallien, he has never coached against one of his former players — until today.
The No. 17 USC women’s tennis team takes on No. 27 South Florida today at 1:30 p.m. at Marks Tennis Stadium.
The Bulls are coached by Agustin Moreno, who Gallien coached at Pepperdine in 1986.
“We talk all the time,” Gallien said of Moreno. “He’s a good friend of mine.”
Gallien said despite the friendship, both coaches have been keeping it serious.
“We’re both a little too tight for [smack talk],” Gallien said.
Adding to the seriousness is the cramped schedule of both teams.
South Florida is coming off a 5-2 loss at No. 2 Florida last Tuesday and will face San Diego on Sunday.
The Women of Troy swept San Diego State last Tuesday and will host Texas on Sunday.
With both teams playing three games in five days, there is no time to joke around.
“It’s a quick turnaround,” said sophomore Danielle Lao. “But we’re rested and ready.”
Gallien says he doesn’t expect his team to take the midweek match lightly.
“South Florida’s a very good team,” he said. “They’ve been consistently ranked about 25 in the country for the past three years or so. They have two ranked doubles teams, which is really hard to do.  It’ll be a good match.”
Although also USC has a pair of ranked doubles teams, it is an area Gallien feels his team needs to improve in.
“We didn’t play that well in doubles against San Diego State,” he said. “I think the girls will be extra motivated and excited to make amends.”
Despite their lackluster doubles performances, the Women of Troy did win their first match in a week and a half when they went against the Aztecs.
“It was a good win,” Gallien said. “It was good to get some momentum, and now we want to keep it going.”
Fans can help the team “keep the momentum” by showing up at Marks Stadium tomorrow afternoon.
Admission is free and there will be In-N-Out Burgers available for purchase.
The Women of Troy are 1-0 all-time against South Florida with their only other meeting coming in 1979 during the AIAW Nationals.

Sunday was an important day.
No, I’m not talking about the Super Bowl.
I’m referring to another game that occurred just down the street from the Staples Center.
For those of you who have no idea what I’m talking about: Yes, there actually was another game that took place at 1 p.m. that day.
It was the women’s basketball game between USC and No. 10 UCLA.
As I walked into the arena and looked around, I couldn’t help but notice the sea of cardinal filling up the Galen Center.
But it wasn’t the raucous crowd you’d normally see at a rivalry game such as this.
It was a sea of empty seats.
And among those seats were sections of baby blue.
That’s right — a bunch of UCLA students and fans came into USC’s house.
Not only did they come into our house, but they made their presence known.
They screamed, shouted and booed our Women of Troy, acting as if they owned the place.
To counter their awful eight-clap — silence.
To counter their sign-waving, their finger-pointing and their chanting — nothing.
USC students: UCLA students outclassed you.
Sure, the players’ parents were there for support, but you can’t expect them to be the only ones giving it their all for their own.
On the other hand, I traveled to Westwood for the first meeting between the two teams, and it was by far a different atmosphere in Pauley Pavilion.
UCLA students and fans packed the arena, and they were cheering, chanting and cursing the Women of Troy.
If I were a USC player, I would have felt I was playing in marked territory.
The game between the same two teams occurred Sunday — except this time, it was in USC territory.
You think Bruin fans would think twice before heading into the heart of downtown Los Angeles, but that clearly wasn’t the case on Sunday.
They knew what they were doing, and they had enough school pride (and guts) to come into the Galen Center and support their team.
The tough part about seeing the lack of student support is listening to one of your own acting as if this should be normal.
“I’ve been here for three years and that’s always how it’s been,” said junior guard Ashley Corral. “It sucks to come out on your home court and get booed.”
Unfortunately, that’s exactly the problem.
That’s where we, as students, are supposed to come in.
To see a home team get booed in their own arena is downright awful.
To have your crosstown rivals come into your own house and fill almost an entire section of the lower bowl is inexcusable.
And to let it happen without even putting up a fight is embarrassing.
We’re supposed to be a Trojan family.
It’s up to us, as students, to fight for our school and our team.
We help each other out, defend and support each other.
But that wasn’t the case Sunday.
I can probably count on both hands the number of USC students in the Galen Center Sunday afternoon — and that’s being generous.
Home-court advantage is crucial, no matter what sport you play.
The support of fans changes the whole dynamic of a game. A three-point basket or a home run can send the crowd into a frenzy and swing momentum back to the home team.
And in an important game that had large implications on USC’s conference seeding and its NCAA tournament hopes, having fans show up to this game would have meant everything.
But nobody showed up, nobody supported the Women of Troy and nobody was there to stand up and retaliate against those Bruins in baby blue.
So, my call to you, as students, is this: Show some more love for the women’s basketball team.
They still have a shot at making the NCAA tournament, and at this point in the season, they have a better record than their male counterparts.
I can guarantee you don’t have a problem showing up at the men’s basketball game, so why not show the same support for the women?
Don’t let your crosstown rivals, or any other opponents for that matter, think they can walk down here and act like they own our house.
Have some pride, don that cardinal and gold proudly and support your Women of Troy.

Actually there are four sports played at Galen Center: Men’s and women’s basketball and men’s and men’s and women’s volleyball.  Only men’s basketball has a respectable student turnout.  Even men’s volleyball, now ranked number 1, attracts very few students.
My wife and I attend nearly every game and match for all four sports.  As fans, and not parents, we have gotten to know the parents and regulars like ourselves.  We see the same group of dedicated fans at nearly every game.  It’s too bad we can’t say the same for the students.  If we can drive 45 miles round trip, several times a week, to support the teams you would think the students could walk across Figueroa to do the same thing.
I do have a suggestion.  Women’s basketball and men’s volleyball needs to take a lesson from the Women’s Volleyball team.  Several times during the season the fans in attendance are invited to the Kennedy Founders Room following the match to meet the team and coach.  Mr. Waters, the stadium announcer acts as master of ceremonies, interviewing members of the team and coach Mick Haley.   The post game events give the fans a real chance to meet the players and to get to know them.  If more fans actually knew the player perhaps the student attendance would increase.
Men’s Basketball could use a modified format by inviting fans to stay in the stands following the match.  The team members and coach O’Neill could come back into the stadium to be interviewed by Petros.  Think how interesting that would be.
The support for woman’s basketball has been down right lousy the last number of years. The games could be played in the Lyons Ctr. except for ucla and Stanford which would be a lot more of a home court advantage. The ‘ruin punk fans are obnoxious and ill mannered, and some football players are needed to stare them down when they come to Galen Ctr. What the heck are they doing sitting downstairs courtside when they should be in the rafters yelling to their heart’s content. Maybe the Athletic Dept. needs to look at a calendar to see when the Super Bowl is being played not to schedule a big rivalry game that same day . Starting even an hour earlier at noon would have helped to get people back to their homes in more than enough time before the 3:30pm kickoff.

A few weeks ago, the women’s basketball team looked like it was a lock to receive a bid to the NCAA tournament this March. It was tied for second place in the Pac-10 with a 4-1 conference record and only one of its four losses was against an unranked team.
New lift · Sophomore forward Christina Marinacci has started the past three games for USC, averaging 10 points and five rebounds. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Now, after losing four out of its past five games, the Women of Troy have a less than spectacular 13-8 record and are fifth in the Pac-10.
In ESPN’s latest tournament projections, USC is projected as a No. 9 seed. But the last update was before the Women of Troy’s 74-67 home loss to No. 9 UCLA.
Senior guard Jacki Gemelos scored 16 points to lead the Trojans against UCLA in the losing effort, converting four out of five of her three-point attempts.
“I let the game come to me, and took my shot when it was open,” Gemelos said. “I just want to continue to do that, not take anything out of character and hit my shots when I’m open.”
The close loss to the Bruins shouldn’t hurt the team’s chances too much, but letdowns against either Oregon or Oregon State this week would likely drop the Women of Troy into the bottom half of the Pac-10 standings.
For playing in a conference that only has two ranked teams, that is probably not good enough to make the NCAA tournament.
“This week is definitely going to be huge for us,” Gemelos said. “We need two wins down here, there’s no way to sugarcoat it.”
Oregon State (8-14, 1-10) is last in the Pac-10, but won its first game in the conference last week on the road against Washington. Before that, its last win was Dec. 21 against Eastern Washington.
The Beavers are led by freshman guard Alyssa Martin, who averages 14 points per game.
Earlier this season, the Women of Troy beat the Beavers 53-45 at home. Sophomore forward Christina Marinacci led all scorers in that game, scoring 14 points off the bench for the Trojans.
Now a starter for the Women of Troy, who suffered from sluggish starts this season, Marinacci will try to have that same type of positive impact against the Beavers on Thursday.
“On the bench, you get to pay more attention to how the referees are calling the game,” Marinacci said. “[But] I think I give us a spark [starting] with my rebounding and scoring.”
On Saturday, the Women of Troy will travel to Eugene toon Oregon’s new, forest-decorated court. Luckily for the Trojans, the Ducks (12-10, 3-8) haven’t been playing their best basketball lately, either. They have lost six of their last seven games.
But Oregon is 3-2 at home in conference games, and scores a Pac-10-leading 80.9 points per game. Fellow juniors Nia Jackson and Amanda Johnson are the two top scorers in the conference, averaging 17 and 16.7 points, respectively. Jackson also leads the Pac-10 in assists with 5.7 per game.
The Ducks complement their fast-paced offense by utilizing a full-court pressure defense, forcing 22.9 turnovers per game. They are second in the Pac-10 with 12.5 steals per game.
The two teams’ earlier matchup at the Galen Center went down to the wire, with the Women of Troy eking out a 79-76 victory.
The crucial two-game road trip starts Thursday at 7 p.m. against Oregon State and then continues at 2 p.m. Saturday against Oregon.
“We’re focusing on what we need to do,” Marinacci said. “Our biggest worry isn’t what [our opponents] do, it’s how we come out and play.”
“We know our ultimate goal [of making the tournament], and we want that really, really bad,” Gemelos said. “We’re going to play our hearts out and keep our eyes on the prize.”

Last season, senior forward Alex Stepheson struggled to stay on the floor.
He battled fitness issues, and picked up three or more fouls in 12 of the 28 games he appeared in.
When Stepheson sat on the bench last year, however, USC had the luxury of playing forward Leonard Washington for significant minutes.
Second win · Senior forward Alex Stepheson went through intense offseason workouts in order to improve his conditioning. The work has paid off thus far, as Stepheson is averaging career-highs in points and rebounds. -  Daily Trojan file photo 
This season, after Washington transferred to Wyoming, freshman forward Garrett Jackson is the only big man available to play major minutes off the bench.
USC coach Kevin O’Neill, knowing that he would not be able to afford to take Stepheson out of the game for long periods of time this season, encouraged him to get into better cardiovascular shape.
Stepheson spent the summer working with first-year strength and conditioning coach Shaun Brown.
Stepheson did yoga once a week, in addition to bike sprints, track workouts, lifting and some basketball drills.
“[Stepheson] was outstanding,” Brown said. “He did not miss a sprint, did not miss any reps, did not miss anything. You cannot ask for anything more than that.”
As a result of his improved conditioning, Stepheson has reduced his personal fouls from 2.4 last season to 2.0 per game and has only been called for more than three fouls in game once.
He increased his field goal percentage from .475 to .556 and his minutes per game are up to 33.0 from 25.8.
“Shaun Brown has been the MVP with Alex game-in and game-out,” O’Neill said. “Alex worked his tail off all summer long.”
Stepheson is averaging 9.8 points and 8.9 rebounds and he has had seven double-doubles this season.
“Shawn really got after me about getting into shape and eating right,” Stepheson said. “It definitely has paid off.”
The Trojans (12-11, 4-6) will be counting on Stepheson to have a big game when they host Oregon State tonight at 8:00 p.m.
The Beavers (9-13, 4-7) have momentum after upsetting No. 19 Washington a week ago, while USC has lost five of its last seven games since beating UCLA at home Jan. 9.
The Trojans have not played since last Wednesday when they lost at UCLA.
USC lost 80-76 at Oregon State on Jan. 15, despite 26 points and 14 rebounds from junior forward Nikola Vucevic.
In that game, USC trailed by as many as 16 points in the second half before making a late run.
The Beavers are led by sophomore guard Jared Cunningham, who averages 13.9 points per game.
He torched the Trojans in the teams’ first competition, scoring a career-high 24 points.

Israel comes out on top


To quote David Suissa, a Huffington Post contributor, “Israel’s Never Looked So Good.”
This week, the peoples of the Middle East erupted into social and political chaos.
Starting about two weeks ago, nearly one million people in Egypt protested their government, hoping the president would quit. According to the Wall Street Journal, around 150 were killed and more than 600 were wounded.
Just days ago, Jordan’s king fired his entire government and the Syrians planned a mass protest .
The Tunisians and Yemenis also protested their political leaders.
The Middle Eastern countries, besides Israel, finally got the message. Tyranny is out, and democracy is in. But the method of getting there is hostile and barbaric.
Today, the media is featuring the Mideast for its extreme immorality and turmoil. But what about most other days when those countries aren’t in the news? Even when the cameras aren’t rolling, these Arab countries’ leaders violate basic human rights on a daily basis.
These Arab countries strip gay people of their basic human right to peacefully live. Residents are stripped of religious freedom, and women are considered second-class citizens.
“While self-righteous Israel bashers have scrutinized every flaw in Israel’s democracy they kept their big mouths shut about the oppression of millions of Arabs throughout the Middle East,” Suissa wrote in his column.
Israel hosts the largest gay pride parade in the Middle East; it allows members of minority groups to serve as high-ranking members in the government, and residents from all over the world with diverse backgrounds and religions call Israel their home.
The world that for so long condemned Israel for being inhumane and unjust finally sees, out in the open, that it’s the surrounding Arab countries that have the problem with corruption and immorality.
So now like the rest of the Israel supporters, I bet you’re thinking, “Israel’s Never Looked So Good.”


Danielle Nisimov
Junior, Public Relations 


Which is why they call themselves a “Jewish State.” It is a theocracy, not a democracy…Many of Israel’s laws are based on interpretations of religious laws and doctrines. The leading political parties in Israel are religiously affiliated. You cannot call a country led by religious groups a “democracy.” It’s not. It is a theocracy.
Nope they are a democracy and they call themselves the Jewish state because it’s the homeland of the Jewish people for thousands of years and because Jews deserve a right like all other people to be safe and have a home for themselves.  That doesn’t mean that other minorities or any less though.  A theocracy by definition is one in which religious law is the law of the land, which is not the case in Israel.  Israel has a liberal constitution and equality for all minorities.  It even has affirmative action for minorities.  I think we’re all smart enough to realize that the 20 Muslim countries in the Middle East are actually theocracies and Israel, the only Jewish state, is not.
I now remember why I usually don’t read the DT. They publish bullshit like this…
The revolution in Egypt has been mostly peaceful–violence only broke out when pro-Mubarak thugs began launching violent attacks against the pro-democracy demonstrators. The Tunisian revolution was a “white revolution,” meaning there was little or no blood shed in the process. The protests in Yemen have not been violent either, and the changes in Jordan and Syria are not new, unique, or “barbaric.”
What IS barbaric is the fact that Israel continued to try to support Mubarak, even when millions of Egyptians wanted him out. Israel continued to support Mubarak, even when he carried out Israel and US-backed torture programs, when he abolished human rights in Egypt, when he allowed his people to starve and the country to fall into a state of poverty. ISRAEL SUPPORTED HIM. And Israel continues to support him. THAT is barbaric and absolutely disgusting.
Israel’s treatment of human trafficking victims within its borders is barbaric and horrendous. Israel’s treatment of Palestinian civilians is barbaric and internationally condemned. Israel’s use of torture and abuse of human rights is barbaric and again internationally condemned. Israel’s destruction of Palestinian homes and communities and way of life is barbaric.
Israel is not a democracy, despite the rhetoric you employ. And if this is the best Israel can look, it is a sad commentary on the reality of just how barbaric and awful their government is.
Hey genius the author was talking about violence on the part of the governments, not the people.  Learn to read a little more carefully.  And Israel is not supporting Mubarak, all it has said is that it wants the peace treaty to be honored no matter what happens.  It has a right to be worried that Islamist fundamentalists will take over, but it’s not supporting Mubarak at all. The only way Israel has “supported” Mubarak is to cooperate and have peace.  If you want to talk about countries that have “supported” Mubarak, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Britain, Russia, and the UAE all come way before Israel.  So I don’t understand this anger, except that I get the feeling you hate Israel so much you can’t contain and blame everything on the tiny little Jewish nation. 
On top of that, it’s really really funny that you call Israel barbaric when it treats its citizens, Arabs and Muslims included, better than Arab and Muslim countries treat their own people. Talk about irony!  If you had to rank the most barbaric countries in the Middle East, Israel would no doubt be dead last.  Actually, it wouldn’t even be on the list.  Funny what hateful propaganda does to people….
The only way for the people of the Middle East (all of Islam for that matter) to experience true democracy is to free themselves from the shackles of Islam.
Islam and democracy are incompatible and anyone who says Indonesia is an example they are simply showing just how dire Islamic democracies are.
Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Jordan, Oman, Syria, Lebanon, Sudan, Mauritania, Niger, Algeria, Somalia, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kirgizstan, etc…
Name one country from this or any list of Islamic dominated countries where one can freely criticize Islam, convert from Islam, proselytize for any other religion, draw pictures of Mohammed, criticize Saudi Arabia, openly practice homosexuality or Judaism, be a free woman with all this implies.
So please don’t blame Egypt’s problems on America. I would bet money that if America could foster true democracy in any Muslim country it would, just as it fostered freedoms and democracy in Germany and Japan after WWII.
Quit blaming their problems on anyone but them and their backwards-looking religion.
Finally, let me say, Mohammed was Islam’s first political leader. He refused to acknowledge a separation of mosque and state as Jesus did (Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s…). Mohammed was a theocratic despot who killed, raped, enslaved and pillaged his way to power and wealth.
This is who Muslims look to for direction, no? Not to America, but to Mohammed and therein lies the tale of the tape.
All revolutions are hostile and somewhat barbaric by nature. Think the American revolution.
Let’s let the Egyptian people decide what they want and not Israel or America.
What a pile…..
Isreal is one of the worst violators of human rights in the world. period.
What delusional world do you live in?
Great letter, and so true!

If you cast a ballot for the Undergraduate Student Government elections in the last few years, you were in the minority.
In 2010’s election for example, of the approximately 16,000 eligible undergraduate student voters, only about 4,550 turned up to the polls on campus or online.
Alan Wong | Daily Trojan
Overall, that’s less than one-third of the undergraduate student population.
Thirty three percent is actually quite high considering USC students’ general inability to muster up the energy to vote on anything.
Only 500 ballots were cast at USC’s sole on-campus polling station — Marks Tower — for the 2010 midterm elections.
When I visited the same location last summer for the primaries, a beleaguered high school volunteer named Jessica informed me  with the weary aplomb of someone who had been there since five that morning that only half a dozen voters had filtered through during the day, and not all students.
But the issue at hand is not political turnout.
In the next few days, USC students have a chance to concretely affect the way their collegiate experience unfolds — not through state or national politics, but through the local student government.
USG has taken upon itself the commendable, if Sisyphean, battle of raising voter turnout this year to 6,000 voters.
Let’s hope the student body can be roused from its apathy.
Part of the problem might be a general misconception about what USG actually does.
Many of us climbed the academic ranks through the kind of elementary and high schools where adding vending machines were student government pipe dreams, and candidates announced their goals with acrostics.
To contrast: This year’s presidential cabinet and senate successfully lobbied for an extra day of Thanksgiving break.
They worked to improve the notoriously spotty USC wireless coverage.
They organized school sponsored excursions to Los Angeles hot spots, such as the beach and Universal City Walk.
Past USG initiatives have introduced the free trams to L.A. Live, extended Lyon Center hours to midnight, and even helped to decide the food choices in the Tutor Campus Center.
Lest you worry that I’m hidden somewhere in the organization’s payroll, I’ll be the first to admit that USG has its flaws.
There have been good presidents, there have been mediocre presidents, there have been presidents who have prompted incendiary editorials from this newspaper that included metaphors about dogs peeing on the carpet.
But that’s all up to the voters. The ones who show up will determine if next year will see a presidential ticket that has its thumb on the pulse of the student body.
Some have raised questions about a decidedly high Greek presence in USG.
Greek students accounted for 43 percent of the vote in last year’s election — an amazing feat considering the Greek system makes up only about a fifth of the student body.
For better or for worse, those students over on 28th Street know better than anyone how to mobilize — if only the rest of the student population could follow suit.
So in the coming weeks, it’s time for students to take a few minutes out of their day to familiarize themselves with the presidential and senatorial candidates.
The Daily Trojan will be running profiles this week, and the USG website also provides information.
Industrious students can attend can even stop to talk to the hoard of canvassers on Trousdale.
And finally, well informed students should vote online or in person. It’s easier to be cynical, but more important to play an active role in your next year of college.

I don’t even know how many times in my academic career a teacher has complained to me about how incredibly horrible my handwriting was on in-class writing assignments.
For more than 20 years I have had to put up with professors telling me things like “Your essay was completely illegible” or “You need to practice your handwriting.”
Julia Vann| Daily Trojan
One time I even read this on an essay: “Didn’t even bother with this one.”
I’m tired of having my professors disregard the content of my essays and instead focus on the way in which I translate my thoughts onto paper, and I’m sure I’m not alone.
It is time that USC takes a proactive role in solving this problem.
If students are allowed to use a word processing program when writing in-class essays, both students and professors would benefit.
I can already see the USC administration reacting to this suggestion with some skepticism.
Laptops are cheating machines, right?
If students are able to use their laptops on a test, what is to stop them from going on the internet to look up key points for their essay?
What prevents a student from having a cheat sheet already typed up on a word document.
Even better, what prevents the student from having the essay already written beforehand?
The answer lies in computer surveillance.
At my high school, every school-owned computer had a video surveillance program installed on it.
The program allowed the teacher to view the activities of the class by simply logging onto the “main computer,” which was usually the teacher’s personal  laptop.
If USC purchases a surveillance program such as “SpectorSoft,” the program my high school uses, professors would be able to administer in-class writing assignments via computer without worrying about cheating. 
Let’s face it, handwriting is dead.
With each advancing day, the written form is becoming more and more irrelevant in the computer-based society we live in.
In an article in the Washington Post, Margaret Webb Pressler reports cursive is slowly being eradicated from elementary school curriculums.
What is taking its place? Typing. USC can be the first school to take this idea one step further.
If students were able to type their in-class essays, the quality of the work would increase because it would be easier to edit and organize.
And according to today’s youth, we can even type a lot faster than they can write.
This tactic would also allow students to interact more with their professors and take advantage of new opportunities.
Once a student finishes writing an essay, the student’s written work can be easily sent to the professor.
This process gives students the ability to interact directly with their professor.
Then, once each essay has been graded, the professor can send their personal comments to each student.
More importantly, this new test-taking plan can help out the Earth.
USC can do its part to help Mother Earth get back on her feet.
By converting its current test administering strategy,    — trash-pile-friendly blue books — into this new, strictly computer-based testing policy, our university would be moving in the right direction.
If in-class essay writing became 100 percent digital, there would be no reason to ever purchase a tree-wasting blue book ever again.
It is going to take more than one article to change the way USC administers its tests, but a looming question remains.
Why are students allowed to use their computers to write out- of-class essays, but are restricted from using them to complete in-class assignments?
If this policy can be reformed to meet the current needs of students, then we will surely be better off moving forward.
As a leading private research university, we need to employ the cutting edge technology ­— fit for our times — in the classroom.
Let’s catch up with the times, and make computers available in class just as much as they are outside of it.
After all, shouldn’t we be allowed the same luxuries in class as we are out of the classroom?
David Morris is a sophomore majoring in English (creative writing.)
nevermind, are you suggesting everyone install the software on their laptop? there’s a way to make sure every student installed the software?
having a computer for every student in every classroom is not practical. very expensive expenditure. besides, even though you’re saving trees, you’re creating a lot of e-waste and using up electricity.
suck it up and write better. what are you, 3?
Good idea. I’ve always thought the same.
This is coming from an English major?!?  So you just openly admitted that you’re good at absolutely nothing…*applause*

Concert of the Week:
Mountain Man with The Decemberists
  
 Speciliazing in three layer vocal harmonies that are both sensual and haunting at once and accompanied only by the occasional guitar notes, Mountain Man stands uniquely apart from the online buzz machine. The songs, some of which are disarmingly short, sound interesting on paper but are meant to be heard live in the stunning resonance of an intimate theater.
Song of the Week:
“Under Cover of Darkness” – The Strokes
If Julian Casablancas’s recent hinting of a large paycheck behind the reunion of The Strokes was troubling, the New York quintet’s first single since 2006 might help quash fears of a half-hearted come back. “Under Cover of Darkness” is the first released track off the band’s upcoming fourth LP Angles and is currently available for streaming at thestrokes.com.
The song begins with a pair of crisp, dueling guitars from Albert Hammond Jr. and Nick Valensi, sonically recalling the smokey heights of “Room On Fire.” Casablancas is as cynical as ever, crooning “I been all around this town, everybody’s singing the same song for ten years.” Hammond Jr.’s guitar solo drives the number home to a raucous finish.
As a whole, “Under Cover of Darkness” is no “Hard to Explain” or “Reptilia,” but its labored sounds indicate a band that has slipped back into its dancing shoes with relative ease.
Event of the Week:

Sunday – 5 p.m.
Whether you’re in a long term relationship already or looking to take yours to Sheena-esque realms of passion, the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association (GLAZA) has the ultimate Valentine’s Day event for couples.
The second annual edition of Sex and the City Zoo 2 will take place this Sunday at 5 p.m. in the zoo’s Witherbee Auditorium.
The adults only event will feature a saucy spread of desserts and drinks, compliments of Whole Foods Markets and Herzog Wine Cellars, as well as a lasciviously worded lecture by zoo public relations director Jason Jacobs on the etiquette of mating in the animal kingdom. Jacobs will place particular emphasis on the benefits of staying single versus hooking up in the bush.
Tickets for Sex and the City Zoo 2 are $25 for GLAZA members and $35 for non-members. A portion of the proceeds will benefit the zoo’s current wildlife preservation and conversation projects.
Screening of the Week:
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
Sunday & Monday  – 8 p.m.
 
Arclight Hollywood will be hosting a series of pro- and anti-Valentine’s Day films throughout the weekend. Michel Gondry’s romantic masterpiece Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is slated to play at 8 p.m. this Sunday and Monday night.
It’s difficult to decide which category Gondry’s film falls into. The idea of a broken couple (Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet) having their memories of each other surgically erased is cruelly tragic. And yet, Gondry takes his leads upon a psychological journey so thoughtfully photographed, written and acted that the story takes on Rilkean dimensions in spirituality and affection.
 

 
 

Only the hard-hearted will leave this one with dry eyes. Whether the tears well from a place of despair or amorous warmth, Gondry’s picture ranks among the greatest films of the past decade and the most powerfully filmed love stories of our time. See it in the immersive space of a theater while you have the chance.

Jacks N Joe isn’t named after either a Jack or a Joe.
An all-day breakfast restaurant opened in December 2010 by Mark and Vianney Bednorz at the intersection of Adams Boulevard and Figueroa street, Jacks N Joe is short for “flapjacks and cups of joe.”
Pancake paradise · Jacks N Joe offers creatively titled items such as the “WTF?!” pancakes, one of the most popular dishes on the menu. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
“Jacks N Joe is like our home. We welcome you to our dining room as our guest,” Mark said. “We want to provide a place where you can feel welcome to hang out.”
The interior certainly fits that philosophy. Mark, a USC alumnus with an architecture degree, designed the restaurant to exude neighborhood coziness.
Jacks N Joe offers lots of sun, air, fresh flowers and personal touches like dog portraits and casual breakfast bars.
Jacks N Joe is a family business. Mark and Vianney are the nominal owners, but every family member helps out with restaurant’s usual  day-to-day tasks.
Their daughter Isabelle is “restaurant-schooled” by Vianney and always present.
Their son Julian, a USC senior majoring in architecture, pops by every now and then to assist.
Vianney’s sister Jasmine Lymon, a professional chef, mans the kitchen. Her cousins and niece help out frequently. Even Julian’s girlfriend pitches in as a server.
But the people who really make Jacks N Joe tick, the Bednorzes say, are the customers.
On any given weekday, they seat the USC swim team after its morning work out, the USC volleyball team in the afternoon and the USC baseball team in the evening.
“You see those girls right there?” Vianney pointed to a group of young women chatting by the window. “They’re the [USC] water polo team.”
But Trojans aren’t the only ones rejoicing to find a haven at Jacks N Joe.
The Bednorzes reported that occasionally the nuns from the local convent would brunch at Jacks N Joe and several long-time residents are already regulars.
“The neighbors who grew up here come and thank us for giving them something different,” Mark said. “They tell us most places around here are just commercialized fast food chains.”
Jacks N Joe was an idea the Bednorzes had for Julian’s school project on a local business proposal, which they decided to adopt as their own. In April 2010, the Bednorzes finally made the decision to materialize this dream.
“As a design-builder, I have built every other person’s dreams: their dream home, dream office and dream buildings,” Mark said.
“Well, this is our dream. The toughest decision for us was to not follow it. We only live once, and we didn’t want to spend the rest of our lives thinking, ‘What if. . .’”
Although the leasing process for Jacks N Joe was unusually swift and smooth — it took the Bednorzes only eight months as opposed to the typical year to open a restaurant — there were still bumps in the road once it opened.
On the first weekend since the grand opening, Jacks N Joe saw more than 150 customers lined out the door.
“It was a madhouse,” Vianney said. “We weren’t ready at all. We didn’t know how many people to staff, how many products to buy, how much to prep. We really showed our inexperience as restaurant people.”
But their success was as exacting as it was surreal.
“Normally I’m this high-pressure, crazy guy,” Mark said. “But that crazy day, when everything was going wrong, I just stepped back and thought, ‘Wow, this is cool.’”
That day, the Bednorzes got a lesson they will never forget.
“It wasn’t a failure,” Mark said. “We’re not by any means perfect, but we learned so much that one day. The next crazy weekend, we knew what we were doing.”
Indeed, now every weekend is a “crazy weekend” for the Bednorzes.
They didn’t do any marketing, but word about Jacks N Joe’s unique atmosphere and menu has spread across the community.
The “WTF?!” pancakes, misshapen pancakes with sweet cream cheese and berries, always draw a laugh from the customers.
For the Bednorzes, there is nothing better than making a simple change in someone’s day even if it is just a funny plate of pancakes.
“While Jacks N Joe was still being built, I would sit right here, imagining a group of USC students over there laughing,” Mark said. “And I would imagine them bringing their friends and parents here. Then I would also imagine the downtown people coming here for meetings. It’s so neat to see it play out before my eyes.”

The government doesn’t always get it right.
I’m no Tea Partier, but it’s true: the government doesn’t always make the right calls on the important issues of our time. This is often the case when it comes to food legislation, which has largely been hit-and-miss over the years.
That’s not to say that the USDA’s achievements in the past have been futile. It has done much to keep consumers safe and aware of the risks and problems that come from eating certain foods such as meat.
If you were thinking of feasting on a romantic meal of organic ribeye fed with natural grown feed this Valentine’s Day,  however, you might want to take advantage of that opportunity sooner rather than later, especially after a recent move by the USDA that might make such products difficult to find in a few years.
Last month, the USDA deregulated the use and planting of genetically modified alfalfa. Alfalfa is a widespread crop in America, used largely as feed for livestock, like cattle.
A new roundup-spray resistant seed is at the heart of the debate about the deregulation.
Many farmers advocated for the genetically modified alfalfa seed, arguing it was a matter of cost and convenience.
And like many GMOs, the benefits of planting  the modified alfalfa seed are obvious: higher yields, greater resistance to infection and  lower food costs.
But now some experts are raising their objections alongside those of organic farmers who have protested the USDA’s move, stating that the deregulated planting of roundup-ready alfalfa might lead to cross-contamination, ultimately leading to an inability for organic farmers to grow a pure product on pure soil.
Tom Vilsack, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, reassured organic farmers, stating that measures would be taken to prevent cross-contamination. He promised  $1 million toward research and also proposed increased research into the subject.
But many are unconvinced and are preparing for an unstoppable spread of GM alfalfa across America.
“Some degree of cross-pollination will occur regardless of what mechanism is going to be put in place,” Jeff Wolt, an agronomist at Iowa State University told the Associated Press.
But there are other, more sinister problems that can arise from eliminating regulation and safeguards.
The growth of herbicide and pesticide resistant weeds is one problem. The list, unfortunately, goes on.
It seems that, for all its might, the USDA slipped up in forging ahead with the deregulation deal without considering, or planning for, the potential of destroying the livelihoods of organic alfalfa farmers.
The uncontrolled spread of genetically modified alfalfa could severely restrict the ability of organic farmers to find good land with pure soil distanced from the modified alfalfa fields.
Frederick Kirschenmann, who works at the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University, knows this for a fact. He manages a farm and noted that there needed to be two miles between fields to reduce the chance of cross-contamination.
Unfortunately, he had to give up growing organic canola about a decade ago, after Roundup Ready canola seeds became a big contender in the seed market.
“So much Roundup Ready came into the area, there was no way to find a way to put in a field that was at least two miles from a field with the GMO crop,” Kirschenmann said.
And so it appears that history is set to repeat itself. Vilsack, of course, will continue to pledge efforts to prevent contamination of pure seed stock and pure fields. But for now, the deregulation of genetically modified alfalfa remains.
As of today, the USDA has not yet come up with a comprehensive plan to protect organic crops and their farmers.

Just like in the ’80s, when classic rock faded away and hip-hop swooped in, the second floor of the Grammy Museum, previously occupied by an exhibit entitled “Strange Kozmic Experience” that featured classic rock artists such as Jimi Hendrix, now features a new installation entitled “Hip-Hop: A Cultural Odyssey.”
Renee Cohn | Daily Trojan
The exhibit, based on the large, photo- and essay-heavy coffee table style book of the same name, focuses not only on hip-hop music, but also on hip-hop as an all-encompassing artistic and cultural movement. It accomplishes this by featuring artifacts and information about the four main elements of hip-hop: DJing, MCing, b-boy/break dancing and graffiti.
The exhibit also features hip-hop fashion from different eras. There’s an entire wall filled with Jordan sneakers, one pair for each year since their 1984 invention. Everlast even donated a wall of sneakers from his presumably enormous private collection to demonstrate hip-hop’s strong ties to fashion culture, especially sneaker fashion.
The most intimate artifacts the exhibit displays are original, handwritten lyric sheets from 2Pac, Eminem, Wyclef Jean and Eazy-E. 2Pac’s lyrics include an intriguing sketch of a gun shooting a microphone, while Eminem’s lyric sheet is filled with scribbles and scratched out phrases. Eazy-E’s sheet, however, is legible and neat, which is somewhat ironic because of the violent and obscene nature of the lyrics.
Also on display from the late Eazy is his signature blue Carhartt suit and Compton hat worn in the video for N.W.A.’s “100 Miles and Runnin’.” That outfit can be found in the West Coast hip-hop case, right next to one of Snoop Dogg’s black jackets.
The exhibit also features interactive materials, such as digital turntables for users to scratch and samplers for museumgoers to make beats.
All of these artifacts and many more were unveiled during a party at the museum Tuesday night, featuring legendary DJ Afrika Bambaataa.
Since the event was about hip-hop, it was easy to spot the celebrities in the building, as the party’s host would get on the microphone in true MC fashion and yell things like “Mike Tyson is in the house!” Among the many celebrities in attendance, besides the Iron Mike, were early hip-hop legends Busy Bee, DJ Jazzy Jeff and Kool Keith.
Busy Bee even gave a short performance to the crowd, performing hits like 1987’s “Suicide” and ad-libbing lyrics about the party.
“Rap is something we do, hip-hop is something we live,” Busy Bee said between songs, as part of a rant about how hip-hop is unfairly criticized.
Going along with that speech, the theme of the party and exhibit was “peace, love, unity and having fun,” a reference to the song “Unity” by Afrika Bambaataa and James Brown, whose daughters were also in attendance.
“That’s the culture of hip-hop,” Busy Bee said.
After Busy Bee’s short set, his former collaborator and main draw of the event, Afrika Bambaataa, manned the turntables.
Much like the numerous artifacts in the exhibit, Bambaataa himself is a piece of history. He’s one of the genre’s original DJs, and his Universal Zulu Nation is a group that promotes positivity and “unity” in youth in an effort to dispel gang violence.
As Bambaataa spun classic hip-hop records, the free drinks had the party attendees loosening up and dancing to his mixes.
The whole scene was reminiscent of the hip-hop history that the museum is currently honoring. Though the backdrop of downtown Los Angeles and the waiters passing around fancy hors d’oeuvres didn’t exactly mirror what things were like in the Bronx in the early ’80s, it still gave some insight into what things must’ve been like when Bambaataa was throwing those original hip-hop parties.
At one point  during the night, two LAPD officers showed up, equipped with giant night sticks. Had this been a hip-hop party in Los Angeles 15 or so years ago, an officer’s appearance at a gathering filled with people wearing N.W.A.-honoring “Compton” hats would probably not have ended well.
Tuesday night’s officers, however, seemed more interested in Bambaataa’s performance and the numerous famous faces around them rather than in causing or stopping any trouble.
If the relatively calm presence of the police is any testament, hip-hop is no longer cast off as a lower, dangerous art form, but praised as the cultural odyssey that the museum intends to display.
“Hip-Hop: A Cultural Odyssey” will remain at the Grammy museum until May 4.

Last night’s presidential debate gave USG presidential candidates Monish Tyagi, Eric Burse and Alex Fadil the opportunity to make their voices heard at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Yet a surprising amount of students were not even aware that such an event took place last night, despite campaign posters that have been in place around campus.
“I didn’t even know there was an election coming up,” said Rachel Margolis, a freshman majoring in international relations.
Those that did the debate, however, seemed to get a lot out of it.
“I thought it was a very high level debate with well-prepared and highly-qualified candidates,” said Jeffrey Watson, a senior majoring in public relations.
Some students were excited to hear the candidate’s new ideas.
“I’m really happy I went because it gave me the opportunity to not only hear the platforms of the different candidates but also their responses on how they would actually be able to implement them,” said Catherine Sutcliff, an undeclared freshman. “It was super interesting just to hear all their ideas for next year.”
