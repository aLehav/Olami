The Lab Gastropub, located across from campus on Figueroa Street, has long been known for its cuisine and casual ambiance. What it isn’t known for is providing students a place to hear the best local bands Los Angeles has to offer. But with its new Live at The Lab summer music series, The Lab and USC Hospitality is trying to change that.
The brainchild of Michele Zaccone, senior manager of restaurants for USC Hospitality, Live at The Lab brings a new local artist or band to perform at The Lab every Thursday this summer. The idea for the series came from Zaccone’s experiences performing in the occasionally perilous Los Angeles music scene.
“Having played the Hollywood circuit, a lot of major venues make you ‘pay to play’ as an original artist and I wanted to create a platform to showcase their talent without those barriers,” Zaccone said in a press release from USC Hospitality. “My hope is for Live at The Lab to be a sought after location for local artists as a venue to perform build a foundation and impact the music scene in [Downtown Los Angeles].”
Thursday marked the first installation in the series and featured performances by singer-songwriters Melia Scaletty at 8 p.m. and RoseBud at 9 p.m.
The setup itself wasn’t especially extravagant. Performers played outside at The Lab’s patio level and were lit by a few small lights. In addition, their performances were fed through a small mixer or PA system through two small speakers. Although occasionally the levels weren’t great and speakers would crackle or feedback, this seemed more like growing pains that the people working on the series will eventually fix.
Immediately, it seemed like the performers were more of a background element for patrons of The Lab. While each artist had a few friends in attendance, most people seemed to have come to The Lab of their own accord and the sound system was not loud to the point of being disruptive. Scaletty performed first, armed with a keyboard and a beautiful, clearly well-trained voice. Her set felt like a standard singer-songwriter setup, with a few originals and a lot of covers, such as Neil Young’s “Heart of Gold” and Bob Marley’s “Waiting in Vain,” which she managed to keep interesting by transposing the tunes to piano.
Following Scaletty was RoseBud, who substituted Scaletty’s keyboard for accompaniment from a man playing guitar and adding vocal harmonies. RoseBud’s bluesier voice and the slight difference in setup made the act feel unique, but not so different that it would seem jarring to audience members. RoseBud’s set was constructed similarly to Scaletty’s, with a few originals peppered in with covers like John Legend’s “All of Me,” Foo Fighters’ “Big Me” and Ella Fitzgerald’s “Dream a Little Dream of Me.” Overall, both acts made for charming additions to The Lab’s general ambiance.
The Lab is currently fully booked for May and June, and is currently booking acts for dates in July and August. In the future, The Lab is planning on hosting a Jazz Night on May 26 and Brie Goldsoble and Lola Rhodes on June 16.  Student-musician Lani Renaldo will perform on June 23 and  artist Alex Nestler will play a show on June 30. Among other performers who will make appearances are alternative bands Alchemy Heroes and Darklung. These acts are all local artists in L.A.’s thriving music community. There is no cover fee and the seating is on a first come, first serve basis.

The USC Thornton School of Music and the Los Angeles Philharmonic brought some of the best classical musicians together for the Piatigorsky International Cello Festival, a ten-day music festival from May 13 to May 22 that showcased talent from all around the world.
The festival brought various events and workshops to both the Walt Disney Concert Hall and USC’s campus, kicking off with an inaugural performance by world-renowned cellist Ralph Kirshbaum, the artistic director of the festival. He also serves as the chair of the strings department and the Gregor Piatigorsky Chair in violoncello at the Thornton School of Music. Other events ranged from concerts from the L.A. Phil, Baroque Conversations, lunch series, Colburn Celebrity Recitals, master classes, workshops and more.
On Sunday, USC hosted the Cello Festival’s Gala Opening Concert at Bovard Auditorium with a wide array of musicians. Among the performers were Cello Duello, a cello duo from Germany, and Giovanni Sollima, a cellist and composer from Italy. Later in the evening was a performance of cellist Antonio Lysy’s Te Amo Argentina.
Te Amo Argentina is a multimedia act that includes cello performance, dance, film and visuals that all explore themes of Argentinian culture, with Lysy bringing the audience on a journey through the country’s past. Also gracing the stage for Te Amo Argentina were ballroom dancers Miriam Larici and Leonardo Barrionuevo, who wowed the audiences with their effortless dance moves and gravity-defying stunts while performing various tango pieces along with Lysy.
Following the USC Gala Opening Concert was one of the Colburn Celebrity Recitals at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, where Grammy Award-winning cellist Yo-Yo Ma was accompanied by pianist Kathryn Stott. The performance featured various pieces from many different composers that left the crowd on their feet. Other standouts of the festival included a dramatic and beautiful performance Wednesday night in Bovard Auditorium by Argentinian cellist Sol Gabetta, who was accompanied by pianist Kevin Fitz-Gerald, which ended with an encore performance that shined as bright as Sol. Later that evening was an intense second act with David Geringas, a Lithuanian cellist who previously won the Gold Medal at the International Tchaikovsky Competition and studied under Mstislav Rostropovich, one of the greatest cellists of all time.
Geringas appeared the following night for the Evening Concerto Concert in Bovard Auditorium, featuring cellists Li-Wei Qin and Raphael Wallfisch, conductor Uriel Segal, and the USC Thornton Chamber Singers and Wind Ensemble for a full and lively night. One of the most memorable pieces came from Li-Wei Qin, who performed Gulda’s Concerto for Cello and Wind Orchestra. The piece featured the full wind ensemble as well as electric bass and guitar, which was a breath of fresh air amidst a week of almost all classical pieces, many of which only featured piano and cello.
After a week full of concertos, sonatas, master classes and unforgettable performances, the Piatigorsky Cello Festival concluded with the Beethoven Gala Closing Concert in Bovard Auditorium on Sunday night. Cellists included some of the world’s best players, including Ronald Leonard, Laurence Lesser, Thomas Demenga, Colin Carr, Matt Haimovitz, Mischa Maisky, Andrew Shulman and Jean-Guihen Queyras, who performed many of the masterpieces composed by Beethoven for cello and piano. The festival was a reminder of the power of music and its ability to bring together an international community to celebrate the beauty of the violoncello.

Amber Miller has been named the 22nd dean of the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, Provost Michael Quick announced in a memorandum issued Wednesday.
Miller, who has served as the dean of science at Columbia University since 2011, will also hold the Anna Bing Dean’s Chair. She succeeds Steve Kay, who served as dean of Dornsife from 2012 to 2015 before leaving to become president of the Scripps Research Institute. Former Vice Dean of Dornsife Dani Byrd has served as interim dean since Dec. 1.
Miller was one of three candidates selected as finalists by a 12-member advisory search committee led by Quick and Dean Avishai Sadan of the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry.
“After an extensive national search for a new dean to carry on the school’s legacy of excellence, we found Professor Miller to be highly qualified to lead Dornsife College as it continues to advance its already-outstanding scholarship and influence,” Quick said in his memorandum.
The other two candidates for dean were Christopher Celenza, vice dean for humanities and social sciences at Johns Hopkins University, and Ray Jayawardhana, dean of science and a professor of physics and astronomy at York University in Canada. Both Celenza and Jayawardhana spoke on campus about their qualifications and vision for the school this past April.
Miller, who has also worked as a professor of physics, received her B.A. from University of California, Berkeley and her Ph.D. from Princeton University. She has been on staff at Columbia since 2002, served as the chief science advisor to the New York Police Department Counterterrorism Bureau for two years and is a fellow of the American Physical Society.
“Please join President Nikias and me in warmly congratulating Professor Miller on her appointment and in welcoming her, her husband Jonathan T. D. Neil and their daughter Brienne, to the Trojan Family,” Quick said. “We all look forward to their arrival this summer.”

Researchers at the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC have discovered that the UV radiation Resistance Associated Gene could help prevent the onset of the skin cancer melanoma in high-risk individuals in a study that was conducted earlier this month. Lead researcher and associate professor Chengyu Liang and her team published their findings in Molecular Cell on May 19 during Melanoma/Skin Cancer Detection and Prevention Month.
The study found that UVRAG is heavily involved in a cell’s repair process following exposure to UV radiation. Proteins scan for impaired DNA and tag the gene to repair lesions. The expression of this gene is also directly related to survival rates and the metastasis of the cancer.
“The higher the UVRAG, the better the survival rate, and the slower the tumor progression,” Liang said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “The UV-protecting function of UVRAG allows the cells to repair UV-induced DNA damage efficiently, reducing the UV-induced genetic instability, thereby protecting against skin cancer.”
The UVRAG gene was discovered almost 20 years ago, but until the study conducted by USC researchers, the biological pathway, expression and function of the gene was unknown.
The study found that individuals with mutated versions of the gene will be more susceptible to melanoma, which is the deadliest type of skin cancer, claiming the lives of 10,130 people annually, according to the American Cancer Society.
“Without UVRAG or when UVRAG is reduced, the core machinery involved in damage repair cannot assemble efficiently, instead rather idle apart, leaving many damage unfixed,” Liang said. “Accumulation of such unfixed DNA errors increases the genetic instability, highly increasing the risk of melanoma and other skin cancer.”
The study compared the repaired damage of the normal UVRAG to mutated versions in melanoma cells and 50 fly eyes. After injecting the cells with UV radiation, they discovered that the normal gene repaired approximately twice as much damage as the mutated gene.
USC researchers also collaborated with the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. The study was funded by The Margaret Early Trustee Foundation, American Cancer Society, National Institutes of Health Grants and GRL Program from the National Research Foundation of Korea.
This study provides a starting point for future drugs that could stimulate the repair mechanism of the gene for those who are at a high risk for melanoma. Liang says it can also be a helpful indicator for preventative measures.
“In the age of precision medicine, doctors may suggest their patients who have risks of skin cancer (such as skin cancer family history, super sensitive to sunlight, etc.) to screen this sunscreen gene and suggest those who have reduced levels of UVRAG or mutant version to protect more against sun exposure, such as lathering on more sunscreen with higher SPF and cover up more in summer, reducing outdoor activities in straight sunlight for long time, etc.,” Liang said.

Codesmith, a coding bootcamp based in Los Angeles, is making it easier than ever for USC students and alumni to get the skills required to start careers in computer science and software engineering.
The company recently announced a $4,300 scholarship exclusively for USC students to attend one of their coding bootcamps. CTO Will Sentance said that the scholarship is another part of Codesmith’s initiative to make hard skills such as coding easier for people who didn’t necessarily study computer science or engineering in college, but want to get started in those fields.
“I’ve always felt that it’s an injustice that your destiny, your life chances, are sort of set for you by 18,” Sentance said. “You could be 25, you could be 30, but if you did not get on the right track at 18, it’s very hard to go, ‘Now I want to achieve my dreams and become a software engineer.’”
The 12-week program primarily focuses on teaching full-stack JavaScript and preparing participants for careers in software engineering, according to its website. However, alumni of the program have found that those are not the only skills they have left with.
Jenna Davis, who graduated from USC in 2014 with a degree in psychology, said that the team-based exercises in the program between a “driver” who types out the code and a “navigator” who tells the code to the “driver” was extremely helpful in developing her communication skills.
“Communication is a super, super important part of being a successful coder and understanding what’s going on,” Davis said. “It’s not just about google-searching and copy-and-pasting stuff. It’s a huge, huge part of the learning process.”
According to Sentance, the scholarship is a result of the success USC students and alumni have had in the program.
“We put a huge weight on people being committed to giving back to their community, and we’ve been very impressed by the USC candidates for their willingness to mentor others, give back to the community and carry forward the values that were instilled in them at USC,” Sentance said.
Aaron Peltz, an alumnus of the class of 2009 who studied business administration, said that while he thought the Codesmith program was already extremely beneficial, the scholarship will make the bootcamp even more appealing for students.
“I thought Codesmith was a good option for someone who may come from a different background who wants a really aggressive program to expedite a transition into another industry without the scholarship,” Peltz said. “So the fact that there is a scholarship available makes it that much more compelling for people who are considering it.”
Davis agreed, saying that the scholarship will help those who couldn’t have afforded to attend Codesmith in the past.
“I think it’s a major opportunity,” Davis said. “I wish it were available for me. It’s not cheap, entering one of these bootcamps, but I think that if you really want to do it and you’re passionate about it, then finances shouldn’t stay in your way.”

In high school, the highest GPA meant an Ivy League bound student and emanated an air of success and competency. SAT and ACT scores were constantly compared for the sake of egos and validation. When seniors finally graduate from high school, they repeat the education cycle as freshmen in college the following fall. The general assumption is that the pressure, the competition and the tiresome nights of cram sessions would subside once students enter their respective universities. It’s actually  quite the opposite. If anything, it’s just as bad as it was in high school.
The preconceived idea has been that if one works hard in high school then he or she is able to be more relaxed in college. However, the intensity of academia only accelerates upon a student’s arrival at university. Students give it their all — taking the maximum units required and trying to achieve the 4.0 GPA they once had the prior year in high school. Countless hours and sleepless nights are no big deal and sometimes even revered by peers.
In a Huffington Post article, broadcast and digital journalism major senior Brad Streicher explains that. “college students always seem impressed when one of their sleepy counterparts brags of a restless week or a 4 a.m. bedtime made possible thanks to copious caffeine levels.” He gives perspective on the matter, describing that the praise students hand off to one another for sleepless nights and unhealthy habits is more upsetting than commendable.
As the hours of sleep get smaller, the bragging rights go up. The glorification of the number of clubs, internships and job offers one may have, in addition to their academic work is counterproductive to a student’s mental health. This  way of thinking only perpetuates the idea that someone’s worth is dependent on the intensity of their college experience.
This superior mentality might have successfully gotten a student into his or her top dream school, but continuing this superior outlook will only be destructive in the long run. Studies show that beginning in high school, kids are already prone to anxiety, depression and stress. An Education News survey given showed that 67 percent of high school students were stressed about homework, tests and college admissions. Upon entering university, students are faced with an elevated level of anxiety, as mental health becomes even more compromised.
Sleep is a heavy contributor to a student’s ultimate emotional well-being.  Increased insomnia was correlated to increased anxiety and depression in one study conducted by the University of North Texas. Mental health among university students is sometimes regarded as secondary; a student will oftentimes focus on their studies before they pay attention to their feelings.  University of York reported that half of ambulance calls made by students were in regards to suicide or self harm attempts related to pressure from school. By choosing to put energy into destructive habits, it results in the deterioration of one’s mental well-being.
College is such a pivotal time for a student’s self-growth and awareness. It is not a time to stay up consecutively for countless hours and then brag about it. If anything, students should be bragging about how much sleep they did get and how much self-care they’ve been doing. Students should also be paying attention to their stress and anxiety levels because academic performance can be and usually is supported by one’s mental health. Ultimately, it’s okay to be competitive, but it’s crucial to be mindful.

As the battle over legislating gender identity in bathrooms plays out on the national stage via a highly publicized photo by conservative UCLA students, the issue of transgender exclusion in bathrooms is a heated one.
In North Carolina, public schools face looming threats in the wake of the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, a bathroom bill signed in late March that mandates that those in government buildings use the bathroom that matches their assigned sex at birth rather than their preferred gender identity. When administrators at the University of North Carolina  met to discuss the infamous bathroom law earlier this month, they weren’t focused on their stance on the issue so much as what was at stake — namely, $1.4 billion in federal funds and $800 million in federally-backed student loans.
As UNC President Margaret Spellings conveyed in the meeting, compliance with the state law means putting a significant number of students at risk if the state loses the Department of Justice lawsuit that alleges that  it violates a number of federal civil rights laws.
But Spellings also said that the White House does not hold “any greater interest in poor and minority students losing financial aid than we do,” according to the Associated Press.
And thus stands the Obama administration’s dilemma between taking a stand on the issue by cutting federal funding to the state and protecting the aid of thousands of poor and minority students in the state. For the administration, it means that now is the time for clever political maneuvering — the White House needs some strong negotiators on its side in order to have its cake and eat it too.
For North Carolina, the looming threat of federal funding cuts should be more than enough for Republican legislators to save the legal battle for another day. It doesn’t help that the bathroom predator myth from which the law derives is largely baseless — as ABC News reported, a coalition of sexual assault and domestic violence organizations found that none of the 200-plus municipalities and 18 states with transgender bathroom access nondiscrimination laws have experienced increases in public safety issues. Moreover, the harm for transgender people remain high. As a study cited in The Atlantic by assistant professor Kristie Seelman at Georgia State University found, failing to provide gender-inclusive bathroom access is associated with higher suicide rates among transgender people.
But perhaps, just as cutting funding for North Carolina schools would make an example out of the state in the Obama administration’s eyes, standing by a fear-driven law in order to placate right-wing discomfort about the changing face of America would show that bathroom access is a conservative priority. But if the civil rights and women’s rights movements have shown America anything, it’s that states don’t win federalist battles regarding discrimination. So regardless of the highly-anticipated outcome of the federal lawsuit, North Carolina lawmakers standing by their bathroom law should change their tune. In the short term, losing means facing major financial consequences. And in the long term, it means standing in the way of inevitable identity inclusion.
Support of the “transgender” lie means that SCIENCE loses.  Rational thinking loses.  Truth loses.  The millions of people who don’t suffer with confusion over their identity lose.  Ironically, the so-called “transgenders” lose as well because we allow them to live a lie.  More importantly, they will be allowed to live a lie that ignores and trashes science, and quite literally affects the millions of people who don’t have any confusion over their gender.  The whole movement is completely indulgent.  Higher suicide rates are due to their mental illness, and have nothing to do with a purported lack of access to public restrooms.  …And even if one were to believe that it were somehow related to a PERCEIVED lack of access, then it would still be due to their own choosing.  They may not have chosen the illness, but they have chosen to live as the opposite gender.  They have chosen to live a state of confusion, and are attempting… successfully so far… to drag the rest of us into their confusion.
I won’t do it.  Fair, loving, reasonable, intelligent people who think this one through, won’t do it either.  It doesn’t help them and it doesn’t help anyone.  Moronic.
Please feel free to read my many other scientific, truth-based and non-religious viewpoints on this ridiculous topic…. then get back to your studies and things that matter… please!!!

The women’s lacrosse team’s undefeated season came to a screeching halt on Saturday with a 12-11 overtime loss to Syracuse in the NCAA tournament quarterfinals at the Carrier Dome in New York, ending the Trojans’ season in heartbreaking fashion.
The Women of Troy (20-1) rallied from a 3-goal deficit with under six minutes to play in regulation to force overtime, only to have Syracuse junior Kelly Cross score the game-winner with three minutes and 21 seconds remaining in the first overtime session. Cross took a pass from Halle Majorana and buried it from point-blank to send the Orange (19-5) to their fifth consecutive semifinals appearance in the NCAA tournament.
It was a back-and-forth first half that ended with the score deadlocked 5-5. The Trojans scored the first two goals of the second half on tallies by senior midfielder Amanda Johansen and junior attacker Cynthia Del Core. But the Orange went on a 3-0 run, with two goals by Majorana to give her a hat trick in the second half and Syracuse a 8-7 advantage.
Johansen equalized with her fourth goal of the game, but the Orange connected on three straight goals once again over the next five minutes to give them an 11-8 lead. Still, the Trojans swung the pendulum back in their favor with the next two goals, and Del Core equalized with under two minutes remaining as she took a feed from Johansen across the middle and fired it in.
Johansen, who was all over the place in the game, had a chance to win it in the dying seconds as she dodged left and attacked the net aggressively, but was stopped by the glove of Syracuse goaltender Allie Murray.
In overtime, a turnover by junior attacker Kylie Drexel handed possession to the Orange, who called timeout and set up the game-winning goal by Cross.
The Women of Troy had been perfect in 1-goal games this season, though this was the first time they played a game that went to overtime. They are now 0-4 all-time in overtime games. The 12 goals was the most allowed by USC this season. USC defeated Stanford handily in the second round of the NCAA Tournament before running into Syracuse.
The loss is a bittersweet end to a historic season for the fifth-ranked women’s lacrosse team, which won all 17 regular season games for the first time in its four-year history and cruised through the MPSF Tournament.
Junior attacker Michaela Michael moved into second place in MPSF history for single-season goals after scoring her 68th goal of the season in the loss. The 99 points she scored on the season are also a USC record and fifth in MPSF history.

The NCAA tournament came to a close for the No. 10 men’s tennis team after falling short to No. 7 Georgia in the round of 16, 4-3.
Despite holding a 3-1 lead, The Trojans weren’t able to close the match. The loss marked the end of the team’s season and left it with a 17-7 record this year.
“I think with matches like that you have this overwhelming sense of being a part of something that is bigger than you. It’s such a great rivalry between Georgia and us,” head coach Peter Smith said. “To play that quality of a match for three and a half hours, you really feel like it’s a honor and privilege to be a part of it. It hurts to lose, but it was just a great match.”
The Trojans began the match with a win on Court 1 in doubles, where the No. 46-ranked pair of junior Nick Crystal and freshman Laurens Verboven were able to beat Georgia’s Austin Smith and Ben Wagland 6-1. On Court 3, freshman Jack Jaede and sophomore Tanner Smith closed it out with a 6-4 win over sophomore Wayne Montgomery and freshman Emil Reinberg, giving USC the doubles point and the lead in the dual match.
Jaede kept the momentum going at the fifth singles spot with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Georgia freshman Jan Zielinski, giving the Men of Troy a 2-0 lead. No. 32 Montgomery put the Bulldogs on the board with a 6-1, 6-4 over No. 41 Crystal at the second singles spot. No. 121 sophomore Thibault Forget was able to close his match in two sets over No. 123 freshman Walker Duncan with a score of 6-2, 7-6 (6) bringing the Trojans to one match and one point away from the upset and reaching the quarterfinals.
However, at the sixth singles spot, junior Rob Bellamy wasn’t able to finish off the match after winning his first set and suffered a comeback against Georgia senior Nick Wood, who ended the match with the score of 6-4, 2-6, 1-6, tightening the gap at 3-2 in the dual. At third singles, No. 69 freshman Logan Smith fell to No. 64 sophomore Paul Oosterbaan 4-6, 6-7 (7), making it 3-3 and leaving the odds to Court 1, where No. 23 senior Max de Vroome was facing No. 17 Smith.
After a slow start, de Vroome was able to bring the first set to a tie-break before eventually losing the tiebreaker 2-5. In the second set, de Vroome bounced back and was able to pull a 6-1 win and take the match to the final set.
With the score tied at 3-3, de Vroome was able to break and hold serve, making it 5-3. Smith held serve and the Trojan had a chance to close the match and the dual on serve at 5-4, but was unable to convert it. At 5-5, Smith kept his momentum going and grabbed the lead at 6-5, securing the tie break. De Vroome, who was serving to stay in the match, didn’t hold serve and the Bulldogs finished their comeback and punched their ticket to the quarterfinals.
The Trojans began the tournament by defeating UNLV 4-0 and No. 32 Georgia Tech 4-2 in the first and second rounds respectively in order to advance to the Round of 16.
De Vroome and Crystal will keep playing in the singles draw starting on Wednesday.
De Vroome will play against Dominik Koepfer of Tulane. Crystal will face off against Joao Monteiro of Virginia Tech.

In a few months, the best athletes in the world will congregate in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for the 2016 Summer Olympics — or at least that’s the plan.
The Olympics are supposed to be a grand event, celebrating unity in the spirit of competition and bringing tremendous pride to the host country.
But for this Olympics in Brazil, it’s been quite the contrary. Mired in everything from the Zika virus to doping and political scandals to unfinished infrastructure, these Olympics are building up to be one of the worst yet. Some are even calling for its cancellation.
Quite frankly, that wouldn’t be a bad idea. Zika, of course, is the gravest concern. We’re talking about a sexually transmittable disease with no cure that we are only beginning to understand. Sending tens of thousands of athletes from around the world — not to mention the hundreds of thousands of fans and tourists who will cram into Rio for three weeks and then travel back to their native countries — could turn Zika into a worldwide epidemic.
Heck, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued a statement in February urging pregnant women and their partners to stay away from the Olympics because of the mosquito-borne illness, citing dangers of fetal infections and brain abnormalities. Risks as severe as those warrant a thorough examination of whether or not these games are worth it.
Athletes certainly are weighing the benefits and potential costs. In February, the U.S. Olympic Committee told its athletes that they could skip the Olympics if they were worried about Zika.
Women’s soccer team goaltender Hope Solo backed out of the games, though she eventually said she will “begrudgingly” participate.
“I strongly believe that no athlete should be put into this position — to decide between your Olympic dreams and your own health,” Solo said to CNBC in May.
Irish golfer and four-time major winner Rory McIlroy became the latest Olympian to voice his concerns, telling the BBC on Monday that he and his fiancée would like to start a family one day.
This is an impossible predicament. Participating in the Olympics is a dream, an honor. But risking long-term health to take part in the games should not be part of any equation. It is unfair to the athletes who have trained their entire lives for this moment.
And the crazy thing is, Zika is just the start of Brazil’s problems, which could take up an entire book. There’s the extremely polluted waterways in Rio, which means swimmers, sailors, rowers and kayakers risk having viruses and bacteria enter their bodies. The Associated Press tested the waterways last year, and the results were alarming, showing that there were 1.7 million times the number of disease-causing viruses than would be considered “highly alarming” in the U.S. and Europe. This is the water they’re asking world-class athletes to swim in.
There’s the political crisis that is rocking the country, with President Dilma Rousseff suspended and facing impeachment for misusing federal funds. There’s the fact that Brazil is in the midst of its worst recession in a century, and what the government is doing to ensure this doomed spectacle looks somewhat presentable — evicting poor families from their homes to build infrastructure for the games — will only make it worse.
This could have all been avoidable if Brazil wasn’t awarded with the games in the first place. But that’s difficult considering nobody really wants to host the Olympics anymore. The cities that would theoretically be perfect fits — Boston, Munich and Stockholm, to name a few — don’t want to deal with the chaos of reconstructing their city and the burden of organizing a world event. Look up images of old Olympic sites today — Athens, Beijing, Sochi, etc. — and you’ll see decrepit buildings that serve no purpose outside of three weeks of competition. In Greece, the 2004 Olympic Games are largely to blame for the massive debt crises the country is currently in.
So, we are left with choices such as Brazil, a country dealing with way too many problems to take on the task of running the world’s biggest event. We are left with Beijing, China, playing host to the 2022 Winter Olympics because literally nobody wanted to host the games. The only other bidding country was Kazakhstan (yes, Kazakhstan), and the games will be completely reliant on artificial snow because it actually doesn’t snow in Beijing.
I’m not advocating for the Olympics to be held exclusively in rich countries that can saddle the economic burden, but something needs to be done so that poorer nations such as Brazil can handle a tall task that takes money, time and painstaking organization. Right now, Brazil has none of the above.
I’m sure Rio is a wonderful city where the games could have been wonderfully staged. But we’re less than three months away from the world’s biggest event, the point where everything should be set and only final preparations need to be made. Instead, athletes and fans are left wondering if they should risk their own health and the health of their future children in order to attend the Olympics in a country ravaged by corruption, scandals and recession. This may very well be the saddest Olympics in history — if it even gets started.

it does snow in beijing…just not enough for full-blown winter sports
The Olympics should be downsized by eliminating the many gimmicky events added during the past 5 or 6 Olympics. Tandem diving? Trampoline? Ridiculous. 
“…with President Dilma Rousseff suspended and facing impeachment for misuse of federal funds…” Way to uncritically regurgitate the State Department line instead of making any serious attempt to understand the situation. Obviously you don’t have the space or time to comprehensively summarize what isn’t the primary focus of your article, but at least bother to research the summary you do include.
There’s a good argument for why the Olympic Committee is a neoliberal sham, and it isn’t with a condescending, holier-than-thou attitude toward second- and third- world countries. (Really? You’re going to make fun of Kazakhstan for… being Kazakhstan? Really punching up!) Your myopic Americasplaining of international crises is victim-blaming at its worst.
