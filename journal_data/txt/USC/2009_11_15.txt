Most class projects never leave the classroom, but one class’s effort has traveled 2,600 miles away — to Washington, DC.
School of Social Work Professor Ralph Fertig’s social welfare policy class developed a draft of a resolution for the House of Representatives that addresses the issue of homelessness and the foster care system. The draft made it to Congress, where Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) presented it to the House.
“Our bill concentrates solely on children and describes the plight of homelessness of children,” Waters said.
The resolution was initially developed as part of a class project, to teach Fertig’s students about the legislative process and the importance of social work.
The class split into different groups that looked at statistical information, advocated for support from the community and legislatures, interviewed homeless people and developed a documentary of the whole process.
“Fertig has been working on this draft, and he thought it would be a great learning experience for us to take a draft and then submit it to [Rep.] Maxine Waters,” said Stanley Wipfli, a graduate student studying mental health.
The resolution states that children have a right to have a home and recognizes the effect the recession has had on the number of homeless families and homeless youth. It encourages the government to reprioritize the system so homeless children can be housed with their families instead of being immediately entered into the foster care system.
“You certainly can’t blame children for being homeless,” Fertig said. “There’s nothing more perilous or dangerous [for children] than living on the streets.”
Fertig explained that the current system has a flaw when it comes to housing homeless children.
“Parents have to make a choice: either keep the child with them on the streets or surrender them to foster care,” he said. “But they can’t get the child back unless they get housing, and they can’t get the housing without the children. It’s a catch-22.”
After Fertig and his students drafted the resolution, it was presented in a town hall meeting at LA Southwest College where Waters heard the presentation.
“Maxine Waters, that day when she heard the resolution, she accepted it and said, ‘OK, I’m taking this to Washington,’” Wipfli said. “She finessed it again to make it more sellable as a resolution, and she then presented it to Congress.”
Waters said she does not often see students initiating legislation.
“It seems that USC is helping to direct and train [students] in a combination of community organization and the kind of social work that takes you out from behind the desk,” she said.
Though Fertig said he thought there could be some resistance to the bill, Waters said the resolution likely won’t face obstacles.
“Most members [of Congress] are acutely aware of homelessness and the plight of children,” said Waters. “Whenever there’s a story about homelessness … it captures the heart.”
Fertig said that the resolution could be passed in the fall of 2010.
This is the first time a class in the School of Social Work has presented a resolution to Congress, but Fertig said he intends to continue with this type of project.
Fertig said he and State Assemblywoman Mariko Yamada have agreed to submit a bill addressing other issues of homelessness and the foster care system.
“We will be introducing another bill in January, and the class will be totally involved,” Fertig said.

A $1 million gift from an alumna will allow the USC Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy to establish its first endowed faculty chair, with a focus on pediatric care.
The Sykes Family Chair in Pediatric Physical Therapy, Health, and Development was established with a $1 million donation and a $250,000 matching pledge from Tracy Sykes, a USC graduate and member of the Division’s Board of Councilors, and her husband Gene Sykes, a managing director at Goldman Sachs.
The endowment will enable the division to expand its research through community programs and increase recognition of pediatric physical therapy.
“We want to increase our activity in pediatrics. This is a way for us to begin that process,” said James Gordon, associate dean of the Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy at the School of Dentistry. “It helps us establish a center of excellence in our department.”
Linda Fetters, a professor of physical therapy and director of the Developmental Motor Performance Laboratory, will be the inaugural holder of the chair.
“It’s really more about furthering the mission rather than furthering my work,” Fetters said. “The chair will allow us to promote research, education and community service with our USC neighbors.”
Fetters, who joined the division in 2007, was selected in September to hold the chair after deliberation by the dean, chair and provost of the division examining her extensive work in pediatrics.
She specializes in research focused on helping children and infants with developmental problems and has worked with the Sykes family in her lab for the past two years to help children with cerebral palsy.
“The real importance of the endowed chair is that we have made a lasting impact on pediatric care,” Fetters said. “I feel the additional responsibility to maintain the mission of the division in terms of education, research and service.”
Tracy Sykes has been an ardent supporter of pediatric research at the university, and has often brought her own children into classrooms to help students understand topics like pediatric strength evaluation and development assessment, Fetters said. The Sykes’ gift is an extension of her support for the school, she said.
“Tracy really wanted to give back to the division in a way to help it meet its goals. It’s a tribute to the education she received,” Fetters said.
The endowed faculty chair will also give students in the division more opportunities to engage with community programs, according to Barbara Sargent, a doctorate student in biokinesiology who has worked with Fetters for two years.
“[The endowment] will develop relationships between community programs that service children with disabilities or are at risk for disabilities and the division,” Sargent said. “It will give students the opportunity to participate in community relationships that are either going to be built or strengthened.”
The division plans to raise the total endowment of the chair to $1.5 million by soliciting funds from foundations and private donors.
“[The endowed faculty chair] is a milestone for us in terms of achieving prominence,” Gordon said. “We hope that this will help to establish some innovative approaches to treating children.”

Stafon Johnson can talk again.
Just 47 days after crushing his throat in a tragic weightlifting accident, Johnson is certifiably on the road to recovery and can now speak — albeit limitedly.
He did so in a meeting with the press prior to USC’s game against Stanford on Saturday.
Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
“God has a plan,” Johnson whispered, reciting the last words he heard from his late grandfather. “Run, Stafon. Run.”
(Click here to listen to Stafon Johnson at Saturday’s press conference.)
Only seven words, yes, but seven meaningful words.
Johnson was very close with his grandfather, Larry Mallory, who died of a heart attack in the spring of 2007.
“Just the whisper was like he was giving an interview,” said Kim Mallory, Johnson’s mother. “That was a big thing, because it wasn’t expected to hear any type of sound for a while. [It was] overwhelming.”
Dr. Ryan F. Osborne and Dr. Jason S. Hamilton of the Osborne Head & Neck Institute accompanied Johnson at the press conference, held in the Coliseum press box an hour prior to kickoff against the Stanford Cardinal.
They said Johnson had in many ways beat the odds expected of him. At the time of the injury, doctors said he was lucky to have survived. Now, they credit his “gladiator-type attitude” for the speedy recovery.
“I think anyone looking at him today or who heard his story would say that this is miraculous,” Osborne said. “We wouldn’t expect him to be at this state this early … but he’s an athlete, he’s determined, he’s never believed that he was the underdog — and so far you can see the results.”
Johnson no longer needs a breathing or feeding tube and can eat solid food, but doctors emphasized that the journey is not complete, yet.
He can still only whisper a few words at a time.
“At this point in time, he does have some minor limitations,” Osborne said. “Just because we don’t want him speaking, don’t want him to do anything to strain his neck area at this point in time.”
Osborne added that those limitations would be removed in the “very near future.”
Mallory said Johnson has at times slipped up and uttered a few words, but she said her primary mode of communication with her son was through his laptop computer, which he uses to write notes to her.
Johnson shrugged when asked if he planned to play football for USC next season, but he still seemed upbeat throughout the 20-minute conference — at least until the last question, when a reporter asked about Stafon Jr., his 15-month-old son.
Johnson put his head down and appeared to be in distress. His mother understood, saying only that it was “hard,” but adding, again, “God has a plan.”

The USC women’s soccer team couldn’t live on the edge any longer.
After its last two games ended in a draw, USC found itself in the same position in the first-round NCAA tournament game against Oklahoma State. But this match needed a winner.
Daily Trojan | Young Kim
Oklahoma State was able to avenge a 1-0 loss to the Women of Troy back in September as the Cowgirls ended USC’s season with a 0-0 (5-4) victory.
Junior Alyssa Dávila had a chance to keep USC’s hopes alive, but the sixth-round shooter’s shot was saved by Adrianna Franch. This is the first time that USC (12-6-3) has failed to advance past the first round of the NCAA tournament since 2004.
“It’s hard to swallow and a very disappointing way to finish the season,” said coach Ali Khosroshahin. “[Penalty kicks] are not a fun way to determine the outcome of a game.”
Khosroshahin put backup senior goalkeeper Brittany Massro in goal for the penalty kicks even though senior Kristin Olsen played the entire game. USC had a competition in practice the day before and Massro outperformed Olsen.
The move appeared to pay immediate dividends, as Massro saved Oklahoma State’s first shot. But after trading scores for the next two rounds of shooters, Franch took away USC’s advantage by saving sophomore Carly Butcher’s shot. The teams again traded two rounds of scoring until Davila’s shot was blocked.
“Brittany did a really good job and made a great save,” Olsen said. “She is really good at penalty kicks and as a goalie, anything you save is a bonus.”
While USC’s defense didn’t allow the Cowgirls to score for the second consecutive time, the offense sputtered in the attacking third. Despite having the majority of possession during the second half, USC failed to put the ball in the back of the net.
Sophomore Brittney Kerridge hit a rocket in the first overtime than Franch had to punch over the crossbar, but those kinds of opportunities were few and far between for the Women of Troy.
“We couldn’t find any rhythm in the attacking third,” Khosroshahin said. “We were a better team in the second half but other than Kerridge’s shot, we weren’t very dangerous.”
USC was called for 17 fouls while Oklahoma State was only called for three. While Khosroshahin isn’t one to make excuses, especially when it comes to officiating, he couldn’t help but wonder if the Women of Troy were ever going to get a break.
“We play hard but I wouldn’t call us a dirty team,” Khosroshahin said. “The officiating didn’t help. I mean they had three fouls in 110 minutes.”
Regardless, the Women of Troy know that the game rested on their feet – but as it has all season, inconsistent play let them down.
They showed promise by beating No. 9 Santa Clara on the road earlier in the season in the midst of a nine game winning streak. But they only won two of their last seven games and had trouble putting together 90 minutes of solid play.
“During this game, we were better in the second half than the first half. We had better control of the tempo and at times played good soccer and at times not so good,” Khosroshahin said.
The Women of Troy will graduate three key players in Olsen, defender Meagan Holmes and midfielder Marihelen Tomer. After playing this season with a group of inexperienced players, the team will come back next year with more experience and look to improve upon this season’s performance.
“I don’t think the outcome shows how we’ve grown,” said Olsen, who will enter the Women Professional Soccer draft next semester. “I think we did a good job dealing with [the inexperience] and the younger girls really took the older girls’ advice. They learned a lot.”

The No. 17 USC women’s volleyball team is officially over its mid-season slump.
Behind the exceptional play of sophomore middle blocker Lauren Williams and sophomore setter Kendall Bateman, the Women of Troy upset the No. 4 Washington Huskies Friday night, 3-2 (25-18, 24-26, 22-25, 25-21, 15-13), and defeated the No. 25 Washington State Cougars Saturday, 3-1 (24-26, 25-18, 28-26, 25-16), at the Galen Center.
Daily Trojan | Tim Tran
In Saturday’s match against the Cougars, Williams followed up her strong Friday night performance and posted a career high 19 kills without an error for a .559 night (19-0-34).
Bateman, out all week with a sprained ankle, recorded 60 assists and eight digs for USC (17-9, 6-8), in what coach Mick Haley called a gutsy performance.
“She inspired everybody,” Haley said. “With Bateman now being the setter that could deliver to the middles, it really makes the middles an offensive threat. It has just taken a while to get these guys on track.”
Williams got going in a big way, and so did fellow middle blocker junior Audrey Eichler, who posted 13 kills and five blocks. Also helping spread out the offensive attack Saturday was sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter (14 kills and 10 digs) junior outside hitter Kimmee Roleder (12 kills and eight digs) and senior outside hitter Jessica Gysin (11 kills and eight digs).
Haley said his team’s attack was crucial in the victory over the Cougars.
“It really spreads out the opponent’s defense because now we’re attacking in the middle and all six rotations,” he said. “It makes it real tough on the opponents to prepare for us.”
Cassie Robbins led the way for the Cougars (16-10, 5-10) with 12 kills and no errors for a .571 (12-0-21) night, while Meagan Ganzer had a team-high 14 kills. Brittany Tillman added 12 kills while setter Renee Bordelon had 49 assists.
None of it was enough to stop the Women of Troy, who had five players post double figures in kills.
After losing the first set to the Cougars, USC bounced back to win the second set behind an 11-3 run. The third set, however, was the turning point of the match. Trailing 24-21, USC evened the score at 24 before Jupiter recorded back-to-back kills for the set win.
“Being down 24-21 and not panicking was really good,” Haley said. “Winning that game really put us in control.”
Leading the match 2-1, the Women of Troy used a 9-2 run to put the Cougars away in the final set.
The victory allowed USC to keep its momentum high coming off Friday’s upset over No. 4 Washington (20-4, 10-4) in a five set duel.
The middles led the way in the match, as Williams posted 14 kills and tied a season high with eight blocks and Eichler had a season high 15 kills and four blocks.
Gysin recorded 15 kills for USC while registering a career high 20 digs while sophomore Jupiter had a team high 21 kills and eight digs. Bateman had 57 assists, seven digs and three block assists while senior libero Alli Hillgren chipped in 28 digs.
Airial Salvo led Washington with 17 kills, 18 digs and six blocks while hitting .390 (17-1-41).
Trailing 2-1 in the match, USC battled back to win a tough fourth set behind the stellar play of Gysin and Jupiter.
Up 11-9 in the final set, Gysin’s shot off a Washington block gave her team a 12-9 lead. The Huskies followed with a kill and a triple block to make the score 12-11.
Eichler used a kill for a 13-11 lead before Washington sided out for the 13-12 score. Gysin gave USC the match point and Jupiter’s final kill left USC with a win in the match, 3-2.
“I felt like we had been in control most of the match,” Gysin said. “The games we did let them win, we just let it slip and made too many errors.”
Following two impressive wins, the Women of Troy head to Oregon next weekend to face the Ducks and Beavers for its last two road matches of the season. Haley hopes his team’s regained swagger and improved defensive play will be the difference away from the Galen Center, where USC has struggled all season.
“We’re starting to get our confidence back. Playing at home certainly helps,” Haley said. “But winning on the road is essentially the way you get ahead in this conference.”

USC had been embarrassed at home by Stanford before, but not like this.
Not in November. Not on Homecoming. And certainly not by 34 points.
But behind the power of senior running back Toby Gerhart, the No. 25 Cardinal (7-3) did, thoroughly overpowering the No. 11 Trojans, 55-21, in a shocker before 90,071 spectators celebrating Homecoming at the Coliseum. Stanford’s 55 points were the most ever scored against USC.
Heavy load · Running back Toby Gerhart plows through the USC defense for one of his three touchdowns in Stanford’s 55-21 victory. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
“This feels really weird,” USC coach Pete Carroll said after the game.
It looked like things would go the Trojans’ way when they forced a three-and-out on Stanford’s first drive and immediately drove inside the Cardinal 20-yard line.
But freshman quarterback Matt Barkley fumbled a first-down snap under duress from the Stanford defensive line. From there, it was all Cardinal in the first quarter, as redshirt freshman quarterback Andrew Luck threw for one touchdown and Gerhart ran for another.
“We started really fast,” Luck said. “We knew it would be a tough game, but starting fast really helped.”
Gerhart consistently busted through the USC front seven, totaling 29 rushes for 178 yards and three touchdowns. He ran for nine first downs.
“We’ve seen him run the ball like that week in and week out, so we’ve just gotta tackle him,” junior linebacker Malcolm Smith said. “But he just got out.”
Opponents all season have mentioned Stanford’s physicality, especially when running the ball. The Cardinal overpowered Oregon a week ago with 254 yards on the ground. This time, they had 325.
“That’s something that we have to do as a team: be physical and play physical,” Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh said in his postgame press conference. “And we do other stuff offensively that compliments the physical side.”
Luck, Harbaugh’s 19-year-old signal-caller and admitted protégé, outplayed his freshman counterpart Barkley, completing 12-of-22 passes for 144 yards and two touchdowns to Barkley’s 21-of-31 for 196 yards and a touchdown. The biggest difference was Barkley’s three interceptions — all three of which resulted in Stanford touchdowns.
Barkley said after the game that he probably shouldn’t have thrown at least one of them. The picks stymied USC’s running game, which was mostly effective.
Junior running back Joe McKnight carried the ball 16 times for 142 yards and a touchdown, but the Trojans again failed to convert a total of eight third- and fourth-down opportunities.
“One of the big things was to be able to stop the running game,” Harbaugh said. “We didn’t stop it, USC popped some runs, but for the most part it wasn’t 10, 10, 10. We got some stops and some sacks.”
USC had fostered some momentum after a fumble recovery by senior safety Taylor Mays gave the Trojans the ball on the Cardinal 36-yard line, down 21-7 in the third quarter.
Barkley then delivered a 36-yard touchdown strike to redshirt freshman wide receiver Brice Butler to make the score 21-14.
But Stanford would answer back with a methodical 10-play drive capped off by a six-yard touchdown run by Luck.
“That was a big momentum shift, and when I caught it I was like ‘Let’s go,’ now that we’d scored,” said Butler, who made his first career start in place of the injured Damian Williams. “The whole team was feeling that way.
“Then, it kinda died down.”
USC would score once more, but Stanford again responded quickly. The Cardinal’s last five drives all ended in touchdowns.
With the 34-point loss, USC has been outscored 174-131 in its last five games.
This is also the first time since Carroll’s first year, 2001, that the Trojans have lost three games in one season.
“Things are looking nasty right now,” Smith said.
USC’s last three home losses have all been against Stanford, but the Trojans said that didn’t matter.
“Any team that beats us, they’re surprised,” Butler said. “They didn’t think it was gonna happen.”
Stanford’s Gerhart, a member of the 2007 team that upset the Trojans 24-23 at the Coliseum, agreed.
“I was surprised a little bit,” Gerhart said. “They’re USC and have been the premier Pac-10 team. We’ve been the underdogs.”
But although Stanford stays in the thick of the Pac-10 championship race, the Trojans are essentially eliminated from the BCS bowl and Pac-10 title contention. They must now face the likelihood of a pre-New Year’s bowl game.
But for now, the Trojans have a bye-week break before cross-town rival UCLA comes to the Coliseum on Nov. 28.
“If you think about it, it probably comes at the perfect time,” Butler said. “We lost, and now we have to sit here and think about it for two weeks.”

Birds circled the Coliseum after the game, but they might as well have been vultures, swooping in to prey on the dying legacy of the once-mighty Trojans.
This is really it. It’s over.
USC’s claim to the title of college football’s most dominant team officially came crashing down Saturday, when Stanford unabashedly dismantled the Trojans, 55-21.
Headache · Injured receiver Damian Williams looks to console devastated running back Joe McKnight during the Trojans’ lopsided loss to Stanford. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
Oregon was just the beginning. Stanford was the confirmation.
The torch has been passed. USC’s reign atop the college football world and the Pac-10 is officially finished.
This statement could have been written after the shellacking in Eugene, Ore. But after Oregon’s subsequent loss and USC’s belief that anything could happen, people inserted USC back into Rose Bowl consideration.
Now, as USC used to gloriously proclaim, it left no doubt. Goodbye Rose Bowl, hello Sun Bowl — if that.
There was no tricky spread offense like the Ducks used to blast the Trojans on Halloween. There was no hostile crowd.
USC knew what was coming and it couldn’t do anything about it. All the Trojans could do was throw their hands in the air and concede, just like the rest of the conference used to do for them.
“They ran the same plays we thought they were going to run,” senior safety Taylor Mays said. “They ran power lead. It wasn’t complicated or intricate like Oregon’s offense at all.”
Stanford senior running back Toby Gerhart plowed through USC’s defense again and again, finishing with 178 yards on 29 carries and three touchdowns.
Gerhart, who USC coach Pete Carroll compared to Jerome “the Bus” Bettis earlier in the week, looked the part. And the entire USC defense went along for the ride.
“They blocked us — time, after time, after time, after time,” Carroll said.
USC appeared one step behind on nearly every play.
The Trojans were not able to dig themselves out of a bad start like we’ve seen so many times in the past when they’ve fallen behind at home.
They were not able to shore up the defense and stop the barrage either — Stanford just kept coming at them, not stopping until it put up 55 points, the most USC has ever given up.
Stanford recognized this was not the USC team of old.
“Everything wasn’t there,” Stanford cornerback Richard Sherman said. “It didn’t seem like they were playing as hard as they usually do.”
This USC team just didn’t have the same fight.
“In years past, you saw them destroy people,” Sherman said. “It didn’t matter what the score was, they were going to put 100 on everybody.”
In case you didn’t check your calendar, the game was played in November, a month in which Carroll had never lost.
Winning in November meant USC was always getting better every week.
Winning in November meant USC continued to peak while the rest of the nation was leveling off.
But to lose in such a lopsided way at home, in Carroll’s month and on Homecoming, signifies the end of an era.
The end of that streak is a symbol for the end of USC’s hegemony.
“The whole thing about November, I’ve never even known why that existed,” Carroll said. “But as a competitor, I freakin’ loved it. I loved the fact that we finished better than other teams.”
Carroll hates to see the streak end because it now puts USC in the “other teams” category. The man who is penning a book called Win Forever just found out that dominance has its limits.
Trojan fans also expected Carroll to be able to rebuild forever — to keep dominating even when he had to replace NFL-caliber players, year in and year out.
Freshman quarterback Matt Barkley was spectacular at times this season, but Saturday he showed he is not yet ready to hold this team together.
The boundless expectations placed on the 19-year-old were unfair and we all saw why firsthand. Barkley threw three bad interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown, and also fumbled on USC’s first drive.
“I’m not used to this. It doesn’t feel right,” Barkley said after the game.
The inexperienced linebacker unit has held tough this season, but it couldn’t — and shouldn’t — have been expected to perform like the four NFL players who held those positions last season.
Eventually, a team, no matter how great, finds itself on the other side. Sooner or later, the score is evened and the pendulum swings.
Because no one stays on top forever.

So our team has had a bad year. Big deal, they will come back. The way Barkley plays now, he will be a super star QB by the time he is a Senior.  I currently live in KY, and hear all about the “wonderful and so much better SEC”, yet I also notice that the SEC “so called top ” teams play 3rd ranked teams to run up their stats. I would put ANY Pac 10 team up against an SEC team on any given Saturday and let the fur fly.
I have grown up as a USC fan (67 years) and will remain so until I die.  GO TROJANS!!
Please people, you act like someone died. So we lost, how long did you expect us to remain on top. Coach Carroll is an awesome coach. I am sickened to hear so many just give up…..get real. We are a dynasty and will be for a long time. What did you expect after losing 8 players to the NFL, a true freshman QB, and so many injuries. I believe in my Trojan team and will forever be their #1 fan.
Oh, and for you FAKE fans who left early last Saturday…shame on you. Don’t ever come back!!!!!!!!!!!1
xoxox to Coach Carroll and the team!!!!!!!!!!

“Oregon was just the beginning. Stanford was the confirmation.”
Umm, did you see the Washington game???
Rebuilding year my foot. I agree with Manning Up. Trojans always have “low” expectations of only winning rivalry games against UCLA and Notre Dame. What’s funny though is that SC usually never cared much about the “rivalry” with Notre Dame until this year. SC always tends to overlook their lesser opponents. This is why teams like Washington beat them this year. I also doubt USC’s football team will be ranked #1 in the pac10 conference next year. Seems like other programs in the Pac10 has caught up with recruiting and will do an awesome job next season.
It’s sad to see that a team and it’s fan only cares about winning 2 games. What happened! Well, USC has always been over rated in a loser conference. Put USC up against any SEC team leading back to 5 years ago and USC would have never made it out to the Rose Bowl. University of Second Choice.
All good things come to end … unfortunately.  However, a “new” dynasty can by built.  This season may be all but lost for ‘SC, but there is much hope for the Trojans next year. A program this great cannot be determined by one or two lopsided losses. ‘SC can rise from the ashes and re-claim itself someday soon.  Fight on Pete!
The phoenix can’t rise this time.
Ppff, seriously? We have no reason to believe it can’t. Pete’s here, Barkley’s only gonna get more sure of himself, and the team will only improve. If you want them to go try a new OC or try some staffing changes, go ahead and say that.  Sitting in your corner sucking your thumb is pathetic.
now we know how lesser teams like UCLA and Notre Dame feel every year.
but not for long…
I’m sure this has been as painful, if not more, for the players and coaches as it has been for us fans.  They will work hard during Spring and Summer to come back with a renewed attitude and determination to win three straight National Championships starting next season.
Go Trojans.  Fight On!
USC for life!
We R SC  we will never let 1 season determine our faith and belief in the men from troy,,Fight on
Get Norm Chow back here…and fUCLA.
We will be just fine as long as we are still better than the Bruins and the Irish (and we are).
The dynasty has not come to an end…we’ve been with the team since the ’60s, it’s merely taking a break!  Fight on Pete and team!!
As long as we beat UCLA, everything will be fine in Troy.  Come on guys, you have two weeks to get your act together.  Fight on!!!
I’ve been a USC Trojan fan for over 60 years — A successful season always meant wins over Notre Dame and UCLA– there is still a chance.. FIGHT ON
SC will be back next year. One subpar year does not topple a great team.
Barkley and crew will work extra hard in the off season and do well again next year.
Even with a subpar year it has been great to see the good games that they played. I would rather be SC than UCLA.
It was great while it lasted. Thanks Pete.
I concur. All good things come to an end. Nothing is forever, and nothing stays the same.

The setup: After finishing off the last of their away games, the road-weary Trojans returned to the Coliseum in hopes of solidifying their standing in the Pac-10.
The story: Stanford made itself at home on USC’s Homecoming Day by running roughshod over the Trojans in a 55-21 blowout. The 34-point loss was the worst in the Coliseum in almost 43 years for USC.
Running it up · Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh decided to go for two with the game out of reach. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
“I’m not sure I have the right words to describe being humbled like this,” USC coach Pete Carroll said.
Stanford racked up 325 yards rushing, led by senior running back Toby Gerhart, who tallied 178 yards and three touchdowns. The Norco, Calif. product was only recruited as a fullback and linebacker by USC coaches, who believed he would not be able to be a running back in the Pac-10.
But Gerhart ran through the heart of the Trojan defense all day behind Stanford’s gritty offensive line. The Cardinal repeatedly utilized the power play, as coaches and players called it, to get Gerhart moving downhill.
Stanford’s offensive success was all the more startling given that it offered few surprises.
“They ran the same plays we thought they were going to run,” senior safety Taylor Mays said.
Saturday’s outcome was the latest in a frustrating series for USC’s maligned defense.
Last week’s performance against Arizona State gave the Trojans reason for confidence, but Carroll said that he did not think his team had solved its glaring errors.
“We’ve just fallen apart here and given our opponents the chance to do whatever they want,” he said.
Barkley’s struggles: True freshman quarterback Matt Barkley threw a career-high three interceptions and fumbled once against the Cardinal.
With redshirt junior wide receiver Damian Williams sidelined by ankle injury, Barkley finished with less than 200 passing yards for the third straight game.
The recent woes perplexed the signal-caller, who said he would have to look at film to determine the source of his struggles.
“I don’t feel flustered,” Barkley said. “We’ve had some bad breaks. When we’re turning the ball over like this, it’s tough to bounce back.”
Barkley’s most costly mistake came when a pass intended for redshirt freshman wide receiver Brice Butler was intercepted by Stanford senior cornerback Richard Sherman, who then streaked 43 yards down the sideline for a touchdown. The score gave Stanford a decisive 42-21 lead with less than 12 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter.
“He looked like a kid,” Sherman said. “He’s a great quarterback and he’s going to make great plays, but everybody has to grow.”
The call: Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh surprised many with a fourth-quarter decision to attempt a two-point conversion with the game well in hand after Gerhart’s third touchdown put the Cardinal up 48-21. Gerhart was stopped short of the goal line, but Harbaugh’s move still drew plenty of questions following the game.
“I think he was trying to go for 50,” Gerhart said with a smile.
Carroll said he was not offended by the decision and did not address it in the postgame handshake.
“In that situation, they can do whatever they want,” Carroll said. “Sometimes those decisions are for attitude and your own team, so you do what you have to do.”
The decision did grate on some USC players, however.
“It was kind of disrespectful,” junior linebacker Malcolm Smith said. “It was definitely a punch in the face.”
Insult to injury: Mays’ postgame press conference was drowned out by the sounds of Stanford players hollering and knocking against their lockers, rattling the wall.
“They deserve to have that feeling,” Mays said.
Oh man, that was great.  Carroll deserved every bit of that beat down.  He’s been running up scores on people for years.  I hope every team out there with a double digit second half lead on USC from now on always goes for two, always goes for the TD, and beats them by 35!  Best game ever.
Totally agree with Marc on how pete carroll is pushing Aaron Corp off the ship just because of that performance during the Washington game. He shouldn’t base his opinion on Corp’s performance based on that one game. It could have been a bad hair day for Corp that day.
pete carroll really has an ego problem. This is why he has A LOT of turnovers when it comes to his assistant coaches.
It first started off with Norm Chow being pushed off the boat.  pete carroll hated the fact that the media was giving all the credit to Norm Chow for the excellence he brought to SC for working hand in hand with Carson Palmer and building accuracy with Troy Polamalu back in the 2003 year.
After he left, Orgeron and Lane Kiffin ditched pete carroll.
So much for his arrogance.  Then most recently, Steve Sarkisian and Nick Holt left/darted from USC. Again, probably because carroll has his head up his a$$.
The 2-point conversion was classless? Oh puleez! I have seen coach pete carroll run up the score on many teams, and even when USC was up by 20 points, such as the Washington State game, the trojans did a nasty on-side kick. WTF? USC up by 20 points against an underdog Washington State team and the trojans try to recover their own ball?  I also recall pete carroll doing this sh-t to Hawaii back in Sept 2003 at the Coliseum. SC was up by 30 points over Hawaii and Carroll decided to do a nasty onside kick. I heavily remember this as coach June Jones (now at SMU) was totally infuriated at pete carroll. Ahahaha. Now pete carroll knows how it feels to be at the other end of the yard stick. In the past, he used to dish out pain and suffering. Now this year, Oregon has spanked USC. Then Stanford spanked and ripped apart a once-good USC football team. I hate to say this, but it USC’s defense doesn’t step on the gas pedal, I’m sure UCLA will give you a long long day next weekend.
The 2 point conversion was in retaliation for usc’s running up the score last year at Stanford.
Couple years from now folks will look back at Carroll’s shabby treatment of Aaron Corp as the beginning of the end of his dynasty.  What was supposed to be an environment built around competition has been exposed as little more than Pete’s pet project, based more on his rather strange infatuation with Barkley.  Meanwhile, the loss of valuable assistants has crippled the program, especially on defense.   So Troy burns while Pete works on his golden boy.   And, by the way, I say this as a huge fan and alumnus.
Finally, has anybody been a bigger flop than Taylor Mays?  Way to go big guy, you cost yourself millions with this year’s rather pedestrian performance and failed to step up as a leader.  Pathetic!
The two point conversion attempt by Stanford, uh er, should I say Harbaugh was un-called for. Ya’ll do understand that it was not an attempt to run up the score, but an “attempt” to kick a good man while he’s down. That is Harbaugh’s id, his MO, his high school bully personality. He has always been a spoiled brat and a bully; even in his NFL days. Heck, he and Jimmy Clausen are more suited for each other than Luck or Gerhart.
Harbaugh hates Pete Carroll’s success at USC, and he knows that he cannot compete with Carroll, in the long run. All the mouthing off Harbaugh has done during his tenure at Stanford is just a smokescreen for him to try to beat up PC, and build up his image and future NFL coaching career. There was absolutely no reason for Harbaugh to call the 2 pointer, other than to kick Pete C. in the teeth while he was down. Yes, it was not a football call, but another one of Harbaugh’s personal vendetta calls… And when SC’s Defense stopped the 2 point conversion, they sent a message to Harbaugh that he can’t bully us at will. SC fought back and kicked him in the teeth on national TV. Unfortunately, ESPN won’t show that highlight and make good press of it. …
This action among many, my friends, does not make for a sense of style and class, that is Pete Carroll. And Harbaugh will never be able to match all that Pete Carroll is and stands for, because Harbaugh is a self-centered bully in the worst sense of the word.
And in the words of my mother-in-law….There’s two kinds of class.
Class, which is Pete Carroll, and
clASS, which is Harbaugh.
Sta Fight On 13 my friends.
Beat the Bruins.
Greg Katz…Do you really believe that work of fiction you put out there?  Pete Carroll is class?    I’m not saying he is a bad guy, but you must have some issue to elevate Pete Carroll to such heights…or low expectations.
Outside of Trojan town, everyone one is loving Harbaugh’s decision to go for two.  USC has certainly run up some scores in recent years and haven’t pulled any punches in lopsided games.  And what are you talking about that SC’s defense sent a message by stopping the 2 point conversion?  They let in another touchdown after that!  Maybe their message should have been to not let Stanford get 55 points.
This year must be hard for Mays.

Members of community and student groups gathered Friday to discuss their ideal plan for the development of Vermont Avenue.
The Figueroa Corridor Coalition for Economic Justice — a group of 25 local businesses that monitors the development of land along the 40-block strip running from USC to the Staples Center — hosted its second “Visions for Vermont” event Friday, as part of preliminary planning efforts to create a land-use plan that will best serve the needs of the community surrounding USC.
Multiple choice · (from left to right) Juniors Jennifer Yee, Corrine Montana and Elisabeth Gustafson work on a survey examining the future of Vermont Avenue. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
The “Visions for Vermont” project is a response to the challenges local residents are facing. The series of meetings started in October, and are held monthly to allow for open communication between the community and the coalition.
“This is an alliterative process — we consistently ask and get feedback,” said Ava Bromberg, planning and action research coordinator for the Figueroa Corridor Coalition.
Two primary concerns in the development of the Vermont area are safety and housing, the coalition has found.
In a survey conducted by the coalition last week, almost half of the respondents said feeling unsafe was their number one concern. The number two concern was the ability to continue living in the neighborhood, as many residents said they are concerned about the rising cost of housing in the area.
One solution presented at Friday’s “Visions for Vermont” attempts to address the area’s affordability for community members.
Proposed by Tafarai Bayne, an organizer for the Figueroa Corridor Coalition Land Trust, the solution emphasizes USC’s duty to build more affordable housing for students so fewer students look outside the university for housing.
The coalition has also attempted to head off these problems by starting the UNIDAD campaign, which aims to prevent the displacement of people who live in the USC community.
To address safety concerns, Bayne suggested a joint community program and an effort to make more information available to residents.
In both propositions, Bayne emphasized the importance of a constant dialogue among the city, the community and the university.
Student group Campus and Community United strives to keep this dialogue open. A few members of CCU were in attendance Friday.

“Now is a pivotal moment because USC is making their Master Plan and they are working with the city,” said Jenn Yee, a member of CCU. “In order for the community to get their voice heard, they have to get their voices heard now.”
Members of CCU and others at the event got the chance to view interactive booths set up by the Figueroa Coalition and students from Cal Poly’s Community Planning Studio.
One booth displayed a panorama view of the city and had thought bubbles that displayed things that residents found both positive and negative in their community. The data displayed on the map was a result of input given at the first “Visions for Vermont” event in October that 80 people attended
“We are gathering information to reflect the needs of the community,” said Gabriela Garcia, a community organizer for the Neighborhood Land Trust. “We want the people behind the plan.”
At another booth, students from Cal Poly’s Community Planning Studio asked visitors to create their ideal community. The students had a variety of paper cutouts including trees, community centers and street signs for people to paste onto a blank map of the community.
The students from Cal Poly will also help with the next steps of the “Visions for Vermont” project, which will include putting together architectural plans that will reflect the concerns and needs of the community.
Although a timeline has yet to be established, “Visions for Vermont” plans on holding its monthly meetings until March 2010.
“Next summer is a big drafting point for the city,” Bayne said. “The budget crisis may make the timeline change.”
Joe- Did you attend the program? I appreciate your concerns. Important to know is that they not only care about affordable housing, but also more integrally, uplifting of the diversity of the neighborhood and ensuring that everyday community residents have access to socioeconomic opportunity. This means, not only affordable or even mixed income housing, but also there are more job, education, and business opportunities that can benefit local community leaders and provide important amenities for all community members in the area.
A nd, i’m not sure if those figures are accurate. My housing is between 600-700 a month. Those figures sound actually very typical to the more expensive privatized or university-private housing partnerships in the area.
This whole charade ignores the reality that the USC area already has too much “affordable housing” and it is the over-concentration of the poor in one zip code that welcomes the criminal activity.  (Note that poverty does not cause crime, but the poor and “minority” population are more likely to be victims.)
The USC area needs industry and job development, not more subsidized housing.  The Fig Corridor’s suggestion that USC build more housing for students is ludicrous.  USC’s idea of “affordable” is $1K/bed/month, where the existing private rental market already provides space at half that number.  Integrating students into local housing uplifts the community and brings resources to bear, where otherwise local residents have little voice.

High school is about friends, feelings and finding your place in a teenage community, which feels like your entire world. Although stereotypes and reputations can predetermine that often undesirable place, Dare shows us that, by doing something you’re afraid of, you can find your way out.
In Dare, screenwriter David Brind and director Adam Salky bring the archetypical good girl, bad boy and loner to life in a way that many high school movies are not bold enough to do.

As each of these high school seniors sets out to do something they’re afraid of — either because someone told them they needed to or simply because they can’t stand being trapped by their overbearing reputations — their worlds become intertwined in a way that reveals a teenage reality seldom seen on film.
Alexa (Emmy Rossum) is dying to break out of her overachieving, aspiring-actress shell, but doesn’t have the courage to do so until a successful yet pompous actor, Grant Matson (Alan Cumming), gives her a rude awakening by telling her she must have real-life experience before trying to portray an entire range of human emotion in her school play.
Although Alexa’s best friend, Ben (Ashley Springer), is more comfortable with his reputation as an outsider, he has an entirely different problem: He is gay, but can’t bring himself to admit it.
Both Alexa and Ben use Johnny (Zach Gilford), the bad boy that every girl seems to want, to try to solve their problems. But Johnny has his own set of insecurities that creates a love triangle so complicated that none of them seems to be able to find their way out.
Between a regrettable loss of virginity, a sexual encounter in a swimming pool between the two male leads and an intimate scene involving all three main characters, Dare is both surprising and uncomfortable — but in a very real way. It is this grittiness that sets the 2009 Sundance Film Festival selection apart from most other high school movies.
Split into three parts — each told subtly through the eyes of a different main character — Dare allows each of its characters to develop and be understood more thoroughly by viewers than even the characters understand themselves.
Rossum fits perfectly as Alexa, fulfilling the role of the aspiring actress flawlessly both before and after the good girl goes bad. Springer and Gilford also do justice to their characters, creating complex male protagonists who, as we find out throughout the film, have so much more than meets the eye.
On the periphery of the film’s primary storyline, Dare includes a number of other characters who give the film a humorous undertone. Sandra Bernhard as Dr. Serena Mohr, Johnny’s therapist, and Ana Gasteyer as Ruth Berger, Ben’s mom and a fellow therapist, use their psychoanalytical personalities in the film to bring to light the comedy and awkward adult-adolescent interaction that accompany the teenagers’ overdramatized problems.
As the film’s drama plays out from the different characters’ perspectives, Dare also creatively alters our view of their world. What starts off as a colorful setting filled with a diverse range of high school personalities turns into a dark jumble of ambiguous backdrops against teenage confusion. It is displayed in a way that anyone who has undergone all the painfully awkward new experiences high school has to offer can understand.
Dare is both familiar and unexpected, but it is, above all, honest. Although its ending is abrupt and without explanation — a tool not as effectively executed in this film as in some — it will leave you with an insatiable craving to know what happens next to Alexa, Ben and Johnny as they leave their high school personas behind and embark on adulthood — where they will finally be free to be whoever they want.

Office buildings tend to be more like condominiums than your standard, single-family suburban homes in that the workspace is often divided into small parts and shared by many different families or in this case, businesses.
Even well-established companies often lease plots of cubicle space to smaller companies, which often become their annoying neighbors. So, it is not uncommon for employees of a chiropractic practice to work in close proximity to magazine editors, or bankers right next to the geniuses behind the commercially successful Bumpit hair accessory.
Even though you run into these quasi-familiar strangers in the line at the cafeteria, the designated smoking area and the parking lot on a daily basis, you rarely exchange pleasantries. And thus, interactions with these folks are often strained and unpleasant.
In my office building, there were several other small companies working under the same roof — Barnes and Noble and Wells Fargo corporate offices; a smaller up-and-coming law firm and a biosciences company.
Trying to “make nice” with these people can be difficult, especially when it seems like they’re going out of their way to make you angry. Take, for instance, one slightly older, considerably overweight Wells Fargo employee. She worked upstairs, yet made frequent trips downstairs to my law firm’s neck of the woods for the sole purpose of using our bathrooms.
Now there’s no official building ordinance governing which employees can use which restroom facilities. But when the hefty woman, clad head-to-toe in stretchy fabrics, waddled into our restroom, it sure made me wish someone had thought to regulate this type of behavior.
Lacking the tact to wait for the other ladies to exit the bathroom, she would start taking care of her “business” in a way that only someone who overindulged in Chanos would. The stench combined with the sound effects, only heightened by the bathroom acoustics, sent my co-workers heading for the halls.
But it wasn’t always the other in-office employees that made for these truly unpleasant interactions. One Larry the Cable Guy doppelgänger would come into the office on occasion to perform a double-duty: routine maintenance on the firm’s copy machines and routine ogling of the attractive young secretaries. The trouble with Larry the Copy Guy was that his unsolicited leering and unsavory comments were nearly impossible to avoid because he did all of his work in the copy room — arguably the most high-traffic area of the office.
Unaware he was in the office one summer’s day, I sauntered into the copy room to hole-punch some documents as a favor to a paralegal. As soon as I caught a glimpse of that unmistakable farmer’s tan, I hightailed it out of there, but not before he caught a glimpse of me too.
Not one to waste an opportunity to make sexual advances, he asked me if I would be so kind as to help him find that pretty, blonde secretary he nicknamed “Miss Smiley” on a past visit. (Weeks earlier he had been seen staring at her blouse as he speculated on the number of boyfriends a healthy girl like herself might have.) Though I knew exactly whom he was referring to, I did my best to prevent the sexual harassment lawsuit waiting to happen and fled the scene.
But regardless of how annoying or disgusting these people may be, we’re obligated to respect them just enough to treat them cordially. As much as you may want to pour a cup of scalding hot coffee on Jim from AT&T’s receding hairline or give Connie from reception a paper cut for every grammatically incorrect email she CCs you on, you have to hold back and hold it together.
If you can find even the slightest bit of humor in it all and shrug it off with a smile, surviving the workweek won’t be so unbearable after all. And by doing so, you’ll give your company the best damn reputation in the building.
In the case of agitated v. easygoing, it is the judgment of this column that you should be sentenced to a life in the unemployment line should you hate, rather than appreciate, the outlandish interactions with your office neighbors.

On the second Thursday of every month, the Downtown Los Angeles Art Walk attracts art and culture lovers of all types, who move through the historic district’s numerous galleries, bazaars and street performances. Most visitors are there to observe or purchase novelties, but some like to offer untamed criticism.
“Was the inspiration for your lighting airplane bathrooms?” jabs an old man with a cocky smirk. The young photographer under scrutiny is stunned by the comment, unsure of how to respond.
In focus · Cinema-television student James Marcus Haney shoots black-and-white portraits at the Downtown Los Angeles Art Walk last Thursday. - Ben Rolnik | Daily Trojan
“Why don’t you take a seat, sir,” says a man with charcoal-covered fingers and a turquoise feathered hat. “I’ll draw you.”
The young photographer grants him a look of thanks and continues prepping his exhibit, hammer in hand.
In a profession fueled by denigration and subjective originality, finding your footing can be a daunting task. But photographer and USC cinema-television student James Marcus Haney and Los Angeles-based artist Robert Vargas continue to strive for innovation.
Their latest endeavor? Combining print with paint.
“The intention is to develop a dialogue between the two mediums by juxtaposing our representations of the models,” Haney said.
Models take turns sitting in Haney’s makeshift studio in front of a white, reflective backdrop with two panel lights on either side of their face. Seventeen inch by 22 inch black-and-white portraits are then printed and passed on to Vargas, who uses the prints as a canvas to paint the models from his own perspective, adding bold flashes of color.
Three 66 inch by 44 inch portraits were also hung on the gallery walls to be painted live at various points in the evening.
Model Isabela Mesquita had very different feelings about the three representations made of her at the event: a digital portrait, a charcoal sketch and a painted print.
“The photo is just me. I’m not posing or anything. That’s pretty much the way I see myself,” she said.
The model and USC international student said that when she saw Vargas’ charcoal depiction of her, “All I could think was, ‘Oh my God, this really looks like my mother.’”

So when Vargas began painting on Haney’s carefully crafted canvas for the first time, Mesquita didn’t know what to expect.
“I didn’t get it. I’m not an artsy person, so I didn’t know what to think of it,” Mesquita admitted.
Emily King, a freshman majoring in business administration and cinema-television, was optimistic about the painting from the beginning.
“Vargas took an objective form and transformed it into a colorful interpretation of human essence,” King said.
Haney intentionally strives for an objective portrayal of his subjects for his part of the collaboration, blowing out and desaturating the images, leaving composition as his chief objective.
“I wanted to shoot the people very simply — without a certain emotion,” Haney said. “That really lends itself to being like a canvas.”
This simplicity means Vargas is free to interpret the photo and model however he wants.
Sometimes he splatters paint in an abstract pattern; other times he uses the paint to accentuate certain features and highlight the diverse range of hues present in the models’ skin; and still other times, he colors in a few odd bits and leaves the rest blank. It’s a process new to both Vargas and Haney, and as such is constantly changing.
“The communication between mediums and artists is always evolving, so it’ll go as far as someone can dream,” Haney said.
It was observer Jennifer Lydic’s first Art Walk experience, but instead of browsing through all the venues, she found herself watching Vargas paint for the majority of the evening.
“It’s [a] really interesting  perspective that’s so instinctive,” Lydic said. “The photograph is suddenly reinterpreted, and it’s really fascinating to just watch it all evolve.”
Although there were a few skeptics present at the Rosslyn Loft, the overwhelming consensus from the crowd was one of approval and intrigue. But as for the future of this hybrid medium, Haney admits that it’s still speculative.
“We’re really just looking at art in new ways and expanding the definition of what a portrait can be. We aren’t rewriting what a portrait is — just furthering its context,” Haney said.
Judging by the size of the crowd, which stayed well past 1 a.m. — long after the remaining galleries had closed for the night — the artists responsible for the event will have an audience for their cross-platform communication for many shows to come.
He takes my breath away…
The  ” man with charcoal-covered fingers and a turquoise feathered hat.” who say’s ““I’ll draw you” in your article is THE ARTIST –  ROBERT VARGAS. I was there and my observation of that moment was that Vargas handled it BRILLIANTLY! He transformed that “smirky/cocky old man” from critic to participant to FAN by having him sit for him. If you noticed at the end of the pose, the man (who turned out to be a photographer) says to Vargas “I would love to work with you”, handed Vargas a card and proceeded to sit and watch, silently now…. (i was standing right behind them). There is an old Chinese proverb that say’s,” The man who says it can’t be done should not interrupt the person doing it”. Vargas is a staple in the downtown L.A. Art scene and has participated in the art walk since day one. He is recognized for his larger figurative paintings and is credited with bringing the gallery to the streets by being the first artist to paint outside during the art walks, long before anybody else was. It would have been interesting to hear his perspective on the collaboration process. His own individual creative process is so intriguing to watch already! Anyone who has never seem him work live, you must see! http://www.vargaspresents.com
This sounds facinating. I would love to see a tryptic of the three mediums. Another story perhaps?

Now that the House has passed the Affordable Health Care for America Act, Americans are faced with the increasingly real possibility of health care reform.
The Senate’s version of the bill will face extensive changes before it is ultimately made law. Nevertheless, based on the current plan it is possible to predict that, although health care probably won’t change significantly for USC students, it could change the way Californians view health care.
Matteo Marjoram | Daily Trojan
Students can expect to remain relatively insulated from the reforms while they are still in school. Californians, however, will be facing a significant rise in the costs of their general policies, as well as rising taxes for Medicare and general income.
And although students may feel safe now, the reality is that our age demographic will be footing the bill for the majority of the nation’s health care services in the coming decades.
In all fairness, young people too should ultimately benefit from these adjustments. Yet for those who were hoping to enjoy high salaries and low taxes in the coming years, such changes will be far less welcome. Buying health insurance now could help students, and the nation, in the long run.
USC Professor Glenn Melnick, an expert in public policy and health insurance system design, estimates that USC’s health provisions for students are unlikely to change because of this reform.
“Bottom line: This law probably won’t change anything for students,” Melnick said.
Melnick posited that there’s a good chance things will change for students after graduation.
“The way the law is written now, young people in particular will have to pay higher premiums to pay for older people’s pre-existing conditions, making premiums much higher than they used to be,” he said. “So probably people’s salaries are going to drop as employers have to pay these higher premiums. This amounts to a tax on young people and it may be more equitable to fix this problem by changing the tax code than by burying it in health insurance regulations.”
Of course young people won’t want their salaries to drop, especially in an economy that’s already depressing wages. But if this reform is going to provide coverage for those most in need — those with pre-existing conditions — a financial sacrifice by the majority is worth it.
Besides, the new system should provide significant benefits to young people as well. For those on the lower end of the income spectrum, the sliding-scale income subsidy, set to help individuals and families purchase their own health insurance, could be hugely beneficial.
“The reality is that insurance is not a good deal for young people, especially if you’re trying to choose between paying rent and buying health insurance,” said USC Professor Dana Goldman, an expert in health care reform. “The point of the subsidies is to encourage them to buy health insurance.”
In this case, young adults will benefit from the government’s new agenda of providing coverage for every American.
And getting young people insured could also significantly help the state budget.
“The problem is that young healthy people often don’t buy insurance, and then if there’s a catastrophic event, it gets picked up by the public sector. The goal should be to get these people into the insurance pool,” Goldman said. “In general it’s not a very good deal economically to buy insurance when you’re young, but from a social perspective it’s important.”
In California, this is a particularly compelling issue, where so much of state revenue is used to cover emergency procedures for the uninsured. It remains to be seen whether or not this coverage will apply to those living in the country illegally or on temporary visas.
In the coming years, the younger generation can expect to pay more on health insurance than any other generation in American history.
Yet perhaps, for the first time, young Americans will be able to take pride in a nation that provides the best medical care in the world — for everyone.

“Yet perhaps, for the first time, young Americans will be able to take pride in a nation that provides the best medical care in the world — for everyone.”
I agree with Diane. Americans have ALWAYS been able to take pride in the best health care system in the world, at least since World War II. The Democrat bill is not about health care “reform”, in fact, it’s not about health care at all. Look in the bill and see if you find health care anywhere. The bill is entirely about power and government control.
Pay attention to the bill’s proponents. They claim they want better and more affordable health care, but their rhetoric is to attack, denounce, and punish the drug companies, insurance companies, and doctors and nurses that are the source of that care. Does that click with anything you were taught as a child (or should have been taught) about free enterprise being the engine of prosperity? How is crushing new taxation, regulation, and government hostility toward our health care industry going to help them do their jobs?
My word, Rosaleen, if American young people don’t already realize that we have a vastly superior health care system in this country, then they’re dumber than a bag of hammers.
And your last statement is an outright lie, to quote a famous politician from South Carolina. Government health care systems have NO WHERE improved health care for everyone. This is a liberal, statist-minded myth. Keep drinking the Kool-aid, Rosaleen; you’re in good company.
@Chris Ganiere:
I mean, if you really think that the government has to be entirely need-blind, then yeah. You’re in a pretty diminuitive minority if you see progressive income tax, luxury tax, gas guzzler tax, social security, medicare, etc. as the establishment of a “class system established by government aristocracy.”
I’m personally proud to be able to help our seniors and those in need. I’m lucky enough to be here and have the capacity to make a healthy salary, and I’ll gladly pay social security tax as well as offset the costs of those with pre-existing conditions today.  If it means that later in my life others will do the same, and I’ll be in that “privileged class” when I need it most desprately, then it seems like a pretty bang-up deal.
Is this equal treatment under the law? Dividing up the population and taxing one group to pay for another is unequal. You are creating a class system. Government oppressed that get no health care benefit without paying and government privileged that get benefits with reduced or no cost. And there is a third group, the government aristocracy that decides who is privileged and who is oppressed.
What the current provisions in the Bill for VD treatment?  Seems to me they should give out condoms as part of any comprehensive plan.

What’s the best way to be protected from H1N1? Well, the vaccine, but that’s not a choice for everyone because of limited supplies, time constraints or personal beliefs.
On the next errand run, picking up some hand sanitizer, vitamin C, antioxidant-rich juice, multivitamins and a stockpile of over-the-counter drugs might ease that panicked state of mind.
Is it obsessive,  or just survival of the fittest, when we’re buying into having hand sanitizer everywhere we go, drinking expensive health drinks to keep our immune systems up and arming ourselves with Lysol to kill germs like we would hordes of enemies in a video game?
Sure, it’s nice to think we can buy a sense of protection and be fashionable while doing so. Corporations simply love it when we buy up their stocks of cranberry-lavender scented hand sanitizer or vitamin waters named “B-Relaxed” and “Sync.” As Marge Simpson put it, “It’s like drinking e.e. cummings!”
There’s nothing wrong with protecting yourself with whichever means are available, but we’re falsely equating consumption with protection.
Retailers are jumping on the swine bandwagon, and benefitting greatly from the public’s nerves, but ultimately the panic is unnecessary.
Hand sanitizer alone won’t protect you from the guy a seat away in lecture coughing and sneezing his brains out. It might make you smell good, though, depending on which fruity scent you picked.
Likewise, drinking a Jamba Juice smoothie with an immunity boost probably means nothing if, afterward, you eat from a communal bowl of chips at a crowded party.
Money alone can’t buy good health — you have to make lifestyle changes. Hand sanitizer and fruit smoothies are not substitutes for eating balanced meals and getting the right amount of sleep necessary to maintain our immune systems.
According to the Los Angeles Times, Clorox reported a 23 percent increase in net income last week — worth $157 million — driven by the spike in demand for its disinfectant products. Similarly, hand sanitizer sales are up 70.5 percent from this time last year.
It’s oddly disturbing to think there’s a market benefit to the pandemic. It’s great to have those products on hand, but it doesn’t equate to avoiding crowded areas or staying home when beginning to feel nauseous, the smart moves to take when fighting H1N1.
In the state of social panic over H1N1, it’s wiser to listen to common sense and medical science over the industry.
Maintaining a healthier lifestyle to fight H1N1 requires a calm approach, not a panicked one. Today’s society is already filled with enough panic, and we don’t need any more apocalypse nuts roaming the streets after watching 2012.
The World Health Organization has declared nearly 6,500 swine flu deaths, a number it thinks low-balls the reality.
Don’t start running at those numbers though — do the smart thing. Check for symptoms and use proper precautionary measures.
The marketers capitalize on the state of panic by offering “solutions” at a price. Hand sanitizer for $5? A smoothie for $4? A bottle of multivitamins for $10? Sure, they’re not exactly exorbitant prices, but buying these things incessantly adds up to a lot of money and can lead to a false sense of security.
It’s okay to buy those fruity hand sanitizers as long as we’re making the right lifestyle changes to go along with it and not ignoring the vital signs. Got a fever and a stomachache? See a doctor and don’t go to class. Don’t just drink a Jamba Juice, take a multivitamin and go to class with that headache.
Personal stockpiling will only be reminiscent of those silly Y2K doomsday prophecies — the right step is to think rationally and take protective steps each day, instead of buying one backup plan.
Fruity scents aren’t bad things — go ahead and splurge on the cutely marketed bottles of hand sanitizer and soaps if it’s fitting. It’s smarter to save money on generic brands of soap, washing every so often and keeping a healthy lifestyle while avoiding high-risk environments. Be skeptical about these “protective” products because they are not cure-alls or surefire measures — what’s key is a calm, not panicked, approach to living a H1N1-free life, which involves eating and sleeping right, and, above all else, watching out for symptoms as they arise.
A bottle of Vitamin Water isn’t a smart substitute to seeing a doctor when you’ve got a flu-like symptom. Believing in “buying” a healthy H1N1-free lifestyle is just as bad as believing the Mayans were right in predicting the world will end in 2012 — panic solves nothing.

The USC swimming and diving team fell to Arizona on Friday, but recovered Saturday to overthrow an undermanned Arizona State.
The long anticipated rematch with the Wildcats did not turn out well for the Trojans. Arizona crushed both the men’s (177-123) and women’s (180-119) teams.

The silver lining behind the defeat was breakthrough performances by some of the younger USC swimmers.
Diving’s Victoria Ishimatsu remains unbeaten this season, winning the 1 meter (314.40) and the 3 meter (304.73), with freshmen Ariel Rittenhouse coming second on the 1 meter (263.18) in her season debut.
Senior Zoltan Povazsay clocked outstanding times for his first duel meet of the season, winning both the 200 yard  free for the men in 1:38.25, an NCAA consideration B cut and the 500 freestyle in 4:31.50.
Junior transfer Lyndsay DePaul won her 400 Individual Medley in 4:17.29 and the 200 freestyle in 1:47.86, scoring her two NCAA consideration times. Sophomore Katinka Hosszu also clocked an NCAA B cut in the 200 freestyle, placing second with 1:48.30.
Junior Clement Lefert stepped up to the challenge of filling in for teammate Richard Charlseworth and won the 1000 freestyle in a 9:16.64.
“Clement had a beastly 1000 against [Arizona’s] Jean Basson even after losing his cap halfway through,” sophomore captain Patrick White said.
Lefert went on to win his second individual event of the day in the 100 butterfly (49.18), and was out touched for second place in the 200 butterfly by Wildcat A.J. Tipton.
Freshmen Haley Anderson won both distance events, winning the 1000 freestyle by four seconds in 9:57.87 and scoring her first NCAA B cut in the 500 freestyle (4:50.95).
“Haley really stepped up and got us the wins we needed,” senior captain Krissy Forelli said.
Sophomore Tanya Krisman lead the field by more than two seconds in her 200 butterfly and improved on her NCAA consideration time by winning the event with a 1:58.96 time.
It was in the opening medley relay, breastroke, backstroke and sprint freestyle events that Arizona made its move.
“We stood strong against Arizona after a tough medley relay loss,” senior captain James Martin said. “But we were very close to a top-5 team and are getting better all the time.”
On Saturday the Trojans traveled to Tempe, Ariz., to face the Sun Devils. The match proved to be much less of a battle for USC. The Trojans defeated ASU 169-122 for the men, and 168-130 for the women.
Anderson raised the bar in the first individual event of the day, the 1650 freestyle, and won by an amazing 40 seconds. She clocked 16.26.06 and scored an NCAA B cut in the process. Anderson later went on to win the 500 freestyle (4:48.77), where she improved on her NCAA B cut from Friday.
Povazsay also improved on his 200 freestyle NCAA consideration time from Friday, clocking a 1:37.64. Behind Povazsay was Lefert and White in second and third place.
DePaul won all three of her individual events: 200 freestyle (1:48.14), the 200 individual medley (2:01.28) and the 100 butterfly (54.89) where she lead a Trojan trifecta with freshmen Yumi So and Krisman placing in second and third, respectively.
In the men’s 100 backstroke, USC swept the field, led by freshmen Alex Lendrum (51.19), sophomore T.J. Auner and junior Shane Tusup.
Freshmen Lili Shiota swept the backstroke events, quickly establishing herself as the Women of Troy’s new top backstroker, clocking a 55.72 in the 100 and a 2:00.00 in the 200.
Hosszu won the 200 breastroke in a NCAA consideration time of 2:16.52 and the 200 butterfly (1:58.75), followed by So and Krisman coming in second and third.
In the sprint-freestyle events the Trojans were significantly stronger against Arizona State, with White, sophomore Jeff Daniels and junior transfer Emmett Walling sweeping 1-2-3 in the men’s 100 freestyle. Daniels also won the 50 freestyle in 20.81. Christel Simms won the 50 freestyle for the women in 23.75.
In an event foreign to the men’s captain, Martin out touched fellow Trojan breastroke specialist Dillion Connolly in the 200, clocking a personal best time of 2:06.04.
USC men’s 400 freestyle relay featuring Daniels, Walling, Povazsay and Lefert dominated the field and clocked an NCAA B cut of 3:00.33.
“Our relays did an excellent job racing well,” Forelli said. “Both the men and women.”
In diving, Ishimatsu won the women’s 3 meter springboard (334.88) and sophomore Harrison Jones took first for the men’s 3 meter springboard (464.25). Junior Steven Starks won the men’s 1 meter springboard (338.78).

High drama and USC men’s water polo home games have rarely gone together over the past few years.
But with the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation regular season title on the line, that’s exactly what the packed house at McDonald’s Swim Stadium got — senior driver Justin Rappel hitting on two dramatic scores late in the game — as No. 1 USC edged Stanford 13-12 in overtime early Saturday afternoon.
Daily Trojan | Katelynn Whitaker
On a 37-game winning streak at home that spans nearly five seasons, the Trojans have rarely dealt with late-game pressure, but the No. 3 Cardinal (19-2, 6-1) proved hard to handle.
Rappel and the Trojans (21-1, 7-0) dealt with ferocious Stanford offensive attack and defensive pressure all game. Unable to stop Stanford after holding them to a single goal in the first period, the Trojans were forced to counter with some offensive fireworks of their own.
Senior two-meter Jordan Thompson played what USC coach Jovan Vavic called “the best he has ever played for us,” scoring four goals and firing up the Homecoming Weekend crowd, who were hooked on the energy the senior was bringing to the pool.
But that doesn’t tell the whole story of Thompson’s dominant day.
“Not only did he score four goals, but he drew five ejections,” Vavic noted.
The six-on-five advantages that the Thompson and the Trojans drew were especially important for USC, who needed all the help they could get on offense. By the end of the match, the Trojans had given their worst defensive effort of the season, the 12 goals the most they had given up since 2006.
As the fourth quarter came to a close, Stanford’s senior Janson Wigo scored his fourth goal to put the Cardinal up 11-10 with three minutes remaining. Down for the second time in the quarter, the Trojans looked on the brink of defeat, but senior two-meter Shea Buckner’s second goal of the game on a man-up advantage evened the score.
After both teams locked down their defenses late in the quarter, a miscue on the Cardinal offensive side of the ball with less than 30 seconds remaining allowed a Trojan fast-break opportunity, which Rappel converted.
But nearing victory, the Trojans had a collective mental slip.
An exclusion was called just three seconds into the Cardinal possession, and with just four ticks remaining on the clock, Cardinal sophomore Jacob Smith scored, sending the game into overtime. The mental side of the game had been a trouble spot for the Trojans all day.
“We lost our focus during the game and got away from our basics,” Vavic said.
Knowing that he had to rely on his group of record setting seniors for the overtime period, Vavic let his team play, and they rewarded his confidence, as Rappel scored his fourth goal of the game early in the first overtime period.
Absent all game, the Trojan’s nation best defense woke back up for the overtime period, silencing the Cardinal for good, and delivering the Trojans a MPSF title and their 50th victory in their last 51 contests.
Not lost to Vavic was what the game taught him about his current edition of Trojan water polo.
“You’re not always going to have a great game, you’re not always going to do the right thing,” Vavic said. “When you go down twice in the fourth quarter and you come back twice, still continuing to fight, that’s a great sign.”

With time winding down late in the second half at the Galen Center, sophomore guard Briana Gilbreath figured it was time she made a play.
“I felt like I hadn’t played good all game,” Gilbreath said.  “I just needed to help my team out in some possible way and that was kind of my time.”
Gilbreath broke open a close game by stealing a pass in the backcourt and taking it the length of the court for the game-winning layup.
“They got sloppy with the ball so I just went out there and took it,” she said.  “It was a major play for us.”
The steal and score capped a furious rally for USC that culminated in a 68-63 win over Fresno State on Sunday.  The victory was the first of the season for the Women of Troy, who lost their season opener to No. 11 Xavier on Friday.
Gilbreath led the Women of Troy with 17 points and seven rebounds.  Fellow sophomore Ashley Corral struggled from the field but chipped in 10 points and seven assists.
USC coach Michael Cooper was pleased with the resolve his team showed against a tough early season opponent.
“I think Fresno State is obviously a tournament team,” Cooper said.  “To come here and give us all we could handle was a testament to how good they are.”
Despite shooting poorly all evening, the Women of Troy were able to overcome a 32-29 halftime deficit thanks to some increased defensive pressure.  Cooper said the team did a better job of keying in on the Fresno State shooters after halftime, which forced the Bulldogs into contested shots.
“One of the things we wanted to do was run them off that 3-point line,” he said.  “They got up 30 [3-point] attempts but a lot of them were forced.”
USC trailed 55-48 late in the second half before scoring 13 unanswered points.  A baseline 3-pointer by senior Heather Oliver pushed the margin to six with four minutes remaining. USC held Fresno State scoreless for almost six minutes during that span.
The Bulldogs roared back, going on a quick 5-0 run to cut the deficit to 61-60.  Fresno State also tied at the game at 63 before Gilbreath put it away for good.
Freshman Christina Marinacci provided a spark off the bench for the Women of Troy, grabbing six offensive rebounds and scoring 11 points.
“You just want to look to be aggressive and crash the boards on offense,” Marinacci said.  “Especially when you have a height advantage like we did against this team.”
Junior Kari LaPlante added 12 points and 6 rebounds for the Women of Troy.  Juniors Jaleesa Ross and Hayley Munro led the Bulldogs with 22 and 21 points, respectively.
The Women of Troy fell 81-71 in overtime to Xavier on Friday, despite a career-high 25 points from Corral and 19 points and three steals from Gilbreath.  On Sunday, USC was able to overcome an off-night from Corral to secure its first victory.
“Our team is not built around one person having to score 25 every night,” Cooper said after Sunday’s game. “Other people stepped up [today] and played extremely well.  Getting four players in double figures is always a good sign.”
USC now heads north to Spokane, Wash., to take on Gonzaga on Thursday night.

The USC women’s cross country team’s roller coaster season came to a disappointing end at Saturday’s NCAA West Regional Championships in Springfield, Ore.
In a race dominated by Pac-10 heavyweights Washington and Oregon, the Women of Troy could not overcome a slow start, finishing 20th in a field of 25.
“It was very disappointing,” USC coach Tom Walsh said. “We were prepared for what was going to happen. The top teams that were going to qualify were going to go out hard in the first few hundred meters and then slow the race down. They wanted the race to be as slow as possible because NCAA championships are in 9 days and they don’t want to expend as much energy.”
Perennial powerhouse Washington won the 6K race, finishing with 25 points to beat out Oregon, who scored 66 points. Stanford, Arizona, and Arizona State finished third through fifth, respectively, to ensure that the Pac-10 conference held the top five spots at the West Regionals.
USC’s lone chance for a representative at the NCAA Championships, junior Zsofia Erdelyi, started strong but faltered at the end to finish 28th overall, missing the cut to go run at nationals.
“She was playing catch up all year long,” Walsh said of Erdelyi. “But Zsofia realizes that with being sick and injured and being a month or six weeks behind everyone else, it’s hard to make up.”
Walsh was not making excuses for his team as a whole, however.
“We just didn’t get it done,” Walsh said. “It’s not like we didn’t know what to expect. They knew what they had to do. They just didn’t execute the way they were supposed to.”
After Erdelyi came junior Dina Kitayma, senior captain Bridget Helgerson, and freshman Christy Ambrosini, who replaced Christine Cortez because of Cortez’s shin injury. Walsh found some of Saturday’s few positives in the performances of Kitayama and Ambrosini.
“I thought our two newcomers ran very well,” Walsh said. “Dina and Christy both ran very well, especially considering how few collegiate races they’ve run. So we did have a few bright spots, but other than that, it was a rough day for us.”
Rounding out USC’s seven scoring runners were senior Katherine Ellis, freshman Kathleen Moloney, and junior Zara Lukens.
Despite the sudden drop off in performance from the Pac-10 Championships to Saturday’s West regional, Walsh insists the problem was tactical, not physical.
“You don’t run as well as we did at Pac-10’s and all of a sudden get out of shape in less than two weeks,” Walsh said. “I don’t think we over-trained or over-raced them because we ran really well at Pac-10’s as a group. But in this race, everyone except for Zsofia went out 25 to 30 seconds slower than they did at Pac-10’s.
“If you get stuck in the back and the pace is as slow as it was Saturday, then you’re dead,” Walsh said.
