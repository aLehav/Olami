An unassuming pad on Portland Street has housed 10 musicians for the last few years. One afternoon, the only people in the house were three friends comfortably sprawled out on the living room couches by the window facing the front yard. 
The trio comprises violinists and Thornton School of Music students Julian McClanahan, Nick Kennerly and Wynton Grant, three friends who are getting the chance to tour Europe with one of pop’s most talented producers, Rostam, for two weeks, with their first show on Wednesday. 
Rostam Batmanglij, known mononymously as Rostam, left his position as one of Vampire Weekend’s frontmen in 2016 to focus on solo work, which culminated in the release of his debut album Half-Light earlier this year. Rostam’s influence on Vampire Weekend and contemporary pop music is evident throughout the album, which features intricately tasteful string arrangements, blistering synthesizers and charming vocals. It is no wonder that pop and R&B’s smartest voices like Solange and Frank Ocean enlisted the veteran producer for their most recent projects.
The journey started with McClanahan’s storybook encounter and job offer. His admiration for Rostam over the years initially led him to attend Half-Light’s album release party and concert at Amoeba Records in Hollywood, where fans who purchased the album could have Rostam sign it. 
McClanahan, as he described it, decided to have a conversation with the producer when his copy was signed. In the heat of the moment, he asked Rostam to contact him if he ever needed strings players, a request that came in the form of a text the following week.
This interaction was completely unanticipated, according to McClanahan. 
“I didn’t go in intending on saying that,” McClanahan said. “It felt right in the moment and I ended up, like, impulsively just writing my name down on the back of this receipt with my number with a Sharpie.”
The trio’s most visible feature is its  members’ impeccable chemistry, which seems odd considering how Wynton explained that the three had only been playing together for a few weeks when they decided to assemble the group. In fact, they were thrilled to mention that their only recorded collaboration up until that point was a three-violin cover of Cardi B’s “Bodak Yellow” on YouTube.
The friends also compliment each other, often boasting of one another’s accomplishments if one of them thinks they have undersold themselves. Talking excitedly, Kennerly recounted Grant’s journey from obtaining his master’s degree at Yale University to beginning graduate work at USC to obtaining his first gig in Los Angeles on Shawn Mendes’ MTV Unplugged session. Over the last week, Kennerly said, the trio has opened for HAIM with Rostam at Los Angeles’ Greek Theatre, and Grant and McClanahan have played with Sabrina Claudio on The Late Late Show with James Corden.
“Let it be known for the record that for anyone that thinks you can just move to L.A. and just take off like that, it doesn’t really happen like that unless you’re Wynton,” Kennerly joked. 
Grant had a more personal take on his most recent run of success, which he attributed to his hardened work ethic and opportunistic nature. 
“You’ve got to put in the work and be ready […] when opportunity knocks, you open the door,” Grant said.
The opportunities, however, have not always presented themselves quite so plainly, Grant explained. He said that often finding opportunities requires immense self-motivation. 
“You have to go and seek out opportunity and knock and introduce yourself, or in Julian’s case, put your phone number on a ticket and there you go,” Grant said. 
Though the European leg is not the first the three have toured, they all believe it will provide an invaluable learning experience for them as musicians. For all three, observing Rostam’s detail-oriented approach to production and performances may be the most exciting prospect. Kennerly, in particular, admired both the breadth and depth of Rostam’s musicianship. 
“[He knows] the technical side just as much as he knows his vocals and the guitar voicings. The rounded musician that he is is very inspiring and something we can all look up to,” Kennerly said.
McClanahan, Kennerly and Grant will inevitably miss class time while on tour, but they are determined to stay on track with their schoolwork. Last semester, McClanahan was able to negotiate with his instructors enough to go on tour with electronic duo Mako and still finish the semester. Though their presence in the classroom will be missed, their education on the road has only begun.

From Thursday to Sunday, students can watch six original one-act plays written and directed by fellow Trojans at Brand New Theatre’s Fall 2017 One Act Festival at Massman Theatre, covering topics from encounters between ex-lovers to strangers making small talk on the subway. 
Founded in 1996, Brand New Theatre is USC’s oldest theater company. Every semester, the organization lives up to its motto “Dream It. Write It. See It,” as the committee overviews the original works of many student playwrights who applied through the organization’s website at the beginning of the semester. The six selected acts are organized into one show all directed and managed by students. 
“We do not pick the amount of one-acts prior to the submission deadline,” said BNT President Savannah Harrow, a senior majoring in theatre stage management. “Our team always says that we would rather produce one good one act than four one acts that are not as good.”
The six acts that will be performed this weekend are “Freddy & Olive,” written by Zoe Cheng, a junior majoring in screenwriting and columnist for the Daily Trojan; “Last Night in Town” by Julia Stier, a senior majoring in theatre; “Small Talk” by Charlie Junkins, a senior majoring in theatre and global studies; “Fruit Box” by Harrow; “Tull-Man” by Dan Toomey, a sophomore majoring in journalism; and “Two Steps Back” by Anastasia Barbato, a sophomore majoring in narrative studies. The order in which they will be presented was determined by BNT’s efforts to create a general story with the six one-acts based on the thematic through-line and a balancing of contrasting genres like drama and comedy.
Directed by Corrie Burkart, a junior majoring in theatre, “Freddy & Olive” centers around Freddy, who tries to find his sister-in-law Olive to get answers to a secret that he uncovers in his late wife’s rose garden. Under the direction of Ashley Busenlener, a junior majoring in theatre and dramatic arts, “Last Night in Town” finds two different people, Tatiana and Sirine, discussing their different lifestyles and the meaning of feeling fulfilled. Cary Reynolds, a senior majoring in theatre, directs “Small Talk,” a stage act in which characters Samar and Mike find something familiar about each other despite being completely different, all while riding the New York City subway.
“Fruit Box,” directed by Ali Appelbaum, a junior majoring in theatre, deals with former lovers Rose and Kayley’s awkward attempt to move on. Director Rachael McNamara, a senior majoring in theatre, has audiences follow Charlotte in “Tull-Man,” as she has to both care for her father Francis while a new family member Tolman enters both of their lives. When audiences see “Two Steps Back,” directed by Shane Munson, a sophomore majoring in screenwriting, they will watch as miscommunication affects college graduate Jeremy’s attempts to re-enter his peers’ dating scene.
Each of the plays seeks to find commonalities between the characters, even if they are vastly different from each other. According to Harrow, this overlying thematic element came naturally with the ideas that students submitted when applying to be part of this event. She allowed the student playwrights to write about subjects that interest them, and for her, the results have never disappointed. Those working on these plays have something that they want the audience to take away from the production.
“I hope the audience looks at strangers differently,” Junkins said about his play “Small Talk.” “I hope the audience looks at strangers as nuanced individuals who are each the center of his or her own story, and that a stranger’s story is just as human as their own. I believe this is the first step to cultivating empathetic perspectives and combating violence.”
A suggested $5 donation can be made as one enters the door. Prior to Thursday, Brand New Theatre set up a fundraising page on Generosity.com where people could donate as they wish to help fund this event. The student-run organization included incentives to encourage donations such as two complimentary tickets for a $25 donation. The fundraiser’s description states the donations will go toward the costs associated with simultaneously producing six distinct shows.
The first show will be held at 7:30 p.m. Thursday. On Friday, the showings will be at 7:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. On Saturday, there will be two chances to see these six acts at 2:30 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. while the last opportunity will be on Sunday at 2:30 p.m.

USC administrators along with Alya and Gary Michelson, for whom the Michelson Center is named, participated in the official ribbon-cutting ceremony for what is now the largest building on USC’s campus. Photo by Wanting He | Daily Trojan
The so-called “University of Summer Construction” has officially worked its way into fall with the opening of a new building — and it happens to be the campus’ largest, taking up an entire block on McClintock Boulevard.
President C. L. Max Nikias, the Board of Trustees, University senior officers, faculty and students celebrated the opening of the USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience on Wednesday afternoon. 
The ceremony honored orthopedic spinal surgeon, inventor and philanthropist Gary K. Michelson and his wife, Alya Michelson. They donated $50 million to the University to build Michelson Hall.
During his remarks at the ceremony, Gary Michelson offered to give an additional donation of $100 million, bringing their gift to $150 million to strengthen USC’s efforts in convergent medical research.
“We would like to double down on our previous gift to build what would be the leading center in the entire world for convergent medical research, and populate it with the most brilliant scientists from around the entire world, with the exception of the ones we’ve already taken,” Gary Michelson said.
An interdisciplinary initiative from the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, USC Viterbi School of Engineering and the Keck School of Medicine of USC, Michelson Hall brings together scientists and engineers in its 190,000-square-foot space. According to a USC press release, the building is the biggest and most complex ever constructed on the University Park Campus.
In his opening remarks, Nikias praised the center’s collaborative spirit.
“Now we have this magnificent new center for a new way to do biosciences and biotech research,” Nikias said. “Everything about it compels interaction because this is a building without borders.”
Michelson Hall will unite around 30 researchers from over 11 disciplines. Together, they will advance research related to new drug therapies, high-tech diagnostics and biomedical devices.
USC Dornsife Dean Amber Miller and USC Viterbi Dean Yannis Yortsos discussed the future opportunities the building will hold.
“In this new space, leading minds tie the very threads of bioscience research together,” Miller said. “For this reason, the Michelson Center will serve as a critical hub for researchers across our USC campuses. This space will support existing collaborations and spark new ones.” 
Undergraduate students will also benefit from the new building, which will host the Bridge Undergraduate Science program. According to its website, BUGS is a “cross-disciplinary research program supporting efforts that improve the understanding of the human body, or enable technologies that can be applied toward these efforts.”
Nikias presented Gary Michelson with an honorary doctorate degree before cutting the ribbon with Michelson’s family and University officials, signifying the building’s opening. After the ceremony concluded, attendees walked through the new hall. 
Gary Michelson was appreciative of the support he received from the USC community.
“Alya and I would like to thank President Nikias, Provost Quick, the Board of Trustees, everyone at USC for allowing us to be a small part of a creation of what I think is a world-class research center,” Gary Michelson said.
 
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Gary Michelson offered to donate an additional $50 million to the University. He actually offered to donate an additional $100 million. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Mosaic Student Communities, the property management arm of Mosaic Investment Partners, has opened its first virtual reality lounge to facilitate tours of its houses in local neighborhoods for USC students. The company manages properties throughout University Park; and its offices are located on Hoover Street.
The use of virtual reality has become increasingly popular among real estate firms, as well as at college campuses across the nation. According to Mosaic, this is the first time that USC students will interact with the technology to tour prospective housing near campus. 
The VR lounge allows students to tour homes by wearing goggles, navigating through the homes by using handheld remote controls. Once the goggles are on, students will be able to look around and see an exact simulation of the properties. 
“One of the things that we’ve realized is that actually touring all of the houses is intrusive,” said Troy Dodgion, Mosaic’s director of operations. “People don’t like to have people come in and look at their house all the time during leasing season.” 
The remote controls are easy to use and allow students to walk up and down stairs and into a variety of rooms in the house, instead of having to attend an in-person tour.
“Also, [walk-in tours are] really time consuming — applicants have to come to the Mosaic house first and then we have to drive them around to look at the six or seven houses that they want to see,” Dodgion said. “This way, they’re able to come in here and look at some of the houses to get an idea of what they’re looking for without us bothering the tenants and the incoming residents. They get an opportunity to see a wider range of houses and get to pick one that’s the best suited for them before we actually go out and start looking at the physical houses.” 
Mosaic paired up with Transported, a company based in Santa Monica that films all of the virtual reality footage. It also uses a virtual reality system called Oculus Rift to create the tours, which Dodgion describes as the “highest-end VR equipment that’s out there,” according to their website 
So far, Mosaic has applied the technology to around eight of its Victorian-style homes. Not only does it aim to eventually implement virtual reality to tour for its whole housing portfolio, but it is also always looking to acquire new properties for students to rent. 
The company aims to renovate poorly maintained homes and homes in need of development, and it manages a variety of homes at Cal Poly Pomona and UC Berkeley.
Mosaic Student Communities will host a launch party on Nov. 9 from 6 to 9 p.m. to celebrate and reveal its new lounge and services. 
Very informative and interesting! Great work Natalie!
Thank you for the article! The party is actually today, November 2nd! Come and join us.

The USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and VICE Media will launch a new class in Spring 2018 about VICELAND’s Emmy-nominated documentary series WOMAN, with Gloria Steinem, to learn about gender representation in the media. The class will incorporate guest speakers and episodes from the eight-part documentary series as well as media images from the 20th century to the present to explore gender’s relationship with power, voice, race, socioeconomic status and sexual orientation. Students will also learn how to use their own media for social change.
Students will learn about the process followed to create the series in order to understand how to create their own media. Such parts of the process will include pitching, shaping and production, among others. The work produced by the students will be published on VICE’s site Broadly, which focuses on women’s issues and experiences.
“By the conclusion of the class, our hope is that students will have a project to enact social change,” professor and Vice Dean of USC Annenberg Sarah Banet-Weiser told USC News. “Beyond that, they’ll have an understanding of the cultural representations of gender identity and ways to practice storytelling in the context of disenfranchised communities. They will have a deeper knowledge of institutional policies that create barriers or avenues to social justice.”
WOMAN conveys violence against women in different parts of the world through reporting by on-site correspondents and emphasizes the need for viewers to take action to create change. The documentary includes feminist writers and activists Gloria Steinem and Amy Richards. This is the first VICE documentary to be used as a teaching tool for higher education.

After last week’s bounceback win over Arizona State, the football team took to the practice field Wednesday ahead of a pivotal home game against 23rd-ranked Arizona. Coming off of four straight wins, the Wildcats are a hot team with an explosive offense. As both teams have just one conference loss, the winner of this game will be in pole position to take the Pac-12 South.
Potent Wildcats
In four games since Arizona quarterback Khalil Tate took over the offense, Arizona has averaged 48.75 points per game, including 58 against 25th-ranked Washington State last week.
“The numbers speak for themselves, and they play up to those numbers,” defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said. “They’re a really good running attack, and their offensive line is very well-coached. I think their running backs work really well in unison with the offensive line, cutting off certain techniques and blocks. They force you to defend all 11 players.”
Head coach Clay Helton agreed. 
“Not only is this a very explosive offense, it’s also an offense that plays with extreme tempo at times,” Helton said. 
Helton said that the defense prepared for Arizona’s quick attack with a drill called “fastball,” where the offense runs plays as fast as possible. 
“Arizona does an exceptional job, especially after explosive plays, trying to get to that tempo really fast,” Helton said. “There’s no time to catch your breath because the next play is coming.”
Tate is an electrifying runner, leading the nation with 13.4 yards per carry. He already has 926 rushing yards and eight rushing touchdowns on the season. His blinding speed has made for numerous highlight plays, like his 82-yard touchdown last week. He’s also a capable passer, having thrown for 784 yards on 11.7 yards per attempt and six touchdowns.
In response to Tate’s athleticism, sophomore linebacker Jordan Iosefa will move to the edge. Iosefa, a great athlete in his own right, said Tate is a great player.
“We’ve got to be able to contain him, keep him inside the box, and we’ll be fine,” Iosefa said.
Stephen Carr Primed for Return
After missing multiple games with a foot injury, freshman running back Stephen Carr has gotten more practice work this week.
“He’s looking very promising for the game in some type of capacity,” Helton said. “I don’t see him getting a ton of plays, but it looks like he’s leaning toward being available Saturday.”

The men’s basketball team, coming off a 26-10 season in 2016, earned a spot at No. 10 in the AP preseason poll released early Wednesday morning. The Trojans’ spot at No. 10 marked the program’s highest preseason ranking since the 1974-75 season. 
By earning 995 points in the poll, USC sits just 52 points below 2017 national champion No. 9 North Carolina and 511 points below third-ranked Pac-12 frontrunner Arizona. Crosstown rival UCLA earned 340 points, good for No. 21 and the third-highest ranking in a conference that lost a lot of talent this past offseason with Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, Lauri Markkanen, Kyle Kuzma and Ivan Rabb declaring for the NBA Draft. 
USC’s No. 10 ranking comes after the Trojans’ deep run in the 2017 NCAA tournament as well as a loaded roster that returns all five starters. Along with a former five-star recruit in sophomore transfer Derryck Thornton, head coach Andy Enfield also welcomes freshman newcomers Jordan Usher, Charles O’Bannon, Jr. and Victor Uyaelunmo to a squad with an already deep bench.
Considering USC didn’t receive any votes in last year’s AP preseason poll, this high ranking is yet another milestone in Enfield’s career, which has not only featured USC’s first postseason appearance since 2011 but also the program’s first NCAA tournament win since 2009. 
Though this is the first time in decades that USC has been ranked this high in the preseason, in Week 8 of last year’s AP poll, the undefeated 13-0 Trojans earned a No. 22 rankings before slipping out of the poll for the rest of the year. A knee injury to star forward Bennie Boatwright was a large reason for the drop, keeping the then-sophomore forward out of key Pac-12 games. 
With Boatwright and the rest of these starters healthy for the beginning of the season, the Trojans look to stay high in the top 25 throughout the season. USC opens its season against Cal State Fullerton on Nov. 10, and the team’s first test against a ranked opponent comes Thanksgiving weekend in a home tilt with No. 25 Texas A&M (Nov. 26) — a team that the Trojans went on the road to beat by 2 points last season after being down 7 with less than four minutes remaining in the game.
Two other non-conference battles with SMU (Dec. 2) and Oklahoma (Dec. 8) could have major poll implications considering both opponents earned points in the preseason poll. But before USC can think about its post-Oklahoma ranking, the squad must first overcome unranked Big West foe Cal State Fullerton at its home opener, which tips off at 7 p.m. next Friday.
There are two Trojan players whose family are involved with the bribery scandal that could be ineligible
for the season.
Based upon past history of NCAA delayed timing of sanctions – any NCAA penalty ruling would likely take effect NEXT season.  Could be the involved players are ruled ineligible themselves and/or USC as a team is ruled ineligible for post-season tournament play next year, something else, or nothing at all since those charged are not the players or their families but the agents/recruiters.  We shall see soon.

Brandon Holt has enjoyed a strong fall season, earing the No. 2 seed at the ITA National Fall Championships. Photo by Jo Danielle Esteban | Daily Trojan
As the collegiate fall tennis season nears its close this week, one lone Trojan takes to Palm Desert, Calif., for the inaugural Oracle ITA National Fall Championships, which began on Wednesday and will run through Sunday. 
Sophomore Brandon Holt entered the singles main draw as the No. 2 seed. He secured the coveted spot (one of 64 total available) by taking home the title at the ITA Oracle Masters Championship in September.
Holt began the tournament against unseeded Mitch Harper of Virginia Tech, rolling past his opponent in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2. He will face Florida State’s unseeded Lucas Poullain in the round of 32.
Holt’s win on Wednesday continued the sophomore’s strong fall campaign, which included September’s Oracle ITA Masters win in Malibu, Calif. Holt also entered as the top seed last weekend, when the Trojans hosted the SoCal Intercollegiate Championships at Marks Stadium, entering eight men in the singles draw as well as three doubles pairs.
While Holt was able to battle his way to the final hurdle in the singles bracket, he couldn’t take it all home, falling 6-3, 6-4 in the championship to Oliver Frank of Azusa Pacific. However, it was on the doubles side where the Trojans truly stole the stage. Out of 16 teams in the doubles main draw, USC took both spots in the championship, pitting the duo of redshirt junior Tanner Smith and junior Laurens Verboven against redshirt sophomore Jake DeVine and junior Logan Smith. In the end, Verboven and Tanner Smith overcame their stiff competition in an 8-3 decision.
Once Holt returns from his trip to Palm Desert, USC will head to Palos Verdes, Calif., for its final tournament of the fall season. The Jack Kramer Invitational begins on Nov. 10 and runs through Nov. 13.

The Houston Astros smacked in two runs in the first inning and three in the second. From there, the game was clutched with some sort of terrible inevitability, as if the entire city of Houston was clinging on for dear life to meet the destiny predicted on a Sports Illustrated cover years ago.
Watching this game, I couldn’t help but reminisce on two years ago, when my own hometown Kansas City Royals took home the pennant. In remembering that joy, I felt I understood the Houston fans more than any other fanbase in any recent finals. I remembered being in their shoes and feeling that our team, more than anything, needed to win.
When the Royals went to the World Series in 2014, there was a feeling of change. People wore blue wherever they went. Seemingly overnight, multiple brands boomed by producing shirts, hats and socks emblazoned with different logos and centered on our pride for our city. It didn’t matter that we didn’t win that year — the series breathed life into my city, which had been struggling to reshape and redefine itself for years.
And the next year, when we did win, the entire city seemed to hum with pride. I was 1,500 miles away in my dorm room in Parkside, but I watched with envy as everyone in Kansas City canceled work and school to flood Downtown in Royal blue to welcome home the athletes we revered as heroes and loved in a way that felt something like family.
Cities like mine need our teams. We live for our teams, rally around them even when things are unbearable. And even though it’s bigger than my hometown, Houston truly needed its team this year.
In the wake of the natural disasters that rocked Houston to its core, our country saw that city come together to both grieve and rebuild. At the heart of this unity was a source of unlikely inspiration and support: the sports community. The Astros, once a nobody team that barely competed nationally, began a rise that lit up a city desperate for life.
There’s a beautiful power to sports, that thing that keeps us coming back, and it’s always hard to put into words until we see moments like the one on Wednesday night. Out of the millions of reasons to love sports — the violence, the beauty, the grace, the athleticism — the thing that we all admit to loving the most is the heart.
This series, and Wednesday night in particular, reminded us of this heart. Sports are at their best when they unite and inspire, and through every extra inning game and moment of insanity, the Astros did exactly that. They gave sports fans, both of their team and throughout the league, the chance to rejoice in the power that sports have off the field and outside of the stadium.
So congratulations, Houston. Your whole city deserved this. I hope the celebration lasts for a long while.

Kylie Cheung | Daily Trojan
In a Tuesday feature in New York Magazine, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, seemed to offer a head-scratching stance on whether one can simultaneously be a feminist and an opponent of abortion rights. 
Citing how he and his pro-choice wife get along perfectly well despite their disagreement on whether the government should be allowed to force women to push out babies, the 65-year-old man insisted, “Everybody ought to just take a chill pill.”
In essence, why can’t we just agree to disagree? Why can’t the social justice warriors and American Civil Liberties Union crusaders put down their pitchforks and just agree to disagree with lawmakers who are codifying their beliefs into reckless, dangerous abortion bans? Kasich’s callous suggestion that everyone should calm down highlights a frightening disparity in power. 
When lawmakers “agree to disagree” with the women they’re hurting, they can still go on to pass and implement legislation that controls the most intimate aspects of women’s lives. When women “agree to disagree” with their lawmakers, this means passively ceding their bodily autonomy. One group, but not the other, suffers from this disagreement. One group, but not the other, is told that their right to decision-making power over their bodies is less important than an unborn fetus, less worthy of protection than a conservative legislator’s fragile sense of moral superiority.
Kasich is held in high esteem across the political spectrum as a moderate and “decent” Republican at a time when the party is increasingly being infiltrated by self-identified neo-Nazis. But what his liberal sympathizers seem to forget is that he opposes legal abortion except in cases of rape or incest — a stance that acknowledges rape is wrong, but regards reproductive coercion as just peachy.
He also has a record of voting against the legal transportation of minors out of state to access safe, legal abortion care during his tenure in the U.S. Congress, and promising to nominate only anti-abortion judges and court justices. Last year, Kasich signed a bill that sweepingly banned 20-week abortions in the state of Ohio into law. The law is not only recognized as unconstitutional by the ACLU and contradictory to Roe v. Wade’s guarantee of the right to safe, legal abortion until fetal viability at roughly 24-26 weeks. It’s also particularly cruel considering its disproportionate, life-threatening consequences for women seeking late-term abortion care due to health concerns or fetal abnormalities, the vast majority of whom are seeking abortions at 20 weeks. 
The takeaway here is that despite Kasich’s insistence that we all need to calm down, that activists and women with unwanted pregnancies ought to quit fighting abortion opponents and take “chill pills,” he has ironically played a decisive, unforgivable role in creating the sources of their justifiable panic. Feminists aren’t inventing and imagining women’s rights crises just to march in the streets for fun.

The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world, with higher rates in states with more restrictions on abortion, according to data from the September 2016 issue of the Obstetrics & Gynecology journal. The last five years have accounted for more than one quarter of all abortion restrictions passed across the country since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, according to Guttmacher Institute. And according to the same Obstetrics & Gynecology research, the estimated U.S. maternal mortality rate grew by 27 percent between 2000 and 2014. Presently, about 90 percent of all U.S. counties lack an abortion provider, and with women about twice as likely as men to live in poverty, burdening women with the costs of travel and lodging to have what can already be an expensive procedure certainly doesn’t help.
These are real problems that, frankly, only people privileged enough to not have a direct stake in this issue can be calm and passive about. It’s difficult for women with unintended pregnancies, or women in general, to look away from direct threats to their bodily autonomy and pleasantly agree to disagree. It’s difficult for decent people to look at this public health and humanitarian crisis, shrug and pop a “chill pill.”
As for that divisive question of whether feminists are practicing elitist, ideological exclusivity by suggesting that abortion opponents can’t be feminists, it all goes back to whether you think the fundamental human right to a safe abortion is something that can be compromised on. Let’s also not forget that feminism is about inclusivity and empowerment of different types of people, and that there’s a very specific type of person that opposition to abortion rights targets: low-income women of color. 
Historically, lacking the same access to family planning resources of wealthy white women, low-income immigrant and minority women were more likely to suffer from unsafe, illegal back-alley abortions. This remains true today amid the Republican crusade on women’s health centers like Planned Parenthood, which, to set the record straight, offer services and resources that are more likely to prevent an unintended pregnancy that may lead to an abortion than abstinence education, according to research from the American Journal of Public Health published last month. 
Research repeatedly shows that restrictions and both legal and economic barriers to abortion, in their myriad forms, don’t affect the rate at which abortions occur. Rather, they burden women with costs and wasted time, or even endanger some women by pushing them to go to unsafe sources for abortions. 
Those are the circumstances that “feminists” against abortion are subjecting some of the most vulnerable members of society to. And I’d like to emphasize that banning abortion won’t stop it from happening. These restrictions achieve nothing but the punishment of women, so the only takeaway for abortion opponents is one of pure selfishness — the gentle stroking of their moral superiority complexes. 
On Monday, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly took to the podium to speak favorably of Robert E. Lee, Confederate general and supporter of the torture of black Union captives. He claimed the Civil War could easily have been dodged by compromise, that there were “good people” on “both sides.” 
The words were appalling, especially from a man who, like Kasich, has made his name as a respectable, decent man. His comments about the possibility of a Civil War compromise — one that would most likely have decided whether or not non-white human beings are, in fact, human beings — imply that pacifying white supremacy in its purest, oldest form, just for the sake of avoiding war would have been a noble feat.
Calls to listen to both sides and make compromises have become increasingly glamorized since the election of President Donald Trump, a man who thinks NFL players who protest police brutality are “sons of b-tches,” but some neo-Nazis are “very fine people.” By no means is the well-meaning, centrist proverb of reaching across the aisle always wrong. But it can also be deeply damaging, as it buries a fundamental truth: Human rights are not something we can compromise on. Whether humans have ownership of and autonomy over their own bodies is different from a proposed tax plan — we can’t merely “agree to disagree” on something this fundamental.

A 2017 Marist poll continues to find that a very significant majority of Americans (and the majority of women) support restrictions on abortion.  This author is out of touch.
Really? The Marists are an anti-abortion religious organization with strong feelings on this matter, and unlikely to be objective in their poll. Their religious dogma could well have driven that poll’s results. More impartial polls by non-parochial universities and news organizations have found for many years just the opposite. Most Americans, and certainly most women, consider the decision about an abortion to be between a woman and her doctor.
Not so.  Here’s another from Pew Research  ” more than half of U.S. adults take a non-absolutist position, saying that in most – but not all – cases, abortion should be legal (33%) or illegal (24%). Fewer take the position that in all cases abortion should be either legal (25%) or illegal (16%).”  
Therefore, only 25% believe that abortion should be legal in all cases, so 75% support some restrictions on the right to abortion.
Murder your offspring all you want, but don’t make others pay for it. That’s not social justice.
Understandable position, Lunderful. But a few questions:
1. Do you really want a meth, crack or fetal alcohol baby with scrambled brains, unloved, unwanted, who has a future as a drag on society, or as violent career criminal, out on the street? The circumstances of an abortion instead, yes, are awful, but the lesser of the two evils.
2. For a fetus in utero who will be born hideously deformed and without a brain,yet who can live a few months at great expense, and with great horror for the family, would abortion not be a preferable situation?
3. How about the violent rape of an innocent 12 year old? She should be required to carry the fetus to term?
4. And if any of these are biological mothers are too poor, would it not be better for society to pay for the abortion than let these babies be born?
5. The image of a cuddly, lovable, pretty little baby vs. aborting it? I get it. But that is not the only possible situation where abortion might be under consideration.
OK – permit the “therapeutic” abortions you describe, but eliminate vanity and convenience based abortions.  That way 92% of the babies survive.
I get your concept. But who is to decide if an abortion is for vanity and convenience? You or I cannot know the circumstances when an abortion is under consideration. It is a matter to be kept confidential and decided between the woman and her doctor. This is no decision for you, me, or some outside politician.
I read your articles and always find some wisdom in them, even when I disagree. In this article, I find nothing but wisdom.

Regarding the Monday Daily Trojan feature, “International Students: Living in Two Worlds,” I believe that it is time for the University to pay more attention to a quarter of the student body at one of the top schools for international students.
I am an alumnus living abroad, and have noted numerous disparities between USC’s advertisement of the international student experience and the reality.
One disparity seems to exist in the lack of scholarships offered to international students. Since 1995, there have been four Rhodes Scholars selected from USC. Two of them were international students. That is above the percentage of international students in the USC population, so international students have been carrying the school in this competition. 
But a casual look at USC’s scholarship and financial aid page shows no information for Rhodes Scholar applicants from five of the top countries of origins, China, India, Canada, Germany and Hong Kong. There is no information on the Commonwealth Scholarship for Australian and Canadian Ph.D. applicants; the Chevening Scholarship for many, countries; and the prestigious Pierre Elliott Trudeau, National Sciences and Engineering Research Council and Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council scholarships and grants for students from Canada either. Our common goal at USC is academics, but not everyone is given the same path to success.
Finally — and this should be obvious to the University — there should be an internationalization of the academic environment, apart from its people. This may not mean pushing for an international core curriculum, but I would like to see students try.  But look at USC’s language offerings, which for a school that boasts one of the country’s largest international student populations, offers only 14 languages. There is no Cantonese offered for students wanting to learn more about Hong Kong. There is no Catalan for those inspired by the recent events in Spain. By contrast, UCLA offers language instruction in more than 49 languages, more than three times USC’s number.
In short, there is a lot of contradiction between the statistics and my experience.

Excellent insight Gary because simply being an international student is difficult, on top of our already complex culture and language. Assimilation assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on their life’s journey. Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow students, and even informative books to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.
   An award-winning worldwide book/ebook that might be of help to anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” Used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors, it identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they’ve contributed to our society, including students.
   A chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture, friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work with/for an American firm here or overseas.
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here.
   Good luck to all at USC or wherever you study or wherever you come from, because that is the TRUE spirit of the American PEOPLE, not a few in government who have the loudest voice!
