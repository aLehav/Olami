Alumnus Paul Beigelman donated Friday $25,000 to the School of Social Work to create a scholarship for graduate students who plan on entering the health profession.
The scholarship is in honor of Beigelman’s late wife, Irene Beigelman, who was also a graduate of the university.
Beigelman cited the importance of the field of social work as a reason for his monetary contribution.
“Social workers do exceptionally important work,” Beigelman said. “I saw my wife doing it. I’m glad to help them in any way I can.
Judith Axonovitz, director of the school’s Skirball Academic Center and a clinical professor of field education, said Beigelman’s scholarship emphasis on the health field identifies an important aspect in the field of social work.
“We teach our students that it’s a holistic approach in treating our clients, and Dr. Beigelman saw that as well,” Axonovitz said in a statement.
Beigelman earned his medical degree at USC in 1948 and his wife graduated from the School of Social Work in 1957. Beigelman said that his enduring dedication to the university prompted his donation.
Though Beigelman has worked at many universities, he has maintained close ties with USC. Beigelman received his medical degree from the Keck School of Medicine and has completed his internship at the Los Angeles County + USC Medical Center.
“Next to my family, USC is the No. 1 recipient of favors of my trust,” Beigelman said. “I bleed cardinal and gold.”
Both Beigelman and his wife made an impact on improving the health of youth and the underprivileged. Paul Beigelman specializes in diabetes care for underprivileged populations. Irene Beigelman worked with the Children’s Bureau, a federal bureau aimed at improving the lives of vulnerable children and their families.
According to the U.S. News & World Report, the School of Social Work was ranked as the eleventh best social-work graduate programs. The masters program can be completed in two, three or four years.
Beigelman said that he hopes his donation will contribute to the future success of the school.
“I’m determined to do my bit to keep USC where it belongs in the top ranks. I want to spread the good stuff around. What is money for if not to do some good?” Beigelman said.

Students might soon get used to plays spontaneously popping up around campus, as USC Libraries and the School of Dramatic Arts has partnered up to launch a new series of flash plays.
Director Jonathan Munoz-Proulx, who is also a recent graduate of the School of Dramatic Arts, said the first flash play, was held Thursday.
The play was held outside Doheny Library and was inspired by the quotes along the walls of the library. Flash plays, similar to popular flash mobs, seemed to be a natural fit for the series, Munoz-Proulx said.
“The key is to keep talking, keep moving, so that we are constantly pulling focus and attention and keeping the audience engaged,” Munoz-Proulx said. “It’s a very spontaneous, off-the-cuff, somewhat improvised experiment — just embracing the spontaneity of what might happen in the moment.”
Flash play organizers said a central goal of the series is to engage the student body and incorporate more student involvement with the libraries on campus.
“I meet a lot of students who don’t realize we have libraries other than Doheny or Leavey,” said Catherine Quinlan, dean of USC Libraries, who was co-organizer of the series. “If we presented the library in an exciting and innovative way to our student body, we might have a really good chance of having them come to us.”
Oliver Mayer, a professor in the School of Dramatic Arts who was also a co-organizer, said the series will make the library seem more exciting.
“The idea is to have fun and alert, particularly, the undergraduates to how cool the libraries are and that the libraries are there for them,” Mayer said.
Mayer said that he expects the number of plays in the series to eventually exceed 20, matching the number of libraries at USC. The frequency of the plays is planned to increase this August, as students return for the fall semester.
“The idea is that each play will relate to the [specific] library, but my hope is that it will be in an unexpected way, not just a straight-down-the-middle, obvious thing,” Mayer said.
Quinlan said the series will ideally draw more crowds to the library.
“I thought, ‘why can’t we combine creativity and the element of surprise,’ which really is what libraries are all about in my mind,” Quinlan said.
A mix of undergraduates, alumni and celebrity actors, including David Zayas, an actor on the television series Dexter,  will contribute to this project, Though many people are involved in strengthening the series, Mayer stressed the role undergraduates have in contributing to the stories.
“We’re going to have a bunch of people come in and do stuff just to get people excited,” Mayer said.
“But the primary goal is to have undergrads do this work.”
Quinlan said USC Libraries has tried drawing more students in through exhibits, such as the fractal display in the lobby of Doheny which opened in September 2012. However. she hopes this series will prompt students to consider libraries in a new light and inspire creativity in the libraries’ outreach programs.
“I’m hoping that doing this will spur some other ideas from other people about how we can continue to bring the library to the students in a way that makes them surprised about what we can do,” Quinlan said.
Mayer noted that the theme of the series fits well with the overall mission of USC to offer an interdisciplinary experience to students.
“This is probably the beginning of the relationship between the School of Dramatic Arts and the libraries,” Mayer said, “but it’s really what President [C. L. Max] Nikias and Provost [Elizabeth] Garrett want from our schools, our faculty and our student — to be able to connect, be interdisciplinary and have fun doing it.”

Nederlander Concerts has entered a deal with the Galen Center at the University Park Campus to book more concerts at the venue, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Busy venue · The Galen Center has hosted events including concerts by Drake and Kendrick Lamar as well as its usual slate of sporting events. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The deal came after the announcement that the Gibson Amphitheatre at Universal City will close in September to make way for a new Harry Potter attraction at Universal Studios.
Nederlander Chief Executive Alex Hodges told the Los Angeles Times that the Galen Center would fulfill a need for indoor concert spaces previously provided by the Gibson Amphitheatre.
“This gives us an indoor place for those shows that need to be indoors, and for winter months it gives us the opportunity to replace some of the shows that would be at Gibson on a 12-month basis,” Hodges said.
Nederlander Concerts holds events at several venues in Los Angeles, including the Pantages Theatre and the Greek Theatre.
The Galen Center, located at the southeast corner Figueroa Street and Jefferson Boulevard, can seat audiences 10,258 patrons. The arena has hosted the university’s home basketball and volleyball games, along with several large-scale events including the 2012 and 2013 Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards, auditions for the third season of Fox’s The X-Factor and performances by Drake, Kendrick Lamar and A$AP Rocky.
Businessman and university trustee Louis Galen and his wife, Helene, donated $50 million to enable the development of the Galen Center. Construction of the area and pavilion began in October 2004 and cost an estimated $147 million, according to the USC Trojan Athletic website. The Galen Center opened in October 2006 and hosted its first event, a women’s volleyball game between USC and Stanford University, on Oct. 12, 2006.
Before the Galen Center was built, USC basketball games were played at several locations, including the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and the Shrine Auditorium stage.

More than 600 alumni gathered Saturday night in Downtown Los Angeles’ Westin Bonaventure Hotel for the 80th Annual Alumni Award, honoring seven outstanding alumni for their achievements and service to the university.
The Asa V. Call Alumni Achievement Award, the highest alumni honor, was given to ’84 Marshall School of Business alumnus Frank Fertitta III.
Recognition · Asa V. Coll Alumni Achievement Award recipient Frank Fertitta III, ‘84, delivers his acceptance speech Saturday night. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
 
Fertitta joins the ranks of past recipients including school namesakes Ronald Tutor, Andrew Viterbi, Gordon Marshall, as well as Neil A. Armstrong.
“I have always been proud to be a Trojan. I am humbled and honored to be in the company of the distinguished past recipients of this award,” Fertitta said.
The event atmosphere, inspired by the Hollywood Bowl, featured live music by the Chamber Singers and a jazz quartet from the Thornton School of Music.
Fertitta praised his alma mater for its progress throughout the decades, emphasizing his appreciation with a “fight on” to the audience.
“USC is a great institution — we all know that,” Fertitta said. “I have been amazed to see the progress since I graduated. Not just in terms of physical facilities [and] the campus itself, but more importantly in terms of the excellence of the academic programs.”
Geraldine Knatz, who received her master’s degree in 1977 and doctorate degree in 1979 and is the first female executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, was one of the honorees of the Alumni Merit Award, which is given to those whose accomplishments reflect the range and quality of the university’s education.
“Once at USC, I was hooked,” Knatz said of the university in her acceptance speech.
Knatz, who received her master’s degree in environmental engineering and doctorate degree in biological science, was responsible for creating and implementing the San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action Plan, which has reduced port emissions by 60 percent.
Mark Ridley-Thomas, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors for the 2nd District, was also a recipient of the Alumni Merit Award. With a doctorate degree in social ethics from the university, he spearheaded the opening of the new Martin Luther King Jr. Hospital.
Alumni Barbara Cotler, Linda Givvin and Jerry Neely received the Alumni Service Award, which is given to those who demonstrate outstanding volunteer efforts on behalf of USC.
Cotler was recognized for establishing the Ken Cotler Scholarship fund, which is given to the most outstanding bands member of the Spirit of Troy. Together, both Cotler and her husband established WITFAWN Tours, a travel firm that has grown to serve nearly 2,000 Trojans.
Givvin was recognized for her work as a member of the university’s Alumni Association Board of Governors and as a past president of the Town and Gown of USC.
Neely, a member of the university’s Board of Trustees since 1981, was recognized for his work with the Marshall School of Business and for creating with his wife the Jerry and Nancy Neely Chair in American Enterprise. Both he and his wife endowed two chairs in the Marshall school.
In recognition of alumni under the age of 35 who have had outstanding achievements, the Young Alumni Merit Award was presented to six-time Olympic medalist swimmer Rebecca Soni.
Soni, an ’09 graduate from the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism who most recently won gold and silver medals at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, was acknowledged for her work as a supporter for the United Nations Foundation’s Girl Up campaign. The campaign encourages girls to become world leaders by raising awareness and funds for United Nations programs.
Soni attributed her success to the unrelenting support she received from the Trojan Family.
“I felt your [Trojan Family] commitment,” Soni said to the audience. “Your pride in me has lifted me up and given me so much joy. Sharing my accomplishments with you has really made everything feel twice as strong. Sometimes I didn’t know if I was racing for team USA or team USC.”

For any national champion, the pressure to repeat is intense. Though the USC men’s tennis team, the winner of the last four national championships, has demonstrated a capability to defend its titles all season long, this weekend was an exception to the rule. The Trojans faltered against No. 1 UCLA, falling 4-2 in the Pac-12 championships in Ojai, Calif.
The No. 5 Trojans (23-4, 5-1 Pac-12) were slotted as the second seed                            in the Pac-12 championships after surrendering the regular-season      Pac-12 title to their crosstown rivals, the UCLA Bruins (24-1, 7-0 Pac-12).
In that matchup, the Trojans won the doubles point, but the Bruins were too sharp in singles to be overcome and notched a 4-3 win over USC in the final match of the regular season. USC was seeded second in last year’s tournament as well, but pulled off a victory against UCLA to take home the Pac-12 championship title.
In this year’s tournament, the Trojans enjoyed a first-round bye before taking on fourth-seeded California (14-9, 5-1) in the semifinals. When the teams met earlier this season, USC did not drop a set en route to a 7-0 beatdown of the Bears.
This time around, the Trojans opened up the match by conceding the doubles point but turned it around and moved on to the finals with a 4-1 victory. The day belonged to the Trojan sophomores, with straight-set wins coming from sophomores Yannick Hanfmann, Roberto Quiroz and Eric Johnson along with a comeback victory by sophomore Jonny Wang.
Throughout the tournament, USC was without the talents of junior co-captain Emilio Gomez, ranked No. 4 in the nation by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association, and freshman standout Max de Vroome. Both are nursing injuries and trying to get healthy in time for the NCAA tournament, and though they both competed in doubles play, they sat out in singles, which may have been the deciding factor in USC’s 4-2 loss to UCLA in the finals of the Pac-12 tournament.
“We knew it was going to be tough regardless of whether or not Emilio and Max could have played,” Wang said. “But we put that aside and focused on our matches rather than worrying.”
The Trojans acquired an early lead against the Bruins behind strong doubles wins by Hanfmann and junior co-captain Ray Sarmiento on court one and de Vroome and Johnson on court three. USC extended its lead to 2-0 when No. 65 Hanfmann upset UCLA’s No. 18 Marcos Giron 6-4, 6-1.
That was to be the Trojans’ last point of the day, though, as the Bruins roared back to capture the next four singles matches.
UCLA’s Karue Sell, the only unranked player on either team in singles, defeated No. 94 junior co-captain Michael Grant 6-3, 6-1 while UCLA’s No. 24 Adrien Puget took down No. 34 Quiroz 6-1, 6-2 to tie the score at 2-2.
Next, No. 80 Johnson fell in a close match to UCLA’s No. 74 Dennis Mkrtchian 7-6, 6-4, allowing the Bruins to clinch the match when an energetic No. 116 Clay Thompson topped No. 93 Wang 7-6, 6-4.
All the while, No. 17 Sarmiento was locked in a battle on court one with a familiar foe in UCLA’s No. 25 Dennis Novikov. The match was suspended after Wang’s defeat with Sarmiento up a break in the third set at 6-4, 3-6, 4-2.
Though the loss — the third this season to their crosstown rivals — is frustrating, the Trojans refuse to dwell on it, constantly reminding themselves that an unprecedented fifth consecutive NCAA championship is their ultimate goal this season. The team will have the chance to make progress toward that goal next month, as it will likely host the first two rounds of the NCAA tournament at Marks Stadium on May 10 and 11.
USC head coach Peter Smith has repeatedly emphasized his willingness to lose if it means growing and having success in the NCAA tournament, a sentiment echoed by his players.
“It’s disappointing that we lost,” Wang said, “but I know we’ll come back stronger.”
Definitely missed Gomez in the singles which would have been the swing point. It is not the same w/o Steve
Johnson getting his automatic point in the singles competition plus Daniel Nyuen (sp.) clutch victories in the
big matches.

The USC women’s sand volleyball team’s No. 1 pair of junior Kirby Burnham and graduate student Stevi Robinson beat the USA junior beach national team duo of Courtney Trevino and USC alum Geena Urango on Saturday in a hotly contested match to win an exhibition tournament between the two teams.
Tune-up · Freshman Sydney Seau and junior Sam Hirschmann (above) were both participants in the exhibition tournament over the weekend, as the team now prepares for the national championship in Gulf Shores, Ala. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
 
It was the last home match of the season for the Women of Troy at the brand-new Merle Norman Stadium, where they went 7-3 this year.
“We’ve loved the home-court advantage this year,” USC head coach Anna Collier said. “Hopefully, this stadium will be the host of the national championship in years to come.”
The USA squad got some retribution in the third-place match, as USA’s Jane Chafeh and Heather Hughes defeated the No. 2 USC pair of senior Katie Fuller and freshman Cinnamon Sary in straight sets 21-19, 21-17.
And in a battle of USC teams, the No. 4 duo of sophomore Kati Duddridge and junior Brooke Fournier defeated USC sophomore Eve Ettinger and freshman Christine Irvin 21-18, 24-26, 15-11 to capture fifth place.
This exhibition match was the Women of Troy’s final tune-up before the team travels to the American Volleyball Coaches Association collegiate sand volleyball national championship next weekend in Gulf Shores, Ala.
“This was good for our team of more beach-style players, because pairs on the junior national team were similar to a North Florida or a Louisiana-Monroe team that we might meet that have that a scrappy, little beach game,” Collier said. “Now, hopefully, we won’t be caught off guard by these teams’ style of play.”
In the exhibition, the pairs of Burnham-Robinson, Chafeh-Hughes and Trevino-Urango each went 3-0 in order to advance to their respective matches. Urango, who played on USC’s indoor team from 2007-10, was the first scholarship recipient of the Women of Troy’s sand volleyball program in its 2012 debut season. She was part of USC’s No. 1 pairs team, which made it to the AVCA collegiate sand volleyball championship pairs quarterfinals.
Fuller and Sary, along with Duddridge and Fournier, both went 2-1 to finish second in their pools to advance to their final matches. Ettinger would do so as well, while mixing partners between Irvin and sophomore Bria Russ.
The winners of the exhibition tournament, Burnham and Robinson, will look to translate their winning play to next weekend, when they play in the 16-team pairs championship in Gulf Shores, Ala.
“Right now, we are primarily going in focusing on the team playing against North Florida in the opening match, so we will worry about ours when the time comes,” Robinson said.
The Women of Troy (14-6) will be the fourth-seeded team in the upcoming national championship that runs from May 3-5. USC will open up against North Florida on May 3 at 7 a.m, and the winner of that match will take on top-ranked and top-seeded Pepperdine at noon on the same day.

As I stand on the precipice of never writing another sports article, I can’t help but sense an important part of me slipping away, never to return again. It’s not that I’ve ever considered myself an actual sports journalist, more just an opinionated sports fan with patience for the writing process.
Now that a mass of missed calls from a 213 area code asking for my first donation to USC as an alumnus has gathered on my phone, it’s time to set aside trivialities and tackle adulthood head on. After all, I am no longer the 6-year-old who showed up to his tonsillectomy clad in a full Boston Celtics tracksuit. Perhaps the time has come to bury my No. 34 David Ortiz jersey deep in the closet and to let loose the awakening I felt upon walking through the Coliseum gate 26 tunnel for the first time to behold, quite literally, the light at the end that shined on a perfect inner world offset from reality.
But then I pause, because I realize the stakes, even while everyone around me can’t wrap their minds around why I take my sports fandom so seriously.
Upon charging full steam ahead into adult life, I don’t want to become a surly old man, devoid of childish wonderment and passion that defy logical explanation. I don’t want to become the reductive realist who dismisses sports as “just a game” or, more cynically, opium for the masses doled out by the elites to placate people who might otherwise grow restless with their disappointing lot in life. Being a sports fan is about so much more than vicarious living.
Despite witnessing, in many ways, the dark ages of USC football and basketball, I can’t overstate what sports fandom has done for me throughout my time at college, both concretely and less tangibly. It’s never just been about the bottom line of wins and losses and feeling happy or sad.
On Sept. 19, 2009, former quarterback Aaron Corp completed 13 of 22 passes for 110 yards and an interception, leading USC to its lowest point total in three years in a 16-13 loss at Washington and helping torpedo a season that once overflowed with expectations. That game changed the course of my college career as much as it changed Corp’s.
Earlier that Saturday, a girl who served with me on a student government board shot me a text out of nowhere. She asked if I could update her on the progress of the USC game because she was planning to go behind enemy lines that same day and watch UCLA play at the Rose Bowl with some of her former high school friends who had “Bruined” their lives. She wouldn’t have access to the live broadcast.
We didn’t have much of a rapport up until then, though I had always admired her kindness and felt overpowered by her glowing smile. She didn’t know it at the time, but I had developed a small crush on her.
Our brief conversations before had convinced her that I was someone who would faithfully watch the USC game on television and report back. A few text messages exchanged during the game, expressing our collective frustrations and wondering what the upset loss meant for 2009, later led to dates, which later evolved into a relationship. That Saturday, USC football, however depressing, provided the perfect excuse to strike up a conversation with this girl; it was a talking point and a start, and for that, I am grateful.
Certainly, fandom isn’t always that pretty and tidy. The nasty campus Porta Potties on game days quickly attest to that fact. And we’ve all witnessed the ugliness of fans who have had a few too many beverages, ad-libbing, “Hey! You suck (expletive)” to Gary Glitter’s indescribably catchy “Rock and Roll (The Hey Song)” and spouting other profanities tinged with homophobia and racism.
Fandom doesn’t always completely add up, either. After attending his first football game at the Coliseum, my Russian TA for an international relations survey course once asked me if I could imagine the USC Song Girls plopped outside the Kremlin, rhythmically squatting and thrusting their two fingers in the air, and the reactions they would get.
Despite the ridiculousness of it all, I have also witnessed the values prized by USC come to the fore when a collective group cheers as one, which is why I bristle at the argument that serious academics and serious sports don’t mesh. Together, Trojan fans applaud integrity, fortitude and a little bit of flippant disdain for corruption — values by which anyone is well-served.
As a transplanted New Englander, becoming a USC fan not only introduced me to a culture and tradition of which I was utterly ignorant, but also made this university home for me. In the face of mounting losses and external vitriol, we never lost confidence in our greatness, our ability to rise again or the privilege of our Trojan existence — a lesson that will benefit me every time I feel self-doubt.
Though my sports-writing career draws to an end, I will never forget how my experiences as a USC fan shaped the trajectory of my time in college and injected it with boundless meaning. No matter where I go from here, USC will never be too far behind.

The USC women’s lacrosse team closed out its inaugural season in stunning fashion, holding off San Diego State to earn a playoff berth with a 12-11 win on Saturday, April 27, at Aztec Lacrosse Field.

The Women of Troy (8-9, 5-3 MPSF), who were projected to finish seventh in the program’s first season, secured the fourth seed in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament with the win.
Freshman attack Caroline Cordrey and freshman midfield Amanda Johansen led USC, each earning four goals and an assist. Johansen also picked up four ground balls and two draw controls, while Cordrey had two ground balls and three draw controls. Freshman midfield Caroline de Lyra added two goals and an assist, while freshman midfield Haleigh Dalmass scored a pair of goals. Freshman goalie Liz Shaeffer picked up six saves.
“We’ve been working hard all year-round to get to this point,” Cordrey said. “Everyone on the team believed we could do it, and I think that definitely showed today. We came out here, we were confident, we didn’t play like first-years. Looking forward to the tournament, we will have to use this momentum to keep us going and play games with this kind of intensity.”
San Diego State (8-8, 3-5 MPSF) was led by Sophie Koubek, who picked up three goals and four draw controls. Attackers Bailey Ewing and Michaela Jarvis each scored a pair of goals for the Aztecs.
Johansen started off quickly, scoring the first goal just 1:16 into the game. Jarvis responded quickly, tying the game up about a half minute later. Goals from De Lyra and Johansen gave USC a 3-1 lead, but a pair of goals from Koubek tied it back up. After USC jumped out to a 5-4 lead, the Aztecs scored three consecutive goals to lead 7-5, their largest lead of the game. Cordrey would score three unanswered goals to end the half, giving the Women of Troy an 8-7 lead at halftime.
USC outshot San Diego State        15-12 in the first half. The Aztecs had 11 fouls and seven turnovers in the half, compared to only four fouls and five turnovers for USC. Both teams earned six ground balls, while San Diego State beat USC in draw controls, 9-7.
Both teams alternated goals throughout the second half, with San Diego State not letting USC build up a lead of more than two goals. USC was able to hold off the Aztecs for the last seven minutes of the contest to preserve the win and secure the final playoff spot.
The final statistics reflected the evenness of the game, with USC out-shooting San Diego State             23-22 and earning 13 draw controls compared to San Diego State’s 12. The Women of Troy also committed 12 turnovers to the Aztecs’ 10, and both teams picked up 11 ground balls.
“It was a really close game the whole way through,” USC head coach Lindsey Munday said. “I’m really proud of the girls with how they played together for a full 60 minutes. They had each other’s back, and the reason we were able to do that was how we compete in practice every day. This win really is all 25 players battling every single day in practice, and it showed on the field.”
The Women of Troy will compete in the MPSF semi-finals against No. 1 seed Denver (16-1, 8-0 MPSF) in Eugene, Or., on Thursday at 4:30 p.m. A win against Denver would put them in the MPSF championship game against either Stanford (11-5, 6-2 MPSF) or California (9-6, 6-2 MPSF) on Saturday, May 4, at 1 p.m.
“This was our goal from the beginning,” said freshman defense Kelsey Dreyer. “We put all of our hard work [in] from the first day of September to the first day of the regular season. It all just culminated into this big win tonight, and it’s just going to propel us into success.”

Goodbye. It is a word that is often used to express that the end of a special friendship or era is near (for example, a pending graduation from USC).
However, at times the word can feel just as pertinent when applied to television. Sometimes, all it takes is one episode to make a viewer become entranced with a show. These fans then follow that show relentlessly — watching it as it ascends to emotional heights, but also sticking with it (like a dedicated USC basketball fan) when the program suddenly plummets to terrible lows.
What happens when a show has spiraled so far down that fans acknowledge that it has lost the essence of what made it great? Do consumers feel they have a moral obligation to continue watching a show, simply because they have invested so much time and concentration in it?
Sometimes, producers try to breath new life into shows that clearly need to go off the air.On Thursday, the CW aired The Original, a show based on the vampires from The Vampire Diaries who started the whole vampire race. Despite how lame and outrageous The Vampire Diaries has become, the CW clearly still thinks they can suck some more money out of the franchise by creating a spin-off series.
This is not an uncommon phenomenon. For example, Gossip Girl is one unavoidable case study.
The first few seasons feel fresh and juicy because the characters are catty and unpredictable, and the high school premise, which is admittedly a little outrageous, whisks viewers into the upper Manhattan world of champagne, glamorous penthouse apartments and perfect-looking people.
But then the show takes a more unbelievable, radical direction. The students graduate from their wild high school, get their own apartments and find jobs (surprisingly easily, actually, considering the job market at the time). Identities are stolen, they go off to “college” and Blair gets engaged to a prince.
An overly drawn out plot is not the only way a show can also outlast its expiration date, though. Shows can also get old fast when its stars depart.
This couldn’t be more true for The Office. Now on its ninth season, the show has lost some of its most-beloved cast members, such as Steve Carell, Mindy Kaling and B.J. Novak. Though new characters have come in to fill their shoes, they do not connect with the storylines in the same way that earlier characters did. This distance might be because viewers didn’t get to watch them evolve season to season.
Surprisingly though, despite this, the fan base remains loyal to the show.
Similarly, earlier this year, network executives behind Community fired the show’s creator after a change in network management. Community has one of the most passionate fan bases in recent memory, but after the unexpected firing, fans were left with the dilemma of whether to keep watching or ditch the show, according to Albert Ching of The Atlantic.
Ching said that although continuing to watch endorsed the disappointing firing of the show’s initial creator, not watching “would mean abandoning the characters and storylines that fans adore.”
The fourth season opened with a slight increase from the season-three premiere, however, showing that audiences are still willing to watch despite a new showrunner.
Obviously, there is something special that makes people continue to tune in, despite their feelings toward the creative direction a once-beloved show has taken. But the question remains: Why? How is it possible that people continue to watch shows that have gone bad even while admitting the decline that these programs have taken?
It seems the most plausible answer to this phenomenon comes not from an obligation, but a feeling of dependence.
Audiences attach to the characters, the stories and the reliability of a weekly television show. Blair can marry a prince. Carell can leave The Office. Yet vampires can have a dramatic historical spin-off series. And fans will keep watching because, at a certain point, a TV show is like a reliable, handy and entertaining companion. Every week, devoted watchers can go home, throw on their pajamas, grab dinner and sit in front of the TV to watch an hourlong episode.
When the show is on one of those annoying summer breaks, despite viewers’ gripes about the show, they still miss it. It’s like when a friend goes away. You still feel their absence — no matter how annoying he or she might be — when they leave town for awhile.
This analogy might be truer than you think. More and more it seems people are  describing their relationships with a TV show like a romantic relationship. TV, after all, is enjoyed week after week unlike other forms of media, such as movies and video games, that are often one-hit wonders.
If you think about it, people devote a portion of each week to watching shows, they enjoy catching up with them in the comfort of their own homes and they miss their favorite shows when they go on hiatus.
Essentially, similar to a positive romantic relationship, TV shows provide reliability and comfort. After a long day, something trustworthy will be waiting at home.
In fact, a show may be even more dependable than a person. When The Office says it will meet you on Thursday at 9 p.m., it will be there. It doesn’t matter that the cast has changed and the story lines are faulty. Despite this, there is some comfort in knowing that when camped out, sad, distressed and stressed from daily life, The Office will still be waiting.
But, though it’s hard to bid farewell to a show that has been watched by many devoted fans since day one, every show must run its course. Every reign must come to an end, which means that viewers perhaps need to take it upon themselves to decide when that is (because sometimes the networks and producers are too invested in the show’s profits to nip the fragmented relationship in the bud).
Saying goodbye to over-done shows where the main stars are barely in it only makes room for new and better, fresh-faced shows.
So goodbye, Glee. Goodbye, The Vampire Diaries. And goodbye to the train-wreck that is the Secret Life of the American Teenager. It’s been a long run. It’s been great — thrilling, really — to let you into my life.
But it’s time to face the facts: We’re just at very different points in our lives right now, and it’s time for me at least to finally tune out.

The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines knavery as a “roguish or mischievous act.” Whether discussing the antics of frat brethren on The Row or the characters in an Errol Flynn movie, this is a fun word to throw around.

But A Noise Within’s new production of George Farquhar’s The Beaux’ Stratagem, truly seems to embody this word.
Set in a small town in rural England in the early 18th century, the story revolves around two young men seeking to hoodwink a wealthy woman into marriage and split her fortune. Between the feisty female characters and the obsession with marrying into wealth, consider this a sort of topsy-turvy take on Pride and Prejudice, but with a lot more laughs.
And though it might take audience members a moment to adjust to the various English accents of the actors, the speed with which they deliver their lines and the old-school language they use, one needn’t be an English scholar to enjoy the madness that unfurls.
Upon entering the theater, the beauty of the set immediately serves as a sign of good things to come. The thrust stage holds huge arrangements of rich red and brown wood, creating the inside of a standard English countryside pub and inn. The set is so carefully crafted, however, that the pub almost looks too nice -— as though maybe if you stepped inside yourself, if wouldn’t smell quite as bad as it should. The next set arrangement takes viewers inside the home of Lady Bountiful, a loony old widow who concocts “alternative remedies” and aims to cure townspeople of their various ailments. Bountiful’s home is filled with extravagant furniture, much of it upholstered in velvet or boasting clawed wooden feet — think lavish Versailles. Fans of Antiques Roadshow will surely drool over this production.
The splendor of the set is mirrored in the amazing costumes worn by the actors. When Aimwell, the con artist/suitor, first arrives in town desperate to prove his high status, he wears a stunning gray — silk suit with intricate embroidery and a gaudy Three Musketeers-style hat. The way this fabric catches the stage lights might inspire gasps from the audience.
The zany black and white ball gowns worn by Lady Bountiful are just as impressive, creating a look akin to the most glamorous of Tim Burton characters. The gowns worn by Mrs. Sullen and Dorinda are gorgeous as well, adding a splendid color pop to the wooden set with their rich jewel tones.
But looking beyond appearances, Farquhar’s story is treated to a wonderful adaptation by Thornton Wilder, renowned for his outstanding plays Our Town and The Skin of Our Teeth, and Ken Ludwig. Wilder and Ludgwig’s interpretation of Beaux’ maintains the humor of Farquhar’s original plot but updates the language with the sharpness that earned Wilder his two Pulitzer Prizes for drama.
Lines that contain shrewd insight into the human condition are dead giveaways of Wilder’s hand, along with the biting humor evident in lines such as, “The man is a walking Babylon” or “His father was hanged for miscounting spoons.”
The uniquely brilliant character traits, however, are all thanks to Farquhar. The character of Sullen, for example, could be described simply as such: unhappily married, loves to get drunk and throws chairs through windows.
These magnificent characters are paid their due respect by a cast of immensely talented actors. Blake Ellis plays Francis Archer, the devious but charming knave eagerly after some bride’s fortune. Ellis makes several self-aware monologues directly to the audience and absolutely nails the comedic edge necessary for lines such as, “If this were a play, we’d be nearing the climax.” Ellis’ zeal in all of Archer’s endeavors makes him incredibly fun to watch. Keep an eye out for this guy, because he is a rising star.
Another standout performance comes from Deborah Strang, who plays Lady Bountiful and can also be seen in brilliant form in another show in the repertory, The Grapes of Wrath. Clearly, Strang has quite the dramatic range, and her fearless commitment to the insanity of Lady Bountiful is commendable.
The show is stolen by Time Winters in his brief role as Foigard, the obnoxious French minister who is manipulated by the beaux. Winters’ French accent is downright outrageous — it’s hard to tell if it’s the best French accent ever or the very worst. But either way, expect to cry tears of laughter because of it.
As cliche as it might sound, this production has something for everyone. Love a good choreographed fight sequence? Check. Enjoy a nice bromance? Boom. Always wanted to see two women take up arms? Look no further. Nothing about The Beaux’ Stratagem feels old, and the fresh revival promises to win many new fans.

Movies love to declare themselves as “based on a true story.” The phrase automatically infuses an extra shot of legitimacy to the story, despite wild deviations from any real tale.
$$$ · Paul Doyle, played by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, runs through the streets of Miami after getting involved in with a notorious gang. – Courtesy of Jaimie Trueblood
 
Pain & Gain, infamous director Michael Bay’s new film, goes to great lengths to ensure its viewers know it is based on actual events, including stopping halfway through to flash text on the screen reminding us of this fact.
This is a good thing, as the twists and turns that the story takes are so ridiculous that, if it wasn’t for the reminder that this all actually happened, people would probably walk out shaking their heads, laughing at the scriptwriter. Instead, Pain & Gain becomes a fascinating and hilarious ode to ambition and stupidity.
The film shows the downward spiral of the “Sun Gym Gang,” the perpetrators of a series of kidnappings, murders and extortions in Miami during the early ’90s.
A ballooning Mark Wahlberg plays Danny Lugo, a personal trainer and bodybuilder who gets a gang together to kidnap a Miami millionaire and force him to sign over all his assets.
Dwayne Johnson, looking even more mountainous than usual, plays Lugo’s dense, recovering-alcoholic, born-again Christian friend and, frankly, steals the movie with his unhinged, deadpan delivery and charm. Together, with an equally muscular Anthony Mackie, they pull off the plan but handle any and all complications with the finesse of a rhinoceros.
Bay takes a break from filming exploding alien robots to direct all of this and surprisingly, does very well. Bay does not garner much respect from movie critics who don’t find much subtlety in his directorial style, but this character-driven plot, though as far from subtle as a film can get, might actually be the perfect movie for him.
Again, subtlety is almost nowhere to be found, but that does not sink Pain & Gain. The main characters are all over-the-top, steroid-popping criminals. They talk loudly and obsess over sex, drugs and their next set in the gym.
The jokes, too, are crass, and they keep coming — not only from the lead characters but also from a laundry list of current comedy stars (Ken Jeong, Rebel Wilson, Rob Corddry) in supporting roles. The humor in the film is really no different really from the jokes Bay usually employs in his scripts, except that in this case they work beautifully. Subtlety would have been a mistake.
The film plays out like Scarface on steroids, both literally and figuratively, with the power-hungry Lugo driving himself to the top by any means necessary, then suffering under the strain of all he has done and the consequences of his highly impulsive decisions. Bay does not attempt to hide this parallel, even having Wahlberg imitate an accent similar to Al Pacino’s infamous “Cuban” accent for one scene. Then of course, there’s the Miami setting and piles of cocaine.
However, there is a marked difference to making a hero out of a fictional Tony Montana than making one out of a man currently on death row for the crimes shown in this movie. The emphasis on this being a true story seems to cement this.
The question now is: Is that difference good or bad? The audience is seemingly directed to root for a man and actions that actually caused a lot of pain in people’s lives.
Though Scarface had its basis in the crime world that existed in Miami and South America, and the drug industry it glorified negatively affected thousands of lives, it can protect itself behind the shield of “fiction.” There are no victims of Tony Montana walking around Miami.
There are, however, people walking around who have been personally victimized by Lugo’s excessive violence and recklessness. Therefore, creating a movie that gets him played by a big Hollywood star such as Wahlberg seems to come with questions about the ethics of glamorizing real-world criminal behavior.
Then again, the fact that this was a true story gives Pain & Gain more punch than Scarface ever could making the whole ordeal worthwhile viewing. It tells us that someone saw Scarface and loved it. Then it tells us that, unlike the overwhelming majority of people who have watched it, this person didn’t stop at making impressions of Tony’s accent but decided he wanted to be Tony.
On top of this, the story tells us this person actually managed to claw his way through crime and dumb luck to the top and was victim to the accompanying fall. This all actually happened.
Bay takes this unbelievable story, takes the over-the-top tone and simple dialogue that seems so out of place in the mouths of government agents in the Transformers movies and sticks them in a setting where they actually seem essential — a bodybuilders’ gang of high school dropouts. And by using the same tools that previously brought him ridicule, Bay delivers, crafting a hilarious movie filled with great performances that shouldn’t be missed. As hard as it might be for Bay-haters to believe, this is a true story.
This was one of the greatest movies I’ve ever seen.  Don’t know what this Mark guy is talking about.
That movie totally sucked…walked out on it.  It was bad.  Anyone says differently….something is wrong with them…or they’re demented.

After the Boston Marathon bombings, many Americans displayed idiocy in two distinct ways. First, some Twitter users started blaming the Czech Republic for the attacks, prompting Czech ambassadors to go to the Associated Press to clarify the difference between their Central European country and the Russian region known as Chechnya, where the suspects had come from.
But second, and far worse, Republicans began to link the attacks to lax immigration laws, leading conservative lawmakers on the Hill to say that they will attempt to further restrict the immigration process.
That move by some Republicans shows exactly how out of touch they are with the problems facing this country.
Both Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who are ethnic Chechens from Dagestan and are widely believed to be behind the bombing, legally resided in this country. Dzhokhar, who is in custody, is an American citizen. According to the Washington Post, Sen. Rand Paul wrote in an open letter that Chechnya is “an area known as the hotbed of Islamic extremism,” as if that alone should bar immigrants from that region.
The argument that Paul is making is Islamophobic and racist. Paul is equating Islam with terror, when the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful people. Furthermore, the mere fact that the brothers were part of an ethnic group that is fighting against Russia should not disqualify them from citizenship. The Tsarnaevs did not choose to be born Chechen. Here, Paul appears to discriminate against hardworking people simply because of their ethnic heritage.
Unfortunately, other Republicans are beginning to follow Paul’s lead. Sen. Charles Grassley, proposed tougher checks on anyone wanting to enter the United States, according to the New York Times.
Grassley and other lawmakers should understand that wanting to come to this nation should not be probable cause to have American police forces examine every part of a person’s life.
Politicians are right to want to stop terror attacks on American soil. Every lawmaker should concentrate on keeping the American people safe. However, immigration is a red herring with regard to national security. The U.S. has some of the best police forces in the world and should concentrate on using legal investigative techniques to look for clues that alert law enforcement to a potential threat. Targeting people because of their ethnicity, religion or desire to move this country is unconstitutional and unethical at best.
If Republicans want to deal with the root causes of animosity toward the United States, then they would do better to help improve America’s image in the Muslim world.
The wars in the Middle East and the blatant Islamophobia from congressional leaders causes terrorist groups like al-Qaeda to legitimately be able to say that America oppresses Muslims. Every time a hegemonic state such as the U.S. imposes its will through force on a group, that group turns against the oppressors, and according to counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism expert David Kilcullen, that is one of the fundamental flaws with American counter-terror and counterinsurgency efforts.
Republican legislators who are in positions of power think of the country as the proverbial city on the hill while simultaneously bashing Islam and numerous other minority groups. It is no wonder extremists are willing to kill Americans.
As for immigration reform, Republicans should approve paths to citizenship, allow increased legal immigration and ease entry restrictions into this country. In a time of economic hardship, Keynesians rightly argue that a reinvigorated workforce and the resulting flow of capital will help pull the American economy out of the gutter. Furthermore, an influx of new people living in this country will require additional housing, and President Barack Obama has already acknowledged with his proposed budget numbers that housing is going to be one of the biggest areas for American economic growth in the coming years. In that way, allowing more immigrants is nothing but a benefit for this country.
Some Americans on Twitter confused Chechnya and the Czech Republic. Meanwhile, a few republican lawmakers proved to be the real problem with their impossible antics in Congress.

“Targeting people because of their ethnicity, religion or desire to move this country is unconstitutional and unethical at best.”
Sheesh, can you believe this stuff.
It’s not unethical it’s common sense.  Muslims across the globe, and every single day, resort to terrorism in the name of Allah.  In the past 6 days there have been 34 separate suicide Muslim terrorist attacks.  This is a fact.  These people are “unethical” not the law enforcement officials who have to use common sense to protect us from these Muslim terrorists.
And, finally, what is most disturbing about your article is your complete lack of empathy for all the people whose lives have been destroyed by these Muslim terrorists.  Be it those who lost legs, had ball bearings pierce their brains, nails rip through their faces, or their relatives, friends and lovers it is obvious you are more concerned with the terrorists who detonated the bombs than with the victims.
I’d suggest you volunteer in a hospital for those who are brain dead, or need to learn how to walk with a prosthetic leg to learn who were the real victims in this ongoing saga.
The suspect is an American citizen and by the letter of the law he should have his Miranda rights read and should be tried in a court of law and convicted by a jury of his peers. The suspect was not born in the United States right? He is not a real American or an American born citizen right? I have a question for the immigration department or anybody that wants to respond. Why does the United States allow and give people access to immigrate to the United States legally knowing there from Mid-Eastern countries that have a strong Al Qaida presence but we do not allow or give access to legal immigration from individuals from Mexico ? Which is why most Mexican people risk their lives coming into this country illegally because if they were given the same immigration opportunities the Mid-Eastern people get then they would not com e into our country illegally? 99 percent of Mid-Eastern people are great people it’s the one percent of the people that want to destroy America. I know that some Mexicans come to our country to have kids and live off the government but most come to work jobs Americans don’t want or are too lazy to work. I served eight years in the US Army and two combat tours so I have met Al Qaida and other Muslim terrorist on the battle field. My point is that the United States does not allow or provide legal immigration access to Mexicans who come to this country to work jobs Americans don’t want like picking fruit in the California fields but the United States allows and provides legal immigration access to people that come from the Mid-East and who com e to bomb and kill Americans like in Boston or the guys that flu the two planes into the World Trade Center. What’s wrong with American when Fox News and CNN are blaming Mexican illegal’s for all the problems in America but not questioning why so many people from the Mid East get papers to legally live in the US so then they can become US citizens and commit a terrorist act on American soil against Americans. I love America and I’m proud of being an American, I have earned my freedom on the battlefield fighting against our enemies that now allowed to immigrate to our country. GO ARMY BEAT NAVY!!!
“The argument that Paul is making is Islamophobic and racist.”
You cannot be serious.
First, Islam is not a “race” it is a religion.  It is a very diverse religion racially because of its history of vioent Jihad.  Specifically when it conquered North Africa in the 8th century it forced millions of black women both into slavery and as whore for Muslim men.  Islam did the same thing with the Hindus and Buddhists of South Asia, the “whiter” people of the Caucus region, etc….
Secondly Islamophobic is a made-up word used to convince people that Islam is a religion of peace, that Jihad is an inner struggle, that Quranic verses about Islamic supremacy are not what they seem to be, etc…
Fear of Muslims is not a phobia it is an intelligent observation based on real actions carried out by devout Muslims in the name of Allah.
Get your facts straight.
^rude
Typical Dan, going from “some Americans” to just “Republicans” in general because he can cite a few Republicans who have done so
You realize when you make yourself look bigoted no one can take your opinion seriously, right?

Gentrification hurts. Nobody knows this better than Mercedes Cortes, a Guatemalan immigrant who settled in Hollywood in the 1960s with her husband and three sons.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
 
According to an L.A. Weekly profile, Cortes’ apartment on Eleanor Avenue near the intersection of Santa Monica Boulevard and Vine Street was threatened by rampant violence in the 1980s, so she, along with several of her neighbors, formed and enforced a strict neighborhood watch program that worked successfully to ensure that their neighborhood could be called safe.
Cortes’ efforts were lauded, and she and her neighbors were proud that their efforts to improve their neighborhood were remarkable enough to help prompt a revitalization of Hollywood. But what Cortes didn’t realize was that her work to help save her neighborhood from gangs and crime would ultimately be a part of the reason she had to move away.
In 2004, Cortes was asked to leave her neighborhood of 30 years — the one she and others had worked so hard to ensure was a livable, thriving community. The reason? Simply put, Cortes could not pay her rent.
Hollywood has been widely labeled as a “neighborhood on the rise” for the past decade or so. The policies of 13th District Councilman Eric Garcetti have done well to ensure that Hollywood, as well as other neighborhoods such as Silver Lake, East Hollywood and Echo Park, are part of an end goal of “urban renewal.”
That goal often involves public projects aimed at attracting higher-income individuals to the area, including the redevelopment or destruction of older housing, which is detrimental to low-income individuals living in these urban-renewal areas. For example, expensive projects such as Hollywood Lofts and Jefferson at Hollywood now exist on space that was, less than a decade ago, home to high-density, low-income apartment buildings.
But Hollywood’s gentrification affects more than just those who live in buildings slated for destruction.
Between 2000 and 2010 — the years of the last two U.S. census counts — Hollywood and East Hollywood witnessed a population decrease of 12,878 people. Of these people, approximately 11,000 are identified as low-income Latinos.
Larry Gross, the executive director of the Coalition for Economic Survival, a tenants’ rights advocacy group, informed L.A. Weekly how the census data in Hollywood reflects “an economic tsunami that pushed low-income people out. There was massive displacement.”
This trend is occurring in other parts of the city as well. Take, for example, census tract 1974.20. Bordered by Glendale and Sunset boulevards to the west and south and Avalon Street and Echo Park Avenue to the north and east, 1974.20 is an Echo Park census tract that did not change boundaries between 2000 and 2010.
Over the course of the last decade, tract 1974.20 witnessed an increase of just 200 white residents. The same tract in Echo Park witnessed an exodus of about 1,000 Latino individuals in the same amount of time.
This is the true story of gentrification, one that those who move into gentrified neighborhoods most often don’t hear.
Gentrification drives up the cost of living in areas of the city that were previously more affordable for low-income individuals. For Cortes, most of her time living on Eleanor Avenue was done so at a rent that she could afford.
But as Hollywood became marked for urban revitalization, and the area surrounding her apartment building was redeveloped into residences that attracted higher-income individuals, the rent in her building went up too. Her manager understood that the area was now prime real estate for people who could afford to pay more than Cortes. With this in mind, it made logical business sense to increase the rent to a level comparable to what new people moving into the area would be able to pay.
Though it’s likely that forcing out low-income individuals is not an end goal, the desire to attract people with higher incomes automatically means that individuals who cannot afford the high rents are pushed out.
I don’t believe this is a desirable result. Urban renewal implies genuinely changing an area for the better and not simply replacing poor Latinos with coffee shops. One can hope that future developments in the city are done more responsibly, but the very nature of gentrification implies they won’t be.
