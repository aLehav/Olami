On a gloomy afternoon at Howard Jones Field, the Trojans enjoyed a slightly relaxed practice after a heavy contact Tuesday of play. With the first road game of the season only days away, head coach Clay Helton emphasized third-down efficiency throughout Wednesday’s practice. 
“Be perfect,” Helton shouted as his receivers practiced one-on-one drills. “This is the key right here.”
The rivalry has evolved since Helton arrived at USC, becoming one of the fiercest and earliest tests of each season for the team. Ahead of this year’s game, Helton reminisced on the classic battles he’s witnessed before — the triple-overtime loss, Andre Heidari’s 53-yard field goal, Andrew Luck’s last minute march down the field. After the pair faced off twice last season, he says that the rivalry has only grown stronger.
“It has always been a close game,” Helton said. “It’s been some of my favorite memories and some of my favorite heart breaks. It just always seems like an extremely physical contest. Both teams take a lot of pride into this game.”
Helton adjusts for Stanford attack
The defense shone as the first team closed out practice with a two-minute drill. Linebackers junior Jordan Iosefa and senior Porter Gustin forced freshman quarterback JT Daniels to backpedal into a sack to force a third-down situation, and cornerback Greg Johnson snagged a pick to close out practice. The sideline roared as the redshirt freshman crashed onto his back, celebrating the play, as Helton looked on with a grin.
Against a team like Stanford, consistent defensive pressure will be key to grind down major offensive threats such as running back Bryce Love and quarterback K.J. Costello. Team captain Cam Smith emphasized the importance of creating long third down situations to force Stanford to push through every snap.
“They’re more multidimensional than they have been,” Smith said. “They like to get the ball to the perimeter with their big guys. We always do a really good job of preparing against these guys. This game always means something more to us.”
Love, who enters the season as the clear favorite for the Heisman, will be the first priority for the defense to shut down. But after flourishing last season as a sophomore, Costello also provides an arsenal of skill in the air, creating a dual threat for the defense to address. The secondary dedicated a solid period of practice to drills guarding corner routes, which Costello typically bombs 25 or 35 yards deep. 
Stanford also boasts a muscly offensive line, and Helton emphasized that the interior of the defensive line will be put to the test to apply pressure on Costello and plug Love at the line. Players who weigh over 300 pounds, such as Brandon Pili, will be key in balancing out the battle in the trenches.
Injury report
Tight end Josh Falo provided a bright spot on the sidelines for the Trojans on Wednesday, staying out of pads but practicing non-contact drills on his own as he continues rehabilitating a hamstring injury. Falo looked comfortable running sprints and practicing cuts in the open field, and Helton feels optimistic that he will be back to full speed soon. Center Toa Lobendahn also continues to look strong after returning to practice on Tuesday. 
After struggling to finish practice on Tuesday, defensive tackle Brandon Pili stuck to the sidelines with a wrist injury. His wrist remains tightly taped, but Helton said he expects the sophomore to play on Saturday against Stanford.
Greg Johnson returned after sitting out with a 24-hour bug yesterday, but Isaiah Pola-Mao sat out with the same illness. Safety Bubba Bolden remains out of contention with an unaddressed suspension, and Helton had no comment on the sophomore’s status during Wednesday’s practice.

If you didn’t watch basketball on Tuesday night, you missed an iconic moment in the history of the sport.
Some games are easy to predict as instant classics, and a Game 5 conference championship final pitting some of the finest players in the game definitely fits into that category. But it was hard to predict that the outcome of the Storm vs. Mercury matchup would become quite as historic as it did.
The source of the game’s intensity came from Sue Bird, the oldest player in the league, who secured a comeback, a spot in the Finals and her legacy in the sport of basketball with a 14-point fourth quarter that dazzled players across the men’s and women’s leagues.
The beauty of the moment was cultivated by the purely literary qualities of the game. At its best, sport feels like a spectacle, like a miraculous story unfolding with all the drama of a movie or book. Announcers love to cry, “You couldn’t write a script like this…” as they marvel at a spectacular finish or feat.
This is, perhaps, the most tired cliche that exists in sport, and yet it’s true. Sports fans love sports for the story, for the drama. We love to bite our nails and get lost in the rush of thrill and anger and excitement that comes from every close game and upset.
Sure, we watch games out of dogged loyalty to our teams and unflagging commitment to our fantasy teams. But at its core, the love of sport comes from our fascination with the daily drama of the story unfolding between the lines of the field or court. And boy, did Tuesday night write one hell of a story.
The most beautiful part of watching the WNBA flourish has been the growth and deepening of storylines throughout the league. What Tuesday night’s game provided was a perfect intermingling of some of the best drama the WNBA has to offer.
The game boasted one of the league’s best rivalries — Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi, two of the most senior professionals in the league. They were teammates and champions at UConn, gold medalists on the U.S. Olympic team and best friends off the court. On the court, they’ve become fearsome rivals, and they clashed to force a winner-take-all Game 5.
These games were Taurasi’s speciality, a situation she had entered 13 times before and always emerged from with a victory. But Sue Bird is Sue Bird, one of the greatest of all time, and everyone watching knew she would bring a fight.
Of course, that isn’t enough of a storyline on its own. You have to add in two of the best centers to ever play the game — Breanna Stewart and Brittney Griner — at the height of their skill, battling to almost double-double finishes in the paint. And of course, you have to give the champion a handicap to create a true David and Goliath scene.
Because 14 points in one quarter might have been plenty. It would’ve been enough to dominate headlines, to force fans to turn on the TV for the final minutes, to send athletes across the country to Twitter to shout out Bird for her accomplishment. But maybe it wasn’t.
So of course, there was the mask.
If it wasn’t for the mask, there would’ve been no way to tell that Bird broke her nose fewer than 48 hours before the tip off. It wasn’t a first — Bird has broken her nose five times now over her expansive career as a point guard — and she shrugged off questions about the injury heading into the game.
And yet, there was something about the mask that made the scene that much more triumphant. As she launched back-to-back 3-pointers, as she dove for loose balls, as she hollered at referees and egged on her teammates, Bird’s injury highlighted the strength and grit that only the highest caliber of athletes can achieve.
So many times, when we talk about female athletes, we talk about them as a source of inspiration — they give strength to those who didn’t have it, to little girls watching them, to the dreams of other women who have been told they can’t measure up.
But Tuesday night shouldn’t be relegated this way. Bird wasn’t just an inspiration to little girls or female athletes. She was an inspiration. Period. Full stop. She played ball at a level that few can, and she played it with all of the skill and force that makes basketball such a fun sport to watch.
This, of course, is a source of hope for the future of the league — a game that transcends any gender barrier by producing athleticism so high in caliber that anyone can enjoy it, despite their bias or bigotry. But for now, let’s love it simply as a game, a game that reached the highest level the sport can offer, a game highlighting one of the best players to stand on a court.
Sue Bird, welcome to the club. You’re officially the G.O.A.T.

Marko Vavic, the son of head coach Jovan Vavic, was the team’s top scorer last season. (Tucker Judkins | Daily Trojan)
After starting the season with two wins last weekend at the UCLA Mini Invitational, the Men of Troy will be in the pool once again this weekend as they partake in the Inland Empire Invitational at the University of Redlands.
This past weekend, the Trojans showed once again why they were one win away from a national championship in 2017. Facing off against No. 18 Pomona-Pitzer and Whittier, the Men of Troy dominated with scores of 16-1 and 25-4, respectively. While all wins feel good, a strong season opening victory such as that over a ranked team in Pomona-Pitzer will give the Trojans plenty of positive momentum heading into the rest of their schedule.
Leading the way for USC, junior driver Marin Dasic and sophomore driver Marko Vavic put up 6 and 4 scores respectively over a successful weekend in Westwood. Anticipated to be the squad’s leading scorers in 2018, it was an impressive showing for the pair.
Aside from the well-known stars, a fair number of newcomers made their impact felt on Saturday. Freshman two-meter specialists Jake Ehrhardt and James Kolenda, and freshman utility Alexander Lansill were just three of the six new Trojans who scored to help seal victory in Saturday’s contests. 
In net, four different Trojans saw time in goal through the two contests. To the surprise of few, however, highly touted freshman goalie Sam Krutonog got the first crack at being USC’s goaltender when he started against Pomona-Pitzer and made eight saves in the winning effort.
Prior to the Invitational, USC will host Concordia in its home opener Thursday night, also one of the squads that USC will end up facing at this weekend’s invitational. The Trojans dismantled the Irvine-based team to the tune of a 25-3 win last season. Play begins at 5 p.m. at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
Looking ahead at this weekend’s slate of games, there is all the reason in the world for the Trojans to be confident that they will dominate as they did a year ago. In 2017, USC swept the competition with comfortable wins over Claremont-Mudd-Scripps and Redlands. Scoring 10 goals over the weekend, Dasic and Vavic scored prolifically and at will in last season’s competition.
This year, the story is expected to be largely similar. The one wrinkle is the addition of the La Verne Leopards to the weekend schedule. Coming off an 0-4 start to the 2018 season, the team will take on Riverside Community College, No. 7  Long Beach State and No. 10 UC Santa Barbara before facing off against the Men of Troy.
Overall, the competition USC will face at this weekend’s tournament has found tough sledding so far in 2018. Carrying a 3-9 total record (Claremont-Mudd-Scripps will debut at the invitational), the Trojans are expected to take care of business in Redlands, Calif. over the weekend.
The competition kicks off Saturday at 10:20 a.m. when the Trojans face off against the host team Redlands, and will continue through their last game at noon on Sunday against La Verne.

Freshman wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown had seven receptions for 98 yards and a touchdown against UNLV. (Catherine Liang | Daily Trojan)
Coming off a strong 43-21 season opening victory against UNLV, No. 17 USC now turns its attention to Saturday’s matchup with Bay Area rival No. 10 Stanford.
USC had a lot of positives to take away from its first victory. Freshman quarterback JT Daniels looked poised and played a smart game as the first true freshman to start on opening day for the Trojans since Matt Barkley in 2009. Freshman receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown showed why he was one of the top-rated players at his position and that his chemistry with Daniels is still strong from high school when they both attended Mater Dei. He led the Trojans with seven receptions for 98 yards and one touchdown. Senior running back Aca’Cedric Ware had a breakout game after three years of not being a featured back, rushing for 100 yards and a touchdown on just 10 carries. Along with sophomore running back Stephen Carr, who had nine carries for 54 yards and a 73 yard kickoff return, the Trojans’ new dynamic duo looked like it is ready to replace the loss of Ronald Jones II, who now plays for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
Against Stanford, however, USC is looking to deliver a much better performance. Head coach Clay Helton is very aware of what Stanford is capable of. 
“I have a lot of respect for both their players and their coaching staff, having competed against them for the last nine years,” Helton said. “It’s always been a great game, … a close game [and] a physical battle.” 
Last year, USC defeated Stanford twice at home, once in the third week of regular season play and again in the Pac-12 title game. However, star senior and Heisman Trophy candidate running back Bryce Love was unstoppable, rushing for a combined 285 yards and two touchdowns despite USC’s defense being focused on containing him. According to Helton, USC cannot just focus on the ground game this time around.
“Offensively, obviously, one of the better rushing attacks there’s been in our conference over the last nine years, bringing in a premier rusher as we all know in Bryce Love,”  Helton said. “Seeing them last week, against San Diego State, with a loaded box, they had to resort to the passing game. I think that’s kind of been the biggest change for them over the last year, is the advancement of [junior quarterback] KJ Costello, what [head coach David Shaw] has done with him and how he has progressed has been impressive.”
Oftentimes an afterthought to Love, Costello had one of his finest games for Stanford, passing for 332 yards and four scores to one interception. He almost exclusively targeted senior wideout JJ Arcega-Whiteside, who had a monster 226 yards and three touchdowns. Though USC will still be focused on Love, Costello and Arcega-Whiteside give Stanford three elite players that will keep the Trojans guessing.
Daniels’ first trip to The Farm
When asked what his expectations were of his first road game, especially such a high-profile one, Daniels downplayed any nerves.
“Don’t have any,” Daniels said. “I’m really just focused right now on getting to know their defense and understanding what we need to bring.” 
Daniels also acknowledged that the Trojans are still growing as a team and that they hope to be much better than they were last weekend.
“Nobody’s mad. We won the game,” Daniels said. “We just know it’s gonna take some time and some extra reps … The more you play, the more comfortable you get at a faster rate. My first couple snaps, I had zero college snaps; by the fourth quarter, I had 30 or so.”
On the transition from the high school game to college, Daniels pointed out two key factors.
“Size and speed [are] obviously something that’s different when you’re going from high schoolers to college featuring NFL football players,” Daniels said. “[The] stadium is definitely a change. Not like Mater Dei, but the Coliseum is pretty good too. In general, there’s just a lot of medium to big things that are a lot different.”

The first USC women’s soccer match that I watched, I was stunned. The Women of Troy defeated Cal Poly 6-1 on Aug. 24 and looked like they had everything figured out. By no means did they play perfect soccer, but they played with so much confidence and composure that they could have beaten any team on that day.       They meant business.
The Trojans had two impressive results over the weekend proving that they are not pretenders, but contenders this season. The Women of Troy traveled to Florida to battle the No. 4 Florida State Seminoles and the No. 22 Florida Gators. They came out of the weekend with a 3-0 victory against the Gators and a scoreless draw against the Seminoles.
The Women of Troy had their backs against the wall throughout the whole first half against the Seminoles. They were out-possessed and out-shot for most of the game against a really good opponent. While the Trojans weren’t playing their best soccer, they were able to grind out a draw and not lose to one of the best teams in the country, which, to me, was the most impressive part about the team this weekend.
A good tournament team in soccer isn’t always the one that has the best players on the pitch or that scores the most goals. The best tournament team is the one that doesn’t lose tough games and can deliver results even when they aren’t playing at their highest level. Against the Seminoles, the Trojans showed that they are able to do that on the road.
The Trojans play a 4-4-2 diamond midfield formation under head coach Keidane McAlpine. The diamond midfield allows them to play with one defensive midfielder, two box-to-box midfielders, and one attacking midfielder. It’s a balanced formation which releases redshirt sophomore midfielder Savannah DeMelo to play higher up the pitch and be more of a creative outlet.
Junior defensive midfielder Jalen Woodward is also an integral part of keeping the balance and the shape of this team. Her job offensively is to link up play from the backline towards the midfield to start the team’s possession. Defensively, she is tasked with helping the rest of the defense and staying behind to provide cover from the opposition’s midfield. With DeMelo playing higher up the pitch, it is important that Woodward stays back to stop teams from breaking on the counter-attack. Moreover, it is important that she wins back possession for the team.
Defensively, the Trojans have shown that they are compact and composed. It’s a cliché in all of sports, but in soccer, it is definitely true: defense wins championships. If a team doesn’t let up a goal, they can’t lose in open play since they can only get knocked out in a penalty shootout. This makes it crucial that the Trojans stay tight defensively throughout the season. 
Senior Ally Prisock is a quality leader of the backline and a no-nonsense defender. She started all 25 games in the 2016 season that won USC the national championship. Her experience is imperative to the success of the backline and to the overall success of the team.
Moreover, the Trojans showed in other games that they have a surplus of great quality in their team that can spark magical moments during their matches. DeMelo has shown already throughout the season that she can make anything happen out of nothing. The same can be said of senior forward Leah Pruitt. If the Trojans have an opponent like Florida State, they know that as long as they stay solid defensively, they have the offensive quality to change a game with one moment. One moment is all it takes to win a game.
The Trojans have a defense that doesn’t leak goals, a midfield that can maintain possession and create valuable opportunities, and a front-line that can score goals when called upon. In addition, they have a goalkeeper that has only allowed one goal this season and has a year of experience behind her. They have players sitting on the bench with international experience. Oh, and they have a coach who has already won a national championship. From top to bottom, the Trojans have the quality to face any team at any level and compete.

Ben Malcolmson was just searching for a good story to write for the Daily Trojan when he found himself on the roster of the top-ranked college football team in the country. Now, 12 years later, he still sits next to former USC coach Pete Carroll as his special assistant at the Seattle Seahawks. 
After covering the USC football team for three years for the student paper, Malcolmson decided to try out as a walk-on in Spring 2006 to get an inside look at the process for his Daily Trojan column. Two days later, he got a call: He made the team. 
“It was a golden opportunity, and I couldn’t pass it up. The door was wide open. I had to do it,” Malcolmson said. “[My options were] newspaper career or football for one year. [I said], ‘Let’s go for it. It’s a risk worth taking.’”
He hadn’t played organized football since his Pee Wee days, but in the fall he suited up as redshirt senior No. 24 on the sideline of the Coliseum. He enrolled in graduate school for journalism to stretch his eligibility.
Following a whole season of showing up to practice and overcoming a shoulder injury, Malcolmson finally received the moment he was waiting for from Carroll. No. 24 took the field against Notre Dame at the Coliseum on Nov. 25, 2006 for the very last snap before beating the Irish 44-24. 
“It was so surreal. I couldn’t even process things,” Malcolmson said, while reflecting on the play. “It felt like one of those movie scenes where you’re kind of removed from the situation. It’s hard to fathom even right now.” 
As powerful as that moment was for him, Malcomson knew he was involved in a greater spiritual purpose after getting the call that he made the team. He tried bringing Bible studies and prayer groups to the team but felt discouraged when these failed. As his final attempt, he anonymously gifted everyone on the team a Bible for Christmas, but he walked in the locker room one day to find them strewn all over the floor and thrown in trash cans. 
Malcolmson did not know the impact that he actually had on his team until he saw one of the Bibles on the coffin of his former teammate and friend, Mario Danelo, who passed away after falling off a cliff, as it was carried down the aisle just a few years later. It turned out that he didn’t know how to read a Bible, but he’d learned to just three days before his death. 
When the season ended, Carroll started a media website for updates on the football team.
“It was just the right place at the right time,” Malcolmson said.
Malcolmson commented on Carroll’s intentional relationships he built with everyone around him at USC and of the media, even just a student reporter like himself. With that mutual trust already established between them, he went to work on the USC football website. 
“It was like Twitter before Twitter,” Malcolmson said. “We had this blog that we updated like 15 times a day, so people just kept coming back to it. [It] was about bringing people on the inside.”
They continued working closely, and soon enough the bond that would last more than 14 years started forming. Carroll moved to Seattle and quickly asked Malcolmson to come up and do the same job he was doing with him at USC. He went, and transitioned to helping Carroll with whatever he needed. 
“Through [the work we did at USC], we developed such a good relationship because I was at his hip the whole time,” Malcolmson said. “And here we are, nine years later, still up in Seattle.”
On Friday, Malcolmson came back to USC and sat behind a table in front of the campus bookstore, signing copies of his recently published book, “Walk On.” He hugged the friends that came to support, wearing shirts that said “Get Ben In” with the number 24 on the back — replicas of what some students wore during his season to show their support —and passed them out to the line of people. Scot Obler, his old friend and photographer took pictures of Malcolmson talking to little kids with wide eyes and bouncy feet, excited to meet someone they admired.
The cover of his book reads, “From Pee Wee dropout to the NFL sidelines — my unlikely story of football, purpose, and following an amazing God.” It’s his raw story that he brings to people as a published author and inspirational speaker who has lived and learned from arguably one of the best coaches in all levels of football. He couldn’t have guessed back in 2006 that this would be where he is now. 
“This whole journey has taught me, [to take life] just one day at a time,” Malcomson said. “Whatever’s coming next is going to be amazing and far better than I can plan myself.”

Redshirt freshman safety Isaiah Pola-Mao recorded seven tackles against UNLV during his first game. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Isaiah Pola-Mao didn’t know he would be starting his first college football game until the Thursday before the game. The redshirt freshman was forced into action at safety after sophomore Bubba Bolden, who was set to start, was taken out of the lineup  for an undisclosed reason two days before the season opener against UNLV.
Bolden’s loss was Pola-Mao’s gain. Pola-Mao, who redshirted last season after sustaining a shoulder injury, made a statement with his very first play, forcing a fumble on UNLV’s opening play from scrimmage.
“I was overwhelmed with a lot emotions, and I was very sad for what Bubba was going through but I had to lock in and focus and clear my mind, get ready for this game,” Pola-Mao said.
Pola-Mao stripped UNLV running back Lexington Thomas of the ball deep in Rebel territory, setting up a short field for the USC offense, which produced a field goal that would get the Trojans on the board first. The Trojans easily won 43-21 at the Coliseum.
Pola-Mao was nervous before starting the game.
“Being away from football and not actually playing in a game, it’s a big difference,” he said. “Coming into my first college game, I was very anxious, so I just had to get the jitters out. Happened to be a big [play].”
It quickly endeared Pola-Mao with the veterans on the defensive corps.
“That was big, that was big, that was dope for him,” said redshirt senior cornerback Ajene Harris.
Senior linebacker  Cameron Smith said the situation could not have played out any better for the first-time starter.
“Anytime after that first play or that first series, you just calm down and just say, ‘It’s football,’” Smith said. “That’s what he needed to get him going and I thought he did a really good job for us today.”
There’s no better way to calm down than by forcing a turnover seconds into the game.
“I don’t think he saw me so I came in and just tried to punch it as hard as I could and landed right on,” Pola-Mao said on forcing the fumble.
Pola-Mao was originally slotted on the depth chart behind senior Marvell Tell at free safety, but slid over to strong safety once Bolden was unavailable. Head coach Clay Helton declined to provide details on Bolden’s situation after the announcement was made on Thursday, though a University spokesperson confirmed he was still on the roster.
Pola-Mao, a Phoenix native starred in high school at Mountain Pointe High, named to the Max Preps All-American first team in 2016. He also has football royalty in his blood — Pola-Mao’s uncle is former USC and NFL star safety Troy Polamalu and his great uncle, Kennedy Polamalu, played for USC from 1982 to 85 as a fullback and is now an assistant with the Minnesota Vikings.
Now, it’s Pola-Mao’s turn. Though he had nerves heading into his debut, the redshirt freshman said he had a good feeling about what was to come the night before the game.
“I was thinking about it,” Pola-Mao said. “I saw the opportunity and just took it.”
A reporter asked him to elaborate on what he felt.
“I felt me making a play, changing the game,” he said.

Financial literacy refers to an understanding of an array of fields related to money, including investment and personal finances. With financial distress consistently ranked among the top concerns for Americans, having tools to manage expenses and plan ahead can greatly improve lives and reduce stress. However, many young adults today are stabbing in the dark at how to plan their finances and do not know how to ask the right questions. This can lead to bad financial habits and poor decisions down the road. 
Currently, about 25 percent of millennials have overdue medical bills and 52 percent have engaged in costly credit card behaviors. According to a 2014 study conducted by the Financial Industry Regulatory Advisory on financial culpability in the United States, only 24 percent of millennial respondents can get between 80  and 100 percent on a financial literacy quiz. Even though students will graduate USC with prestigious degrees, they may leave without any knowledge of how to handle their finances.
One solution to this crisis of ignorance is offering courses on financial literacy on campus. When offered, 61 percent of millennials participate in financial literacy courses. Because college is often the first time students live on their own, it’s irresponsible to expect them to automatically make perfect spending and saving choices without teaching them about financial responsibility. By not having programs in place to support their decision-making the minute they step on campus, universities are placing their students at risk.
USC has a partnership with Salt, an online one-on-one counseling service for college students that focuses on loan repayment. They also offer advice on understanding credit and budgeting, but it takes a backseat to showing students how to deal with their loans. Students who take out federal loans are required to take online and in-person loan counselling to ensure they understand how their loan accrues interest and what they owe month by month.
These existing programs are helpful for those that they target but beyond that, USC students are on their own. There isn’t an on-campus support system to assist students with their finances. If they have questions, students have to look it up on a third party platform. Since financial literacy courses are not advertised or pushed by the school to the same degree that the career or wellness centers are, students may not know where to look to ease their monetary concerns.
USC should look to other schools and see what works. Harvard College offers a financial literacy section on their financial aid page to carry out their mission of “providing support and education in many areas of personal health — including financial understanding — for all students.” Broken into sections, students can look at resources about filing taxes, budgeting, investing, credit and more. Harvard University’s employee credit union also offers financial literacy classes.
To assist their students, Texas Tech initiated the Red to Black Program, which was named the number one financial literacy program in the nation by LendEU. Group presentations can be scheduled, but they also offer one-on-one coaching. Students can schedule appointments to go over their individual concerns for financial planning throughout college and beyond.
Programming doesn’t have to look exactly like the options offered at these schools. USC can introduce students to financial literacy with required courses taken before freshman year, similar to those on alcohol awareness. During the year, if students feel they need extra help, they should be able to meet with someone who can assess their problem and offer comprehensive planning solutions. Furthermore, a system should be in place to give extra support to lower income and first generation students, who are at a greater disadvantage than their peers. 
USC can and should do better for its students. To be truly successful in the college sphere and beyond, students need to have the fullest range of tools at their disposal. Expenses are not a fear for the distant future. Paying bills, establishing credit and budgeting are a part of a daily experience, and many are strategizing for them without a clear direction or starting point. If USC truly cares for the well-being of its students, it must offer more comprehensive solutions to assuage students’ financial fears.

As a thought experiment, think about a world nearly identical to ours. Same history, same geography, same people, with only one difference: All human beings have eradicated racism from their consciousness instantaneously.  In this hypothetical world, people no longer believe in racial stereotypes or subscribe to notions of their own racial superiority. Unfortunately, even in this idealist world — with no racist people — we’d still have a racist society.
Racism is often mistaken as a moral disease afflicting bad cops, Trumpsters and Paula Deen. But in reality, the issue is far more structural.
In 1860, at the start of the final decade of slavery, 12.6 percent of the U.S. population was in chains. After the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th Amendment, slaves were released into terrible conditions, which later put them at a significant systemic disadvantage. The end of slavery released over four million black Americans into poverty and discrimination.
For generations, black people were denied equal rights, education, housing, healthcare and basic empathy from a country dominated by white people. With the Plessy v. Ferguson decision in 1896, the federal government endorsed the principle of “separate but equal.” This precedent allowed for racial segregation and isolation of an entire population that was never given the chance to fully sustain itself. By the time “legal” segregation officially — although arguably — ended in 1964 with the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the alleged death of Jim Crow segregation, American people of color were already thrown into a deep hole of economic scarcity and inflexibility.
Fifty-four years after the “end of segregation,” black Americans are still severely disadvantaged in nearly every metric sense, and in many cases, to a more severe extent than they were in 1964. For example, according to a 2016 study by the Urban Institute, the average white family’s total wealth is $919,000, while the average black family’s wealth is only $140,000. The gap is seven times larger than it was in 1963.
The racial wealth gap is compounded by existing racial segregation. Nationwide, 75 percent of black students attend schools made mostly of people of color and 38 percent attend schools which have a white student population of 10 percent or lower. This segregation has been worsening since the 1990s, erasing much of the progress created by Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. This segregation is harmful because the principle of “separate but equal” remains untrue and unjust, just as it was during the Jim Crow era.
According to Beverly Daniel Tatum, president emerita of Spellman College, “schools with concentrated poverty and racial segregation are more likely to have less-experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities, and fewer classroom resources.” These schools’ lack of effectiveness limits the economic potential of their homogenous student body, as well as the similarly comprised student body that follows — perpetuating a vicious cycle of racially slanted poverty.
The worsening cycle of racist poverty proves a need for increased economic mobility, particularly amongst people of color, for which research has proven integration to be key. A long-term comprehensive study conducted by researchers at Harvard University and UC Berkeley found hometown density to be a major factor in determining the ability of a poor individual to escape poverty in his or her lifetime. Generally, the denser an area is, the less isolated its local economies are, allowing for more movement and interaction between weaker and stronger economies, increasing overall demand within communities that need it.
A complete lack of density, particularly in areas where poverty is concentrated, is why Los Angeles County ranks in the bottom 7th percentile of U.S. counties in economic mobility. Los Angeles’ famed sprawl is also notoriously segregated, with 60 percent of Angelenos of color living in communities where few whites are present, according to the 2010 census. Data suggests that this segregation and the consequent economic staticity of minorities are a result of not only our country’s racist history but also its  housing and zoning policies.
The L.A. City Council’s decision to incentivize denser construction along the Metro Expo line is a decision that will hopefully result in an uptick in affordable housing that lies in close proximity to more high-income residents. If the council diligently accounts for factors such as demand inflation with protections for low-income residents, this move could signify a trend that puts Los Angeles on track to become a
city where regardless of one’s race or economic background, everyone is granted a chance to be self-sustaining.
Fighting racism is more than fighting racists. It’s not enough to exorcize oneself of hatred, but one needs to maintain an academic diligence to the progress of those that history neglected through both direct and indirect discrimination. As long as Los Angeles and other cities remain this segregated, the process of ending American racism is stalled.

Playing an instrument was required at Daneyal Anwar’s public elementary school. He couldn’t practice drums in his family’s apartment building, so he chose to play violin; that was what his sister played, and naturally he had to out-perform her at everything. 
Anwar, a senior majoring in cognitive science, now produces experimental electronic music under the stage name Anvar. On Aug. 3, he released his debut album, “Sequences,” after 11 months of production. With it, he hopes to challenge the status quo of modern music and more importantly, make listeners think. 
“There is a genre for everything, just because people have a need to categorize things, but I always like avoiding genre-related questions,” Anwar said in a recent interview with the Daily Trojan in his home studio. “I want people to listen to the album and have that experience without already predetermining anything about it.”
Anwar’s music has evolved greatly over the years. At the beginning of his music-making career, he threw together  a bunch of hip-hop and rap tracks in Fruity Loop Studio (now known as FL Studio), a software that Anwar describes as just a step ahead of GarageBand. His early influences came largely from artists like Pharrell Williams and Radiohead artists. 
Though his musical library has grown since then, it still has ties to the early days. Today, he listens to a little bit of everything, largely depending on his mood. 
Anwar has been making music for half a decade, but “Sequences” was the first work he was ready to put out to the world. He explained that the most important thing for himself and other musicians to do is get their ideas onto the paper — or, in his case, onto the program. 
“They might be shitty for a long time,” he said. “That’s important to note.”
Most of the album was created in New Zealand, where Anwar spent the spring semester studying abroad. He arrived earlier than the bulk of his classmates and put in over seven-hour days working on music — taking a short break, then going back to work at night. 
“I had this incredible period of time,” Anwar said. “I had two weeks with me and my Kiwi hosts. I had complete freedom and I had no distractions.” 
It was in New Zealand that he met Caitlin Turner, the vocalist featured on “Sequences,” and recorded all of the album’s vocals, which have a deliberately non-human sound. 
“I wanted it to be very clearly like an instrument,” Anwar said. “I wanted to create a little bit of disconnect between the words she was saying and her voice itself. Her voice is the voice I’m hearing in my head.” 
That voice in his head, along with a slew of other influences, play a huge part in shaping Anwar’s music. 
“When I’m making music, I try to express myself through other people’s voices and other people’s perspectives,” he said. “Which is an exercise in some deranged form of humility, but I think it helps me be creative.”
That humility is evident to strangers and friends alike. Forest Clements, a guitarist featured on the sixth song on the album, said Anwar has a rare work ethic among musicians. 
“He works fast and hard,” Clements said. “He pushed his record out unreasonably fast and was wise to look for help mixing and mastering from other people instead of doing everything himself.”
The two met in their high school orchestra and have remained friends ever since. While producing the album, Anwar reached out to Clements with a song, “The Conch.” Clements happily joined the project. Clements explained that the duo worked so well together because of their shared approach to “making the puzzle fit” with music.
Anwar’s authenticity as an artist also stood out to Clements. “He’s not really trying to be anything else,” Clements said. “[‘Sequences’] almost feels robotic but if you compare that to who he is — a deeply analytical person — it feels like it’s coming from him.” 
Casual collaboration is strung throughout the album. After hearing a classmate play the drums in a songwriting class, Anwar decided to feature him on the album’s first track, “I Treat You Differently Because I Care.”
“When I’m making music, I try to express myself through other people’s voices and other people’s perspectives, which is an exercise in some deranged form of humility, but I think it helps me be creative,” Anwar said.
The album is made up of three sets of song trios linked by theme or style. The first have a dreamy, synthetic sound meant to reflect the world. The second set peer into what the artist is thinking and how he’s thinking about it, along with who he is and what he wants listeners to know about him. The last three, Anwar explained, “are more like what I’m feeling inside my head and inside my heart.”
The seventh track, “Walk With Me,” is an ode to the David Lynch series “Twin Peaks,” channeling its psychedelic world but with an experimental spin. The last song, “Snot by Alex G,” is Anwar’s favorite — a remake of instrumentalist Alex G’s original track, once again with Anwar’s uncommon flair. 
As a cognitive science major, Anwar has researched how extreme music affects people’s emotions. In the lab, small pads with electric conductors are placed on a subject’s arms, and researchers play extremely sad or happy music while monitoring the changes that take place in listeners’ bodies. 
Anwar ultimately wants to continue with this cognition research, expanding testing that he hopes will help with recommending treatment plans for mental health patients. Anwar believes music and other forms of therapy can be a solution to mental health issues rather than over-prescribing drugs. 
But even when he’s not in the lab, Anwar always has music on his mind, and it doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. 
“I have a million melodies floating around in my head,” Anwar said. “Whenever I’m listening to anything instrumental, I’m trying to find a new melody for it.” 
Those new melodies make his sound — they make Anvar.

It seemed as if, this summer in New York City, I could go nowhere without running into Ottessa Moshfegh’s “My Year of Rest and Relaxation.” Its distinctive hot pink cover, featuring Jacques-Louis David’s 1798 painting “Portrait of a Young Woman in White,” trailed me wherever I went: next to me on the subway platform, peeking out from the Artists & Fleas tote of a Brooklyn hipster; in the hands of a woman clothed in business casual, sitting across from me on the L train during our shared morning commute; near the entrance of every bookstore I walked into, greeting me from its perch on the Hot New Arrivals shelf. 
One reason for its prevalence may be that the book is set in New York City. But not modern day New York; the story takes place in the year 2001, in the months leading up to 9/11, lending it an eerie prescience as the narrative hurtles toward an inevitable conclusion. But other than the Upper East Side moms in Juicy Couture and the comparatively lax security measures at JFK, not much of the novel dates it. At least, many of the real-life locations remain unchanged, and I won’t deny the thrill of touring the Chelsea galleries and riding the Staten Island Ferry, spaces that had previously existed only on paper suddenly materializing before me.  
Another reason may be that the narrator’s sense of listlessness is enduring and universal, especially in these trying times. In “My Year of Rest and Relaxation,” the unnamed protagonist is a rich, hot blonde woman who worships at the altar of Big Pharma. Desperate to escape her existential ennui, she downs a dizzying concoction of pills, hoping to pass the time in a medically-induced slumber. With two dead parents, one fake friend and a steady stream of unemployment checks, there’s not much for her to live for, much less die for. Her casual privilege, blanket indifference and refusal to participate in grind culture seems to have a struck a chord, especially among stressed, depressed, but well-dressed millennials. 
Moshfegh herself is not a Hot New Arrival; her short story collection, “Homesick For Another World,” garnered critical acclaim, and her first novel, “Eileen,” was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize and snagged the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award. In the flurry of profiles that always follow a young, lauded up-and-comer, Moshfegh appears secure and self-assured, confident to the point of cockiness. Her author portrait shows her staring straight into the camera, sporting a smirk, radiating poise and self-possession. In an interview, she declares: “I’m not going to be making cappuccinos. I’m fucking brilliant!” This is a sentiment that may raise some eyebrows, yet one I can’t help but admire and aspire to emulate, though I possess no such faith in my own competence. 
My last week in New York coincided with the last leg of Moshfegh’s book tour promoting “My Year of Rest and Relaxation.” She would be in conversation with actress Lena Dunham at the Strand Bookstore. That Monday night saw me standing in line, umbrella-less in a rainstorm, for about an hour. 
I’m not sure what I expected: for Moshfegh to outswagger the famously brash Dunham? She was such a hotshot on the page, yet in person, she was awkward and far from charismatic. She spoke slowly, haltingly, and took her time to think before answering questions, resulting in long pauses filled with AC hum. Her sentences trailed off. She sat hunched in her oversized armchair. The discrepancy was especially heightened when contrasted against Dunham, a practiced performer clearly at ease in front of an audience, and her quick, slick, witty banter. 
After the talk, I became even more enamored with Moshfegh. “My Year of Rest and Relaxation” may have become a sensation because audiences related to its narrator, but for me, it was Moshfegh I related to: someone whose eloquence only translates in writing, who talks a big game from the safety of a laptop screen but is reserved and tentative in the flesh. Someone who gets tongue-tied when called upon in the spur of moment, someone who needs time to mull and meditate before being capable of producing anything with merit. I can only hope to possess half her brilliance — or at least enough of it to end up at the New Yorker, rather than Starbucks.

Virginia rapper and G.O.O.D. Music affiliate Pusha T made his way to Belasco Theater for the L.A. stop of his “Daytona Tour.” (Matthew Philips | Daily Trojan)
Swaths of hip-hop fans swarmed the streets of downtown Los Angeles Saturday night for a show from one of the genre’s most successful artists this year, Pusha T. The respected emcee and music executive was fresh off a scorching hot summer that saw two pivotal events in his 25-plus year career: the release of his critically acclaimed album “Daytona” and his public feud with Drake that peaked with Pusha’s “The Story of Adidon.” Both events have given Pusha a late-career surge that few aging industry veterans are able to replicate, and he’s ridden the wave with little adversity since.
The historic Belasco Theater served as the venue for the Virginia rapper’s L.A. stop of his “Daytona Tour.” Minimalist-themed merchandise with memorable lines from his latest album littered the front, but the age-diverse crowd quickly shuffled past into the front, where the opening act took to the stage at around 8:15 p.m.
G.O.O.D. Music labelmate Valee provided for a disappointing opener. Even with a packed room and eager faces, the Chicago rapper failed to galvanize the crowd with his sleepy stage presence and staggering apathy. Rushing through songs from his “1988” mixtape and “GOOD Job, You Found Me” EP, he displayed little concern for the lack of audience engagement. Unsurprisingly, Valee and his not-so-hype hypeman left the stage after only half an hour. 
Ten minutes later, as plumes of white smoke clouded the stage and fluorescent lights penetrated the dark, a noticeable change in temperature took over the room, and stifled cheers rang throughout. Seconds later, a confident voice yelled out, and Pusha T began to recite the opening bars to “Daytona’s” fiery intro “If You Know You Know.” Then, at the song’s first instrumental switch-up, the 41-year-old rapper emerged from the foggy stage in a black jumpsuit, and commanded the audience with the youth and vigor of someone half his age.
The set’s first few songs came from his latest project, the Kanye West-produced album that was recorded in Utah and West’s vacation home in Jackson, Wyo. The album’s Western influence could be heard in the production, especially in tracks like “The Games We Play” and “Come Back Baby,” and Pusha T’s charismatic drug dealer-inspired raps provided for a healthy marriage with West’s instrumental edge.
Pusha then reached back into his last several years under the G.O.O.D. Music label, performing “My Name Is My Name” singles “Nosetalgia” and “Numbers on the Boards.” He also performed his verses from hit songs, like West’s ballad “Runaway” and the Ghostface Killah-sampled “New God Flow.” He even turned back the clock to his days as a member of Clipse, playing the Neptunes-produced 2000s hit “Grindin’” to the crowd’s excitement.  
To everyone’s surprise, Pusha T invited a young fan with him onstage to perform hits such as “Santeria” and “What Would Meek Do?” Pusha said that the child caught his attention after rapping along to every word from atop his father’s shoulders at the previous night’s show in Santa Ana. The fan looked as excited as anyone would taking the stage with one of their favorite artists, and he held his own as Pusha T’s temporary hypeman.
The set soon came to a close as Pusha T saved his best tricks for last. In a surprise turn of events, Kid Cudi’s tortured vocals on “Feel The Love” blared, and the Pusha T began to rap along to the Kids See Ghosts hit song to an audience eager for more. He ended the set with verses from his features on three mega-hit tracks: G.O.O.D. Music posse cut “Mercy;” Future’s coke-slinging street anthem “Move That Dope;” and the label’s remix of Chief Keef’s club banger “Don’t Like.”
The audience members rose up and thrashed with one another for the club-tearing trio of songs before settling down when Pusha stopped to speak. Here, the aged hip-hop kingpin took a moment to thank the crowd for coming out and proclaim his love for Los Angeles, which patrons quickly reciprocated with cheers and requests for an encore. Pusha T was done, however, and he had more than earned a break after his charged performance.

 After last week’s Undergraduate Student Government meeting featured a long, impassioned debate regarding the University’s diversity fund in which a proposed amendment to the fund was tabled until Sept. 18, Tuesday’s meeting featured a more mellow discussion.  
Following brief speeches from the Senior Director of Programming Keisuke Fujiwara and Speaker Pro Tempore Matt Crane, the Senate unanimously approved AJ Singh as the new Chief Justice of USG. Singh is a senior majoring in political science and non-governmental organizations and social change who has been an associate justice on the USG judicial branch since his freshman year. There was no debate prior to his appointment.
The previous chief justice, Charlynn Yeung, graduated last year and nominated Singh to take her place. Following Singh’s nomination, he was approved by USG President Debbie Lee, and confirmed by the senate on Tuesday. 
The approval process is heavily based on the discretion of the former chief justice and an element of trust between the two USG branches. 
“It has been precedent that we fully trust that the chief justice will make the wisest decision,” Lee said. 
The judicial branch of USG is intentionally detached from the legislative branch in the name of checks and balances. Therefore, the chief justice carries out a very limited relationship with other branches of USG. 
“As USG members who have the potential to be called into a session with [the] judicial [branch],” Lee said, “We shouldn’t know … the justices in a relationship where their biases may affect certain decisions where complete objectivity is needed.” 
The senate approved of Singh based on their trust in Yeung to nominate a capable individual to succeed her. Singh will serve for the rest of the academic year as the USG Chief Justice until the process repeats next fall.

GOP strategist Michael Murphy and Democratic political strategist Robert Shrum will lead the Center for the Political Future.(Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
With the rising political tension and the upcoming 2018 midterm elections, the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences announced its new Center for the Political Future on Tuesday. 
Led by Robert Shrum, and Democratic political strategist and the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, and veteran GOP strategist Michael Murphy, the Center will feature research projects, endowed chairs and fellowships and public policy polling to educate students on civic participation. 
According to Shrum, Unruh is an institute that encourages students to become politically involved by introducing them to political science studies with field experience. Both Unruh and USC Dornsife/The Los Angeles Times polls, which monitors popular topics amongst voters and how they view certain political figures, will be under the Center. 
Murphy said the purpose of the Center is to advance a dialogue based on mutual respect for each other and the facts.
“We want to make the Center a place where we work on how to change the incentives to bring civility back to politics,” Murphy said. “We’re not expecting people to agree, but to argue in a way that respects the facts where we break this new political law of gravity.”
According to USC News, the college hopes to serve as a new model to create political discussion and analysis for the future. The center aspires to advance dialogue among partisan divisions, and to seek solutions for challenges the nation is facing. 
The center will host major conferences and workshops every year where professionals and scholars can discuss rising concerns to the public in a nonpartisan manner. With this program, students will understand the reasoning behind political divisions, work to create solutions and to approach policies in various ways. Some issues that may be featured include immigration, ideological radicalization and electoral reform. 
For this academic year, the Center is organizing the Law-Warschaw Practical Politics Conference after the midterm election, and will host a joint conference with USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies on the practical politics of climate change.
To have students engage with political leaders, the center will feature a resident fellows program to introduce prominent figures to the campus each semester. This semester,  Dan Schwerin, former director of speechwriting for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016, and Gentry Collins, former national political director of the Republican National Committee, will be invited to campus. Symone Sanders, former national press secretary for Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign, will be invited in Spring 2019. 
According to Shrum, the resident fellows will teach courses at USC. For this semester, Schwerin will lead a speechwriting course and Collins will teach on the future of the Republican Party. 
In addition to the new resources for students, the center will offer different types of research, such as a project on disruptive new technologies in relation to politics. 
“I hope the center does two things: enriches the education and life of students, engages them politically and encourages their interest in not just politics, but being involved in the public square,” Shrum said. “I hope that the University can have an impact on the world beyond its gates. To have that impact means to bring that world to the University and to bring the University to that world.”

When Monica Tacanga stares out through her steel screen doors at the street where she grew up, she sees a neighborhood in constant flux. From notorious gang activity to a new freeway carrying smog and dust, the 3900 block of Flower Drive has seen it all, according to Tacanga. Eight historic multi-story buildings, constructed in 1922 during the era of streetcars, have stood there all this time.
“It’s three generations living here,” Tacanga, 40, said. Her parents moved into the one-bedroom apartment in the 70s, and raised her on the block. Tacanga, a single mother, would raise her daughter in the same unit, on the same street. Two years ago, her father passed away in the apartment.
Tucked between an empty parking lot and the 10 Freeway, the block of residential buildings half a mile south of campus is home for families like Tacanga’s, with multigenerational, decades-long ties to the community. 

But soon, she and dozens of other residents may have to leave as developers prepare to demolish their buildings to make way for hundreds of new residences — including housing targeted to USC students.

Since 2014, real estate development and investment firm Ventus Group has supported construction of a mixed-use development on the 3900 block. The Fig Project, which is currently under review by the Los Angeles City Council, will take up 4.42 acres, including a 7-story hotel, 222 units of student housing, 186 units of residential housing and a commercial retail space. Under the group’s current plan, outlined in a draft environmental impact report to the city, the project will demolish 32 rent-controlled housing units, which are also designated historic buildings by the state of California.
“We really are going to have some concerted effort to … enable low-income people to stay in the city,” said Cynthia Strathmann, executive director of Strategic Actions for a Just Economy, a nonprofit that advocates for tenant and community rights. “The Fig Project is really emblematic of that. You have historic buildings with low-income people, mostly of people of color who have lived there for a long time.”
Ventus Group declined to comment on the tenants’ situation to the Daily Trojan. Since hearing about the project two years ago, SAJE has held community meetings and workshops to educate tenants about housing rights and the processes leading up to their potential eviction. 
There is no certain date on the groundbreaking of the project, but the development is on schedule for Fall 2019, said John David Booty, Ventus Group’s executive vice president. He added that the developer aims to begin a public hearing process with the city within the next several months. 
Ventus Group has had periodic conversations with the University, and the project’s proposal came even before the USC Village was announced, according to Booty. 
“We felt there was a great demand for student housing around USC, and that still holds true given the occupancy in most of the student housing,” Booty said.
Living in uncertainty
Tacanga said she is desperate for an outcome other than eviction or demolition. 
“I got so desperate one day that I’m like, I just want to go straight to the developer’s face and tell them, ‘What the hell are they doing?’” Tacanga said, her voice shaking. “Come and see for yourself — don’t send your representatives.”
But she is not alone in her desperation. For most residents on the block, English is not their native language, and some are elderly, disabled or living on fixed income, according to Maria Ochoa, a SAJE organizer.
﻿﻿
The Fig Project will contain 82 units of affordable housing, out of 186 units, for families making less than 80 percent of the Los Angeles County median income. Households making less than $54,000 a year would be eligible, but South Central Los Angeles’ median income, at $31,000, is markedly lower than that of the county’s.
But Ochoa said residents are still worried about finding a place to live if they are evicted, particularly while the new affordable housing units are under construction.
“In this rental climate where rents are extremely expensive and choice spaces that are healthy and inhabitable are [difficult to find] for families who are low-income, it’s not a great time looking for spaces,” Ochoa said. 
For some tenants, the cost of moving is too steep to consider.
“As poor people, we say without money, we can’t do anything,” Tacanga said. “Right now, if they were to come and tell us to leave, me, my mom and my daughter would be out on the street.” 
Her family of three lives from paycheck to paycheck, in a one-bedroom apartment with a kitchen, dining space and living room, for around $500 a month — a price they are unlikely to find anywhere else. 
The average monthly rent for a one-bedroom in Los Angeles is $2,068, while a studio apartment costs $1,622, according to a Rent Cafe report.
Vanessa Anguiano, Tacanga’s neighbor and close friend, also admitted her family would not be able to afford current housing rates. Anguiano’s mother has been submitting applications to live in a retirement home to ease their financial burden if the evictions become a reality, but the process can take years, she said.
“I’ve been searching on Zillow and the cheapest thing in this area within 10 miles is like $1,200 [per month] for a studio or maybe a one-bedroom,” Anguiano said. “There are hardly any available.”
SAJE is helping to advocate for collective bargaining power among the tenants, although the organization is not directly representing them in future negotiations with the developers or property owners. 
During a community meeting in late August, Ochoa stood in front of about 15 tenants, speaking animatedly and switching between English and Spanish. 

“No matter what your language, your voice is powerful,” she said.
Ochoa encouraged the tenants to avoid taking private “cash for keys” buyouts from the landlord to increase their leveraging power as a group. If evicted, tenants are entitled to relocation assistance fees under the Ellis Act, a state provision that allows landlords to remove tenants if the property is leaving the rental market — in this case by demolition. Relocation fees are given out by the city to each unit, based on factors such as income levels, duration of stay, family size and age.
The tenants believe they should receive just compensation for leaving their homes that will allow them to have a comfortable transition. Elyse Valenzuela, a 26-year-old-tenant, is one of the representatives who will advocate for the community when the time for negotiations comes.

The relocation assistance amounts listed by the city are minimum amounts, and are guidelines in case a private agreement is reached between a tenant and developers. Valenzuela hopes the residents can reach an equitable financial agreement based on each household’s circumstance. 
“At the end of the day, we’re all in this together, so we might as well join forces,” Valenzuela said. “Every family’s situation is different, but everyone has stayed [to negotiate] with SAJE.”
Some tenants have invested in personal renovations for their units, making them unwilling to leave a place they’ve spent time and money fixing up. Valenzuela’s family, who has lived there for 27 years, had renovated their hardwood floors, painted the walls white and added new windows to modernize the unit. 
A working-class history
While tenants have personal and financial reasons for wanting to stay on Flower Drive, the West Adams Heritage Association’s goal is to preserve the historic designation and conservation of the buildings on the 3900 block. Demolition of the buildings is not an ideal situation for the organizations or the city, said association member Jim Childs. 
The 3800 and 3900 blocks of Flower Drive are under a historic preservation overlay zone, which was designated by the state of California in 2008, according to public land records.
“It’s an assault on historic preservation,” Childs said. “They don’t have to do this, they’re choosing to do this … The development can happen without the loss of historic stock.” 
As an example, Childs cited the 3800 block of Flower Drive, where developers are also seeking to build new structures. But there, their plan is to build around the historic houses, preserving their exteriors rather than demolishing them.
While historic preservation status might not prevent tenant displacement, Childs is hopeful that at least the buildings’ exteriors will remain. A key factor in what makes certain buildings historical is their social significance, which requires people to inhabit them. According to Childs, Flower Drive is one of the few preserved affordable housing structures in the city.
“It doesn’t have to be grand to be part of the narrative of the history of Los Angeles,” Childs said.

Many tenants did not realize their homes had historic value, but they did recognize the sense of community and unique social interactions the neighborhood provided them.“A lot of the details in the apartment, you can feel the history — that it’s a part of us,”  said resident Shaquinta Prince, 32. “It concerns me that anything in L.A. they want to tear … down instead of repurposing these buildings, or refurbishing them and investing into them.”
