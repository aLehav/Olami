More than 60 USC students, faculty and alumni rallied before Tommy Trojan Friday afternoon to demonstrate solidarity with Mahsa Amini, whose death has sparked massive nationwide protests in Iran. 
Amini, a 22-year-old woman from the Kurdistan province of Iran, died on Sept. 16 in a Tehran hospital, three days after she was arrested and detained by Iranian morality police for not properly wearing her hijab. 
The police claimed that Amini fell into a coma when she stayed at a detention center to receive training on hijab laws. She was later transferred to a hospital and died due to a heart attack. The Iranian coroner released a new report Friday verifying that Amini didn’t die due to blows to the head or limbs, but instead from multiple organ failures caused by hypoxia. 
Amini’s relatives denied she had suffered any heart condition before; instead, they stated with the support of eyewitnesses that the morality police had beaten Amini after they arrested her. 
The march started in Hahn Plaza and continued along Trousdale Parkway to USC Village, where protesters stopped at the Hecuba statue to speak out their pain and hopes for change in Iran. 
“[Amini] is one of the thousands of lives that [are] being captured by Islamic Republic of Iran,” said Nazanin, a research fellow at the Annenberg Innovation Lab, in a speech during the march. Nazanin requested that only her first name be used in fear of political retaliation. “We have the opportunity to say it loud, to shout … This is the first time that I can shout my voice without the fear of teargas.”
“We have the opportunity to say it loud, to shout … This is the first time that I can shout my voice without the fear of teargas.”
Nooshin Neshkaty, a USC graduate from Iran, said she felt “furious, sad and mad” when she first heard the news of Amini’s death. 
“From the first day that this government has taken place in Iran, they have taken the rights away from women,” Neshkaty said. “Hijab is one area of the oppression that you see toward women, but there are many oppressive rules toward women.”
Protesters chanted “women, life, freedom,” “freedom for Iran” and “Mahsa Amini” to show their support for the ongoing protests for women’s rights in Iran. 
One of the individuals participating at the event, Rana Aghababazadeh, an Iranian American senior majoring in biotechnology, said the lack of freedom for women in Iran has been pervasive and overbearing.
“[There are] laws that prevent women from having basic rights that people in America, I think, take for granted,” Aghababazadeh said. “We don’t think about the fact that women can’t become judges in Iran … [that] we cannot sing in public, we cannot dance in public, men and women are not allowed to hold hands in public.”
Amid the widespread protests, Iran began shutting down the internet Sept. 19 and restricted the sharing of videos that highlight brutal clashes between civilians and police. On Friday, the mother of teenager Nika Shakarami accused Iranian authorities of murdering her daughter, who died during protests.
Iran Human Rights, a nonprofit organization in Norway, reported at least 154 protesters, including children, killed and thousands arrested since the protests began last month. This represents the largest death toll since the violent crackdown on protests against abrupt fuel price increases in November 2019. However, there is a growing feeling among USC protesters, human rights activists and policy experts that current protests mark a turning point in Iran’s policy on human rights. 
“I’ve never seen such an international response to a movement in Iran,” Aghababazadeh said. “I’ve never seen Iranians rally the way they have all across the world in so many different countries.”
“I’ve never seen Iranians rally the way they have all across the world in so many different countries.”
Niki Tavakoli, a doctoral student studying biomedical engineering who attended Friday’s march, said the protest helps to spread the voice of Iran to the international world.
“It feels like, with this movement, we’ve reached a point of no return,” Tavakoli said. “If this stops, eventually, it’s going to get even worse.” 
President Carol Folt also shared her support for Iranian women in an Instagram post Sept. 28. 
“Our hearts go out to the Iranian women risking their lives for freedom and dignity. I join many of the members of USC’s Iranian community in admiration of their bravery,” Folt wrote.
Morteza Dehghani, an associate professor of psychology and computer science, attended the march and praised Folt’s initial response to the ongoing Iranian situation.
“The President [made the] right move. She tweeted and expressed her support early on, which is something the previous administration would have never done. We thank President Folt for that, but we need more,” Dehghani said.
Another faculty member, Assal Habibi, also took part in Friday’s events. She explained that she felt USC needed to do more to recognize the effect of the recent events on the USC student body, in which there is, according to Dehghani, the “largest number of Iranian students in any university outside of Iran.” 
“[Students] have a hard time describing to professors and their friends and classmates that this is a giant emotional burden,” Habibi said. “As far as USC goes, we want the administration to support the Iranian students that are already here, [because] maybe they can’t meet academic deadlines [or] have friends who have been arrested in Iran.” 
Habibi also suggested accommodating prospective USC students by deferring application deadlines, because Iran is “going through war in a different way.”
Aghababazadeh, however, said she feels Folt’s initial response was not adequate for the scale of the matter. 
“I am not happy with the way USC has responded to this,” Aghababazadeh said. “For Black Lives Matter, as they should, USC put out statements, put out posts about Black History Month. For [the Russian invasion of Ukraine], they issued a statement and an email. All we’ve seen from Carol Folt is an Instagram post of less than 20 words.” 
Dehghani said supporting the movement through traditional means of fundraising and financial aid is “very tricky [for all involved] because of all the economic sanctions against Iran.”“If you’re raising money, the money cannot directly go into Iran. You have to think of alternative ways of supporting,” Dehghani said. “For example, there are several GoFundMe pages for supporting specifically students whose parents are in Iran, whose families are in Iran.”
Friday’s march at USC was one of a series of demonstrations that have taken place in Los Angeles. On Oct. 1, thousands of protestors also congregated outside L.A. City Hall. The day after, a large rally also took place in Westwood. Those who care about women’s freedoms in Iran, Aghababazadeh said, should continue in the same vein.
“It starts with grassroots movements and getting our representatives to get the country to acknowledge what’s happening in Iran,” Aghababazadeh said.

A fixture of the USC Languages department on campus since last November,  the Trojan Bloom multilingual literary journal aims to provide a creative outlet to writers in non-English languages taught at USC — and expand the journal to cover more languages spoken in the wider campus community.
Funded by the USC Center for Language and Culture, Trojan Bloom aims to bring together those interested in non-English creative writing and language learning by compiling a variety of poetry, prose and other miscellaneous pieces, and represents the 15 languages that are taught in the campus department. Now in their second semester-wide issue, they will feature a guest language program that will represent languages that may not have a USC course, but that are spoken frequently — for the fall semester, this is Armenian.
To produce Armenian as the guest language for the semester’s journal, Trojan Bloom is in collaboration with the USC Institute of Armenian Studies, which will assist with editing and proofreading submissions. Editor-in-chief Tania Apshankar, a senior studying creative writing, said the decision to add Armenian for the fall was a step to reflect a well-established Los Angeles language — a city home to over 200,000 Armenians — and to provide a platform during a difficult period in modern Armenian history.
“First, we wanted to include languages which reflect the community in L.A., and Armenian is a language that’s spoken a lot generally … as well as [due to] the unrest going on,” Apshankar said. “Unfortunately, there’s been [a] war situation with Azerbaijan, and we just wanted to provide a platform for people to express themselves.”
For Shushan Karapetian, deputy director of the USC Institute of Armenian Studies and guest editor for Trojan Bloom, ensuring that her students’ voices were heard was paramount. Her expertise lies in the study of languages outside of their native contexts, and she encouraged her students to submit work that spoke to the rich linguistics and cultural heritage of Armenia that honored all parts of their identities.
“Thematically, these pieces will kind of reflect the crisis that so many of these students are living [through], regardless of whether or not they directly talk about the war right now. I think that kind of diasporic angst and existential anxiety will come out [in students’ works] whether it’s about language, whether it’s about the state of Armenia being in danger or just of Armenian identity in general flux,” Karapetian said. 
One student working to meet this intent is Mariam Manukyan, a senior majoring in political science and contributor to the journal, who said she believes writing in the Armenian language allows her to better articulate her complex feelings. Manukyan’s work centers on her existential anxieties as she explores the political and ethnic tensions in Armenia, and her pieces include both formal and informal Armenian, which she said enables her to bring more of herself to the page.  
“There’s some stuff regarding [my] emotions that I can only speak in Armenian because that’s what’s close to me,” Manukyan said. 
Writer Merri Kuyumjian, a senior majoring in international relations, said she was excited to have found a platform through Trojan Bloom and appreciated the opportunity to see the poem she wrote and translated with her grandfather get published. 
“To be able to celebrate our culture through our language and our literature is just really awesome, and that we get to share it with non-Armenians is even better … it’s kind of like USC is giving us a voice and it almost makes us feel like, ‘Yeah, we do matter on campus, our culture and our heritage does matter on campus,’” Kuyumjian said. “To have that experience with my grandpa [too] was super awesome.” 
Trojan Bloom will be accepting submissions until Oct. 9 and accepts works in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Classical Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Persian, Polish, Russian — and Armenian.
