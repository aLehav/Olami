The echoes of the college admissions scandal continue to rock USC, and a new development has arisen with the trial of Robert Zangrillo. It was well revealed that Zangrillo, along with making a $200,000 payment to Rick Singer, the main defendant in the Varsity Blues case, made a payment of $50,000 to a USC official’s account. 
On Sept. 3, Bloomberg reported that Zangrillo’s defense attorneys believe they’ve uncovered evidence of a “university-wide program linking big donations and promises of future gifts with decisions on who gets in.” Zangrillo and his lawyers alleged that USC used a “special interest” tag to single out students who the University knew would bring in large donations. 
While USC has denied that this process has any impact on admission, it begs the greater question of the lack of formal processes surrounding special interest tagging and tracking of these candidates throughout the admission process.
Zangrillo and his defense attorneys have made some startling claims. The same Bloomberg article reports that the attorneys “cited a list of ‘special interest’ candidates from 2012 to 2015 that includes notations of donations for many, such as ‘$3 mil to Men’s Golf-Thailand,’ ‘$15 mil’ and ‘previously donated $25K to Heritage Hall.’” The article continues, noting 80% of students with this tag were admitted to the University. 
Such allegations have serious ramifications for the University if proven true. USC claims on its admissions page that it conducts “a comprehensive, holistic review of your application to consider academic and personal characteristics.” 
However, if students could get in just because of a large dollar amount by their last name, it would be hard to claim that this accurately describes the admission process. In addition, this association of students with a specific dollar amount seems to place the University’s interest in donations rather than in accepting the most qualified candidates regardless of finances.
With USC hotly contesting the claims and the court date for Zangrillo’s bribery case still on the horizon, it’s important to understand the University’s counterargument. While USC does not dispute its use of the “special interest” tag, undergraduate Dean of Admission Timothy Brunold said that the majority of candidates with this tag are not accepted. However, the University’s analytics seem to counter that, as they don’t track the number of special interest applicants accepted to USC. 
While the University has said that Zangrillo’s lawyers have “demanded reams of far-flung and ultimately irrelevant records,” the information Zangrillo has recovered is highly relevant. And while it may not pertain directly to his daughter’s case, it raises bigger questions for the University at large.
The most concerning part of this special interest tagging is its lack of oversight and its informality. 
USC attorneys have said that the process “isn’t formalized,” leading to questions about the validity of the process. Assuming the University’s claims are correct, and especially if Zangrillo’s lawyers’ claims are, USC has been ignoring this tagging’s effect on students’ admission. In addition, if 80% of these candidates are admitted, it should be something that the University is fully aware of. The use of the system as a way to correlate students with possible donations appears highly irresponsible and an abuse of the system. USC already has this process set up, and it should become more formalized if it truly has a measurable impact on admission statistics.
Instead of using this special interest tag to single out large donations, the University should use it to flag candidates who might otherwise have been overlooked in the application process. USC prides itself on its holistic admission process. This “special interest” distinction benefits affluent candidates who already have an edge in the admissions process due to access to better education and test prep. 
The University should use this distinction to give an edge to those who may not have the same advantages but who show promise in creative fields like art and film that cannot be assessed by test scores. Giving disadvantaged applicants a deserved leg up in the admission process will help increase diversity in future classes and ensure that USC’s holistic admission process stays intact.

With the presidential election fast aproaching, a flush of polls hoping to predict its outcome has arrived. Most tilt in favor of President Donald Trump’s Democratic rivals, as was the case with one reported by Fox News that placed him behind candidates Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris. While many Democrats find these predictions reassuring, the stats are reminiscent of those published leading up to the 2016 election, one of which gave former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton a 99% chance of securing the presidency. 
Today, the number might better represent our pre-Trump naiveté, but it should also remind us to be realistic about the odds. It is true that Trump does not have the same standing as he did coming into the 2016 election, campaigning as an underdog with the benefit of a somewhat unprecedented candidacy. For better or for worse, the American people have witnessed the reality of a term under Trump, and many are soured on the prospect of another. His approval ratings have hovered around a discouraging 40% throughout his presidency and slipped to 36% as of early August. This dip may be attributed to his recent attacks on the “squad” of four congresswomen of color and the polarizing treatment of immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. 
Perhaps the most crucial factor in the prediction of 2020’s presidential election is the state of the economy, which tends to be a reliable indication of a sitting president’s chance at re-election. As a general rule, people who are satisfied with their financial outlook are more likely to stick with the incumbent administration. Economists have predicted that a recession is nearing, and the warning signs — an 800-point dip in the Dow Jones, for instance — are flashing. Though Trump’s initiation of an aggressive and unyielding trade war with China may not be the root cause, he would stand to lose voters if a recession were to occur. 
But it would be foolish to rest the outcome of this election on the workings of a highly fickle economy (and uncouth to hope that a recession will arrive for political purposes). But it  would also be a mistake to underplay the likelihood of Trump winning. As we have seen, the man may not be so easily written off.
There is a reason that his approval rates have remained stagnant these past years. He has cultivated — wittingly or otherwise — a cult of personality that inspires impressive support. Democratic candidates will have a hard time budging the stauncher of his followers, whereas Trump’s flashy and derisive political style may very well pull moderates and Democrats to his side. Unlikely as voter crossover may seem, a deciding factor in 2016 was the millions of Trump voters who had voted for former President Barack Obama in 2012. 
This trend makes sense when you look at which areas swung: mainly struggling Rust Belt states that were looking to bounce back from heavy job loss these past years. Trump, along with the Republican Party, has a strong demographic advantage in these crucial swing states, such that he could lose the popular vote by several million ballots and still win the election (as occurred in 2016).
Another 2016 trend of note was the Russian interference in American voting systems and social media. Leading up to the election, thousands of fake accounts spread misinformation over the internet intending to sway Americans away from Clinton. The Russian government was also involved in the hacking of a Democratic National Committee server, releasing emails and information that damaged Clinton’s campaign. As the GOP recently struck down several election security bills, Trump may again proceed with the added advantage of a foreign government’s support.
This is all to say that Trump is not out of the race — and should not be considered as such until the ballots are tallied and the outcome has been declared. If a Democratic candidate can rouse voters with a substantial message instead of trusting Trump to self-disqualify, then they will have an honest chance of winning the election. If Trump manages to recapitalize on the moral divisions, immigration fears and economic angst of the American people, then he might amble again to the Oval Office.
The only surety is that this year will test the strength of the nation, its institutions and its people. For the time being, it is important to keep in mind that a nation is more than its president. The pursuit of democracy and liberty persist over the four-year term, and whether Trump wins or loses, it will be sure to prevail.

USC will subsidize 50% of public transit costs of University employees in the new USC Transit Subsidy Program, President Carol Folt announced in a letter to faculty and staff Tuesday. The program will take effect Oct. 1.
According to the USC News release, the USC Transportation-administered program, which improves upon a previous subsidy that was discontinued in 2015, will provide greater incentive for all USC employees in the United States to take the bus or rail to work, aiming to reduce the number of single-passenger cars for commute purposes. 
“One common request I heard during my listening tours was how much our staff and faculty wanted their transit subsidy back,” Folt said in the release. “I’m especially thankful to our employees in the HR community for expressing their wishes, and that we could quickly restore and improve upon the program. Choosing public transit is a great way to positively impact our environment on a daily basis.”
Folt wrote that the program will supplement the existing options made available to graduate and undergraduate students. The discount, Folt wrote, will be established in addition to lower base rates negotiated by transit partners including those in LA Metro, Metrolink and the Los Angeles Department of Transportation.
According to the release, USC Transportation will offer employees LA Metro E-Passes that can be purchased through the USC Transportation services office. The E-Passes grant access to all Metro rail, Metro local buses, Metro Rapid buses, LADOT DASH and Culver City and Pasadena Transit municipal buses. Additionally, the subsidy can be applied to LA Metro EZ Transit, Commuter Express and Metrolink passes. 
“Metro’s E-Pass Program makes transit easier to ride for employees by providing unlimited boardings on multiple transit agencies,” Phillip Washington, CEO of Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said in the release. “The E-Pass has increased transit riders by participating employers up to 15%.”
Compared to the program discontinued in 2015, which capped at $30 per employee per month, the new subsidy program will allow employees to pay for the E-Passes with payroll deductions in pre-tax dollars. According to the release, this will provide “even greater value” to faculty and staff enrolling in the program.
The subsidy also marks the “first step” in a “comprehensive transportation demand management plan” that will be included in the Sustainability 2028 Plan currently in development. 
“Transportation demand management is an essential part of modern urban planning,” the release read. “At its simplest level, it is about providing travelers with additional commuting options; this is most frequently used in an effort to minimize the number of cars on the road, especially single-passenger vehicles.”

Former  Undergraduate Student Government Senator Jacquelyne Tan proposed a resolution at Tuesday’s USG Senate meeting to launch an online course evaluation platform that would be accessible within USC’s Web Registration. 
Tan, who presented the resolution on the Senate floor, spoke with the Center for Excellence in Teaching, Academic Senate and the Board of Trustees for Academic Affairs Committee to gain an understanding of the issue at hand prior to drafting the resolution. Initially passed under the previous senate last semester, the new resolution aims to provide a link to student evaluations of professors that can be included on USC’s course registration website, allowing for a more comprehensive review of all classes and professors.
According to Tan, the student-accessible platform would hopefully eliminate the need for students to rely on the popular peer feedback site RateMyProfessors, which Tan said provides an inaccurate review of classes.
“The premise of that platform was never to take professors into account,” Tan said. “It was made for students’ convenience. I kind of hate that just because it’s a two-way street, students should be respectful of professors regardless of how they experienced their class.” 
Tan also indicated that RateMyProfessors does not have a complete review of all courses and professors available at USC. 
The resolution referenced recent studies from Innovative Higher Education and St. John’s Law Review that revealed racial and gender bias is often evident in student evaluations of professors. These biases have been displayed on RateMyProfessors. Tan hoped that a platform moderated by USC would mediate the misrepresentation of teachers and hold students accountable. 
“For RateMyProfessors, it’s more likely that if somebody hates a class, they’ll write on it,” Tan said. “It’s just so skewed.” 
Sen. Christopher McMorran, who sponsored the resolution, agreed that the current system of peer review fails to provide a fair, comprehensive look at professors.
“It’s not really moderated, so some of the comments may be a little off color or might not really be the most constructive information you might need,” McMorran said. 
According to the resolution, USC recently changed the tenure and promotion review process to lean more heavily on student evaluations to reflect class engagement opposed to an assessment of ability. The resolution intends to help provide more accurate feedback to be used in this crucial review process.
Student-accessible platforms have been implemented at other universities such as Columbia, Yale, Stanford and UCLA to maintain more accurate reviews of professors. The Gould School of Law also currently provides a course evaluation of professors available to students.
The resolution, if passed, will be presented to USG President Trenton Stone, who will sign it and then deliver it to various members of the administration for assessment and future implementation.

Journalists Tammy Haddad, Ron Brownstein and Colleen King spoke about media coverage and the role of journalists in the 2020 elections at Ground Zero Tuesday.
Center for the Political Future Director Bob Shrum introduced each of the panelists and Annenberg Media Center Director Christina Bellantoni moderated the discussion. The event was co-hosted by the Center for the Political Future and the Department of Political Science and International Relations as part of the Center’s “Political Conversations” series.
Haddad is the President and CEO of Haddad Media, and formerly served as an executive producer at MSNBC, the Today Show and The Late Late Show. Brownstein is a senior editor at The Atlantic and a senior political analyst at CNN. King is an executive producer at MSNBC.
Bellantoni opened the discussion by asking the panel how media coverage has shaped political discourse since the Democratic Debates on Sept. 12. Haddad and King, who have worked together in producing broadcast television, concurred that editorial choices and the immediacy of media today shape audience’s views about certain candidates and platforms.
“There is a real schism in the reaction to [the debates], based on when the reactions were formulated,” Brownstein said. “People often start writing before the end.”
In the case of the most recent debate, the candidates said that Democratic candidate Julián Castro attacked candidate Joe Biden for his age, and because of the coverage of that incident, Biden’s later assent went by unnoticed.
“I also think there’s so much microtargeting going on in the campaigns,” Haddad said. “So if you’re a regular person, a regular viewer and you’re trying to figure out what’s going on — it’s too narrow. It doesn’t work.”
The panel also discussed how the abundance of information has made it harder for people to choose a candidate. 
Haddad took a moment to survey the audience and asking who is settled on a candidate. Only one hand was raised. The conversation then shifted to how candidates are covered and how this affects voting attitudes.
“In Washington, if you’ve covered foreign policy, or you’ve covered Capitol Hill or you’ve covered the White House, you’ve come across Biden,” King said. “He is very accessible and very friendly, so I think we’ve all met him and know him. But I think, at the same time, you look at him more closely because you remember more than you would know about a newer, up-and-coming candidate.”
The panelists discussed how Elizabeth Warren has emerged as  popular candidate among young, college-educated voters and how some voices speculate that Hillary Clinton might make an appearance at the Democratic National Convention and announce a run for the presidency.
The panelists all agreed that media coverage is so much more abundant and accessible today, and this has changed how voters make their decisions, when they make their decisions and how it affects the length of the entire presidential election process.
“Because there is more money available — it’s essentially infinite — and because there’s more media attention available — it’s essentially infinite — we are seeing races go all the way to the end, in a way that was not common before,” Brownstein said.
Julianna Montano, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and law, has attended several of the Center’s events and found this panel to be different but equally engaging.
 “It was definitely a much different experience because it was an open forum, there was a moderator,” Montano said. “You have less chances to be part of the dialogue, however, I feel that it is such an organized event, it leaves you more room to listen and enjoy learning from professionals in their respective fields.”

To everyone he meets on the street, he is Warren Hastings, a senior from southeastern Virginia majoring in music industry. But, as soon as he steps onto the stage or into the studio, he is “wren.” 
Wren is different from Warren Hastings — it’s him doing the thing he loves. Wren is a musician performing shows at USC and in the L.A. area. When he performs, he does so as a drag queen or a musician. 
“Wren kind of feels like it’s me, but it’s me fully realized, I guess,” wren said. “And it’s like music, drag, whatever — it’s all the same person. Because I don’t want to be bound by gender. I don’t want to be bound by sexuality … I really don’t like feeling tied down to one idea of who I could be because I don’t ever feel like one thing.”
As a queer artist, wren’s identity plays a major role in the music he makes. And that often means being open and honest about his life. His latest single, “Boys Know Boys Best,” was inspired by sexual encounters he has had during the past few years. However, he also hopes that his music is not labeled as solely for queer people, since not all of his songs focus on his queer identity. 
“I think a struggle is feeling like people won’t think you can make music that they’ll like because they’re not queer,” wren said. “I want to make stuff that isn’t just about being gay.” 
Wren’s ultimate musical goal is simple: to make those who listen to it feel good and ready to dance. 
“I want people to feel like they can be themselves,” wren said. “And it’s not like you can be yourself by doing this, it’s the mentality of being yourself [that] is hopefully in the lyrics that I’m writing.”
Before coming to college, wren sang in a church choir where he honed his musical skills. However, wren never had the time nor the financial safety net to dedicate himself solely to his craft. The Thornton School of Music provided the first strict discipline he had ever received in music. Receiving the Norman Topping Scholarship, which recognizes low-income first-generation college students at USC, has provided him with a financial safety net, permitting him to explore music-making further.
“What [USC] has done for me has given me the financial freedom to stop worrying about how I’m gonna pay for all of the bills or being stressed about that all the time,” wren said. “When you go from having to survive your whole life to like, now you get to live, it’s such a different experience day-to-day in my opinion.”
Although he received formal music instruction, wren understood what he was lacking in as a budding artist in the music industry: He could sing, but he wasn’t a producer. So, he became one himself. 
“I became a producer because I was sick of wanting to work on music and not being able to without needing someone else,” wren said. “So I was like, I just have to buckle down, be willing to suck for a little bit, if this is really what I’m supposed to do I’ll get better at it.”
Sloan Pecchia, a senior majoring in music industry, has watched wren’s entire growth as an artist. She witnessed the transformation of his style of music from ballad-like, singer/songwriter tunes to more fully produced songs. She witnessed the transformation of his aesthetic. She watched as his name changed from Linnel to wren. What Pecchia admires the most about wren is his tenacity. 
“He’s always going,” Pecchia said. “And it’s really inspiring because as a musician myself, it’s really hard sometimes and you can get really bogged down, like, ‘Nothing’s happening, nothing’s working, why am I even doing this?’ But he’s always just like going for it all the time.” 
Drag has also impacted the way wren views the world and his gender identity. He began watching RuPaul’s Drag Race, a reality show that follows RuPaul’s search for America’s next drag queen hit, during his sophomore year. 
“When I finally started watching it, it was deconstructing my idea of what I thought a woman was, simultaneously as it was deconstructing what I thought it was to be a man,” wren said. “It’s … repeated validation that you don’t have to be strictly one thing.”
No matter where wren’s professional career takes him, he knows that creating music will be a constant in his life because he loves it. In addition to releasing new music soon, wren will perform in USC’s Drag Show in November, a free event hosted by the Queer & Ally Student Assembly.

Throughout middle and high school, I attended Oxford Academy, the No. 10 public school in the nation (the ranking has since dropped to 19). To maintain our reputation as an academically rigorous institution, we were discouraged from engaging in frivolous pursuits like football games, home economics and dressing ourselves. Our school uniforms consisted of white polos and khaki slacks; shoes and sweaters were gray or white. After graduation, I cleaned out my closet and counted how many shapeless, baggy gray sweaters I’d accumulated: 12 in total. 
There was one thing, however, that the administration couldn’t regulate: socks. Not that they didn’t try — the official dress code stated that socks were supposed to be white, ribbed and above the ankle. But since I mostly wore long pants, my socks were concealed, and demanding students hike up their pant legs for surprise sock inspections was a tad excessive, even for Oxford. 
As a sophomore in high school, Tumblr was my go-to platform — I was trying the “art hoe” persona on for size. I stumbled across a post on my timeline that advertised cool socks printed with famous paintings — Gustav Klimt’s “The Kiss,” Vincent Van Gogh’s “Starry Night,” Edvard Munch’s “The Scream.” The Sock Drawer, a novelty sock boutique, was running a limited time offer that bundled them together for $20. I bought them.
And then I just … kept on buying. I bought more art prints — Edgar Degas’ ballerinas, Leonardo da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa,” Sandro Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus.” Then I expanded to whatever kooky patterns caught my eye — cats, succulents, mermaids, ice cream. I bought holiday socks for Valentine’s Day, Fourth of July and Halloween. I bought so many socks from The Sock Drawer that it once sent me a free pair as a thank you for my purchases. My friends never asked what I wanted for my birthday or Secret Santa. They already knew to get me socks. 
I devoted my Instagram to showcasing my collection, which grew astronomically. Every day I wore a different pair to school, exposing a forbidden sliver of pink or yellow between my khakis and my Keds. 
I’m not the only one drawn to the low-key fashion statement. Politicians especially seem to love “sock diplomacy;” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is a particularly conspicuous proponent of them, and former President George H.W. Bush’s wacky sock affinity was so well-known that when he died, people paid homage with the hashtag #SocksForBush. Dudes from Silicon Valley to Wall Street rock them too, whether paired with jeans and a hoodie or a three-piece suit. 
So what do white-collar workers, high-profile politicians and my high school self have in common? We’re all surrounded by homogenizing, soul-sucking environments that attempt to repress individuality and censor self-expression. When everyone is expected to dress (and act) as boring as possible, when all your peers are blank-eyed and spout meaningless drivel like “Let’s touch base” or “Thoughts and prayers” or “I have a perfect superscore on the SAT,” the urge to rebel can become overwhelming. But of course, fighting back comes with consequences, so the only way you can resist is through something extremely low-stakes and lily-livered, like a pair of pizza-themed socks. 
By the time I graduated high school, I had more than 70 pairs of socks and a fun fact about me on hand for every first-day-of-class icebreaker. But then something strange happened. My steady stream of socks slowed to a trickle. I started to spend more time browsing for clothes, cultivating my personal style and building a new closet from scratch. I haven’t purchased a new pair in over two years.
My sartorial freedom in college means my extensive sock collection has lost its purpose, languishing in my bottom dresser drawer. But there’s hope for it yet. In a year, I’m going to graduate and (fingers crossed) find a job that, presumably, enforces a workplace-appropriate dress code. My work wardrobe will consist of button-down blouses, pressed pants and, of course, some fun patterned socks.
