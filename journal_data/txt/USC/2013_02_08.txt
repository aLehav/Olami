In the words of USC coach Bob Cantu, the Trojans “stayed the course.”
After an offensive vacuum sucked up both teams’ productivity midway through the second half, the Trojans (10-13, 5-5 in Pac-12 play) capitalized on their opportunities down the stretch and hit a wave of late free throws to pull away for a 72-68 home win over the Washington State Cougars (11-12, 2-8).
USC trailed by seven early in the second half, but the Trojans managed to square the game at 53 with 5:37 to go, and then went on a decisive 9-1 run to pull out to a 62-54 lead with under three minutes to go. The frenetic Cougars hit a whirlwind of 3-pointers to cut the deficit to two with six seconds left but were unable to claw all the way back.
The Trojans improve to 3-3 under Cantu, and are now in a five-way tie for fifth place in the Pac-12 conference standings with a conference record of 5-5.
A week after scoring four clutch overtime points in USC’s 75-71 over UCLA, sophomore guard Byron Wesley led the Trojans with a season-high 20 points on 7-of-10 shooting, including eight of USC’s first 10 points.
“Byron is a slasher; he’s a scorer and he can get to the basket,” Cantu said. “He’s almost like a running back in there, you get him the ball and he can find holes in the zone and make plays.”
Senior point guard Jio Fontan tied a career high with 11 assists to go along with 10 points, despite not practicing all week while dealing with the flu. Junior guard J.T. Terrell pitched in 12 points, all in the second half, while junior forward Ari Stewart contributed a season-high 11 off the bench in a balanced Trojan scoring effort. Redshirt junior forward Dewayne Dedmon led the Trojans with 11 rebounds, as USC outrebounded the Cougars 38-28.
USC had an eight-day layoff following the UCLA game and broke out with a burst of energy as the sides traded baskets early. After Washington State tied the game at 14 with 12:53 left in the first half, the Trojans reeled off seven straight points, including five from bench sub Stewart, to go ahead at 21-14.
“We gave them (the team) a couple of days off over the weekend, and then we said ‘Hey guys, you got to take care of business this next game or else that game (UCLA) is not going to mean anything,’” Cantu said.
The Cougars found their shooting touch soon after, though. After not scoring for the first 13 minutes, forward Brock Motum had a scoring burst of six points in two minutes, as the Cougars went on an 11-3 run to take a 25-24 lead with 5:05 left in the opening half. The Trojans clawed back to take the lead again, but consecutive 3-pointers by guard DaVonte Lacy put USC in a 33-30 hole at halftime.
The Trojans quickly erased their deficit to begin the second half to make it 34-33, but the Trojan defense could not muster enough pressure, as the Cougars followed with an 8-0 run to take a 41-34 lead, their largest of the game.
A slew of offensive fouls and turnovers hurt the Trojans, but the Cougars topped them in sloppy play by going over six minutes without even making a field goal. With the Cougars throwing up bricks, back-to-back 3-pointers from Terrell gave USC its first lead of the second half at 49-47 with 7:51 to go. Still in the game by this point, USC managed to score efficiently down the stretch, going 17-for-18 on free throws in the second half to hold off the Cougars.
The Trojans host the Washington Huskies on Sunday at 7 p.m.

The Kappa Sigma fraternity at Duke University threw an “Asia Prime” party on February 1, resulting in their suspension by the school. Prior to the party, Duke’s Asian American Alliance brought up complaints, leading to the party being renamed (instead of being cancelled altogether) to “International Relations.”
Yahoo! News posted a picture of the e-mail invitation that was sent out, which included a picture of Kim-Jong Il from Team America: World Police and misspellings intended to imitate Asian accents such as “Herro” and “Chank you.”
First of all, a party where everyone dresses Asian? As a Taiwanese-American, I personally don’t understand the intrigue to dressing up in staunch white makeup and unflattering baggy smocks. I also bet people were having a difficult time with the chopsticks they must’ve had to eat with.
If anything, people are coming to a frat party to rage! So wouldn’t one want to be comfortable, perhaps wear something a little showy – an “Italian” themed party would’ve been more appropriate for the occasion (I’ve been waiting to bust out my Pauly D hair wig).
All jokes aside, the real issue here is how Duke allowed the fraternity to throw the racially heated party, even after receiving numerous complaints. Don’t tell me that they really bought the facade of renaming the party to “International Relations.” College students need to check themselves before they engage in potentially offensive and discriminatory behavior and school administrations need to strongly enforce and facilitate this check.
At Pike we love all the hotties of the World.   No sense in just tapping local talent.  “Different” is the key!
You say that an asian themed party is highly offensive, then go on to say that an Italian themed party is appropriate? Sounds pretty hypocritical to me.
It is fine to criticize the Kappa Sigma fraternity, expose their offensive behavior, and encourage students to stop and think before participating. I think they are disgusting. But demanding a prohibition on their party goes against the freedoms of speech and association protected by the First Amendment. You forget that you do not have a right to never feel offended. If overly-sensitive people got to dictate what was bias/discrimination, almost every political event and party would be shut down.
Also, your usage of “discrimination” is faulty (racially heated is a better term). For discrimination to occur, certain guests at the party would have to be treated in a fundamentally different way from the other attendees based on their race, religion, gender, etc. There would need to be some unfair rule in effect (e.g. only Asians would be served drinks at the party). Merely playing dress-up does not discriminate against anyone.
One commenter below is correct that Duke is a private institution, allowed to make its own rules. But not in California (or the real world outside of academia, I might add). So Katie, I recommend reviewing the California Leonard Law, which compels even private universities here to abide by the First Amendment. Most of the so-called harassment/bias clauses in student handbooks (which are far more sweeping than actual criminal harassment laws and establish guilt based on who decides to feel offended) are probably illegal to enforce.
You never see Caucasian portion of the student body protesting a redneck themed party…Seriously we’re all at USC and smart enough to know that a theme means literally nothing for the party. Relax.
Freedom of speech. (Not by law, since Duke is private, but in principle.) If I want to throw a party, I should be able to theme it however I choose.
