In light of the sports shutdown of the last few weeks, the world of athletics has once again shown how it is both connected to our larger society as a whole and acts as a microcosm of it. As low-income workers struggle with the transition to working at home, employees who fill similar roles in sports are concurrently suffering through tough times, and it’s only going to get worse as the state of emergency escalates.
Now, think about all of the so-called “unskilled” labor that goes into making our sports landscape possible: ushers and vendors who allow games to happen, maintenance workers who keep facilities clean and healthy for athletes to work in, security officers who keep team members and fans safe during events. All of these people are out of work right now.
Some sports media members realized shortly after the sports shutdown that these workers will have little to no ability to make ends meet now that their primary revenue stream has gone dry. Accordingly, these people made their voices heard, specifically by calling on team owners to guarantee workers’ pay with the idea that rich ownership could afford to take this step. 
It became a dominant story in a sports media cycle in need of topics to discuss in the absence of games. In the early days of self-quarantine, multiple players such as Kevin Love, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Zion Williamson announced they would donate money to workers in their respective stadiums while owners, with a few exceptions, were slow to make any such promises.
Williamson’s case in particular generated headlines because, up to that point, team ownership hadn’t done anything. (Team owner Gayle Benson has since donated $1 million to a fund that will assist workers at the Pelicans’ Smoothie King Center as well as those impacted by the virus in the greater New Orleans community.)
The situation came to a head when Philadelphia 76ers owner Josh Harris announced a plan to reduce employee salaries by 20% due to financial losses before backtracking and apologizing in the face of massive public backlash.
Sports media, which was already an incredible forum for opinionated commentary when focusing on trivial topics, was the perfect space for this story to play out, and the differing opinions of two of the analysts I respect most made it clear to me that the topic of ownership paying employees isn’t as cut and dry as some might think.
First was Rachel Nichols, host of ESPN’s “The Jump” and someone who I believe sees the world more clearly than just about everyone else. She joined coworker Zach Lowe’s podcast March 19, about a week after the NBA season was suspended, to call out NBA owners for not immediately guaranteeing employees’ salaries and fellow media members for their coverage.
“I was surprised, some of our colleagues who were very quick to defend the NBA owners — ‘Give them a month to get a plan together’ or that kind of thing,’” she said. “When you are a billionaire, literally, and half of NBA owners are billionaires, it is a penny out of your pocket to [commit] … that you’re going to pay out hourly workers for the last 20 games of the season. It is nothing.”
I agree with Nichols that it should be a no-brainer for owners to cover their employees’ salaries; as she said, it’s not really a huge hit for most of them, even considering that they’re losing money right now. But the Ringer’s Ryen Russillo, another person that I respect for taking a fair viewpoint of things (even when his opinions might not be popularly accepted) brought up the fact that the coronavirus is an extraordinary problem and that it’s hard to blame owners for not acting immediately when they have no warning and no precedent to work with.
“I said it immediately, I’m like ‘Man, is there any way we can give these guys more than a day?’” Russillo said on a March 16 episode of the Bill Simmons podcast. “And guess what? Almost everybody is stepping up … So far it seems like everybody’s going to be taken care of.”
When two people as smart as Nichols and Russillo disagree so vehemently, that tells me we’re working with a complicated situation. I think they’re both right; it’s very easy for owners to cover their employees’ pay, but I’d expect them to think everything through and come up with a well-thought-out plan before promising anything (although this doesn’t apply to the 76ers, who made a stupid, premature announcement and then went back on it because they were getting ripped to shreds).
It’s important to remember that we’re dealing with something the likes of which hasn’t been seen since the 1918 flu pandemic. Even the people in charge have no idea what they’re dealing with because it seems to change every day. 
That doesn’t excuse the actions of those who downplayed the outbreak, consistently made wrong decisions, racialized the pandemic’s name and tried to use it to get themselves re-elected (guess who that’s referring to); but what it does mean is that we have to find a way to continue holding people accountable without holding them to an impossible standard.

When Ethan Bresnick, a junior majoring in media arts and practice, was brainstorming ideas for a class project on human interaction via computer interface, he decided to pull inspiration from the close family relationships he had as a child. Using his experience as a frame of reference, he created a piece of technology that would enable old and young family members separated by geography and busy schedules to spend quality time with one another. 
“One of the greatest concerns that I have for the next generation is losing touch with their family history,” Bresnick said. “When I was a kid, I lived very close to my grandparents, and I was fortunate that they were able to share their imagination with me and able to play with me.” 
AR Playdates, an augmented reality playing platform, helps family members, such as grandparents and their grandchildren, to play together regardless of physical distance. 
In January, Bresnick began collaborating with JD LeRoy, a junior in the Iovine and Young Academy, for the final project in “Tangible and Spatial Computing,” a course that explores human interaction through virtual screen interfaces. John Carpenter, an adjunct associate professor in the School of Cinematic Arts, taught the class with the goal of teaching students how to use camera and sensor technology as a medium for their design work. 
“The goal of the program is to teach students to work with technology in interesting new ways,” Carpenter said. “The class typically involves looking at a number of different technologies and writing software and combining that with sensing technologies like cameras or 3D sensors.” 
Bresnick’s device, which resembles a coffee table, combines live video streaming, virtual graphics and depth sensors, creating a simulation between users that makes it seem as if they are interacting with each other in the same room, even if they are located miles apart.
The device captures users’ hands and toys on the panel surface that streams the image to another table in a separate location for both people to see what the other is doing. Following the course objective, Bresnick aimed to create a project that would center around utilizing camera sensor technology. 
“I was looking at how the data from the depth camera and the color camera on the play surface could be used as the user interface for creating these augmented reality effects in the background,” Bresnick said.
LeRoy said he was inspired by the vision and dedication Bresnick had for the project beyond seeing it as a normal class assignment. The product had the potential to change the toy industry by integrating more personal interactions with technology, he said. 
“There’s a lack of product on the market that enables playing creatively … especially in the telepresence industry,” LeRoy said.  “I think this kind of product … will make toy companies and other devices think more about what kinds of impact they can have and what kinds of interactions they can enable through the technology.” 
While Bresnick focused on software, LeRoy worked on hardware design given his experience in designing shoes for Adidas. 
“I was really interested in working with someone that has a really strong sense of natural forms … working with wood and materials that children are comfortable playing with so that this technology wouldn’t intrude or hinder the kinds of playing that children already do,” Bresnick said.
Currently, AR Playdates is not manufacturing the prototype for sale, but the team is recording the progress of the entire project to share with professionals in the toy industry since March. 
“With this project, specifically, [Bresnick] and I are reaching out to different manufacturers and different technology and toy companies to see if we [could] potentially work on some kind of partnership,” LeRoy said.
Bresnick credits USC for providing mentorship and advice throughout the process, specifically on designing and refining the software program 
“A lot of our faculty have been really involved in the development of technologies and augmented reality and virtual reality,” Bresnick said. “I was able to receive a lot of mentorship [on] what’s out there in telepresence products today and what considerations that have to be made in designing software for a telepresence augmented reality system.”
For Carpenter, the project is especially relevant to the current coronavirus crisis, with many states putting in place a stay-at-home order, since it will create an opportunity for families to build connections with one another when it would otherwise be impossible. 
“[They] took some of the ideas we talked about in class and figured out some interesting new way to apply it to an idea that’s really important for our community right now,” Carpenter said. “It’s especially relevant right now where we were all under social distancing, so finding plenty of interesting new ways to interact with other people and share experiences … is a great endeavour.”   
Optimistic in the progress of the product, LeRoy said he is confident in the potential of AR Playdates and its contribution to the toy and technology industry. 
“Everything is open right now and we’re not really certain, but we’re definitely open to continuing this project, or developing some kind of different mock up of it,” LeRoy said.

Researchers in the Department of Computer Science studied interactions between socially assistive robots and children with autism in a monthlong in-home study to explore how robots benefit the children’s engagement and learning. 
Gisele Ragusa, a Viterbi professor and co-principal investigator on the project, said researchers designed Kiwi, the robot, to be warm and fuzzy but durable. They did not want a robot that made a lot of noise because many children with autism spectrum disorder have trouble handling too many stimuli at once. Kiwi is gender-neutral, since researchers wanted to ensure that the children could decide for themselves and identify with the robots’ genders. 
“I was that person who was involved with every single family, start to finish,” Ragusa said. “It was really a great experience for me –– one of the most dramatic research experiences that I’ve ever seen because the children did so well.” 
During the deployments, the children played simple math games on a tablet nearly every day for 30 minutes. Kiwi sat behind the tablet and provided feedback and instruction about the game while recording the interactions.
Shomik Jain, a senior majoring in applied and computational mathematics and pursuing a master’s degree in electrical engineering, said the games adjusted to each child’s learning patterns. For instance, if the child was doing well, the team would present them with a more advanced game. 
“We would love to see socially assistive robots deployed in the homes of children with autism, especially to augment therapists when they may not be available or affordable all the time,” said Jain, a lead author on the project. “It’s really important to analyze studies in these real-world environments.”
Following the deployments, Jain looked at each child’s disengagement and decided whether it could be modeled by using data that the team collected, including the child’s visual focus of attention and audio data. 
“We wanted to model the child’s behavior to see if we could create smarter, more intelligent robots,” Jain said. “We want the robot to be able to recognize and respond to changes in emotion and behavior, such as if the child becomes disengaged.”
According to Ragusa, parents told researchers that over time, their interactions with their children increased as the children developed a relationship with Kiwi. Maja Mataric is a lead investigator on the project and has worked with deploying robots into the homes of 17 children between the ages 3 and 8 with mild autism from late 2017 to 2019. Mataric has also been involved in research focused on finding ways for robots to help children with autism and other people with neurological conditions.
“In this era of concerns about [artificial intelligence] and robotics taking people’s jobs away, it is important for people to see various ways in which technology can do good,” Matarić wrote in an email. “Socially assistive robotics is a great area for doing good for humanity; it is also a great area for engaging typically underrepresented groups in computing and engineering.”
Ragusa said she believes socially assistive robots are a perfect match for children with autism spectrum disorder. 
“Autism is a mysterious challenge,” Ragusa said. “We know far less about autism spectrum disorder than we do other learning-related disabilities or other challenges, so the need was great. We were using something that was socially assistive by definition, since individuals with autism spectrum disorder primarily have social challenges.”
According to Jain, the socially assistive robots are not intended to replace human therapists but rather to augment or supplement them. 
The study was funded by a five-year National Science Foundation grant awarded to a collaborative team from USC and other universities, including MIT, Yale and Stanford. The grant was designated for research to develop socially assistive robots for children. 
“I think when you think of an issue, such as the social development of kids with autism spectrum disorders, your first thought isn’t, ‘Let’s give them a robot to interact with,’” said Roxanna Pakkar, a research assistant on the project and senior majoring in electrical engineering. “It’s cool that the engineers in our labs and the psychologists that we work with and educators that we work with were able to come together and develop this solution.”

The double-feature is a practice long abandoned by movie theaters. Only repertory venues — The New Beverly, the Aero Theatre, the Egyptian — still regularly program two films back to back. While the two features are usually connected through a shared actor, writer or director, I find the most fun pairings are films that are thematically linked — and the more obscure that link, the better. 
As we continue to self-quarantine and eventually finish the semester at home, I suggest we take up the double-feature tradition to pass some of the time. I’ve thematically paired a number of films below and most of them can be found on streaming platforms. If you can, watch them in the order they are listed. I hope I’ve chosen correctly so the first film will ease you into the second. That’s the best thing about double-features, they always open the door to something new. 
Double feature No. 1: Modern romance (is weird) 
‘Punch-Drunk Love’ (2002) and ‘A Woman is a Woman’ (1961) 
Blue suits and bright colors aren’t the only things these two romantic comedies have in common. Both Paul Thomas Anderson’s “Punch-Drunk Love” and Jean-Luc Godard’s “A Woman is a Woman” play with rom-com and musical genre tropes — Anderson mainly with his characters and Godard with his camera. Both films are swift and fun, with their disorienting plots rarely predictable and their peculiar characters delightfully undefinable. 
Double feature No. 2: Tales from the inside
‘Goodfellas’ (1990) and ‘City of God’ (2002)
I recently saw “City of God” for the first time, and I was immediately reminded of “Goodfellas” — the visual pauses, the accompanying narration, the gruesome violence and the decade-spanning plots based on real events. These two crime thrillers will take you inside ugly worlds for a couple of hours, and while that may sound disturbing, you eventually find yourself totally invested in the plot and actually concerned for the cast of heinous (and weirdly nicknamed) characters. 
Double feature No. 3: Come inside 
‘Annihilation’ (2018) and ‘Pan’s Labyrinth’ (2006)
For most of “Annihilation,” there’s a clear border between fantasy and reality, but that’s never the case in “Pan’s Labyrinth.” The former, Alex Garland’s underrated sci-fi flick, follows a team of scientists investigating a strange territory that seems to have sprouted from an asteroid smashing into the earth — “The Shimmer,” they call it. Guillermo del Toro’s melancholy fantasy, however, always keeps us guessing whether the “fantasy” is actually real. In it, del Toro doesn’t patronize his child protagonist but gracefully invites us to see things the way she does.  
Double feature No. 4: Most misunderstood
‘Frances Ha’ (2012) and ‘Thunder Road’ (2018)
“Girlfriends” (1978) would probably be a more logical pairing with “Frances Ha;” although female friendship does play a crucial role in Noah Baumbach’s movie, I wanted to link it to a film with a similar protagonist. While Jim Arnaud (Jim Cummings) from “Thunder Road” is by no means as talented as Frances (Greta Gerwig) (as the first 12 minutes of the movie will show), what these two share is ambition, self-confidence, joy and a real love for someone else. In “Frances Ha” that’s love for friends, and in “Thunder Road” it’s love for a daughter. Although both Frances and Jim like to ramble and show off, the former qualities are much more important than any singular talent. 
Double feature No. 5: The kids are alright
‘The Florida Project’ (2017) and ‘The 400 Blows’ (1959)
Sean Baker’s “The Florida Project” follows a band of 6-year-old misanthropes whose adventures are not quite like other children’s; they live in cheap motels in Orlando, only a few miles from Walt Disney World. Like Baker’s movie, François Truffaut’s “The 400 Blows” is essentially a series of elementary school antics. The beauty here is how both films force us to spend time with human beings we would probably overlook. Clearly, Baker and Truffaut create from personal experience — the kids are the most genuine part of their films, and both directors happily let them run loose.
Double feature No. 6: Upstairs/downstairs
‘Parasite’ (2019) and ‘Us’ (2019)
Immediately after watching “Parasite,” I remembered “Us” — Jordan Peele’s sophomore feature that’s also about an upstairs-downstairs dynamic and the “haves” vs. the “have-nots.” These weren’t the only two movies concerned with social class and upward mobility in 2019; I’ll include here “Knives Out” (whose final shot is a flipped upstairs-downstairs moment), “The Last Black Man in San Francisco,” “Ready or Not” and even “Joker.” Clearly, these social issues are very prominent in the minds of our contemporary filmmakers, so now it’s just up to us to pay attention.
Double feature No. 7: Messing with the medium
‘Scott Pilgrim vs. The World’ (2010) and ‘8 ½’ (1963)
Forty-seven years apart, “Scott Pilgrim vs. The World” and “8 ½” are not that different. Yes, the former is a fast-paced, quirky video-game comedy and the latter is one of the best movies about making movies. Still, both films play around with what’s real and what’s just in the mind of their protagonist. “8 ½” is a bit more baffling and niche, so maybe “Scott Pilgrim” won’t totally prepare you for it. Either way, if someone out there actually listens to me and watches both of these movies back to back, I will be both thankful and surprised that you took my advice.

Elizabeth Tapia’s schedule has been upended since moving back to San Jose to start online classes.
While the junior, who is majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, no longer has to attend club meetings or work her on-campus job, she must now balance studying for chemistry and statistics with proofreading essays for her younger brother, tutoring and grabbing groceries. 
She spends about three hours every day helping her family with different tasks and sometimes doesn’t start her assignments until 10 p.m. On top of that, during classes she has to message friends for help when her Wi-Fi cuts out or Zoom drains the battery from her laptop.
Her professors have shown a range of approaches when handling the transition to online courses and adjusting to students’ needs. Tapia’s chemistry professor hasn’t changed his syllabus, while her Spanish instructor made classes and the final paper optional in case students can’t participate. 
“It takes off a lot of the burden on students being really worried if they’ll still be able to get a good grade in their classes,” she said.
Growing up, Tapia said her parents often looked to her as an extra caregiver for her brother and someone to help around the house, partly because she was the oldest of the two siblings. She’s now dealing with those same responsibilities while shouldering a much heavier course load. 
For Tapia, some of this responsibility comes with age, but women across the country are dealing with extra burdens as they’re expected to work from home while also taking care of children who need to be homeschooled. And for students whose parents work essential jobs and can’t be home, the responsibility may be placed on them to care for younger siblings and older relatives, while they also try to listen to lectures, write papers and take exams. 
The coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated a problem women know too well; even in a purported age of feminism, we’re often expected to carry most of the weight when it comes to child care and household chores with little credit. A 2020 Gallup survey found that straight couples aged 18 to 34 and their older counterparts were just as likely to leave cleaning, cooking and washing clothes to women. 
Universities’ handling of the coronavirus has also further emphasized how institutions often ignore the needs of first-generation and low-income students. At Harvard University, students were told March 10 they had five days to leave their dorms, even though not all students could afford to make last-minute travel arrangements. Arizona State University president Michael Crow told The Arizona Republic that considering housing refunds was at the bottom of his to-do list, even though that money could help students pay for necessary expenses.
USC and other institutions have tried to alleviate some of these issues by allowing students who can’t easily come home to stay in university housing, giving prorated refunds on room and board fees and extending the pass/fail option to all courses to help students who will face issues attending classes. 
But the burden also falls on instructors to better accommodate students who have to take on extra responsibilities at home or work more jobs to help pay the bills. Meika Loe and her colleague Nimanthi Rajasingham, both women’s studies professors at Colgate University, will hold optional synchronous class and revamp their syllabi to include assignments meant to alleviate their students’ anxieties. 
“As far as I’m concerned, everyone can get an A, and I’m not interested in testing,” Rajasingham said. “But I think this is the moment where we think about what we can learn together.”
Once Trousdale Parkway is again (hopefully) bustling with students in the fall, professors must realize that the circumstances students face at home during the pandemic may be similar when they’re on campus. 
At every university, there are students who try to balance multiple campus jobs to make ends meet, help care for relatives or deal with mental health issues while taking a full course load. Administrators and professors aren’t going to know every student’s circumstances, but they can learn from this moment to be more lenient with assignments, attendance and grading and to extend that generosity when students return to campus. 
That way, students who need to can focus more on taking care of themselves and their loved ones rather than stressing over letters on a transcript. And for those who argue that a more forgiving teaching style encourages laziness, take these examples. 
For Tapia’s Spanish class, she doesn’t need to attend Zoom classes or turn in a final paper, but she plans on showing up and doing the work every time because she enjoys the course.
And in 2001, when Loe taught at UC Santa Barbara, she was shocked when everyone came to class several hours after terrorists hit the Twin Towers to be a support system for one another. Ever since, she’s changed her approach to be more flexible with students.
“In all institutions, the more we can humanize and understand who we’re working with and what their resources are and what their challenges are, we can do a better job as educators,” she said. “This is the care ethic that we’ve lost in a world that promotes masculinism.”

Memphis-style barbecue and wines ranging from Napa Valley to Sicily aren’t the only things at odds with each other in Netflix’s latest film “Uncorked.” Writer and director Prentice Penny (“Insecure,” “Brooklyn Nine-Nine”), in his feature film debut, captures the struggle between father and son in a generational conflict between keeping tradition alive and pursuing individual passions.
Elijah (Mamoudou Athie) works two jobs: one at his family’s long-standing barbecue restaurant and the other at a local winery. His father Louis (Courtney B. Vance) wants Elijah to eventually take over the restaurant to keep the family business alive. There’s just one slight problem: Elijah isn’t interested in spending the rest of his life buying hickory wood and cutting up ribs. What he wants is to become a master sommelier. 
The joy that exudes from Elijah’s face is apparent every time he drinks a glass of pinot grigio, a Riesling or any other wine. From the moment he tastes the drink, he’s able to decipher the region it came from and the year the grapes were plucked. It’s a passion that he knows is hard for his family, especially his father, to understand. But it’s a love nonetheless that equals the one his father has for the restaurant.
When he finally garners the courage to tell his entire family, they look perplexed. The term sommelier is foreign to them, especially to his mother Sylvia (Niecy Nash), who mistakenly says “Somalian” and “sommely” instead.	
Dinner scenes between the family as well as Syliva and Louis’ banter are where the dialogue excels, playing out more like improvisation in the film’s funniest moments. But Penny’s screenplay manages to tread between balancing comedic bursts with quiet moments of family drama.
Although the film’s writing is strong, Penny does fall into the same faults that first-time directors typically make. At a 104-minute runtime, the film drags with an unnecessary amount of transition shots. Not only that, but an overabundance of song choices makes the film feel like it wants to blare whatever single is currently popular for no reason. Luckily, these are single issues that don’t hinder the plot.
Penny never devolves scenes into melodramatic sequences of excessive anger. Most of the time, conversations are restrained, with the camera lingering on people holding back what they want to say. Louis and Elijah, in particular, can’t manage to hold a conversation that lasts more than a few minutes without having to pretend like they’re semi-interested. The room turns quiet — both have something on their mind, but they stop themselves, opting to say nothing instead.   
Elijah is naturally goofy and as a pickup line compares Riesling, a sweet white wine, to Drake because they’re both “in their feelings.” He’s corny but the likable type. His smile lingers on for too long, unsure of what to do or say next. But where he resembles his father most is in his inability to voice his thoughts in times of conflict. Athie and Vance’s father-son performances shine at depicting the stubbornness of men, who instead of giving in to their emotions, repress them instead.
The more time Elijah devotes to studying theory and wine tasting, the more the unspoken tension between him and his father evolve. That’s when Nash comes in as the caring mother who tells it like it is. Her performance becomes more engrossing and emotionally impactful as she sees the relationship between her husband and son falter. She, along with Elijah’s motivating girlfriend Tanya (Sasha Compere), are the beacons of rationale in “Uncorked.” They aren’t afraid to push their partners to confront their feelings head-on even when it’s uncomfortable.
Their words can only go so far, as both Louis and Elijah do what they know best and focus on barbecuing and wine tasting. What follows are scenes detailing their respective crafts. Sommeliers deciphering that the red wine they’re drinking is a 2006 Alta Vista Single Vineyard Temis or chefs cutting up and smothering ribs with homemade barbecue sauce play out like scenes from “Chef’s Table.” Cinematographer Elliot Davis shoots these scenes extremely up close, capturing the marbling of raw meat and the pouring of wine into a glass. He’s able to highlight the level of precision that it takes to succeed in these respective fields.
“Uncorked” blends comedy and drama in a film that champions people doing what they love and delving into why they love it. The true contrast in the movie isn’t just between wine and barbecue but between father and son.

USC’s 2020 Sustainability Plan set admirable campus goals: reduce greenhouse gases by 20% per square foot and achieve 75% waste diversion levels. Another key aspect is encouraging interdepartmental cooperation. One goal this year was to have 75% of USC schools and offices engaged in responsible purchasing practices. Within this category is an interesting subset: the goal to purchase 20% of food from sustainable sources. In citing examples of sustainable food practices, the University states its hope of buying locally grown, farm-fresh food that upholds nutritional standards. 
USC has scaled up efforts to embrace the use of locally grown food products through events like the weekly Trojans Farmers Market at McCarthy Quad, but to develop truly local, versatile food sources, the University should consider opening a free, on-campus community garden. 
USC does host a few gardens on or near campus. There’s the experimental aeroponics garden across the street at USC Hotel, used by chefs at Morton Fig, McKay’s and The Lab, who use the garden’s fresh produce in seasonal dishes. There’s also the tiny garden nestled near the Parkside dining hall, accessible to members of the Garden Club. Shrine Place has an urban garden open to students, faculty, staff and community members in the yard of a USC-owned house. 
Despite the existence of these three gardens and the myriad positive resources they offer, there remains a need for a central, community-based garden for all students. A centralized garden could serve a wide array of purposes, beyond simply acting as teaching tools in academic settings. From directly supplementing food for dining halls and campus events to providing spaces of gratitude, connection and purpose, gardens have much to offer. 
In Washington, D.C., students at George Washington University have reaped all these benefits. Their small garden is like another world, just one half-block of space within their urban campus. Among their rows of vegetables, student volunteers find comfort in working together to support the garden. Students come to the garden to establish a connection with the land but end up learning far more about urban farming and each other. Some even find a community of relationships that lasts all four years.
Even more impressive, none of the crops go to waste. Some are used to supplement on-campus dining halls and farmers markets, but the majority are donated to local food banks or organizations that support D.C.’s homeless population. Every week, students harvest pounds of produce that is delivered directly to groups such as Miriam’s Kitchen, a nonprofit that feeds around 300 people experiencing homelessness a day. The garden is also used to provide fresh fruit and vegetables for the campus food pantry. 
Like GWU, USC is an urban campus with many similar programs in place. Opening a garden is the logical next step in contributing food to the surrounding community. The University has already ramped up efforts to address community shortages during the coronavirus outbreak. In an email last week, President Carol Folt described USC programs that are currently donating fresh food and produce to local food drives and, most notably, serving 400 meals a day to students in the Head Start Program. 
In the future, a garden could continue these initiatives through similar donations to food banks and regional organizations. It could also add fresh produce to the Trojan Food Bank, a service open to any student experiencing food scarcity. With an accessible on-campus location, students and dining halls could even provide the compost. Increasing the University’s local food supply will definitely require more than the gardens USC currently has.
Studies show that campus gardens offer more advantages than just the crops they yield. The cooperation and synergy inherent in caring for a garden is the ideal conduit for interdepartmental collaboration, one of the goals in USC’s 2020 Sustainability Plan. Opening a communal space encourages students from all departments to have a vested interest in where their food comes from. 
Living in a city as large as Los Angeles, it is easy to forget that students have control — often more than what is thought — over how and where their food comes from. This matters in times of climate instability. A garden is a great opportunity to care for a small piece of land, learn about its microcosm and understand the power of urban and local farming.  
GWU is only one of the hundreds of universities around the country that have added campus gardens in the last few years. Across town, UCLA’s Jane B. Semel HCI Community Garden boasts 31 beds used for gardening workshops by student organizations and faculty. The garden aims to address food scarcity on campus, as well as promote community building and food system education.  
With a growing need to look locally for our food supply, it’s time to take a note from campus gardens around the country: Let’s grow together.
