The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics brought in panelists to analyze the results of the New Hampshire primaries in real time Tuesday night at Tommy’s Place.
Panelists included Bob Shrum, a professor of political science and Carmen H. and Louis Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics, Henry Olsen, senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, Samantha Archie of the USC College Democrats, and Leesa Danzek of the USC College Republicans. The panel was moderated by Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute, and Jack Walker, news editor for the Daily Trojan.
Sen. Bernie Sanders won the New Hampshire Democratic primary with 59.6 percent of the vote. 58 percent of women voted for Sanders, while Clinton received 41 percent of women. Among young voters aged 18 to 34, Sanders got 87.5 percent of the vote while Clinton got 12 percent.
Shrum said that in order to experience further success in the primaries, both candidates need to be careful about how they present themselves.
“I think the most important case for the Democratic candidates is that we need to watch the speeches they say, whether or not they both give the same kinds of speeches,” Shrum said. “Hillary must give people a vision, articulate what people can relate to, not give a quasi-State of the Union, and not emotionally reach people, while Sanders must lay the groundwork for what the campaign has just said and involve themselves in a truly national campaign.”
Archie added she thought it was interesting to see such a highly contested Democratic primary.
“It’s an interesting night, it’s a different type of race and there is a divide between Democrats right now,” Archie said.
On the Republican side, Donald Trump won the primary with 34.5 percent of the vote, with several other candidates following him closely in the 10-16 percent range.
Olsen said that — despite Trump’s victory — his public persona will make it difficult to gain more support from people who don’t back him already.
“[Trump] is getting difficulty expanding his support because he inspires devotion and loathing in equal numbers, and you always see in the polls that he’s leading in numbers,” Olsen said. “If it was a yes-no for Donald Trump, it would be close to 50-50, and those who do not want to vote for Donald Trump — who tend to be highly educated and more moderate — are trying to settle who is better.”
Overall, Schnur noted that the voter turnout for young voters, especially for Sanders, was historic.
“87 percent of young voters from 18-35 are supporting Sanders,” Schnur said. “I would bet that back in the 2008 campaign, Barack Obama did not gain as much support from African-Americans compared to Sanders’ [support from young people] today.”
William Yelton, a senior majoring in film production, said he’s happy that Sanders won New Hampshire.
“I’m for Bernie Sanders all the way,” Yelton said. “USC has taught me to love people despite their religion, their sexuality, their gender, and both Clinton and Sanders support these people. However, Sanders has been supporting these people since day one.”
Aujenique Washington, a sophomore majoring in political science and an undecided voter, is also now leaning more toward Sanders.
“The part of Bernie’s campaign that intrigues me the most is that he’s very passionate about equality.” Washington said. “The most important part for that is to end institutional racism, even though it’s difficult, Bernie Sanders wants to combat it.”

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate allocated the last of its funding for the current academic year at its meeting Tuesday evening in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. The Senate granted $1,300 toward a second annual Wheelchair Basketball Tournament later this semester. The Senate also gave $700 toward the Concerts Committee.
The 2015 tournament was organized by Zack Wentz, a sophomore majoring in economics, and sponsored by USC Trojan Pride in conjunction with USG University Affairs Committee and Wellness Affairs Committee to bring awareness to disability accessibility on campus. Wentz requested funds from the Senate after Trojan Pride was unable to fund the tournament for the second year.
Sen. Eric Dubbury noted the time-sensitive nature of the event, which took place in April last year.
“I think it’s smart to give most of the money now because it’s time sensitive,” Dubbury said, “I don’t want to put the event at risk.”
All Senators voted to fund $1,300 for the upcoming Wheelchair Basketball Tournament, which was decreased from the initial $1,500 request.
The decision left around $2,200 for other funding requests. The dearth of funds proved troubling for Concerts Committee representative, Caitlin Harriford, who requested $3,000 during last week’s Senate meeting, for upcoming Concerts Committee events. Senate members suggested a further delay before voting on the funding request, which would delay the vote two weeks after it was first requested.
“You could need more money or you could need less money,”  Sen. Jacob Ellenhorn said. “And before we make a decision, we need to know how much money you’re going to get from the other committees.”
Harriford was concerned with the second suspension of the vote and reiterated her request from the previous week.
“In our presentation from last week, we expressed that [regardless of] the amount you give us, it’s good to know, because we’re sitting on offers and setting up production. I’m trying to expedite this process,” Harriford said.
Sen. Giuseppe Robalino questioned the necessity of the request, and if Concerts Committee could locate funds elsewhere, considering the size of the $3,000 request.
“It’s a difficult thing to think about, for me at least, speaking personally because we are the giver of last resort here,” Robalino said. “I’d prefer to hear back from exceptional funding before we exhaust the last money that USG has. So I’m partial to tabling it.”
Sen. Chris Fong proposed an initial funding of $500 to give Concerts Committee a temporary figure to work with, which the Senate agreed was the best manner to proceed.
“It’s not about the amount, but the transparency,” Fong said.
USG Sen. Sabrina Enriquez echoed Fong’s statement.
“We can give X amount today, and if you need more, you can get back to us,” Enriquez said.
Senate members settled on a figure of $700 to grant to Concerts Committee, instead of the initial $3,000 requested.

John Kiriakou, the former chief of counterterrorism operations in Pakistan and the author of Reluctant Spy: My Secret Life in the CIA’s War on Terror, addressed students and community members Tuesday.
In 2007, Kiriakou was the first U.S. government official to confirm that illegal torture methods were used to intimidate al-Qaeda prisoners, and, after being charged under the Espionage Act of 1917, was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison. As a seasoned CIA agent, Kiriakou spent years as a Middle East analyst specializing in Iraqi affairs and served in Bahrain, Washington D.C. and Greece before his imprisonment.
During his talk, “Keeping Government Honest: Whistleblowers, Torture and America’s War on Terrorism,” Kiriakou spoke about his experiences in Pakistan and his interaction with one particular CIA most wanted criminal, Abu Zubaydah, and criticized the CIA approach to tackling the war on terror.
According to Kiriakou, after he had captured Zubaydah in a raid that ended up being the largest al-Qaeda catch in CIA history, the FBI was able to acquire actionable intelligence through milder interrogation techniques.
“But the CIA didn’t like the fact that the FBI had taken over primacy in this case,” Kiriakou said.
Due to the disagreement, President George W. Bush agreed to take the FBI off the case.
“Within 24 hours, the CIA began torturing Zubaydah,” Kiriakou said. “And immediately, [Zubaydah] clammed up.”
Torture techniques, according to Kiriakou, spanned from the infamous “waterboarding” approach, which simulates drowning, to sleep deprivation, in which the individual is kept from sleeping for 14-15 days. By day 12, Kiriakou said, the detainee almost always begins to die.
“[No government official] was ever prosecuted,” Kiriakou said. “We’re talking about premeditated murder, possibly. Manslaughter, at the very least. But nobody was ever prosecuted.”
According to Kiriakou, Zubaydah was waterboarded 83 times and, to this day, CIA leaders claim that they were able to obtain actionable intelligence through these torture approaches.
“That’s just a lie,” he said. “And these same CIA leaders keep repeating this lie, over and over and over again, hoping that people are either too ill-informed or too stupid to understand that it is a lie.”
Even now, after the CIA attained any possible information from Zubaydah, Kiriakou said that Zubaydah can never be released and, moreover, will never be allowed to have contact with a journalist.
“No matter what happens, no matter who is president, Abu Zubaydah will never have a day in court,” Kiriakou said. “He will never be able to face his accusers. He will never be charged with a crime. He will never have the constitutional rights that anybody in American custody has. This is a failure of the Obama administration.”
Kiriakou added that the way in which the U.S. government tackles the war on terror and the carelessness with which it arrests and incriminates potential criminals is flawed. A chief example of this, Kiriakou said, is the mistaken abduction of Khaled El-Masri, a German and Lebanese grocer. After realizing they had arrested and tortured the wrong man, the CIA released El-Masri and created, according to Kiriakou, “a fundamentalist Muslim extremist. Before, he was just selling fruits and vegetables. We made him an extremist.”
It is this irresponsibility, Kiriakou said, along with governmental agencies’ refusal to adhere to privacy policies, that led to his eventual distrust of the government. In fact, Kiriakou’s discussion about the lack of privacy for U.S. citizens shocked many students in the audience.
“[I was really surprised to hear] about the government having access to all of our information,” said Emily Goodspeed, a freshman majoring in computational neuroscience.
While he staunchly disagrees with the CIA and holds a deep resentment for the agency, Kiriakou also said that he feels that the CIA is “an anomaly.”
“It’s the CIA that’s working outside the law. It’s not [Americans]. These wonderful people — this is what America is. That’s how I got through [the bitterness].”

Trojan athletes dominated the Pac-12 All-Century Men’s Swimming and Diving Team, which was announced Monday night. The list of 32 athletes included 10 Trojans — the most of any Pac-12 school. Stanford had seven athletes and Cal had five.
Included on the list was Joe Bottom (1974-77), Bruce Furniss (1976-79), Murray Rose (1959-62), John Naber (1974-77), Lenny Krayzelburg (1997-98), David Wharton (1988-91), Steve Furniss (1971-75), Erik Vendt (2000-2003), Hongping Li (1986-89) and Brian Earley (1991-94). The selected Trojans represented a wide range of events, from long distance swimmers to platform divers.
Nine of the 10 Trojans chosen for the team were Olympians and retired as well-decorated athletes. Rose was a six-time Olympic medalist who formerly held the world record for the 400-, 800- and 1500-meter freestyle. Naber was a five-time Olympic medalist with four golds who formerly held six world records, and now serves as an Olympic ambassador for the United States. Steve Furniss won a bronze medal in 1972 and held the record for the 200-meter individual medal until 1975, when his brother Bruce succeeded him. Krayzelburg won four gold medals in his time as an Olympic backstroker. He won three at the 2000 games in Sydney for the 100- and 200-meter backstroke as well as the 4×100 medley relay. In the 2004 Athens Olympics, Krayzelburg won another gold medal in the 4×100 medley relay. He also broke the world records for the 50-, 100- and 200-meter backstroke in 1999.
Wharton also won a silver medal and held a world record for the 200- and 400-meter individual medley. Vendt brought home two silver medals and one gold from the 2000, 2004 and 2008 Olympics. Li, who was a NCAA champion and two-time Olympian, is now in his 16th year as the head diving coach at USC. These athletes represent the highlights of the last century of USC swimming and diving, which has been a dominating force both nationally and internationally. Early was an NCAA champion platform diver in 1992 and 1994.
The All-Century Team also named USC men’s swimming head coach Peter Daland as the Men’s Swimming and Diving Coach of the Century. In his legendary 35 years at USC, the Trojans won nine NCAA team championships and took second 11 times. Daland’s team also notched 17 league championships, and his swimmers won a combined 93 NCAA and 155 Pac-10 individual and relay titles. Out of those 35 years, he saw 20 undefeated seasons.
Outside of USC, Daland coached the U.S. men’s swimming team for the 1972 Olympics and the women in 1964, leading the men to nine gold medals and the women to six golds. His All-Century Award serves as a crown jewel of a lifetime of accomplishments for the USC swim and dive program. The disctinctions USC earned as a whole cemented their place as the leader of the Pac-12 men’s swim and diving.

One of the most contentious topics attached to the USC Athletic Department is the absence of a Varsity Men’s soccer team at the university. In order to comply with Title IX — the federal law that seeks to provide parity for female athletes in proportion to the number of male athletes enrolled — USC cannot afford to offer a men’s varsity soccer team without subtracting an additional program.
This sacrifice seemingly deprives USC and its students from engaging in the beautiful game, but ask anyone on the men’s club soccer team, and they will say otherwise. Although they lack official recognition from the NCAA, or funding from USC Athletics, make no doubt about it: The men’s club soccer team takes pride in being part of USC.
It is a truly unique program, and one would be hard pressed to find a club level team that operates and competes with similar intensity. Without a varsity team, the club soccer team has an even greater responsibility to represent USC and contribute to its athletic tradition.
“There is that mentality on and off the field, just putting the USC jersey on, you’re representing the University of Southern California as a soccer program, and there is something extremely special about that,” head coach Adam Gootnick said.
The club competes with other student organizations for facilities and money and is limited in resources. USC does accommodate them, however, by offering practice space and trainers, as well as games on McAlister Field.
The team is currently comprised of 20 individuals, ranging from freshmen to fifth-year seniors. Tryouts are held at the beginning of each semester with over one hundred students auditioning for just a few open spots. That sizeable pool is a testament to the competitiveness of the program, which has had tremendous success over the past few seasons. The team competes in two leagues, fall and spring, against college club teams from across the country. Placing high in these leagues qualifies them for a regional tournament and can result in a birth to the National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association national championships in Arizona.
The time commitment mirrors that of any sports team, requiring multiple weekly practices in addition to games and weekend-long tournaments throughout the school year. This makes the students’ commitments to the team even more impressive; receiving no financial aid, preferred registration or other athletic benefits, they play purely for the love of the game. According to Gootnick, many of the players could have played at the Division I level elsewhere, but decided to pursue an education at USC instead.
Talking to the players about their experiences, it became evident that the program represents so much more to them than a recreational outlet. Senior Ryan Favero, a four-year participant, detailed the irreplaceable feeling of being on the team.
“When I first got to USC, I felt really lost in this big school,” Favero said. “The soccer team helped me find a group of guys who loved what I loved. I can’t imagine my time here without it.”
The team offers a unique opportunity for the players to travel to other schools. Many players call these trips “weekends [they’ll] never forget.” The men’s club soccer team is a fascinating concoction, possessing the competitiveness of a major sports program and camaraderie of an intimate student organization. For the players, it represents so much more than a club sports team; it is a family here at USC.
In addition, the club promotes volunteerism among the students through a partnership with a non-profit program called Kicks for Kids, which was founded by a former player. The program enables special needs kids in the greater Los Angeles Area to participate in youth soccer, and the USC players often engage as coaches and mentors.
Tryouts have already been held for this season, but the men’s club soccer team will hold tryouts for next fall. There will be three home games on McAlister Field this semester.

When Steve Sarkisian was let go by Pat Haden this fall, the pressure and criticism could not have been higher on the Athletic Director. In the most embarrassing and public way possible, Haden’s hire for the football program had failed. In his only other big-name decision, Haden looked even worse in the basketball department, where head coach Andy Enfield and the Trojan men’s program had only put together a few conference wins in the two seasons since Enfield was brought in. With multiple strikes at the time, it was not just Sarkisian, but also Haden who was being called on to resign by some critics.
But as Haden watched the men’s basketball team demolish UCLA for the second time this season last Thursday, he knew his doubters would be silenced for at least a little bit.  For Haden personally, he knows now that he has in fact left this University’s athletic department in a better position than when he took it over, and he is ready to hand it off.
As we look back on his legacy, there are of course mistakes and decisions he would probably want to correct with 20–20 hindsight. Of course, his defining decision, his last decision, the hiring of Clay Helton as the permanent football program will really define his legacy as an athletic director. But the resurgence of the men’s basketball program in the months after all of the controversy surrounding the football team proves that Haden has done at least one big thing right. As we look back on his legacy, we should appreciate the challenge he faced and the patience it takes to reestablish an athletic program.
How Haden dealt with — and eventually fired — Lane Kiffin is arguably an even more interesting saga than Sarkisian. During the heyday of the Pete Carroll era, while Carroll brought in an NFL level defensive mentality, the Trojans also were dominating on the offensive end with two different Heisman Trophy winners and lots and lots of points.
Kiffin was the offensive mastermind behind that, and left the Trojans to make the jump straight into a head coaching position in the NFL with the Oakland Raiders. Though his stint in Oakland as a head coach was not terrifically inspiring, and very brief, as was his stint in between as the Tennessee head coach, there was certainly reason to believe that he had potential as an elite head coach. And as he’s proven again in Alabama as the Crimson Tide’s, he can be and still is very much an elite offensive coordinator. But he just did not have what it took to be a head coach. There was that fantastic 10–2 season with Kiffin back in the 2011 season. But that proved to be more of a fluke than anything else, and the Trojans need something more consistent as a program head going forward.
As has been discussed plenty of times in this publication, the hire of Sarkisian should have been vetted more. Yes, he had personal issues develop after his hire, but there was writing on the wall from his previous stint in Washington. He had one epic recruiting class, one which the current program will reap the benefits from for another couple of seasons. But Haden was slightly too caught up in nostalgia for the Carroll era when he decided to hire another Carroll disciple.  It was time for USC to break away from that.
But in Enfield, Haden found someone that encapsulates the best of what Sarkisian and Kiffin had to offer. Enfield has enough strategic knowledge of the offensive game to make the Trojans into a successful team, like Kiffin did as a coordinator. The Slam City mindset that Enfield brings to the table on offense is not just fun and exciting to watch, but is the spread offense equivalent in basketball. Finally, in his third season, we’ve seen that he knows how to effectively implement the system and turn USC into an offensive threat.
But he also can recruit like Sarkisian. The influx of talent on the men’s team with guys like Julian Jacobs and Jordan McLaughlin is the other key reason why USC is becoming a top 25 national program.
Again, the key to Haden’s legacy will be the result of the Helton hire more so than the Enfield hire. But there’s a lot of similarities between Helton and Enfield. Helton may not be a mastermind on offense, or the world’s greatest salesman, but he has the personality that just makes people want to play for him. And when you look at Enfield, that’s essentially what he brings to the sideline. If football can keep the momentum that basketball started, Haden will have plenty to cheer for as he makes the transition to a full-time fan.

Correction: A previous version of this column stated that Athletic Director Pat Haden was responsible for the hiring of former head football coach Lane Kiffin. Kiffin was hired by former Athletic Director Mike Garrett. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

The men’s volleyball team begins a four-game homestand with a rematch against No. 11 Cal State University Northridge Wednesday at the Galen Center.
USC (2-8, 2-6) visited Northridge (7-4, 2-4) Jan. 15, for its 2016 MPSF home opener. USC was ranked No. 13 in the nation and CSU Northridge No. 14. The Matadors upset the Trojans in four sets (25-21, 23-25, 25-22, 25-19).
Senior outside hitter and captain Alex Slaught led the team with 15 kills, but Northridge junior outside hitter Jakub Ciesla bettered him with a season high of 22. His teammate, redshirt freshman middle blocker Eric Chance, added 12 kills in 14 attempts in his debut performance against the Trojans.
This time around as underdogs, USC brings a new lineup to the table.
Sophomore setter Gert Lisha and junior middle blocker Andy Benesh, with hand and back injuries respectively, both missed the first match against the Matadors. Tonight, they will be on the court together for only the fourth time this season. The team is still adjusting to the new play style.
“It’s a change,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said. “Jack [Yoder] and Gert are different in how they set. Gert likes pumping the middle and spraying the ball around. Each has their own style of play.”
Lisha has started each of the last two matches at setter, and Nygaard is impressed with his quick improvement.
“What I like most is that he went from Irvine, where he was a little undisciplined at the net, to San Diego, where he had five blocks against them. He was staying a little bit more disciplined and got rewarded for it,” Nygaard said.
In the match against San Diego, Lisha was the team leader in blocks — a title that often goes to Benesh. Since his return from injury, though, Benesh has not put up the same dominant numbers at the net that were common last year in a season that earned him All-American Honorable Mention.
“With Andy, it’s gonna just be getting [back to his] comfort level,” Nygaard said. “Having a whole month off, missing that training, takes its toll.”
With the team getting healthy, Nygaard is excited for progress.
“We’re running a better offense, currently,” Nygaard said. “Our outsides actually played really great against Northridge, [and] they’re improving daily.”
Look for Slaught to have another big game and to be joined by breakout sophomore opposite Jon Rivera. Since MPSF play began, Rivera has passed Slaught as USC’s kills leader with 108 on the year.
While Nygaard is impressed with the team’s growth, he expects more concentration and better communication.
“We have got four important matches — all of them winnable — within a week, so it’s gonna be demanding,” Nygaard said. “Now is the time to be extremely mindful and extremely mature. Now is the time to really buckle down.”
This four-game homestand marks the halfway point of MPSF play, so if the Trojans are going to get in position to make a run late in the season, they are going to have to get some wins this week.
To expedite the team’s progress, Nygaard has made midseason adjustments to his communication with the team.
“I’m recognizing that my method of communication for them has not been as received as I once thought,” Nygaard said. “It hasn’t been internalized or understood to the depths that I try to communicate, which is on me to recognize earlier and make sure that I’m streamlining things so that it’s more palatable to them so we can move forward. There has to be a bridging of the gap [between us], and once we get that, I think communication will get better.”
While the team is still working out kinks in its communication on and off the court, Nygaard wants the team to play mindful and consistent ball rather than let emotions run the game.
“Northridge consistently passes below the league average, so we need to be able to serve the ball with pace,” Nygaard said. “And that’s a mental trick to be able to do that consistently as opposed to just [hitting] the crap out of the ball.”
Nygaard expects Northridge to be extremely physical, but USC has seen similar teams since their last matchup. The key for a USC victory will be their awareness on the court.
“If we could be more in the moment, way more mindful of what we’re supposed to be doing, then we’re going to make monster gains moving forward,” Nygaard said.

Following the epic Super Bowl 50 performance this Sunday by pop stars Coldplay, Beyoncé and Bruno Mars, chatter and gossip have been hitting the social media world hard. Beyoncé is featured on the newest single by Coldplay “Hymn for the Weekend” and the music video has caused a lot of controversy surrounding one topic in particular: cultural appropriation. 
The video features Beyoncé, dressed in a traditional Indian Desi outfit, acting as a Bollywood dancer. Coldplay travels to India to see her film. Despite the beauty of the music video, critics think that Beyoncé is participating in cultural appropriation by depicting the Desi culture. 
Cultural appropriation by definition states that this ideology surrounds when one culture adopts and emphasizes aspects of another culture. This doesn’t necessarily have to be negative. Of course, we have all seen the way this behavior can go wrong. “Blackface” is just one egregious example — often seen too many times even on college campuses — of true negative cultural appropriation. 
But is this video really “appropriating” the Desi/ Hindi culture? I think not. The negativity associated with cultural appropriation is often considered part of a greater “power” role. For example, a white person painting their face with black paint is making light of a power dynamic that has been oppressive in nature for hundreds of years. 
However, Beyoncé, dressing as a Desi woman and acting as though she is a Bollywood dancer with full respect to the culture doesn’t seem to be a case of true cultural appropriation. Beyoncé is merely representing, in very similar honesty to the truth, what the Bollywood culture is about. The outfits and jewelry and dance represent a piece of a culture in a way that is respectful and beautiful and in no way presents a negative corruption of the culture itself. 
It is always important to be sensitive to the issues within cultural differences around the world, especially in the entertainment industry. However, it is also important to recognize the difference between negatively impacting or representing a culture and artfully and appropriately recognizing it. Beyoncé, in the “Hymn for the Weekend” music video, is in no way negatively or contradictorily represents the Desi culture.

A wise person once told me that for college students, food falls into only two categories: 1) peanut butter and 2) foods to put peanut butter on. So if you love peanut butter as much as I do, you’ll feel me on this.
When you get that late night craving and the only thing you have to eat in your dorm room is peanut butter, so you end up eating half of the jar.
 
1. When you get that late night craving and the only thing you have to eat in your dorm room is peanut butter, so you end up eating half of the jar.
   2. When Ralphs is out of the creamy JIF so you have to get crunchy.
 3. When you don’t have time to brush your teeth and someone is like, “Did you just eat peanut butter?”

4. When your school is a peanut-free environment so you have to eat your peanut butter sandwich in secret.

5. When people judge you for putting peanut butter on everything.

“In restaurants, there’s always a barrier between the dining room and kitchen — even when you have an open kitchen layout. My goal was to create a kitchen where you could really feel like you were a part of it. I wanted to take away the boundaries and have the kitchen as a centerpiece of where guests would dine, like in my home kitchen,” said Timothy Hollingsworth, chef and founder of Otium.
According to the restaurant’s website, “Otium is a contemporary restaurant that aims to strip away the formalities of dining while focusing on the quality of food, warm service and relaxed casual ambiance.” The restaurant itself was designed by Hollingsworth, who has 13 years of culinary experience in Napa Valley. Also according to Hollingsworth, the restaurant’s name, Otium, “has its roots in Latin, a word that is meant to emphasize a place where time can be spent on leisurely social activities.”
Located next to the contemporary museum, The Broad, Hollingsworth states that “Otium perfectly complements the element of modernization through its boxy geometry and sophisticated rusticity composed by a strong but limited palette of natural materials including steel, glass, wood, copper, stone and ceramics.” Walking past the copper heat lamps and fire pits outlined by a mixture of cabbages, rosemary and violets on the outside patio, one is soon immersed in the relaxed  yet modular ambience upon entering the restaurant. Set with dimmed lights, the interior is framed with hanging glass teardrops, a giant leafy wall mural and cozy tables that extend past the open kitchen.
The restaurant appeals as both a casual and formal dining place for customers varying from working-class women and men to romantic couples. Its interior design directly complements the style of Hollingsworth’s cuisine, characterized by both simplicity and approachable elegance.
As one enters, customers are cordially greeted by the waiter and arranged to sit at the lower bar to closely observe each and every step of composing a sashimi. The one-sheet menu conveys minimalism through its usage of simple text and structure. Instead of items titled with sophisticated names, the offerings are directly described with its ingredients on the menu. The offerings are listed in the order of appetizers, main entrèes and desserts. By flipping the menu, one can find a list of cocktails offered by Julian Cox, one of Los Angeles’ most accomplished mixologists.
The hamachi, avocado and sweet & sour tomatoes  was composed of three rolls of tender hamachi and vividly marinated tomatoes, complemented by a thin spread of avocado puree sprinkled with spices and topped with a few hints of green sprout and two delicate nori. The hamachi had a smooth and refined texture, with a  neutral taste accentuated by the acidic flavor of the marinated tomatoes and buttery taste of the avocado spread. The avocado puree was very artistic, providing both aesthetic and sensory pleasures.
Next came the second appetizer, which was a freshly baked funnel cake, buttered with melting foie gras and strawberry jam, garnished creatively with a mixture of green fennel leaves and white fennel strands. The texture of this appetizer was perfectly balanced, as the soft texture of the foie gras contrasted with the crunchy texture of the funnel cake; both complement one another, as the buttery texture of the foie gras melts within the funnel cake in one’s mouth. The strawberry jam added a hint of sweetness to the taste, neutralizing the overall rich taste of the appetizer. The raw fennel strands provided a balance to the fully cooked funnel cake. This appetizer neutralized the acidic taste of the previous appetizer and served as a teaser for the upcoming main entrèe.
The main entrèe then arrived: spinach bucatini with an egg, bacon, clams and crème fraiche, topped with a delicate, soft boiled egg yolk. The overall creaminess was slightly overwhelming at first but quickly established its savoriness. The little pops of crunchiness from the bacon provided random elements of surprise throughout the meal.
Overall, the best dish was the funnel cake as it provided several distinct tastes altogether in one dish. The only negative aspect about this place would be the pricing. The total came out to $75 for only two appetizers and one main entree (after adding an 18 percent service fee and tax). Although it is not an ideal restaurant for casual dining, it may be a perfect place for a romantic date or celebratory event. For those who plan on dining here, make sure to make a reservation ahead of time as they are very busy and are usually booked until closing time.

I went to a movie with a friend a couple weeks ago and saw a fantastically attractive couple making out in a row ahead of us. They both had tumbling waves of shiny chestnut hair that formed a single, luscious sheet as they kissed without concern for their myriad onlookers. They even looked like they smelled good.
I pointed them out to my companion and we stared in awe, attraction and a tinge of jealousy. “I will never make that attractive of a couple,” I said in jest, and we both laughed.
It was mostly a joke, but I think it’s probably a true statement, at least at this time of my life. I know I have an acquired taste in mates. I’m used to the perplexed “Huh” and the “I guess I can see how you think they’re cute” commentary when my friends Facebook-stalk each new flame. It’s not that any of my objects of attraction are wholly unattractive — none of them are — but none are wildly attractive either.
Allow me to illuminate this tendency. I went to a Q&A with Quentin Tarantino — on a date — a few weeks back. As he excitedly expounded the genius of The Hateful Eight — I was lukewarm about it myself — I realized in one horrific instant that everyone I’ve been enamored with is basically some variant of Tarantino.
This is not to say that each one is a millionaire high school dropout with a foot fetish and a penchant for B-movies, but there’s a little bit of Tarantino in each one. As we all know, Tarantino is not terribly attractive, either in look or deed. His timbre is high-pitched and nasally, he looks perpetually unkempt, and he is famously conceited. But he is nevertheless my number one celebrity crush because he owns his unattractiveness in a style that should be the envy of every supermodel.
That’s what I like about my former and current lovers — their confident ownership of their imperfections. Take, for instance, the incessantly chatty man, whose Tarantino-like wit justified his constant stream of language. Or the nasally chef whose unattractive pitch was redeemed by his earnestness. There have been designers upfront about their foot fetishes, lifeguards confident in their lack of ambition, sensitive computer scientists comfortable being ultra-judgy and poets who struggled to pass WRIT 140. All of them flawed, all of them wonderful.
But what is important to me is that they all frame their unattractiveness in attractive ways, a trait conventionally attractive people don’t necessarily have to learn. Perhaps my legacy as a thoroughly unattractive child beat this value into me, but I know I’m not the only one who thinks this way. To quote a dear friend a few weeks back, “attractive people kind of suck.” This isn’t to say that beauty or goodness preclude anyone from being honest, nor is it to imply that one must be flawed to be genuine. But there’s bravery in being both good and bad, and that’s what gets me every time.
What I like about crass people, ugly people, rude people, the Tarantinos of the world, is that they don’t take the easy way. It is socially simpler to showcase good qualities and hide the baggage away — in other words, to be conventionally attractive. No one takes their retainer to a romantic sleepover, am I right? But introducing one’s flaws gets harder the longer you know someone. Suddenly, revealing imperfections becomes jaded rather than intimate, more so than if these flaws had been obvious from the beginning.
As scary as it can be, I do my best to hold myself to this same standard because I know I feel most comfortable with people who accept me in my complicated entirety. In my experience, the best people to do that are those who have come to terms with their own complications. Their refusal to mask their flaws makes me think more critically about what I hide and what I bring to the surface. Every new partner is an opportunity to examine how I view my own strengths and weaknesses as much as it is a chance to explore the depths of another. I may never be half of the couple inspiring awe and envy in public, but I will have meaningful, respectful and deeply personal relationships. That’s plenty for me.

Award-winning Australian hip-hop electro duo Hermitude will kick off their American tour in conjunction with Keys N Krates in Hollywood for their sold-out show on Feb. 20 at the Fonda Theatre. The duo, responsible for “The Buzz” — a track that received more than 7 million hits on Spotify — has recently released their new album Dark Night Sweet Light, featuring 11 new songs and four bonus tracks. Angus Stuart, also known as “El Gusto,” and Luke Dubber, better known as “Dubs,” have hit all the popular music festivals this past summer, some of which include HARD Fest, Lightning In A Bottle and Lollapalooza. This tour marks the first time Hermitude will be traveling across the United States on a tour bus.
The duo brings a vast set of experience to the table with former collaborations with Estelle, Luciano and Big K.R.I.T. In addition, they have had their song “HyperParadise” remixed by popular electronic music producer Flume. Fans can expect Hermitude to bring high levels of energy to the crowd keeping them on their feet at the concert next week — an element they hope to bring on the rest of the tour. In support of Canadian electronic duo Keys N Krates, Hermitude will join them and plan to play a mixture of tracks from their older and new albums. The show will also feature a full live setup and visual gears with the usage of GoPros attached to all the equipment to allow fans to see the performance in different perspectives and angles.
Dark Night Sweet Light,  released in May (and re-released as a deluxe version at the end of August), provides a different set of tracks from their previous albums such as “HyperParadise” and “Parallel Paradise.” Luke “Dubs” Dubber had a chance to explain that this record features a cohesive theme with more simplistic sounds and less overlapping drops.
“We basically were trying to write a record that was more minimal,” Dubber said, in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “In the past, we tended to crowd out the songs with lots of different sounds. It’s easy to keep layering stuff, until you get something you like, but it takes a lot of the time to write an album that is a bit more spacious and only has three or four parts to a song. This is a bit more difficult because everything is so out in the open, so it has to be a very solid part of the song and important piece of the puzzle.”
Electronic hip-hop, a relatively new genre for Australia, has filled the charts in America for quite some time. Hermitude was one of the first bands to restore the genre back to the Australian music scene, recently winning the Best Independent Dance/Electronica album award at the Jägermeister Australian Independent Records Association awards.
“Australia went from looking abroad for new sound, to creating a new sound, and now everyone is looking here for a fresh new sound,” Dubber said. “It’s been amazing to be a part of that.”
The duo gained high levels of popularity after their hit song “The Buzz” was released in 2015, though they initially did not expect to receive fame from that specific track but rather from “Through the Roof.”
“What is really awesome about ‘The Buzz’ is a lot of the time when you’re writing records, there’s always something in the back of your mind like ‘we need a song that’ll get caught on the radio and get us out there.’ ‘Through The Roof’ was what we thought was going to be the radio hit, and we put that song out and it did OK, but then we were deciding which single to put out next, and our record label wanted us to go with ‘Searchlight,’ but we wanted to go with ‘The Buzz,’” Dubber said.
Hermitude has always dedicated much of their time in ensuring that their records are dynamic.  Their most recent album definitely meets this criteria.
Hermitude’s upcoming show with Keys N Krates will take place Feb. 20 at the Fonda Theatre in Hollywood. Expect to hear raving reviews about their live set-up, high energy and visuals from critics and fans alike.

For most USC students, Undergraduate Student Government elections don’t matter. Heck, 70 percent of Trojans don’t vote for their student leaders.
A change in the campaign process for the student government offices is as relevant to the average student as a shift in how his or her Panda Express is prepared in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center below it.
But USG members, whose connection to the organization is shaped by countless matching profile pictures and bonding retreats, have plenty to say about USG leadership for the upcoming year.
Trojans’ newsfeeds might be full of people urging them to vote for their candidates, but it’s likely the posts were made by students who are already in office.
This is a change. Before this semester, students involved in USG weren’t allowed to vocally support candidates for a presidential, vice-presidential or Senate position. But now anyone can openly promote whichever candidate they choose.
And this is a huge problem.
When USG members couldn’t openly endorse candidates, it forced candidates to approach regular students. To get someone to share their campaign message, they had to reach outside of the office and get groups who wouldn’t normally vote invested in their platforms.
The Rini-Jordan campaign boasted more endorsements than any other ticket in history last year with the support of 45 organizations. The campaign reached diverse groups of students, from the men’s rugby team to the Lebanese Club.
As the elections continue, both presidential and vice presidential tickets have attracted endorsements from student organizations. But presidential tickets also occupy the profile pictures of the Executive Director of Program Board and Committee Directors.
It’s easy to get the people who run the voting booths active in the process. But when they’re the only ones, it defeats the purpose of students choosing their own leaders.
The change is problematic because it taints not only who votes for the office, but also the office itself. The positions that candidates aren’t elected into are chosen by the people already in USG. The Executive Director and Finance Director of Program Board help decide who inherits their positions. Their picks also co-hire PB Directors. When these USG members run or endorse candidates, it makes students hoping to keep, promote or get a position reluctant to support another candidate.
In this election, anyone with social media can see that many USG members are for the Edwin-Austin campaign. Because of the professionalism of our student leaders, it’s extremely unlikely that supporting the opposing Henriquez-Pham campaign costs a position or promotion in USG, but someone in an interview at an office full of Giants posters is not about to put on a Patriot’s jersey.
Even if USG supported Edwin-Austin and Henriquez-Pham equally, this change in the election process changes the student government itself. Within a few more years, we could look a lot more like UCLA, whose divisive politics have colored activity in student government.
Members of UCLA’s student government are vocal about whom they support, even split into political parties — Bruins United and LET’S ACT. This has proved to be alienating and, at points, destructive. Rather than encourage students to get invested in the issues, the election process has derailed into identity politics.
“USC’s student government system and election process becoming more like UCLA’s is unnerving.” said Jennifer Frazin, a junior majoring in English and critical studies. As a Jewish student, her anxiety comes from the outbreak of anti-Semitism demonstrated by LET’S ACT, whose members made national headlines for rejecting Jewish students like Rachel Bedya from office based on her Judaism.
At UCLA, the party divide became less over platforms and more of a schism between Jewish students and people of color. BU nominated a Jewish presidential candidate, Heather Rosen, while LET’S ACT supported Morris Sarafian, who partook in the anti-Semitic line of questioning Bedya that hit The New York Times.
Instead of endorsing candidates, Bruins in student government took each other down, with accusations of privilege, selling drugs and Jew-hatred. Members of each party cried hysterically as elects were announced.
But after the election, peace was not made. Candidate Kevin Casasola said his loss signified that voters don’t care about the issues he faces as a queer Filipino, rather than that they disagreed with his platforms. USC needs an election process that encourages a collaborative environment. Candidates with opposing viewpoints are essential, as is collaborating and respecting each other. USG cannot be captive to identity politics, let alone internal hostility.
If USG members need to keep quiet about whom they’re voting for, it’s worth the sting.

In solidarity with students of Native American ancestry, Brown University officially recognized Columbus Day as Indigenous People’s Day as of Feb. 2, effectively dismantling a pillar of symbolic oppression. In this instance, Brown is seen as a leading university that works for diversity, while USC’s disregard of the matter perpetuates a legacy of enslavement, exploitation and genocide and is a blatant stab in the back to Native American students. All things considered, this comes as no surprise — why would a university that does not include Native Americans as part of its student race demography and in fact places them under the empty moniker of “Other” — show solidarity for a population it intentionally does not recognize? Just as the faculty at Brown voted to designate the second Monday in October as Indigenous People’s Day, the faculty, staff and student body at USC must remind the administration that its silence in the face of oppression is compliance with the displacement of Native American culture and history in academic spaces.
It is important to note that USC does not observe Columbus Day officially; however, its failure to acknowledge what this day symbolizes to Native Americans is an extension of years of oppression, and it does nothing to accommodate the subsequent anger, frustration and betrayal students of indigenous backgrounds may feel. In opposition to the nationwide observance of Columbus Day, a counter-celebration such as Indigenous People’s Day sends a message of support and visibility to a group that has been kept in the shadows of white picket fences, Western notions of civilization and the American Dream. In light of the massacre, enslavement and degradation of Native Americans throughout our nation’s history, ignoring what this day means to Native Americans is just as insulting as observing Columbus Day. Both practices work to erase Native American history and culture, which in fact was the goal of Columbus and the later repercussion of settler colonialism that devastated the Native American population.
The veneration of Christopher Columbus is an act of violence directed at indigenous communities because it intentionally prompts the idolization of a man who “discovered” America while stealing the property, life and future of Native Americans. In the same way that it is unacceptable to identify Adolf Hitler as anything other than the man behind the Holocaust, it also inappropriate to attribute Columbus to anything but a man responsible for the genocide of Native Americans.
Inaction on the part of USC contributes to Columbus’s legacy — a legacy intended to diminish the experiences, perspectives and shared histories of indigenous students.  Doing nothing sends a message of unapologetic indifference to these students.  Clearly, USC does not feel obligated to refute generations of oppression to create a safe and inclusive academic environment. However, it should be of utmost importance for the University to stand in solidarity with students of Native American ancestry by not only addressing but also condemning the observation of Columbus Day.
Brown’s decision to institute Indigenous People’s Day should be commended and mirrored by USC. After all, Native American students, too, are a part of USC and deserve the respect, recognition and legitimacy that was not afforded to their ancestors some generations ago.

Last Tuesday, the National Labor Relations Board announced landmark results for USC’s faculty union vote, allowing USC, the largest private university in the state, to organize faculty. Though unions aren’t good or bad per se, it’s paramount to keep in mind that they also aren’t a panacea to the growing concerns of adjunct faculty, rooted in issues that are decades in the making and larger than this campus alone.
In terms of the vote’s breakdown, two of three schools voted to join Service Employees International Union 721. Non-tenure-track faculty members of the Roski School of Art and Design and USC International Academy, by votes of 31 to 6 and 32 to 3, respectively, approved union representation. USC’s oldest school, the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, however, rejected union representation in a close vote, with 113 in favor and 127 against. According to the Los Angeles Times, faculty who voted in favor of unionization were “frustrated with large workloads, low pay, shrinking benefits and poor career prospects.”
By no means an isolated incident, this latest development is a phenomenon that stretches far beyond this campus. Over the past years, a wave of contingent unionization has swept the nation. The University of Chicago, Boston University, Georgetown and Loyola University Chicago all have organized faculty. Just last February, faculty at Tufts also voted to approve union representation.
At face value, unions are powerfully beneficial entities. Without them, there would be no organizations to reign in unfettered capitalism. Yet, it is also unions, along with a volatile political and economic environment, that drove industrial giants such as General Motors and U.S. Steel to disintegration. Hopefully, academic unions will tell a different tale. In a perfect world, all professors should be in a position that provides support in balancing responsibilities and research efforts.
The reality, however, is that higher education is always evolving, for better or worse. The growing reliance of universities nationwide on adjunct faculty has made for an increasingly competitive and unstable job market in academia. For the 2012-2013 academic year, the American Association of University Professors reported that 76 percent of all higher education instruction positions were filled on a contingent basis. In addition, this number has increased 300 percent from 1975 to 2011.
Risa Lieberwitz, professor of labor and employment law at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told Fortune that universities have become “more corporate in the way the structure themselves.”
With this disproportionate hike in the number of less expensive, more flexible adjunct professors, fewer tenure-track positions open. For those who don’t see tenure in the near future, the security of a union becomes more appealing. Meanwhile, as factory jobs disappear, unions are focusing more on recruiting professors who are now more open to their message.
It comes as no surprise then that the National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions reported a 17 percent increase in faculty and graduate students who are part of collective bargaining unions when looking at data collected from 2008 to 2010.
Those statistics may see continual increase with a recent National Labor Relations Board ruling made December 2014, which expanded the option of unionization to a greater number of faculty members at private universities. This is an opportunity that had previously been limited by the 1980 U.S. Supreme Court decision in NLRB v. Yeshiva University. The decision stated that full-time faculty are “managerial” and therefore, not eligible for collective bargaining. The new ruling sets detailed criteria for determining which full-time faculty are eligible based on their involvement in areas such as finances, curriculum and enrollment management. It cited growing “corporatization” in university decision-making and that “colleges and universities are increasingly run by administrators, which has the effect of concentrating and centering authority away from the faculty.”
Yet, even as a strategy to combat this “corporatization,” unionization will not solve all employee concerns. After all, like most systems, things are more complicated than they seem. With SEIU 721 now in the picture, the relationship between administration and faculty could become strained, or even adversarial. There are options out there that don’t require unionization — from asking for a review of salary to expressing views in the Academic Senate, as Provost Michael Quick stressed in an email to staff members on Jan. 6.
Many possible routes exist. At the end of the day, however, no matter what the future holds or what disagreements arise, there’s one thing both administrators and faculty need to keep in mind. Working conditions matter, wages matter and resource allocation matters. But it is educating students that matters most.
Your union history is a bit vague: “yet it is also unions, along with a volatile political and economic environment, that drove industrial giants such as General Motors and U.S. Steel to disintegration.” Yes, volatility, always a devil, eh? And why bother be specific, or to add that GM and US Steel both were at the top of their profit game precisely when the unions were as well?
But it’s your conclusion that gets me most- “but it is educating students that matters most.” I mean, really, how many folks can you get to line up against such a statement and, more importantly, have you any notion that faculty unions are interested in weakening higher education? It’s precisely the exploitation of adjunct faculty that threatens educational quality as anyone can tell you who has been or is an adjunct who struggles and juggles between various jobs to make a living, and who knows but often hasn’t the time or resources to provide, what he or she knows, is the best work in the interest of students. And why? Because the pay is so awful and the benefits if any so little, and the job security so tenuous. Only a little more than 1/3 of USC faculty are full time tenure/tenure track faculty, “traditional” faculty. Does that suggest to you that “administration” is super-interested in “educating students” and unions aren’t? The union is interested in strengthening faculty, and that IS pro-student, so, please, stop with the facile equivalences.

Philip Zimbardo, a renowned psychologist best known for conducting the Stanford prison experiment, spoke about the nature of evil, shyness and heroism in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Monday night in an event hosted by the USC Speakers Committee and Undergraduate Student Government Program Board. 
Throughout most of his career, Zimbardo, professor emeritus at Stanford University, has examined the question of what evil is and how it can be defined. Raised in the South Bronx, Zimbardo noticed the ubiquity of men in his neighborhood attempting to seduce young kids to do bad things. He wondered what the difference was between children who could resist these temptations and children who could not. 
Initially, he believed resistance to evil depended on a loving mother who taught her child about right and wrong, but when he began studying psychology, he realized that it was not the children who were at fault, but the poverty they found themselves in.
“Poverty is a systemic evil that affects young people in inner city ghettos,” Zimbardo said. “Impoverished life breeds a seductive evil for kids living in a world filled with easy sex, drugs, gangs, violence criminal activities and hustlers.”
As he delved deeper into the psychology behind evil, Zimbardo questioned what makes good people go bad. He presented the opportunity for wrongdoing that arises with anonymity as a potential driving force behind evil actions, asking the audience to remember trick-or-treating as children on Halloween.
“When kids are wearing masks, they steal twice as much candy when [signs] say to take one,” Zimbardo said, provoking guilty laughter from the audience.
Zimbardo continued by discussing the Milgram experiment, in which psychologist Stanley Milgram had young students at Yale University shock other participants in order to understand the motivations of Nazis involved in the Holocaust. The experiment showed that, given the pressure of a confident leader, ordinary people could systematically torture and even kill others without questioning their actions. 
This question was tested in Zimbardo’s most famous psychological trial, the Stanford prison experiment, in which participants were arbitrarily assigned the role of prison guards or prisoners and subsequently began acting in ways that reflected their respective positions. For example, the “guards” began abusing the “prisoners” to excess, a fact that Zimbardo pointed out using the warped mindset of a specific participant, dubbed the “John Wayne” of the prison guards, as an example. 
“Let’s be like puppeteers here. Let’s make these people do things,” Wayne said in an interview regarding the motivation behind his physical abuse toward the prisoners. Using this example to illustrate the nature of evil, Zimbardo concluded that unchecked power is the recipe for oppression.
Zimbardo also considered how to stop and prevent evil, a subject that he linked to another of his main areas of research — shyness, particularly in males. According to Zimbardo, self-confidence facilitates intervention in situations where evil is being committed; however, shyness and thus a lack of willingness to stand up against evil is growing. 
“From 1970 to 1980, 40 percent of people said that [they were] currently shy, 40 percent said [they used] to be shy, 15 percent said [they were] shy depending on the situation, and five percent said [they were] never shy,” Zimbardo said. “Now, two thirds of currently shy people say [their shyness] has become a personal problem.”
Zimbardo introduced the idea that this rise in shyness, particularly in males, can be attributed to increased video game use and pornography viewing, thereby heightening men’s access to instant gratification and decreasing their motivation to exercise their social skills.
Zimbardo explained that, since those findings, he has started a shyness clinic which encourages people to become mentors, to limit cell phone use and most importantly to teach responsibility and resiliency at home. 
This development of self-confidence is what makes a hero, someone who Zimbardo said “act[s] on behalf of others in need or in defense of a moral cause.”
One example of heroism in particular caused the audience to collectively cheer. Lin Hao, a nine-year-old boy who, after an earthquake destroyed his school in the Sichuan province of China, rushed back inside to rescue his friends from the rubble. When was asked why he took such a risk, Hao said “I was the hall monitor. It was my job to look after my classmates.”
Heroism, according to Zimbardo, isn’t just reserved for those who prepare for it.
“The decision to act heroically is a choice that many of us will be called upon to make at some point in time,” Zimbardo said. “Real heroism — you’re only going to have that opportunity once, and you will know for the rest of your life you could have done it, but you did not take the action. Silence, apathy and indifference should never be an option.”

It was the BuzzFeed report heard round the world. Last Friday, the news site claimed that Twitter was planning to replace its signature reverse chronological timeline with a redesigned algorithmic feed that would prioritize presumably better content for users. While this would make popular content harder to miss, many were concerned that other voices would be muffled after the change. As a result, the internet went into an uproar that got #RIPTwitter trending with even some celebrities weighing in:

This wouldn’t be the first big change for Twitter users either. In the past year alone, the company has added a curated Twitter Moments feature, removed the 140-character limit from Direct Messages and switched its signature star icon for favorites to a heart icon for likes as part of an ongoing effort to make the social media site friendlier to new users.
On Saturday morning, however, CEO Jack Dorsey stepped in (on Twitter, of course) and put the rumors to rest.

Apparently, the outrage wasn’t all for naught though. The Verge acquired screenshots from somebody who has been in a Twitter test group for months trying out the redesigned timeline. It looks nearly identical to the company’s current one, but on further inspection, you may notice that the tweets are out of order. Supposedly, you’ll even be able to find related posts for popular tweets that interest you. Most importantly, however, you’ll be able to opt out of the algorithmic timeline similar to Facebook’s timeline that lets you sort by Most Recent or by Top Stories.

While I would personally be open to the change for various reasons, there’s much bigger fish to fry. Going forward, I’m excited to see if and how Twitter addresses the many requests for better spam and abuse policies, a tweet edit option and more cat GIFs. As somebody who loudly mourned Twitter favorites but am now a huge fan of likes, I’ve learned to respect the blue bird’s choices.
