This year’s freshman class is more diverse than the 2010-2011 freshman class, according to The University of Southern California Freshman Profile and Admission Information for the 2011-2012 school year, released Friday.
Changes in the profile include an increase in admitted students and enrollees as well as an improvement in applicants’ standardized test scores.
For the 2011-2012 school year, 37,210 students applied for admission to USC, compared with 35,794 in the 2010-2011 school year.
The percentage of enrolled international students also increased by 4 percent.
More international students enrolled in USC from the South Pacific this year; countries like Singapore and Indonesia are better represented than areas in Europe and Asia, such as the United Kingdom and Turkey.
Enrolled USC students balanced out to an even male-to-female ratio, compared with 45 percent male and 55 percent female last year.
First-generation college students also increased from the previous year, with the new class comprised of 14 percent first-generation college students, compared with last year’s 12 percent.
The estimated total cost of attendance increased, rising from a total of $55,578 to $57,876.
This increase in expenses also comes with an increase in the quantity of scholarships USC granted to students.
Thirteen more scholarships were given to incoming freshmen in the class of 2015 than to the class of 2014 for a total of 679 Trustee, Presidential, Dean scholarships and the new Mork Family scholarships that grant students full tuition as well as a stipend for their time at USC.

In the face of growing concern over the high cost of textbooks, publishers are suggesting professors customize their textbooks, which could result in lower costs as technology allows for decreased printing costs.
Once read · Used versions of custom books usually cannot be bought online the way mass-produced textbooks can, nor can they be sold back. - Photo illustration by India Bulkeley | Daily Trojan
Students will gather on campus today to protest the rising cost of textbooks as part of a nationwide petition called Textbook Rebellion to make textbooks more affordable.
Custom textbooks allow a professor to select chapters from various books, add customized links and include personal notes in a textbook tailored specifically for his or her class.
“How many times have you taken a class and you only use one chapter [of the book]?” said Raymond McDermott, senior manager of course materials at USC’s Pertusati Bookstore. “By doing customs, professors can do a custom version that only has certain chapters and can add instructive notes.”
Publishers try to print several thousand copies of custom textbooks, and as professors try to do smaller prints, the cost per page increases.
Equipment has improved recently, however, and now publishers are able to keep the cost relatively low on mid-size prints, McDermott said.
Custom textbooks have been available to professors for about a decade, but they are becoming popular now because of a publisher’s ability to print at lower costs.
“Publishers are seeing their sales decrease because students are buying used books, so instead of assigning the generic textbook, they have to customize to USC,” McDermott said. “Students therefore have to buy their textbooks here.”
The cost of custom textbooks varies depending on how much a professor decides to revise or select from original textbooks. Sometimes it might be half of the original price; other times it might be an 8 percent reduction in price, McDermott said.
Though McDermott said custom textbooks are a better financial deal for students, students are usually unable to purchase used custom textbooks online
The problem with purchasing textbooks from other stores’ websites, McDermott said, is that if a professor has a custom textbook, students will be getting the additional information and supplies that come with the bundle.
“Although I understand the purpose of custom bundles, textbooks at the bookstore are always overpriced, so we end up paying more than we would pay from other, more affordable suppliers,” said Nikola Vavic, an undeclared sophomore.
The majority of USC professors who use custom textbooks teach general education courses, and  the bookstore has about 25 different G.E. classes that customize books.
Typically large classes use custom textbooks because of printing costs, McDermott said.
“The economics of doing smaller print runs does not make it very feasible unless it’s a class of, say 300 students,” McDermott said. “The most inexpensive way to print books is on a huge press.”
Though some students said they worry the price of these custom bundles will raise their overall spending on textbooks, others understand the necessity.
“I think they’re a really good way for professors to specify what they expect in the class, and students don’t feel so overwhelmed when they get a 500-page book and think they have to read it all,” said Connor Virjee, an undeclared sophomore.
Fight back. Avoid the campus bookstore. Go online if you want cheaper textbooks. As long as some people are still paying retail prices the publishers are not going to be compelled to end their monopoly on student’s wallets. Go online and search for used books, international editions, older editions, rentals, and even e-books to combat the high prices. The only problem with this solution is that there are so many places online promising cheaper books. That’s why I use http://www.bigwords.com They are a textbook price comparison search engine that searches all the  online retailers and rental site to find you the best prices, no matter which format you are seeking.

The USC men’s golf team returns all of its players from last year, looking to make another trip to the NCAA championships — and possibly further — as it opens its 2011 season today at the Kikkor Golf Husky Invitational in Washington.
USC heads into the competition ranked No. 11 in the Golf World/Nike Golf Preseason Coaches’ Poll.
The Trojans have advanced to the NCAA championships final five years in a row under USC coach Chris Zambri. Despite starting off slow the last couple years, junior Martin Trainer knows the offseason preparation should enable the team to be focused in its first tournament.
“We’ve been working hard on the course the last few weeks trying to get ready for this tournament,” Trainer said. “We’ve just been working on all aspects of our game and doing what we need to do to get ready.”
Trainer, the 2011 Pac-10 championships individual champion and an All-Pac-10 first teamer, has aimed to correct weaknesses in the offseason to help improve his game.
“I’ve been working on my short game and I’ve really made an effort to take a step in the right direction,” he said. “Putting, chipping [and] my bunker game was a weakness, so I’m trying to convert that into a strength.”
Along with Trainer, the Trojans return senior Steve Lim — a 2011 All-Pac-10 second teamer for the second consecutive year — junior Sam Smith and sophomore Jeffrey Kang, also an All-Pac-10 second- team selection.
Smith was a 2011 All-Pac-10 honorable mention as well, boasting three top-10 finishes and five in the top-20 last season.
Joining them are junior Stewart Hagestad and sophomore Ramsey Sahyoun. Adding to an already experienced squad, USC bolsters its roster with freshmen Daniel Lee and top recruit Anthony Paolucci.
Lee, who starred at West Ranch high school, finished 18-under while winning the 2009 Thunderbird Junior Invitational. He also tied for fifth at the 2010 Junior PGA Championship.
Paolucci, for two consecutive years (junior and senior), was the No. 1 player in the country while prepping at La Jolla Country Day high school and was the 2010 Rolex Junior Player of the Year. Paolucci also earned a sponsor’s exemption into the 2011 Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines, a PGA Tour event, and finished the event in the top-30.
“He made the cut and beat Tiger Woods [at Torrey Pines],” Trainer said. “That just shows you how good he is. He’s been struggling a little bit, but I expect him to turn it around and be a huge contributor to this team.”
Trainer has set goals for the upcoming season and hopes to expand on last year’s success.
“I want to be a first-team All-American, but more importantly, I want to win a national championship,” he said. “That’s what we preach at USC and the whole point of being here is to win that title.”
The Trojans will tee off at the Olympic Golf Course at Gold Mountain G.C. in Bremerton, Wash.

UC Irvine goalie Jimmy Friedrich knew what to expect, but couldn’t do enough to stop the Trojans from handing the Anteaters a 7-4 loss Saturday.
Friedrich played for USC (6-0, 1-0) for three years as an undergraduate, and despite 14 saves on Saturday, the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team proved too much once again. The Trojans previously bested the Anteaters 11-4 in the NorCal tournament last weekend.
USC kicked off the match with three quick goals in the opening minutes of play. The Anteaters, however, were not deterred, as Friedrich did just enough to keep the USC offense at bay.
“I think our defense was fine,” senior driver Peter Kurzeka said. “We held them to four goals. However, our offense struggled. We failed to put away some shots early.”
Despite being denied an early lead, the Anteaters battled back, trailing 4-2 at halftime. They would cut it to a one-goal game after an early goal in the opening moments of the second half. But the USC offense was jumpstarted by the play of Kurzeka, who scored two goals and notched two assists at critical moments in the game.
Goals from redshirt sophomore driver Stephen Siri and junior drivers Forest Monroe and Michael Rosenthal helped USC pull away from UC Irvine.
“It was a low scoring first half,” Kurzeka said. “Both of our teams are defensive[ly] minded and they wanted to stop our counter attack. And obviously we want to hold them to as few goals as possible. If we don’t take our chances early then they stick around.”
Part of the reason UC Irvine was able to keep the game close was its familiarity with USC’s game plan.
“They definitely scouted us better,” Rosenthal said. “They knew some of our center plays better and thought of ways to attack us differently. They came out with a lot of energy. We have a target on our back because we are three-time defending champions.”
USC coach Jovan Vavic had his own explanation as to why the Anteaters were able to keep it close for most of the match.
“Our team was a little more tired this game because we trained pretty hard, and UCI looked more rested,” Vavic said. “Last time we played Irvine they had a very tough game against Long Beach before we played them, so we got them tired. [This time] our defense was good, and we only gave up four goals. Offensively, we could have done a better job but I think it was because we were tired.”
After its victory over UC Irvine, USC defeated Golden West 10-8 in a scrimmage, giving some of the younger players an opportunity to play.
“It’s definitely a good experience for those guys,” Rosenthal said. “Golden West is not a shabby team at all. They came out, got a win and those guys don’t always get a lot of minutes, so it’s good they got minutes in that game.”
USC continues play on Thursday, facing Princeton at 7 p.m. at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.

It’s become an all too familiar story. The USC women’s soccer team watches its opponents celebrate a thrilling victory, while  it is left completely shocked.
All too often, there has only been silence on the Trojan sideline after the final whistle. And the Women of Troy’s (3-7-0) loss to Washington State (7-3-1) was no exception.
Early surge · Junior forward Samantha Johnson (right) scored on a header 14 seconds into the Women of Troy’s Pac-12 opener against Washington State. It would prove to be their lone goal of Sunday’s contest. - Jaideep Chadha | Daily Trojan
With the score knotted at one in the 86th minute, Wazzou forward Brandi Vega singlehandedly dribbled through three Trojan defenders and took off down the right sideline.
Matching her run unmarked down the middle was midfielder Jocelyn Jeffers. Vega centered it on a platter, and Jeffers slotted it past a helpless sophomore Shelby Church in goal.
“It sums up everything we’ve been through this season,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “We lose focus in the most crucial moments in front of the goal. We lose our discipline.”
That loss of discipline was the culmination of a Cougar onslaught over the previous 25 minutes.
Washington State forced three corner kicks in quick succession and recorded 11 of its 18 shots in the second half.
“I don’t even know what to say,” senior defender Claire Schloemer said. “It’s a heartbreaker. It brings back Texas.”
Schloemer referenced the Women of Troy’s last game at McAlister Field two weeks ago, when they blew a 1-0 lead in the 80th minute before going on to lose in overtime.
This time looked like it might be different. Off the opening kick, sophomore midfielder Haley Boysen broke free down the left sideline before launching a centered pass to senior forward Samantha Johnson, streaking down the center of the field. Johnson headed the ball right over the keeper’s shoulder for her first goal of the season.
Fourteen seconds in the Trojans had the lead.
The rest of the first half was mostly Women of Troy-dominated as well.
Senior midfielder Carly Butcher had a pair of blistering shots from long range, including one that hit the crossbar and went straight down.
The USC sideline screamed that the ball crossed the goal line and went in, but the referee just shook his head.
“I thought for the first 60 minutes we were the better team,” Khosroshahin said. “And then about the 65th minute they stepped up and we shrank.”
A more apt time, in the 67th minute, the Women of Troy suffered the same type of defensive breakdown that has plagued them all season.
After the Women of Troy conceded a free kick deep in their own half, Cougar defender Rachael Doyle ended up with the ball to the left of the USC goal.
She headed the ball back into the box, and it slithered all the way through the mass of Women of Troy defenders, Cougar attackers, and Church and found its way into the side netting to tie the game at one.
“Just a lack of attention to detail,” Schloemer said. “[The scorer] didn’t even attack the ball. It just hit off her head and went in.”
It’s starting to become desperation time for the Women of Troy, as they are in danger of suffering their first losing season since 1992.
Now at the halfway mark, the Women of Troy have yet to win at home, and face the daunting task of the Pac-12 ahead.
The Women of Troy will get another chance to right the ship next weekend when they host the Oregon schools at McAlister Field.
It now starts to become more of a need for them to get back in the game mentally. Often teams that become fixated on their string of losses become paralyzed, resulting in a continued wnward spiral. Hang in there. You have the talent.
Women of Troy and Coach Khosroshahin keep your heads up.  The Trojan family is behind you 100%.  It will come together just keep plugging away.

No. 2 USC wrapped up play Sunday with a final score of 888, just shy of Arizona State, which finished third with a score of 884.
The final 18 holes marked significant improvements for the Women of Troy.
Senior Lisa McCloskey, who entered 1-over-through the first two rounds, finished tied for eighth at 2-over-par, along with sophomore Sophia Popov. Morris, who shot an eight-over to begin the competition on Friday, finished tied for 52nd at 13-over-par. Freshman Kristen Park rode a five-stroke jump to conclude her first tournament at 14-over-par and tied for 57th. Inah Park placed 62nd at 15-over par .
Saturday was a bit of struggle for the Women of Troy, as they dropped to seventh place at 16-over-par, 13 strokes behind first-place UCLA.
Popov reeled off 10 consecutive pars to conclude play and finished tied for fifth at even-144, her second consecutive even mark.
McCloskey finished tied for 15th at 2-over-par, while both Kristen Park and Inah Park concluded at 10-over 154 for 59th place. Sophomore Rachel Morris jumped up 10 spots to 65th as she finished 11-over-par.
The Women of Troy began the tournament off to a fast start, led by 2011 National Golf College Association Freshman of the Year, Popov, who kicked off her sophomore campaign with a second-place finish. With Popov, USC led after 18 holes. Despite inclement weather throughout the day, the Women of Troy finished at 4-over-par, a stroke over Arizona State and four-over crosstown rivals UCLA.
Popov, an early Player of the Year candidate, recorded three bogeys and two birdies in the last six holes, finishing Friday’s round tied with six others at even.
Arizona State’s Justine Lee led the pack at 1-under par. McCloskey, one of five returning starters, finished tied for ninth at 1-over and, like Popov, birdied her last two holes. Park, the nation’s top recruit, also finished at 1-over par, compiling two bogeys and a birdie in her impressive debut. Senior Inah Park began 2-over par with two birdies, while sophomore Rachel Morris finished 8-over par.
“It was a great start to the season,” USC coach Andrea Gaston said. “The key was we persevered in tough conditions and finished strong.”
UCLA won the tournament with a final score of 873, followed by Alabama at 879.
Duke’s Lindy Duncan and Alabama’s Jennifer Kirby led all players with scores of 4-under 212.
Next up for the Women of Troy is the Stanford Invitational, Oct. 14, in Palo Alto, Calif.

USC coach Mick Haley might not think his women’s volleyball team is the best team in the country right now, but after this weekend’s play, it’s making a strong case.
Clean sweeps· The Women of Troy celebrate their fourth consecutive win. In each victory, USC has won by a score of 3-0. - Olivia Garcia | Daily Trojan
No. 12 USC toppled No. 1 California in straight sets (25-23, 25-20, 25-22) Friday to hand the Golden Bears their first loss of the season, before promptly making quick work of No. 2 Stanford on Saturday (25-23, 26-24, 25-23).
Despite sweeping both opponents, Haley said his team needs improvement in several areas.
“There were way too many hitting errors, we didn’t serve tough enough and we did not pass well,” Haley said. “[But] sometimes winning a little bit ugly is okay. I felt pretty good that we could play that close and still come out on top.”
Though USC trailed 12-11 in the first set against Stanford, junior outside hitter Katie Fuller jump started the team with back-to-back kills to give the Women of Troy a 15-13 lead. Knotted at 19-19, sophomore outside hitter Sara Shaw chipped in with four consecutive kills to aid USC in capturing the first set.
The Cardinal took control early in the second set, but USC would not be deterred again. Senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter and Fuller played a pivotal role in breaking a 19-19 deadlock, giving the Women of Troy enough momentum to pull away down the stretch.
Much like the first two sets, Stanford held an early advantage but USC battled back, overcoming another slow start to capture the third set and sweep the Cardinal for the first time since 2006.
Jupiter finished with 15 kills and 11 digs, while senior setter Kendall Bateman recorded 41 assists and nine digs against the Cardinal. Shaw notched 11 kills and Fuller had 14 kills and nine digs. Sophomore libero Natalie Hagglund finished with 23 digs in the three sets.
Jupiter, who is the focal point of USC’s offensive attack, credits the recent play of Shaw and Fuller, for giving the Women of Troy a balanced attack. According to Jupiter, it gives USC four offensive weapons its opponents need to worry as opposed to focusing too much on her and Williams.
“I’m very excited, especially because we’ve been working very hard since we kind of had a rough start in the preseason,” Jupiter said. “It’s good to see that [hard work] is really starting to pay off.”
Against California, it was Jupiter who helped the Women of Troy jump out to an early lead.
The Golden Bears battled back, however, knotting the score at 17-17 before USC freshman middle blocker Hannah Schraer, senior middle blocker Lauren Williams and Shaw combined to tally the final eight points of the set, giving the Women of Troy a first-set win.
But in the second set, the  Women of Troy, again, fell behind early. But behind Jupiter, Shaw and Fuller, USC hit .405 in the second-set victory, giving the team 39 kills through the first two sets.
USC finished off California in the third set in a back-and-forth affair that saw 14 ties and six lead changes. The upset was USC’s first win over a top-ranked opponent since the 2004 NCAA tournament.
Since its loss to then-No. 8 UCLA in its Pac-12 opener at home, USC has swept three top-four opponents in the country and four teams in a row. After that early-season defeat, Haley feels his team has improved.
“That game was a real wakeup call, and [after that] I thought we got into practice and kicked it up another notch,” Haley said.
Haley believes his team could get a boost with the return of sophomore middle blocker Alexis Olgard, who might be cleared to play before next weekend’s matches against Colorado and Utah. Olgard is recovering from off-season knee surgery.
USC travels to Colorado to face the Buffaloes on Friday, Sept. 30 at 7 p.m. before heading to Salt Lake City to take on Utah on Sunday, Oct. 2. at 2 p.m.

I can only guess, but things aren’t supposed to grow stale in Tempe, Ariz.
For a college town that never sleeps, that never stops — a West Coast king of nightlife if you will — Saturday night seemed rather familiar, almost clichéd.
USC relinquished a lead in the second half, a routine that’s become near-second nature for USC coach Lane Kiffin’s bunch the last two seasons.
This time nobody blinked. Nobody gave it a second thought. The Trojans were outscored 15-0 in the fourth quarter. They surrendered 22 consecutive points to end the game.
They lost to Arizona State, and by the end, it wasn’t really close.
The Sun Devils were 2.5-point favorites and won by three touchdowns. Fans filed to the exits early. Students rushed to Mill Avenue for post-game drinks. And nobody rushed the field — save for a few Animal House-esque Deltas in the front row.
Nobody attempted to hoist  6-foot-8 quarterback Brock Osweiler in the air. Nobody tossed projectiles onto the placing surface. It was quiet. They almost didn’t need security. For a fan base that hadn’t seen its team beat USC in 11 years, since 1999, it seemed borderline apathetic.
Arizona State coach Dennis Erickson was doused in Gatorade in the waning minutes and chants of “A-S-U, A-S-U” rang throughout Sun Devil Stadium, sure, but for the 61,495 fans in attendance, few even winced.
“Teams are always circling us on their schedules regardless of what people say about USC,” senior linebacker Chris Galippo said in the moments following the loss. “If they beat USC, it’s going to make their season.”
Except it won’t. Not anymore. Not in 2011. Under Kiffin, USC has lost six times. Since Mark Sanchez graduated in the spring of 2009, it has lost nine times to six different Pac-12 schools.
This isn’t Trojan exceptionalism by any stretch of the imagination; it’s plain ol’ mediocrity.
The novelty of beating USC has worn off. It no longer automatically cues a highlight reel. It’s irrelevant, almost. And that might be the toughest reality for any fan to face.
For a program that often wears its arrogance on its sleeve, and proudly, the sobering truth that its role in the college football universe is diminishing as fast as that of the Big East might be the toughest pill to swallow.
Beating USC equates to beating Utah, Arizona or California. It’s another win, pure and simple. It doesn’t alter the direction of a program. You could see that on the Arizona State sidelines. You could see they expected this. It was the Sun Devils’ fourth game of the season and they treated it as such. Playing USC is no longer anybody’s Super Bowl.
And yes, it’s quite the culture change.
Historically, USC has unquestionably been the top dog, the one with a bull’s eye on its chest. It has been controversial. It has been bold. It has been polarizing. It now largely reflects indifference.
And that’s unfortunate because, at times, USC can be quite good. Against Utah, its defense held the Utes to just two touchdowns. A week ago, junior quarterback Matt Barkley tossed five touchdowns, a single-game school record, in a 21-point rout of Syracuse.
Even in defeat Saturday, senior tailback Marc Tyler rushed for 149 yards on nearly seven yards per carry against the Sun Devils.
Its most glaring numbers were penalties and turnovers, though.
USC committed 10 penalties, including three personal foul calls, for 87 yards. It turned the ball over four times — two of them coming in the red zone.
Mediocre teams commit penalties. Mediocre teams give the ball away.
USC shouldn’t be mediocre. It’s too talented, too good at too many positions — at quarterback, at wide receiver and on the defensive line. It has recruited too well to simply be average.
But the perception is as such.
Galippo is right — to an extent. Beating USC has made a team’s season — at least before. Just last season, Stanford, then-ranked No. 16, beat USC at home, and in the aftermath its students stormed the field. Mind you, that same Cardinal team finished 11-1 and beat ACC-champion Virginia Tech in the Orange Bowl come January.
Oregon State, a month later, did the same following a win over a three-loss Trojan team.
The Pac-12 has now adjusted to sanctioned USC. It’s become fixated on the team with the spread offense up north, the team in the Silicon Valley with the Heisman Trophy frontrunner.
USC no longer inspires that same animosity. The opposition doesn’t get riled up. It’s tame in large part. Even the signs directed toward USC from the Arizona State student section were essentially nonexistent, with the exception of a few references to Reggie Bush, paid players and a postseason ban.
For a program that has reprised the role of Goliath so often during the past decade, its latest shot taken to the forehead might hurt the most. Not because it was toppled in defeat. Not because it proved to be the onset of a dramatic collapse, but because hardly anyone watching flinched.
Tempe, at least for one Saturday night, was oddly silent.

need the coach to mature and be more flamoboyant. Remember, it was Lane who called the same runnign play up the middle over and over again, even on a  crucial 4th down that was so predictable evene the coverage guys for texas stormed the hole…in the national champ game. If i was coach, i would have play actioned off that play and thrown a short pass to a TE or reciever probably for a TD, because the whole nation knew what was coming. Lane has never been very imaginitive, or creative. He needs to mix in some daring in with his brilliance. If that happens, the team moves the ball, and the swagger comes back. We are missing the swagger.
“This team is maturing and will get very nasty very soon.”
We’ve been hearing that since 2009. It’s an okay team. Nothing more, nothing less. Ho-hum.
This team is maturing and will get very nasty very soon.  On the other hand, I’d like to see the coach control some of those oddly passive plays he stiffs the team with.  Like a run up the middle on third and long in what appears to be a concession.  Like punt and kickoff returners who don’t happen to be Robert Woods catching the ball and going to one knee in what appears to be a concession.  Let ’em lumber on down the field, coach.  It’s USC, fer godssake.  And don’t remind me about those points after….

USC junior safety Jawanza Starling missed a tackle and Arizona State running back Cameron Marshall finished off a 70-yard run that gave the Sun Devils a 7-0 lead in the opening minutes.
Road bump · Junior safety Jawanza Starling (left), Senior linebacker Chris Galippo (right) and the USC defense look on in the waning moments of the fourth quarter after surrendering 392 total yards and 43 points in a three-touchdown rout at Arizona State. The loss marked USC’s first loss this season. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
That set the tone for the rest of the game as Arizona State (3-1, 1-0) ran away from No. 23 USC (3-1, 1-1) late in the second half to cap off a 43-22 victory at home.
“I thought they came out on fire, as we expected,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “It was a big home game for them with the energy of the crowd. I thought they played really well. They didn’t make many mistakes. They didn’t give us many chances.”
Mistakes — namely penalties and turnovers — seemed to be the downfall for USC on this night despite numerous opportunities to score. The Trojans finished with 10 penalties and four turnovers, with two turnovers (a fumble and interception) coming inside the red zone.
It was Arizona State who capitalized on USC’s turnover midway through the second quarter. With USC inside Arizona State’s 15-yard line, junior linebacker Vontaze Burfict intercepted junior quarterback Matt Barkley. It was Burfict’s first interception of his career.
The Sun Devils’ offense took over at USC’s 48-yard line. Eight plays later, Arizona State quarterback Brock Osweiler connected with wide receiver Jamal Miles for a three-yard pass to give the Sun Devils a 21-3 lead.
“Obviously, this was the first time we were really challenged,” senior linebacker Chris Galippo said. “We were in a hostile environment and this was the first time we were really down and had to deal with adversity.”
After settling for a field goal on its first drive of the game, USC was forced to kick two more field goals after stalling in Arizona State territory. A big reason why the Trojans failed to score after good field position was their inability to convert on third-downs: They were 0-of-6 on third-down conversions in the first half and 1-of-9 for the game, while the Sun Devils were 4-of-7 in the first half and 6-of-12 overall.
Trailing 21-9 at halftime, the Trojans’ offense came out firing in the second half. Barkley completed 5-of-5 passes for 67 yards on USC’s opening drive, connecting with freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee on a 24-yard strike.
On the ensuing possession — after the USC defense stopped Arizona State on a third-and-long — it was the USC running game that came to life. Senior running back Marc Tyler had six rushes for 65 yards on the scoring drive, finding the end zone untouched on a 10-yard run that gave USC a 22-21 lead.
“I was extremely proud of our team in the third quarter,” Kiffin said. “We’re a young team. But I was proud of the way we responded. We took the lead in a tough environment versus a really good team.”
The lead, however, was short-lived.
Osweiler marched the Sun Devils down the field, as Arizona State regained the lead at 28-22 on an eight-play, 76-yard scoring drive as Marshall scored his second touchdown of the game on a three-yard run.
Though Arizona State momentarily regained momentum, USC sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods returned the kickoff to the Sun Devils’ 49-yard line, putting USC in another position to take advantage. Two plays later, however, Tyler fumbled late in the third quarter.
The USC defense managed to keep it a one-score game after holding the Sun Devils on third-and-one. Barkley’s efficiency to open the second half carried over, as he led USC inside Arizona State’s 15-yard line. But Arizona State’s Greg Smith sacked, Barkley, he fumbled and the Trojans drive was halted.
The Arizona State offense, again, would take advantage of another inopportune turnover. Marshall capped off his three-touchdown night with a four-yard run that gave the Sun Devils a 36-22 lead with just under seven minutes to play in the game and another Barkley interception was returned for a touchdown late to seal Arizona State’s first victory over USC since 1999.
“Great teams don’t turn the ball over on the road and great teams are able to take the ball away,” Galippo said. “When you’re backed against the ball like this, you have to finish.”
After tying a USC single-game record with five touchdown passes against Syracuse last weekend, Barkley was just 21-of-33 for 227 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.
Marshall, who was questionable for the game because of a sprained ankle suffered in the loss against Illinois last week, had 141 yards on the ground and three touchdowns. Osweiler was 25-of-32 for 223 yards and two touchdowns.
Despite the inability to execute consistently throughout the game on both sides of the ball, Barkley saw this game as a good learning experience for the team.
“I don’t think it was a matter of energy or focus,” Barkley said. “Our guys were ready to play. But [we have to] learn from this tape and then forget about it. There is nothing we can do — just learn and grow.”
USC returns home next Saturday to face Arizona at 12:30 p.m.

Here in Los Angeles, the city with the largest population of Koreans outside of Seoul, we boast just about every Korean food under the sun — except dog stew.
Minimalist menu · Chin Go Gae offers customers a small, albeit customary, menu, presenting patrons with the best traditional Korean dishes, such as bibimbap, mandoo guk and black goat stew. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
Called “boshintang” (directly translated as “invigorating body stew”), this infamous dog meat stew has given Koreans a bad rap, even though Korea isn’t the only nation with a history of eating dog meat. In an effort to clean up Korea’s “canine-vorous” reputation, the Korean government banned the sale and consumption of boshintang in 1986, but many boshintang houses still exist in Korea, selling the dish under several euphemisms, such as “nutritious soup” and “land sheep soup.”
A few decades ago in Los Angeles, you could have tried dog stew if you knew where to go. It would have been a surreptitious affair; restaurants offering dog stew would advertise their house specialties only in hangul (Korean characters) and refuse to serve it to non-Koreans.
Inevitably, someone found out and raised hell. The thought of boiling a dog outraged many who view it as an inhumane and barbaric act. To be fair, Koreans use a specific canine breed for culinary purposes — a wild creature that looks nothing like the beloved, cute four-legged Fido most people imagine. Dog cookery dates back almost a millennium in Korean culinary history, because until the mid-20th century many Koreans could not afford animal protein.
In any case, animal rights activists won and California now has a specific penal code banning the consumption of “any animal traditionally or commonly kept as a pet or companion.”
But dog stew-lovers have found a way to relive their gastronomic nostalgia with a less controversial protein: black goat.
Traditionally, dog stew was consumed mainly by men as a medicinal tonic (aka for virility). Meanwhile, women’s nutritional version of dog stew was a dark, intense medicine extracted from steaming herbs with black goat, the only indigenous goat breed to Korea. The drink was believed to be rich in protein, iron and calcium, which are essential to women’s health.
Thus, goat meat became the natural substitution for dog meat, especially because the texture of black goat is said to be very similar to that of stewed dog meat, although the flavor of goat is milder and sweeter.
Goat stew is mainly available in the Chungcheong Province, the central-west region of Korea, but it’s not a familiar dish anywhere else, as most Koreans found the distinctive caprine odor offensive.
Oddly, however, there are several black goat stew restaurants in Los Angeles.
Chin Go Gae, located in an obscure strip mall on Eighth Street, is one. If you weren’t looking specifically for this restaurant, it would be impossible to find because none of its signs are in English. One of the signs still reads “Boshintang,” perhaps a remnant from the older times when dog consumption wasn’t outlawed.
The menu at Chin Go Gae is minimalistic; although familiar dishes like bibimbap (mixed rice) and mandoo guk (dumpling soup) have English translations, the main specialties of the house — black goat stew and seasoned goat meat — are listed only in Korean.
But don’t be deterred. Once you firmly communicate with the servers that you genuinely want the meat of the house, they will serve it to you with pride and friendliness, painstakingly explaining to you the correct dining procedures.
The stew, a big simmering pot of goat chunks, green onions and spices such as Korean miso and red pepper paste, is meant to be shared among daring friends. The server will dump fresh dandelion greens and perilla leaves on top of the broth and instruct you to wait until the vegetables are wilted and drenched in the juices before digging in.
Though the broth is fiery red, the heat is mild and the taste is surprisingly clear. The piquant vegetables soak up all the flavors of the meaty, mellow-spiced soup and will be gone before you know it, but the servers will promptly dump in a fresh batch of greens.
The star of the dish, of course, is the goat meat. If you like gamey meat, you’ll love goat. It’s got a lean robust taste, and when braised well, like in this stew, the flesh is meltingly tender with a soft, luxurious texture like pulled pork.
Seasoned goat meat is a dry version of goat stew. The spices are slightly heavier, though the ingredients are the same. The meat looks a lot like shredded beef brisket but with a unique, hearty smell and flavor.
By the end of the meal, rice is stir-fried in the same stew pot with shredded toasted nori, more vegetables, sesame oil and red pepper paste, then left over heat to crisp until the bottom gets golden and crunchy — a wonderful, carby finale to a meaty meal.
Other than Chin Go Gae, Burocho on Eighth Street, Han Mi Jung on Pico Boulevard, Mirak on Western, Chung Ki Wa on Olympic and Nam Dae Moon Jip on Sixth Street also sell similar versions of this goat stew.
Boshintang might have caused a clash of cultures, but the prevalent black goat stew in Los Angeles leaves no controversies. It is delicious, plain and simple — and best of all, legal.

“Here in Los Angeles, the city with the largest population of Koreans outside of Seoul…”
Sophia, this statement is quite loaded.  Are you saying that LA has a larger population of Koreans than Pusan or Taejon?  Are you saying that LA has the largest population of ethnic Koreans outside of the Korean peninsula?  If that’s what you are trying to say then that wouldn’t be true.  That title goes to Yanji City in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, the People’s Republic of China, which has about 400k total and around 1,000,000 in the general area.
This is a very informative and well-written article.  Thanks!

In a telling move, the very first scene of Puncture shows a youthful, vibrant nurse getting stuck with a dirty needle. 
The film makes no bones about its subject matter, or that it has an agenda: advocating the use of safety needles in hospitals around the world. Largely because of its clear objective of portraying an important humanitarian message, the film often resembles a documentary, mostly to its benefit.
Adam and Mark Kassen, brothers and co-directors, tell a true story faithfully, without exploiting the audience or miring the film in melodrama. In doing so, they have constructed something vital and compelling, illuminating the obscure corners of a largely unexplored issue — needle safety.
All that said, the dogged pursuit of truth that the Kassen brothers insist on generates a thoroughly unlikable protagonist. Chris Evans plays Mike Weiss, an ambulance chaser who is also a fervent user of different narcotics, chiefly cocaine. Drugs give him an edge in the courtroom and therefore make him an effective lawyer, despite the fact that they consistently undermine his personal relationships. Weiss takes a special interest in the case of the nurse, who contracts HIV after being stuck.
The primary problem with the portrayal of Weiss is the total lack of an impetus for his interest. The motivation is not an economic one — that much is clear. It’s a good example of how a film that stays strictly true to life without extra development can be a detriment. The audience is led to believe Weiss took the case out of some nebulous sense of morality, without any explained depth or purpose. This aspect of Puncture comes off as inexplicable and contrived.
Why does Weiss possess this morality? What about this nurse provokes such a heroic response? These questions are left unanswered.
The directors don’t exert enough effort toward understanding this man, who is clearly complex and layered. The Kassens instead favor ensuring that the overall humanitarian message of the film is well communicated. This is admirable but still somewhat regrettable; the film has a very strong moral backbone, but it could use a more complex portrayal of the characters’ own humanity.
Nonetheless, the topical film makes an excellent case about needle sticks and the utter necessity of safety needles in hospitals, all without being didactic or overly expository. Well-paced editing and astute cinematography richly contribute to Puncture’s documentary style.
Performances are solid across the board. Mark Kassen, who took on acting duties, makes for an endearing Paul Danziger, Weiss’ partner. Jesse L. Martin and Michael Biehn make refreshing appearances in pivotal roles. And Evans is alert and charismatic as always, although his performance is short-changed by the writers’ inability to understand his character.
Much the same can be said for Brett Cullen as the icy attorney Nathaniel Price, who provides much of the film’s conflict. Unfortunately, he’s given more than a few notably arcane lines, which strain credibility even though his character is an interesting one.
In fact, his character seems to be at the crux of the film’s thematic exploration. Oddly, the Kassen brothers are insistent that he not be the antagonist of the film. It’s an interesting assertion, because no other character suits that role better than he does.
If the characters are to be taken at their words, however, one could argue that the antagonist of the film is not a character but a trait: apathy.
In Puncture, it seems Price once started out intending to make the world a better place. In the bulk of the film, however, he actively tries to prevent Weiss’ case from getting off the ground, with no regard for the lives that could be saved with safety needles.
What happened in between those two phases of his career, Price leaves to our imagination. It’s not difficult to assume that over the years, his sense of justice has been handicapped by apathy.
Apathy is what Weiss and Danziger must combat in taking on a large corporation and its government connections. There are no immediate threats to their lives, and while their livelihoods are somewhat shaky, pursuing the case does not leave them in economic peril.
It’s true that Puncture leaves Weiss’ motivations ambiguous. In the end, though, Weiss seems to be in a fight not against any one particular person or group, but against apathy, including his own.
1. Weiss’s motivation is clearly shown: He says at the taco bus stand  that every hospital employee could be their client.  That’s a huge financial motivation.  Later, in the car/climax fighting with Danziger, he shouts, “At least I have the courage to lose for what’s right!”  These two may conflict, but they’re probably more related to Weiss’s chemical instability than an ambiguous motivation.  He’s in it for the money.
2. Apathy is not the antagonist.  The monied GPO’s and other manufacturers who have paid millions to get their cheaper needles into the hospitals clearly are the antagonists.  They do not want to have to pay more to make more expensive needles (lowering profits) and the GPO’s don’t want to pay more for more expensive needles.  No one is apathetic.
Watch it again.  :^D

What should the name USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences mean?
Seems like an odd question, but with the record $200-million donation Dana and David Dornsife gave to the College last March, it not only got a new name but a chance to reinvent and to create a brand to go with the name.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
The recent news that Howard Gillman, the dean of USC Dornsife, is stepping down makes this an even more critical time for the university to discuss and focus on the school’s future.
Now is the time for all of USC — President C. L. Max Nikias, administration, faculty, students — to seize that chance by giving USC Dornsife the attention it has long deserved, allowing a key shift from a professionally dominated academic culture to a more interdisciplinary liberal arts model.
The Marshall School of Business, Viterbi School of Engineering and Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism each have prestigious reputations and distinct brands attached to their names. One of the reasons for their prestige (and a definite reason so many students desperately hope for admission into the schools) is that they come with a recognizable name and a known and trusted brand as a reputable school.
These schools launch students on conventionally desirable career paths, such as entry-level jobs after college, followed by promotion after promotion.
I’ve even heard Marshall students joke about the worthlessness of non-Marshall students.
The message is: If you’re not branded, if you’re not on a “traditional” career-driven track, then you don’t matter.
The College of Letters, Arts and Sciences has long lived in the shadow of the Marshall, Viterbi and Annenberg brands.
But the Dornsife gift, dubbed “Historic. Transformational. Inspirational,” has the ability to change all of that.
It has prompted a historic and transformational change in the university’s academic culture.
At a Dornsife Commons event on Sept. 22, a conversational venue created to foster dialogue among students and faculty on new possibilities sparked by USC Dornsife, Charles Lanski, professor of mathematics, explained what makes USC Dornsife different.
“Students who are in the College are studying many different sorts of disciplines, [so] we cannot be related to careers or career opportunities as the identification of the college,” Lanski said.
And that is exactly what the USC Dornsife brand should be: A school that does not need to identify itself with any cookie-cutter career path because it allows students to reach across disciplinary boundaries to study what they’re genuinely interested in, whether or not there are specific careers attached to those interests.
USC Dornsife should be a revolutionary, interdisciplinary academic culture that differentiates and expands the undergraduate experience.
The university should make more courses available that are smaller and more rigorous, with a more honed-in focus than intro-style general education courses.
The future leadership will also be integral to the transformation. Since he began his post as dean in 2007, Gillman implemented key growth in USC Dornsife.
Unfortunately, Dornsife is losing exactly the kind of leadership it needs. Gillman created new interdisciplinary majors and minors, fostered more undergraduate research opportunities through the Student Opportunities for Academic Research and Summer Undergraduate Research Funds programs, and recruited top-notch faculty, among other accomplishments.
Finding a replacement dean who will promote USC Dornsife’s diverse, expansive focus is essential to the school’s new vision.
This is a new era for USC Dornsife. How the university handles this era has the potential to redefine the entire university’s future.
We should all take part in seizing this rare chance to rebrand.
And whether you realize it or not, it will impact all students. A second Dornsife Commons event will take place Oct. 27 to further discuss the college’s future.

My vote’s for Steve Lamy, currently one of the Vice Deans of the College.  He is a beloved IR teacher, extremely student-friendly and has visionary interdisciplinary plans for Dornsife.  Give him a shot, Max!
My money is on Nikias taking another faculty member from Berkeley. If not Berkeley, possibly Yale or someone from Oxbridge.

Residents of West Hollywood are well known for their support of forward-thinking legislation, so it should come as no surprise that on Sept. 21, the city council approved a ban on the sale of fur clothing on. It’s a big win for animal rights activists and the first ordinance of its kind in the United States.
West Hollywood has a longstanding reputation of being animal-friendly. The city has already banned the declawing of cats and also has prohibited pet stores from doing business with puppy mills.
The city is making a step in the right direction by passing this historic legislation, and other cities should follow in its footsteps. The ban makes a statement that the fur trade is barbaric, cruel and unfashionable.
The city of West Hollywood has long been known as a beacon of fashion — a trend-setting city. By taking such a definitive stance on fur — an item long considered glamorous — the city is declaring that fur is no longer fashionable, not to mention inhumane.
With our proximity to West Hollywood, USC students should make an effort to support these local boutiques and small businesses that have banned fur. Opponents of the ban have voiced concern about its potential economic effects, but students can play a role in diminishing those concerns by actively supporting the ban.
According to the Coalition to Abolish Fur Trade, every year 10 million animals are trapped in the wild for their fur, caught by leg hold traps, body grip traps and wire snares. These traps have remained largely unchanged for more than one hundred years.
And a review of fur farming in North America by animal rights group Born Free USA revealed the United States is the fifth-largest mink-producing country in the world. Approximately 3 million farm-raised mink are killed annually for their pelts.
Saving animals is as simple as choosing stylish cruelty-free clothing, which is available at every price range and at all kinds of retail outlets, from discount shoe stores to high-end boutiques.
 
Kelly Speca is a junior majoring in narrative studies. 
Being opposed to wearing fur is quite possibly the most retarded ethical stance in the world.
The vast majority of people who criticize fur have no problem wearing leather, despite the fact that both products consist of cutting the skin from an animal, curing it, and wearing it as clothing. There is no ethical difference between wearing cow skin and wearing mink skin, so shut your ignorant, sanctimonious mouth. Thanks.
shut up heather
Actually Kelly, I hate to rain on the show that so many Americans seem to enjoy, but the rest of the world does NOT see  West Hollywood  as a  ” beacon of fashion”  (that’s a new one on me)  Try Paris or London for that title.
On the contrary, the rest of the world outside America’s myopic and hugely inflated self image is that West Hollywood and in fact LA in generall is full of crackpots and is a bit of a joke. 
Dictates such as this fur ban based purely on hysterical emotional rhetoric from single issue groups, using unsunstantiated and highly controversial evidence just goes to reinforce this world view of a city of narcissistic idiots who have lost the plot.
When are  Americans going to get it that the rast of the world is beginning to laugh at you.

The results of the 2011 Youth Tobacco Purchase Survey released this Sept. 22 showed cigarette sales to minors have reached a new low in California.
For the study, 15- and 16-year-old teens were hired to purchase cigarettes at a random sample of 800 tobacco retailers throughout the state. Only 5.6 percent of stores illegally sold them cigarettes.
This year’s rate is the lowest since 1995, when the survey first began, and it also dropped by approximately 2 percent in the last year. The survey also found that the rate of illegal cigarette sales varied upon the particular type of store. For example, 11.6 percent of delis and meat markets sold cigarettes illegally, compared to just 1.3 percent of liquor stores.
While the study illustrates that fewer stores are selling cigarettes illegally to minors, it doesn’t track how teens could be getting cigarettes through other means — such as receiving them through older friends or stealing them. Some experts say those behaviors could be topics of future studies.
Seriously? Sails? I hope this makes it in the print version tomorrow. Ridiculous

When a song is based on a city, most would imagine a video filled with clips of a bustling city. Patrick Stump, lead singer of Fall Out Boy, strayed from that image with the premiere of his first solo video Sept. 20 for his single “This City,” featuring Lupe Fiasco.
The song, off Stump’s upcoming album Soul Punk, pays homage to the two Chicago natives’ city, but the few clips of city life were filmed in California.
There is no storyline to follow or real connection to any city at all, but according to Stump in an interview with MTV, “It would be redundant to take a camera into a city” when the song speaks for itself.
Instead, Stump decided to take an artistic route for “This City.”
Here and there, black-and-white shots of Stump walking the streets of a city pop into the frame, but the rest of the video is of him in front of a camera with a lot of colorful lights and special effects.
Stump told MTV he feels as though the colors and lights by themselves represents life in the city.
The video seems fairly simple, but the special effects edited into it are a little distracting. Although the music is supposed to be the main attraction, the abstractness  overshadows it.
Before Soul Punk is released Oct. 18, Stump will be hitting the road with Panic! at the Disco and Foxy Shazam starting in Reno on Oct. 9.

The Marshall School of Business has implemented a new initiative from Verdiem Surveyor, a major provider of IT energy management and efficiency software. The new system aims to successfully reduce energy expended by PCs and Macs on Marshall’s IT network without negatively impacting users or the IT system as a whole.
A primary objective of Marshall’s IT team is to manage the more than 5,000 PCs and Macs for updates. Having a machine go to a low power state at night when users might still want remote access was a concern for the school.
“One of Verdiem’s selling points for USC Marshall were that it offered a centrally managed solution. Another key piece was its Wake-on-WAN solution that extends Wake-on-LAN technology by providing a reliable and practical method for waking computers over a large organization,” said network engineer Brian Wood, who works in Marshall’s Information Technology Architecture for Academic Information Services, in a press release.
Verdiem’s Wake-On-Wan technology minimizes network traffic and security issues to more effectively allow Marshall to centrally wake remote systems.
The move has been financially rewarding, with the school experiencing a 32 percent reduction in annual energy costs. In addition, it successfully recouped its initial investment within a month through an energy rebate from Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power.
“This measure is helping propel the business school toward its 2012 goal of 80 percent energy savings overall,” said Mr. Wood. “In addition, we’re assisting the entire University of Southern California with implementing Verdiem.”

USC junior safety Jawanza Starling missed a tackle and Arizona State running back Cameron Marshall finished off a 70-yard run to give the Sun Devils a 7-0 lead in the opening minutes.
That set the tone for the rest of the game as the Sun Devils ran away from No. 23 USC (3-1, 1-1) late in the second half, capping off a 43-22 victory at home.
“I thought they came out on fire, as we expected,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “It was a big home game for them with the energy of the crowd. I thought they played really well. They didn’t make many mistakes, they didn’t give us many chances.”
Mistakes — namely penalties and turnovers — seemed to be the downfall for USC on Saturday night despite numerous opportunities to score. The Trojans finished with 10 penalties and four turnovers, with two turnovers (a fumble and interception) coming inside the red zone.
And it was Arizona State who capitalized on USC’s turnover in the red zone midway through the second quarter. With USC inside Arizona State’s 15-yard line, junior linebacker Vontaze Burfict intercepted a pass from junior quarterback Matt Barkley.
The Sun Devils offense took over at USC’s 48-yard line. Eight plays later, Arizona State led 21-3 after junior quarterback Brock Osweiler connected with junior wide receiver Jamal Miles for a three-yard pass.
After settling for a field goal on its first drive of the game, USC was forced to kick two more field goals after stalling in Arizona State territory. A big reason why the Trojans failed to score after good field position was their inability to convert on third-downs: They were 0-of-6 on third-down conversions in the first half while the Sun Devils were 4-of-7.
Trailing 21-9 at halftime, the Trojans offense came out firing in the second half. Barkley completed five-of-five passes for 67 yards on USC’s opening drive, connecting with freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee on a 24-yard strike.
On the ensuing possession — after the USC defense stopped Arizona State on a third-and-long — it was the USC running game that came to life. Senior running back Marc Tyler had six rushes for 65 yards on the scoring drive, finding the end zone untouched on a 10-yard run that gave USC a 22-21 lead.
“I was extremely proud of our team in the third quarter,” Kiffin said. “We’re a young team. But I was proud of the way we responded. We took the lead in a tough environment versus a really good team.”
The lead, however, was short-lived.
Osweiler marched the Sun Devils down the field, as Arizona State regained the lead at 28-22 on an eight-play, 76-yard scoring drive as Marshall scored his second touchdown of the game on a three-yard run.
Though Arizona State momentarily regained momentum, USC sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods returned the kickoff to the Sun Devils 49-yard line putting USC in another position to take advantage. Two plays later, however, Tyler fumbled late in the third quarter.
“Great teams don’t turn the ball over on the road and great teams are able to take the ball away,” senior linebacker Chris Galippo said. “When you’re backed against the ball like this, you have to finish.”
The USC defense managed to keep it a one-score game after holding the Sun Devils on third-and-one. But after Barkley led the offense inside Arizona State’s 15-yard line, he was sacked, fumbled and the Trojans drive was halted.
The Arizona State offense, again, took advantage of USC’s inopportune turnover. Marshall capped off his three-touchdown night with a four-yard run that gave the Sun Devils a 36-22 lead with just under seven minutes to play in the game. And another Barkley interception was returned for a touchdown late in the game to cap off the scoring.
Despite the inability to execute consistently throughout the game on both sides of the ball, Barkley saw this game as a good experience for the team to learn from.
“I don’t think it was a matter of energy or focus,” Barkley said. “Our guys were ready to play tonight. But [we have to] learn from this tape and then forget about it. There is nothing we can do — just learn and grow.”
The look last night on “Coach” Kiffin’s face said it all: I don’t have a clue and I think people may have figured that out.  
Bob Davie’s comment was telling, as he described the enthusiasm and high energy of Pete Carroll’s teams contrasted with the moroseness of the current sideline.  Lane Kiffin is the joke Steve Sarkisian played on the Raiders, then Tennessee, and now SC.  Time to send the Kiffins packing.
Ok the ASU game is now a statistic. Let us not look back to what could have been — an unbeaten season. The Trojans were and are good enough to go unbeaten. 
Now is the time to look toward the next game. The opportunity is simple. Play to win.
Win one game at a time until all games are statistical w’s.
What might it take? First coaches believe in your players. Second players believe in yourselves, your fellow team mates, and your coaches. Third you are playing for the honor of being a Trojan. If you are playing for anything else resign from the team and seek your own selfish self-interest.
Lastly know this… the game of football is simple; when in possession of the football score a touchdown. When not in possession of the football, get the football back and score a touchdown.
Stop reading press clippings whether they are good or bad. Play each play as if the only intention is to score a touchdown. Be the best you can be or better yet be better than you can be. It is the only way to get better.
Encourage the best out of your coaches and fellow players. Don’t settle for anything less than going the extra mile on each play. 
Today do what winners do: Plan to win. Practice to win. Play to win. Win.
Fight on. Win forever.
