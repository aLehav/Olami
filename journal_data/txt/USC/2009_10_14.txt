As storms rolled through Southern California Wednesday, thousands of residents were left without power, including many USC students.
According to the LA Dept. of Water and Power almost 49,700 other customers were without power at some point during the storm, which began Tuesday. As of 8:15 p.m. Wednesday, around 5,500 customers still had no power.
USC students were not untouched by the power outages, as many students in off-campus apartments found themselves unable to switch on their lights or TV’s. A downed tree near 29th and Hoover streets also affected some students in the area.

This year’s annual Health and Wellness Fair, co-sponsored by USC’s Health Sciences Campus, will feature a host of new organizations and partnerships that organizers expect significantly increased participation.
The HSC annually partners with the East Los Angeles Occupational Center to offer information and health screens to local residents. This year, Los Angeles City Councilmember José Huizar and the Consulate General of Mexico in Los Angeles are joining in putting on the fair, to be held at the Occupational Center, across the street from the HSC.
The fair will include more than 50 booths, up from 18 last year, offering information and health screenings for various issues, including Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes and cancer. Bienvenidos (a drug prevention program), the Braille Institute, the AIDS Research Alliance, Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center and Planned Parenthood are among the many newcomers.
“We had a whole year to think it through,” said Cesar Armendariz, community outreach director for HSC. “The Mexican Consulate introduced us to new partners, so that helped. Part of [the growth] is us reaching out, part of it is partnering with the Mexican Consulate.”
USC assisted with another health fair organized by the Consulate earlier, Armendariz said, which helped spark the union. The Consulate’s involvement was also one of the reasons Huizar got involved, according to a spokesman from his office.
With the new partnerships and increased number and diversity of organizations, organizers are expecting a turnout near 1,000. Last year, only about 250 people attended, according to Armendariz, but this year that same number of people will be there just to work the event.
Though the fair provides health screenings and immunizations, Armendariz said the informational booths also play an important role.
“It’s about wellness as well,” Armendariz said. “The sheriff’s department will be educating kids about bike safety, and the fire department will also be there educating people about fire safety. [Information will] run the gamut.”
The East Los Angeles Occupational Center puts on other, smaller events year-round, but this is the largest fair they are involved in.
“[The fair] brings out all the community and raises awareness about things people hear about,” said Occupational Center staff member Adriana Sanchez. “People can bring prescriptions and talk to pharmacists and get medical opinions.”
The fair also provides a hands-on learning experience for a number of students. About 100 USC pharmacy students will be conducting the majority of the health screenings, and cosmetology students from the East Los Angeles Occupational Center will be helping seniors, who will be transported to the fair via USC trams, with manicures and make-up.
“Going to health fairs made me realize you don’t have to be a pharmacist to help people,” said second year pharmacy student Michelle Vu. “Pharmacy students do so much for the community already, especially in Los Angeles. People should go because it’s [completely] free. Patients get screened and pharmacy students practice their counseling skills and put knowledge to action.”
The fair is also a festive occasion. There will be activities for kids, musical performances and an appearance by Bravo Medical Magnet High School’s marching band, which is expected to encourage an increase in turnout. Mostly, however, the fair is aimed at providing health services to those who might not otherwise have access to healthcare.
“It’s a chance for people in the community, especially those with low income and without health insurance, to get some critical screenings,” Armendariz said. “People of any age group can come and benefit from the fair.”

People may have wildly differing beliefs, but when it comes to how the brain processes faith — or lack thereof — it’s all the same.
A USC-UCLA study tested brain activity in relation to religious beliefs. The study found that whether a person is religious or nonreligious, he or she use the same parts of the brain to determine what they believe.
The study, led by author Sam Harris, who recently completed his doctoral dissertation at the UCLA Staglin Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, and USC Research Assistant Professor Jonas Kaplan of the Brain and Creativity Institute, took 15 Christians and 15 people who had no religious convictions and presented a series of statements for them to affirm or deny. The questions varied from commonly understood truths to religious affirmations — for example, “Eagles are real,” versus “Angels are real.”
Using a functional MRI, the researchers mapped changes in brain activity, and found that while the answers were different, the same parts of the brain were used to determine belief — whether the statement was religious or not.
“It’s interesting because these people were diametrically opposed in their beliefs, but we’re seeing something very similar going on in their brains,” Kaplan said.
The results, Kaplan said, proved that belief or nonbelief is controlled by the same parts of the brain, whether or not those beliefs are grounded in religion and whether or not the believer has a background in religion.
“Believing in these different statements is similar as far as the brain is concerned,” Kaplan said. “The results make sense — when people believe things, they believe them, religious or not.”
Religious believers and nonbelievers alike agreed the results of the study made sense, though they had different reasons thinking as such.
Rabbi Dov Wagner of the Chabad Jewish student center said he was not surprised by the results, because rational belief and study is a central tenet of the Jewish faith.
“There is subjective belief, blind faith, but there is also a strong emphasis on logic and philosophy, a rationally engaged faith, which isn’t just intangible, but actually attempts to study, understand and comprehend ideas that relate to faith,” Wagner said. “It’s informed belief, that’s based not just on blind acceptance, but an approach to knowledge that is not that different from the way you approach any part of life.”
Those on the other side of the religion debate likewise agreed the study’s results were logical.
Riley Bell, a sophomore majoring in global health who said she does not subscribe to religious beliefs, said she thought believing in religion was similar to believing in anything else.
“[Religion] is like anything else you would think of as true or false, it’s a way of approaching what’s around you,” Bell said. “There’s nothing that makes it any different, it’s just a created mental state.”
Kaplan said he sees no reason his study should spark controversy in the religious community. The study’s intent was not to validate either stance, but to clarify how the brain processes religion.
“We were totally neutral to the actual answers. We were trying to find out how people process information — what is actually happening. We’re not trying to answer the religious questions themselves,” he said.
A.J. Starsiak, a senior majoring in molecular biology who said he has strong Christian beliefs, said he thought science could actually be useful in trying to understand religion.
“Science is digging in depth, through thought, in that way it’s philosophy of a sort,” he said. “Anything that makes you think more about your beliefs is beneficial … In that way science is definitely a good approach to Christianity.
The subjects of the study were chosen for their strong convictions in either camp, but Kaplan says it would be interesting to explore differences in strengths of believers. The psychology of religion is a growing area, he said.
“Religion is something that is important for us to understand. It’s a part of people’s lives, and it makes sense for us to try to understand it,” Kaplan said. “We wanted to see if there was anything special about the way people’s brains process religious belief.”

When people consider the future of electronic music, the electro-movements currently thriving in France, Germany and other European nations come to mind much more often than the one in Los Angeles.
Binary Entertainment hopes to change that.
The music collective, founded by USC graduates Josh Legg (class of 2007) and Kyle Petersen (class of 2006), aims at providing a wide array of services for its clients, from recording to promotion. The label released its first album Oct. 13 — a compilation record featuring the seven bands currently signed to the label. They celebrated this landmark with a free show at the Echoplex Tuesday.
Focusing on electronic music was not Legg and Peteren’s original plan when they entered the music business.
“I had a job at a music publishing company,” Petersen said. “Josh was doing research work at the time, and he brought up the idea of music management. I had the knowledge in the field and we elaborated on it. At first we weren’t looking to be an electronic record label.”
“We were coming from an indie rock background,” Legg added. “What got our attention was more of a byproduct of when we saw Daft Punk in their live tour in Las Vegas and that was a big moment; it opened our eyes into what you could do with electronic music. You can really incorporate a lot of things from genres we like, like rock and pop and indie rock.”
What sets Binary Entertainment apart from other record labels is its unique business model that enables Legg and Petersen to stay connected with their clients while also allowing them to work with other labels.
“We’re a management company first of all, and our general business model is that we have record deals with each artist,” Legg said. “Since we are a management company, if another record company wanted to do a deal with one of our artists, we could arrange that. For instance, Alfa [one of Binary’s artists] released an album with system recordings in New York.”
“The idea in doing record deals with other companies is part of the umbrella stream, different revenue streams with different artists,” Petersen said. “We’re able to outsource different revenue streams to different companies.”
Binary’s business model came from months of planning on the founders’ part.
“Starting with Napster, things started to fall apart for the record industry. It was obviously crumbling, so we thought, ‘What would a new look like?’” Legg said. “We’re basically not going to make any money on records anymore, so we want to make revenue on everything an artist is doing. It makes sense; an artist is a multifaceted industry.”
Binary’s seven artists, while all unique, share a common musical thread: a new style of electronic music, which Legg and Petersen have dubbed, “dreamwave.”
“Dreamwave came out of a big search on MySpace in terms of finding new musicians,” Petersen said. “We were scouting and looking around, and we found ourselves in a community of electronic artists. We found some that incorporated a lot more melody and vocals that was just different from a lot of the electro music we were hearing. It was a breath of fresh air. We kept listening around and it became clear it was a trend.”
Legg added, “As for the name, we were joking, just coming up with fake band names. We said dreamwave and it was one of those big laugh moments, but 20 minutes later we just started using it, to the point of over-saturation, and it just stuck.”
While Legg and Petersen share a passion for electronic music, they believe the genre has been given an unfavorable stereotype in recent years.
“A lot of people hear electronic and think of raves, glow sticks and ecstasy,” Petersen explained. “But the whole theory behind dreamwave and ’80s sound is it’s all about nostalgia. It’s about peaceful times, innocent times, youth. It’s great music for hanging out with friends and having some drinks, feel good music.”
Keeping with its goal of showing people electronic music can exist outside of the rave scene, Binary selected its seven artists from Los Angeles to move the awareness away from the genre’s traditional home of Europe.
“We want to see these artists as the artists who represent Los Angeles,” Legg said. “In LA high schools this is the most popular music. The unfortunate thing about LA is that there are very few electronic artists they can rally behind and say, ‘This is my city.’”
The company’s debut release, Binary Presents: LA Lights, captures a wide array of styles, all electronic yet distinct in sound. Featuring two songs from the label’s seven artists, the music ranges from the energetic, poppy lyrics of LexiconDon’s “SWMG” to the more ethereal sounds of Keenhouse’s “The Rendezvous.”
Although no two artists on the album sound the same, there is a certain cohesive thread throughout the tracks. All the songs feel perfect for the dance floor, especially Fabian’s “Galourni” with its nonstop beats, and Legg and Petersen’s band NightWaves’ “Blue Dress,” which perfectly encapsulates the dreamwave idea.
“Our motto online that people tend to quote is that we try to bring great songwriting back to the dance floor,” Legg said. “Bands like Depeche Mode and Petshop [Boys] from the ’80s produced great music for dancing. We’re hoping we can do the same.”

Although Los Angeles is now known for its movie stars, many years ago, scientists flocked to the city to look at real stars — the ones in the sky.
Despite the incessant blanket of smog caused by Hummers and light pollution from endless rows of streetlights, Los Angeles sits at a unique location that allows it to look at stars with a clearer view, because there is very little air movement between the Earth and the edge of the atmosphere.
In reality, Los Angeles has served as the Alexandria for astronomy; it houses two world-class observatories — the Planetary Society and the Los Angeles Astronomical Society — as well as the center for Jet Propulsion Laboratories, a research facility managed by the technology powerhouse Caltech Institute of Technology for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
One of LA’s landmarks, the recently renovated Griffith Observatory, boasts the title of most visited and photographed space observation center in the country. Its place, perched on the hills overlooking the Hollywood sign and the city below, is as iconic as the palm trees and sprawling highways that make up most of the city’s visual tale.
The regal, quasi-Greek structure sits on top of the Griffith Park complex, donated to the city by Griffith J. Griffith, a Welsh-American mining industry millionaire who paved the way for the observatory’s opening on May 14, 1935.
Though the industrialist shot his philanthropist wife in the face in a heated dispute and served a mere three years for attempted murder, Angelenos don’t remember him for a lurid past — or even for his grand fortune — but for the elegant, cream-colored observation facility that gave the public its very own special window to the sky.
With solid concrete walls, stately raised ceilings and meticulously restored artwork, the new observatory still retains much of the art deco charm that older Angeleno generations remember from their childhood rite of passage: the field trip to the Planetarium.
Before the massive renovations, most elementary school-aged children in the county would file into a stuffy planetarium with a looming concave ceiling where they could see cheesy lights mimic star constellations as they sat in what looked like a hybrid between a school desk from the 1960s, a dirty, neglected church pew and some sort of dentistry torture device complete with uncomfortable headrest.
Now, the Samuel Oschin Planetarium offers different shows that tell the story of astronomy with a fancy projection system that gives today’s kids a dizzying 3-D version of galaxies they have only seen grainy pictures of in textbooks. The detail hypnotizes the viewer who can appreciate the state-of-the-art digital dance above, but kids may just feel the need to sleep as they recline in a cushy, comfortable chair perfect for napping.
A weekend routinely sees groups of gum-smacking fifth-graders, backpack-wearing tourists and hand-holding couples alike in a packed planetarium coursing with the warmth of lasers and good, old-fashioned human bewilderment.
A futuristic downstairs area with interactive, modern exhibits and a slick auditorium, the Leonard Nimoy Event Horizon Theater seems like a regular modern attraction, complete with screaming toddlers clamoring at the chance to get a hold of a mist-filled model of Mars.
Visitors, who file through the facility in a slow and steady stream, can’t help but feel something different here than, say, the museum or an amusement park. They still see many of the landmark’s original details, like a bronze plaque at the entrance, which reads: “No smoking, please. The smog is bad enough.”
It’s this kind of polite optimism that makes stargazing so appealing, despite the decline in public interest in space exploration. Little boys have dreams of driving nice cars, not of becoming astronauts. But, even after man has touched the moon, people still look to the sky for answers.
Public membership organizations like the Planetary Society help support those interested in astronomy — and the organization started in the Los Angeles area. The Society’s associate director, Charlene Anderson, explained that to gaze upwards as an innately human quality.
“It’s something in our nature that looks up and tries to figure out what those lights are … There’s some sort of emotional response when you go out in the dark and there’s lights up in the sky,” Anderson said in an interview a couple hours after NASA’s LCROSS satellite crashed into the moon in a mission to find lunar ice.
The mission is NASA’s latest news-making endeavor in space exploration.
Friday morning’s scientific display did not have the drama that stargazers hoped.
“The light was very dim,” Anderson said. “People were disappointed with what they could see … It was not a Hollywood special effects explosion. It was unfortunate it was portrayed that way.”
Though Anderson noted that no Angelenos can see the full wonder of starlight in the middle of the city, she reasoned that, luckily, the surrounding mountains and the desert allow people to see just how powerful starlight can be.
The culture has changed, however, since the Society’s founding in 1980. New generations don’t view space as an unattainable final frontier; they’ve seen plenty of interplanetary battles on TV already.
“Science has become a political battlefield,” Anderson said. “Once we could impress people with the awe of the universe. They aren’t into that anymore.”
Nevertheless, locals still continue to flock to the Griffith Observatory on lazy Saturday afternoons — maybe because there is no charge for general admission. Or perhaps its the drive up to the looking point passes some spectacular views of the LA basin.
Whatever the reason for their visit, Angelenos still feel the desire to look up  — and they like what they see.

USC running back Stafon Johnson was released from the hospital Wednesday, just 16 days after undergoing throat surgery after a weightlifting accident.
The senior walked to the press conference at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and flashed a smile and a thumbs up to a waiting throng of reporters.
Heading home · Stafon Johnson flashes the “Fight On” sign at the press conference a few weeks after his emergency surgery. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
Johnson still requires a breathing tube and cannot speak or swallow, but his doctors were upbeat about his recovery because of how far the senior has already come since the Sept. 28 incident.
“He has made extremely remarkable progress at this preliminary stage,” said Dr. Ryan F. Osborne, one of the surgeons who operated on Johnson. “We’re happy with his progress and we’re very optimistic for his long-term prognosis.”
Johnson nodded along to the words of his doctors and his mother, Kim Mallory, before his uncle Kregg Anderson read a statement that Johnson typed on his laptop prior to the press conference.
“This is not the end of anything, but the beginning of things to come,” Johnson’s statement read. “I will be back soon.”
Doctors had no set target date for when they will ask Johnson to attempt to speak again. They also had no timetable for a return to football, though Johnson nodded and smiled when the notion of playing again was discussed.
Johnson will return home to rest and begin the rehabilitation process. He will be monitored “on an outpatient basis,” Osborne said, and will be evaluated later in the week.
The day was emotional for Mallory, who stayed by her son’s side throughout his recovery. She thanked fans and friends for their outpouring of support through cards and texts, and also the surgeons who worked with Johnson.
“God couldn’t have put together a better team of doctors for us,” Mallory said.
The weightlifting injury could have been life-threatening to many other patients who lacked Johnson’s spirit and health, Dr. Jason S. Hamilton said.
“His physical stature and his will to survive allowed him to make it to the hospital,” Hamilton said. “When I first evaluated him, I was surprised he even made it to the hospital at all. That’s a testament to him fighting from the beginning.”
Johnson has remained in his teammates’ thoughts during his absence. Starting on Saturday against Notre Dame, USC will wear helmet stickers that read “Sta Fight On 13,” a play on words thought up by USC coach Pete Carroll.
Separating himself from the team has proven difficult for Johnson, even during his recovery. The Compton native watched USC’s 30-3 win against Cal from his hospital bed and couldn’t help but get excited.
“He was pushing in bed like he’s Allen Bradford trying to get a touchdown,” Mallory said. “The whole time, it was like he was in the game, but from afar.”
Johnson drew support from throughout the community and even rival UCLA fans after the incident, and continues to gain supporters.
“I wasn’t a football fan before, but I am now,” Osborne said. “You can’t help it. Stafon is just infectious.”
Before heading home, Johnson scribbled a final note for Mallory to read to the audience. She said it read, “Fight on. Beat the Irish.”

The USC men’s tennis team will take the courts at Pepperdine University today for the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Regional tournament in Malibu, Calif.
The tournament will provide several Trojans with an opportunity to qualify for the ITA National Indoor tournament that will be held in November. No. 3 senior Robert Farah and No. 18 sophomore Steve Johnson secured a spot at the National Indoor Tournament when they each reached the semifinal round of the All-American Tennis Championships last weekend in Tulsa, Okla.

“It’s another fall tournament and it’s important and it’s kind of strange now that Robert and Steve aren’t going to play singles, but I think we’ll do great,” coach Peter Smith said.
No. 3 doubles team Farah and Johnson, however, will team up once again for some doubles action this weekend in Malibu. Last year Farah and Johnson left the tournament with a doubles title after defeating Pepperdine’s Omar Altmann and Bassam Beidas in the championship match. As with last year, the duo enters the tournament as the No. 1 seed.
Johnson said he feels more prepared after last weekend’s tournament.
“Absolutely, it’s all about getting matches. You can’t have match play in practice. It’s hard to recreate that in practice,” he said.
Johnson also said that he and Farah are hopeful that this year will be a repeat of last, and the pair will walk away champions.
“We’re seeded one so we should win the tournament, but I thought we played really well even though we lost at All-Americans,” he said.
The Trojans will be experimenting with other doubles combinations this weekend. No. 49 junior Jaak Poldma and sophomore Daniel Nguyen will team up as the No. 4 seed. Senior Jason McNaughton will pair up with freshman JT Sundling. All three Trojan doubles pairs have a bye in the first round of the tournament.
Nguyen has been playing with Sundling lately, but Smith is anxious to see what this new combination will bring.
“I know how good JT and Daniel are together, I’m curious to see how good they are away from each other,” Smith said.
Set to compete in the singles tournament are Poldma, Nguyen, McNaughton, Sundling, junior Daniel Gliner and sophomore Ben Lankenau. McNaughton made it to the round of 16 last year before being eliminated.
This year Smith is counting on McNaughton to step up and show what he can do.
“I’m hopeful that Jason McNaughton can kind of get rid of his rust. I know what a great player he is,” Smith said. “He had surgery and so he’s battling a few things.
“That’s what’s so great about athletics, everybody has their own story so you want to see them do their best,” he added.
No. 5-seeded Poldma, No. 9-seeded Nguyen and Sundling have byes in the first round. Lankenau will face off with UC Irvine’s John Kazarian at 10:30 a.m. Gliner will match up with UC Santa Barbara’s Devin Nerenberg at noon and McNaughton will take on Cal Poly’s Rob Foy at noon as well.
The teams participating in the tournament include Arizona, UCLA, University of San Diego and UC Irvine. Overall, it’s a chance for the Trojans to face off with the local competition, something Smith said he believes is important.
“It’s always interesting and special to play close by with the competition you’re going to face the most,” Smith said.
Doubles matches are set to start up at 9 a.m., with singles play beginning at 10 a.m.

This weekend’s match up between No. 6 USC and No. 25 Notre Dame always has a lot of hype to it, and it should.
The game is a battle between two schools with arguably the country’s most prestigious college football histories.
Each program has racked up 11 national championships, and both have had incredible players in college and in the NFL.
So, despite USC’s recent dominance over the Fighting Irish, the match up continues to have a lot of hype. It might be the greatest intersectional rivalry in college football based on past glory alone.
But because the game is getting so much hype this week and because of other big stories – like the return of Ronald Johnson and the match up between USC’s great passing defense going against the best passer in college football – one story is getting pushed to the side.
And that one revolves around Aaron Corp.
In summer, the redshirt sophomore quarterback probably circled this game as one of the biggest of the season. It’s not every day a quarterback gets a chance to lead his team to a victory in South Bend, Ind.
But a lot has changed in just two months.
It’s been a 2009 season filled with highs and lows for Corp. And on Monday, perhaps, Corp may have hit rock bottom.
Redshirt junior quarterback Mitch Mustain took all the snaps with the second-team offense during Monday’s practice, this following a Saturday scrimmage in which Mustain received ample playing time and converted 10 of 12 passes for 141 yards and two touchdowns.
Corp, on the other hand, completed only two of three passes in the scrimmage. The coaches barely gave him any playing time.
The message was clear: In a season of disappointments so far, Corp was demoted yet again – this time to third string.
“[Mustain] is a little bit ahead right now,” Carroll said Monday. “Mitch has just done really well. He feels way more comfortable. He’s throwing the ball consistently.”
So two months ago, Corp expected to head the offense against Notre Dame this Saturday. And as of last week, Corp expected to take the field if anything happened to true freshman quarterback Matt Barkley.
But now, neither of those scenarios is the case.
If anything happens on Saturday to Barkley, Mustain, not Corp, will be the one marching onto the field.
It’s hard to imagine that just a short time ago, Corp was on top of the football world, ready to lead USC’s offense for the 2009 season.
He was slated as USC’s starting quarterback after winning the job out of spring practice. The position seemed secure, especially because Carroll had never changed his mind before about his starting quarterback after spring.
But an unfortunate incident occurred on Aug. 10. During practice, a lineman rolled onto Corp’s left knee. An MRI revealed Corp suffered a small crack on the head of his left fibula, and he would be out for three weeks.
That’s all the time Barkley needed to take the starting job away from Corp.
But, it wasn’t long until Corp had one more chance to shine. After Barkley suffered an injury to his throwing shoulder during USC’s victory over Ohio State, Corp was once again put on center stage.
It appeared that he finally had an opportunity to start a game, or did he?
Despite Barkley’s injury, Carroll refused to name a starter until minutes before game time against Washington. Corp, rattled or not by the indecision of his coach, played awful in the game, as USC lost 16-13.
In his chance to show the world why he deserved to start, Corp failed. He completed only 13 of 22 passes against an inferior defense, threw an interception and continually threw into heavy coverage.
Was the loss entirely his fault? No, but fans needed a scapegoat. Many couldn’t believe this was the same player Carroll had picked as his starting quarterback in the spring. And many couldn’t bear the thought of Corp starting another game.
Barkley returned the following week, and Corp was pushed back into his backup role.
And now, he is backup to the backup.
“Mitch has just elevated his play,” Carroll said. “He’s in position to get in the game a little sooner than Aaron this next time out.”
Throughout Corp’s descent, he has said all the right things, such as the game is about competition and that he’s willing to help the team any way he can.
But going from first to third has to be tough to swallow for anyone.
“Looking back, I was given a shot, and I didn’t perform,” Corp said.
At this point, who knows when the next time Corp will be able to step back on the field. It certainly looks like Barkley has the position locked up for this season and beyond. And with Mustain now ahead of Corp on the depth chart, there’s little chance for Corp to see action even during garbage time.
So although there is a lot of hype about the game this weekend between USC and Notre Dame, there isn’t much hype about Aaron Corp.
It’s probably not how he envisioned his trip to South Bend this summer.
“Soft Hands” runs every other Thursday. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or email Jon at jhaber@usc.edu.
Corp, bow your back and keep your head up.  You’ll get another shot one day. You’ll make them believers again.

Dear prospective applicant of the University of California class of 2014,
What do you want to be when you grow up?
A successful businessman? Lawyer? An engineer perhaps?
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
All solid choices, no doubt.
But before you answer, you should know that your decision will have a huge impact on your time at any of the 10 esteemed and nationally respected public campuses in our UC system.
Not so much in the sense that you’re probably thinking, though.
Obviously, deciding on a major is an important decision that will help guide you on your scholarly pursuits during your college years. In fact, you’ll probably go through no less than four different college preparation books in the time leading up to your first steps on campus, hoping to find a way to simplify the process. We get it.
But as important as your choice of major will be for obvious reasons, it’s an even bigger issue than you think because of tuition variation.
Let’s get real here. We at the UC system need money. California recently cut approximately $18 billion in funding for public schools and colleges.
Eighteen billion.
Do you know how many iPod nanos that would buy?
Because of this sizeable decrease in funding, we’ve had to raise tuition prices and let go of some of our well-respected faculty members. In fact, your older brothers and sisters have been quite vocal about their displeasure with these measures, standing next to their professors to skip out on their exorbitantly pricey classes to protest.
But mind you, this proud coalition of Golden State institutes of higher education won’t just stand pat and let this budget snafu ruin the quality learning experience of our students.
So we’ve found a new way that will help to offset the loss of state funding — y­­ou pay.
Just kidding. (But seriously, don’t decide to major in business or engineering.)
Look, we only want the best for our students, and upper-level business and engineering professors aren’t just a dime a dozen, nor do they cost a dozen dimes despite what their paltry paychecks may suggest. Therefore, we keep them, but wouldn’t need to do so if you weren’t so insistent on fulfilling some lifelong goal of being some flashy businessman or engineer. So if it’s anyone’s fault, it’s going to be yours.
Now, you may be thinking to yourself, “This doesn’t sound fair at all. Why should I have to pay more than my peers just because I want to pursue a difficult vocation?”
Just think of it as an investment toward your future. Many of you will already be paying a substantial amount of your tuition via financial aid. What’s another $900 or so? It’s like putting a feather on top of the straw that broke the camel’s back. Besides, you’ll be able to pay it back in no time, assuming that the job market makes an astronomical improvement by the time you graduate.
But don’t worry.  If things don’t get any better soon, we’ll have an indiscriminate system of making all undergraduate majors pay extra fees.
Let’s try to make sense of it by relating it to some other situation.
Say you go to the ice cream store with a playmate of yours; you get a chocolate cone, and your friend gets a vanilla cone.  They’re both the same basic ice cream cone, but because you chose chocolate, you have to pay more.  Why?  Because everyone knows that vanilla is the most boring ice cream flavor ever; you are more likely to be a livelier personality compared to your bland friend, and are at greater risk of getting injured and thus unable to repay the 50 extra cents for ice cream that you were charged.
Actually, I suppose that seems like a stretch.
So why should engineers and business students be singled out?
Because these professions have a proven track record of being able to provide recently graduate college students with a decent salary, unlike, say, video game design majors.
But don’t worry. If things don’t get any better soon, we’ll have an indiscriminate system of making all undergraduate majors pay extra fees.
Surely, this can’t be good news for anyone. With many college students taking longer than four years to graduate as it is, making you pay more for certain subjects only compounds the situation. What do you want us to do about it? We’ve been backed into a corner.
While the UC system comes out looking like the bad guy in this situation, we’re just making do with the remnants of a budget we have left.
Why then, should you think about coming into the University of California system?
Because above all, we still have one of the best public university systems in the country, even if “public” is more private than the words “public school” might imply. And though you may be scared off by such radical policies, it might not be long before they’re implemented all across the country. Take the opportunity to be a trendsetter.
Don’t think of this letter as a warning so much as an open invitation to mull over your options in the next decade.
Because there doesn’t seem to be any other defense other than complete transparency, we’ll just hope that honesty will allow you to overlook the glaring deficiencies in our education budget.
To us, you’re not just another number.
You’re a very tangible set of dollars and cents.
Sincerely,
The UC system

It’s so funny while pathetic that you’d even bother to waste your time to comment on an article that’s “nonsense.” Geez, I guess it struck a nerve with you because it must be true, Ivan. We Trojans don’t care what goes on at the U.C. schools, but the idiot who wrote this article apparently does. No, we don’t all dwell on the football culture. You’re just as stupid for thinking that from your lack of  first-hand experience. That’s the 90s and prior, and besides, it’s a bonus to be part of a school with an elite football team.
The “SC joke” manifests your lack of equanimity. Fight on there, Mr. “political activist hippy.” We got better things to do here at ‘SC, like pull the strings of capitalism so that servants like you can whine about the bleeding-heart liberal agendas they instill in you at Cal.
Stumbling on your silly news page to see if it is centered around ideas OTHER than sports… I find this article.
Is USC so insecure about its poor image in the educational and professional fronts, that the students have the need to write these pathetic excuses for excessive use of boring words and condescending attitudes of superiority?
We the people of the University of California Berkeley are a proud people. We are a noble people. We take our educations seriously. If we the Golden Bears of the University of California, Berkeley, have the need to protest to show our power as a collective unit of five thousand strong in protest, does that not make us more human than the mere Trojan trying to look down upon us? Is civil activism not a way of speaking up for our beliefs? I am sorry that USC educates students to be intellectually numb, but my mind is not something to be suppressed. Keep talking away with your silly little remarks: my education might be filled with 500 student auditoriums, lack of commodities, but remember this: a degree from UC Berkeley will always be looked at with higher regard and value than one from USC.
We at UC Berkeley boast a community of students-scholars, socio-economically advantaged and disadvantaged alike, who are not afraid to raise our voices. We support our professors who decide to take in salaries below what the private sector offers – because we respect and honor them. We do this because we know they teach at our universities, not for the economic aspect, but because they see the dynamic found in our UC campus not easily replicated by schools such as USC or others across our bay for that matter. If we decide to walk out of our classes in solidarity with our professors, it is not to merely “skip.” We took a stand for our beliefs. One day of material put aside in class will not jeopardize our academic standings, nor will it be (sadly for you Trojans) consequential enough to change our position in the educational front, and place USC above. Therefore, the next time you try to create an analogy about vanilla and chocolate, try to do your research. Some people like vanilla and some prefer chocolate. If you wish to not pay for the UC Berkeley chocolate  – fine go to the USC ice cream parlor… BUT, when that chocolate from the ice cream parlor tastes cheap and you realize they ripped you off by filling you with commodities such as a superficially pleasant site not that core of amazingly rich chocolate available at UC Berkeley, remember you have no one but yourself to blame.
The budget cuts have not deterred the exchange of ideas going on between us – the students and the professors – if anything: it has brought us together in plight. If I could have my Berkeley education for what I have to pay and push through… or have a free education at USC… you know I’d go to Berkeley for the academic challenge USC will never come close to replicating.
Fight on young Trojans, immerse yourselves into the football culture of your school. After all, what else is there to do in USC? I would much rather be known for being on reuters.com for a five thousand strong march, than on the New York Times for being and intellectually numb football school. If anything, those stimulating minds found in your university are there because of the financial incentive – but never because of the education available. If your school is as amazing and superior as you think it is, that you have to talk down about my educational institution, then why have some of your professors migrated to Berkeley? If Berkeley is as bad as you make it to be, why do we have professors from Columbia vying for spots in the faculty? In short, I leave you with these words… What is USC? Nothing but football and intellectually unstimulated minds. What is the University of California, Berkeley? A place to push your mind into the next level of intellectualism.
A friend once told me this joke: What do a condom and a degree from SC have in common?… You’re better off without one.
Somewhere along the lines… This article makes me agree with the joke.
Long live Troy.
Your Civil Servant,
Ivanicholas.
I challenge you to not remove this post if you Trojans are ready to man up to the truth.

As the race for California governor heats up, the Daily Trojan has yet to cover any candidate other than San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom. By covering one candidate and ignoring all others, a newspaper tacitly issues an endorsement for that candidate by suggesting that he is the only one worthy of space on its pages.
If there is a candidate who is far more newsworthy than another by virtue of his geographic location, relationship to the readership or some other characteristic, it is understandable that he might win more attention from the outlet.
Nonetheless, several likely candidates must be included in stories about political campaigns, in the interest of fair reporting, contextualizing and providing all relevant information to the reader.
After publishing two decidedly positive stories about Newsom’s gubernatorial candidacy earlier this month, Daily Trojan editors need to address why these proclamations of support — and no other coverage of the 2010 California governor’s race — made it to print.
With the Nov. 2 election still more than a year away, Newsom was just the second Democrat to announce his candidacy after California Lt. Gov. John Garamendi. Still, current attorney general and former two-term governor Jerry Brown leads the polls (by 20 points according to the latest field poll) as the most likely Democratic nominee.
In the Oct. 1 article, “Newsom already gaining a strong student backing,” it should have been mentioned that despite the conception of a student support organization, Newsom could face serious competition in the primary.
The Republican side, although not the most immediate rival at this point in the campaign, should also have been recognized. Former eBay Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman, former Congressman Tom Campbell and state Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner are all viable candidates.
Editor in Chief Alexander Comisar attributed the omission to a temporary lapse in judgment.
“In the story we should’ve acknowledged the status of the other candidates in the race,” he said.
Newsom has been recognized for his particularly strong social media outreach that in some ways mimics the strategy used by President Barack Obama’s campaign to target young voters.
But other candidates’ absence does not nullify the news worth of Students for Gavin Newsom, Comisar said.
“Newsom is the only candidate making a splash on campus in terms of student support. We felt like the showing they made and the support they were trying to garner warranted coverage,” he said.
Also of concern is the participation of two editors in promoting the Newsom campaign.
One editor works directly for the campaign. His job at the Daily Trojan does not allow him to affect editorial content, however, nor make the type of decisions that could have influenced coverage of the candidate.
The other participant, an officer for the USC Students for Newsom organization, was not allowed proximity to the Newsom coverage. Because their involvements did not have any direct effect, their names are not included here.
Editors said they plan to continue following the race.
“It’s absolutely necessary to give students a familiarity with the people who are involved in this all-important race for California,” Comisar said.
Hedging his promise to broaden coverage, Comisar argued that candidates who actively reach out to the university community will inevitably be a more visible part of the story.
“As the candidates get more serious about coming on to college campuses and courting the student vote we’ll be there to cover everything that we deem to be relevant to our campus discourse,” he said.

Life is unfulfilling. You go to class or work and try to get something done. You grout the spaces between your chunks of obligation with lesser obligations: errands, research, meetings, chores. Any excess room in your schedule is cluttered with attempts at relaxation: socializing, grooming, YouTube-ing, book reading or just zoning out.
But in spite of your packed agenda, it often feels like something is missing. And then, in a flash of blinding recognition, you realize that Dan Brown held the last piece to your satisfaction all along.
Best seller · The Lost Symbol is the third Dan Brown novel centered around fictional symbologist Robert Langdon. The thriller, which takes place in Washington, DC, is already the fastest selling adult novel in history. - Photo courtesy of Randomhouse
The third installment in the life of protagonist Robert Langdon, The Lost Symbol catapults audiences into a world where Washington, DC is a Masonic mecca and one middle-aged Harvard symbology professor trumps even the CIA in his ability to save our nation from peril.
Lured on false pretenses to the capital by security threat Mal’akh, iconographer Langdon watches helplessly as his keynote-speech evening is warped into a quest to appease a terrorist by the unwelcome appearance of human sacrifice in the Capitol rotunda. The CIA, the Freemasons, Mal’akh, and old acquaintance and noetic scientist Katherine Solomon all vie for the symbologist’s attention in decoding the legendary Freemason pyramid. Meanwhile, the clock ticks down for Peter Solomon, Katherine’s brother and father-like mentor to Langdon.
As the swatch of text heading his novel labeled “FACT” reveals, the Masonic underpinnings of DC, the field of noetic science and the Smithsonian Museum Support Center all exist. The Smithsonian safeguards more than 30 million historical artifacts — and fictional Katherine’s research. Much like in his two prior New York Times’ best sellers, Angels and Demons and The DaVinci Code, Brown aggregates thorough background research with his literary parallel universe.
This habit provoked some defensive talk from the author in his Sept. 15 interview with Matt Lauer on the Today Show.
“I do something very intentional and specific in these books,” Brown stressed. “And that is to blend fact and fiction in a very modern and efficient style — to tell a story. There are some people who understand what I do, and they sort of get on the train and go for a ride and have a great time, and there are other people who should probably just read somebody else.”
For those who can tolerate his liberal play on history, Brown’s intellectual triumph in The Lost Symbol mirrors his writing style; the uncertainty of what is real and what is Brown’s brainchild taunts readers, inspiring them to hurtle on and discover the truth for themselves.
This mechanism of teasing, delaying revelation and dropping just enough clues to keep audiences hastily flipping through his pages is central to all Brown’s novels, and makes for addictive tomes that easily absorb 10 hours of your life in one sitting.
Brown knows how to write popular literature, and for someone who originally moved to Hollywood to become a pop musician, it’s not all that surprising that he packages a lucrative product. (Doubleday printed 5 million copies of The Lost Symbol banking on this very skill.)
But Brown clearly wants his book to be more than a page-turner.
“I’ve thought a lot about life,” he told Lauer. “And I’ve spent a lot of time studying history and science. The theme of this book has a lot to do with the power of our thoughts. And I have great hope for the future and try to nudge the future with this book in certain directions.”
While evidence that the novelist TIME magazine placed in its 2005 list of the 100 most influential people worldwide has a conscience is reassuring, Brown’s big epiphany in The Lost Symbol falls short of expectations, given the climactic climb preceding it. With the loftiness of religious doctrine, Brown invokes his personal realizations in print, attempting to quell years of religious dissent with some conventional logic.
Brown’s novel, however, does unwittingly tap into something bigger than himself. His nuanced understanding of human curiosity might ensure that his books fly off vendor shelves, but it also is a testament to something that does unite us all: the need for something more entertaining than our daily lives.

The No. 9 USC men’s golf team registered its best finish of the year at The Prestige at PGA West tournament but left its coach wanting more.
The Trojans finished the tournament tied for fourth with UCLA at 8-over 872, but the high finish did little to ease USC coach Chris Zambri’s frustration with his some of his players’ early struggles.
“I’m not happy with our finish because we have guys in our lineup who are not playing their best golf,” Zambri said.  “When you’re 20 you should be getting better every year and playing the best golf of your life every year, and we have some guys right now who aren’t doing that.”
Part of what frustrated Zambri is his team’s continued inability to beat teams ranked higher than them.  The Trojans have finished behind a team ranked outside the top 25 only once this season but have also failed to beat the top teams in their tournaments.
“We still got beat by the best teams in the field [this week],” he said.  “We just need guys to play up to the expectations that we have for them and if they do that I really do think we are one of the better teams.”
No. 17 TCU blew away the field at The Prestige with a blistering 14-under 850.  The Horned Frogs finished 16 strokes ahead of the runner-up, No. 4 Stanford.  No. 3 Washington finished third at 5-over 869.
Zambri said USC has to start winning tournaments if it wants to take the next step as a team.  Beating only the opponents it should beat is not enough anymore.
“After a while you start saying, ‘Well this isn’t a coincidence it’s just who we are,’” he said.  “We have to get better so when we have what we think are semi-off weeks we finish second, not fifth or seventh.”
One player who finally played up to his coach’s expectations was sophomore Steve Lim, who finished tied for third at 4-under 212.
“He did everything well and he played like I thought he was going to play this year,” Zambri said.  “I think it’s just the start of some really good things because so many parts of his game are really solid.”
Lim had played poorly in the first two tournaments this year before putting it all together last weekend, thanks in part to some new equipment.
“He didn’t play a lot of tournament golf over the summer and he also showed up with a driver that didn’t fit,” Zambri said.  “He’s got a driver now that fits him great and he drove the ball really well.”
Lim was also pleased with his finish but credited Zambri more than his new clubs for his improvement.
“Coach Zambri is a great coach,” Lim said.  “He’s a tour veteran, he’s played golf almost 30 years and he knows a lot about golf.  He really has good ideas for all of us [as individuals].”
One particularly long talk with Zambri helped the sophomore get his season on track.  Lim said he expects to build on his latest performance going forward.
“It boosts my confidence for the next tournament,” he said.  “I feel great right now.  It can’t be any better.”
The rest of the team might not feel the same way.  Freshman Martin Trainer played solid golf for the third consecutive tournament but finished tied for 18th at 3-over 219.  Fellow freshman Sam Smith tied for 37th at 8-over 224.
Junior Matthew Giles continued his early-season slump by finishing tied for 42nd at 9-over 225.  The returning All-American has placed outside the top 30 in each of his last two tournaments.  Junior Bo DeHuff tied for 47th at 10-over 226 in his first tournament action of the season.
The rest of the USC golf team also played in the tournament as unattached entrants.  Junior Daniel Park tied for 14th at 2-over 218 while freshman T.J. Vogel and Stewart Hagestad finished tied for 31st and 42nd, respectively.

A decade ago, Rabbi Dov Wagner and his wife Runya began
holding weekly dinners in a small, one-bedroom apartment on Vermont Avenue with only five members.
Today, their group — Chabad — includes more than 100 members and is run from the 6,000 sq. ft. Chabad House just off the Row.
Mazel Tov · Rabbi Dov Wagner founded Chabad with his wife, Runya Wagner, 10 years ago. Chabad is a traditional, family-run Jewish group. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
The Wagners founded the group with the goal of offering USC’s Jewish community an opportunity to practice their faith in a more traditional manner, naming it Chabad — a Hebrew acronym that translates to wisdom, understanding and knowledge.
“Our goal was to try to bring the joy of Judaism to Jews on campus, in every level of Jew that they may be,” said Runya Wagner, a religious director at the Office of Religious Life.
Since its inception in 1999, the group has grown to become one of the major Jewish institutions on campus. Despite the expansion, the Wagners say their aim was always to run Chabad as a close-knit group with a focus on the religion’s core ideals.
“We run things a little differently … We do things more traditionally and it’s a family-run group,” Runya Wagner said. “We make sure individuals are still able to benefit from experience through personal attention and opportunities.”
When the group began, it offered just one class teaching members about aspects of Judaism. In the initial years after the founding, growth was slow, as some students were hesitant to join in Chabad’s events because of its reputation for being conservative.
“We faced students with preconceived notions of who we may be, a traditional Jewish couple,” Dov Wagner said. “But people are realizing now that we offer opportunities for every level of Jew.”
Today, Chabad offers students 11 different weekly classes on various Jewish topics, and also regularly hosts guest speakers, Friday night Shabbat dinners and community service opportunities. They also continue to celebrate holidays in the traditional fashion.
“Students … want to know there is a strong Jewish presence on campus and want to be a part of it,” Runya Wagner said.
The relative increase of Jewish students on campus — Dov Wagner said the proportion had increased from about 7 percent of USC’s student body to about 11 percent in the last 10 years — also contributed to the expansion of the club.
“We have seen an influx of Jews coming to USC, and those that do are more involved,” he said. “We have been reaching more and more students on campus.”
A number of those who have attended the weekly Shabbats and participate in the activities said they appreciate the family-run aspect of the group.
“They are a vital part of the Jewish community. It’s a home away from home,” said Noa Oldak, a sophomore majoring in anthropology. “They never impose any aspect of Judaism onto you.”
Ben Mitnick, an alumnus who was a member of Sigma Alpha Mu, a fraternity of Jewish men, said Chabad’s flexibility gave him a convenient way of practicing his religion while also being involved in other activities.
“The group is very welcoming to fraternities, it allowed the members to express their level of Judaism as well as maintaining their practice but also maintaining the social and philanthropic aspect[s] of Greek life,” Mitnick said.
This Friday, the group will hold the annual Shabbat 500 — a special version of a weekly dinner event meant to bring people together to celebrate Judaism.
“We’re trying to get as many Jews and non-Jewish students to learn about Jewish heritage,” Runya Wagner said. “We try to get the different Jewish organizations on campus together for one weekend and many students who don’t usually participate, do come around to Shabbat 500.”
The “500” in the title reflects the number of attendees Chabad hopes to attract. The group is hoping to have attendees from the other Jewish groups on campus, including fraternities and sororities.
“It’s the biggest Shabbat for the students on campus. It’s a great way to have a big dinner with other Jews,” said Eric Kawalsky, a sophomore majoring in electrical engineering and member of Sigma Alpha Mu.
In December, Chabad will officially commemorate its 10th anniversary by holding a banquet at the Galen Center.
“Supporters and alumni will get a sense of where the organization is and motivate them to be engaged and involved to continue to grow,” Dov Wagner said.
The group hopes to build on its success by adding activities and expanding its network to include alumni as well.
“We have so many Jews on campus that we hope to get involved and we also want to keep in touch with alumni and create activities for them which will then create networking and opportunities for students,” Runya Wagner said.
Dov Wagner echoes this goal for overall growth.
“We want to keep up with all the events,” said Dov Wagner. “We want to keep that home feeling but to grow and be able to keep excitement.”
Glad all the great work and relentless dedication the Wagner’s have given is finally being recognized!
The Wagner’s are such amazing people. They opened their home to me (I’m not Jewish) and many others and welcomed us wholeheartedly, offering wisdom and guidance, not to mention the great food and overall wonderful atmosphere at Chabad. I appreciate everything they do for me and other students and thank them!
The Wagner’s are the nicest people that i have met. As a non-jew i always feel welcome to come to the Chabad house are partake in Jewish activities and learn about Jewish Culture. Chabad is a great place to meet people and make new friends, I thank the Wagner’s for all that they done for me and making feel as if i was part of the community :)
A great article highlighting the wonderful work that Chabad has done.  This organization has made a deep impact on the students involved and always actively engaging students who are not yet involved to simply provide them with a joyous Jewish experience.  The amount of energy and time the Wagners dedicate to the students of USC is remarkable and it is great to see that this article is recognizing their achievements over the past decade and congratulating Chabad on their growth and success.
Kudos!
Of course a personal thank you for all that Chabad has done for me and for being a family on campus and a home away from home.
“It is absurd to think that religion would in any way be involved with promoting injustice, apartheid, or oppression.”
Is that your convenient explanation for the Crusades, the Salem witch trials, colonization of continents by European, American slavery/Civil Rights opposition, and currently the Israel-Palestine conflict?
It is absurd to think that religion would in any way be involved with promoting injustice, apartheid, or oppression. Everyone knows that Judaism is about peace, love, and fellowship! That’s why it pays to an informed Jew and get to know Chabad’s Rabbis who dedicate their lives to reaching out and helping others – regardless of race, religion, nationality, or affiliation. Keep up the great work, Chabad!
it’s interesting that this article doesn’t mention chabad’s pro-israel activism, which has alienated pro-justice and pro-palestinian jewish students on this campus. should religion really be involved in promoting injustice, apartheid, and oppression? absurd

USC running back Stafon Johnson was released from the hospital Wednesday, just 16 days after receiving throat surgery for a weightlifting accident.
The senior walked to his press conference at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and flashed a smile and a thumbs up to a waiting throng of reporters.
Johnson still requires a breathing tube and cannot speak or swallow, but his doctors were upbeat about his recovery because of how far the senior has already come since the Sep. 28 incident.
“He has made extremely remarkable progress at this preliminary stage,” said Dr. Ryan F. Osborne, one of the surgeons who operated on Johnson. “We’re happy with his progress and we’re very optimistic for his long-term prognosis.”
Johnson nodded along to the words of his doctors and his mother, Kim Mallory, before his uncle Kregg Anderson read a statement that Johnson wrote on his laptop prior to the press conference.
“This is not the end of anything, but the beginning of things to come,” Johnson’s statement read. “I will be back soon.”
Doctors had no set target date for when they will ask Johnson to attempt to speak again. They also had no timetable for a return to football, though Johnson nodded and smiled when the notion of playing again was discussed.
Johnson will return home to rest and begin the rehabilitation process. He will be monitored “on an outpatient basis,” Osborne said, and will be evaluated later in the week.
The day was emotional for Mallory, who stayed by her son’s side throughout his recovery. She thanked fans and friends for their outpour of support through cards and texts, as well as the surgeons who worked with Johnson.
“God couldn’t have put together a better team of doctors for us,” Mallory said.
The weightlifting injury could have been life-threatening to many other patients who lacked Johnson’s spirit and health, Dr. Jason S. Hamilton said.
“His physical stature and his will to survive allowed him to make it to the hospital,” Hamilton said. “When I first evaluated him, I was surprised he even made it to the hospital at all. That’s a testament to him fighting from the beginning.”
Johnson has remained in his teammates thoughts during his absence. Starting on Saturday against Notre Dame, USC will wear helmet stickers that read “Sta Fight On 13,” a play on words thought up by USC coach Pete Carroll.
Separating himself from the team has proven difficult for Johnson even during his recovery. The Compton native watched USC’s 30-3 win against Cal from his hospital bed and couldn’t help but get excited.
“He was pushing in bed like he’s Allen Bradford trying to get a touchdown,” Mallory said. “The whole time, it was like he was in the game, but from afar.”
Johnson drew support from throughout the community and even rival UCLA fans after the incident and continues to gain supporters.
“I wasn’t a football fan before, but I am now,” Osborne said. “You can’t help it. Stafon is just infectious.”
Before heading home, Johnson scribbled a final note for Mallory to read to the audience. She said it read, “Fight on. Beat the Irish.”

Program Board is one step closer to realizing their goal of bringing a high-profile, instantly recognizable speaker to USC.
At Tuesday night’s Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting, Program Board’s Speakers Committee received approval for its funding request of $7,000.
The speaker’s name still cannot be released due to contractual obligations, but Beibei Bai, director of the Speakers Committee, said she anticipates the event will attract a wide range of students and will contribute to USC’s ability to bring similar public figures to campus.
“This speaker is really high profile in his industry, and it would push the events we put on to the next level,” Bai said at the meeting. “Basically, he’s going to talk about his experiences. We have a lot of [communication], journalism and business students, and that would definitely appeal to them.”
The speaker is scheduled to come to campus in January.
Several senators were initially concerned about giving a large portion of the Senate allocations fund to this event, but many said Program Board’s successful track record with similar events alleviated their anxiety.
USG Vice President Ashlie Chan said she supports the Senate’s decision to grant Program Board’s funding request.
“[Program Board] has done this for so many years, so they know how to gauge what’s worth it and what’s not. They’re thinking about it and not just frivolously asking for money,” she said. “Seeing how much experience they have, I think it’s worth it.”

David Huebner, a USC lecturer at the Gould School of Law, has been nominated as the new US Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa by President Barack Obama.
A member of the Sheppard Mullin & Richter LLP law firm, Huebner is no stranger to international affairs.  He currently resides in Shanghai as a partner resident, and he heads the firm’s China Practice and International Disputes Practice.
Though Huebner has not been at USC for the last two years, his involvement with Gould has had a lasting effect, said Deborah Call, associate dean at the law school.
“He helped us when we began our [Master of Laws] program,” Call said.  “He introduced us to a network of high power attorneys to promote our program and attracted a great number of students into our program from the Asia-Pacific region.”
Huebner is also general counsel for the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, has previously chaired the California Law Revision Commission and served as president of the Los Angeles Quality and Productivity Commission.
Brian Hebert, a member of the CLRC who worked with Huebner, spoke highly of his time as chair.
“He was an excellent commissioner,” Hebert said.  “The work we do is complicated legal analysis and he was always very well prepared.  As a chair, he was very effective and good at keeping everyone on task.”
Hebert said he thinks Huebner will do will in his new role as ambassador.
“He makes people from different backgrounds feel included and heard,” Hebert said.  “I think that’s important in a diplomatic position.”
Call also thinks Huebner will have a lot to bring to the table as an ambassador.
“What he offers is not only depth of experience as a seasoned attorney, but he’s very familiar and well traveled,” Call said.  “His expertise in international affairs, his work as an educator, and all of that combined will bring a lot to his position as an ambassador.”
Having a member of the Trojan community in this international position will also benefit USC, Call said.
“We have a great opportunity to have him work and teach here,” Call said.  “I think it will enhance the relationships [USC] seeks with global partners around the world.”
