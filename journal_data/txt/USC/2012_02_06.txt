Mikey Geragos and Vinnie Prasad are running to be the Undergraduate Student Government’s president and vice president, respectively, on a platform of “making students’ lives easier.”
Election 2012 · Vinnie Prasad and Mikey Geragos have both served as senator pro tempore. Geragos currently serves as USG’s director for university affairs. - Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
Geragos, a junior majoring in public policy, management and planning, currently serves as USG’s director for University Affairs. Prasad, a junior majoring in psychology and economics, serves as a residential senator and is speaker pro tempore for the Senate.
“Vinnie and I have the same reason for running,” Geragos said. “We both love this university so much, and we wanted to give back during our time here. Both of us saw USG as being that way to give back.”
Geragos and Prasad said the primary platform points they want to push are ensuring adequate funding for philanthropy, sustainability and service organizations; increasing the availability and publicity for free LAX shuttles; combining USG and Campus Affairs calendars into a mobile application; and increasing outreach from USG to other organizations.
“We’ve heard people say USC is very compartmentalized socially,” Geragos said. “We’ve been to dozens of organizations already to learn about what they need and care about. Ultimately, we’re here to support them, not just do the things we think are best.”
Geragos and Prasad said they plan to stay connected to the student body by increasing senator outreach to clubs and organizations and by making a few Senate meetings each year more interactive and more like the forums USG has co-hosted with various departments.
“Technically the Senate meetings are open to the entire student body, but obviously most people don’t have the time to attend all those meetings,” Prasad said. “We’d like to have big meetings more frequently, maybe monthly, that allow for students to voice their opinion and learn more about what USG is doing for issues they care about.”
Looking ahead, Geragos said his administration would respond to the increasingly residential campus by adding to the number of events on campus, partially through Program Board, which gets its funding from USG.
“The more programming you have on campus, the more it feels like a residential community,” Geragos said. “We want to make sure that they’re not ignoring the fact that students have social lives and the interactions between students to student.”
Prasad said students have input in the Specific Plan, USC’s guidelines for changing or interacting with the area around the University Park Campus, because of the increase in residential housing.
“That should be something students regularly have a voice in. It’s something constantly in fluctuation,” Prasad said. “We’re just as motivated as administrators are on this issue because we want the school to be better 10 years from now.“
Prasad also said USG and USC must stay on top of technological trends to communicate with students.
Geragos was speaker pro tempore as a Greek senator last year, for which he won USG’s Senator of the Year award. He has been on the Society 53 board for two years and has served on Sigma Chi’s executive board. He currently is on the General Education review board and the Sustainability Board. Last year, he won the Tommy’s Student Governance Award for leadership in multiple organizations.
Prasad was assistant director of community affairs and a building government chair for University Residential Student Community. He has been a residential adviser for two years and is treasurer for the Trojan Knights. Last year, he won USG’s Emerging Leader Award.
“We have the passion and drive to take this position on full force,” Geragos said. “I’ve known I wanted to be president since I stepped on this campus. If that dream gets realized, I won’t take it for granted.”

Celebrating its 125th anniversary, the nearby St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Church parish has played an integral role in the USC community.
Anniversary · St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Church, located on the corner of Figueroa Street and Adams Boulevard, is celebrating its 125th anniversary as a parish this year. The church, which works closely with the university, was constructed in 1925 with a donation from Edward L. Doheny, who also donated the Doheny Memorial Library. - Woodrow Clark | Daily Trojan
Built in 1925 as a gift from USC donor Edward L. Doheny, St. Vincent de Paul, located on Figueroa Street and Adams Boulevard, has played an active role in the USC Catholic community as well as the surrounding neighborhood.

The church provides opportunities for USC students to get involved in the larger community through partnerships with organizations like JEP.
Brother Tony of St. Vincent de Paul Church has worked for 27 years at the church and said the church’s connection to USC over the years has strengthened in a variety of ways.
“Our association over the years with USC includes students working with the family of schools in our neighborhood that USC helps sponsor,” Brother Tony said. “Students come to masses and hold services through the USC Caruso Catholic Center throughout the year. Houses on The Row during Christmas time come and sponsor families in our communities who need assistance with meals and gifts.”
Brother Tony said, as an organization, the church works with USC on a number of different boards aimed at improving the larger community, and he has seen the neighborhood change in response to these partnerships.
“As a member of the Figueroa Corridor along with USC, we work to bring cooperation and services between the neighbors and community,” Brother Tony said.
Father Lawrence Seyer, pastor of USC Caruso Catholic Center, said St. Vincent de Paul has provided many opportunities for students to get involved in the neighborhood.
“Students from the Catholic Center teach confirmation there,” Father Seyer said. “It’s a way to give back to the community. Also the Society of St. Vincent de Paul looks after the poor and provides a number of services to the local community. They work with people in need and find them the help they need.”
Because of the construction of the new USC Catholic Center, St. Vincent de Paul has provided a larger parish for students to participate in.
Amanda Schubert, a sophomore majoring in business administration and cinematic arts, said St. Vincent de Paul provides opportunities for Catholic students at USC to practice their faith and to serve the community.
“It’s nice to have the church so close by with our Catholic center under construction,” Schubert said. “It’s another community of parishioners and a way for students to connect with the neighborhood.”

Keck School of Medicine of USC announced last week that researchers discovered a stem cell that can be used as an effective cell model to study the virus that causes Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, the most common type of cancer AIDS patients can contract.
Before the discovery, there was no viable cell model that scientists could infect with the virus and still keep it living to study its transformation into a cancerous cell, according to Shou-Jiang Gao, head researcher and a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology.
“We now have an in vitro cell culture model and in vivo tumor model that allow us to dissect the molecular mechanism by which KSHV manipulates the cellular pathways leading to the development of KSHV-induced malignancies,” Gao said.
KSHV causes blood vessel tumors, which cause noticeable red spots that look like rashes on the skin. Treatments for KSHV include surgery to remove the tumors, chemotherapy or antiviral drugs.
According to Gao, researchers at Keck have been working on this project for several years and have been screening primary cell types, including those from humans, mice and rats.
Keck will use this model to study several characteristics of KSHV and to find a better cure. With this new cell model, researchers will be able to study viral genes and cellular pathways that KSHV targets. Researchers will also be able to identify new therapeutic viral and cellular targets for KSHV-induced malignancies and conduct preclinical studies to test new therapeutic approaches for KSHV-induced malignancies. KSHV has become an increasingly dangerous disease for patients affected with AIDS, Gao said.
Before the AIDS epidemic, KSHV rarely occurred in the United States with an infection rate of two out of every million, according to the American Cancer Society. It is now estimated that a person infected by HIV has a 20,000 times greater risk of developing KSHV compared to people who do not have HIV.
With the development of new treatments for AIDS in the United States, KSHV now occurs at a rate of about seven cases per million people. Men can get KSHV much easier than women, and it is rarely seen in children. It is also more common in the United States for African Americans to contract the disease than Caucasians, according to the American Cancer Society.
It’s too bad the Keck School of Medicine doctors don’t spend as much time with out patients. From my experience they very much more concerned with publicity and raising money. I am a graduate and supporter of the Universitu of Soithern California

USC moved to No. 1 in ESPN’s Top-25 Preseason Poll, released Monday. Previously ranked No. 2, USC ousted LSU from the No. 1 spot.
With a solid recruiting class, featuring three five-star athletes, the Trojans went for quality rather than quantity on their way to next season. The Trojans’ national signing day results made heads across the country turn.
Recruits like wide receiver Nelson Agholor, defensive back Devian Shelton and defensive end Leonard Williams boosted the caliber of this year’s class of 15 recruits, adding depth to a relatively small number of incoming players.
The three five-stars, Agholor and offensive linemen Zach Banner and Jordan Simmons, will be crucial in ensuring a strong offense, something USC worked on steadily last season.
The Trojans average a star rating of 4.07, according to Rivals.com.
Regardless of the scholarship restrictions that went into place this recruitment cycle, USC remained appealing to some of the top players in the country — 10 four-star players were among the 15 total recruits.
Though seven months still remain before the team’s season opener, the poll indicated USC’s nine returners on the offense and defense, combined with strong new recruits, puts it in a spot to compete for the BCS national championship title.
With the return of junior quarterback Matt Barkley and junior wide receiver T.J. McDonald and the arrival of new players,  things are certainly looking up for a team that was unable to compete in bowl games for the last two seasons.
Polling right behind USC are the Alabama, Louisiana State University and Oklahoma. USC is the only Pac-12 team ranked in the top five, with Oregon ranked No. 6 and Stanford at No. 13.
The Trojans will begin spring practice on March 6. They are set to play six away games and six home games next season, beginning with Hawaii on September 1.
One problem…T. J. McDonald is a defensive back NOT a WR.
Its GREAT 2B a Trojan in 2012.
Fight On!
Would be nice if article mentioned all 13? or is it really 15 recruits.
Also the 2 big guys that Got away…and chose The Farm!!!
Fight On!

Pam and Paula McGee, two All-Americans and national champions for the Women of Troy, will have their jerseys retired at halftime when USC takes on UCLA at the Galen Center at noon on Feb. 19.
Among legends · Pam and Paula McGee’s jerseys will be immortalized with other Women of Troy greats on Feb. 19. Before the McGees, just three women’s basketball players had their numbers retired. - Courtesy of USC Sports Information
The two sisters were integral pieces of USC’s back-to-back national championship teams in 1983 and 1984, and both have their fair share of accolades and statistical records.
Pam McGee ranks second all-time in total rebounds with 1,255 and sixth all-time in points with 2,214. During her four years at USC, she averaged at least 14.8 points and 8.6 rebounds each season and went to the WNBA as the second overall pick in the 1997 draft. On the international stage, she helped the country earn a gold medal in the 1984 Olympic Games.
Pam McGee was inducted to the Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame on July 23 last year, joining four other Women of Troy with the honor. She was also the first WNBA player to have her son play in the NBA. JaVale McGee currently plays for the Washington Wizards.
Her sister, Paula McGee, ranks fourth all-time in scoring with 2,346 career points. She jumped out to a fast start with her collegiate career, averaging 20 points and 9.2 rebounds as a freshman. Paula McGee rounded out her collegiate career, averaging 18.4 points per game alongside 9.1 rebounds. She also holds the record for second-most field goals made at 993 and third-most blocked shots at 190.
After the WNBA, she started a sports management agency and represented her sister, Pam, in the WNBA. She now operates Paula McGee Ministries and is an ordained Baptist minister.
The sisters will join Cynthia Cooper-Dyke, Lisa Leslie and Cheryl Miller as the only Women of Troy with retired jerseys in the Galen Center.

Football season is over and basketball is less than a month away from post-season play. Now it is time to focus on America’s pastime: baseball.  The 2012 USC baseball season is around the corner. The Trojans are preparing to take the field at Dedeaux on Feb. 17 and have their eyes fixed on Omaha, Neb. — a goal most believe to be nearly impossible for the USC baseball program.
Rise of Troy · With the help of returners like redshirt senior Andrew Triggs, USC’s recruits will push the baseball program to new heights. - Carlos Acenas | Daily Trojan
Led by coach Frank Cruz, the Trojans are primed to make a run for the Pac-12 title and, most importantly, improve upon last season’s lackluster record.
In the offseason, USC has made significant moves to regain the respect it deserves. Not only did USC’s athletic director Pat Haden hire Cruz full-time in May 2011 after Cruz served as interim head coach for nearly two seasons, but the Trojans have also signed an impressive 2012 class.
USC boasts a remarkable class of 2012 enrollees. In fact, it is the highest rated signing class for the Trojans in the past decade. The 19-man class consists of seven pitchers and 12 position players. Of the signees, several were drafted in the 2011 Major League Baseball draft.
The 2012 class is a great addition to the already outstanding USC roster. Though losing key players, like infielder Ricky Oropesa (drafted by the San Francisco Giants in 2011), the 2012 USC roster will have the perfect mixture of veteran talent and young blood.
Of the enrollees, USC signed left-handed pitcher Stephen Tarpley, outfielder and first baseman Ryan Garvey, right-handed pitcher Wyatt Strahan, third baseman Trent Boras and infielder Dante Flores.  The Trojans also signed two-time draftee and senior transfer right-handed pitcher Martin Viramontes on the 2012 enrollee roster.
The 2012 class joins returning starter, right-handed pitcher Andrew Triggs, who was 5-4 in 2011 with a 3.67 ERA. Triggs allowed opponents 94 hits last season. Outfielder Garrett Houts is back for the 2012 season. Houts hit .324 during Pac-10 Conference play in 2011. Both Triggs and Houts provide leadership qualities, something that is vital to lead the Trojans to a conference title and, ultimately, the College World Series in Omaha.
USC has not won a national championship in more than a decade — the last win occurred in 1998 under coach Mike Gillespie. It might seem hard to believe, but USC has all the pieces it needs to vie for a championship. Young talent, veteran leadership and solid coaching are all intact for the Trojans.
With that said, it is not far-fetched to fantasize about the rise of the USC baseball program. Though other advertisements for athletic teams contain the obligatory message about the revival of a program, the USC baseball team without a doubt deserves just as much respect and publicity as the other athletic teams on campus.
The resurgence of USC baseball is imminent and this prophecy could very well come true in 2012. Break out the sunscreen and baseball caps, ladies and gentlemen, Baseball season is here.

Again not on top of the situation. Ryan Garvey has left the team and school believe at semester break in
December to enroll in Junior College. You left out two top returnees in catcher Kevin Roundtree and shortstop
James Roberts in your article. First and main item of business this season is to make the ncaa tournament
 and maybe host a regiona on Dedeaux Field!.

Sophomore two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist scored five goals to lead the Women of Troy in two convincing wins in the final day of the Stanford Invitational on Sunday, as the squad claimed third place in the tournament to start their season.
USC concluded the weekend with a 10-5 win over No. 2 Cal to clinch the third-place game, just hours after routing No. 14 UC-Davis 13-6.

The Women of Troy dominated a pivotal second quarter against Cal, outscoring the Golden Bears 4-1 to take a 6-2 lead into the locker room at halftime.
They continued that pace in the third period to take an 8-3 lead, having held the Golden Bears to one goal in each of the first three periods.
Gilchrist recorded a hat trick against Cal, and freshman driver Monica Vavic scored two goals. Sophomore goalie Flora Bolonyai held steady between the posts, racking up seven saves.
UC Davis hung close with the USC for the first half of Sunday’s opening match, staying within 6-4 at halftime.
But USC woke up in the third quarter, outscoring UC Davis 4-1. The Women of Troy added three more goals in the fourth period for a final score of 13-6.
Gilchrist, Vavic and juniors two-meter Patricia Jancso and driver Chelsea Silvers scored two goals apiece to lead USC’s balanced attack.
Bolonyai recorded three saves before giving way to senior goalie Morgan Vickers halfway through the fourth quarter.
USC went 3-1 overall in the tournament, beating No. 5 San Jose State 14-6 before narrowly falling to No. 1 Stanford 8-7 on the first day of play.
San Jose State and the Women of Troy were tied 3-3 after the first period, but USC exploded for 10 goals in the next two quarters to pull away from the Spartans.
The Women of Troy spread the wealth around in their first official game of the 2012 season, as 10 different players scored against San Jose State. Three freshman — Vavic, 2-meter Eike Daube and driver Savannah Fletcher — scored their first career goals.
In Saturday’s nightcap, USC took its first loss of the season against No. 1 Stanford after falling behind 5-1 by halftime.
The young squad, which has three seniors on its roster, fought back valiantly in the second half, but fell short against the top ranked Cardinal in its home pool.

The classic theater production A Raisin in the Sun, written by the late Lorraine Hansberry, is running at the Kirk Douglas Theater in Culver City. The original play debuted in 1959 and was the first play written by a black woman to be produced on Broadway.

At the age of eight, Hansberry and her family moved to a primarily white neighborhood where they were constantly harassed by neighbors. In protest, Hansberry learned to fight segregation at a young age and was inspired to write.
Directed by Phylicia Rashad, this piece illustrates the racial and economic peril many blacks faced during the ’50s, an issue that still resonates today.
Unlike other plays, A Raisin in the Sun does without fancy special effects, staying true to the time period with an authentic, simple set and strong acting that ensures the narrative is the focal point.
Set in the south side of Chicago during the 1950s, the play follows the lives of a black family, the Youngers, in their pursuit of the American Dream.
When the play opens, the Youngers are awaiting an insurance check for $10,000 from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each adult member of the Younger family has his or her own idea as to how to use the money. The matriarch of the family, Lena Younger (Kim Staunton), wants to buy a house to fulfill a lifelong dream that she and her husband shared before his passing. But Walter Lee Younger (Kevin T. Carroll), Lena’s son, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store he believes will solve the family’s financial problems.
One of the most impressive things about the show is the talented ensemble’s ability to recognize the depth of each character and to embrace their emotions to take their characters to the next level.
Carroll has appeared in various Broadway shows (Angels in America), and here he truly captures the intense frustration and uncertainty Walter Lee is experiencing when attempting to invest in a risky business deal. He eloquently communicates the inner struggle Walter Lee is enduring while attempting to change his circumstances.
But even those with less experience shine. Newcomer Kenya Alexander portrays Beneatha Younger, the younger sister who dreams of becoming a doctor. Alexander excels in her role as an outspoken Afro-centric 20-year-old, and her outrageous antics and comedic timing adds a unique mixture of seriousness and comedy to a complex role.
In the role of Lena, Staunton gives an impressive, bold performance. Though the character is not as multifaceted and emotionally complex as others, Staunton brings experience and charm to the role.
Deidrie Henry stands out as Ruth Younger, a young wife burdened with the responsibility of trying to keep the family together while managing her own personal issues. Henry gives an impressive performance as she takes the role originally portrayed by acclaimed actress Ruby Dee and gives it a new and energetic perspective that audiences will find entertaining.
Smaller roles are also executed expertly. Scott Mosenson plays Karl Linder and does a marvelous job portraying him, speaking with a self-righteous undertone that makes his performance believable.
Amad Jackson and Jason Dirden also excel in their roles as Beneatha’s persistent suitors Joseph Asagai and George Murchison.
Rashad’s direction gives thematic meaning not only to the characters but also to all aspects of the play.
The Youngers’ home setting, for instance, is used to symbolize the galvanizing force that keeps the family together.
And the lighting cleverly changes with the mood of the scene, adding to the realism of the play. Even the details are on point: The actors are perfectly dressed for the time period, which, combined with their acting, creates an atmosphere that feels genuine.
A Raisin in the Sun takes a beautifully executed look at the hardships that many black families faced during the segregated ’50s. It’s inspiring to see that, despite all the obstacles the characters face, hard work and family unity keeps them focused on achieving the American Dream. In fine form under Rashad’s direction, A Raisin In the Sun continues to be a literary treasure that is crucial in illustrating an appalling period in American history.
 
A Rasin in the Sun is running at the Kirk Douglas Theatre in downtown Culver City through Feb. 19. For more information visit the Kirk Douglas website at CenterTheatreGroup.org.

If you happened to watch NBC on Sunday, you might have noticed a sporting event that  was going on in the interim between on-air promos for the network’s highly touted mid-season launch of a new scripted series called Smash.
The media blitz has been relentless in the months leading up to the official broadcast premiere of the show, a fictional account of the making of a Broadway musical about the life of screen icon Marilyn Monroe.
In every respect, NBC seems to have gone all-in on Smash, and that includes casting: Boasting an ensemble consisting of an Academy Award-winner (Anjelica Huston), an NBC alumna (Will & Grace’s Debra Messing), an American Idol sweetheart (Katharine McPhee), real-life Broadway veterans (Megan Hilty and Christian Borle) and big-name guest stars (Uma Thurman and Nick Jonas), Smash proves that, with Steven Spielberg executive producing, anything — including the booking of a Jonas Brother — is possible.
All of it’s enough to make a person wonder if NBC Entertainment Chairman Bob Greenblatt was trying to reassure himself more than trying to convince reporters when he said that Smash was not “make or break” for the struggling network, which is currently languishing in fourth place behind CBS, Fox and ABC.
But he’s probably right. Despite a decade of positively subterranean ratings, it’s hard to imagine a world in which NBC — the network that brought viewers The A-Team, Sanford and Son, Seinfeld and Friends — doesn’t have at least some semblance of cultural relevance.
If anything’s on trial here, it’s the small screen musical.
Since Smash was introduced, the inevitable comparisons between it and Glee have touched on the shows’ nominal similarities — Singing! Dancing! — while generally painting Smash as Glee’s sophisticated older sibling. Greenblatt simply fuels that notion by maintaining the spirit of the show that was initially developed as a pilot for Showtime by the premium cable network’s then-president of entertainment. But pitting the shows against one another misses the point: With any luck, history will show that both programs played instrumental roles in reigniting America’s dormant love affair with the musical.
For any and all who might be skeptical that such a time ever existed, simply look to box office records and Billboard charts of yesteryear to see that exports from Broadway — cast recordings and film adaptations alike — were once not merely bigger deals than they are today, but crucial components of the pop cultural vernacular.
At 54 weeks, the West Side Story soundtrack, for instance, holds the record for the most consecutive weeks as the No. 1 album on the Billboard 200. While in the film arena, movie-musicals, such as Grease, Chicago and Hairspray, have often proven indisputable box office hits, holding the top spot for weeks at a time. As inconceivable as it might seem in 2012, songs from musicals often went on to become honest-to-goodness radio hits, consumed and craved by the masses.
But is it really hard to believe? In a world where at least one Glee cover song is all but guaranteed to number among iTunes’ top downloads at any given time, there’s clearly at least a segment of the American TV-watching populace that doesn’t squirm to think of the incorporation of musical-like qualities into primetime television.
As a matter of fact, the criticisms most frequently lobbed by Glee detractors — namely that the show is inhabited by caricatures rather than characters and that it awkwardly lurches from one top-40 hit to another, instead of pursuing an intelligible story arc — aren’t so much indictments of the TV musical format as they are shortcomings in Glee’s own execution.
Obviously, Smash isn’t a musical in the conventional sense. The show’s qualities as a backstage drama could make for a fresh angle to keep viewers coming back week after week.
But those same meta attributes might end up being Smash’s saving grace for another reason: People who are averse to the idea of characters spontaneously bursting into song do exist. But because Smash makes Broadway its subject, and therefore the bulk of songs will be apropos of the fictional Marilyn musical being put together, audiences may well be more inclined to accept the singing.
If the small screen musical is to have any hope of taking off, Smash represents its best shot. And because it’s hard to imagine Smash resorting to Glee-like gimmicks, to a certain extent, everyone involved with the show is banking heavily on the hope that the promise of classic storytelling and original music will prove enough of a draw for small screen audiences as well.
So whether it was America that was tired of musicals, or musicals that were tired of America, isn’t important. The reality is that, after nearly three seasons of Glee, audiences are perhaps as primed as they’ll ever be to accept the idea of music taking on a bigger role on TV, beyond providing the backing soundtrack.
Call it a good, old-fashioned American sense of entitlement, but I believe TV audiences have long deserved the song and dance and spectacle that was once all but expected at the movies. There’s a lot riding on Smash being a smash, and not just for NBC: It might determine if we’re left singing “Bye, Bye, Birdie” or “Hello, Dolly!” to our erstwhile love, the musical.

In a time when most superhero stories come swaddled in plastic predictability and giant budgets, sometimes a messier, rougher film comes as a refreshing relief.
Found footage · Andrew Detmar (Dane DeHaan) comes into his telekinetic powers in Chronicle, a film that takes an unusual cinematographic approach, as much of the film is shot by Andrew himself. - Photo courtesy of EPK.TV
Chronicle, directed by Josh Trank, takes the superhero origin story and drags it through the tumultuous mud of high school life. Though Chronicle is not a pretty picture, solid acting and a simple story make the film a fun alternative to typical hero fare.
Chronicle operates under the “found footage” conceit made popular through movies like Cloverfield. Though security cameras and other sources come into play, most of the footage is shot by the main character, Andrew Detmer (Dane DeHaan).
From the start, Spider-Man’s Peter Parker looks like an argyle-wearing sissy compared to Chronicle’s lead.
Andrew spends most of his day suffering through a bully-filled school, taking care of his dying mom and evading his alcoholic deadbeat dad. He seems like the child who would one day flip out and stab someone — he’s not someone you would want to develop telekinesis and to be able to fling cars around.
Andrew’s world changes when he, his cousin Matt (Alex Russell) and his cousin’s friend Steve (Michael B. Jordan) explore a hole in the ground and stumble across a magic crystal object whose origins are unclear. Soon after, the three boys develop nose bleeds and, more impressively, telekinesis.
Chronicle poses a fascinating theoretical scenario: What would happen if boys barely old enough to drive developed superpowers? At this point, our Heroes-meets-Cloverfield flick becomes Heathers-meets-The Blair Witch Project.
The boys take to the skies, dodging airplanes and planning trips to Hawaii. They scare little girls in Wal-Marts and torment teachers by moving their cars. Essentially, they act like teenage boys. And like teenage boys, they throw epic temper tantrums.
Andrew, still feeling alone and neglected, begins to realize he’s a newborn Nietzschean Übermensch. As expected, the fun telekinetic romps come to an end and things get nasty.
The human element of Chronicle stands out as its most distinct feature. The characters feel like people we knew in high school rather than caricatures. One can believe their silly antics because of all the stupid things that people really did in high school, even if real life didn’t involve running cars off the road or pitching policemen through the air.
The actors work well together, possessing believable, earthly charismas similar to those of the actors in Paranormal Activity. Refreshingly, the film does not revolve around romance or coming-of-age tropes, unlike the MTV-esque The Covenant from a few years back.
The “found footage” idea gets a burst of artistry thanks to the childrens’ psychic powers — Andrew learns to levitate the camera, allowing for swooping shots and less shaky camera work. Shots in Chronicle, however, lack the inventiveness of other “found footage” films, such as Paranormal Activity 3’s oscillating fan trick.
Thankfully, the film’s cinematography doesn’t suffer from negative Cloverfield comparisons: The boys’ adventures, such as their first time flying, stay in blissfully plain sight.
Trank does a lot with his $15-million budget to make the CGI and special effects impressive.  The telekinetic antics, from car tipping to sky-high football, are the best part of the film. The nagging question of how someone assembled the “found footage” — and why the government hasn’t seized it — remains unanswered, but at this point the audience can just reason that telekinesis must have intervened.
Chronicle’s main flaw is a lack of pathos. Though the movie satisfies on a mental level, it lacks a solid emotional core. The boys entertain, but it’s hard to feel bad when their lives fall apart: the audience feels interested rather than captivated.
And though the crazy climax draws positive parallels to the seminal anime Akira, which also featured telekinesis and questions of morality, Chronicle falls very short of the visceral fury that made Akira famous.
The film is fun, but not compelling. This stumble might come down to the main characters — though amusing and well-acted, they aren’t likable or written well enough to be genuinely intriguing. It’s interesting and funny to see Andrew, the main character, lose it, but it’s not saddening.
Chronicle won’t rival The Dark Knight Rises or The Avengers for superhero hot pick of the year, but it’s a scrappy endeavor and an action-packed morality play about the downfalls of hubris.  Much like a teenager’s raging hissy fit, Chronicle isn’t particularly momentous, but it is quite fun to watch.

Fun fact: If you type “fast food desert” into the Google image search bar, an image of Figueroa Street pops up.
The three-block stretch of Figueroa close to USC contains virtually every fast food chain imaginable.  We live in a fast food desert: healthy dining is hard to find, and it is often very far away.
When the Ronald Tutor Campus Center opened, it seemed logical that it would be stocked with the healthy dining options that are so scarce in the surrounding area.
Though USC did install several healthy dining options, it also brought more fast food closer to USC students.
Carl’s Jr. and Panda Express already exist less than a mile from USC, yet both opened new locations in the campus center. California Pizza Kitchen also opened its doors within the new center. Salads at CPK average around 700 calories, and all pizzas average more than 1,000 calories.
In contrast, Seeds Marketplace’s salads and sandwiches seem to be healthy, but that assumption can’t be verified. Nutritional information isn’t available for any of them.  The USC Hospitality website says that it will be posting nutritional information for all USC restaurants by spring 2011, but only a few restaurants have been updated.
The nutrition section of the USC Hospitality website acknowledges that “it can be difficult to find time to eat, much less eat healthy.”
As a solution to this, “many USC Hospitality venues located all across campus carry ‘grab and go’ items such as salads, fruit cups, sushi and wraps/sandwiches.”  But even these “grab and go” items are often far from healthy. Salads are mixed with super-fatty dressings, and even yogurts and fruit cups can contain a surprising amount of calories.
In USC brochures and advertising, USC students always seem to be healthy, happy and fit. But is this becoming less of a reality? Many of us continue to eat terribly, although USC touts more nutrition information — information that is either ignored or not presented in a format that garners attention.
Last fall, USC launched an Immigrant Health Initiative to focus on improving nutrition and health among immigrant groups.  Currently, many immigrants who move to the United States see an increase in their risk of cancer and other chronic diseases, according to the National Cancer Institute.  This decline in health is inevitably linked to the poor nutrition that has come to characterize America.
How can USC launch an initiative to help immigrants while continuing to feed junk to its students, especially during this time of skyrocketing obesity?
Some good nutritional information is available on USC’s Hospitality website, but it is buried within the website in an unorganized fashion.  Nutrition has clearly taken a backseat in USC’s priorities.
Moreover, students should be better educated about nutrition. There are students at USC who essentially never eat vegetables — how do things like this happen?  Solid nutrition is the basis of a healthy life, and even small steps would be an improvement, such as making the nutritional information for Seeds available.
Rather than mimicking the surrounding community and installing more fast food venues, we need to see more healthy options made available. USC does little in terms of bringing in local or organic food.  As a result, many USC students travel five miles to nearby Urth Café for organic, fresh food.
Resources are available for those who want help in changing the way they eat. Nutritional advice is available through the health center and through USC Hospitality’s website.   We look to USC to be a leader in many areas — it’s time nutrition became one of these.

Well said, Tim.  I have always thought the same thing.   Month after month, I ask for nutrition information and it has yet to be made available to students.  As a fitness and nutrition enthusiast, I definitely see the need to educate students.  It’s great to see that more and more students are actually demanding nutritional education.  It’s very easy to be deceived into thinking that eating on campus is healthy when in actuality it’s not.

We’ve all seen comics of bathroom stalls featuring people poring over newspapers, but the bathroom might actually be a more popular destination for checking Facebook.
Irene Wang | Daily Trojan
A recent study indicates that 75 percent of the population has used a mobile device while on the toilet — an absurd phenomenon The New York Times nicknamed “The Rise of the Toilet Texter.”
Gut reaction? It’s a little gross, but it’s not unheard of. Toilet texting isn’t so much a problem in itself but rather an indicator of a much bigger, more disastrous trend: Americans are too enamored with their mobile devices.
According to a 2011 Pew survey, about 83 percent of Americans own a cell phone, and 43 percent of those owners have smartphones.
The pressure to stay connected constantly is enormous in the business world, leading lots of companies to issue BlackBerrys as part of their employment packages — or it’s expected their hirees own one already.
For college students, the necessity can feel even more overwhelming. Having a smartphone seems like one of the only ways to adequately manage emails, calendars, homework assignments, concert tickets and, of course, friends.
Texting, meanwhile, is a well-established staple of the collegiate life. It is often the default means of quick communication with parents, friends and significant others.
So where does this leave us? Well, for one, smartphones have created a culture of people who can’t handle being separated from their mobile lifelines for three minutes. According to the Pew survey, a quarter of Americans will not go to the bathroom without taking their phones with them.
Even worse are the people who make unnecessary trips to the bathroom at work or school to check their phones outside of scheduled breaks.
What a waste of their own time — it’s not as if they could do anything substantive in a window that narrow, anyway.
The bathroom situation is the tip of the iceberg. More frequently, mobile devices are injected into scenarios where they don’t belong: dates, dinners out, business meetings and class discussions.
Granted, phone etiquette changes based on the formality of the situation: Your friends aren’t likely to object when you look up an actor’s name while hanging out at Ground Zero, or if you answer a call during a walk across campus.
But nothing is more annoying during an intimate conversation or business discussion than the incessant buzzing of someone’s phone, especially when that person insists on seeing what the buzzing is about.
Constantly checking your phone inevitably sends a clear message to the people around you: They are no more interesting than the digital world in your pocket. In many contexts, this comes across as rude. And your disinterest can also make you uninteresting; you become boring when you are only halfway engaged with what’s going on around you.
The emergence of the Toilet Texter, no matter how laughable, remains a warning sign to all of us who are, admittedly, a little bit addicted to our cell phones.
Whether you send 500 text messages a day or read The Times on your Android while waiting for a table at a restaurant, you should always remember there are times and places where mobile devices aren’t welcome.
Whether or not the bathroom is one of them is up to you, but your boss or your girlfriend’s parents might not be so flexible.
 
Francesca Bessey is a freshman majoring in narrative studies.
If I ever participate in toilet texting it is not because I am addicted to my smartphone. In fact, I don’t even own a smartphone. It would be because I don’t have time to text elsewhere. I don’t approve of people walking or biking while texting because it puts other people in danger. Campus is already dangerous enough as it is. So, where is the hurt in using private time, like going to the bathroom, to text people? Is it gross, yes. But it is not necessarily an indication of an addiction. Lastly, what is the difference people reading a newspaper in print or reading it online on a phone? Absolutely nothing. It’s simply a way to pass time while you get your business done.
I don’t think this article has a base for much of what it was saying.

Campaigning for Undergraduate Student Government elections officially began at midnight with candidates and their volunteers placing signs along Trousdale Parkway.
The three USG Presidential and Vice Presidential tickets — Mikey Geragos and Vinnie Prasad, Jared Ginsburg and Samantha Coxe, and Theo Offei and Julia Riley — also began campaigning online by launching websites.

The websites, www.theojulia.com, www.votejaredsam.com and votemv.com, include each ticket’s platform, candidate biographies and other multimedia. Ginsburg and Coxe’s website includes an animated video explaining their platform. The website for Geragos and Prasad’s website allows voters to sign up for a mailing list.
Several senatorial candidates also placed signs on Trousdale shortly after the campaigning began at midnight.
Ten students are running for three Greek senator positions: Matthew Arkfeld, Alexander Cascante, Katherine Grabar, the slate of Bryan Linnell and David Magnuson, Amanda Martial, Max Mellman, Ryan Park, Janet Shamilian and Michael Yoshimura.
Eleven students are running for six residential senator positions: Josh DeMilta, Teja Henry, Emma Katz, Sheena Khann, Sarah Loh, Li Hsuan Lu, Jasmine McAllister, Stephanie Miller, Adeel Mohammadi, Maheen Sahoo and Sona Shah.
Adam Prohoroff is the only candidate for commuter senator, though there are three commuter senator positions.
Voting for both presidential and senatorial candidates will last from Feb. 14 to Feb. 16. On each day of voting, USG plans to have food trucks, including In-N-Out, available for students who have voted.
Elections coordinator Kelly Hahn said USG is aiming for greater participation in this year’s election. About 5,600 ballots were cast in last year’s contest.
“We have a goal in our head about how many people we’d like to see out voting,” Hahn said. “This year, my personal goal is 7,000.”
In addition to an annual debate between the presidential candidates, which is scheduled for Wednesday at 7 p.m. in Ronald Tutor Campus Center 450, Program Board will host a town hall meeting Feb. 13.
Unofficial election results will be announced Feb. 21, and official results will be reported the following week.

Every Super Bowl party has one: that guy who’s “only there for the commercials.” And probably free beer and nachos. But that guy’s got a point – companies pull out all the stops for Super Bowl Sunday, to convince a massive crowd of roaring sports fans that they need a brand new Chevy or 6-pack of Budweiser.
This year was no different. Some commercials rocked, others sucked, and sadly there were no wardrobe malfunctions at half time. A few highlights:
No game is complete without controversy: the Chevy Silverado ad  drew a big stink on two fronts. Ford, after the ad insinuated people would die from the 2012 Mayan apocalypse if they sped away in a Ford car, threw a hissy fit with NBC to pull the ad. NBC refused. Now the laity is just cranky that a car ad reminded everyone we might die in 2012. Unless we buy Chevys. I can hear the collapse of the Japanese automobile industry.
Clever brevity earns respect in my book. Teleflora’s ad, featuring a sexy woman donning Louboutin pumps, informs the audience they will get laid on Valentine’s night if they buy their partner flowers. Though an amusing ad, I wonder if Teleflora will honor refund requests for Valentines that did not end with woopie.
Dear Coca Cola: maybe next year you’ll just feature a screencap of polar bears with a “drink our sugar water!” caption? Polar bears are cute, but this year’s commercial was bland. A bear needs help getting a drink because his fingers are crossed for the game, so his wifey bear helps out. Simplicity can be endearing but that was just boring.
Another flop was MetLife’s ad, “Everyone.” Why are Scooby Doo and Transformers in an ad with the words “financial security?” Why would I want that stoner Shaggy to be associated with my finances? Next!
Ok, M&Ms, another Super Bowl standard. The nudist M&M was funny, but still not the funniest commercial from M&Ms, even on regular TV.
For me, the Doritos ad was amusing. A snot-nosed kid taunts his granny and baby brother with out-of-reach Doritos. Granny uses her electric wheelchair to sling-shot the baby’s swing and steal the chips. The brat’s look of anguished surprise makes it clear: you don’t mess with Grandma.
No Super Bowl would be complete without a Budweiser ad. Their first offering, “Eternal Optimism,”  is a rehash of American history through the eyes of boozers. No wonder it’s a party. It’s a fun ad. Their second ad, featuring the Clydesdales and the happiness of the end of Prohibition,  struck a more lukewarm note, and doesn’t compare to the adorable puppy one a few years ago.
Bud Light scored cute points with a dog trained to fetch beer. While the ad’s ending message of supporting animal rescue seems to clash with a dog forced into indentured servitude, the image of the dog running on the rolling keg was adorable.
Samsung’s ad fooled me. It started out by hilariously dissing Apple but quickly devolved into people singing off-key and dancing in the streets. Boring! Get back to making fun of the iPhone. Apple’s potential hissy fit makes me shivery.
Another winner was Kia’s ad for the Optima. Though I don’t know why a man would be dreaming about an MMA fighter giving him a come hither look, the rest of the dream – bikini girls, giant sandwiches, and barnstorming his girlfriend’s own lusty dream – had me giggling.
Kia ran neck and neck with Volkswagon’s ad. It was a great mix of weird and funny. It starts off with a dog crash dieting and exercising to lose weight to fit through a doggie door and chase a Volkswagon. It ends with the cantina from Star Wars and Darth Vader choking some fool alien. Did I miss something? Regardless, I laughed.
The Fiat ad was not so stellar. A guy somehow mistakes a Fiat for a sexy woman coming onto him. I don’t think objectophilia makes for a good car ad.
Finally, Dannon’s Oikois Greek Yogurt ad. Close but no cigar. It would have made a fine regular TV commercial, but this is the Super Bowl – a time for juiced up, money-hurling commercials. Spousal abuse over a cup of Greek yogurt just doesn’t cut it. We at least need chainsaws.
I could go on, but YouTube now has all the commercials up for voting. Check them out and see which ones make you want to shell out some money.
Eastwood ad was the best.  Teabaggers hated it, of course.  The polar bears and the flying baby sucked.
I thought most of them were good. I didn’t care for the Clint Eastwood “endorsed” Chrysler ad. Patriotism and 9/11 themes have nothing to do with a car maker that made short-sighted decisions prior to being bailed out by the Gov., and subsequently being bought out by an Italian car company.
A good summary of the ads. This years ads where just not as strong. Thank you for the youtube link

In the weeks following Lana Del Rey’s unpolished performance on Saturday Night Live, critics have run to the press with every reason not to like Del Rey. The evidence used to bolster their point is that she doesn’t write any of her own music, her lyrics are immature, she is the epitome of what happens when people get too famous too quickly, as well as a whole slew of rumors that drag her childhood, family and physical appearance into the ring.
Why then are we still talking about her? The answer is simply that she is captivating. Lana Del Rey has come up with a fresh definition of what a pop star can be, and no one can look away.
Pitchfork wasn’t thoroughly impressed with Del Rey’s debut, but their job is to grade on musical merit not public opinion.
The ultimate disappointment of Born to Die, then, is how out of touch it feels not just with the world around it, but with the simple business of human emotion.
If Del Rey’s debut album Born to Die feels out of touch with the real world, Sasha Frere-Jones of the New Yorker would respond by reevaluating the purpose of pop-music.
The debates that surround authenticity have no relationship to popular music as it’s been practiced for more than a century. Artists write material, alone or with assistance, revise it, and then present a final work created with the help of professionals who are trained for specific and relevant production tasks.
I’m inclined to side with Frere-Jones. Del-Rey is something of a spectacle, and regardless of who is responsible for that creation, it is more fun to enjoy the magical tricks than to spend the whole time trying to figure out how it was done.
Even Liz Phair got in the mix, supporting Del-Rey’s efforts as a female in a predominately male music scene. In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, Phair gave her perspective on the matter of Lana Del Rey when taken in its widest view. Phair wrote:
Let me break it down for you: [Del Rey is] writing herself into existence. She’s giving herself a part to play because, God knows, no one else will and she wants to matter in this life.
Despite her apparent flaws, Del Rey has something interesting to say, and anyone who is too headstrong not to listen is missing out.
