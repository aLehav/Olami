When the NBA announced the indefinite suspension of its season in response to the coronavirus pandemic on the evening of March 12, the world of sports was sent into a frenzy.
Within just 24 hours, professional leagues both domestic and abroad announced similar cancellations with no immediate plans for return. 
On the collegiate level, athletes and staff at USC were forced to press pause with seasons in full swing.
Preparations and travel plans for postseason play were well underway for winter sports, and spring sports had just kicked off. Those involved with USC’s men’s basketball team were either on their way to or already in Las Vegas for the Pac-12 Tournament.
Various USC beat reporters were hustling to keep up at a time when winter and spring sports were in action, spring football had just begun and the annual recruiting cycle was in full swing. 
With the NBA taking such a definitive stance, there was a growing belief within the college sports community that the clock was ticking. 
“Right as spring practice ended, that’s when the NBA [postponed] their season,” USCFootball.com producer Keely Eure said. “I think that, seeing the sports world, a professional sport, suspend their season … it just felt like if professionals are not playing, how are you going to make students play? And so that for me was when it became really serious.”
Eure’s hunch was quickly proven to be accurate, as the NCAA announced subsequent suspensions of competition shortly thereafter.
As for USC’s chief marketing officer, Craig Kelley, things could not have happened at a more chaotic time. Kelley and members of the athletic department staff were in Las Vegas for a busy week of meetings with the Pac-12 Conference and business partners. Kelley said that after initial conversations with athletic director Mike Bohn and others, he quickly became aware that the week’s festivities would not continue as planned. 
From a student-athlete’s perspective, junior men’s volleyball player Cole Paxson said he and his teammates became aware of the severity of the situation following a Wednesday-night matchup with Concordia in Irvine. By the end of the evening, word had spread and players were aware of the NBA’s decision to suspend its season and the potential ramifications the decision would have on their own. 
“I was like, ‘Well, this could have been our last game of the season. That kind of sucks for the seniors if this is it,’” Paxson said. “And then we woke up the next morning, and our coach calls and was telling us that the season was over.”
Paxson said the emotions following the call were primarily those of disappointment and disbelief.
“It kind of hit us pretty hard,” Paxson said. “The next morning, just everything was done like we put in work for the entire year, and then everything’s just gone.”
For Eure, things haven’t been too out of the ordinary from the reporting side of things. She said she has to make slight adjustments to make her technology work seamlessly but that the real difficulty lies in finding stories. 
“There’s nothing we can actually cover, like there’s nothing actively happening,” Eure said. “So I think that’s the biggest challenge: kind of rehashing old storylines or looking into the history of things.”
Kelley’s marketing team has been tasked with trying to find new ways to keep fans engaged in the absence of live sports. While the shift to working from home has been relatively successful, sustaining interest and engagement has been an ongoing battle. 
“The technology side wasn’t that difficult,” Kelley said. “I think the hardest part for us was the removal of the athletic events. It obviously changes the scope of our work.”
For Kelley, although his staff is remote, the priorities are staying consistent. 
“For us, it’s focusing on the 2020 season — getting prepared for that,” Kelley said. “And that’s all sports included.”
Paxson said his teammates have been advised by USC sports psychologists to maintain the routines they had been practicing on campus. Part of that routine is meeting regularly with coaches and teammates, Paxson added, which now happens over Zoom.
“I try to wake up around the same time … and make a good meal and then just try to continue out my day like it’s normal,” Paxson said.
Finding ways to get their fix of sports content has been a challenge for athletes and employees alike with the widespread absence of live sports.  
Eure’s life at home during the pandemic has given her a greater appreciation for the role sports play in her life.
“I think this made me realize sometimes as a sports reporter, you can get overloaded with sports, and you’re like, ‘I just don’t want to see another highlight,’” Eure said. “Now I’m like, ‘Give me any highlights’ … I think my roommate was watching some random Rams game from, like, two seasons ago or something, but I heard the whistles from upstairs and there was something about whistles happening — it was so exciting.”
For Kelley, the most challenging part of quarantine has been helping his two young daughters with their math homework. 
“My kids definitely keep me busy,” Kelley said. “It’s been far more challenging than I anticipated because of the schoolwork side of it, more so than my own job.”
As a sports fan, Paxson has tried to find entertainment by consistently checking in on ESPN programming, but the lack of live sports has made it challenging to find content worth watching.
Paxson, Eure and Kelley all touched on not taking things for granted after seeing how quickly sports can be taken from those involved in them.
Eure stressed the importance of understanding priorities at a time like this. 
“Really valuing your job for what it is, and also just how much your relationships with friends and family are so important,” Eure said. “When you’re going through something like this, everyone really leans on each other.”

For rising sophomore Sabrina Perla, the coronavirus presented both physical and mental obstacles. When she tested positive for the virus mid-March, her mental and physical well-being became inextricably linked; after her hospitalization due to the infection, she experienced a manic episode that led to a bipolar disorder diagnosis.
Perla, who is majoring in business administration, was initially diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety disorder and was prescribed antidepressants in late 2018, which she said were ultimately ineffective. Following her hospitalization, Perla, who also has attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, returned to Los Angeles from her home in New Jersey to access mental health services through Medicaid, a federal and state insurance program that helps cover health care costs for low-income individuals, since her therapist told her she had to be in California to continue meetings. She received an emotional support dog and new medication. 
But even with these resources, Perla said quarantine has only made her mental health worse, making it difficult to maintain a routine and muster the motivation to follow through with daily tasks. 
Perla’s experience is not uncommon. As the world lurched to a standstill as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, millions of people across the United States retreated into their homes. Nonessential businesses shuttered, recreation centers closed and colleges became near-ghost towns. With the mass cessation of activity, many people — particularly those with mental health disorders — lost access to vital coping mechanisms: face-to-face interactions with friends, distractions in the form of leisure pursuits and crucial tethers to their surroundings that encourage them to persevere. 
“It’s been hard to stay home because I kind of need the social interactions to keep me going, keep me happy,” Perla said. 
For students, whose college experience is ingrained with social gatherings — whether through parties, extracurricular activities or academic life — the abrupt end to most in-person interaction can exacerbate feelings of isolation and loneliness. A quarter of those between 18 and 25 have been diagnosed with mental illness, making young adults the group with the highest prevalence of mental illnesses, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.
“[Students are] totally cut off from the social interactions that are the fabric of college life, and that so often are the basis for people’s maturation and growth through the years of education,” said Columbia University clinical psychology professor Andrew Solomon in an interview.  “So I see college communities as particularly vulnerable. I see it as a real responsibility for colleges to recognize this.”
Solomon wrote an op-ed about mental well-being during quarantine for The New York Times in April detailing how the lack of focus on the pandemic’s harmful mental health implications may contribute to a secondary epidemic if public health initiatives aren’t implemented to address the escalating crisis.
A new normal
After the L.A. County Department of Public Health enacted its safer-at-home order mid-March, USC Student Health, along with other health care facilities across the city, switched to TeleHealth visits for routine and wellness check-ins. Students have been encouraged to continue to take advantage of resources, including individual drop-in Let’s Talk … On Zoom! sessions, one-on-one appointments, group counseling and workshops. 
With the switch to teletherapy, some of those at Student Health are now responsible for weekly workshops and talks on coping during the pandemic and maintaining healthy relationships and emotional connections, said Kelly Greco, assistant director of outreach and prevention services, clinical associate professor and faculty of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Keck School of Medicine of USC.
But some students have said they don’t feel comfortable taking advantage of these opportunities since they have moved online.
For Seanna Latiff, a rising junior majoring in art and cinema and media studies, the incentives to seek out treatment for mental health have decreased with the transition to TeleHealth services. Before the pandemic struck, Latiff had been utilizing the counselors’ walk-in hours because the in-person environment made her feel safe and cared for.
Perla, who is seeing both a USC therapist and an outside provider she was referred to by the Engemann Student Health Center, said counseling is no longer as accessible; because more people are now seeking professional mental health resources through the program, Medicaid’s resources are limited, meaning she connects with her non-USC affiliated therapist once a month instead of once a week. Although her counselor has made adjustments in an attempt to meet more frequently since her new diagnosis, she said therapy over the phone is awkward because of the lack of face-to-face interaction. 
Sara Zuluaga Sierra, a rising junior majoring in non-governmental organizations and social change, said the pandemic has tested the adaptability of USC’s mental and physical health offerings.
Part of Zuluaga Sierra’s decision to stay in California rather than return to North Carolina was based on the increased access to mental and physical health practitioners in L.A. Some of these physicians were referrals from Student Health for treatment for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and otherwise specified attention deficit disorder. In addition to outside physicians, Zuluaga Sierra said she has had mixed but overall positive experiences with Student Health services. 
A secondary epidemic
Despite the TeleHealth adjustments undertaken by many offices across the country, including at Student Health, there is no adequate health care framework for dealing with psychological issues prompted by physical catastrophes such as pandemics, according to a 2011 study conducted by the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit global policy think tank. The stressors produced by the unprecedented coronavirus crisis, coupled with the need for self-imposed isolation, disrupts the normalcy of the human experience, Solomon said. 
While Solomon believes local and national governments’ focus on physical health is appropriate given the nature of the pandemic, he is wary of how mental health is often sidelined in public health conversations. 
“I think people will come out of this whole thing … with very, very damaged psyches,” Solomon said. “Being depressed lowers the vitality of your immune response … So on a variety of fronts, this issue of mental health is dangerous to physical health. And of course, mental health is physical health, I mean, these are brain disorders.”
For Zuluaga Sierra, who has been diagnosed with autoimmune conditions, the connection between physical and mental health is personal. Before spring break, she asked Residential Education officials about housing accommodations for immunocompromised individuals. After being given an answer that outlined a case-by-case policy regarding who would be able to stay in campus housing for the remainder of the term, she wasn’t convinced of their concern. 
“And as a person who is sick, we really tried to make it known that just because we’re sick, we’re not expendable,” Zuluaga Sierra said.
But as circumstances quickly evolved, contingency plans for campus residents changed dramatically as students were encouraged to return home, which, according to Zuluaga Sierra, was for the better. 
Unlike students such as Zuluaga Sierra and Perla, who recognized the pandemic’s drastic toll on their mental and physical well-being, people without mental health disorders may be less adept at identifying the symptoms of mental illness and thus less likely to seek out professional help during this time, Solomon said. By contrast, people with preexisting mental health conditions may be more equipped to deal with the crisis because they may already have support networks and are familiar with the cyclical nature of disorders such as depression. At the same time, Solomon said navigating the detrimental mental health implications of quarantine when diagnosed with mental illness is not easy.
“There are many people who have had mental illness and who have struggled with depression and anxiety who are now going to have what gets called a double depression, in which, effectively, their underlying and ongoing struggle is kicked into much higher gear by these difficult and peculiar circumstances,” Solomon said. “And a lot will be people who think, ‘Oh, I thought I was climbing out of that, and now here I am back at the bottom of the pit again.’”
Rising junior Selin Yalcinkaya, who is diagnosed with mixed anxiety and depressive disorder and other specified feeding or eating disorder, said quarantine has stunted the improvement of her mental health. 
“I would say sophomore year for me has been a lot of personal growth and like me kind of shedding bad habits,” said Yalcinkaya, who is majoring in theatre and psychology. “And I feel like since all of this, I’ve kind of taken a few steps backwards, which has been pretty frustrating.”
Yalcinkaya said ever since she’s returned home, she’s fallen back into harmful behavior, such as compulsive exercising and restricting food, as a coping strategy for her anxiety and depression. She said being at home reminds her of negative high school experiences and being around her family triggers additional stress. 
“I think with quarantine, it’s been, you know, obviously everyone’s really stressed out,” Yalcinkaya said. “And so for me that’s kind of manifesting in really negative ways.”
For some students, such as Latiff, quarantining in L.A. was preferable to returning home, where a complicated living situation would exacerbate her generalized anxiety disorder. But with the lack of communication she received from USC about her guaranteed summer housing as an orientation adviser, Latiff grew increasingly nervous. 
“I have a lot of anxiety right now about what’s going to happen to me a month from now, where I’m gonna end up,” Latiff said. “I’ve been reaching out to so many different [University] offices — getting zero responses back.”
Latiff said the silence she received from USC regarding her housing concerns reinforced her belief that the University consistently sidelines mental health. However, she said she understood the communication gap given the rapid way the University has had to adapt to emerging challenges.
For Yalcinkaya, USC’s mental health services have proved to be a saving grace. While she does not currently use the University’s mental health resources, she said her freshman-year Engemann therapist saved her life, counseling her through some of her lowest points that year. Student Health also helped her find an outside therapist that she currently talks with on the phone, although she admitted remote therapy is not as helpful because of the lack of in-person meetings. 
“I feel like we’re kind of all suffering right now,” Yalcinkaya said. “I feel really unmotivated and uninspired, which then makes my mental health worse.”
Zuluaga Sierra’s experience paralleled Yalcinkaya’s, as she mentioned it felt isolating knowing other students on campus were able to complete tasks that she could not on a daily basis during the pandemic. With the majority of her professors conducting class as usual, she felt increasingly alone. 
“The first two weeks were really bad. I was struggling a lot, mentally. I was in a very dark place,” Zuluaga Sierra said. “And my schoolwork was just like, not, it was not getting done … I was genuinely so depressed or so anxious that I could not rise up from my bed, much less look at a textbook or try to write a paper. And so that I think has been the most difficult part, especially because like a large part of my identity is based on being a really good student.”
Transforming care
For Dr. Steven Siegel, the Franz Alexander Chair in Psychiatry and professor and chair of psychiatry and the behavioral sciences at the Keck School of Medicine, mental health concerns have never been easier to address — even amid pandemic — as they have become less stigmatized throughout the years.
“Being in quarantine … might have an augmented negative impact in that people may already be quite isolated before this happened, and the few interactions that they may have, especially when you focus in on people with psychosis, are really their lifeline to feeling valued and valuable,” said Siegel, whose research focuses on those coping with psychosis and schizophrenia, which in different respects can both lead to loss of contact with reality and result in hallucinations or disrupted thought patterns. “It’s also their window into reality checks. And so, when that goes away, it can … reinforce some of their underlying fears that the world is a dangerous place or that they are alone.” 
But for people who have never experienced mental illness, quarantine can foster the development of disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder or depression, Solomon said. 
A 2013 study published by the Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health following the H1N1 outbreak found that of the 398 self-reporting parents that quarantined or isolated during the outbreak, a quarter met the criteria for PTSD. 
“People are living in a state of fear, and they’re afraid for themselves,” Solomon said. “They’re afraid for colleagues. I mean, there are all of these people dying around them. And that’s terrifying.”
As health care providers, both Siegel and Greco recognize that their peers, other health care workers, parents and students who are the primary caregivers in their family find it difficult to balance caring for others along with maintaining their own mental well-being. 
“What I say is reaching out for help is a sign of strength,” Greco said. “We are humans. COVID is something that is new to us. It is a time of uncertainty and great stress. And we have got to reach out to manage the stress with this — we cannot do this alone.”
Taking these groups into consideration, Keck Medicine and USC partnered to launch Care for the Caregiver, a program intended to ease the burdens that have surfaced for health care workers during the pandemic, by providing free housing, essential and comfort amenities and telehealth appointments with therapists from Student Health. 
This program, along with past efforts to broaden access to mental health resources before the pandemic, has transformed the way Keck Medicine and USC will provide physical and mental health care in the future, Siegel said. Not only will TeleHealth continue to be an option for patients that may not be able to be seen in person, but the new student psychiatry practice on the fifth floor of Engemann will work in tandem to increase the University’s outreach and ability to see more patients on a long-term basis.
Both Greco and Siegel said this progress would have been nonexistent if professional advocates for mental health were left out of the conversation. At every level — not just discussions held by the University level — but by state politicians along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization have brought mental health to the forefront.
However, Solomon believes governments’ public health responses concerning the mental health implications of the outbreak have been lacking. Aside from general guidelines on how to manage stress amid the pandemic from NIMH and the CDC, large infrastructural change has failed to be implemented nationwide. Due to the economic effects of the outbreak, mental health providers have had to cut staff, reduce services or close entirely, according to a National Council for Behavioral Health survey of 880 community behavioral health care organizations.
“My concern is that in prioritizing physical health and largely overlooking mental health, what we’re going to achieve is a secondary epidemic that can be just as lethal and just as widespread as the initial one,” Solomon said.
Day by day
Given the isolating nature of quarantine, Solomon said it is of the utmost importance to maintain relationships and a semblance of routine during the pandemic, although the motivation to do so may be significantly decreased. 
“Your lifeline is attachment to and connectedness to other people, and those are things that have to be sustained,” Solomon said. “Keep the essential emotional connections that you have and the friendships that are nourishing you alive, even though it takes a lot more effort to do it right now.”
Greco echoed this sentiment based on her previous talks with students and the research available on group involvement that demonstrates its beneficial effects on mental health. 
“That sense of belonging is a key factor to thrive,” Greco said. “And so, you know, if you think about when you and I get stressed out, one of the first things a lot of us say is ‘So many people carried me through that. They carried me through the loss, the stress. They were there for me unconditionally.’”
During quarantine, people should take care of their basic needs by regulating their sleep schedules and their diet, avoiding excess alcohol, caffeine and drugs, Solomon said. He also said people should attempt to preserve a daily routine, which includes exercise and going outside for fresh air. 
While some aspects of these routines may seem difficult to complete on a daily basis, Greco encouraged students to focus on easily achievable goals because the circumstances are more difficult to contend with.
“You know, it’s little things like going into the grocery store or just going out for a walk — they’re more stressful now these days and harder to do,” Greco said.
For Perla and Yalcinkaya, coping with the effects of outbreak means sticking to routines. Yalcinkaya sets aside time to play the guitar or go outside and spend time with siblings and friends on FaceTime, while each day Perla ensures she takes care of her dog and exercises. 
“It’s OK to ask for resources, it’s OK to ask questions and it’s OK to not to be OK all the time,” Perla said. “A lot of people feel stressed, and maybe they feel things they’ve never felt before, but it’s important to take care of yourself and put yourself first during this time.”

Los Angeles Chargers head coach Anthony Lynn summed it up nicely Friday: “I think sometimes you can do the wrong thing while trying to do the right thing.”
I get what NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is going for, and I believe his intentions are good. 
On Friday, ESPN NFL reporter Jim Trotter reported that the league was proposing rule changes that would boost a team’s third-round draft pick by six or 10 points if it hired a person of color as head coach or general manager, respectively. It also provides a five-spot jump in the fourth round of the draft before that coach or general manager’s third season with the team, should they be retained that long.
The proposal comes just a few months after Goodell voiced his dissatisfaction with the NFL’s Rooney Rule during Super Bowl weekend in Miami. The rule, which requires teams to interview at least one underrepresented candidate for head coaching and football operations jobs, clearly hasn’t had its desired effect: Marginalized groups make up four of the NFL’s 32 head coaches — one of those four being Lynn — and two of 32 general managers.
Goodell knows this is a problem — especially in a league that comprises more than 70% Black players — and at least his new proposal, an addition to the Rooney Rule, seems to acknowledge that the original version isn’t the answer. 
But if only that proposal didn’t bring about its own set of problems in addition to the ones it was meant to address. Because a system in which people of color are treated as tokens is absolutely the wrong way to go about improving diversity, and that’s exactly what the proposal would create. 
While diversity is something that the league and its respective teams should value, it’s not something that should be achieved through incentives. In fact, that runs counter to the very point of diversity in the first place. Hires will no longer be about increasing African American representation in positions of power; they will be about generating the false notion that the league and owners value diversity when, in reality, there are tangible rewards to be reaped off the backs of the marginalized people in these leadership positions. People of color will inevitably be seen as simple figureheads exploited by teams to boost their chances at a sought-after prospect in the upcoming draft, rather than someone qualified for doing the job well.
The tangible effects of the rule change will admittedly be minimal. Teams won’t all of a sudden put someone in prominent organizational roles with tons of power just to improve their mid-draft position by a few slots in hopes of landing their preferred backup quarterback if they feel that a particular coaching candidate isn’t right for the job. But that’s not the issue. 
The issue is that each time a person of color is hired, each time they’re given authority, the narrative surrounding the hire will be the same: “Well, are they really qualified, or do they just want a better draft pick?” Of course they’re fucking qualified. That shouldn’t even be a question. The NFL shouldn’t give anyone a reason to ask it. 
Hell, it might even decrease the number of people of color in prominent roles. Every owner will know that the narrative described in the former half of the previous paragraph will persist; they’ll know that hiring a person of color will lead plenty of fans to scrutinize the organization for using a person of color as a mere tool for obtaining a better pick. Even if that’s never the case, teams won’t want that perception to exist in the first place. So, they may avoid it altogether.
Lynn’s opposition of the proposal hardly scratches the surface of the near-universal disapproval from Black people both inside and outside the league. 
Dez Bryant, a Black free agent wide receiver, retweeted a tweet from Bleacher Report announcing the proposal and remarked, “I’m going to act like I didn’t read this smh.” 
Louis Riddick, a Black former NFL player and current on-air talent for ESPN, added his own thoughts: “If these policies are implemented, the first day I walk into the building, I know people with that organization would wonder: ‘Did he get this job because he’s the best man for the job, or did he get it at least in part because it gives us a big break in the draft?’ On the first day of the job, that team would be undermining its own hire by injecting doubt in the minds of the people who work in the building. Is that how you really want a GM to start off his career?”
Rob Parker, a Black sports journalist for TV20 Detroit and a contributor to Fox Sports 1’s talk show “Skip and Shannon: Undisputed,” weighed in as well: “Somehow, NFL executives think it’s fair to put capable black coaches in the unenviable position of appearing as though they’re not actually qualified, but have their jobs just because of the improved pick.”
The list goes on and on. You get the point — nobody likes it.
Parker raises another interesting issue worth considering: “It’s crazy to think that despite playing football at such a high level, making up roughly 70 percent of the players in the league, that owners would have to be enticed to want black people in their organizations.”
He’s 100% right. He proposes players take matters into their own hands and refuse to sign with teams that don’t extend enough opportunities to people of color. Once owners feel the financial ramifications, they’ll hopefully change. Knowing the general greed of NFL owners and their valuation of money above all else, he’s probably right about that as well, though it is an unfortunate reality that money is the only way to inspire such change. 
There are ways to go about improving the NFL’s diversity without systematically rewarding teams for taking advantage of people of color, and ideas such as Parker’s are a perfect example. The league is trying to get to the right destination, but the road there — at least the one outlined Friday — is undeniably the wrong one.

Before the coronavirus outbreak, Jarod Majeika, who received a bachelor’s degree in health promotion and disease prevention studies, couldn’t have been less worried about searching for a job after graduation. 
Now, with graduation ceremonies complete, recent graduates like Majeika face potential unemployment, with many struggling to find jobs amid mass layoffs and hiring freezes. Some are striking potential offers, interviewing virtually, or, in the case of receiving no job offers, preparing to continue their education by applying to graduate school. 
Unlike recent graduating classes, the Class of 2020 will be entering a job market that may beget an economic recession, with current unemployment exceeding 14% as of April 2020, according to the U.S. Department of Labor — the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression. 
“I really feel nervous about applying for stuff … because I need money,” Majeika said. “It’s pretty anxiety-inducing that before March, I was kind of like, ‘Oh, I don’t need to look at jobs too much’ but now I’m like, ‘It’s not like I can even find a job now.’” 
As USC moved to remote instruction, Ashley Estés, who received a bachelor’s degree in popular music performance, said she has missed various career development opportunities as her major program canceled shows and a final project that would have allowed her to meet potential employers in the music industry. 
“As a performance major, we’re not specifically going out on the job search like typical students,” Estés said. “For us, it’s really centered around doing shows, networking at events, having people come and see us and then really utilizing online, social media to boost our followings and grow our audiences. So I say [job hunting has] been tarnished in a way by the pandemic.”
But with the pandemic affecting her plans to advance her career through a series of summer shows and a release of two singles, Estés is currently in limbo, waiting on a chance to revive her musical projects. 
“The minute we’re allowed to go outside, I’ll be hopefully back in production … just really pushing my career forward as much as I can,” Estés said. “I love performing, so that’s the ultimate goal.”
While performance majors struggle to further their careers in a virtual environment,  graduates in STEM majors have also been facing difficulties in their job search.
Although Evelyn Cliff, who received a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering, is currently applying to several engineering jobs in the public service sector, she is concerned by the prospect that some state government employers may lay off their workers as budgets are cut during the pandemic.
“I don’t know that a hiring freeze is necessarily in the future, but it’s definitely possible that state employees could be furloughed as well as county employees,” Cliff said. “As someone who’s looking to work in public service, if the state isn’t hiring, I don’t really have a lot of places to go.”
Camila Thur de Koos, who received a bachelor’s degree in political science, has been reaching out to companies recommended by her internship manager but has found no success in her job search since many employers have issued hiring freezes. Along with limited job opportunities, Thur de Koos said navigating the job market has become even more challenging with the increase in job seekers due to recent layoffs. 
“It’s not only that these companies are no longer expanding, but now they have to look at how they’re going to cut costs,” Thur de Koos said. “It’s kind of frustrating that you’re seeing a bunch of people getting laid off because now you’re competing with even more people who weren’t going to be in the job market initially.”
Although students may face economic issues, including hiring freezes, during the pandemic, Senior Director of Alumni and Student Career Services at the USC Career Center Lori Shreve Blake said graduating students should persist in the job search because employers may issue exceptions to freezes if a role is considered essential. 
“There are organizations that even though they have a hiring freeze, they still have critical roles that need to be filled if they’re vacant, and they’re applying for exemptions to fill those roles,” Blake said. “Even when you hear, ‘Oh, so and so is taking a hiring freeze’ … you might be able to get one of those opportunities.”
As an extra precaution, Cliff and her friends are studying to retake their graduate school entry exams in case they are unable to find a job. With the likelihood of low-interest rates on loans during an economic recession, Cliff believes returning to school may be the best option if she cannot get a job offer.
“In the face of a crash in the job market or in the face of a recession or anything like that, one of the things a lot of people tend to do is going back to school,” Cliff said. “There’s no jobs, so you might as well be learning.”
Although pursuing job opportunities during the pandemic seems futile, Blake, who has experienced two economic downturns during her 20 years working at USC, including the 2001 dot-com bubble and 2008 Great Recession, said students should apply to jobs that are currently in high demand. 
“What I encourage our students to do is follow the money … which businesses are doing well,” Blake said. “What I would say to students is take down the blinders — you can look at the Googles and Apples … of the world, but I would also look at those companies that one has never heard of before because that may be where your next opportunity is.”
Majeika said he feels pressured to change the scope of his job applications to improve his chances of getting offers. He is currently focusing on frontline health care work instead of public health policy.
“A lot of public health jobs right now is just needing people to screen individuals at airports and or needing people to administer tests,” Majeika said. “I want to work in public health to prevent things like this, so I was like, ‘Oh, I’m going to go do research and inform policy that will make a more just and safe society’ … Now I have to apply to more reactive jobs instead of things that will really allow me to think to the future.”
With many college students and graduating seniors ineligible for stimulus checks due to their dependent status, Thur de Koos said students face greater financial pressure during the pandemic than others, including small businesses, which receive government assistance. 
Despite the economic aid provided by the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund of the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, many college students only qualify for funds if they’re facing dire circumstances. Due to federal guidelines, however, of the $19.3 million allocated to USC, aid will not be disbursed to students with specific circumstances that preclude them from eligibility, such as students who are undocumented or international or who fail to make satisfactory academic progress.
Although career prospects are proving dismal for graduates in art programs, some have found innovative ways to stand out in the job market. Estés, who cannot pursue career options as she typically would, said Thornton School of Music faculty and administration have continued to help students in the Class of 2020 advance their careers, such as through associate professor Chris Sampson’s podcast “Joy Sounds,” a program featuring upcoming artists, inviting graduating seniors to promote their music. 
“I’m trying to see the silver lining in the situation, which is just more time to hone in on my craft,” Estés said. “It’s sad, but I know we’re going to have our time, so I try not to be too pessimistic about the situation.”

Finals are over, the sun is out and temperatures are on the rise in southern California, and though safer-at-home orders are still in place for Los Angeles residents, this month’s listening guide will help keep the boredom at bay with fresh music and podcasts. This guide will help you kick off your summer break after crushing finals, get started on some late spring cleaning or finish that at-home workout. Whether you want to discover new artists or see what’s to come this month from your die-hard favorites, May has brought plenty of new melodies and podcasts to fill your homes. 
New music out this month
Here are some of the latest songs and albums from artists from a variety of genres. 
“Dark Lane Demo Tapes” by Drake
If you’re a fan of Canadian rapper Drake, you’re in luck because he recently dropped an impressive 14-track mixtape called “Dark Lane Demo Tapes” on the first of the month. The mixtape is considered a lead-in to his sixth studio album, which the artist himself announced will come out later this summer. The project features several of Drake’s “demos,” hence the title of the record. It’s a compilation of some of Drake’s songs that have been leaked on the internet and ones he’s previously released on SoundCloud, as well as some new sounds fans have never heard. The demo reel showcases Drake’s melancholic R&B/hip-hop flow, precise delivery, musical hooks and beats. Take a listen if you want more insight into how Drake’s sound has developed and what to expect on his next album. 
“The End of Everything” by Noah Cyrus
Soft vocals, acoustic sounds, gentle piano and slow-burning melodies occupy the eight tracks on multi-platinum artist Noah Cyrus’ new EP, which was released May 15. Cyrus shares a lot of raw emotions in her lyrics about growing up, including experiencing loneliness and heartbreak at a young age. One of the more memorable songs that play to these themes is “Young & Sad,” which begins with a voicemail from Noah’s father, Billy Ray Cyrus, reminding her that she’s never lost in the world and to keep smiling because everything’s going to be okay. Cyrus has admitted in the past to struggling with depression and anxiety and has never been shy about speaking out on mental health issues. In 2019, she teamed up with the Seize the Awkward Campaign to share her story. The campaign encourages young people to open up to their friends about mental health challenges and create a safe space to discuss their concerns. This album reveals an intimate and more serene side to who Noah Cyrus is and what she has experienced as an individual. 
“Stuck with U” by Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber
Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber collaborated on a pop quarantine-themed song called “Stuck with U,” which dropped May 7. All of the sales from listening, watching and sharing the ballad benefit the First Responders Children Foundation, which helps fund grants to support the children of first responders and families during the pandemic. The song boasts Grande’s four-octave soprano vocal range and Bieber’s falsetto register. Tonally, the song has a slow and sweet yet dynamic harmonious sound. The release of the duet also came with a music video which features a series of self-recorded clips from the two pop stars as well as clips featuring fans dancing in their homes to the song.
“Notes on a Conditional Form” by The 1975
English band The 1975 is releasing its fourth studio album on May 22. “Notes On A Conditional Form” is bound to be the perfect indie soundtrack to your summer. If you’re unfamiliar with The 1975’s unique blend of genres and influences, the group has a funk rock, indie pop sound. Many of its songs will make you want to dance around in your living room or jump in your car and take a drive. The band released a single called “Guys” off the album on May 13, which will make you long for the days with your friends pre-quarantine. Along with the other early releases from the album, the singles reveal how heartwarming, confessional and incredibly thought-provoking the 22-track album will be. Based on the single, the familiar indie sound that The 1975 has produced over the years is likely to continue in its new album. 
“Chromatica” by Lady Gaga
Making a return to her dance-pop roots after her deeply personal and intimate work on “A Star is Born” and her 2016 album “Joanne,” pop music icon Lady Gaga is less than two weeks away from dropping her long-awaited sixth studio album on May 29. But before getting too excited to binge-listen to every song on Chromatica, the star recently announced that the second single off the album will come out this Friday. The upcoming single “Rain on Me” is a collaboration with fellow pop singer Ariana Grande. Neither artist has released any teasers of the song, but there’s no doubt that these two Italian, New York-raised singers have made a hit. Gaga has also announced song collaborations on the album with Blackpink and Elton John. Based on the visuals in the music video for “Stupid Love” and Gaga’s recent Instagram posts, there’s no doubt that with the birth of this new album, she is once again reinventing herself.

Podcasts to cure your quarantine woes
Have you started to experience cabin fever yet? Take a listen to these podcasts while you’re going about your daily routine to curb the quarantine monotony you may be feeling.  
“Unlocking Us”
This podcast explores the ideas, stories, experiences, books, films and music that mirror the universal human experience. Brené Brown, the podcast’s host, is a researcher and No. 1 New York Times bestselling author who also hosted a notable TED talk about the power of vulnerability in 2010. In the most recent episode of “Unlocking Us,” Brown sits down with writers Jay and Mark Duplass to talk about their memoir, “Like Brothers.” Their discussions revolve around paradoxes in love, creativity and relationships.
“Modern Love”
If you’re a fan of the popular New York Times column “Modern Love,” then you may already be familiar with this podcast. But if not, “Modern Love” features readings of the column by the essayists themselves. Most episodes are around 20 minutes long. They are easy and amusing to listen to, as they are told and written by real people. The archive of love stories are fascinating and inspiring because their essays are about not only budding romances and first dates but the committed love involved in caretaking, confinement, loss and redemption. On May 12, an episode called “Alone in a Pandemic” was released. In the episode, we hear from people who are living in solitude during the pandemic and learn how they’re coping. There’s nothing more fitting and comforting at this time than to hear stories about how others are finding joy and love during challenging times. 
“Crime Junkie”
The name of the podcast says it all. If you’re into true-crime stories then this podcast is well-suited for you. Hosted by Ashley Flowers and Brit Prawat, each episode covers a new true-crime story. It’s not difficult to become thoroughly engaged in the way these events are told by the hosts. The tantalizing twists and turns of different stories narrated as dark mysteries which are slowly uncovered make this podcast one that will keep you listening.   
“Chasing Cosby”
Famous American stand-up comedian Bill Cosby led a dark, secret life behind his comedic façade, which the episodes of this podcast uncover. From the Los Angeles Times and hosted by investigative journalist Nicki Weisensee Egan, the podcast garnered firsthand accounts from many of the women involved in the sexual assault charges against Cosby. Each woman has the opportunity to speak her truths about the man who once brought warmth and laughter into Americans’ homes. These are the stories of the women who brought him to justice.

The week before spring break was a tumultuous one for all of us. 
As a student who receives Disability Services and Programs accommodations, I submitted a request to alter my accommodations due to the transition to remote learning. Taking classes and tests online was significantly more difficult for me than taking them in person. Not only did my professors not have a good format for testing — specifically in my organic chemistry and calculus classes, which switched from the department website to Blackboard and then to Google Forms — but the constant back and forth from my computer to paper proved challenging for me. Evidenced by the fact that I was doing well in my classes before the online transition, it wasn’t the material or class content I was struggling with but the messy online format in the stressful circumstances the outbreak had fostered. 
One week later, I was informed my request was denied. 
“The University recognizes [the challenging transition online] and has provided students with additional options to withdraw from classes or change grading options and make the best academic decision for you,” read the email I received in early April.
When I told my doctor in our appointment mid-March that people were arguing about universal pass/no pass, she just said, “People are dying. Why are they so pressed about a letter grade?” I couldn’t have agreed more. 
As the pandemic progresses, it is clear that the University is implementing decisions in an effort to help students and staff adjust to our new world. The provost’s office is taking careful steps to ensure that this transition remains as “SCandal”-free as possible by allowing students to stay in housing, paying student workers through the end of the semester, providing some resources to those who need it through emergency assistance funds and more. Despite these measures, USC is failing in an area that continues to be its Achilles’ heel: Concern for students’ mental health. What is even worse is that the University insists it’s doing the best it can. 
The current grading options, which include pass/no pass, no record and letter, are just that: options. They are options that students who are in worse circumstances due to the coronavirus may be forced to take, although many interested in further education will not be able to. While I inquired for more information from the University about how it will specifically accommodate DSP students, I just continued to receive PR speech that neither fulfilled my request nor addressed my primary concerns. 
I tweeted about my frustration and accepted USC’s request to pass my tweet along to higher-ups. A week later, I received a response from the director of DSP, who directed me to the Resolving Concerns tab on DSP’s website. Not only did her email fail to provide any new information, but she didn’t address any of my concerns with the online testing format. After this response, I gave up on the bureaucratic pipeline and the hope that USC would do right by its students. 
However, deep down I always knew this would happen because the provost’s office regards me as yet another Black face. Every day I am reminded that the United States was not built for Black people. This is not new information, but I am constantly reminded of this fact when I see the rising statistics about the disproportionate number of Black people dying from the coronavirus. The percentage of Black people dying outweighs their share of the population in almost every state where data is available, such as Michigan, where Black people make up 40% of the death toll but only 14% of the population.
The days that are really bad it’s as if my life is on mute: Everything is bleak. Every day, I worry about my grandmother and my little cousin who have significant risk factors that make them vulnerable to the virus. I worry about my friends when their families get sick. After weeks of staying home, I have to reconcile with the fact that there is nothing to look forward to for the next several months. And as most of us have realized, as long as people continue to act selfishly, such as by protesting safer-at-home orders, there is no hard end date in sight. 
These are difficult times for everyone. As my therapist refers to it, this “fake normal” has been a hard adjustment, as we remain isolated and are stripped of any source of routine. There’s nothing that sucks the meaning out of life more than when everything in the world is dark and scary. 
In the darkness however, I found a light: Netflix competition reality shows. My journey began with “Instant Hotels,” an Australian Airbnb competition, then a glassblowing competition with “Blown Away,” and finally, “Interior Design Masters.” For some reason, I just can’t use this time to watch heavy dramas. It’s a stupid thing, but I just want to be entertained with the television I watch. 
After sitting with my frustration for a week, I figured out what I need to do daily to remain well in times of social distancing: Talk with a loved one on the phone, shower and do my full skin-care routine and cook a meal. It’s relatively simple, but establishing a routine has worked for me. I hope everyone has been able to find something that gives them peace at this time. Otherwise, it is too much anxiety for anyone to bear. 
I miss my family. I miss hanging out with my friends. I miss walking around campus. I miss my life. But I have to believe everything will be OK.

Male privilege: Last semester, I accidentally bought 40 virtual bus tickets. To use them all before they expired, I would take evening strolls downtown in solitude, fearless of being catcalled or harassed. I would gaze at the colossal skyscrapers, my nostalgia evoked by the industrial scent and techno light beams emitted around the Staples Center. 
Class and white privilege: I come from a suburb in Albuquerque, N.M. referred to as the “Northeast Heights,” otherwise dubbed the “Northeast Whites.” My high school had a reputation for having well-off students and a cocaine problem. I never have to worry about paying for meals or next month’s rent. I attend one of the best universities in the world because I worked hard and had access to resources that made my path to success feasible. 
Privilege. It is one of the most hot-button topics of discussion today, especially in a country experiencing escalating racial tensions. These tensions came to the media forefront once again when Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, was gunned down nearly three months ago while jogging in a suburb in Glynn County, Ga. The suspects were not arrested until early May, following national uproar over the lack of action taken by the Glynn County Police Department. Meanwhile, state-issued lockdowns to slow the spread of the coronavirus are prompting armed protests in states such as Michigan, where demonstrators are comparing Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to Adolf Hitler.
These juxtaposing protests drive a double-edged sword through the heart of America — one side is demanding justice for the unlawful racial profiling and murder of a Black man while the other is employing white supremacy to protest stay-at-home orders. This paradox reflects systemic privilege; one response tackles it while the other abuses and perpetuates it. 
Police-involved shootings have reflected this persisting clash for the past decade, birthing the #BlackLivesMatter movement as well as its #BlueLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter counterparts. From “Dateline NBC” to the release of the “The Hate U Give” book and film, racial profiling and violence within the police force have garnered massive scrutiny from the media. Notably, back in 2012, neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black teen. Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter the following year. 
I remember being outraged by the murder, even more so by the acquittal. This outrage was rehashed in February, when Zimmerman filed a defamation lawsuit against former presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg for their unjust framing of Zimmerman as a white supremacist and perpertrator of gun violence in their remembrance tweets on Martin’s 25th birthday. Zimmerman also sued Martin’s family for defamation.
My outrage at these situations prompted me to rethink my perception of privilege. It brought me back to a “Saturday Night Live” sketch following the 2016 presidential election in which a group of white, liberal, anti-Trump friends watch the election’s live results with Chris Martin and Dave Chappelle. As the night progresses, the white friends become visibly upset and angry as it becomes more apparent that Hillary Clinton is going to lose. Meanwhile, Martin and Chapelle remain cynical and ostensibly less irate. 
This “SNL” sketch comments on race relations, but it also highlights the way we react to injustice reflects privilege, too. The white people in the “SNL” sketch have the privilege of being more idealistic because their experience is different from the Black experience. My experience growing up white sculpted the way I perceive society and engage with social issues.
My outrage stemmed from passion for justice, but it also came from a place of high expectations, where my privilege paved a gap between my optimism and reality. This privilege can be acknowledged and used to craft allyship. The national outcry for Ahmaud Arbery, in addition to other victims of racist murders, demonstrates a constructive use of privilege. Those in more advantaged positions can use their voices for those unable to.
The white privilege on display in Michigan, on the other hand, conveys a failure to acknowledge privilege in its nuanced forms. Being able to quarantine under a roof is class privilege. Being able to protest in a public space with assault rifles without being arrested or killed is white privilege. Being healthy while other people are dying is a privilege in and of itself. Ultimately, privilege is toxic when it perpetuates injustice instead of helping to combat it. 
My experiences follow a different narrative than others’, and so do yours. I can write this piece in remembrance of Ahmaud Arbery and Trayvon Martin because I am fortunate enough to be in good health and still be able to write. My privilege and your privilege can both be assets. We must use them to advocate for those who cannot do so alone.

The relationship between cannabis and my family has been tumultuous, intriguing and, quite frankly, confusing to say the least. 
My parents’ views on cannabis went from unfathomable disgust (my mother couldn’t say the word “weed” — it was hilarious) to reluctant acceptance when they realized my older brother wouldn’t drop his pot-smoking habits. Recently, we have entered the territory of what seems like genuine appreciation, with my father asking me to bake him oatmeal cookie edibles (a terrible combination, to be brutally honest). This is not to mention the cannabis plants my dad’s currently growing and the business he told me he wants to launch.
I went from a Nancy Reagan-esque household to one where vape cartridge boxes and empty bud containers are strewn across my kitchen table daily. And while I’m pleased with my family’s gradual shift in opinion, I tread lightly since it still feels like some intricately planned trap to expose me as a no-good, delinquent weed aficionado. So, yeah, what gives?
My parents — who have just entered their 50s — and their strange, yet welcomed, shifting attitudes toward cannabis are reflective of the changing times. Cannabis use among U.S. adults has doubled within a decade, according to a 2015 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Consumption of edibles and smoking has also risen two-fold among seniors over the age of 65. 
The upward trend of older consumers in the cannabis market is the result of many factors. The reality is that cannabis is, for some seniors, transformative and even life-saving. 
Legalization, especially medical legalization, allows elderly and middle-aged consumers access to an herbal substance free of the potential health risks of pharmaceuticals. Cannabis has been shown to be potentially useful in treating various ailments that are more prevalent with older age, including arthritis, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, chronic pain and sleep difficulties. For many seniors, prescription drugs also pose increasing financial burdens, often forcing people to forgo or ration medication due to greedy big pharma companies. For others, cannabis is simply a way to manage pain.
For my grandparents, it was the lattermost. My grandmother used CBD and THC to manage her chronic pain and depression as a result of her pancreatic cancer. My grandfather currently uses edibles to cope with his arthritis and Alzheimer’s. 
If some seniors turn to cannabis for its medicinal properties, then others just turn to it for recreation. And let’s face it: Weed is fun. For some elderly people, cannabis is a nostalgic memento, reminiscent of their participation in weed activism in the mid-1960s and ’70s. For others, who missed out on cannabis counterculture, it’s a chance to try something new and reconnect with a part of history they lived through. 
One place that has tapped into this growing consumer base is Bud and Bloom, a dispensary in Santa Ana that has been shuttling seniors to and from its store monthly for nearly three years. The dispensary’s shuttle program includes educational presentations on various cannabis-related topics, professional talks and free lunch. Budtenders and staff then work with seniors to give personalized product recommendations. 
At the same time, research on cannabis’ health effects is lacking — especially considering the additional risk factors many elderly and middle-aged populations face. Research on weed’s interaction with various medications for ailments common to older populations is essentially nonexistent. Preliminary studies on the blood thinner warfarin, for example, demonstrate how cannabis may harmfully interact with the medication by increasing the risk for internal bleeding.
But as elderly populations trend toward becoming vital consumers within the market, it’s important that legislation and dispensaries catch up. Research must be conducted in tandem with the changing era — preferably before people with preexisting medical conditions dive into self-medication and medical marijuana as a cure-all for their diseases without the proper information.
Ultimately, in what seems like a poorly written “Saturday Night Live” skit or old-timey stoner film, older populations are seeking out cannabis in ways comparable to younger generations. There’s nothing quite as refreshing, funny and heartwarming to me than the elderly giving weed a go. (It’s like, “Yes, of course, join the club! We have drugs and anti-capitalist sentiments here.”)

Perhaps the timing of Netflix’s newest unapologetically self-indulgent series is what makes it irresistible. “White Lines,” the Spanish-English co-production from the mind of “Money Heist” creator Álex Pina, released its first 10-episode season Friday and its overwrought, at times inappropriately funny and imaginative pageantry has not left my mind since.
Picture this: You’re sunbathing on a beach in Ibiza. A romance novel lies open on your stomach as you tip your sunglasses down to lock eyes with the gorgeous waiter that just delivered your cocktail.
Maybe it’s not your particular brand of entertainment, but “White Lines” is self-aware enough to know that you can’t even have this entertainment right now under the current quarantine circumstances. But that won’t stop it from trying to convince you.
Maybe you’re Zoe (Laura Haddock), the show’s darling who, after seeing the mummified body of her murdered brother Axel Collins (Tom Rhys Harries) after 20 years of dealing with his disappearance, takes a trip to Ibiza to find the truth of his demise, letting all the trappings of the luxurious Spanish island distract her from her dull Manchester life. And yes, there is something wrong with being dull, and the show falls into this habit from time to time.
As Zoe begins her journey to Ibiza against the background of a mix of house music, flamenco and jazz music (you can’t do anything productive here if music is not playing), we’re privy to flashbacks of Axel and the English-typified “youth in revolt” character he not only exemplified for her, but also for his former friend group of washed-up pleasure-seekers that Zoe seeks to reconnect with. He and his friends brightened their gray days and nights in Manchester by DJing, hosting parties and letting the music envelope them along with a mix of pills and other potions when Zoe and Axel’s cop father took night shifts.
We get to know Axel Collins in flashback, and yes, only the utterance of his full name can capture his illustrious nature, as a teen trying to live life, man. After being arrested for a warehouse party that ended with police in riot gear, a cheery Axel asks the withered white-wigged judge, “Have you ever had a good time?”
Well have I? The gorgeous shots of Ibizan coastline, rolling hills and Spanish villas are edited to bring out the brightest colors of the sea, golden sand and green-purple strobe lights of the club — but these are only the background of the “lives of luxury” that Axel’s now-middle-aged friends are clinging on to. David (Laurence Fox) leads a spiritual retreat for people that need to wind down after a long night of partying, Marcus (Daniel Mays) DJs by night and collects Romanian cocaine by day in a banana boat, and Anna (Angela Griffin) — oh, Anna — leads people to their awakening by hosting orgies, all because “life is best lived through the senses.”
These one-liners are perfectly profound if you’ve ingested the right mix of illicit substances.
It’s too easy and too complacent to say that the life these Brit transplants live are just sad. On one hand, they are clinging to an adolescent euphoria that is long gone, as revealed through old clips of them driving down the road to the next party where they gaze and smile at the camera with barely suppressed joy. On the other hand, they are merely puppets in a larger economic scheme, because the show would not be a Pina product without some conversation on class. 
Yet another layer to peel back is the influence of the famed Calafat family, led by the musing and overly noble Andreu (Pedro Casablanc) who decides to dig his heels in on finding Axel’s killer once the former DJ is found buried on his land in Almeria. But his ever-amusing wife Conchita (Belén López) and brusque son Oriol (Juan Diego Botto) have more important things on their mind, including securing the construction of their mega-casino to transform the island into a land of slightly more complicated vice
The connections between Axel Collins and the family start to unfold in, of course, the sexiest way, whether it be through extramarital affairs, visits to Anna’s famed sex parties or sexual awakenings until suddenly, everyone is a suspect. 
Zoe faces possibly the second biggest challenge of her life in trying to discern who is at fault and to remember what she came to Ibiza for — along with having to remind the show to get back on track as well. While taking you along for the ride, “White Lines” manages to be gorgeously distracting, achingly enviable and dishearteningly hollow at its core. Right now, that is just what I needed to latch on to.

They say the way to someone’s heart is through their stomach. And after nearly 100 years in the business, El Cholo couldn’t agree more. 
El Cholo is Los Angeles’ very first Mexican restaurant, founded in 1923 by Alejandro and Rosa Borquez. It has outlasted the Great Depression, World War II and the Rodney King riots. The restaurant has become more and more successful through each phase in history — so much so that it was able to expand to six different locations throughout Southern California. 
But as safer-at-home orders were slowly put in place, the once lively restaurant chain turned silent as El Cholo shut its doors for the longest time in its history. In order to ensure the safety of their employees and customers, the restaurants did not serve food for about a month. During that period, Brendon Salisbury, the chief financial officer of El Cholo, enacted protective measures as sales began to fall at the restaurant.
“I didn’t have a salary,” Salisbury said. “We kept only one person on our head of human resources just to have a contact for employees to reach out to and stuff like that. It was basically me and her turning off gas at a certain restaurant, locking it up, making sure that they were all safe.”
To help alleviate the financial struggle, El Cholo applied to the Paycheck Protection Program, a loan disbursed by the U.S. Small Business Administration that allows employers to keep their staff on payroll. 
“We wanted to get into that program and help us, support us and bring our staff back on so we could start paying staff again,” Salisbury said. 
Luckily, the restaurant was approved for the loan. The next steps for El Cholo involved adapting to the new normal, which meant adding online ordering for the first time and arranging deliveries through GrubHub. The restaurant has been able to sell food, albeit at a significantly lower rate than its usual dining-in experience. 
“It’s probably like 25% of what we would usually do sales-wise,” Salisbury said. “It’s just so limited. We’re a full-service restaurant — you come in, you can get a margarita, you can sit down, you know, order dessert and stuff like that.”
Moving forward, the restaurant is creating contingency plans to reimagine business under post-pandemic guidelines. The restaurant is figuring out different ways to set up the facility, taking into consideration the distance between tables and what the space might look like on the busiest nights. 
“So, obviously, there’s no idea of what it’ll actually look like when we get there, or even when we get there, but it doesn’t hurt to kind of have that planned out,” Salisbury said. 
The restaurant is also going to continue to maintain its delivery and takeout business, which Salisbury estimates will make up an important part of sales for the next 12 to 18 months. 
For now, Salisbury is using the tradition El Cholo grounded in to continue to motivate him. El Cholo is family-run, and Salisbury — who is the fourth generation of Salisburys to take over the restaurant — is not leaving any members of the El Cholo family behind. 
“I think there’s 530 people that we employ,” Salisbury said. “They get their health insurance from us. They put food on their table. Some people have worked for us for 40, 50 years.” 
For Salisbury, it’s not about making money. It’s about the history of the restaurant and the families who rely on the business. 
“It definitely means a lot more than just trying to [make] money or whatever,” Salisbury said. “It’s keeping a business alive. I mean, my great grandparents and grandparents survived the Great Depression, so I think I could survive COVID-19.”
Similarly, at Chicharroland, it is all about family. Chicharroland is run by the Fonseca family, who have been taking care of the restaurant for 11 years. Chicharroland sells chicharrones, a Mexican dish that is generally made out of fried pork. After the restaurant industry was hit hard by the pandemic, Roberto Fonseca, co-owner of Chicharroland, was shocked to find his business still running. 
“I thought it was going to be a lot slower,” Fonseca said.” “I’m just thinking of people not being able to work, not having that income that they’re used to. Of course, I felt like that was going to eventually affect us economically. So the fact that it really hasn’t — that’s what surprised me.”
Chicharroland has also taken up delivery and pickup orders to comply with state and local guidelines. These orders have been easier for Fonseca to make because he has a bit of a heads-up from customers. It makes the process less stressful than dining in, but it is still no replacement for the in-person connections Fonseca makes with his customers. 
“The same people keep coming through, so it becomes like a family thing where you do miss the people,” Fonseca said. “Even though they still come to pick up the food, there’s not really much talk between us going on, and it’s just kind of getting your food and then [leaving].”
Fonseca has not received any additional help from the government, even though he applied to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan which, according to the SBA, is meant to provide economic relief to businesses experiencing a temporary loss of revenue. 
The pandemic, however, has not crushed Fonseca’s spirits; in fact, it’s allowed him to learn more about himself and his business. 
“I feel like you want to do more than you should, which is always the goal, right?” Fonseca said. “To do something better. But as a small business, you don’t really have the financial support where you could just invest $20,000 into a new look, for example. So it just kind of humbled me down. You don’t need to have all of that as long as your food is good and the people like it.”
Fonseca is grateful for the loyalty of his customers, crediting their support and friendship as one of the reasons why Chicarroland has been able to thrive. Since the pandemic started, Chicharroland has been receiving more positive reviews on Yelp. To investigate further, Fonseca asked one of his customers one day what makes him come to his restaurant. 
“He was like, ‘I could tell that you guys care about the business — not just because of the money, but like you’re sharing a tradition with us,’” Fonseca said. “I feel like our foundation, our overall take on this business — I think is what makes those stand out versus just [making] money out of people.”
About a 10-minute drive down Vermont Avenue is a place that also has close ties with its customers. With Love Market and Cafe is known for three essential things: its grocery store, cafe and community programs. Even during the pandemic, With Love remains committed to community service.
To do so, With Love created a share box program through which customers can buy a box full of grocery supplies, such as rices, flours, beans and sugars, and it also partners with different organizations to deliver the boxes to families in need. Additionally, With Love is hiring drivers to employ more workers for the business. 
Although With Love has a market and a cafe, the cafe side of their operation was the most popular part of the business. College students would gather in the cafe to study for midterms and finals. The spring season was also With Love’s busiest time due to graduation parties and extra catering orders. This year, With Love founder Andrew McDowell had to quickly determine how he was going to adjust to his business.
“We had to figure out pretty much overnight what we could do to be able to serve our community and be able to keep our employees,” McDowell said. “Pretty quickly, we realized that our grocery — which is an area we haven’t focused on very much and wasn’t as popular as some of the other things — became super popular immediately.”
Although there was an extra demand for grocery items, McDowell experienced a shortage of staff. 
“Figuring out staff is difficult because in the middle of a pandemic, you have staff [whose] lives are changing too,” McDowell said. “It’s not just your business. Can they still come to work? Are they living with high-risk people? Do they have a cough?”
About half of With Love’s staff couldn’t work within a couple of days of the safer-at-home order. To remedy the shortage, McDowell picked up extra hours at the store. 
After experiencing loss in clientele due to Trader Joe’s opening in USC Village in 2017, With Love’s market is suddenly reaching new peaks in sales. The cafe side of the business, however, is operating at 10% to 15% of its normal capacity. To keep business going, McDowell started a program to send lunch boxes to hospital workers. 
The future remains unpredictable for McDowell and his business, but he hopes to one day grow With Love by adding a pizzeria to the store. For now, he is working almost every day to keep his business running and remains optimistic that he will emerge stronger from these struggles.

Jeremy Kipp, a former head coach at Boise State and Northwestern and previously an assistant at USC, is taking over as the newest head coach of the USC men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams, athletic director Mike Bohn announced Tuesday. 
Kipp served as the head coach at Northwestern the past two seasons, leading the Wildcats’ men’s team to the No. 22 national ranking in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season as well as their highest finish — fifth place — in the Big Ten since 2007. He helped the team score 665 points this year, the most in the school’s history, while producing seven All-Americans. Kipp led the women’s team to the No. 25 national ranking, fourth place in the Big Ten — the team’s best since 2002 — and 907.5 points, also a program record.
Kipp was the women’s head coach at Boise State from 2016 to 2018, winning the Mountain West Conference Women’s Coach of the Year award each year and taking home the conference championship in 2017 and 2018. 
“We are delighted to welcome Jeremy Kipp back to the Trojan Family,” Bohn said in a press release. “He was highly regarded during his time at USC as an assistant, then he quickly built a strong program at Boise State and made a remarkable and immediate impact at Northwestern. Recognized throughout the swimming profession as a rising star, he possesses a unique talent to lead, empower and relate to today’s student-athlete, which is consistent with our student-athlete centric leadership model.”
Kipp served as an assistant at USC from 2008 to 2015, including the last five years working as the head assistant. Kipp helped lead USC’s recruiting program and worked primarily with the team’s sprinters.
The men’s and women’s team earned a top-eight NCAA finish in each of Kipp’s last five years, churning out 107 All-Americans and 38 individual champions during his eight years as an assistant. USC also brought in top-five recruiting classes for seven consecutive years.
“There is no tradition like that of the USC swimming and diving program, one that is near and dear to my heart,” Kipp said in the same press release. “I am honored and committed to leading USC to the highest level in and out of the pool. To our current Trojan swimmers and divers, I look forward to our journey together in consistently becoming one of the nation’s top programs.”
Kipp also spent eight seasons with the UC Santa Barbara men’s and women’s teams, coached the Austria national team at the 2009 European Championships and has mentored 25 Olympic qualifiers who have won a combined 17 medals.
Kipp’s hire comes four months after Dave Salo announced the 2020 season would be his final of 14 as USC’s head coach. The USC women’s team ranked No. 8 nationally in the shortened 2020 season while the men finished No. 21. 
USC’s men’s swim and dive program has won nine NCAA championships and the women have won one.
“Jeremy is the right person to elevate our historically successful men’s and women’s swimming programs,” Bohn said. “We are thrilled that he is our new head coach.”
