An oil field in South Los Angeles, where Allenco Energy Co. increased oil production in 2010, might be responsible for the dizziness, headaches and nosebleeds residents have been experiencing, according to a recent Los Angeles Times article.

The oil field, located adjacent to Mount St. Mary’s College, recently increased production by more than 400 percent.
Allenco Energy produced 4,178 barrels of oil on the land, which is rented from the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, in 2009 and 21,239 barrels of oil there in 2010, according to the state’s Division of Oil, Gas & Geothermal Resources.
Residents of the community noticed a strange odor and complained 251 times to air quality officials since the oil field increased production, compared to the eight University Park complaints in 2008 to 2009, the Times reported. Allenco has been cited 15 times by the South Coast Air Quality Management District for foul odors. The district, however, said the air samples it tested showed that the odors are harmless.
Najmedin Meshkati, a professor in the Astani Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at USC, is an expert in the process of safety management at petrochemical plants. When asked about the safety of having an oil field adjacent to schools and homes, he said that it really depends on what the company is doing at each site. If it is at the production level and it is well-sealed and well-maintained, then there should not be a problem.
“We cannot have a generic rule,” Meshkati said.
Many students at USC also said that air pollution is a problem in Los Angeles.
Emily Jetter, a sophomore majoring in psychology, said she is frequently out of breath  in Los Angeles, because there is so much pollution in the air when she is walking.
“When I go home I just take a breath of fresh air and I feel like the air is actually going into my lungs,” said Jetter, who is originally from Connecticut.
The oil wells are located on West 23rd Street, just over a mile from USC’s campus. Many students who enjoy exercising outdoors around campus said the air quality in Los Angeles is concerning.
“I usually go running in the morning and night and I wish there were more trees so the air would be cleaner,” said Madai Sanchez, a senior majoring in civil engineering.
Emily Bayasud, a first-year graduate student at the School of Social Work, recently came to Los Angeles from New York. She heard about the allegations against Allenco and said the problem should be fixed before it leads to worse consequences.
“It should be nipped in the bud. It’s a problem, and it should always be addressed,” Bayasud said.
Maite Francois, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience, blamed the city’s overcrowded conditions for the unfortunate placement of an oil field so close to residential and academic buildings. She said that she did not believe Los Angeles allocated enough space for the oil field, in order for it to not be a problem for residents.
“Like every big city, there are going to be impurities in the air, but this situation is not acceptable,” Francois said.
Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) sent a letter to the U.S. Environmental Protect Agency on Sept. 26, asking the group to investigate and address the issue.

For USC Libraries Special Collections archivist Michaela Ullmann, every day is an adventure into the lives of World War II era German exiles.
Bookworm · USC Libraries Special Collections archivist Michaela Ullmann glances over historical poems at Doheny Memorial Library. – Deena Khattab | Daily Trojan
Ullmann, an exile studies librarian, received her master’s degree in cultural anthropology in Germany. Exile studies, however, go much deeper than basic anthropology. Ullmann’s work focuses on the group of German-speaking exiles who fled to Southern California during World War II.
In addition to collecting papers and materials, Ullmann analyzes the impact of this community of exiles on the Los Angeles cultural scene. She finds materials that show how German exiles influenced the Los Angeles art, music and literary movements of the time.
Today, her work influences Holocaust researchers and writers, as well as students at USC.
“The work that we do here affects people. Every day, people are influenced by our materials, and we have a direct connection to the scholarly work that they produce using our materials,” Ullmann said.
Beyond curating the exile studies collection, Ullmann also engages in library outreach. She invites professors and their classes to experience Special Collections for themselves, tailoring the content of the archive to fit the needs of the visiting class.
“I really love being connected with students and seeing that what we do gets somewhere. It doesn’t stay in a box. We create excitement and engagement,” Ullmann said.
The students Ullmann connects with most are those who work at Special Collections.
“I always enjoy having student workers be involved in this. It’s interesting for them but it’s also interesting for me to see how their experiences and perspectives affect their work,” Ullmann said.
Lisa Ebiner Gavit, a junior majoring in philosophy, works at Special Collections with Ullmann.
“It is really fascinating to sort through the primary sources,” Gavit said. “It is both challenging and rewarding to try to piece together the story of a family or an individual simply by looking at their photos and reading their letters and notes.”
Ullmann said her biggest obstacle is making sure all students, not just the students who work there, are aware of the research resources housed in the archives.
In order to further connect the students with the available primary materials, Ullmann began hosting what she calls “petting zoo” sessions at Special Collections. During these sessions, students can browse the materials and interact directly with primary sources. The goal of these petting zoos is to get students thinking about the documents and potential research projects they can create using the materials.
But the outreach does not end there. Ullmann and the Special Collections staff have recently launched a Primary Sources Research Award. Students can submit papers and assignments that they used primary sources to complete to win a $500 award. These papers can be previously competed for class — the only criterion is that the student used primary documents from any USC Library, including the Cinematic Arts Library or the East Asian Studies Center, to write the paper.
In order to further help students in their quest to find research materials, Ullmann is working on an online tutorial to show students how to access the archives. She hopes that if students are better acquainted with the system, they will feel more comfortable coming into the library to do research.
“Many undergraduate students don’t know that they are more than welcome to come and work with these materials,” Ullmann said. “We’re trying to get rid of their fear of the unknown.”

It might be too early to tell what significant impacts this week’s government shutdown will have on the country, but students and faculty at USC have already been affected.
David Brown, associate senior vice president of the USC Office of Federal Relations, said that though USC has experienced only minimal effects in the last few days, there are three areas that receive federal funding that could be impacted: research, education and healthcare.
Receiving future federal grants for research in departments such as energy or security could become more difficult, Brown said. Research grants that projects have received will continue to be funded, but new grant opportunities have been halted.
In addition, federal student aid for the spring semester and beyond could be altered. According to the U.S. Department of Education, most of the grants and aid have already been extended for the 2013 semester.
In Washington, the conflict largely came about because of partisan disagreement on the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as “Obamacare.” Republicans and Democrats at USC also have different takes on the shutdown.
Giuseppe Robalino, director of political affairs and strategy for the USC College Republicans, sees the university as already being adequately prepared financially due to its large endowment.
“I think [USC is] very prepared to step in for the federal government if the students are having trouble with loans,” he said.
Brown also said that reimbursements for Medicare and Medicaid patients could be affected by the shutdown. Though the university will still receive funds for medical education training, its medical center’s ability to reimburse some patients will be hindered.
If the shutdown lasts more than two to three weeks, it will have an impact on research funds and student aid, according to Brown. The change in cash flow from the federal government will inhibit competition for new research opportunities.
“It’s intensely problematic for universities like USC, especially as it applies to our research enterprise and our students, and I hope the Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate can come to an agreement to fund the government in 2013,” Brown said.
Though USC is safe from dependencies such as research grants from the federal government, President of the USC College Democrats Catherine Shieh said the university will still be impacted.
“The federal court is no longer functioning the way it used to,” Shieh said.
Individual students have also been impacted in various ways. Some who work for the federal government might not be able to go to work.
Karla Robinson, a senior majoring in print and digital journalism, agreed that the shutdown will take a toll on government jobs.
“They’re saying it could last weeks, and I just don’t think that’s realistic for people who have to work weeks without getting any pay,” Robinson said.
Robinson herself was affected by the shutdown in a different way. She had planned to go to Sequoia National Park with SC Outfitters, but her trip was cancelled after the national parks closed down.
“I made plans with friends and was going to loan someone my car and I got my work cleared so I could leave early,” she said of her former plans.
Robinson also said the closure of national parks affected one of her professors.
“My photography teacher has contracts with the national parks to take pictures,” she said. “So for his job specifically, it’s been mayhem because all the parks are closing and he has deadlines to get these pictures in for certain publications.”
In the meantime, USC and the Office of Federal Relations will monitor the issue and work with members of the California congressional delegation to resolve the issue.
“I was a little disheartened, and it finally started to sink in, how deeply divided we are,” Robalino said. “These are issues that they’ve had with Obamacare for weeks, months and years now. It’s something that could have been resolved.”
Shieh was also disappointed with the government’s lack of accountability.
“They are not doing the skeleton of the responsibilities either,” she said. “These people should essentially be publicly shamed for the way that this is happening.”
Shieh recommended that USC students speak up and call their home Congress members, saying that something must be done.
“It is from a public uproar that these leaders will be reactionary,” she said.

Chairman Emeritus of the Producers’ Guild of America East, David V. Picker, spoke to the USC School of Cinematic Arts about his experiences in the film industry on Tuesday evening at the Ray Stark Family Theatre.
Living Legend · Celebrated film producer David Picker discusses his experiences bringing the Beatles and James Bond to the film industry. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
Picker is the former president and CEO of several film production studios, including United Artists, Paramount and Columbia Pictures. Throughout his career, he has been part of making such films as Last Tango in Paris, The Beatles’ A Hard Day’s Night, The Jerk and the James Bond franchise.
During the talk, Picker shared the stories behind the biggest films he produced during his career and his experiences of working with talents such as Ingmar Bergman, The Beatles and Steve Martin.
He began by telling the audience how he identified the potential of James Bond as a movie franchise and won the rights to the Ian Fleming novels for adaptation by United Artists. He faced competition from Columbia Pictures, but said he won the deal because of his determination and willingness to put the necessary time and effort into the projects he oversaw.
Picker also encouraged students to persevere, even in the face of failure. When asked about his biggest regrets, Picker said  Greatest Story Ever Told was the biggest flop he greenlit during his time at United Artists. He said he mistakenly believed the movie would be a success and there was no way he could have predicted the trouble, but he was able to use his other successes to save the failing company.
His unwillingness to give up formed a common theme throughout the talk, even when he was advising students about their future careers.
“I’m always asked, ‘What do I have to do to get in the movie business?’” Picker said. “And, the answer is: Take advantage, when you’re done with your education, of any opportunity you can get. People who produce movies look at their crew and they instantaneously respond to those who want more responsibility.”
Students were interested in knowing how Picker managed to balance having a family with having a career.
“You’ve got to make a decision,” he said. “I didn’t have a home life. I chose to do what I did because I loved it more than my home life. I ended up sacrificing something I shouldn’t have sacrificed.”
Claudia Esquivel, a freshman majoring in business and cinematic arts, identified the sacrifice as the most important lesson she took from Picker’s talk.
“I like what he said about balance and that he regrets not having had that family life,” she said. “I’m definitely going to see whether I can maintain that balance or not.”
Austin Kolodney, a senior majoring in film and television production, was more interested in how Picker came to be responsible for the most successful films of his career.
“I was really interested in his interest in storytelling and recognizing talent,” he said. “He was always business-minded and savvy, but what really drove him to take the projects he took was because it was the kind of stories that he wanted to see on the screen. I think that’s really admirable.”

With sidelines frequently clearing, players coaching and one defensive captain attempting to look the part, Thursday’s practice was anything but ordinary for the Trojans.
Men in the mirror · USC’s defense is trying to figure out what went wrong last week when they conceded 62 points against Arizona State. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Here, interim head coach Ed Orgeron kicked off USC’s inaugural Trojan Bowl, where the players got to call the plays and the shots for the majority of a fun-filled practice that seemed to boost team morale. The word “fun” seems to be a common thing when talking about the Trojans practice style in just their second practice with Orgeron at the helm.
“I want the guys to come out and enjoy the game of football,” Orgeron said.
Throughout practice, there were guys running around, jumping up and down while dancing to music and hyping up their fellow teammates.
The Trojan Bowl is born
Orgeron stole the idea of the “Trojan Bowl” from his time at the University of Miami. This opportunity for the older, more experienced players to coach some of the younger players who don’t get as much playing time really brought a new sense of electricity and excitement to the Trojans.
“Our younger players and some that redshirted got an opportunity to play with the older guys coaching them,” Orgeron said. “Everyone had fun doing it and there was a lot of energy and excitement.”
Redshirt junior linebacker Hayes Pullard was decked out in a camo shirt and a “Crocodile Dundee” hat as he, sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams and redshirt junior safety Josh Shaw tried to inspire their defensive teammates.
Redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler, senior running back Silas Redd, and junior wide receiver Marqise Lee were just a few of the players calling plays on offense.
They were coaching primarily the third and fourth stringers along with the scout team, as the starters and second stringers got some rest seven days before they face off against Arizona in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
“It was great getting to go out and coaching the guys today and feeling what our coaches always feel on the sideline,” Pullard said. “We got to coach some great players and they are the future of this team.”
Both sides were able to put on a show, not as much as for their play on the field, but more for their sideline antics and trash talking. When one side made a big play, they made sure the other knew by running across the field and throwing hats up in the air.
A competitive feeling was in the air as the offense and defense traded big play for big play, although the defense ended up winning in the end.
“With the offense having great offensive players like Cody and Silas on their coaching staff, our game plan was just to take the offense out of their comfort zone,” Pullard said.
Examining errors 
The Trojan’s 62-41 loss last Saturday leading up to the firing of former head coach Lane Kiffin may be a thing of the past, but the current coaching staff continues to use the game as a teaching point on what the team needs to repair going into next week.
The main goal of the coaching staff during their bye week is to diagnose just what went wrong.
“First of all, I didn’t think we played very good defense,” said Orgeron. “We kept giving up big plays, we didn’t do our assignments properly, and we were very off balanced. I thought the offense played well, but there is a few things that we need to fix on both sides that we will go over this week.”
Defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast also addressed the defense’s sudden issues against the Sun Devils.
“We had some mental errors that we hadn’t previously had, but you have to give Arizona State a lot of credit,” said Pendergast. “They draped all over us in the passing game and their quarterback made a lot of good, quick throws into the boundaries.”
Pendergast also confirmed a rumor that he took out his defensive backs to dinner earlier on Wednesday.
New beginning
Though USC players had their fun today, they’ll get back to work on Friday when they’ll begin preparing for their Thursday night date with Arizona.
“We’re going to take it one game at a time, regardless of the outcome, and we’re going to enjoy our eight-game season together as a team,” Orgeron said.
Veteran leadership is something that Orgeron has also attested to bringing up the team during a tough stretch.
“The leadership has been great and they have all been walking around like they want to be here and start this journey of our eight-game season,” Orgeron said.

The No. 2-ranked USC men’s water polo team will open up Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play at home this Saturday in the Uytengsu Aquatics Center against the No. 9-ranked UC Irvine Anteaters.
Sparkplug · Redshirt sophomore two-meter Mac Carden has been described by his teammates as the “glue guy” for the Trojans this year. – Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
 
USC (12-1) got back in the win column last weekend with two wins by large margins against Princeton (22-4) and Whittier (23-2), in which 13 different Trojans players netted goals between the two games.
As they enter conference play, the Trojans are without the No. 1 ranking that they’d carried since 2011 before losing to crosstown rival UCLA in the championship match of the NorCal Tournament, which also snapped their 41-game winning streak.
According to Vavic, though, that is a streak of the past. The team is going to simply focus on the task — winning a championship. And that starts with beating the Anteaters to begin MPSF play on the right foot.
“It’s not about the streak, it’s not about winning all the games, but it’s about winning the championship,” said head coach Jovan Vavic, who is seeking his 13th national title as a coach.
The Anteaters come to town with a 10-2 overall record after just cracking the top 10 in this week’s rankings. They haven’t played since they fell to Loyola Marymount 12-9 in the ninth-place game of the NorCal Tournament two weeks ago.
UCI is led by senior driver Mitch Wise, who is the team’s top scorer with 45 goals. Anteaters head coach Marc Hunt has goalies Michael Bailey and Alex Kazmier split time between the posts. Bailey and Kazmier are averaging 11.3 and 12.4 saves per game respectively.
In total, the UCI defense is allowing 6.5 goals per game, which could take a hit after they take on the potent Trojan offense this weekend. USC is determined not to let any scoring opportunity bypass them.
“It starts with finishing our one-on-nobodies [one-on-ones with the opposing goalies] in practice and if we focus then, it will translate into us finishing them in games,”  junior driver Kostas Genidounias said.
The Trojans are currently averaging 18.5 goals per game after putting in 241 goals in just 13 games. Senior driver and Cutino award candidate Nikola Vavic leads the team with 38 goals, followed by Genidounias, who has 33.
One player that has really motivated the team as the “hustle” guy, according to Genidounias, is redshirt sophomore two-meter Mac Carden.
“Jovan [Vavic] always says that hard work is something that we need so I just approach every practice and every game giving 110 percent,” Carden said. “I’ve been trying to show that through hustle I can improve my game, which has been driving up the team as well.”
Vavic continues to stress one element that is crucial if his team wants to win its sixth consecutive national championship: defense.
Through the latter half of the season, Vavic’s team has given up just under five goals per game with a 4.62 goals against average and players are hoping to lowering that average against UCI with the added emphasis on defense.
“Our defense hasn’t been on the level we wanted it be, and we work on it every day during training,” Genidounias said.
Many players see this Saturday’s game as a must-win game so that the team can have some momentum heading into the following weekend’s SoCal Tournament in Irvine, Calif.
“We need to be really focused this weekend so that we can get the win against UCI and then next we need to be at our best next weekend and win all four games so we can return back to No. 1,” Carden said.
Though the state-of-the-art facility in the Uytengsu Aquatics Center remains under construction, there is still plenty of space for fans in the upper stands. The two MPSF foes are set to clash at 1 p.m.

When newly appointed interim USC head coach Ed Orgeron took the podium for last Sunday’s press conference, he didn’t promise a Rose Bowl berth. He didn’t guarantee USC would beat a certain conference rival. What he did say, though, was telling.
“I’m gonna have some energy, some excitement. High-fiving guys, having fun,” Orgeron said.
But Orgeron’s definition of the word “fun” is a little different from the layperson’s definition of “fun.”
When I covered spring practices last semester, I got to know (at least by proxy) Mr. Edward Orgeron Jr.
It’s a sunny, but cool spring evening at Howard Jones field. Orgeron stands like a man of authority on the field. His boulder-like belly protrudes from his waist, draped with a baggy cardinal polo that is tucked into his shorts. He issues some instructions to the defensive linemen prior to a drill. For this drill, the linemen will crouch and run underneath a three-foot trampoline. The defensive linemen line up about five yards behind the trampolines. A piercing shriek of a whistle, then — “Coach O” comes out.
His gravelly drill sergeant’s yell is at once frightening and reassuring at the same time. His usually straight back curves. Orgeron bends over and cups his hands around his mouth and imparts his wisdom.
“Keep those heads up, boys! Keep your head up! Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go! KEEP YOUR HEAD UP, KENNY! MOVE YOUR A–, KENNY!” Orgeron screams. He’s referring to freshman defensive tackle Kenny Bigelow, who sprints, ducks under the trampoline and comes out on the other side looking like he just finished a marathon.
If there was a spiritual equivalent of Ed Orgeron, it would be Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann from Stanley Kubrick’s Full Metal Jacket. Except Orgeron is more of a man. And on the USC football team, there are no Gomer Pyles.
Which is necessary, if you think about it. Football is the sport that most easily serves as a metaphor for war. And like war, the head coach, the “general,” if you will, plays an integral role.
As generals go, former USC head coach Lane Kiffin was a pure strategist — a bit of a control freak, if you will. He meticulously trafficked the disbursal of information, to the point where practices were closed and injury information was kept under wraps. Recruiting the best players was a must. To Kiffin, the details and the strategy of the meta-game ware more pressing concerns than the tactics of football, much of which he left to his (very able) coordinators.
Except that approach backfired during the heat of the game. Kiffin’s inexperience with the tactics of the actual game of football reared its ugly head earlier this season, as he was unable to master the one aspect of coaching that the world could actually see: calling plays.
By comparison, Orgeron takes a far more hands-on approach. He is on the ground floor, communicating with his players. For lack of a better comparison, he is on the frontline with his soldiers, barking orders, turning boys into men. Orgeron is the Sergeant Hartmann to Kiffin’s General Petraeus. And though Orgeron’s ability to manage a game remains to be seen, his animated brand of coaching and (ironically) more relaxed demeanor towards his players (desserts after practice? Where do I sign up to play?) is a refreshing change of pace from the austere atmosphere engineered by Kiffin’s strategic designs.
Whether the Trojans will win games is uncertain; they will still be without junior wide receiver Marqise Lee, and the monstrous defensive front seven still belies a thinned-out rear flank  — the secondary that gave up 351 passing yards and three TD’s last week against Arizona State. The Trojan faithful will undoubtedly want to think of better days, back when Matt Barkley, Robert Woods and Lee were making it rain touchdowns like dollar bills at the club. But with those touchdowns came a kind of dispassionate arrogance, the expectation that “this is what’s supposed to happen.”
The Trojans are now at a crossroads where there simply are no expectations. It’s a bye week for USC, so that means Orgeron gets a little extra time to shift the coaching mentality from blue-blooded to blue collar. The Trojans will enter the weekend preparing for eight games of war, and in all eight of those games, the outcome is uncertain.
If you’re a fan of college football, there’s only one certainty now: compared to watching Lane Kiffin calmly lose games, watching Ed Orgeron get worked up on the sideline is going to be a hell of a lot of fun.

The Battle of California begins this week for the USC women’s volleyball team, who will put their 12-1 record on the line against their Northern California rivals.
Veteran presence · Senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard’s hitting percentage (.418) for USC this season is her best career mark. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
After a successful sweep of Utah in Salt Lake City, the No. 2 Women of Troy return this week to the Galen Center, where they will host No. 7 Stanford on Friday night and California on Sunday night.
USC (12-1, 2-0) remains undefeated in conference play with a 3-0 sweep of Utah last Sunday. Sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio paved the way with 16 kills and four service aces, and senior libero Natalie Hagglund once again anchored a strong defensive effort with 18 digs.
Since falling to University of San Diego on Sept. 13, USC has rattled off six straight wins and has yet to be pushed to a fifth set by any opponent. But the squad is aware that a long, tiring match could very well be looming against the Cardinal.
“Stanford is really playing well. As you can see, last night they beat up on UCLA,” head coach Mick Haley said. “Offensively, they’re scoring at a very high clip, so we’ve been trying to get comfortable with some of the things they do and see if we can design some things that will cause them some difficulty.”
The Cardinal (10-2, 3-0) will arrive at USC on the heels of an impressive sweep over No. 16 UCLA, turning back the Bruins 25-17, 25-15, 25-16 to stay unbeaten in conference play. Stanford has won eight straight games to improve to 10-3 and features three returning All-Americans in senior middle blocker Carly Wopat, sophomore middle blocker Inky Ajanaku and senior outside hitter Rachel Williams.
On the other side, the Women of Troy have the offensive firepower and youth to match the Cardinal. Freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu earned Pac-12 Freshman of the Week honors for the second time this season after posting 17 kills to beat UCLA and nine to defeat Utah. Sophomore Samantha Bricio, who earned the honor herself five times last season, is second on the team with 3.2 kills per set and leads the entire conference with 32 service aces.
It was USC’s upperclassmen, however, who knocked off Stanford last November, and Haley will be counting on his top guns to perform.
“I always expect our older players to perform well when you have competition like this,” Haley said. “This is the fourth year that our seniors have met Stanford, and all three of them have played all four years. It’s a constant battle to see who comes out on top. We’ve played these guys quite even and it’s been a sensational series, so I expect that to continue.”
Though he didn’t note any specific area of improvement ahead of Friday night’s tilt, Haley once again emphasized the need to keep improving against stiffer conference competition and praised his squad’s preparation.
“I know Stanford’s going to be really good, so we have some things that we’re trying to add that will be helpful,” Haley said. “Basically we’re just trying to get better at what we do. We’ve been working very hard with that.
Cal (8-3, 1-1) started off its season with six straight victories, but the Golden Bears have lost three of its last four games to fall out of the national rankings.
When the Bears do triumph, they do so in dominant fashion — all eight of their wins have been sweeps. Outside hitter Adrienne Gehan averages 4.35 kills per set to lead Cal in scoring.
But Haley is confident USC’s diligent preparation will yield positive results against their rivals from the Bay.
“I’m very pleased with the players’ attitudes and efforts so far,” Haley said. “They’ve been very good in their preparation, and I feel that we’re on the right page.”

The USC women’s soccer team returns to McAlister Field for two games this weekend, as the team will try to regroup after consecutive gut-wrenching losses. Washington will visit the Women of Troy for a 2 p.m. matchup this Friday, while Washington State will be in town for a 3 p.m. tilt on Sunday.
Indispensable · USC has outscored its opponents 11-2 in the three games that senior midfielder Jordan Marada has had a goal or assist. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
 
It will be another bounce back effort for USC, who suffered a 1-0 defeat to Arizona State last Sunday, a week after a 2-1 double overtime loss at the hands of Cal State Fullerton. The two losses dropped the team’s record to 5-4-1.
Senior defender Autumn Altimirano believes the losses have motivated her team going forward.
“We’ve always struggled with ASU, dating back to last season,” Altimirano said. “So losing to them instilled a fire in a lot of our players.”
Washington brings a 4-5-1 overall mark to Los Angeles, with a 1-1 tie against Oregon State being their only Pac-12 result. The squad will also be looking to regroup after a tough shutout loss to No. 14 Portland last week.
Spearheading the Husky offense is freshman Becca Shoales, whose three goal total leads a balanced attack that features five other goal scorers. Supporting Shoales are midfielders Lindsay Elston and Isabel Farrell, who both enter Friday’s game with four assists. On the defensive end, goalkeeper Megan Kufeld has amassed 33 saves, but has also allowed 10 goals in her 10 appearances.
Sophomore forward Katie Johnson said that a strong week of practice has the team physically and mentally prepared for this weekend’s contests.
“We’ve been working on possessing the ball a lot more,” Johnson said. “We’ve also been shooting and working on combining a lot of things together. We’ve changed the way we play to avoid some of the mistakes we made last week.”
Washington State has been enjoying an impressive 2013 season, recording an unbeaten 7-0-3 record thus far and landing just outside the NCAA top 25. While the Cougars have yet to face a ranked team, they do have a 1-0 victory over Cal State Fullerton, their one common opponent with the Women of Troy. In Wazzu’s only Pac-12 matchup so far, the squad played Oregon last week to a scoreless draw.
Senior forward Micaela Castain leads a formidable Cougar attack with 10 goals, tops in the Pac-12, and is also tied for the team lead with four assists. Goalkeeper Gurveen Claire has been stellar so far for Washington State in 2013. Incredibly, she has been scored upon only three times this season, in a 2-2 tie against Oklahoma and a 3-1 season-opening win over Seattle University. Claire has 18 saves for the Cougars, and her eight shutouts and 0.295 goals-against-average both rank among the nation’s leaders.
“We’re going to attack them hard,” Johnson said, referring to Washington State’s backline. “We’re going to attack the flanks and the middle, and just try to be confusing instead of predictable.”
“We’ve been preparing to play these types of teams all season.” USC head coach Ali Khosrohahin said.
Breaking through the Cougars’ tight defense could be a struggle for the Women of Troy, who have scored just once in their last two games. Even in the midst of this scoring drought, hope is certainly not lost on the offensive end for USC. The team scored four goals in each of their first three games, and five goals in a later game versus LMU.
Senior midfielder and leading scorer Elizabeth Eddy has returned from injury, and should be a major contributor this weekend. Including Eddy, five USC players have at least three goals on the season. Freshman Kayla Mills leads the team with four assists to go with her three scores. Getting back on track on offense has been a point of focus for the Women of Troy in practice.
“[Converting opportunities] is something we’ve been working on all season,” Khosroshahin said. “We’ve had some tough games to finish this season, and we hit a bit of a hiccup against ASU, but we’re determined to sort it out.”
On the defensive end, goalkeeper Caroline Stanley and her teammates have been more consistent, allowing multiple goals in only two games thus far. The USC backline, which routinely rotates between eight or nine players per game, has grown into one of the most cohesive units in the Pac-12. Altimirano has been not been surprised by the defense’s strong play.
“We have a bond in the back,” Altamirano said. “I think we’ll do anything to keep the ball out of the back of our net and that’s what’s keeping us strong.”
Both Washington and Washington State made runs to the NCAA playoffs in 2012, adding to the importance of this weekend series. The Women of Troy defeated the Huskies 1-0 at home last year, but took a 4-0 loss at Wazzou.
Both games will be televised live on the Pac-12 Network, with Friday’s commentary coming from former U.S. soccer star Cobi Jones.

Trailers are an ingrained part of the moviegoing experience now. Going into a theater, you know that the first 15 to 20 minutes or so after the posted start time are dedicated to trailers as opposed to the feature you paid to see.
As the lights dim for the start of the usually eight or so trailers to run, you begin to hear whispers of, “that looks good,” or, “I love that guy,” or, on the other hand, groans of disapproval. Coming in at around two and a half minutes, these trailers have become an enjoyable part of attending films, as opposed to what used to be seen as an inconvenience.
What makes them so popular? What about these glorified ads for other movies make them more appealing than the thousandth auto insurance ad you see while watching television? For starters, there is a sheen of novelty to them. It is inherently exciting to see the first trailer for an upcoming movie; it has an aura of possibility around it that most regular ads can’t match. In the case of a highly anticipated movie, for example Star Wars: Episode VII, due to come out in 2015. When the trailer is released, people will be analyzing it and breaking it down for any clues they can mine from the two minutes and 30 seconds of George Lucas’ table scraps. There is something else beyond the novelty aspect that has also ballooned the popularity of trailers, and funnily enough it is also just the thing that comes up as the number one complaint about them. Trailers fit a lot of information into those two and a half minutes, so much so that many people complain that some trailers give away the important parts of the movie, rendering surprises less impactful.
This point is hard to argue. Sure, there are movies that manage to keep their major plot points secret, but there are countless examples of movies revealing a good three-fourths of their plot arc or the five best jokes in the film through the few carefully selected snippets included in their trailers.
It’s frustrating at times because it takes away from the movie. They rarely give away the finale (though it has happened to some extent), but it is disappointing to be coming across scenes an hour and a half into the movie that you already knew were coming. This lessens the impact of the moment and robs it of the element of surprise.
In sacrificing this impact, however, the audience gets something else from the trailer: entertainment. They are almost like miniature movies. We are introduced to characters, we are shown what conflict they have to face and we are usually shown a pivotal point in the movie.
These mini-movies not only take advantage of the anticipation that they produce but also provide a shot of entertainment of their own accord. Earlier this year there were rumblings that the National Association of Theater Owners (yes, they go by NATO) was pushing for a reduction in the length of the trailers from 2:30 to 2:00, but didn’t succeed. The strongest driving force for this was the fact that research done by the studios conclusively said that the majority of audiences preferred the trailers of longer length -— in essence,  viewers prefer the straight sell over suspense.
The master of suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock, took a much different approach to the trailer. Perhaps his most iconic one was his trailer for the movie Psycho. In the trailer we see no footage from the movie or dramatic music; instead, we see old Hitch himself alone giving the audience a tour of the iconic Bates mansion and motel for a good six minutes, culminating with him tearing aside the shower curtain to reveal a screaming woman and the sudden appearance of the movie’s title across the screen. Instead of showing everything, the Psycho trailer is all a tease. It really epitomizes the intentions of most trailers from earlier in movie history (not going too far back to when the trailers actually trailed the film and came after the movie) in that they offered a taste but only enough to entice.
Trailers like Psycho’s still exist. They come in the form of teaser trailers. They’re usually only made for big-money productions but they can be plenty tantalizing when done right. One that really stood out was the teaser for Super 8  that came out in 2011. For a while, we were only given a brief but tasty glimpse of the movie. Of course later, the trailer came out and gave away half the plot. For a while there though, we saw how enticing trailers could still be without giving it all away, even though all that market research shows that they will never really go back.

In October 2003, Breaking Bad wasn’t airing on AMC, Justin Timberlake had his first hit solo album and the Walt Disney Concert Hall was being celebrated as a gleaming icon of Downtown Los Angeles.
In a decade of change, one thing has remained the same: The Walt Disney Concert Hall is still a Downtown L.A. landmark, and the famed venue will be celebrating its 10th Anniversary this year with the upcoming 2013-2014 season.
The hall, which stands on the corner of 1st Street and Grand Avenue, kicked off its season of celebration earlier this week, starting on Sunday with a free concert featuring the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Youth Orchestra Los Angeles and other guests.
The concert hall continued the festivities into Monday, which was the opening night for WDCH’s season, with a concert and gala that celebrated the start of the 10th anniversary festivities. Renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma played classical favorites, with selections from Bach, Tchaikovsky and Saint-Saens, alongside the Los Angeles Philharmonic. On the actual anniversary date, the L.A. Phil will play a world premiere of Frank Zappa’s 200 Motels on Oct. 23.
The celebration won’t stop there. The rest of the season is sure to spike insightful musical interest and fanciful fun with classical and jazz concerts by numerous special guests, one of which is USC’s very own Thornton Symphony.
In late November, the Los Angeles Philharmonic will present the Colburn Orchestra and members of the USC Thornton Symphony and the Thornton Choral Artists for the 100th anniversary of the birth of Benjamin Britten. James Conlon will conduct “War Requiem” by Britten as a part of the Britten 100/LA celebration at Renee and Henry Segerstrom Concert Hall in Costa Mesa, Calif. on Nov. 24, and again at Walt Disney Hall on Nov. 25. USC Thornton Symphony orchestra manager Josh Roach is excited to work with Conlon.
“It’s a great opportunity for the students to work with a world-class conductor, James Conlon, gain exposure to one of the great choral-orchestral repertoire pieces of the 20th century, and perform in two fantastic venues: Disney and Segerstrom,” Roach said.
The Los Angeles Philharmonic will be playing this concert as a part of their Sounds About Town series, one of their many concert series of the season.
Another event that is sure to excite is the Tchaikovskyfest. An eight-part concert series, Tchaikovskyfest will include various educational events in Los Angeles and end with a grand finale with both the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Simón Bolivar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela.
With larger-than-life intensity, music director Gustavo Dudamel will conduct Tchaikovsky symphonies with the L.A. Philharmonic.
“As a young boy, I discovered Tchaikovsky through great recordings and he has had a very special place in my heart ever since,” Dudamel said.
In light of the L.A. Philharmonic’s 2012 Mahler Project, the orchestra will collaborate with partner orchestra Simón Bolivar Symphony Orchestra to bring to life the work of Tchaikovsky during their series beginning in February 2014.
On top of a star-studded season, the Walt Disney Concert Hall is going a step further and is offering $10 tickets for select concerts throughout the season.
Some of the selected dates include an All-Beethoven concert, an organ recital by Hector Oliver and a special Halloween treat: live organ accompaniment to the film The Phantom of the Opera.
With some of these special offer concerts already sold out, these tickets are sure to be a hot commodity in the community. Elisa Ruiz, a graduate student studying opera performance, feels there’s plenty to be excited about.
“I would be excited about all of these concerts. This is a great array of music, however, I would be more interested in seeing Schubert’s symphony No. 4, and Tchaikovsky’s piano concerto No. 1, since I have never seen them performed,” Ruiz said.
If $10 is still too much (after all, that would buy you a whole steak salad at Seeds), USC’s Visions and Voices arts initiative is offering students the chance to see some of these grand concerts for free. The next opportunity is on Saturday, with buses leaving USC for the Walt Disney Concert Hall at 6:30 p.m. Advance reservations are full, but students can wait on standby the day of the event.
Editor’s note: This post has been edited to include the exact dates that members of the USC Thornton Symphony and the Thornton Choral Artists will perform with the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

In Brad Furman’s new film Runner Runner, starring Justin Timberlake and Anthony Mackie, the romantic notion of the American dream is expressed through the machinations of what Furman calls the “new American dream,” — the lavish life of the online gambling world.

“The American dream used to be about being rich and famous, but now it’s to become rich and famous — as quickly as possible,” Timberlake said in an interview. “People are constantly trying to reinvent the wheel, and things are moving at warp speed. It’s cutthroat. It’s very cerebral and less about integrity, pride or honor, or any moral values.”
Runner Runner tells the story of Princeton grad student Richie Furst (Justin Timberlake) who, after playing an online poker game, goes bust. Believing he’s been conned, Richie travels to Costa Rica to confront the online gambling mogul Ivan Block (Ben Affleck). Confronting Block only leaves Richie seduced by Block’s promise of immense wealth, until he learns the truth about Block’s benefactor. When FBI Agent Shavers (Anthony Mackie) tries to coerce Richie into helping bring Block and his associates down, Richie attempts to outmaneuver the two forces closing in on him.
If one were to put a mirror up to the audience’s faces, the reflection would probably look like the character Richie. The young generation of the film’s desired demographics are involved in everything from illegally downloading movies and music to Internet gambling, while supporting hacker groups such as Anonymous. Runner Runner suggests this generation believes that the rule of law has no place in the online world. Instead, they look to the supposed leaders in the business world who take shortcuts that are morally suspect — if not illegal — and tell themselves, “If they can do it, then so can I.”
“With [Runner Runner], it’s so bright and beautiful [and] you really give your character the opportunity to really go as far as they can into the world they live in without becoming superficial or unbelievable.” Mackie said. “You can track the characters and put yourself in their position throughout [Runner Runner].”
While working on Runner Runner, Timberlake and Mackie both saw the positives of portraying their respective characters. The actors, in different ways, found something rewarding through their filming experiences and working with each other.
“I loved the idea of Richie, this character who’s a good guy, he’s trying to do the right thing but he’s got himself into a hole,” Timberlake said. “It’s kind of the idea of trying to dig yourself out of a hole, but you just keep digging yourself deeper and deeper into that hole. You know, I identify with a lot of things about him.”
Mackie found his portrayal of Agent Shavers just as rewarding, but his gratifying experience comes from acting with his co-star as well as playing the nontraditional black role.
“For me, it was more so I enjoyed the ability to really just push Justin around,” Mackie said. “My character is such a bully in this movie, and I’m never given the opportunity to grow out my facial hair and look crazy and sweaty and smack up white dudes. So when I’m given that opportunity, I go for that 100 percent.”
Working with Mackie, Timberlake also saw the advantages of working with characters with complex relationships.
Runner Runner ultimately gave the chance for both Timberlake and Mackie to grow as actors. From working with Oscar winner Ben Affleck to the detailed technicalities of the script, both actors took their experience working with each other seriously and that is what will ultimately show on the screen.
“I learned so much because when you’re running down hallways and doing all that crazy stuff it’s so easy — like we’re hanging [Justin] out of a building two stories in the air, we literally could have dropped him on his head,” Mackie said. “You know, there’s just so much stuff going on that if you’ve never experienced that as an actor you kind of have to roll with the flow.”
Similarly, Timberlake found value in the way the film’s characters were written.
“What I like about every character is that in a movie like this it could easily be in a way, ‘genrefied,’” Timberlake said. “It could easily become cliché … What I love about how this was written, not only is my character intelligent, but Ben’s character is intelligent, Anthony’s character is intelligent, Gemma [Arterton]’s character is intelligent. You know, it just elevates the material.”
With a story such as Runner Runner, the importance lies in what the audience gets out of the film and how the audience reacts to the action being portrayed onscreen. Timberlake notes that in his job as an actor he had to come to the realization of what’s being spoken though the film.
“I didn’t realize that online gaming was so huge, and I didn’t realize that so much money was being generated from it down in Costa Rica,” Timberlake said. “So, the more I learned about the world … It felt very fresh, this movie, because you felt like you were making a movie about something that was happening right now.”
 
The film Runner Runner opens in theaters today.

On Sept. 10, U.S. News and World Report released their annual “Best Colleges” list. This time, however, there were significant deviations from past lists. Princeton University, ranked as the top school in the nation, dethroned Harvard University — the long-standing premier college in the country. Other shifts within the charts incited an array of reactions from the public.
Many people love to consult top 10 lists of everything from songs to restaurants to help them make decisions. These rankings, however, create definitive quality and value, making the subjective “best,” “sub-par” and “worst” very black and white. But the case is very different when it comes to collegiate rankings. When a hierarchy is imposed upon something as vital as education, especially high-stakes, high-price higher education, it creates a mindset that fixates more on numbers and standings and less about the collegiate experience.
For the past 30 years, U.S. News grades institutions based on criteria that they can change every year. According to the Huffington Post, factors that contribute to the valued system this year include reputation, student retention, faculty resources, exclusivity, money, graduation rate performance and alumni giving, with each element weighing differently in this quest to classify colleges. For example, reputation comprises 22.5 percent of the overall score, while alumni donations account for 5 percent.
Moreover, what is heavily evaluated is the quality of students based on their standardized test scores and high school class rank, not what the students learn once they arrive on campus. This algorithm, though, is oversimplified and faulty. Princeton might be the top college in the nation, and an acceptance definitely symbolizes achievement, but that does not necessarily mean that Princeton is the top college for every rising freshman in the nation. ABC News reported that this year there was less significance given to a school’s student body and an increase in the weight of how well a school educates its students.
Additionally, the financial and occupational prospects of graduates remain missing from U.S. News’ radar. In an economy still recovering from its worst recession since the Great Depression, students are more anxious than ever about finding employment immediately following graduation. To combat the downfalls of the U.S. News methodology, even President Barack Obama has stepped in to fill in the holes. In a speech at University of Buffalo last month, Obama proposed a government-facilitated evaluation accounting for student debt, graduation rates and earnings, among other margins. Other specialists have proposed a “best bang for the buck” system, designed to satiate frugal families.
But even these new propositions fail to emphasize the abundance of other facets of college life. Nowhere in U.S. News does it mention USC’s strong study abroad programs or enlightening lectures by renowned professors. Because of these omissions, it’s quite obvious that college rankings should not play such a major role in an  applicant’s decision. Those who wish to attend a school of higher education  should not have to feel pressured to choose the so-called “best” school. Instead, a student needs to choose whichever school works best for them personally.
To prospective college students, now seniors in high school fervidly filling out their applications: The numbers don’t determine the experience.

When does US News release the annual fraternity rankings?
I wish they would factor in attractiveness and social awkwardness.  In recent years, SC has cornered the market at the opposite ends of spectrum…
Good stuff DANNI WANG..  Fight ON!!!
“…it creates a mindset that fixates more on numbers and standings…”
Yeah, it’s called objectivity.
How do you objectively measure the factor “reputation”? Please do not answer with SCI publications… only China still believes in this. Check the Economist article on the topic. 
I think all these rankings are BS and mainly suited for parents to show off with. Especially for graduate work, it is much more important to identify the right department/university by its actual research focus and how well it fits to one’s own planned academic work.

When 24-year-old Jonathan Ferrell stepped out his front door on a Saturday morning in North Carolina, he never expected to run into a chain of bad luck. He never expected to damage his car in a car accident, become the victim of a vicious manslaughter event, nor end up dead at the hands of an official whose duty was to protect white and black men alike. Unfortunately, when Jonathan Ferrell kissed his fiancée goodbye on that gray morning, he didn’t know much at all.
Yiwen Fu | Daily Trojan
The nationally reported case that has drawn attention from both “post-racial” conservatives and liberals alike began with a frantic 911 call from Sarah McCartney, 32, who claimed that a black man was attempting to break into her home. After the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department arrived on scene, they were faced with a young man, matching the correct description, stumbling towards them, unarmed and helpless. And instead of acting with rational cause, officer Randall Kerrick used excessive force against Ferrell. And unbeknownst to the public, Kerrick, and many other officials, are not being rightfully punished for the crime.
The  recent release of a 911 tape is the latest twist in a case that has gathered controversial views from all sides of the political and social spectrum. According to the latest police reports, Ferrell, still in shock from a car collision, was in need of urgent assistance.
Whatever the case might be, we now know the answers to some of the most contentious questions surrounding Ferrell’s death. Was Ferrell armed? No. Was he believed to be dangerous? No. So why murder an innocent man without just cause? It is this unrelenting concern that leads many to believe that Kerrick was predisposed to murdering a black man. When asked to comment on the case, local Charlotte Mecklenburg NAACP President Rev. Kojo Nantambu said the killing “smells more of hatred and rage” than any valid cause which would justify an officer pointing a gun at a man who was pleading for a helping hand. Some activists repeatedly contacted the city’s review board, discovering numerous other shootings involving the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department that resulted in four deaths.
Social psychologist Claude Steele’s book Whistling Vivaldi: How Stereotypes Affect Us and What We Can Do revolutionized today’s view of racial preconception, and the cognitive means of intolerance. Many leading social theorists have called one particular idea “respectability politics,” a proposal to resolve many of our generation’s social issues.
This very concept of respectability politics relies on the idea that a person of color would act according to the predetermined standards of a middle-class white man or woman, and would ‘signal’ respectability. This notion has manifested itself in Jonathan Ferrell’s case. In an MSNBC interview, Ferrell’s family attorney remarked on the kind of man Ferrell was, and stated: “He’s engaged to be married, he has a dog and a cat, he was driving a Toyota Camry, he survived an accident, had 3.7 GPA and he was a chemistry major. This is not someone who posed a threat to the officers or anyone else, this is an everyday American.”
The shooting itself came just months after a national conversation regarding racial profiling was sparked by the trial of George Zimmerman, who was tried for the murder of Trayvon Martin. Since President Barack Obama was elected, many journalists, television personalities and social critics have claimed that we are now living in a “post-racial society.” When the term was first introduced, the idea sounded absurd. But it was not long before this concept became the new mainstream of a culture which had forgotten all the work Martin Luther King Jr., Betty Friedan, and more have done in history.
This case proves the idea is just not true. In a ‘post-racial society,’ a policeman put in charge of protecting our citizens would have asked questions. He would not have killed a man whose intentions were questionable. As Obama said in his speech to the American public on July 19, there is a “history of racial disparities” in the execution of our criminal rulings. Moreover, it remains unclear whether society has moved past racial bias, or worked in any way to eliminate it.
If Kerrick were to explain his actions on that Saturday night, he would allude to uncertainty, fear and safety procedures. What he wouldn’t dare mention is the predisposed thought that a black man is a serious threat.
When Ferrell stood on one side of the door of a complete stranger, he was looking for a kind soul to answer. On the other side was McCartney who slammed the door shut and shattered the last remaining hope of one man’s American Dream.

An interesting writing written from one side based on hindsight and a view of what happened independent of the moment and through the lenses of what is wrong with the US.  What happened was a tragedy but with little consideration for the point of view of the officer.  
Playing devil’s advocate but: A report of someone attempting to break in someone’s resident (is he armed, is he dangerous, did he escape from somewhere), allegedly the cop told him to get down but Mr. Ferrell continues to charge (multiple articles states that he had one hand behind his back.  Is he going for a weapon, am I or the residents around me in danger?).  One cop fired a Taser but this person who hasn’t said anything (deduced) is still advancing, (I don’t know if the cop realized if the Taser missed or is there a concern that he is still advancing even after hit by the Taser).
This is not a case where a guy in a suit, is standing around saying, “Hey Cop, I was in an auto incident down the road and would like some assistance.  I’m disoriented and concern I may need some medical assistance” before the cop pulls out his guns and fires.   Hindsight is nice in the safety of our offices, but at the moment of incident and with the information provided to the officer previously (how much more information do we not have).  Sometimes a bad situation just happens ( ie sometimes a cigar is just a cigar).
One final note, although there is racism in the world still today.  I truly wonder, do we see racism all around us because we are looking for racism to prove that it still exists and in order to endeavor to prevent it.
“And unbeknownst to the public, Kerrick, and many other officials, are not being rightfully punished for the crime.”
It is my understanding that Kerrick has manslaughter charges filed against him.  We can wait until after a trial to punish, can we not?  But no, you have already made up your mind that this was a race based incident without hearing the officer out.   And what other officials?  Kerrick pulled the trigger.  It’s my understanding no one else fired.  So what are “many other officials” to be punished for?
Brilliantly articulated. A vastly insightful piece that illuminates the ever-blurring lines between racism and public safety in this complicated era. The author’s lucid and poignant analysis works in tandem with her astonishing writing ability to put into perspective what could be one of the most important developing issues of our time.
