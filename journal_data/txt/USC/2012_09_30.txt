The USC women’s soccer team completed a wild weekend in Arizona with two double-overtime games, fighting to a 1-1 tie in an intense game against Arizona on Sunday and losing a close one in Tempe to Arizona State 5-4 on Friday.
“Our fitness really came through today,” said USC coach Ali Khosroshahin when asked about a pair of weekend games in the Arizona weather. “It’s hard to play in this kind of weather at 2:00 and 1:30 both matches.“

In Sunday’s game, freshman forward Whitney Pitalo slipped a shot past Arizona goalkeeper Gabby Kaufman in the first half, tipping in a pass from freshman midfielder April Juarez to give USC (4-5-2) a 1-0 lead. The Women of Troy stayed aggressive, stopping the Arizona offense on numerous occasions and generating numerous scoring opportunities, with junior midfielder Elizabeth Eddy and freshman forward Katie Johnson getting into 1-on-1 chances against Kaufman. But Kaufman was able to stop both attempts.
A USC foul set up a free kick for forward Jazmin Ponce of the Wildcats in the 88th minute. Jazmin kicked it into the box, where midfielder Jessica Culver was able to tap it into the goal to tie the game at one and send the game into overtime.
The Women of Troy looked determined throughout the overtime period, constantly attacking the goal and keeping the ball on Arizona’s side of the field. Johnson, junior midfielder Haley Boysen and freshman forward Megan Borman all had good looks at the net, but Kaufman stopped them all, causing the final whistle to blow after 110 minutes of play in a tie game.
USC also played an overtime match on Friday night against Arizona State.
Throughout the match USC struggled to contain forward Cali Farquharson, who posted a hat trick in regulation and set up midfielder Tommi Goodman with the game-winning goal in the second overtime. Farquharson scored both goals in the first half for the Sun Devils, including a tally five minutes after Boysen scored in the 22nd minute, giving the Sun Devils a 2-1 lead at halftime.
A shot by Johnson in the 31st minute that appeared to pass the goal line was nabbed by Arizona State goalkeeper Chandler Morris before the referees noticed. The Pac-12 Networks’ broadcast would later clearly show it crossing the line.
After ASU scored opened a 3-1 lead, the Women of Troy came back from a two-goal deficit for the third time in their last four games, thanks to a pair of goals by sophomore midfielder Alex Quincey. Farquharson scored her third goal in the 86th minute to give ASU the lead, but junior midfielder Autumn Altamirano answered with an equalizer in the 89th minute.
The Women of Troy were undone by late ejections, including Khosroshahin, senior forward Samantha Johnson and Altamirano, leaving them with nine players on the field for the overtime period.
Despite holding off ASU in the first overtime, Goodman was able to score off a rebound in the 101st minute.
Arizona State outshot the Women of Troy 35-14 and won 9-4 in corner kicks. Sophomore goalkeeper Caroline Stanley finished with a career-high 12 saves.
“Considering all that happened on Friday, the ladies showed great determination and fight,” said coach Khosroshahin said about the team’s performance this weekend.
USC heads back to Los Angeles for a couple days rest before taking a trip to Oregon next weekend. The Women of Troy will play Oregon State at 1 p.m. on Friday, followed by a 1 p.m. match against at Oregon on Sunday. The game against the Beavers will be televised on Pac-12 Networks, marking the fourth-straight USC game that will be televised.

The bye week not only provides teams with much- needed rest, but also provides a break for fans. I spent the majority of Saturday posted up on my couch, watching teams I don’t normally watch, seeing what I could learn. The first game is the one that really caught my eye: Baylor at West Virginia.
Now, I knew that this was going to be a shootout. But 70-63 as the final score? When a team scores 70 points, you don’t normally expect a close game.
West Virginia quarterback Geno Smith threw for 656 yards and eight touchdown passes. One of his receivers had 303 yards receiving. Yet the game still came down to a single touchdown.
I hadn’t seen a shootout like that in a while, and didn’t figure I would for some time, either. It was the Big 12; effective defensive play is sparse.
Then the Tennessee-Georgia game came on, and the supposedly stout SEC defenses each gave up 40 points. As I watched the offensive fireworks bolstered by poor defensive efforts, I really started to appreciate the job that USC assistant head coach and defensive guru Monte Kiffin has done.
Kiffin has gotten some flack over the years, and the defense hasn’t necessarily been up to USC standards the last few seasons. USC’s biggest question marks heading into this season dealt with the defense, specifically the defensive line.
But when it comes down to it, considering  the feeble defense on display Saturday, Monte has done a pretty good job.
Consider this: The most points the Trojans have given up this season is 29; even in their loss at Stanford, they gave up just 21. They are giving up an average of 17.3 points per game on the season. By comparison, Oregon, the No. 2 team in the entire country, is giving up 19.8 points a contest. Analysts praise Oregon defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti for the job he is doing for the Ducks, but Kiffin hasn’t gotten near the credit he deserves.
Let’s take a look at some of the top teams in the country and their defenses.
We know Alabama is playing great football, and we’ve discussed Oregon. LSU is giving up 12.6 points per game, South Carolina is giving up just over 11. Kansas State is giving up 15.5, and Notre Dame is giving up nine points per game.
These are among the best teams in the country, and Kiffin’s defense is not that far behind some of these teams. West Virginia? After yesterday’s stellar effort, they are giving up almost 33 points a game; for reference, that is close to what USC scores per game.
When it comes down to it, the Trojans have been a mild disappointment thus far in the young season. They were supposed to be undefeated, and weren’t really supposed to be tested until the Oregon game on Nov. 3.
A lot of people have blamed the team’s slow start on a lack of pass protection and a general lack of offensive production. But more often that not, the finger gets pointed at the defense.
Watching a handful of games  yesterday, I saw some of the best teams in the country giving up 30, 40 and 60 points. National-title-contending defenses? Hardly.
This weekend made me optimistic for USC’s chances. We probably won’t see the Trojans give up 63 points in a win, because the odds of them putting up more than that are kind of slim. Kiffin himself said West Virginia stats are tough to achieve.
But the fact of the matter is that the USC defense is too good to give up that many points. They are too disciplined, have too much pride and are too well-coached. They might not win the rest of the games on their schedule, but it won’t be because they are giving up 40 points to mediocre teams a lá West Virginia or Georgia.
No, this weekend allowed me to sit back and respect the job that Kiffin has done. Seventeen points a game allowed is pretty good, considering the Trojans have played three of those games on the road.
They aren’t going to blow you away with stats, and they’ll probably end up giving up closer to 20 points a game by season’s end. But I take solace in knowing that Kiffin’s stout defense that can stop the run and get the ball back for Barkley and Co.
Monte and the Trojans have a defense that is holding up its end of the deal; shootouts are unlikely, except for maybe the Oregon game. And watching yesterday’s games made me appreciate the fact that I likely won’t have to watch many offensive shootouts.
The Trojans will undoubtedly play some close games, but it won’t be of the West Virginia-Baylor variety. And for that, I am thankful; my heart can’t take that sort of stress, anyway.
 
“Goal Line Stand” runs every Monday. If you would like to comment on this story, visit DailyTrojan.com or email Michael at katzml@usc.edu.
The USC defense is playing better than the offense, but both have to get a lot better. The key to the team’s success this season is going to be the OL. If it plays well the offense will get untracked and that will help the defense by keeping them on the field less and allowing more aggressive play.

For the first time since training camp, No. 13 USC conducted a full practice on a Sunday afternoon.
USC plays Thursday at 6 p.m., so the practice schedule has been a little bit different the past few days, with no practice Thursday but one on Friday.

USC coach Lane Kiffin maintains that, despite the time off because of the bye week, the intensity at practice has been at a high level.
“We’ve done our best to really coach extremely hard and really get on them,” Kiffin said. “[We] wanted to make sure they really felt our intensity here and I think our staff did a good job of that.”
Kiffin said that Sunday’s practice was highlighted by the defense, specifically by the defensive front, which was especially stout in its contest against Cal on Sept. 22 after being exposed against Stanford the week before.
“I thought the defense practiced really well today,” Kiffin said. “After having a day off [which is] unusual, it was good. I thought we really came out, especially the defensive front … because any time you go on the road for a conference team, you’re going to need that.”
The coaching staff and players acknowledge that Thursday’s game is going to have a lot of spotlight on it, as it will be the only Football Bowl Subdivision game going on that day. Kiffin also knows that Utah has highlighted the game, with reporters at Pac-12 media day citing it as one of the school’s biggest games of the year.
“I think that anytime when no other game’s going and everybody’s going to watch you, it becomes more of a statement game for the team that’s considered the underdog,” Kiffin said.
—
With the weekend off, coaches and players had the chance to catch football from around the country, including Saturday’s West q game, which featured nearly 700 passing yards and eight scoring tosses from West Virginia quarterback Geno Smith.
“I kind of saw the numbers as it was going on,” Kiffin said. “I don’t know how you do that. It’s just amazing. I was talking to [junior wide receiver Robert Woods and sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee] and said ‘It’s hard to do that [against] air or a service team.’”
Woods was also impressed by the efforts of the West Virginia offense when he watched the game’s highlights.
“A great offense putting up great numbers,” Woods said. “Back and forth on both sides, a great job to them.”
—
The Trojans’ opponents to date have had a rough go of it this season, sporting a combined 6-11 record, with three of those victories coming from Stanford. Kiffin does not compare the teams USC has already played to those that appear later on the schedule and pays the comparisons no mind.
“I think that comparing games, and who you play … I just don’t think that that means very much,” Kiffin said. “We shouldn’t go play Washington then because we’re going to lose to them because they beat Stanford and we lost to Stanford.”

The No. 3 USC women’s volleyball team overcame a mini-slump Sunday, dispatching of the Washington State Cougars 3-0 for its 14th win and 10th sweep of the season.
Ahead of the curve · Freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio led USC in its three-set sweep of Washington State with 15 kills at a blistering .367 clip. The 17-year-old continues to pace the Women of Troy’s potent attack. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy, who entered the game having been swept back-to-back by Oregon and Washington, put together a strong attack against the Cougars, overcoming a tough first set to win 26-24, 25-18, 25-20 and record their sixth consecutive win against Washington State.
“I think we were prepared Friday, we just didn’t get it done,” sophomore setter Hayley Crone said. “I think we got our confidence back today and worked our way through the game.”
Freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio paced the team once again, turning in another strong performance with a team-high 15 kills.
Bricio added seven digs and two key blocks, including one that sealed the first set, while attacking at a steady .367 clip. Senior opposite Katie Fuller notched 10 kills to support Bricio, while the Women of Troy also received solid performances from junior outside hitter Sara Shaw (eight kills and 11 digs) and junior middle blocker Alexis Olgard (six blocks and six kills). Crone notched 36 assists to stabilize the team’s attack.
The first set was tightly contested, as the teams traded points back and forth before the Women of Troy staked themselves to a 14-9 lead.
After the Cougars fought back to push a 19-all tie, the Women of Troy again took the lead at 22-20, but WSU recorded a flurry of kills to hold set point at 24-23.
Bricio came up big, however, blocking a Cougar attack for her seventh kill of the set to tie the match at 24 apiece. Bricio then followed a WSU error with a solo block to claim the first set for the Women of Troy, who uncharacteristically struggled to a .143 hitting percentage in the set.
“That was a wild first game, no doubt about it,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “But we had fun, and we took care of what we needed to take care of offensively and defensively.”
The second set was more relaxing for the visitors, who once again overcame an early struggle to take the set 25-18.
Sophomore setter Emily Young’s kill ignited a 5-0 run for the Women of Troy, who went up 14-8 before shortly extending their lead to 19-10 as Crone set up senior middle blocker Natasa Siljkovic for a kill to put the game out of reach. The Women of Troy saw a marked improvement offensively in the second set, hitting .367 while holding the Cougars to .125 and 11 kills.
After a Bricio kill put the Women of Troy up 6-3 in the final set, the team never looked back, holding the lead the entire way through to claim the sweep.
WSU then brought the deficit down to 8-7, Fuller turned back a block for the kill to go up 14-9.
The team eventually widened its gap to 20-11. After a Shaw kill put the Women of Troy up 23-18, Bricio earned set point before Olgard finished off a Crone pass to seal the victory.
While the hitting once again struggled, the third set was the team’s best defensive performance of the game, as the Women of Troy held the Cougars to a paltry .025 attack percentage.
Looking forward, Haley is pleased with his team’s performance amid an unusual stretch of adversity.
“I think, offensively, we’re fine,” Haley said. “Our setter [Crone] is constantly learning new things and is getting better. It’s a lot of responsibility and she has to learn to relax more while she’s playing, but she was better and better today. She’s taken a lot of responsibility for the last two losses and unfairly I think, because the responsibility has to be shared by the entire team.”
Crone is confident in the team’s prospects entering next weekend’s matchups at the Galen Center.
“We haven’t played Arizona and Arizona State yet, so we don’t exactly know what to expect,” Crone admitted. “But we just need to remain consistent and, if we stick to our game plan, we’ll be fine.”
The team will return home this week to face Arizona Friday at 7 p.m. before a Sunday matchup against Arizona State at 4 p.m.

Support for Proposition 30, Gov. Jerry Brown’s initiative to raise income taxes on the wealthy sales tax, has decreased since May, according to the latest USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times Poll.
Fifty-five percent of registered voters reported support for the measure, down from 59 percent last May. The September poll shows that 36 percent oppose the initiative and 9 percent remain undecided.
“From looking at the results of this poll, while the Governor’s initiative is still passing, it remains very vulnerable,” said Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC.
According to Schnur, the last time people voted to impose tax increases on a majority of the population was in 1993.
Polling results also showed that the strongest support for Prop. 30 comes from the 18 to 29 age group.
Makana Krulce, a sophomore majoring in chemical engineering, said she believes that Prop. 30 is a fair way to ease some of California’s financial pain.
“Low-income groups are suffering the most right now, so I feel that the wealthy should have to pay their fair share to fix our state’s problems,” Krulce said. “Also, if Californians take personal responsibility for some of the deficits, there will be less budget cuts to important programs, like education.”
Proposition 38, millionaire Molly Munger’s initiative to increase state income taxes for public schools, early childhood development programs and debt reduction, is supported by 34 percent of voters and opposed by 52 percent, according to the poll.
Schnur said that at this margin, it is rare for a proposition’s support to increase enough to pass by Election Day.
The poll also asked voters about how satisfied they were with new changes to the pension system that were recently signed into law by Brown. The changes included limiting pensions for new employees and raising the retirement age. Forty-five percent of voters said that the new law is a good start, but 39 percent feel that the new measures do not go far enough.
The poll surveyed more than 1,500 registered voters from Sept. 17-23. All polling was conducted by bipartisan interviewers to ensure unbiased results. The newest poll’s margin of error was 2.9 percent, according to Schnur.
The poll also surveyed opinions on several other issues, including propositions to change laws concerning criminal justice and genetically modified food.
The latest poll found that Californians favor Proposition 36, which would reform the three-strikes law to make it more lenient. According to the poll, 66 percent of registered reporters support the measure and 20 percent oppose it.
“Californians are looking for ways to save money and imposing shorter sentences on non-violent offenders appears to be a reasonable way to reduce prison costs,” Schnur said in a statement. “The challenge for the initiative’s opponents is to convince voters that prisoners who have previously committed violent crimes are still dangerous, but that looks like an uphill fight at this point.”
When it came to banning the death penalty, however, respondents to the poll were less open to change.
According to the poll, Proposition 34, a measure to eliminate the death penalty is supported by 38 percent of registered voters and opposed by 51 percent.
The poll also discovered that 61 percent of registered voters support Proposition 37, which would require labeling for foods with genetically modified ingredients. Twenty-five percent of registered voters oppose the measure and 14 percent said they were undecided or did not answer the poll.
“Something called genetically modified food sounds really scary, so it’s not surprising that the support for [Prop. 37] is this large,” Schnur said to the Los Angeles Times.
VOTE YES ON PROP 30!!!!!

In an effort to establish an innovative academic program in the Middle East, the USC School of Cinematic Arts has officially reached an agreement to work with Effat University in Saudi Arabia for the development of an academic program in Media and Digital Production, SCA announced Tuesday.
Digital · A collaboration between USC’s Institute of Multimedia Literacy and Effat University in Saudi Arabia aims to increase media literacy through a new program. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
USC has started the process of undergoing a major project on implementing media programs in Saudi Arabia, culminating in the announcement to collaborate with Effat University, an all-female school located in the heart of Saudi Arabia.
Beginning in September 2013, USC’s Institute for Multimedia Literacy will lead the project, developing the program’s curriculum. According to a statement from the School of Cinematic Arts, both USC and Effat “will work hand-in-hand to train mediamakers in the use of the moving image to convey stories, experiences and information to advance the scholarship of news media.”
IML Academic Director Holly Willis said the prospective program began when representatives of Effat University contacted USC about pursuing a curriculum in relation to the evolving digital age.
“They were interested in pursuing a curriculum that would not only be a mix of digital story-telling and journalism, but also thinking more broadly about digital media, including game design and immersive media,” Willis said.
Willis explained that the mission of this collaboration is to help people abroad become more digitally literate, especially at a time when technology is booming.
“The main goal of the program is to create an undergraduate curriculum for the women who attend Effat University in order to help the students become skilled in communicating with diverse forms of media,” Willis said.
Echoing Willis, USC’s Alan Baker, associate dean for international projects, said the program’s main purpose is to train students to get more practical digital media experience.
“The primary goal is to train the young women in various areas of multimedia so that they will have professional opportunities when they graduate,” Baker said. “It will give them an enormous amount of skills that they could use to work in a variety of areas in both electronic and print media.”
Effat University has welcomed the collaboration with open arms. Her Royal Highness Princess Lolowah bint Faisal Al Saud explained the significance of this collaboration as a vitally important step forward in keeping up with the digital age, according to a press release.
“It is very important to us, as a very old country, to be working with something new. We have boosted education to a very high level and I know how important this is to the future,” Al Saud said.
Many USC students were equally excited about collaborating with an all-female school.
“I think it’s awesome,” Elizabeth Sebastian, a sophomore majoring in critical studies, said. “This says so much about how women are just as important and talented as men and are just as helpful in society.”
Shannon Currie, a junior majoring in psychology with a minor in cinematic arts, however, had concerns about safety but believes USC has taken that factor into consideration.
“I trust that USC established a program that is safe and thought-out,” Currie said.
“I don’t think they’d do something like this unless they’ve gotten the grasp of what the ramifications would be.”
These concerns, however, remain an issue for the school, as journalism can often carry negative connotations in the Middle East.
An expert in the politics and culture of the Middle East, professor of international relations Laurie Brand, emphasized the concerns USC must take into consideration to preserve academic freedom for the program’s students and faculty.
“There aren’t as many protections for students and faculty over there as compared to here,” Brand said. “Academic freedom in the region is tentative at best.”
At this early point of developing the program, however, administrators are focused on developing the curriculum for the women of Effat University.
Willis said they hope to forge an innovative collaboration where both students and faculty gain from the two-way communication between USC and Effat University.
“We’re learning as much from our students in the sense of global leadership as they’re learning from us,” said Willis.

A few blocks away from USC, the transcript office of one high school is bustling.
“Every day since Aug. 14, we’ve been swamped with requests for transcripts from graduates, about 45 to 50 per day,” said Gwen Session, office technician of Foshay Learning Center.
The Foshay Learning Center is one of three high schools included in USC’s family of 15 local schools with education and health outreach programs.
A month after the inception of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, schools like Foshay in the Los Angeles Unified School District are facing an inundation of requests for transcripts. Deferred action is aimed to allow undocumented youth brought to the United States illegally by their parents temporary deferral from deportation.
The policy grants youth two years’ eligibility to stay in the United States and authorization to work, but unlike the DREAM Act that was not passed into law, it is not a permanent pathway to citizenship.
More than 2,300 students in LAUSD have requested transcripts to apply for deferred action. The district has an estimated 200,000 students registered who listed another country as their birthplace who could be potentially eligible for this program.
“I see it as a positive step as an incentive to finish high school, but at the same time it only grants two years of work,” said Maria Cuevas, a sophomore studying geological sciences at USC who graduated from Foshay.
Cuevas said she has a number of peers who she only recently discovered were brought to the United States as children.
“It’s a step, but not enough, especially if you would like to pursue higher education — I would hope to see a pathway for citizenship from the next presidential candidate,” Cuevas said.
Those eligible for deferred action include youth under 30 who have lived in the United States since they were 16, lived in the United States since 2007 and have received a high school diploma or GED or have served in the military. Recipients also need a clean criminal record and the ability to pay the application’s $465 fee.
The policy is “still an expression of the federal government’s belief that someone’s labor can be legal while the person is not,” said Dominic Powell, an activist of National Immigrant Youth Alliance.
Others, however, saw the policy as a step forward for immigration reform.
“I think it’s really good that this happened. It doesn’t solve our immigration problem but it will help boost the economy. Deferred action will allow youth to get a job and improve society for two years. What it is important is what it stands for,” said Alma Lemus, assistant chair of Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success, an on-campus group intended to support undocumented students in completing their education.
Lemus is also an assistant at Hermandad Mexicana Nacional, an organization that aims to help youth with their deferred action application process. Los Angeles County has 15 offices where residents can turn in applications, and all of them have been filled since the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services began accepting applications in August.
“We’ve been receiving the most people I’ve ever seen coming in for information and advice starting before August 15 — probably 40 or 50 people per day,” Lemus said.
Community organizations such as Hermandad Mexicana Nacional and the Coalition for Human Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles are helping families with the paperwork and encouraging people to apply before the presidential inauguration in January, in case of a change in president or legislature. CHIRLA’s Downtown office in MacArthur Park has seen 200-300 people a day, many of whom are college graduates.
Lemus pointed out that deferred action opens up significantly more opportunities for students who have graduated from college.
“Usually an undocumented college graduate would otherwise be forced to go back to a low-income job such as on the farm, factory or construction that doesn’t serve up to their title,” Lemus said. “Now for at least two years they can use their degree and find a job that fits their skills.”
How come this old lady keeps posting?  This isn’t the LA Times Ethel!
This is not the “Dream Act” but is a step in the right direction. There is one thing about the policy that I don’t quite get.
One of the qualifications is to have served in the armed forces. Don’t you have to be at least a green card holder (legal resident) to serve in the military?

This upcoming term, the Supreme Court will be trying its hand at international law. People around the world will be watching the United States’ highest court as the justices decide whether foreign victims of human rights abuses will be able to seek civil redress for their grievances in U.S. courts.
Yiwen Fu | Daily Trojan
But cases of human rights abuses by the U.S. government itself indicate that we might not be ready to focus our efforts outside U.S. borders. If the United States is truly to be regarded as a guardian of human rights for all, we must not neglect cases in which our own government has acted questionably overseas.
The recent case of Al-Aulaqi v. Panetta, which is currently pending before the court, raises the question not merely of whether the United States can protect foreign individuals from human rights abuses by foreign actors, but whether they can protect their own citizens from U.S. government abuses.
The case involves a suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights in response to the alleged targeted killing of an American teenager in Yemen in 2011.
The teen, Abdulrahman al-Aulaqi, was sitting at an open-air restaurant when a U.S. drone strike killed him and six innocent bystanders, including al-Aulaqi’s teenage cousin. Not only did innocent civilians die as collateral damage in a U.S.-sponsored attack, but the target of the operation — a 16-year-old American citizen who had lived in Colorado until the age of seven — was deprived of any semblance of due process before being violently killed by his own government.
Regardless of any national security concerns or intelligence gathered, he should have had the opportunity to face his accusers in a court of law before being assassinated by his own government.
If we cannot protect our own citizens from arbitrary exhibitions of power, then how can we credibly claim to be the guardians of the rights of non-citizens abroad?
The fact that al-Aulaqi was not only an American citizen, but also a minor barely old enough to be tried in American adult courts, also reflects poorly on the government.
Of course, we cannot reasonably expect the government to cease targeted killings altogether. As unfavorable an idea as it is, targeted killing does play an important role in protecting our nation and its allies from dangerous foreign operatives.
Someone has to do the dirty work to protect our nation and our associated institutions abroad from attack, but we must ensure that such measures are invoked only as a last resort.
Al-Aulaqi was not so immediate a threat as to necessitate a targeted killing operation — especially an operation that cost six innocent bystanders their lives.
Furthermore, for the government to deprive one of its own from his Fifth Amendment right to due process of law is utterly unacceptable and flies in the face of everything America stands for as a nation.
Before using our judicial system to punish those abroad for their human rights infractions, we must first fix the flaws of our own system. If we are to maintain any credibility as a democratic nation and custodian of human rights, we must first look inward and end such barbaric actions as the killing of American citizens without due process of the law.
The Supreme Court’s impending case regarding human rights for foreign nationals is undoubtedly a step forward for the global preservation of human rights.
Cases such as the killing of al-Aulaqi, however, should make us question whether our government can legitimately adjudicate on these rights at all, or whether it would just be another empty promise and display of hypocrisy.
If those responsible for al-Aulaqi’s death are not held accountable by our justice system, this and other injustices will ultimately undermine the democratic rule of law that is so vital to our nation.

US law states that it is a federal crime to discriminate against an individual based on their national origin.  Yet, US Law, FATCA, is now pressuring the nations of the world to discriminate against Americans abroad simply because they are US persons.  Now, many Americans abroad are being denied financial services simply because they are Americans, due to US policy.  The US government is thus pressuring the world to be criminal against the American people.  One would think that it should be the other way around, but it is not.
The United States can’t even take care of it’s own citizens! So they wanna spend more of our tax dollars to punish leaders of other countries for the atrocities they commit on their citizens ?!!  and it’s ludicrous to believe that the U.S will take responsibility for the military killing innocent people in other countries, they will alway say “they are the price of war”  It’s dumbfounding really………. the only way to stop the atrocities committed upon the innocent people is to kill all of the leaders responsible! there is no other way because clearly these people have no conscience and absolutely no respect for laws!

Last week, the University of California officially announced it would pay a total of nearly $1 million in settlements to the 21 UC Davis students and alumni who were pepper-sprayed during a nonviolent protest on campus last November.
Yet more important than financial retribution is the power of nonviolent student protest exemplified by those UC Davis students and graduates. This form of protest is something that current and future generations of students should understand, learn from and apply to their own lives as a way to stand up for the issues they feel passionately about.
Nonviolent tactics legitimize a protest in two ways: legally, by not challenging the monopoly on the use of force held by the state, and ideologically, by holding itself to a higher standard than rioting or other illegal tactics.
In the case of UC Davis, such tactics allowed protestors to elicit popular sympathy and support for their cause while showcasing the continuing problem of police brutality.
In the hours following the November incident, the infamous video of defenseless students taking pepper spray in the face from an armed police officer went viral on the Internet, enraging students and proponents of free speech nationwide.
A day after the incident, UC Davis students held a vigil on campus, near the site of a press conference where Chancellor Linda Katehi, who had ordered police presence at the protest, denied responsibility for the incident. As she left the conference — head bowed — hundreds of eyes fixated on Katehi, holding her accountable without saying a word.
In an era that is dominated, both at home and abroad, by violent clashes between police and civilians and protests that erupt into conflict rather than cause change, the choice of non-violent protest speaks volumes.
Those students pepper-sprayed and violently arrested at the protest were widely praised for their courage in the face of law enforcement brutality, as those at the vigil were for their demonstration of solidarity, purpose and self-control as Katehi walked by.
Though the officers who fired the pepper spray will not face any charges, a clear national consensus has been reached that the police action taken at UC Davis was wrong.
In April, a report on the incident found the UC campus police guilty of poor judgment and in violation of university policy. As part of last week’s settlement, the American Civil Liberties Union will work with UC Davis to redevelop policies on student demonstrations, crowd management and the use of force.
The pepper spray incident and its aftermath, meanwhile, will remain an indication of the maturity that students are capable of.
In the age of the Arab Spring, the Occupy Movement and student outrage over tuition hikes and budget cuts, the events at UC Davis have shown that young people can and should take on the responsibility to make peaceful change happen.

Being an office lackey isn’t as glamorous as movies would lead audiences to believe. In reality, you won’t be fetching coffee while juggling mail and miscellaneous files. You will, however, be subjected to harsh criticism of your proud work. You will have to do tasks with minimal instruction and cooperate with petty coworkers.
As USC students, we are presented with many networking opportunities. The Trojan Family has an extensive reach into nearly all career fields.
The difficulty lies in knowing what to do with these connections. Approaching potential employers for internships and other career opportunities requires subtle assertiveness. You don’t want to seem arrogant; instead, you want to show that you’re the right fit for the position by simultaneously displaying humility and confidence. This requires sufficient familiarity with the field in which you’re interested and that you conduct yourself in a direct yet positive manner.
Before accepting your position, don’t let any details surprise you. Informed queries about office logistics will show that you are actively thinking about responsibilities. If you do this, your employer will view you as an asset, rather than a clueless amateur.
It goes without saying that you should know whether your internship is paid or unpaid — kind of a major selling point — and what exactly your position entails. Though your employer is doing you a favor by giving you the chance to work, you are also offering your own services and need to make sure the position has some sort of upward mobility that will benefit you.
Additionally, it’s important to establish the amount of time you’ll be working there. Some employers have predetermined intern time periods that coincide with school semesters or seasonal quarters. Whatever the case, be sure you know where you stand. Nothing is worse than finding out from your absent-minded superior that your internship is about to end, leaving you scrambling to find your next endeavor — especially if this meeting occurs by accident when you bump into him or her as you’re making your way to the copy machine.
Interviews are tricky. If you’re lucky, you’ll feel an instant click with your interviewer and the conversation will flow freely.
Arm yourself with knowledge about the company for which you’re interviewing; the more obscure and specific the fact, the better. Casually drop in a piece of quirky company history and you’ll be golden.
“Yeah, I remember using your search engine when it was called Backrub. Ah, the good old days!” you might say during an interview with Google.
For the smoothest sailing, steer toward mutual interests while demonstrating how knowledgeable you are about the field at hand. Unfortunately, this isn’t always possible. Slip-ups do occur, so avoid touchy subjects at all costs: religion, politics and even the Chipotle-versus-Freebirds debate are off-limits.
Once you get the position — assuming you didn’t screw up the interview — the fun actually starts. Now is when you must adapt to an environment that might or might not take you seriously. Developing a close relationship with one or two mentor figures is crucial. By developing a repertoire with someone more experienced, you’ll learn the tricks of the trade and have a future resume reference and networking contact.
But you must be wary of office politics. Every working environment has its own dynamic; there are power struggles, fragile egos and entrenched traditions. You’ll have to pick up on the local customs while also not angering anyone who can influence the positive reputation you want to foster. For example, using the office kitchen is an earned privilege — don’t assume the top shelf of the fridge is all yours, because your snacks will be eaten mercilessly. On that note, bring good snacks and you’ll be a bigger hit than the kid with Lunchables on the playground.
Always remember, however, that you’re still an intern. You exist to make the jobs of those around you easier and your tasks won’t always seem important. Even a menial task, however, should be done to the best of your ability. This will show you’re dedicated to optimizing the result of any task assigned.
As for your attitude, enthusiasm and curiosity go a long way, but so does respect. Ask questions, but also know your limits. Make an effort to set aside time with your superiors to talk to them; inquire about their career path and what you can do in yours to achieve what you want. If you’re comfortable, offer to take your boss out to lunch. The personal connection and potential bonding will be appreciated and he or she will be more willing to assist you.
Being a successful intern is all about furthering your connections and learning all you can from the situation at hand. Top-quality work remains the best way to impress your employers; charm only goes so far.
It isn’t easy being at the bottom of the totem pole, but with patience and perseverance, your internship will pay off. Keep in mind your goals and constantly evaluate what your next career move will be — nobody wants an intern who is content with being an intern. Always ask for more work, seek out criticism, make mistakes and learn from them — do anything but sit around complacently.

Most musicians claim they were inspired by music from birth. And VH1 Behind the Music and E! True Hollywood Story specials seem to suggest this is true: Home videos of Justin Bieber playing the drums or Britney Spears singing in church hint at the talent that is to come.
But this trend doesn’t apply to Mat Kearney, the rock-folk artist behind hit songs like “Hey Mama,” “All I Need” and “Nothing Left to Lose.” Though Kearney dazzled audiences Friday night at the Nokia Theatre at L.A. Live, music wasn’t initially a priority for the singer-songwriter. Instead of entering talent shows in elementary school or performing in high school musicals, Kearney played competitive soccer — even attending Cal State Chico on a soccer scholarship.
“Soccer is the closest to music of all the sports,” Kearney said. “There’s creativity, and you’ve got to be unique.”
But even without any formal training, Kearney soon found himself transported from the soccer field to the music room.
“When I was in college, I would steal my roommate’s guitar,” Kearney said. “I would go outside and play a few chords and make up some songs.”
These songs were apparently good enough to warrant the attention of Kearney’s friend group.
“I made a little record and all my friends wanted it and then their friends wanted it,” Kearney said.
It wasn’t just his friends — the music industry also took notice of Kearney talents, and he can now celebrate the fact that he has released four albums and several songs that can be heard everywhere from the radio to shows like Grey’s Anatomy and One Tree Hill.
“I didn’t have a lot going on and there were just a few key moments when a song would be on a TV show and it kept my first record alive,” Kearney said. “It’s odd. You write these songs about these really emotional moments of your life and then all of a sudden there are two vampires making out to it on [The Vampire Diaries].”
Still, Kearney has managed to remain humble despite his numerous successes, a quality he attributes to his move to Nashville.
“I’ve been living in Nashville and a lot of my friends from Portland have been living here,” Kearney said. “We needed something real, a tiny bit of farmer and blue-collar truth to it, so Nashville has been an amazing place. It reminds me a lot of Portland in the sense of the kind of artists that are here. There’s a real down-to-earth, gritty quality about it.”
Even in Nashville, though, Kearney’s Oregon roots are still apparent. With a recent influx of Oregonian musicians making it big in the industry, Kearney seems to know where the talent originates.
“I played in Portland last night so it’s hard to beat the weather in the summer; there’s just a creative bug in the air,” Kearney said. “I took painting lessons [as a child] and my uncle was a potter. It just felt like art was just an intrinsic part of the culture — it’s just a creative place and once it became the [music] scene, people started showing up.”
Kearney’s geographical mix and unusual start in the industry has led to four albums with genres that are difficult to pin down.
“I would say I’ve pulled from a lot of different genres,” Kearney said. “Most singer-songwriters are super boring for me. I loved hip hop music and freestyling in my ’68 Volkswagen growing up, and I was a skater boy and that just sort of stuck with me. I always think to myself, what would Springsteen and Kanye West do together?”
The opportunity to bring his small-town sound to major cities on his current tour excites Kearney. But make no mistake. The indie artist’s performances won’t be small in any way.
“We try to treat [a show] like a good movie,” Kearney said. “It takes you on a ride of all these different emotions. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, makes you dance.”
Kearney looks to one of his idols, Bruce Springsteen, for an example of how a musician should perform.
“I’m not just sitting on a stool — there are a lot of big, epic moments in our set,” Kearney said.
Kearney also stresses that opening for a big band like Train differs from headlining one’s own show.
“When you’re opening for someone, it’s kind of like a first date,” Kearney said. “You’re bringing out your best songs and you’re hoping that you’re getting a kiss at the end of the night and the chance to go inside with them.”
Kearney often performs music from all four of his albums — a large discography for a 33-year-old musician. But even with a late start, Kearney has been able to develop his songwriting talents.
“On one level, I didn’t start writing until college and my first record was the first 12 songs I had written in life,” Kearney said. “I’m still figuring out how to do this. I feel more inspired now than I have at any point in my life.”

An animated movie with Adam Sandler voicing Dracula sounds about as irritating as it gets for anyone beyond the age of eight or for early fans of the actor’s comedy career. Hotel Transylvania\, though, manages to be a harmlessly humorous romp enhanced by director Genndy Tartakovsky’s effort to push the animation to a manic, bubblegum level.
Unusual friendship · Much to the chagrin of Count Dracula, the human Jonathan (Andy Samberg) and the young vampiress Mavis (Selena Gomez) befriend one another in Genndy Tartakovsky’s Hotel Transylvania. – | Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures
In the film, Count Dracula, in an effort to protect his daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) from the outside world, creates Hotel Transylvania so that monsters can relax in a sanctuary from the human world that they believe still fears and despises them. These creatures include Frankenstein’s Monster (Kevin James), the Wolfman, Wayne (Steve Buscemi) and the Mummy (CeeLo Green).
Many of these characters are back at the hotel for Mavis’ 118th birthday; the “young” vampiress yearns to explore the outside world, even though her father believes that human civilization would only destroy her. Yet in the aftermath of Dracula’s elaborate ruse, a human named Jonathan (Andy Samberg) ends up at the hotel, threatening the safety of the monsters and the reputation of the hotel. The plot, of course, thickens when Jonathan and Mavis begin to form a mutual attraction to one another.
If the film carries a glaring fault, it’s that this kind of father-daughter relationship has been explored again and again in other films, particularly animated ones. And thus, the film becomes predictable; if you’ve seen The Little Mermaid or Finding Nemo (with a similarly protective father-son relationship), you’ll have a very good idea of where this story is going the moment Mavis and Jonathan lay eyes on each other.
But outside  the film’s hackneyed plot, Hotel Transylvania moves along briskly.
The voice actors do a fairly good job; Sandler isn’t nearly as annoying as you would expect, and there are moments where he gives the vampiric lord an air of grace and understanding. Still, most of the other voice actors have been featured in his other films, so Hotel Transylvania feels like the cast of a typical Adam Sandler comedy — just with legendary horror creatures. The familiar cast gives off a strange feeling of déjà vu, but it makes the friendship between the characters seem all the more legitimate.
The look and feel of the film boasts the style of the director, Genndy Tartakovsky. Tartakovsky, the creator of Dexter’s Laboratory and Samurai Jack, was the sixth director brought onto the project, which Sony Pictures Animation has struggled with since 2006. The studio allowed Tartakovsky to rewrite the script and push and exaggerate the 3-D animation. The film’s visual style now resembles classic Tex Avery cartoons rather than the realistic images of Pixar.
Though the style doesn’t differ much from the plastic look of Sony Animation’s previous film, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, it definitely keeps the spirit of the simplified approach Tartakovsky is known for. The facial expressions are almost spot-on character takes from Dexter’s Laboratory, and considering Tartakovsky hasn’t done too many projects recently, it’s nice to see him back in the spotlight.
But when the film kicks into high gear, the elasticity and squash-and-stretch technique used for the characters really push the limits of animation techniques. Hotel Transylvania’s form of exaggeration and experimentation is refreshing to see in a major animated feature — especially since recent films have focused too much on how good the graphics look as opposed to what advancements they can contribute to the animation industry.
It must be said, however, that if you really aren’t familiar with Tartakovsky or don’t pay attention to animation styles, this film might be a bit too thin. Hotel Transylvania remains enjoyable on its own terms, but it caters more to children than adults who appreciate more sly, sophiscated comedy.
Hotel Transylvania’s hyperactive humor often covers very familiar ground.  The film itself makes commentary in the third act on how these horror legends have become so familiar to the public that the monsters resemble celebrities more than creatures worth fearing.  And Hotel Transylvania does manage to avoid relying too much on pop culture references, except for one blatant — yet still very funny — throwaway gag about the Twilight franchise.
But animation buffs and the young-at-heart should definitely check out Hotel Transylvania. And if the film proves successful, it’ll be great to see what Tartakovsky will do next in animation.
Would a Samurai Jack movie be too much to ask for?
