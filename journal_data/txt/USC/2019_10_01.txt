So far, this column has mainly focused on professional esports and how pursuing esports as a career should not be stigmatized — but pro players are just one part of the sport.
The other prominent aspect of gaming is the streamers: people who commentate while they play video games live for thousands to watch. These people dedicate much of their lives to streaming themselves playing video games for several hours a day. The top streamers receive endorsements and donations as well as money from viewers who pay for premium content.
Some of the most famous streamers have built their followings on streaming platforms because of their professional careers, but the vast majority of streamers are just normal people — many of whom aren’t even that good at the game they play.  
But why would anyone want to watch random people play video games, especially if they’re not very good to begin with? The answer is the sense of community it provides. 
Streamers have developed a community with their audiences. Thousands of viewers with similar interests are simultaneously watching and chatting with each other. These massive fan bases have chat rooms dedicated solely to discussing video games and streamers.
It’s like getting together with your buddies to watch a football game. You all get in a room, chat about what you’re watching and crack jokes with each other. It’s the same concept for streamers, but instead of 10 friends in a living room, it’s 10,000 “friends” on a streaming platform.
Video games are often seen as a niche community. I’ve experienced this firsthand. People are afraid to express their interest in gaming, fearing judgment because of the stigma games can carry. 
My first column at the Daily Trojan was about esports. I still remember the look on our former editor-in-chief’s face when I, the sports editor she just hired, told her that video games count as sports. For a while after that, I suppressed my passion for video games, watching streamers in privacy in the Daily Trojan sports office. (For the record, she later let me cover a big esports event.)
Streamers alleviate the fear of this prejudice by providing a safe space for people who love video games. Most streamers are normal people. They are relatable to viewers who are searching for a place to fit in.
At any given moment, I can log on to Twitch or YouTube Gaming and find someone playing the games I love. There will be hundreds or thousands of other people watching the same game at the same time.
It’s reassuring to know that other people share your interests and that at any point of the day you can “hang out” — albeit virtually — with those people. It’s nice to know that you aren’t a weird outcast whose passion is always stigmatized.
The reality is that esports, as a part of society, are becoming more similar to traditional sports. Some of the most passionate football fans have never played a day of organized football, but that doesn’t stop them from watching every Sunday, playing fantasy football and discussing the game with their friends.
The bottom line is that the esports community should not be afraid to show its pride for video games. Streamers have laid the framework to help integrate the community into the mainstream. 
With just about every aspect of media moving toward the digital space, it’s incredibly important to understand the influence that individual “normal people” can have on an entire community.

USC’s offensive coordinator Graham Harrell threw for 15,793 yards and 134 touchdowns during his time at Texas Tech University — the fourth and third most in NCAA history, respectively. 
Now, he hopes to impart the spread scheme that helped him achieve video game numbers onto a Trojan offense that was devoid of life last year.
Harrell previously worked under Mike Leach, his college coach, as the outside receivers’ coach at Washington State, where Leach’s spread offense has often boasted the leading passer in the nation despite underwhelming recruiting. Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Gardner Minshew II, who has taken the NFL by storm with his famous mustache and atypical background after being a three-star product out of high school, threw 4,779 yards and 38 touchdowns for the Cougars in his final college season. Redshirt senior Anthony Gordon, WSU’s current starting quarterback, is averaging over 400 yards passing per game — further proof of the scheme’s effectiveness. 
Texas Tech has employed the spread offense to great offensive success. When last year’s NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes played at TTU, he had over 5,000 yards in a season and an outrageous 734 yards passing in one game. 
While Art Briles has had a career mired with scandal, his scheme turned a Baylor team that consistently finished at the bottom of the Big 12 standings into a perennial contender. Briles’ Air Raid was so effective that in 2015, after two quarterbacks went down with injuries, a third-stringer led the Bears through four games to a bowl win against No. 10 UNC. 
In summation, the Air Raid works very, very well.
While USC head coach Clay Helton rejects the notion that USC uses a true Air Raid, the offense has looked like one through its first five games. Even though their top two quarterbacks on the depth chart are injured, the Trojans are not calling the season — primarily because of their faith in the scheme. 
The Air Raid offense, as the name suggests, maintains a commitment to the air attack by passing the ball frequently. Mike Leach’s WSU offense has been known to pass the ball around 50 times per game. While USC is only averaging about 35 pass attempts per game, many of the core concepts remain the same. 
To move the chains and create manageable second and third downs, the traditional Air Raid elects to throw short, often to the running back, rather than run the ball. Compared to sophomore quarterback JT Daniels’ numerous end zone heaves that seemed to be the focus of USC’s offense last season, Trojan quarterbacks have been more surgical this year, completing short passes at an incredible 72.3% clip between Daniels, freshman Kedon Slovis and redshirt junior Matt Fink. Though Harrell has elected to not completely cut out the run, giving redshirt junior tailback Vavae Malepeai around 15 carries per game, the offense looks primarily to move the ball by passing rather than running. 
The Air Raid offense maintains a fast tempo and stresses getting in and out of the huddle quickly. The Trojans have been consistent with this tenet, churning through plays quickly and keeping defenses tired. 
The offensive scheme is intentionally simple; there aren’t many plays, and it’s designed to let players play loose. In his introductory press conference, Harrell said just that about his offense. 
“You’re not going to sit there and try to out-scheme people,” he said. “It’s an identity. It gives you an identity and says, ‘This is who we are, and we’re going to be good at what we do.’” 
Pre-snap, the quarterback reads the defense and determines which matchups are favorable given the formations. Then he snaps the ball and pulls the trigger. It’s that simple.
The X’s and O’s of the Air Raid offense are simple: pass a lot, play fast, identify good matchups and execute. The spread offense has been keeping the Trojans competitive with a third string quarterback, and with Harrell calling the shots, the ceiling is high for USC’s offense.

No. 5 USC women’s soccer travels east later this week to take on Arizona State and Arizona as it looks to bounce back from a 3-2 loss to Stanford in the Pac-12 opener. 
USC’s last three games have been tough to watch for Trojan fans. After its disappointing loss to the No. 2 Cardinal, the Trojans are looking to get their mojo back.
After taking a couple of days to digest the game against Stanford, head coach Keidane McAlpine said USC had chances down the stretch to tie things up but failed to capitalize on several second half opportunities.
“We just have to execute better,” McAlpine said. “I didn’t think we executed what we had worked on in the week very well, and even with that, we were in the game and had moments where we should have tied the game up.” 
McAlpine mentioned the importance of learning from the Stanford loss yet shifting focus to this weekend as the Trojans play their first Pac-12 road contests in the desert.  
“The good thing for us is our goal strictly is to get better week to week,” he said. “So sometimes, you actually learn more in losses and ties than you do in wins. So we’ve had two weeks where we can legitimately take some information from both games to provide us with more understanding of who we are [and] where we are right now moving into Arizona State and Arizona.” 
The Trojans will face a strong Arizona State team Thursday. McAlpine identified his attackers as an advantage for the Trojans against a 6-2-2 Sun Devil squad. 
“Our advantage will always be with our two-front,” he said of junior forward Tara McKeown and sophomore forward Penelope Hocking. “They are scoring goals with regularity. That for us is definitely a plus against anyone.”
McAlpine emphasized the need to stop Sun Devils sophomore forward/midfielder Marleen Schimmer and to win the possession battle against ASU. 
“For us, we’ve gotta deal with their 27 [Schimmer],” he said. “She strikes the ball way better than most players out there. They are a very good possession team, very much like Stanford. We’re going to have to weather the storm when they have the ball and be patient in our defending.”
The Sun Devils are coming off a 2-2 tie with Utah, who are currently ranked ahead of ASU by 56 spots in the NCAA RPI poll. It was an encouraging start to the conference schedule for ASU. On the other hand, Arizona opened up its league play with a 2-1 loss to Colorado in a double overtime contest. 
Not only will the Trojans be challenged by two good squads in Arizona, but they will also have to face the heat. Temperatures are expected to be in the 90s for both kickoff times as of now, and the Trojans will have to be mentally and physically prepared to endure the conditions. 
When asked about the upcoming matchups, McAlpine said one of the games would be more difficult to handle than the other. 
“[With] the Arizona State game being at night, I think that will help us,” McAlpine said. “It will be similar to the Baylor game, so we’ve experienced it. The noon kick in Arizona is probably going to be the hardest one already coming off a game.”
With the Trojans in the loss column to open up Pac-12 play, McAlpine said it’s important to pick up two wins in Arizona and get the Trojans back to their winning ways. 
“Every game is important in this stretch for our long term goals, for our short term goals,” he said. “You are always looking for a split on the road at the very least, but for us now being down one … trying to get back toward the top, it would be very beneficial to get both.”
The Trojans face Arizona State Thursday at 7 p.m. before taking on Arizona Sunday at 1 p.m.

Xavier Hernandez has always been passionate about science, technology, engineering and mathematics education. As a graduate student in the Iovine and Young Academy, he wanted to create new and innovative ways to empower other Latinx students pursuing STEM fields.
Hernandez, who completed his undergraduate degree in the Viterbi School of Engineering, founded a STEM education company in January 2017 after realizing the ways in which he can help students and entrepreneurs develop STEM ideas and leadership. STEM and Create empowers individuals and organizations through networks that allow individuals to share their own experiences by writing community blog posts, attending speaker events and purchasing merchandise that contributes to STEM scholarships. 
After launching his company, he knew he wanted to return to USC when he  heard about IYA during his junior year and said he knew he wanted to join the school post-graduation. 
“I had always been really interested in getting a cross-disciplinary degree that could use different sides of my mind … different skill sets that I have,” Hernandez said. “I want to be creative but still use my technological background. [I wanted to do] something great for my culture, my people and for my community.”  
Hernandez said his Latinx background motivated him to launch STEM and Create before attending the academy. Through his company, he hosts public speaking workshops for students and parents that focus on diversity in the field. 
“I’ve done a lot of work trying to help excite people to get into the STEM field, and also helping people on how to succeed,” Hernandez said.
Cassandra Flores-Montano, a doctoral candidate in the American studies and ethnicities program, met Hernandez in the Latinx Graduate Student Association and works with him in Graduate Student Government.
“He’s always willing to go the extra mile for the things that he is passionate about,” Flores-Montano said. “Even though he is not an executive board member of the Latino Graduate Student Association this year, he has still been super involved with them in supporting their programming, trying to collaborate with them through his role with GSG and just helping promote their events as if he were a board member.”
Hernandez said his goal is to be a role model for Latinx college students as well as students who come from rural communities who hope to enter into STEM majors. According to the American Society for Engineering Education, Latinx students only held 10% of all engineering degrees in 2015. 
“I come from a Latinx background and I grew up on a farm, so I know that there’s a lot of kids that come from my background who have struggled to step into this field because they’ve never seen someone from their background, their family [or] from [anyone in] their network,” Hernandez said. “[After] starting STEM and Create, I not only see myself as a creative and engineer but as some kind of educator that looks like [them], talks like [them] and comes from a similar background and socioeconomic status.”
Hernandez said his journey to USC was challenging because it was hard leaving his hometown in Woodlake, a small town in central California. He said he was the first in his family to leave the farm.
“When I left, I knew I had one super large goal in mind which was to make an impact on my people from my community and the world in general,” Hernandez said. “I want to make the world a better place. I know it sounds cheesy, but when I grew up,  my parents made our world a better place for us even though they didn’t have all the money in the world, all the job titles, all the cool success … They did everything they could to make us really happy and empowered to do anything we set our mind to.”
Samuel Garza, a doctoral candidate in the molecular pharmacology and toxicology program, said Hernandez’ work is inspirational. Garza met Hernandez through GSG and said he brought people together and lead projects..
“He makes you want to do more and be more involved and makes you feel like you want can make a difference,” Garza said. “He is determined, in the way that he has such strong determination and clearly gets things done.”

Senator Haley Garland requested funding for the purchase of pro-consent reusable cups in order to curb sexual assault on game days during the Undergraduate Student Government meeting Tuesday. 
Garland’s proposal referenced a study that found football games increased the rate of reported sexual assaults by 41% on home game days for victims ages 17 to 24. According to the study, this increase is due to heightened alcohol consumption at tailgates. 
Garland was inspired by the study and proposed the project, which would allow for the purchase of 800 reusable cups with consent friendly slogans such as “consent is sexy” to be distributed at tailgates on game days. She considers this as a small step toward getting students to think about consent.
“I thought maybe a small way to kind of institute or to make people think about sexual assault about consent, during game days reserves, and increase of alcohol is putting a pro-consent statement on the cups,” Garland said. “Something essentially that would bring people back to being respectable human beings.” 
Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services also created solo cups with pro-consent sayings last year, but were unable to distribute them to students due to restrictions related to USC departments handing out materials used for alcohol consumption.
USG President Trenton Stone supports the project as an important way to educate students.
“We have things like bystander training, we have consent workshops, all the work that RSVP does with the group called ‘VOICE’ and things like that,” Stone said. “But a lot of those are separate and housed in, the health center, and a lot of students don’t actively seek that out.”
Stone also believes that distributing the pro-consent cups will help involve students in discussions concerning sexual assault.
“I think it’s a great way to basically start a grassroots movement around consent and around healthy relationships,” Stone said. 
Sen. Ben Rosenthal raised concerns during the meeting as to how to equally distribute the cups to tailgates on game days. Garland said the cups would be equally divided among fraternity tailgates. 
Sen. Omar Garcia also questioned the effectiveness of the project. 
“How would we measure success?” Garcia asked.
Garland said the cups is a small part of a larger conversation about sexual assault on campus. She also acknowledged the sustainability issue and decided on reusable cups. She is also open to biodegradable paper cups.
Voting to approve funding on the project will occur at next Tuesday’s USG meeting.

Nobody ever thought this generation would become addicted to nicotine, let alone from a device that looks like a USB drive. But it happened, and we must put an end to the mass usage of Juuls among college-aged people. 
USC is a smoke-free campus. The policy handbook clearly states that smoking is not permitted at any facility — indoor or outdoor — owned and leased by the University.
Smoking a cigarette on campus? Probably not going to end well for you. Hitting a big, clunky vape in the dining hall? Yikes. Smoking a joint in your dorm? You’re in trouble. But when it comes to Juuling — that’s a form of smoking you can realistically get away with. 
Juul is an electronic cigarette that was launched in 2015. It uses a battery-powered coil to turn a liquid solution into an aerosol inhaled by the user. The liquid is stored in a disposable Juulpod attached to the device, which is also produced by Juul Labs. All pods are either 3% or 5% nicotine by weight and are flavored — options include mango, mint and classic tobacco. They come in a sleek, all-black design similar to USB drives and produce a rather inconspicuous, odorless wisp of smoke that disperses quickly. 
The creators of Juul, both Stanford University graduates, allegedly created the device to help smokers quit — the goal was to eliminate traditional cigarettes. However, a USC study found that e-cigarette usage does not meaningfully change among people aged 25-44, but decreased in people ages 45 and older. By contrast, teenage vaping has doubled since 2017, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Instead of getting adults off of cigarettes and onto Juuls, the company is taking kids’ prior nicotine abstinence and making them addicts early on.
The CDC posits that Juuls are popular because they are discrete, contain a lot of nicotine and come in appealing, candy-like flavors. In December 2018, Surgeon General Jerome Adams issued a notice on kids’ e-cigarette use, calling the growing issue an epidemic. 
Though Juuls provide cigarettes’ nicotine fix without the carcinogens, that does not mean Juuls are necessarily consequence-free. Nicotine is detrimental for developing brains because it can disrupt the formation of circuits that control attention and learning. Furthermore, a joint study by Duke and Yale universities found that “when certain popular flavors are added to a common solvent in the vaping liquids, they produce chemicals that irritate airways and lungs.” A different study  from the American College of Cardiology even tied e-cigarette use with heart and artery disease. 
The government is catching on to how big this problem is. The Food and Drug Administration is going to outline a plan to remove flavored e-cigarettes and pods from the market. Michigan has become the first state to prohibit the sales of flavored e-cigarettes, with California considering similar policy. Moreover, the Trump administration itself desires to ban flavored e-cigarettes. 
In response to outrage, Juul Labs has announced plans to limit the sale of its fruity pods exclusively to its website, prevent online bulk purchases, strengthen its online age verification system and crack down on unauthorized online sales. While commendable, it’s a little too late. It has already created a generation of addicts. 
The sad fact is that quitting Juuling is difficult. As brought up in the subreddit dedicated to Juul, some consider it far more difficult to quit than cigarettes because Juuls are more pervasive. Because you can Juul practically all the time and in any setting, Juuling is harder to kick than cigarettes, which cannot be smoked wherever or whenever. The reason it is so easy to start is exactly why it is so hard to stop: Quitting is so difficult. 
Because Juuls are so new, the extent of their long-term impact is not yet known. Nonetheless, findings are already quite grim. The best thing to do is to not smoke at all. If you’ve started, stop. If you never have, don’t. Inhaling foreign substances is generally not a good idea. Perhaps this is more of an incentive to stop: Getting busted on USC’s smoke-free campus for Juuling would be horrifically embarrassing.

Who can beat Donald Trump? The question has recurred throughout the past three Democratic debates. Likewise, much of the post-debate discussion has centered on which candidate has enough fight to take on Trump in a “head-to-head matchup,” as one CNN poll put it. The candidates, boasting their ability to beat Trump handily, come off more as athletes engaging in pre-game smack talk. The language, and the attitudes they convey, are often more reminiscent of a boxing match than of a political election.
And why shouldn’t the candidates speak this way? Elections are much like a game: Their goal is to win control of the House, the Senate and the White House. If your team, red or blue, can collect all three at once, then you win the game — or at least the round. This mentality is by no means new, but the current election cycle has brought it to the foreground. Democrats want to send their strongest player to bat against Trump, the candidate who can best represent their team and, to a lesser extent, its policies. 
The obvious problem with this sports-like attitude is that it detracts from the important issues. It seems that more analysis is dedicated to the candidates’ ability to win the presidency than their suitability to hold it. Instead of focusing our attention on what the candidates might accomplish with the position, we are determining whether or not they can win it.
Even the word “winning,” as commonplace as it is in political discussions, has deeper social implications. A poll taken by the Cooperative Congressional Election Study found that 41% of people with strong partisan leanings said that winning an election is more important than seeing their preferred policies put into place. This means that a large portion of voters from either side only cast their ballot to beat the opposing team. 
For many, winning has become an end in itself. Policies and ideas become secondary; all that matters is that the other team doesn’t get to see their own put in place. With this mindset, voting for the opposing candidate becomes voting for the enemy team. This leaves us with party lines that are rarely crossed, over which productive discussion becomes increasingly impossible. 
To the party’s biggest fans, the means of scoring a win are unimportant. The same study that measured their prioritization of winning also found that partisans of both sides give their team a concerning amount of leeway when it comes to securing that victory. In fact, 38% of partisans said they would authorize their party leaders to use “any means necessary” to win elections. The list includes voter suppression, lying and even physical violence against the other party — it’s all in the game. 
We see the issue laid bare with the most recent development in Trump’s impeachment process. According to an unnamed whistleblower’s report, the president withheld $400 million in aid to Ukraine in an attempt to extort them into investigating his Democratic rival Joe Biden. It was a clear abuse of power and an impeachment-worthy offense, but despite the 223 House Democrats who have supported an impeachment inquiry, not a single Republican has joined their ranks. Their side will continue to “win” as long as Trump remains in office. The terms of that win are immaterial.   
The growing possibility of impeachment has also made evident the dangers of treating politics as a sport. Trump tweeted out that his removal from office would cause a “Civil War Like fracture,” and a few Republicans have followed his rhetoric. Iowa Republican Representative Steve King shared an image referencing a civil war between red and blue states. One side, the image jokes, has “about 8 trillion bullets.” This attitude conveys that violence and division are preferable to losing, when losing is not an option. 
Unfortunately, the treatment of politics as a sport will likely persist as long as there are party affiliations. It will exist because people care about their politics, and that is not a bad thing in and of itself. It’s when that care turns into fandom and when winning overshadows policy, that it becomes a losing game for everyone.

At USC, students boast the opportunity to learn from working professionals in their field of study. This is no exception at the School of Dramatic Arts, where Scott Faris, director of the school’s upcoming play “The Cider House Rules,” teaches.
Faris, a Southern California native, began his career as an actor before transitioning into directing. He attended a performing arts university in San Diego where he appeared in several productions. He eventually earned his equity card and moved to New York City after graduation. Although he arrived in what he called the “big leagues,” he said he still wanted to do more. 
“I looked around the room in rehearsal and while we were on tour and said, ‘Who’s in charge here?’” Faris said. “And  I realized that it was the production stage manager.” 
This realization prompted Faris to dive deeper into the world of stage managing, and eventually, directing.
“I followed that path and never looked back,” Farris said.
In addition to his work on Broadway, Faris has assisted with several spectacle shows, most notably Cirque Du Soleil, to bring in aspects of acting and marry the two worlds together. 
Today, Faris is an assistant professor of theater practice in stage management and director for SDA’s upcoming production, “The Cider House Rules.” The show is performed in two parts over the course of two different nights, spanning decades of the characters’ lives. The cast will perform in both parts of the play, which allows for not only consistency in the narrative, but also growth and exposure to new techniques of acting. 
“I think it is a tremendous opportunity for actors to be able to play characters that mature in front of the audience’s eyes,” Faris said. “There are challenges that go with that, but I think it’s a great opportunity to explore how you would do that.”
Directing a play of this size is challenging, but Faris remains optimistic. 
“You can’t start every rehearsal with ‘This is a huge show. I hope you make it,’” Faris said. “You say, ‘Good, let’s start here. And let’s just do this and only think about that.’ And when we feel good about that then we will move onto the next step. So it therefore doesn’t become this daunting mountain to climb, but it really becomes a  path that you are looking for each step-creating stone along the way.” 
Faris has seen differences between directing in professional and university settings. To him, the more experiences he confronts, whether that be working for a professional group or a school, the more he learns. One of the differences, he said, is that SDA students possess the same passion and enthusiasm as working professionals, but don’t have the same connections. Faris said he strives to be their guide into the professional theater world.
“It’s fantastic to be able to try to share with [the students] the way I work,” Faris said. “Not so much the expectations of professional theater, but the methods and the goals. I’m very much aware of guiding them as a learning experience at the same time as directing this show.” 
Additionally, it is a challenge to compete with other shows that are put up at the same time. But Faris uses that as a way to really explore the actors he is auditioning. 
“It intensified how I explored the skills of each actor that came in front of me,” Faris said. “I wanted to make sure I’d explored each person as fully as possible, make sure I wasn’t, that I wouldn’t underestimate or miss some quality they had. You feel that pressure making sure that you don’t let anyone get away that you want.” 
When asked what the main takeaway from the show should be, Faris said he is not there to tell the audience how to feel about this work but rather to present the story and provide a platform for student artists to collaborate and grow. 
“My responsibility is to present the play as clearly and fully as I can so that everyone can draw their own conclusion when they walk out,” Faris said. “I’m not there to tell them that, I’m there to present.”
“The Cider House Rules, Part One: Here in St. Clouds” opens Oct. 31 and “The Cider House Rules, Part Two: In Other Parts of This World” opens Nov. 1 in the Bing Theatre.

The walls of Marisol de la Garza’s room were covered with colorful tapestries. De la Garza, a junior majoring in art and cognitive science, put some final strokes of purple on a large portrait of a Puerto Rican deity. Something on the table felt slightly out of place in the apartment.
It was a dead beetle. 
“As an artist, I try to pick up shiny and fluorescent bugs … which are always poisonous,” de la Garza explained with a laugh. 
The beetle was a stunning shade of green that sparkled as it caught the light. It was strikingly beautiful. It is now a part of her exhibition titled “Colorín Colorado, este cuento no se ha acabado,” which will be on display at the Helen Lindhurst Fine Arts Gallery in Watt Hall. The show will run from Oct. 1 to 10, with a reception Oct. 3. 
Beetles aside, de la Garza’s exhibition centers on her experience as a stateside Puerto Rican. Its main tenants are giant portraits of figures from Taino-Puerto Rican folklore. These deities are surrounded by vibrant indigenous animals, including leatherback turtles and iguanas. 
“Fables were definitely a way that I’ve always connected,” de la Garza said. “My first impressions of Puerto Rico were these things my parents would talk about.”
De la Garza was born in Los Angeles and raised in San Antonio. Her grandparents are natives to Puerto Rico and help her maintain close ties to the island. Her family still has a small farm there. 
Speaking on the effects of Hurricane Maria, de la Garza recounted how the devastating hurricane inspired her show and catalyzed her artistic process. She emphasized ecology and the environment as important themes in her work: Many of her pieces feature endangered species and highlight a message on the topic of conservation. 
“Part of the discussion with colonialism [in Puerto Rico] is because industry really sacrifices the ecology,” de la Garza said. “And so that’s always something I’ve been sad about because they have such biodiversity there, and it’s just dwindling.” 
With “Colorín Colorado,” de la Garza’s main goal is to spread awareness about the issues Puerto Rico faces, including climate change, poverty and the effects of colonialism. De la Garza said some of her inspiration comes from revolutionary colonial theorist Frantz Fanon. 
“I wanted to bring all of those things that aren’t conveyed in the media at least to this institution,” de la Garza said. “Just bringing this into a gallery setting would be an accomplishment for me.” 
De la Garza started out as a muralist. She stressed the sociopolitical aspects of murals and the importance of their accessibility. Remembering her work with murals and restoration, de la Garza emphasized that constructing and preserving murals is a highly collaborative effort. According to the Texas native, graffiti artists and local high schoolers would work with artists like herself to paint murals that would beautify neighborhoods and push back against gentrification. 
De la Garza expressed gratitude for the opportunities made available to her at the Roski School of Art and Design. She said studying art in an academic setting has helped her refine her talents, giving her the tools to transition from a mural background to a more holistic artistic skill set. Most importantly, Roski has helped de la Garza’s work grow conceptually. 
“I really wanted to be able to have, not an authority over art, but at least a voice in it … You have to be accredited and I wanted to learn the dialect and the writing skills that artists have  to have,” de la Garza said. “Transitioning from a mural background to [a university setting] is not an opportunity many people get.”
Aside from the resources within Roski, de la Garza credits her roommate Erin Garcia with helping her work develop. Garcia, a junior majoring in fine art, serves as a sort of soundboard for de la Garza’s early concepts. When asked about what she looks forward to seeing in the exhibition, Garcia focused on the audience’s response.
“Not a lot of people have encountered this content before,” Garcia said. “I am excited to see how people will interact with it, if they’ll know what to do or what to think.”
Looking to the future, de la Garza wants to work at the intersection of arts and science, particularly in the field of animal behavior. But for now, she is happy with the opportunity this exhibition has presented to commemorate her Puerto Rican roots and bring her culture into the mainstream consciousness. 
“I definitely just want people to raise awareness and show more concern,” de la Garza said. “That’s how I think this is trying to impact people psychologically.”

The Department of Public Safety’s annual security and fire safety report released Tuesday indicates increased reports of rape and fondling on the University Park Campus in 2018 due to incidents of sexual assault under former campus gynecologist George Tyndall. While the report does not include the over 800 assault-related allegations against Tyndall, it sees an increase in sex offenses, robbery, aggravated assault, acts of violence against women and drug violations.
DPS reported 118 sex offenses on campus and in the surrounding community, marking an increase from 34 reports in 2017 and 40 in 2016. 
In a letter to the USC community, Senior Vice President for Administration David Wright wrote this year’s security report includes reports related to Tyndall, who worked at the University for nearly 30 years until his removal in 2016. This report comes three months after the Los Angeles Police Department arrested and charged Tyndall with 29 felony counts, including sexual penetration of an unconscious person and sexual battery by fraud. In early September, Tyndall surrendered his medical license.
According to the report, there were 68 reports of rape and four reports of fondling related to Tyndall. Unrelated to the former gynecologist, there were an additional 24 reports of rape and 21 reports of fondling.
“In keeping with guidance from the Department of Education, the University has sought to classify and account for all Tyndall-related conduct reported to designated campus officials in 2018 in the annual statistics,” the letter read. 
Wright’s letter elaborates on the reports against Tyndall, explaining that not all allegations received by the University are considered under the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, a federal law that requires colleges to disclose this information. 
Stacy Giwa, vice president of ethics and compliance, said interactions within a clinical setting may not fit the Clery definitions of rape of fondling. Additionally, she said the Clery Act ensures that universities maintain accurate reporting and that institutions can be penalized for overreporting or underreporting incidents. 
“In the context of the clinical setting, there is some level of touching or other medical procedure that would be taking place,” Giwa said. “The guidance we got from the Department of Education, their Clery office, is that we needed to look at the concerns on-face to see if they met [Clery Act] elements.”
Giwa said that though the Department of Education maintains an open dialogue with universities producing safety and security reports, the unusual number of sex crimes and the fact that these reports are from the past 26 years initiated more guiding conversations with USC.
“We really wanted to get this right so we did reach out and engage with the Department of Education,” Giwa said. “And especially given the complexity of this taking place in a medical setting … we did additional outreach so that we could meet our obligations under Clery and also provide accurate information to our community.”
According to the letter, USC will continue to review any additional information it receives regarding reports of misconduct in the Tyndall case and will revise the 2018 statistics as needed. And with the revelations regarding Tyndall’s behavior, the University has taken steps to try to increase student safety and well-being as well as reform the Engemann Student Health Center such as by adding more female gynecologists, hiring a new medical center director and placing the center under the oversight of the Keck School of Medicine.
“This information has been shared with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights,” the letter read. “The University also is aware of 811 current and former students who filed lawsuits in state and federal court and have asserted they were harmed by Tyndall.”
The University expects the statistics for reports of sexual assault and misconduct received in 2018 to increase in the coming year.
“To me, every individual experience reflected in this report is distressing. But seeing the aggregate numbers for Tyndall — involving reports over a period of 27 years — is especially distressing to all of us,” President Carol Folt wrote in the report. “For me and my entire administration, the stark numbers reinforce our resolve to remain vigilant about safety, to continue to provide care and resources, and to take measures to enhance safety and well-being on all of our campuses.”
While instances of robbery and aggravated assault increased in 2018 in comparison to years prior, instances of burglary and motor vehicle theft have decreased. The annual report also indicates that disciplinary referrals related to drug violations have nearly doubled on campus. 
“We added nearly 3,000 student beds in the [USC] Village and more students on campus,” Assistant Chief David Carlisle said. “We work very closely with Residential Education to talk about the education of the students, but also accurate reporting when there are violations of student conduct. And we are thinking the additional education with [resident assistants] … has contributed to increased numbers.”
Regarding an increase in robberies, Carlisle said DPS had caught a group of juveniles on campus robbing community members of their property. Carlisle said all students should be cautious when walking late at night with their phones out. In response to these incidents, DPS established a Crime Reduction Unit to work with LAPD and local transit officers to tackle robbery on and near campus.
In addition to publishing crime and safety statistics at the University and its many satellite locations, the report outlines University and DPS resources, such as the Office of Threat Assessment and Management, crime prevention programs and DPS procedures regarding monitoring crimes.  
“The University of Southern California is committed to keeping all of us out of harm’s way,” Folt wrote. “This report outlines the many actions the University, our dedicated public safety team, and our campus partners take every day to keep our community safe. We live in an urban center, and each of us needs to take personal safety seriously and also do all that we can to keep others around us safe.”
According to the report, though DPS has not identified any immediate needs for future improvements to campus security programs and efforts, it will continue to improve upon existing programs and technology. 
“One of [President Folt’s] highest priorities is ensuring that every student, faculty and staff feels safe and confident in their experience, and also stressing the commitment to being accurate and open,” Giwa said.

Ah, the NCAA. Rarely does high praise follow any mention of this adored organization. Still, I would like to give credit where it’s due by applauding its awesome, if obvious, decision to do away with the Bowl Championship Series in favor of a College Football Playoff in 2014. 
I don’t know if you remember life before this landmark decision, but it was a dark time for college football fans. Only two teams had the chance to play for a national championship, and those two teams were determined by the BCS, a confusing formula that even most college football analysts couldn’t explain. Oh, it was terrible. Three teams could go undefeated, but only two would have the chance to play for the championship game. Or worse, in 2007 two teams went undefeated, but a one-loss “power conference” team was chosen to play for a national championship over my beloved 2007 Hawaii Warriors? But I digress. 
Fans had pushed for a four-team playoff for ages, and it was an instant success in its first year. The Ohio State Buckeyes, equipped with a third-string quarterback and future NFL star running back Ezekiel Elliott, snuck in as the fourth seed with a matchup against the No. 1-seeded Alabama Crimson Tide. Elliott ran all over Alabama head coach Nick Saban’s defense — in New Orleans of all places — and the Buckeyes upset the Tide for a chance to play Oregon in the national championship.
The season ended with Ohio State cornerback Eli Apple picking off Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota in the closing seconds. It was clear that the College Football Playoff was justified in its inaugural year, as it provided a talented team which would not have been able to contend for the BCS an opportunity to win it all.
Since then, we’ve had a fair mix of sleepy and enthralling playoff performances. Alabama and Clemson are the meat and potatoes, while Lincoln Riley’s high-powered Oklahoma offenses spice things up. There’s usually one team that doesn’t seem to belong and one or two teams that should have gone in its place. 
But you know what’s better than a four-team playoff? I’ll tell you — an eight-team playoff. Yeah, I know — thanks, Captain Obvious. But I’m serious. College football needs an eight-team playoff. It’s not a controversial statement. In fact, it’s a sentiment shared by fans and analysts alike since the first round of playoff games. We can’t get enough of them. 
However, there’s a much better reason to double the playoff field than simply entertainment. We’re still less than halfway through the college football season, but I can count about 10 teams off the top of my head that all deserve a shot at a playoff spot: Alabama, Ohio State, Georgia, Clemson, Oklahoma, LSU, Auburn, Wisconsin, Notre Dame and Florida. Throw in a Texas, Penn State or Oregon team that runs the table, and you’ve got a real traffic jam of good football. 
Now, many of these teams will play each other at some point this season and thin the herd — some already have — but all of these teams look dominant right now. We already have a glimpse of a dream scenario in which recent transfers Ohio State sophomore quarterback Justin Fields and Oklahoma senior quarterback Jalen Hurts could seek revenge against their former teams in the playoffs (Fields transferred from Georgia, Hurts from Alabama). 
But I’ll be damned if I don’t get a chance to see LSU senior quarterback Joe Burrow do the same to Ohio State, the school he transferred from in 2018. How will we determine the playoff contenders if Notre Dame runs the table with only one loss in a tight game to Georgia? Or with this bloodless SEC West, which includes games between Alabama, Auburn and LSU, only one of which will have the chance to compete for an SEC championship? And see, just like that, I forgot about the behemoth that is our defending national champions: coach Dabo Swinney and the Clemson Tigers.
Point is, these teams are too good to leave out of championship contention. Who cares if they eat each other once or twice in the regular season? Isn’t that what the playoff is for? And don’t give me the old talking point about more strain on their bodies from the extra round of games. These guys grind out full seasons just for the chance to play for a national championship. Why not reward more teams with the chance to achieve this fantasy?
I’m not a college football expert — just an angry, maladjusted fan, if you couldn’t already tell. Still, it’s time to give the demographic and the teams what they deserve. College football is already one of the most binge-worthy and compelling sports to watch on television, so why not up the ante a little bit? But that’s for another column.

No. 25 USC women’s volleyball defeated Arizona 3-1 Saturday evening at Galen Center in its second conference match this season. The Trojans bounced back after Wednesday’s emotional five-set loss to rival UCLA to bring their conference record to 1-1. 
USC seemed like two different teams at times, looking strong in the first and third set but falling off dramatically in the second. The Trojans hit .000 in the second set, their worst single-set hitting percentage all season.
The third set was tightly contested. The score was tied 10 times, and there were six lead changes in the third set alone, while no other set had more than one lead change. USC was aided by an Arizona service error and two service aces by senior libero Jenna Adams in the final 5 points of the match.
The Trojans looked sluggish as they began the fourth set. Arizona jumped out to a 6-2 lead after three consecutive errors by USC.
After this early deficit, second-year head coach Brent Crouch called a timeout to regroup.
“In the fourth, it was going the same way as it was in the second,” Crouch said. “I really challenged the team in a way that I haven’t challenged them yet this year during a timeout at 6-2, and they responded.”
That timeout sparked an 8-1 run for the Trojans, putting them in position to take the fourth set.
 “I think [the timeout] was necessary and needed,” senior middle blocker Jasmine Gross said. “We know we are a great team, but there are times where we need a little bit of a push, and I think [Crouch] did a great job pushing us right when we needed it.”  
Although USC hit a modest .213 in the match, freshman outside hitter Emilia Weske came up big for the Trojans with eight kills and a .438 hitting percentage. The freshman from Potsdam, Germany, continues to solidify her role as an outside hitter for this team. 
Gross was also a key contributor, recording eight kills and a team-high five blocking assists. Gross said Arizona’s fast-paced offense allowed her to have more blocking success than she had against a slower UCLA offense. The Trojans recorded a total of 10 blocks on the game.
USC’s season began with lofty expectations. The Trojans will have to turn things around fast if they still want to compete at a top-5 level.
“It’s time to go on a run,” Crouch said. “We can’t be this up-and-down team that we’ve been where we play some sets and look like a Final Four team, then we play a set and look like [we are] No. 200 in the country.”
Starting out the match strong and faltering somewhere in the middle is quickly becoming a trend for this year’s team. Last week versus UCLA, the Trojans won the first set 25-12 but dropped the second and third, only to lose in the fifth.
“We come out pretty strong then other teams start coming back harder, and we aren’t ready for it,” Gross said. “We just have to keep pushing urgency for every single set.”
Crouch said his team did not leave everything on the court against Arizona. 
“We had lots of swings to get kills, and they were like 60% swings, we weren’t taking rips,” Crouch said. “We won the first set, and we took the foot off the gas. You have to have the pedal to the metal or you aren’t going to win.”
USC still awaits the return of senior opposite hitter Emily Baptista, who had 369 kills in 33 games last season, the third highest total for USC.
The Trojans will face No. 8 Washington 8 p.m. Friday at Galen Center as Pac-12 play continues.

No. 2-seeded junior Daniel Cukierman cruised through the Oracle ITA Masters and defeated top-seed UCLA sophomore Keegan Smith in the title match at the Malibu Racquet Club Sunday.
Cukierman, the only representative from USC at Malibu over the weekend, started his tournament off fast with a 6-0, 6-0 victory over Bryant University senior Guido Argentini. The Round of 16 saw Cukierman defeat Western Michigan senior Jannik Opitz 6-1, 6-3, before he seized two more straight-set wins in the quarterfinal and semifinal matches to reach Sunday’s final.
Smith took the first set in Sunday’s title match and led by a break in the second. However, Cukierman stormed back from a 1-2 deficit to take a 5-2 lead, forcing a third set after a 6-3 win. The Trojan and Bruin were tied up at 3-3 in the third, but Cukierman made a late-game push with a clutch break to move in front 4-3. Cukierman carried his momentum to the finish line, closing out the match in the 10th game to secure a 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 comeback win.
Following Sunday’s victory, head coach Brett Masi praised Cukierman’s resilience during the tournament.
“Leading up to the final, Daniel was the one that took the initiative in the matches,” Masi said.
“Today he had to adapt his game because obviously his opponent was a lot bigger than him … What I like most was that he didn’t get down on himself after the setback — he stayed positive and gave himself a chance at the second set and eventually won the match.”
Although Masi was impressed by Cukierman’s performance, he didn’t seem particularly surprised. 
“He is a top player in the country,” Masi said. “Right now, it’s just about getting his game better and growing — results will keep coming if that’s the case … you’ve got to build yourself up, keep building and then hopefully just keep playing your best tennis toward the end of the year.”
Cukierman’s 2019 victory follows Laurens Verboven’s 2018 crown and Brandon Holt’s 2017 win at the Oracle ITA Masters, making this the third consecutive year a Trojan has won the singles tournament at the event.
Cukierman also teamed up with UCLA redshirt senior Jada Hart for mixed double actions in Malibu. The two marched into the quarterfinals with two quick wins before being edged out in a tiebreak loss to wrap up their run.
On the women’s side, senior Angela Kulikov saw some success with her partner, USC graduate Guiliana Olmos, at the Central Coast Pro Tennis Open in Templeton last week. The pair defeated the No. 1 seed Quinn Gleason and Ingrid Neel, former collegiate players in the Round of 16, advancing to the quarterfinal before capturing another convincing 6-3, 6-2 victory. Kulikov and her partner fell short to the No. 3 seed in the semifinal.
The Trojans look to continue this season’s hot start with the St. Francis Health System ITA All-American championships beginning Oct. 5 in Tulsa, Okla.

The No. 5 USC men’s water polo team took home fifth place at the 2019 SoCal Invitational this weekend at UCLA’s Spieker Aquatics Center.
The Trojans secured a decisive 14-6 victory over No. 14 Princeton to open the weekend Friday. Though the Tigers jumped out to a quick 2-0 lead, USC responded with 5 straight goals. The Trojans entered the second half with a 9-5 lead after allowing just a single goal in the second period. 
Twelve different Trojans contributed to the total team scoring effort, including three freshmen in driver Chris Sturtevant, driver Marcus Longton and 2-meter Grayden Reynolds.
As champions of last year’s invite, USC looked to keep its hopes of a repeat alive on day two of the action. 
Saturday’s doubleheader started with a high-scoring thriller against No. 4 Pacific. Tied 8-8 at the half, the teams battled back and forth throughout the second, but with under five minutes remaining, the Trojans faced a 4-goal deficit. 
Sophomore driver Hannes Daube led a quick three-score surge, bringing him to 5 total goals in the match. But as the last one came with just seven seconds left, it was too late. The Tigers handed the Trojans their second loss of the season and put them out of contention for repeating last year’s victory.
The Trojans refocused and set their sights on the next match of the day against Long Beach State. USC defeated the 49ers 13-6 in its home opener this season and used that familiarity to its advantage in their second meeting. 
Sophomore goalie Nic Porter was a force in the net with 12 total saves, holding down the LBSU offense to no goals in the second period and one in the third. The strong defensive effort secured a 9-6 win and sent USC to the fifth-place match.
Hat tricks from junior driver Jacob Mercep, sophomore 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt and senior driver Marin Dasic helped USC beat Cal 13-12 Sunday morning. The match was remarkably physical, featuring a whopping 36 total exclusions.
“I think at half, we still played good defense not allowing that many goals,” head coach Marko Pintaric said. “Just the tempo of today’s game and the physicality was a little extraordinary, and I think that’s the reason a lot of goals were scored … That attitude [caused] a significant drop in defense.”
Redshirt senior 2-meter Sam Slobodien was a problem for the Cal defense, drawing six of USC’s first seven 6-on-5’s, four of which they converted. The Trojans held an 8-4 lead going into the second half. 
Tensions flared between the two teams in the second half, resulting in numerous whistles.
“We did a good job in the first half, so we just had to stay calm because we know that’s how Cal plays,” Dasic said. “They’re always very aggressive.”
Cal converted on four power plays to bring the deficit to one after trailing 13-8 in the fourth. USC ran down the clock for 20 seconds to edge out the Bears.
“At the end of the day, a win is a win,” Dasic said.
The focus is on defense as the Trojans depart from the invitational section of the regular season.
“We are allowing way too many goals compared to seasons in the past, and the No. 1 focus is on defense for the rest of the season,” Pintaric said. “We have to just become more consistent to play defense throughout the whole game.”
The Trojans will play their second home match of the season at Uytengsu Aquatics Center next Saturday against UC Irvine at 1 p.m.
