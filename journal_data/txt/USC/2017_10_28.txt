It was a huge game — especially considering the season ended last week. After getting its College Football Playoff hopes wrecked at Notre Dame on Week 8, No. 21 USC faced Arizona State on Saturday, hoping to remain in control of at least its conference destiny. A raucous crowd roared on the Sun Devils, as ASU looked to hand the Trojans their second consecutive loss and seize control of the Pac-12 South.
The night — like so many other games this season — began with a whimper at USC’s 25-yard line. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold faked a handoff to junior running back Ronald Jones II but was flushed from the pocket. Darnold danced around the backfield, hesitating to pass twice with no options open, and was pulled down to the turf for a 10-yard loss.

But coming off a 49-14 drubbing in South Bend, the Trojans were in no mood for a rerun of the debacle against Notre Dame. This time, they would wind up on the right side of a 48-17 blowout.
“When you’re trying to win a championship, you have to have one of these victories where you come to another team’s place in a hostile environment and be able to stay in first,” head coach Clay Helton said. “This is what these players and coaches were able to do. I’m extremely proud of them.”
Darnold gave the ball to Jones 15 minutes later — in the opening seconds of the second quarter. Jones exploded through the Sun Devils’ front, then their secondary. A blink and he was across midfield, and then he was gone. Jones pulled up 67 yards later in the end zone. The extra point staked USC a 21-3 cushion. After seemingly playing all season on the back foot, the Trojans were finally dictating the tempo.
“These kids … came out here, they had their jaw set and played some of their best football of the season,” Helton said.
USC regathered quickly after opening the game with a sack. Darnold fired a 12-yard bullet to redshirt freshman wide receiver Tyler Vaughns to move the sticks on third down and found his redshirt freshman receiver again five plays later, firing cross-body while rolling out to his right for a 21-yard catch-and-run. Darnold went for the end zone the very next play, and he dropped a pinpoint pass into junior wideout Deontay Burnett’s outstretched arms. It was the deep shot Trojan fans have rarely seen Darnold execute this season: 32 yards to cap a nine-play, 75-yard drive. For the first time in three weeks, USC got on the board first, racing out to a 7-0 lead.
The two teams traded punts after the opening score, but a blown assignment from sophomore cornerback Jack Jones gifted the Sun Devils 70 yards through the air on their second drive. ASU took advantage with a field goal to cut USC’s lead to four.
But that was as close as the Sun Devils would get. After the two sides traded punts once again near the end of the first quarter, Darnold found Vaughns on a curl route, and a missed tackle from cornerback Kobe Williams allowed Vaughns to streak 42 yards to the pylon. Jones soon followed with his long touchdown run to extend the advantage even further.

As USC pulled away, the Sun Devils struggled to keep their defense off the field, and Vaughns found paydirt for the second time before halftime, when Darnold forced a throw through triple-coverage to find his receiver in the back of the end zone. Vaughns finished the night with 126 receiving yards and two scores — a new career high in both categories.
“Tyler has been a big part to the passing game for a while now,” Darnold said. “I think the way he works and the fact that every single play the ball is coming to him is huge. That’s a really great mentality to have as a receiver.”
A successful Hail Mary from Manny Wilkins to Kyle Williams trimmed ASU’s deficit to 31-10 at halftime, and an opening-drive score in the second half brought the Sun Devils within two touchdowns. But the Trojans responded with a quickfire score of their own: Vaughns took the ball 22 yards on another big catch-and-run, and Jones ran for his second house call of the night, busting out a 64-yard scamper to re-establish USC’s three-touchdown edge. Jones gashed ASU for 216 yards over the course of the game, the majority coming on his pair of long touchdown runs.
“Great offensive line play up front,” Jones said. “Receivers [were] taking away the corners and safeties for me, so [I was] just splitting it, and it comes out to a race.”
The Trojan defense, coming off an undressing against the Fighting Irish, rebounded with a much more encouraging hour against the Sun Devils. Defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s unit was stout when required, highlighted by a turnover on downs to ice the game late in the third quarter and a pick-six by redshirt sophomore safety Ykili Ross late in the fourth quarter. USC sacked Wilkins six times — three coming on a career night from junior defensive end Rasheem Green and the other three from senior linebacker Uchenna Nwosu. Despite still giving up multiple large gains, including the 70-yard blown coverage and first-half Hail Mary, ASU’s 17 points and fewer than 400 total yards were a significant improvement from the 49 points and 497 yards given up to Notre Dame.

“I knew we were going to play like this because it’s in our nature,” redshirt senior safety Chris Hawkins said. “To get beat down — you want to come back and show how good you can really be. I kind of knew we were going to play like this, and I demanded it from my team. As captains we demanded it from our team.”
The Trojans (7-2, 5-1 Pac-12) now gear up for another titanic divisional clash against an Arizona team, as they host the Wildcats in the Coliseum next Saturday. The winner of the tilt will have a clear path to Santa Clara for the Pac-12 Championship in December, and Arizona will fancy its chances after scoring more than 40 points in each of its games this month — including a 58-37 shootout upset over No. 15 Washington State on Saturday.
“I think this is our turning point, if I’m being honest,” Hawkins said. “I think we’re really going to turn it around from here and be the team we really want to be.”

Faculty members of the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work sent a letter to students of the school on Saturday expressing their disapproval of the disciplinary measures USC has taken against Professor Erick Guerrero following a complaint of sexual harassment. At the time of publication, 68 faculty members had signed the letter.
“We simply cannot reconcile the limited sanctions imposed by the University,” the letter read. “This was an egregious exploitation of Professor Guerrero’s power as a trusted faculty member and mentor.”
The letter stated that faculty members were never notified that Guerrero had been sanctioned for the harassment allegations, adding that remaining silent “contributes to the serial perpetration of sexual misconduct.” The letter asked for the University to revisit its decision to not terminate Erick Guerrero.
“Regardless of the reputational consequences to the offender or institution, transparency is critical,” the letter read. “Privacy is often untenable when there are safety concerns.”
Julie Cederbaum, associate professor at the School of Social Work, helped the tenure-line faculty draft the letter. She said that as social workers, it was important for them to stand for justice.
“We have a strong ethical obligation to maintain a safe learning environment,” Cederbaum said. “We need to be leaders in standing up when any of those values are tested.”
On Thursday, Marilyn Flynn, the dean of the School of Social Work, sent a letter to the school’s community urging faculty to open spaces during class to let students ask questions and address concerns regarding the recent news about Guerrero.
“We must always be vigilant,” Flynn wrote. “I will pledge absolutely that anyone who makes a complaint will be protected, and no one will be subject to retaliation.  This is the only way to protect the positive culture we have enjoyed.”
The letter from Dworak-Peck faculty comes three days after Karissa Fenwick, a doctoral student at the School of Social Work, filed a lawsuit against Guerrero and the University.

The suit stated that Guerrero had sexually harassed her in his New Orleans hotel room in January. It also alleged that the University did not sufficiently discipline Guerrero for his actions.
Before filing the lawsuit, Fenwick reported the incident to the USC Office of Equality and Diversity. The OED launched an investigation, which concluded with a letter from the provost’s office suspending Guerrero for a semester without pay starting Fall 2018.
USC’s statement to the Daily Trojan stated that Guerrero was barred from teaching and supervising students starting this academic year.
Guerrero has denied all of the lawsuit’s allegations and filed a demurrer and answer to the complaint following the lawsuit.
“I am here and I am not going anywhere,” Guerrero wrote to the Daily Trojan in a statement on Wednesday. “I would never put myself in a compromising situation that take away all the things I have worked so hard to accomplish.”
The University did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

The Inquisition does not necessarily reflect the consensus opinion of Trojans. Anyone who is interested in understanding the idiocy of these Title IX tribunals should read “Unwanted Advances” by Laura Kipnis. It’s hard to tell whether race was really a factor here, but the woman’s story and motivations are highly questionable. Why is she suing *USC* anyway? If she has a legitimate grievance, she should sue the professor instead. Why is she entitled to our taxpayer money?
She is suing the university because of their lack of transparency and lack of adequate punishment to someone who their own investigation found GUILTY.  The letter here is not some arbitrary Title IX tribunal but a letter of discuss and call for action by USC from his colleague, those who know him and have worked with him since 2009.  Considering the racial, ethnic, and philosophical diversity of the faculty, student groups, and alumni that are siding with Karissa and Student X I highly doubt that race is a factor.  The issue at play as a rampant abuse of power emanating from someone a great deal of power (Guerrero) over someone who has none (students).
If you are worried that your tuition money is being misused please look into how it is being spent you might be surprised by the financial statements (which USC is required to disclose) – specifically how ‘operation costs’ are dispersed.  It sounds like you are concerned that your tuition money might go towards a settlement or ruling in the lawsuit – it wont.  Your tuition money goes to funding building projects, paying professors (like Guerrero (if you are going to argue about this spell his name right)), funding non-federally funded research centers, etc…  USC and other universities have legal insurance for these kinds of issues, meaning that the monies that are awarded are not necessarily coming out of tuition payments, and sometimes are just coming out of a legal insurance policy.
Anywho…I think you are missing the point of all this and why people are upset and why she is suing the university.  If greed was her primary motivation she would not have going through formal university processes for months on end and only sued the university after the punishment was handed down – with many parties deeming it much too lenient.  
Just a general comment: I think you are on the losing side of this issue.  You are resorting to name calling and straw-man arguments – much like our sexual-harasser-in-chief (Trump).  I know both parties in the case and know many others who are involved – personally.  I will say as a character assessment that this is an issue you are ill informed on. 
I stand with those who have been harassed and assaulted – and am happy that we are now in the ear where they are no longer afraid to come forward.  I hope that one day you too will be happy that women (and men) no longer have to living in such a toxic environment.
Just ignore Michael.  He is a troll.  Michael if you are a student…I hope you gain some wisdom with your USC education.  Right now you just look absolutely foolish.
“If greed was her primary motivation she would not have [?] going through formal university processes for months on end and only sued the university after the punishment was handed down.” Logic fail,non sequitur, blue screen of death. Whatever, snowflakes!
That money is still coming out of the pockets of people who work hard for it. Think about it for a second, and you’ll understand. Also, USC receives substantial state and federal funding, dumbass troll.
Oppressed princess? Why do you think it is ok to use that kind of language? You just demonstrated misogyny. You have a lot to learn about victim blaming. Maybe you should take your money elsewhere if you are going to call people names and attack a woman who is clearly traumatized by a threatening event. Shame on you.
