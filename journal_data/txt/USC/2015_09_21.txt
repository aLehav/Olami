This weekend wasn’t exactly ideal. Started Saturday morning with my beloved Arsenal losing to Chelsea. Then my Dodgers lose a close one to the Pirates. Then we get blindsided by a completely new and rejuvenated Stanford team reminiscent of the Andrew Luck years. And to top it all off, UCLA comes back down from 10 points in the fourth quarter to beat a good BYU team. It’s safe to say this report card will not be endearing. The average grade will probably be something close to the first midterm grade for OChem. Yeah, that bad.

The USC Schwarzenegger Institute hosted Andrä Rupprechter, the Austrian Minister for Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management, on Monday evening at the University Club for a roundtable discussion among 31 other guests on the subject of climate change and environmentally sustainable practices.  Guests in attendance included the former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency and the executive director of R20. Former Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger and his predecessor, former Gov. Gray Davis were also in attendance. Thirteen members of the Austrian Trade Commission, Austrian Federal Economic Chamber and the Minister’s office also joined the discussion on global climate change and offered parallels between California and Austria’s climate change programs.
Topics of discussion included the implementation of a universal agreement for a legally binding contract that would enforce rules for accurately reporting, measuring and submitting emission reports at the annual Conference of Parties 21 in Paris in December.
Schwarzenegger began the discussion by comparing both Austria and California’s political, economic and environmental landscape by stating that both are exemplary to the rest of the world and demonstrate that both the subnational and national government are vehicles through which the issue can be approached.
The roundtable discussion honed in on major crises surrounding the issue of creating awareness for climate change. Members of the discussion repeatedly expressed that the general public often equates environmental protection programs with a plummeting economy.
Schwarzenegger explained that it is possible to implement environmental protection programs in conjunction with the creation of a thriving economic system. According to the former governor, partisan debate often leaves officials and their constituents falsely believing that the economy will suffer and thus, draws attention away from the real issue at stake: air pollution and health-related risks associated with poor air quality.
California, Schwarzenegger said, has thrived because it has built upon the work of former governors who did not derail members of the other political party, but continued to work together to combat issues associated with climate change.
“No matter what party you are in or represent, our responsibility is to protect the people,” Schwarzenegger said. “That is our ultimate responsibility and if you want to protect the people — climate change and pollution and this disastrous situation we are in [are] killing people and therefore we should do something about it.”
California Sen. Robert Hertzberg explained the dichotomy between the creation of environmentally friendly innovations and the funding. Members agreed that activists must look to decrease the risk in establishing new policies with technology and should allow partnerships with financiers to become more comfortable.
“The bottom line is this: you start a new company and what happens is you’re taking business from the existing company,” Hertzberg said. “It’s war. It is a financial war. It’s like the telephone industry beating out the telegraph industry, you just have to figure it out.”
Members agreed that activists must look to decrease the risk in establishing new policies with technology and should allow partnerships with financiers to become more comfortable.
“I do think the Kyoto protocols that were done back in 1992 when Clinton was president did not get adopted because there was not enough political pressure and [they got] lost in Congress,” Hertzberg said. “Today there is optimism that we can actually get something done.”

Are these dangerous or sobering thoughts from Donald Trump on what he calls “Climate Blame”?;
“These climate scientists are smart fellas so trust them I say. Trust them to finally say it”s ‘PROVEN’ before it’s too late to say it. It’s only a CO2 Armageddon! It wasn’t a crime for science to say; ‘COULD BE’ the end of days for 34 years but to exaggerate vague science just to hissy fit hate conservatives was a crime. What century is this? The Republican Party demands 97% of the scientists agree it’s “proven” before we goose step our children to the greenhouse gas ovens of an exaggerated crisis. You Goregressives were not “progressives” that’s for sure.”

Audrey Emerson, a third-year student in the School of Cinematic Arts, has completed filming her documentary series, The Pamoja Project, and is now collaborating with the USC Media Institute for Social Change to finish the project.
In June 2015, Emerson organized a team of four USC students and alumni and headed to Tanzania for almost three weeks to film the three 30-minute documentaries that follow the lives of three Tanzanian women. Emerson directed the film with recent alumnus Brandon Somerhalder and Richard Carlos as the director of photography and production sound mixer, respectively, and Kasey Henderson, a junior majoring in policy, planning and development, as the production advisor.
The women who were the subjects of the documentary work in the areas of education, microfinance and health in an effort to create long-term change in their community. In Swahili, the word “pamoja” means “together” and this documentary shares the extraordinary stories of those who work to create change for the people of Tanzania.
“I’ve been lucky enough to be surrounded by the best team and support any filmmaker could ask for,” Emerson said. “The biggest challenge really has simply been to keep pushing myself to the next level, to think bigger and work harder. Sometimes the hardest part is just ‘showing up’ and ‘being seen,’ which to me, means getting up even after making a big mistake.”
Michael Taylor, the founder and executive director of USC MISC, was the executive producer of the film. MISC was established in 2012 and is a nonprofit organization that is composed of industry professionals who focus on creating entertainment media with an emphasis on social change messages. Taylor was involved with the project from the beginning, encouraging and supporting Emerson in raising the necessary funds to create the documentary. He will also have a say in the concepts the documentary presents. With the help of individual donors, grants and an Indiegogo campaign, Emerson was able to raise $30,000.
“This film will really be an inspiration to the people of Tanzania who may not be aware how these three women highlighted in the film are singlehandedly changing the face of their country,” Taylor said. “This film can also be a model for other countries to do similar things and will show how media is a catalyst for change.”
In addition to USC MISC, Devlo Media, an Emmy Award-winning production company, has volunteered to work on the editing phase of the documentary pro bono. John Lavall and Kate Kelly of Devlo Media acted as Emerson’s mentors and prepared her for challenges she would run into while filming in Africa. In addition, Unite the World with Africa, a nonprofit organization that helps empower marginalized women to lead more productive and meaningful lives, is backing the project. Emerson has a long history of working with the organization’s founder, Anne Wells. When Wells heard about Emerson’s plan to create this documentary, she offered the organization’s many resources and support for the film and helped Emerson connect with the three women featured in the documentary.
“I have been to Tanzania dozens of times and the people Audrey is working with are like family to me and very close friends of mine,” Wells said. “I told her what it was going to be like, what to expect, and questions I would ask.”
The film follows the lives of three women who have impacted their community. Sister Crispina established a nursery in Tanzania that now houses 43 children. Margaret works with the Maasai women to help create and market handmade jewelry with the profits filtering back into the community. Astridah teaches young girls who are at a high risk for unwanted pregnancy about various life skills as well as vocational training so that these women can support themselves. Through these women, The Pamoja Project  hopes to teach viewers about development, leadership and true commitment to one’s community.
“I hope they will be inspired to take action in their own lives and that on some level the stereotypes of poverty and helplessness that exist about Tanzania and Africa will start to dissolve as more individual stories of strength come to the forefront,” Emerson said
Upon completion of the editing and post-production phases, Emerson hopes to attend film festivals around the world, host multiple screenings and promote the documentary to schools as an educational tool, ultimately hoping to distribute the film on network TV.

This generation is suffering from a new disease that rarely afflicted previous generations. It’s called early-onset nostalgia, and it must be recognized so we can start treating it.
Early-onset nostalgia is a condition where young adults are longing and yearning for things from a time not that long ago. It’s the ideal that we are quickly designating the recent past as “the good ol’ days.”
This unique, and increasingly less rare, case of nostalgia appears in waves. Most recently, we 20-somethings felt it when Nickelodeon promised a reboot of its classic shows. Scores of ’90s babies started swooning over the thought that their favorite cartoons — I crossed my fingers for Rugrats — would come back on the air.
Nickelodeon wasn’t the first to get our young blood flowing extra fast. The kids channel was falling in line with a long list of TV stations considering bringing back hits from two decades ago. There’s Boy Meets World now revisioned as Girl Meets World, Full House matured as Fuller House and possibly even a Fresh Prince of Bel-Air reboot.
But recently I’ve realized that these #tbt shows are actually not that much of a throwback, or at least not in the sense of how a throwback should be considered.
“Initially #tbt started off as a throwback to your childhood, but now, it’s a throwback to last week,” Jamie Gutfreund, chief marketing officer at the digital agency Deep Focus, told Digiday.
I’m definitely a victim of this mentality. One look at my Instagram shows my reflection on my internship from last fall, or the football game in 2013 when we beat Stanford -— major #tbt — or even as far back as senior year of high school.
Sometimes millennials are yearning for a throwback that are not even ours to long for.
“In terms of trends, what goes around, comes around. This generation is far more in touch with previous generations’ styles and tastes and there’s elements of a greater sense of discovery,” said Professor Marlene Towns at the Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business in June.
The nostalgia for something that isn’t ours is evident in our taste of throwback shows. Most of my favorite childhood shows premiered; some had even gone off the air, before I was even born. Fresh Prince of Bel-Air came out in 1990. Saved by the Bell was in 1989. Rugrats was born in 1990. I made my world premiere years later in 1994.
It’s hard to pinpoint what exactly is wrong with nostalgia — we assume that it comes with the territory of becoming an adult. But in the grand scheme of life, two decades is barely any time. And when we’re constantly surrounded by technology that can help us relive the past, we shouldn’t be so obsessed with idolizing it.
I’m not a doctor, so I can’t make an exact diagnosis for this early-onset nostalgia. But after consulting some experts in the field, I would say it’s our information overload.
Technology is rapidly changing our perception of the past. With social media, you can always be right there when an event breaks — and god forbid if you’re not attached to your Twitter timeline during a major event. It’s as if the whole world has consumed the news, and by the time we try to catch up we’ve already moved on.
Yet this is detrimental to our collective memory as a generation. Marketing agencies and advertisers thrive on the idea that every generation experiences events at once. That’s why it’s economically smart for Nickelodeon to revive old shows that already have a strong viewership base.
But the past can’t be the past if we keep digging it up. The recent reboot of ’90s shows is uprooting collective memory. Collective memory, which is the memory of a specific group of people passed down through the generations, comes from retelling past events — and even if they get misremembered — and they continue to take up a very fond space in our hearts.
It’s kind of like a high school yearbook. You only have a frozen-in-time image of someone when he or she was 18, and then the idea is only changed once you see that person 30 years later for the high school reunion. Yet Facebook lets you see those high school friends’ progression on a day-to-day basis.
We’ve lost our sense of what the past really is because we never let it go.
That’s why it’s not a good idea to put our favorite shows back on the air. So even though I’m excited about prospectively watching the Rugrats now that I’m all grown up, I really don’t want this trend of reboot after reboot to continue.
I want future generations to be able to continue to say, “Back in my day …” and truly have a reason to say it.

In a recent viral post on Facebook, Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath recounted a story in which a man allegedly hurled racially charged insults and a drink cup at her as she walked past his fraternity house. Sampath’s popular post — which has garnered thousands of likes and hundreds of shares — implored USC students not only to think about discrimination but also to stand up for fellow Trojans.
Sampath is absolutely correct: Enough is enough. USC should be a safe and inclusive place for all people. It is unlikely that anyone on this campus disagrees with that sentiment.
Trojans know that inclusivity is a problem at USC. In Spring 2013, nearly 80 LAPD officers aggressively broke up a house party primarily attended by black students, arresting six students in the process. USC’s response was to hold a public forum, but little changed. Recently, the “I, Too, Am USC” Tumblr page began detailing harassment against “marginalized communities,” according to the page.
But these words, as well-liked and frequently shared as they are, can only go so far. The greek system is powerful, entrenched and set in its ways at USC. Fraternities and sororities spend more effort on parties, matching t-shirts and hair flips than they do on improving their relations with marginalized communities. Those actions tell the USC community where greek priorities lie.
That’s not to say that everyone involved with greek life on campus is discriminatory or a bad person. Rather, as an institution, the greek system allows a certain level of intolerance from individuals and does not do enough to combat that injustice.
Problematically, USC seems to be gearing up for more talks instead of pressing for action. Monday morning the Washington Post quoted USC Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni, who said that USC wants “to create a dialogue” about the incident. Soni further said that Sampath will be able to create a conversation on campus. USC has hosted conversations before, from presentations and forums from nearly every group on campus and the high-profile discussion mentioned above after the incident in 2013, to investigations in student publications about race, identity and inclusivity on campus. These are all powerful voices, but they have obviously not changed race relations enough on campus to prevent the alleged racial attack on Saturday night.
Instead of more talks or discussions, the University and Sampath need to act. There are three ways to change behavior: carrots, sticks and sermons. Sampath, USC’s public forums and others have delivered the sermons — now it is time to use carrots and sticks to encourage change. Carrots encourage socially beneficial behavior, such as completing diversity trainings or incorporating new minority members into the greek system, by handing out USC- or USG-backed benefits to compliant greek houses. Sticks discourage socially harmful behavior, like hurling epithets or drink cups at others, by sanctioning noncompliant organizations and revoking their privileges.
To begin, USC needs to investigate this incident and be prepared to punish the alleged perpetrator. Soni correctly encouraged Sampath report the incident to USC’s Bias Assessment Response & Support office, which handles discrimination. But regardless of whether Sampath reports the incident, USC should investigate, and, if the alleged perpetrator is found to be culpable under applicable USC standards, punish him accordingly. USC’s Title IX office is already empowered to investigate sexual misconduct without a victim’s report “where there is evidence that a respondent (whether an individual student or organization) may pose a substantial threat to the safety or well-being of one or more members of the university community,” and the Bias Assessment Response & Support office should be similarly empowered, if it is not already, and should investigate this incident, because this kind of discrimination poses a substantial threat to the university community.
This problem will take more than words because the issue is entrenched in large, slow-changing organizations. No sermon, however powerful, will change intolerant behavior overnight in an institution as big as USC greek life. Instead, USC and Sampath must reward institutional and individual compliance with SCampus anti-discrimination policies, and, more importantly, punish malfeasance. Taking away the parties, matching t-shirts and hair flips that the Row holds so dearly will lead to compliance. Compliance will become acceptance, acceptance will become the norm and eventually diversity and inclusion will be an institutional value in USC greek life.
The student body and the student press should watch and ensure that USC and Sampath follow through with their promises to fight discrimination at USC. The University has a long history of hosting talks, but problems persist. Sampath also has a record of making promises and not following through. In a retrospective on the Menard-Sampath administration published in February 2015, the Daily Trojan noted, “Some of the hoped-for changes have yet to be made, though progress has been ongoing.” While that standard may be satisfactory for the dozens of campaign pledges Sampath made while running twice for school-wide election, it is not acceptable for an issue this integral to the Trojan Family.
Sampath’s words are powerful. She and USC need to follow them up with even more powerful actions to create lasting changes. USC will be watching.
Why is it so hard to believe that this COULD have happened?  I don’t really think a person in her position would claim such an incident happened on a Saturday night on The Row–with allegedly more than one frat brother around, not to mention whoever she was with, and whoever may (or may not) have been within earshot.  I think she is avoiding attention by not publicly naming the person or the fraternity, and likely all those involved have been instructed not to discuss the matter by the university’s (or their own) legal counsel.  
If this did happen, it should be the fraternity that should step up and take responsibility for the actions of their members, apologize and punish the member accordingly.  Fraternities (and sororities) these days need to work double time to get past their images if they want to stay relevant in the collegiate world for years to come, like it or not.  Schools are working hard to become more diverse, and with that diversity comes fewer people who are willing to put up with the status quo. 
You’ll never be the jerk for feeling angry that this might have happened, but you will definitely be the jerk assuming it didn’t.
“You’ll never be the jerk for feeling angry that this might have
happened, but you will definitely be the jerk assuming it didn’t.”
You hit the nail on the head and destroyed your own argument. She is using her lie to grandstand and garner attention. In today’s society, especially on college campuses, the benefit goes to the woman or the minority claiming these things happened; in her case it’s a double whammy. Women like her make shit like this up all the time. Just look at the woman who carried around the mattress she was allegedly raped on, she was proven to be a liar.
It’s cute that your tactic here is to try to be the most offensive to garner the most attention.  What was that again about attention seeking behaviors?
Then obviously you need to learn how to present more concise and precise points. Perhaps you should take a few more English classes and pay less attention to social issues.
She claimed the incident happened. Said she does not want to make a big deal about it. But she posts on public social media platform which people WILL SEE. She accepts to do interviews with website like Cosmopolitan which people WILL SEE. And the incident leads to opinion articles like this which people WILL SEE. Sounds like she seeking attention for her greater aims. Dragging public support with her under the banner “You don’t agree with my position than your a jerk and part of the problem”
Why don’t you ask the young girls and boys of Germany how diversity is going for them? Or you could ask the 1400 odd children of Rotherham, England how forced cultural diversity helped them too.
“I don’t really think a person in her position would claim such an incident happened on a Saturday night on The Row–with allegedly more than one frat brother around, not to mention whoever she was with, and whoever may (or may not) have been within earshot.”
–“Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, and eventually they will believe it”
if it happened, at least it was overt.  micro/passive/overt aggression is much more common.  ever look at an asian with a tilted head?  that’s prohibited in some companies (someone at starbucks actually got fired for doing that).
and who took away the capital letters on the university homepage?
So asking someone who speaks broken English to repeat himself is racist now? What is I asked an American with a thick Virginian or Minnesotan accent to do the same? Would or should I get fired from Starbucks then? What kind of sick ride are we on?
it depends, but that is my point exactly: passive aggression is a dangerous problem because it’s hard to prove.   in that sense it’s like stealing: it allows someone to make an attack without owning up to it.  it’s a problem of the generation and only something i really started noticing post-9’11.
Can you repeat that? I didn’t quite get it.
Rachel Dolezal, the next generation
Her facebook post indicates she was walking with her friends on Saturday night when the alleged incident occurred.  Thus, it should be no problem for law enforcement to investigate the alleged “hate crime” and interview each and every one of these friends individually to get the exact details of the alleged incident.  
That NO ONE has come forward publicly with CORROBORATING evidence to support this claimed incident, now over 4 days later, speaks volumes as to the reality of this claim.  Much as with Rachel Dolezal and her fabricated hate crimes as well as many MANY others like it, I am certain the truth of the matter will come out eventually.
This is ridiculous, Rini is a freaking whiner who just wants attention. This incident has been overblown.
She is grand-standing with the incident. She is using this situation as a precedent for a propaganda push for “safe zones, gender neutral bathrooms” the list goes on. It is all in her interview with cosmopolitan.
She seems a bit crazy.
All people in any political position have ideologies and objectives when they hold any office regardless of power level. They have objectives that do not fit the needs the people who elect them. She has shown her true colors here by such a statement and by her recent moves.
Oh my god, yup, once I read that, I realized it was hopeless. She’s a nut, and she probably did make this up. She has an agenda.
Nobody did anything to her, she is a liar.
The person who hurled the abuses at her is apparently not crazy !
Nobody did anything to her, she is a liar. Just trying to get attention.
Please do not preach to us about discrimination.   We have got MS and PhD degrees as foreign (Indian) students in USC.  We used to encounter a lot of discrimination, well over two orders of magnitude of what was faced by Rini Sampath.  By the way, people like me in India had learnedto speak like Ronald Colman, Errol Flynn, Michael Caine, Roger Moore, and Gregory Peck (different accents in English language).  Yet we ere overlooked for teaching positions because we were raised in a foreign country.  The teaching positions went to some Eastern Europeans and Western Europeans who had problems related to both speaking and writing.
Why are you promoting the discrimination of Eastern and Western Europeans? You are literally triggering me right now. Please censor yourself and check your Indo-Aryan privilege!!
I am not promoting anything.  You are trying to cover up things that will not augur well for our great university.  It will end up like the heavily over-blown Reggie Bush matter and that caused severe but damage to USC football,
I do not think he is covering up anything…I doubt he flagged your comments like others have done to him. Your comments are here and this article is here for everyone to see. He is attempting to provide a rational angle to this whole fairy tale.
So what!  As a white person, you can abuse her ?!
Your adhominem and discrimnatory attacks have no place here. Come back once you have thought your life over.
Our university is the hub of racism, and you want Rini Sampath to keep quiet!  She also won the election as an undergraduate student president.

You have pretty much defeated yourself there. “We have Racism!!!!!” But the majority White European campus elected an Indian undergraduate president…… You seem to defeat your own argument.
This incident, overblown?  I highly doubt it ever took place!
question for somebody on the Row: is there any chance that this really happened?
No just some social justice curry cunt trying to get attention.
None.  Absolutely none.  Certainly not randomly as her facebook alleges.  Either this is hardly the full story, or, as is my strong suspicion, this is yet another false claim by yet another victim desperate for attention and/or to deflect from some conflict or turmoil in her life.  There is a story making its rounds that she is under investigation for controversially and most likely illegally filling positions in the USG with her friends and cronies.
To Alex Hartmann-I hope that post is a joke even though it isn’t a good one. You sure have rights to your opinion but something tells me you would object if you were the subject of an attack other than the one you posted. To be able to live through something like that and come out learning from it is a reason to be proud. Unfortunately, you seem to be proud of your attitude towards certain members of our community. It won’t make anyone go away nor will your fears. You need to find an African-American that doesn’t fit your stereotype and find out why you feel the way you do. You also need to find a woman that will teach you what an important part of society they are; life 100+ years ago was much different and that fit your sentiment. Thankfully things have changed. I’ll bet you have very few friends that don’t fit your profile and that will cause you problems in the future. USC and adulthood go hand in hand; learn something new each day or quit school and move to somewhere that everyone looks like you. That is not so threatening and you will still feel like you do 50 years from now.
I do not believe her. She is looking for attention.
I agree.
Just keep your opinion to yourself.
Isn’t it your opinion that I should?
Women were never meant to survive in a man’s world. It’s been that way since our ancestors walked upright. Traditional gender roles weren’t created as some sort of handcuff to keep the other sex down or lift the other up, they organically took shape over thousands of years. Since the women’s suffrage movements these gender roles have been more and more turned on their head, against the will of most women. Situations like this will occur, men have had to deal with the abuse of other men throughout history but they’ve for the most part dealt with it and persevered. Now women face these issues so they bitch and moan about it because they can’t deal with their problems and struggles by themselves because they’re the weaker sex. So now it’s not only the man’s job to do the lion’s share of humanity’s workload, but now we are also tasked with protecting women who, by their own freewill, thrust themselves into a man’s world.
As far as colored folks go, I’ll keep my distance and make sure they keep theirs. Their criminal statistics, not their stereotype is the reason for that.
If one does not take pride in his beliefs what else is there for him to live for? To hold one’s belief in the highest regard is at the forefront for the absolute victory of his goals
To be fair there is no proof that the events Ms. Sampath recounted in her social media post ever happened. We need to keep in mind that she is a woman and women are pathological liars. I was robbed at knifepoint by two African American men. I think they should be removed from the campus so it can become more of a safe place. Whenever I see blacks about it triggers me. They also stink and should use different bathrooms, they always make the place smell of musk and cocoa butter. If Sampath can’t handle the bantz maybe she should go back to her ancestral homeland and take her rightful place in the designated shitting street. These frat guys sound like they’re too big of guys for her.
And for you

Racists are a subset of a**holes. We seem to be focused on the fact when a**holes act mean towards a “victim-group”. The truth of the matter is being an a**hole is reprehensible regardless of the fact if the meanness is being acted upon a minority group or not. Would it actually not be as much a slight against our fellow human being if the frat douche said something mean towards another frat bro and threw a cup at him?
If he said it to another male there would not be an issue here. Both of them could have either confronted each other or the guy (or victim) could get over it. Why the opinions of probably drunk student matter to her personal well-being is beyond me and beyond reason. However, because she is a girl she takes emotion into account and decides to play the victim card when nothing of value was said and nothing of value was lost by saying it. Hartman was right about emotional and physical differences between women. No idea why he was censored for stating his opinion wether its fact or not. In the words of John Stuart Mill “But the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they [society] are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and the livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.”
Typical racist white frat tards
So Alex Hartman’s comments get moderated, but not this illogical degenerate piece of discrimination? What are the priorities of this paper?
To protect those who make unfounded charges.

Earlier this month, San Diego State University released its 18th annual “Boxed In” report, a study centered on women’s roles in the television industry. From the people working behind the scenes to leading actresses on the scene for 2014 to 2015, the number of women in television continues to be lower than their male counterparts in corresponding fields. Of course, this is no surprise. But the numbers themselves prove interesting to dissect, if only in the hopes that they will continue to change in the years to come.
Female directors account for 14 percent of the market, which is up a meager 1 percent from the previous year. However, the study found that in cases where at least one woman was a creator on the show, the number of female writers increased, which no doubt puts a positive light on the encouraging community female television leaders can create. The stereotype that women can be catty in the workplace just doesn’t hold up. But obviously, we still have a long way to go, as the report goes on to say.
The report’s author, Martha Lauzen, states, “The findings suggest that creators and executive producers play an instrumental role in shifting the gender dynamics for both on-screen characters and other individuals working in powerful behind-the-scenes roles.” She goes on to point out that broadcast programs with at least one female creator show a writing staff comprised of 50 percent female writers. On programs without a female creator, the number of female writers drops to a mere 15 percent, which clearly demonstrates the great disparity and unfair disadvantage women have in the writers’ room helmed by a man.
The study not only takes into account broadcast and cable networks, but it also opens up its field of research to include original series from streaming services. As the television industry expands outside the confines of a literal boxed television screen, it will be interesting to see how these numbers shift and change, if at all. A possible indicator may be Amazon’s original series Transparent which could be a positive push in the right direction.  Not only is Transparent creator and showrunner Jill Soloway a woman, but she also pointedly aims to employ diverse people of different minorities and sexual orientations. The show itself is also a marvel in subject matter: Three grown siblings find out their over 60-year-old father actually wants to be a woman. Though the premise may read as an unfunny ’90s sitcom, the actual drama of the show is dealt with the utmost of art. There are comedic moments, but Transparent is a very serious show with thematic sophistication. Additionally, the show is not only an Emmy winner, but has also been renewed for a total of three seasons, emphasizing just how successful a series of such a taboo subject can actually fare.
When it came to which networks did the best in employing women, the study also found that ABC paved the way with 45 percent of their characters being women. ABC is responsible for shows such as Scandal, Once Upon a Time, Revenge, Grey’s Anatomy, How to Get Away with Murder and Nashville. Several of those series have been created by trailblazing USC alumna Shonda Rhimes — another leading force in the industry who is notable for hiring women on her shows and for her self-created production company, Shondaland, a universe where women are the protagonists. Also among that list is ABC’s Nashville, a show not only created by esteemed female screenwriter Callie Khouri — who is responsible for the pioneering 1991 feminist film Thelma & Louise — but is currently run by Dee Johnson (a woman), and is composed of eight women on a 13-person staff, in addition to two female writing assistants.
The most upsetting finding of the report was not the example of ageism in the industry, where a 20-year-old actress is most often paired with a 40-year-old actor and never vice versa. That type of discrimination is basically an absolute fact by this point, as is the ageism where most actresses are “too old” by the time they are 35. Rather, the real crime here is in the numbers for female directors of photography. As was the case last year, the number of female cinematographers working in television shows in the past year was 2 percent. That’s right — just 2 percent.
Where women seem to have broken the celluloid ceiling and effectively infiltrated the producer and writer arenas, of which there are 38 percent and 26 percent women represented in the industry, respectively, somehow women have not been able to break into the cinematography world. As a film school student surrounded by equally inspiring women and men working on projects at USC, I find it hard to believe that there is a shortage of female talent. The excuse, “well, women just don’t want to be directors of photography,” rings completely false. Therefore, it remains clear that directors in television, comprised of 86 percent men, seem to want a male presence directly behind the lens.
The bias is clearly at play in Hollywood today, and I don’t see the trend changing any time soon. The only way for this statistic to dramatically adjust in the next 10 years is if female directors become increasingly more dominant in the field. Because, as the report has shown with the number of female producers directly corresponding positively to female writers on staff, we need more female directors to employ a positive female presence in order to actually see change happen. But whether that will actually occur remains to be debated.

Earlier this month, LA Opera opened their newest season with a double bill of treasured Italian operas. Puccini’s farce Gianni Schicchi, produced by famed director Woody Allen and paired with Franco Zeffirelli’s colorful staging of Leoncavallo’s tragic Pagliacci, offered a successful performance of the verismo masterpieces. Internationally renowned tenor and general director of LA Opera Plácido Domingo works double duty in this production as singer and maestro, performing the title role in Gianni Schicchi and conducting more than 100 musicians and singers in Pagliacci.
In this stylish production of Gianni Schicchi, which premiered at the  LA Opera in 2008, Allen combines monochromatic aesthetics with the tongue-in-cheek bravura of old Italian cinema — the opening “credits” attribute the show to the fictional “Prosciutto e Melone Production” — to create a sensual film noir-like atmosphere. Gianni Schicchi depicts the shenanigans that ensue over the will of a recently deceased relative, sending the family into an uproar. As the cunning titular character, Domingo was clearly the crowd favorite, garnering applause the moment he stepped on stage and receiving the largest ovation at the end of the performance. Domingo proved with this role, as well as his role as conductor, that he could essentially do whatever he wants and still attract a soldout house.
Other standouts include Meredith Arwady as Zita, cousin to the deceased relative. Arwady possesses a colossal voice that envelopes audiences within a wall of sound. In the roles of the forlorn lovers Rinuccio and Lauretta, Arturo Chacón-Cruz and Andriana Chuchman sang with earnest tone and sincere chemistry that elicited audible gasps from several patrons in the audience. Also worth noting is Peabody Southwell, in the often unremarked role of La Ciesca, who sang with a full-body mezzo and an oozing sexuality that never lost its appeal.
I Pagliacci (Italian for the clowns) is Leoncavallo’s only regularly performed work, depicting the inner turmoil within a traveling troupe of commedia dell’arte actors. Updated to the modern-day streets of Italy, Zeffirelli’s production offers show-stopping glamour and theatrics, including automobiles, live animals and a chorus of over 100 singers. As conductor, Domingo was less thrilling; there seemed to be a disconnect between him and the musicians. However, the audience showed no signs of dissatisfaction because as stated earlier, he can essentially do whatever he wants and get away with it.
As Canio, the leader of the troupe, Marco Berti attains a very large and respected sound. Though his tone wavered a bit in his first scenes, he finished the act strongly with the show’s renowned aria “Vesti la Giubba,” drawing considerable applause from the audience.
Ana María Martinez is nothing short of spectacular as Canio’s wife, Nedda, navigating into her upper register with absolutely no signs of strain. As Nedda’s lover Silvio, LA Opera favorite Liam Bonner possesses a rich timbre that lends itself well to Italian opera, and blended deliciously with Martinez’s voice. Their Act I duet was the highlight of the afternoon.
Also worth noting was George Gagnidze as the vindictive Tonio and Brenton Ryan as the wily Beppe, both actors within the commedia dell’arte troupe. USC alumnus Arnold Livingston Geis made his LA Opera debut in the role of First Man. Geis proved with this role that there is no such thing as a small role; he sang and acted beautifully.
Just three more performances remain in the show’s must-see run: Sept. 24 at 7:30 p.m., Sept. 27 at 2 p.m. and Oct. 3 at 7 p.m.

Student Mackin Carroll, the bassist of newly-found band Felix, sat down with the Daily Trojan for a Q & A about the band’s projects, direction, and musical inspirations.  Hawken Miller | Daily Trojan
Last Friday, I had the opportunity to sit down with Mackin Carroll, a sophomore majoring in popular music with an emphasis in songwriting and bass at the Thornton School of Music. We talked about his personal musical ventures and Felix, a new band he formed with fellow students Jack DeMeo, Cooper Bell, Carter Couron and Larry Scanniello.  Combined with Carroll’s introspective songwriting and the rest of the group’s devotion to music, their band is sure to be a hit.
Q: What kind of projects are you working on in this coming year?
We’re called Felix right now but we’re looking to change our name.  We have an EP coming out that we’re mixing right now. It’s five songs recorded here on campus, and then partially off campus as well. We’ll be playing around campus and hopefully Hollywood. I’m also recording a five song EP of my own — like acoustic kind of folk stuff. One of the EPs is with the band, which is very collaborative. And then solo stuff. I’m playing bass –– you know there’s a cool music scene here at USC.  A lot of people collaborate and help each other out. I’m [alsp] playing bass in my friend Andrew Stogel’s band called LOVEYOU. It’s his music –– I’m just playing the bass guitar. 
Q: As a musician, what are some of your dreams and aspirations?
A: I really just want to make records. If I can build a lifestyle that allows me to make albums and just do creative stuff. I want to make a comfortable living from my creative efforts — that would be awesome. Anything on that would be gravy. 
Q: Are you more into writing music then?
A: Yeah, I love performing as well, but I love writing. I would like to have a career where I have a hand in what’s being played. Because I love playing and stuff like that, but I love playing stuff that I’ve had a hand in shaping. There’s an emotional risk performing your own material that happens. It’s frightening but there’s also this wonderful emotional reward if you perform it successfully and connect with people.
Q: What’s been your favorite venue to perform at?
A: For me, personally, there’s this place called Room 5 in La Brea and it’s really nice because the people that are there are really there to listen. Because it’s upstairs at this Italian restaurant and so its all wooden.  A lot of times you’re playing at a place where people don’t really want to hear music.  As for the band we are hoping to play at some cool clubs and stuff after the release of the EP. 
Q: When did you start your band Felix?
A: In January, actually. We hit the ground running. We were all waiting to meet like-minded people and so there was no waste in time when we got started.
Q: What are the names of your band members?
A: I’m Mackin Carroll, bassist. My friend, Jack DeMeo, plays guitar and sings. There’s Cooper Bell, who plays keyboards and shaker and tambourine and sings — one of those miscellaneous guys. There’s Carter Couron, he plays the drums; and then there’s Larry Scanniello, he plays the lead guitar.
Q: How did you get the name Felix?
A: There’s Felix, the car dealership up on Figueroa and that was close to where we rehearsed.  Every time we would come out of rehearsal it would just be there and it seemed appropriate and a nice artifact that tied everything together.
Q: Do you have a favorite genre of music?
A: I really like sad-guitar music. Like Elliott Smith. I definitely have a pretty eclectic taste in music.  Sometimes I listen to Hank Williams and sometimes Kendrick Lamar and Jelly Roll Morton and Ben Folds Five. The undercurrent is people being themselves in a cool way. 
Q: What kind of themes do you write about in your songs?
A: A lot of it is just whatever I’m going through at the time when I write. I try not to think about it before hand — like “I’m going to write a song about fear.”  That feels backwards to me. Not everything is a fact about my life but I try to connect to the things that I write so I can sing them with some sort of conviction. The new EP is about coming to terms with your own insecurities. I have a song called Everything is Temporary that is about things being transient. I guess my themes are existential, coming-of-age, average-white-20-year-old-bullsh*t.
Q: Have you learned anything that you’ve been able to apply to your music?
A: In high school, I would be taking geometry class and I’d be like, okay I understand how this is training a certain part of my brain and indirectly connecting it to whatever I want to do.  At the Thornton School of Music, I’m taking all things that are directly honing the skills that I’m using.  Private lessons are good for me to pay specific attention to what I’m doing. I’ll learn something in the morning in my music theory class about chord structure and then go write a song later using one of those concepts and maybe play it the next week.
Q: Who is the person that you look up to the most and who you want to be in the future?
A: I really look up to Ben Folds, just because he seems to have a reverence for informal music and popular traditions and rock and folk traditions but he also has such an appreciation for classical and formal music. He tends to integrate the informal and the formal. Ben Folds doesn’t see the divisions as much and integrates and learns from other’s music forms and combines things. It’s more celebratory and looking at the commonalities of things. 
He just wrote a concerto for his last album for the piano and he did a song with a chamber orchestra.  But he also did a spoken word collaboration with William Shatner, and also the Ben Folds Five is this awesome rock group that does a cover of B*tches ain’t Sh*t but Hoes and Tricks by Dr. Dre.  He has a wonderful sincere appreciation for all facets of music.  He’s open minded and not afraid to be that way. I would like to get [a few] close-minded rock and roll kids to listen to Chopin and [a few] close minded classical kids to go to a punk show. 
Q: Do you have a favorite song by him?
A: That’s a good question –– there’[re] so many. The second Ben Folds album is called Whatever Whatever Amen and I like albums a lot from start to finish. I like the songs Philosophy and Cigarette (it’s this sentence that he read in an article that he sets to music in the most beautiful way possible). The song Underground does a really great job of integration.
Q: What do you think of the direction popular music is heading?
A: I feel like people are always writing great songs but it’s just a little bit harder to find them.  You hear people complaining, “Man, why is everything so fake now.” No, it’s not — you’re just lazy. With Spotify and the Internet, things are a little bit more niche oriented and hidden in their own little spheres. Tame Impala is doing things that are clearly informed from the past and also innovating and adding a new thing to it that’s so cohesive and interesting. Now we’re getting into streaming and it’s just really weird as someone who is putting out music. Should I print CD’s or just put it on the Internet? We don’t know how to distribute music now. 
The pubescent era of digital music is maturing. People are always going to find a way to make art — that’s not going to stop. It’s ambitious to say that you think something is great before everyone else has said so.  It infuriates me when people say that music is dead. People aren’t going to stop writing.

These days, it seems like the latest health trends center on hyper-nutrient green items. We have all read once or twice about our good friend kale or enjoyed the elegant, refreshing taste of spinach in our smoothies, but there’s another green ingredient we need to remember to add to the mix: matcha.
Matcha, a catchy word and dynamic powder made from green tea leaves, is a mood-enhancing, chlorophyll-rich antioxidant that doubles as a sugar-free powerhouse coffee substitute. Matcha lattes, matcha smoothies, matcha muffins, matcha you-name-it can be found at local coffee shops, from Starbucks to Coffee Bean, as well as an abundance of special matcha-teria’s opening up in L.A. According to CBS News, matcha tea sales in the U.S. have increased five-fold in 25 years to more than $10 billion dollars.
So what is all the hype over this green goddess? Matcha isn’t just tasty and refreshing ­­—it’s considered to have more health benefits and 10 times the amount of antioxidants than the typical, straight cup of green tea.

“With matcha, you are consuming 100 percent of the leaf, rather than just what’s steeped outside into the water, as you would with green tea,” Jessica Lloyd and David Mandelbaum of famous matcha company Panatea told New York Magazine. Lloyd and Mandelbaum also said that with only 34 milligrams of caffeine and high levels of amino acids like L-theanine, drinking a serving of matcha gives a feeling of “calm alertness.”
It keeps energy levels up for three to six hours so that you are more present during the day. It also is low in acidity and easier to digest unlike coffee, which upsets many people’s stomachs. Drinking matcha also doesn’t come along with the jitters and crashes that one may experience when drinking coffee.
Matcha can be easily prepared: poured into a cup of warm or ice cold milk, brewed into a latte, blended into a smoothie or added to home-baked treats.
All that glitters though is not gold — or green. Even though matcha is rich in antioxidants and loaded with health benefits, it is hard on the wallet. Matcha is a drink of expense as well as with anything in excess it can and should only be enjoyed in moderation.
Here’s not to say that you shouldn’t splurge because it is absolutely quite tasty. Check out these places in L.A. that serve this Insta-worthy delicacy and see for yourself:

Reggie Bush will forever be remembered as one of the greatest running backs ever to pass through USC. He was a  two-time All-American and a Heisman trophy winner, and he was drafted second overall in the 2006 NFL Draft. When Trojan fans look back on Bush’s time at ’SC, they will fondly remember Bush and quarterback Matt Leinart together as a reminder of the glory days. He left a legacy at USC that will never be forgotten.
I especially remembered Reggie Bush on Saturday, when I watched the Trojan defense suffer from a lack of depth and fall apart in the fourth quarter as Stanford came from behind to pull off the upset. Every win Bush brought to USC, in the form of various awards as well as games, was vacated after the NCAA came down on USC for awarding Bush improper benefits and revoked 30 scholarships over three years. USC was forced to forfeit all wins from the 2004-2005 season and Heritage Hall is short one Heisman trophy.
But to me, none of that really matters. Sure, I love going to a school with a tradition of football dominance. I love being ranked in the preseason top 25 every year just because we’re USC. But I would have all of that without Reggie Bush. USC was a powerhouse before Reggie Bush, and even though he contributed to USC’s reign, he ultimately did more bad than good. Matt Leinart also won a Heisman at USC, and I’m fairly confident that he still would’ve done so without Bush as a teammate. I’m also pretty sure USC would’ve still been a top team without Bush, since we had a leader like Leinart.
Trojan football feels Bush’s legacy now more than it ever did while he was on the field. By now, the Reggie Bush scandal is old news. USC forfeited wins, Bush gave up his Heisman and left for the NFL and USC was docked 30 scholarships over three years.
It’s 10 years later, and the Trojans are still in the wake of Bush’s scandal. Last season’s fallout was largely a result of a lack of depth on defense. It was evident in the fourth quarter when the defense just couldn’t hold up any longer, and the opposing team was able to seal the deal. That’s exactly what happened on Saturday.
I think one of the reasons Cody Kessler is so underrated is because he’s on a team with a struggling defense. He set records last season, but his team went 9-4. I’m not at all saying that the defense is entirely to blame for going 9-4, and Sarkisian and the offense certainly had some room for improvement, but last-minute losses seemed to be a common occurrence last season.
Unfortunately for Kessler, if Saturday is any indication of the rest of this season, his Heisman campaign is over before it ever really began. Kessler was 2-0 against Stanford and Kevin Hogan before Saturday night and has proven that he is capable of outdueling the Cardinal. The difference between the last two matchups and this year’s game was the number of points the defense allowed. Stanford is always a tough game, even when they are unranked, and the game has come down to a field goal in the previous two seasons. This year, the defense allowed 41 points. Kessler and the offense managed to put up 31 points of their own, which should have been enough to keep any good team in the game, but the pattern held true and the defense fell apart in the fourth quarter.
It’s impossible to pin Saturday’s loss on any one thing in particular, just as it is impossible to pin the NCAA sanctions on Reggie Bush. Sarkisian and defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox definitely weren’t perfect, and the offense missed some opportunities late in the game that could have prevented the upset.
This week’s road game against ASU will truly make or break the rest of the season, and I just hope that a lack of defensive depth isn’t to blame for a team with talent like USC having back-to-back 9-4 seasons.

It is easy to place the blame on unjust NCAA treatment, but champions rise above the challenges. We have great players that were the tops in their respective high schools. What have the current coaches done to prepare these players for long slogs with schools like Stanford? Do the players respect the coaches? Do the players feel like they are a team?
It’s not just the preparation.  It’s the execution of the game strategy, the reassessment during the game, and the adjustments during the game.  As Coach Sarkisian says, “we’ve got to coach it.”

While sporting overalls that appear to be part of an angler’s wardrobe on the cover of his new album Another One, Mac DeMarco is reeling in audiences with his latest eight-track production, released last month on Aug. 7. DeMarco has steadily gained supporters with the success of previous releases such as 2 and Salad Days, along with a world tour and a current U.S. tour. Known for his signature gap-toothed grin and quasi-tropical beach guitar tone, DeMarco’s strong fan base will undoubtedly be pleased with his latest release that will be featured on his next tour.
Another One starts off with “The Way You’d Love Her,” featuring DeMarco’s signature guitar sound. It has different flangers, chorus and reverberation effects that have given his previous albums a spacy, drifting vibe. This sound complements the acoustic studio drum styles that lay down the grooving rhythms.
In the track titled after the album, DeMarco adds a simple electric synth that adds a deeper tone to a heartfelt arrangement. It keeps from being overproduced while  remaining soulful. Mac’s voice, which does not often explore a great range, maintains a day-dreamy, wondering presence through the album, and as he sings on the title track, “Afraid she might not love you anymore/And though she says she does and hasn’t lost your trust/Who could be there knockin’ at her door/Must be another one.” DeMarco might seem to have an off-beat, humorous personality during live shows and interviews, but on “Another One” he is certainly in tempo with his pondering of an uncertain relationship. Mac’s reputation for having an outlandish personality and artistry may be true, but the songs can hit home for any listener.
His vocal presence and songwriting continue to only get better with later tracks, such as “A Heart Like Hers,” which illustrates a somber tale of broken trust in a former romance’s heart, where he’d “Never believe in a heart like hers again.” DeMarco’s lyricism on this latest release is evidence of a trend to a more wholesome, mature production, without sacrificing the unique style that made hits like “Let Her Go” and “Ode to Viceroy.”
What Another One demonstrates that he has cultivated his talents with more refined instrumentals and lyrical exploration of love and love lost, on his best-articulated release thus far. DeMarco’s album ends with more introspect and retrospect on past love, on the drifting “Without Me,” followed by the final track, the instrumental “My House on the Water,” a calm track with keys overlaying the sounds of small waves hitting against the rocks. One can imagine the scene inspiring this last song would be no different than the location DeMarco is at on his faded album cover.
A simple-sounding album, DeMarco’s Another One really grows on the listener. This artist has developed yet another success here, with a refined lens on his signature style.

When the No. 19 USC football team (2-1, 0-1) made its somber return to the locker room after the 41-31 stunning loss to No. 21 Stanford (2-1, 1-0) Saturday, the key phrase floating around was third down conversion.
Both offenses entered the  Pac-12 opener at the bottom of the FBS barrel in finishing pivotal — drive prolonging plays: The Cardinal converting 30 percent of the time while the Trojans came in at a measly 25.
One of the teams, however, was able to flip the trend.
Stanford scored on seven of its nine possessions, moving the sticks eight of 12 times in a third down situation.
“We had [them] in situations that we wanted to be in. We got them into third down and just couldn’t get off the field,” said junior linebacker Su’a Cravens. “With an offense like that, when they’re physical and they keep converting third downs that turn into long drives, it’s hard to stop them.”
The defense also failed to shut down the Cardinal ground attack, giving up 195 yards to a team that had mustered up just 215 in its first two games of the season, including a career-high 120 to sophomore Christian McCaffrey.
“We lost the edge more than we should have against a team that runs to the edge,” said head coach Steve Sarkisian. “It was important for us to do that, to turn the ball back inside. That didn’t happen for us.”
Thrown out of rhythm by being sidelined for most of the game — Stanford had the ball for nearly 40 minutes of game action — USC’s offense failed to gain any traction and felt that because of the defense’s inability to get the Cardinal off the field, they were limited sufficiently.
“I think if you would have had them stopped a couple downs for us to get the ball back, you know, having our offense off the field slowed us down, threw us off our game,” said sophomore wide receiver Juju                                Smith-Schuster. “But when we were on the field we executed and made big plays.”
Armed primarily with key defensive takeaways from the Pac-12 opener, USC prepares to make its first road trip of the season, traveling to Tempe, Arizona, to battle Arizona State (2-1) Saturday.
A year removed from the infamous “Hail Mary” that gave the Sun Devils the 38-34 win at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in the schools’ last meeting, Sarkisian understands the importance of rebounding after a tough loss.
“We have to get back up. We have to go play a really quality opponent next week in Arizona State. We need to fix the things that need to be fixed,” Sarkisian said. “We need to come out and have a really good week of practice and get a quality win in the South division.”
ASU will have quarterback Mike Bercovici slinging passes under center, who played last year against USC as a replacement for injured Taylor Kelly and tallied five aerial touchdowns en route to a          510-yard performance.
The Trojan defense will need to work on its troubles of containing the edge over this week’s practices, as ASU wide receiver D.J. Foster is a weapon in both the air and ground game, just four receiving yards short of becoming the fourth player in NCAA history with 2,000 career rushing and receiving yards.
On the other side of the ball, USC redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler, the nation’s    third-most efficient passer, will have his toughest test of the young season against a stout ASU pass defense that is ninth in the nation in pass defense.
Early season losses are not foreign to the Trojans, who dropped their third game on the road to Boston College last season, and they are not ready to let the Stanford game affect the rest of their schedule.
“We had pressure before this loss so I don’t think any more pressure could be added to us,” said sophomore cornerback Adoree’ Jackson. “We just have to go out there and win.”

Every Wednesday, I always find time in my schedule to go to McCarthy Quad to visit the weekly Farmers Market. The Farmers Market was started to make it more convenient for students to shop for groceries; it features local farmers selling their fresh produce. Now that it has expanded, it is teeming with vendors selling a range of products, from artisan jewelry to delicious hotdogs and falafel. I’m here to give you my top three picks from the Farmers Market for those with a sweet tooth!
As I walked around the Farmers Market, one stall that stood out to me was “Bee Green Honey.” The stall was elegantly set up showcasing mouthwatering jars of golden honey. I talked to Louisa, who helps her parents run the Bee Green Honey business. She told me that their honey is locally pollinated and is 100 percent raw, unheated and unfiltered. This differs from the honey you buy in supermarkets, whose main ingredient is usually high fructose corn syrup.
Raw honey is packed with antioxidants and has multiple health benefits such as boosting your immune function and improving your digestive health. Raw honey can also be used for facials (time to have a honey facial sleepover), as a skin moisturizer and even as an acne remover! To top it all off, Bee Green Honey boasts three delicious, unique flavors — Raspberry Honey, Orange Blossom Honey and Alfalfa Honey. The Raspberry Honey is the sweetest among the bunch and the most popular among USC students, while the Orange Blossom Honey has more of a citrus tang.
My personal favorite is the Alfalfa Honey, which is lighter and milder in terms of sweetness, letting the honey flavor really shine through. Be sure to check out Bee Green Honey and to test free samples of these three flavors to see which is your favorite.

Sola Jams sells a range of homemade jams with unique flavors. As you near their stall, you will definitely smell the sweet perfume of their jams. Their top two best sellers are Cheeky Jalapeno Kiwi and Irresistible Strawberry. All of their products are made by Chef Sola in her home kitchen in Irvine.
They are made in small batches with fresh fruits and cane sugar so you don’t ever have to worry about any preservatives or additives. Sola Jams pride themselves in using real fresh fruit and each jar contains approximately one pound of fruit. Stop by to try samples of their notable flavors and buy your favorite to go with a slice of bread for a scrumptious and healthy breakfast!
Christina Nursalim | Daily Trojan
Honey Queen is a must. It features a variety of drinks made with organic fruits and sweetened with honey. There are more than ten different flavors, ranging from sweet, milky flavors like Taro and Thai Tea to more refreshing, tropical flavors like Sunset Paradise and Strawberry & Kiwi. They also have interesting, unusual flavors like Spice Rice, which has a milky cinnamon taste. My personal favorite is the Milk Tea.
The person who mans the stall already recognizes me because I never fail to stop by every Wednesday to get me through the summer heat. He’s super friendly and always asks me how I’m doing!
 His wife also has a stall in the Farmers Market right next to Honey Queen that sells fusion tacos if you want something savory to go with your drink. Free toppings like chia seeds and lychee jelly are also provided. The drink is $5 for a cup and if you keep your cup, you can get a refill for $4. Stop by to try out free samples and get free fortune cookies!

This coming Wednesday, be sure to make time in your schedule to head to USC’s Farmers Market and satisfy your sweet tooth. Take your time to look around, talk to the friendly vendors and to find some of your own Farmer’s Market favorites!

Dear Tiffany, 
So, I met this guy this summer when I was abroad, and we sort of had a fling. Halfway through, I realized he wasn’t the best dude. Handsome? Oh, yes. Boyfriend material? No. However, I still can’t get him out of my brain! I still find myself waiting for his text responses and stalking his Instagram every week. How do I get over this less-than-prince-charming? 
Sincerely, 
Infatuated and Confused
Dear Infatuated and Confused,
Sometimes you just can’t help yourself from thinking about someone who doesn’t deserve the brain capacity. Generally, I do not endorse drastic measures such as deleting exes from social media, but the time has come for you to start actively preventing yourself from checking his profiles. Recognize that he probably will not text you and that it’s for the best. If he does, keep it cordial, but be cautious of being sucked back into the vortex of his influence. Rip the bandaid off. Rip. It. Off.
Keep yourself busy with your life at USC, and maybe you’ll even meet a better dude serendipitously (if not, that’s OK too, Ms./Mr. Independent.) It’s a good first step that you know you want to get over this guy. Someday soon you will realize that you haven’t thought about him for weeks. Looking forward to that day for you.
Sincerely,
Tiffany

Nearly 30 percent of female undergraduate students at USC have experienced some form of sexual assault or misconduct since attending the University, according to respondent results from a university campus climate survey released Monday. 
The survey, which was administered last spring, drew responses from just over 8,000 students, or 19.4 percent of those enrolled in a USC degree program.
“It’s hard to draw any hard conclusions from a participation rate of 19 percent,” said Vice Provost of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry in a press briefing Monday morning. “We will take the responses that we have and do the best job we can with the data in front of us.”
USC’s survey was part of a larger organizing effort by the Association of American Universities to administer sexual assault climate surveys to 27 colleges across the country. Of the 21 schools that have released individual data, USC, along with the University of Michigan, had the highest percentage of sexual assault among undergraduate women
On other data points, the University numbers were in line with the AAU’s survey national averages released Monday, Carry said, though he thought the averages were still too high. 
“What I cannot emphasize enough is one incident of sexual assault on our campus is too much,” he said. “We have got to end this.”
The forms of sexual misconduct covered in the survey were nonconsensual penetration and nonconsensual sexual touching. In the last school year, 17.3 percent of female undergraduates said they had experienced some form of this misconduct. 
Instances involving female undergraduates were considerably greater than male undergraduates, with 6.8 percent male respondents reporting an instance of sexual misconduct since entering USC, and 4 percent reporting an instance within the past year. 
There was also a large disparity between graduate and undergraduate students, with 4.2 percent of female graduate students reporting either nonconsensual penetration or nonconsensual sexual touching. 
Alcohol was a prevailing factor in the majority of the cases, an issue Carry said may necessitate expanding outreach programs on the substance’s effects.  
“We found with the majority students involved in nonconsensual penetration, alcohol was involved in one or both parties,” he said. “So we have to ramp up our education on alcohol consumption.” 
In response to the Monday’s survey results, the University will be holding open conversations and forums with the USC community in the coming weeks to discuss the data and what can be done to further alleviate the frequency of sexual assault and misconduct. 
The school is also looking into implementing mandatory sexual assault education for all grade levels, as well as rolling out bystander education courses. The survey showed that 75.7 percent of those who said they were a bystander to sexual assault or misconduct did nothing.  
The above measures are meant to build off a string of changes rolled out over the past two years working to revamp USC’s sexual assault-related programming and procedures. 
These changes include the University expanding and relocating the Center for Women and Men to the Engemann Student Health Center, implementing an amnesty policy for those who report or witness sexual misconduct under the influence of alcohol and hiring a full time Title IX investigator who solely investigates cases of sexual misconduct at USC.
In light of the survey, some students said it was indicative that more work needs to be done to reduce the frequency of incidents. 
“It either means that we have a problem or it means that the problem has existed for a long time and it’s just that people are speaking more against it now,” said Harry Lam, a sophomore majoring in business administration, regarding the data.
Accessibility to reporting cases of sexual assault is also an problem, said Shyann Murphy, executive director of the Women’s Student Assembly. She said students need to more privy to a reporting process that is shrouded in “legalese.” 
“In order to increase reporting rates, every student needs to know what sexual misconduct is and be familiar with the whole process,” she said. “Those are a lot of shame that come along with reporting and admitting you’ve been a victim of sexual assault.”
With the survey data, Murphy said now is a great jumping off point to move forward in sexual assault prevention. 
“I’m glad that USC did the survey because now that they have it proven there’s an actual issue, we can look at different avenues in providing resources and changing campus culture,” she said.
