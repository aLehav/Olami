On Monday nights at Nature’s Brew, a coffee shop just north of campus, students can order their usual coffee and croissant with a side of stand-up comedy. 
Co-hosted by Tatiana Aarons, a junior majoring in media arts and practice, and Madeleine Hamilton,  a junior majoring in business administration, Charity Night treats audiences to a show put on by a variety of comedians from the Los Angeles area. Nature’s Brew, a casual study spot for many students looking to escape the confines of the library, welcomes the production as a unique complement to guests’ dining experiences. 
The program happens every three weeks, adding up to five shows in total by the end of the semester. During each 90-minute show, Aarons and Hamilton introduce approximately six guest comedians, who each perform a 10- to 12-minute long set. 
The show was created five years ago by two aspiring stand-up comedians under a different name, “Prom Night.” Two years later, the title was changed to “Ballers” before being handed off to the current co-hosts. Charity Night, like its predecessors, was named to create humorous themes for each of the events — most recently, Aarons and Hamilton co-hosted “Charity Night for Middle Children.” Because the production revamps its style with every new host, Charity Night — which has put on only two shows in total — is in the process of creating its own identity in the stand-up world.
“We’re still starting out,” Aarons said. “All the shows, because they’re renamed, have a building-up period. It’s a matter of getting the word out.”
Contrary to what its name suggests, Charity Night does not donate any profits to community foundations. In fact, the show does not make any profit at all. 
But that does not mean Charity Night refuses to serve the community. In addition to providing audience members with a humorous break from the anxieties of school life, Aarons and Hamilton reach out to students interested in stand-up by giving them the opportunity to perform themselves. 
“Charity Night is an opportunity for students to take time out of their weeks to laugh and maybe meet a comedian or two,” Aarons said. “[Charity Night] is important to me because I get to enable professional comedians to do what they love, and I get to enable USC students both to participate in stand-up and to watch it.”
These newcomers can also hone their skills by learning from the best. In the past, Nature’s Brew has seen comedians who have also been hosted by television hosts Conan O’Brien and Stephen Colbert. Most notably, former Girl Code comedian Nicole Byer and Comedy Central writer Matt Ingebretson have graced the stand-up stage. 
Putting both these components together, however, is not as simple as it appears. As hosts, Aarons and Hamilton often struggle to satisfy the audience while dealing with the unpredictability of a live show.
“Comedians are unreliable — we’ve had some come out 10 minutes before the show ends and do their sets,” Aarons said. “There’s also the stress factor of getting people out. We’ve been lucky the past two times, but it is a lot to ask for people to come [to the show] on Monday nights.” 
For those looking to break into the industry, Charity Night is a rare chance to train in an underappreciated art. The stand-up comedy show, a positive and lighthearted addition to the community, is not as prevalent as it should be, in Aarons’ opinion.
“Anyone who’s an aspiring stand-up knows that open-mics aren’t very lucrative,” Aarons said. “They’re often in dingy bars at 6 p.m. with three other comics who are in their 50s, just out of jail. I thought [Charity Night] was a huge opportunity for me to meet people in the industry and constantly have a platform to practice what I like doing.”
Charity Night’s next three events will take place on Oct. 23, Nov. 13 and Dec. 4.

Four bands. Twelve songs. One midterm. On Wednesday night, USC Thornton School of Music’s freshman class performed its first showcase, a live event featuring performances of pop songs from the 1950s and 1960s. For the performers, the recital doubled as a midterm assessment for their pop music class. For the audience, the concert was a display of the talent that Thornton consistently produces. 
At 8 p.m., professor and popular music program chair Patrice Rushen introduced the show. Rushen expressed her excitement regarding the student performances. She explained that the show is split into four sets from bands consisting of Thornton students in a pop music class. She did caution that as this was a midterm, some bands might be playing the same songs, but that did not take away from the show’s excitement. 
The first band opened the show with Ben E. King’s classic “Stand by Me,” a fitting welcome to the world of ’60s pop music. The influences in modern pop music remain intact, but the students brought a fresh, new energy to the music by infusing it with their personal flair. The first group closed its four-song set with a riveting performance of “Hit the Road Jack,” featuring a solo from songwriting student Cole Mitchell. 
“[The show consists of] ’50s and ’60s classics, so it’s a great way to learn the traditions of pop that current music is built off of,” Mitchell said.
Next, the second group started with an encore performance of Sam Cooke’s “What A Wonderful World.” This time around, soloist Noa Zimmerman, a freshman majoring in songwriting, took the spotlight. Zimmerman expressed her excitement about the program before the performance began.
“The class is a great way to get to know people as a freshman,” Zimmerman said. “You get to meet people from different backgrounds.” 
Zimmerman was one of many students who exhibited versatility, as she switched to playing guitar for the remaining songs after her vocal solo. 
In fact, each group brought a distinctive and different energy to the same songs, proving that pop music’s flexibility and ability to produce different performance styles. 
The final two bands thrilled with their performances, including highlights such as Elvis Presley’s “You Ain’t Nothin’ But a Hound Dog” and Chuck Berry’s infamous “Johnny B. Goode.” Those who performed earlier could be seen in the crowd supporting their peers’ performances. 
Although the Thornton Pop Music Showcase was technically an assessment, the student performers’ enjoyment and passion for the music became obvious once they approached the stage. 
The Thornton School is a true gem.

The transition from September to October marks a great shift in our everyday lives — sweaters are thrown on despite the 85 degree temperatures; pumpkin-flavored treats return to  every eatery; and, most importantly, Los Angeles’ scariest haunts are open for business once again. Though Knott’s Berry Farm’s haunted house and Universal Studios Hollywood’s Halloween Horror Nights tend to be the most popular options, there are many other haunted attractions around the city to check out. 
The Backwoods Maze
For those on a budget, there a few free haunted houses available. The first is The Backwoods Maze, located in Burbank. The house is maintained by a family who annually transform their backyard into a giant maze. Though it is free, donations are accepted and all proceeds go to a local charity. It has an impressive five-star Yelp review, with visitors describing it as one of the best haunted houses in the area. The Maze debuts Friday and will remain open every weekend until Oct. 31 from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.
Haunted Hayride
There are also many options for those willing to shell out a little more for the full adrenaline pumping experience. The Los Angeles Haunted Hayride in Griffith Park is one of the most popular haunted attractions, located about 10 miles from USC. There are four different “scare zones”; the first is the House of Shadows, a fully dark maze. The next is Purgatory, which has a carnival set up with rides, themed food and drink, a psychic and other activities. Trick or Treat is an interactive maze set up like a neighborhood. Visitors go from door to door to see if they will receive a treat or something far worse. Finally, as the name implies, there is the infamous Haunted Hayride. Visitors will start on a hayride and and eventually go through a corn maze full of clowns on their own. Tickets start at $35 and it the attraction runs every Thursday through Sunday until Halloween. 
The Haunted Shack
Another affordable option is The Haunted Shack, also a family-owned seasonal attraction.  The Shack is in Torrance and featuring a maze that takes six to eight minutes to complete. The maze is completely different every year, enticing people to return for two decades. This year, The Haunted Shack will run on Oct. 28 and 31 from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Similar to the Backwoods Maze, donations are accepted and will go to the Susan G. Komen foundation.
CreepLA: Lore
Downtown Los Angeles houses CreepLA: Lore, a uniquely informative experience. Lore is based on the identically titled Amazon Prime show and explores the real-life stories behind the popular myths and legends heard today, including those of vampires, possessed dolls and werewolves. The experience is an interactive and engaging one-hour, eight-person tour full of “moody rooms, intimate encounters and terrifying scenarios,” according to CreepLA’s website. CreepLA will screen Lore Thursdays to Sundays until Nov. 12 and tickets are $70.
Dark Harbor
The Queen Mary, docked in Long Beach, has an annual Halloween show, Dark Harbor. The ship is rumored to be haunted by its namesake and has six mazes scattered throughout different parts of the ship. Monsters including Scary Mary, Samuel the Savage and the Voodoo Priestess could be around any corner, along with various other scares. Beyond the mazes, Dark Harbor features live entertainment and a 4-D theater experience. Tickets are available for every day of the week until Nov. 1, starting at $20. 
Los Angeles is full of Halloween attractions for thrill-seekers of all ages. October will be gone before you know it, so be sure to let clowns, ghosts and goblins scare you to your heart’s content before the season is over.

Scandals involving influential producer Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of sexually harassing and assaulting a number of women, have rocked Hollywood over the course of this week. One particularly disturbing, yet unsurprising aspect of The New York Times and The New Yorker reports was that beloved male actors like Ben Affleck and Matt Damon — whose careers were advanced by Weinstein — claimed no prior knowledge of his inappropriate behavior. Put simply, the report was a reminder of the consequences of underrepresentation and male-dominated fields and environments.
During this week, USC students were also exposed to two damning reports about sexual harassment from two administrators — Rohit Varma, the now-former dean of the Keck School of Medicine, and David Carrera, USC’s vice president of advancement and health sciences development. According to the Los Angeles Times report the University had launched an internal investigation into Varma following a complaint from a female colleague, leading to “USC formally [disciplining] the dean, Dr. Rohit Varma, in 2003 following allegations that he sexually harassed the young researcher while he was a junior professor supervising her work.”
By no means does the phenomenon of men like Weinstein who seem to feel empowered by their stronger numbers to either A) abuse women or B) look the other way as men they work with abuse women, exist exclusively in the entertainment industry. As incidents at USC — where academic faculty and senior administration are starkly male-dominated — demonstrate, this is also an issue in academia. In politics and government, in American offices across the country, society collectively has a “boys’ club” problem. And while this is an issue that disproportionately and vastly affects women, from determining the way we’re treated to the opportunities we receive, it cannot be our burden to fix it.
On Monday, actress and producer Mindy Kaling tweeted, “Why is it helpful men speak up? that’s what this personality fears most: the disintegration of the tacit male support for this behavior.”
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
In an ideal world, perhaps we’d trust and respect women enough to believe and support them when they come forward. We wouldn’t need initiatives like United Nations ambassador Emma Watson’s #HeForShe campaign, and feminists wouldn’t need validation and approval from men in order to affect change and improve women’s living standards. But the fact that complaints like those made against Weinstein, Varma and Carrera illustrate that this is not an ideal world. We need men to speak up because, as Kaling points out, the dark and simple truth is that until they do, the male sexual predators they work with could very well assume that they are allies.
That is the nature of boys’ clubs — they are environments where men are the majority and therefore, having grown up with their every misdeed being dismissed with the line “boys will be boys,” they, as men, will be men.
When it comes to Weinstein, the issue at hand is greater than just one man. The mega-star producer was able to leverage not only his wealth and influence but also, ultimately, his popularity within Hollywood’s decades-old boys’ club as a shield for decades.
In 2016, of the top 100 highest grossing films, women made up just 4 percent of directors, 11 percent of writers and 3 percent of cinematographers. At USC, only 15.1 percent of tenured STEM faculty are female, leaving the other 84.9 percent male. What we have on our hands is a systemic issue that is ultimately two-pronged. In the long run, we need more women in positions of power to combat the male dominance that enables a culture of disrespect and harassment of women to exist. But right now, what we need the most is men who are willing to speak up and identify themselves as allies of women, as active opponents of misogyny, rather than mere bystanders.
At USC and in the entertainment industry, we need immediate action and proactive leadership. It should not take damning reports in The New York Times or Los Angeles Times, and years and years after the fact, at that, to spur action. We cannot allow boys’ clubs and their beneficiaries to sweep women and their experiences under the rug. But why stop there, really? In 2017, no longer should we allow boys’ clubs and their shocking toxicity to exist at all.

CORRECTION: An earlier version of this column included statements that mischaracterized the details of Rohit Varma’s behavior and the chain of events that led to his departure. It has also been updated to clarify that allegations of willful misbehavior by Weinstein, Affleck and others have been disputed by them and their representatives.
The Daily Trojan regrets the errors.

On Tuesday, following startling reports that multi-millionaire Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein had sexually harassed and assaulted women for years, USC announced that it would decline a gift of $5 million from Weinstein. Weinstein had pledged $5 million to female filmmakers at USC’s School of Cinematic Arts in a public statement apologizing for his actions.
“In light of the admitted behavior by Mr. Weinstein and the subsequent reports there is no way the school would move forward,” SCA spokeswoman Kristin Borella told NBC4.
USC’s decision to reject Weinstein’s donation comes as the University treads through the fallout from its own sexual harassment scandals. On Wednesday, a Los Angeles Times report revealed that Vice President for Advancement and Health Sciences Development David Carrera was being investigated for sexual harassment. According to the Times, USC received five complaints about Carrera’s behavior over the course of his three-year tenure, during which Carrera raised millions for the University.
Last week, another Times report revealed the University had promoted and given a pay raise to former Keck School of Medicine Dean Rohit Varma after disciplining him following allegations of sexual harassment from a female researcher in 2003. The allegation against Varma was particularly alarming because, like allegations against Weinstein, it spanned back years, but was seemingly buried by people in positions of power until being made public by the media.
By rejecting Weinstein’s donation, USC has demonstrated its interest in moving past sexual harassment scandals and toward greater transparency. The University has its work cut out for it, namely in taking a more proactive approach in addressing misconduct among faculty rather than waiting for large-scale reports come out before taking effective action. But in rejecting Weinstein’s funding, USC is stating its understanding of the gravity of sexual harassment, and its intention to do better moving forward.
USC’s decision regarding Weinstein must be a first step, and mark the beginning of a new chapter for the University — one in which it will not foster relationships with those who disrespect women and seek to abuse their power, no matter how much funding the University may get in exchange. USC’s dismissiveness of sexual abuse, detailed in the Times’ reports over the last week, is helping foster a culture in which USC’s female faculty and student body are devalued and made to feel unsafe and disrespected. This is a culture that the University must do everything in its power to shift, or it could lose out on future female talent.
Declining Weinstein’s money sends a strong message, but the Trojan Family needs more than words right now — we need actions from the University to once and for all dispel a reputation and culture of sexual misconduct and disrespect toward women. Currently, male tenured faculty outnumber female tenured faculty at the University by a ratio of 74 to 26 percent, establishing a male-dominated campus culture that has helped to breed the abuse of women and and led to actions that many people would view as an attempt to cover up abuse. Even more startling is that, of USC’s 11 senior administrators, only two are women. Wider representation of women in positions of power is the first step in dismantling a broader culture at USC in which continued harassment can exist.
Provost Michael Quick came out strongly in support of the USC Title IX Office’s policies on Sept. 8, and stood in defense of female students who have been victims of sexual abuse — a move we applaud. But it is simply not enough, especially in the face of the recent allegations, for senior administrators to pledge to support female students who have been sexually abused, while allowing a culture of sexual harassment involving their own colleagues in the Bovard Administration Building to continue. Only in the face of an onslaught of Times reporting did Varma and Carrera vacate their senior leadership roles. In fact, Varma is still listed as a tenured faculty member on the Keck website.
In both Carrera’s and Weinstein’s cases, the problem is not that victims are not coming forward — the Times reported that Carrera had as many as five complaints against him and Varma had one. It is that USC knew of the reports and did not address the deeper, institutional problems behind them. The problems were documented; the University just did not choose to take them seriously. It should not take a Times investigation for USC to take action.
There should be no tolerance for sexual harassment at USC — by either students or staff. Men in positions of power — whether it be at USC, Hollywood or Washington, D.C. — need to be held accountable for the way they treat female colleagues. It should be USC, not the Los Angeles Times, that holds them accountable. Furthermore, refusing Weinstein’s $5 million pledge means nothing if the University is simultaneously benefiting from the $6 billion fundraising effort that Carrera helped lead while being accused of harassment, or the lucrative fundraising Varma brought to the University.
Either USC stands in opposition to all forms of sexual harassment and those who commit it, or it enables a pervasive culture in which women’s rights to be treated as an equal in the workplace are subjugated by a push to fundraise. USC’s endowment can wait, but women at USC cannot.

Editor’s note: This article has been updated to clarify the details of the recent sexual harassment allegations that have been made public and the events following them.
Will your harassment board also fight against the injustices perpetrated by the alt-Left media, antifa, BLM, BAMN, BEI groups and the like against conservatives?  Or is this a one sided affair?

Lily Vaughan | Daily Trojan
When Harvey Weinstein’s revolting behavior became public — when female actors stepped forward en masse to lament that they, too, had been subjects of Weinstein’s abuse, and producers and industry agents denounced and dropped him in droves, when he lost his job, lost friends, lost his marriage (all rightfully so) — all the GOP thought to do was point the finger. What say you, Hillary, whom we have told dozens of times to get off the stage, and yet from whom we still expect specific denunciations of all things evil? What say you, liberal Hollywood, now that accusations stand against a Democrat? As the one-year anniversary of the Access Hollywood tape came and went last week, these brazen declarations grow ever the more ironic.
All of this screaming and shaming from a party that elevated a confessed sexual predator to the highest office in the land. If Trump’s myriad sexual assaults — some of which are admitted on tape, or to The Apprentice producers who heard about his sexual misconduct involving minors — were simply “locker room” behavior, why, then, is Harvey Weinstein’s “industry couch” not the same to them? The answer, of course, is that it is. The GOP is not trying to make the point that liberals do not care about women — it is to try to make the case that liberals also do not care about women. They are trying to establish that everyone does it — and therefore, we can all now stop treating it as though it’s some big problem. Admit that you do it, the GOP seems to beg — admit that you do it too, that we all do it, so that we can stop pretending to care. Let me put it to you this way: the GOP response was so quintessentially GOP. 
What Harvey Weinstein did was both absolutely inexcusable and just plain horrifying. But what the ruling party did in return — unable to simply, respectfully, humbly state that they denounce his actions and stand by women in the workplace — not only showcases their gross immaturity but also their classic inability to self-reflect, accidentally and idiotically spotlighting not only their tacit acceptance of sexual assault (as long as none of us are going to be hypocrites about it), but also their hateful, white-knuckled grasp on instigative behavior and pettiness. 
In another sense, false equivalencies somehow always find their way into conversations around sexual assault. For instance, when the University recently passed deferred rush, the Interfraternity Council indignantly claimed that the University was treating student organizations unequally — if students could join other clubs in the fall but not Greek letter organizations, they were, therefore, dearly oppressed. Please, IFC, let me know when Chess Club develops a decades-long sexual assault problem. In the same vein, the GOP petulantly asked what the liberal response would be to a Democratic abuser — expecting, I assume, to use a non-reaction from Hollywood as a leg-up to their own predator president. 
Instead, Weinstein lost his company, his connections, the credibility of his work, his wife, the respect of his family and friends and any prestige or power that might once have been associated with his name. It took too long for Hollywood to speak out. I would never contest that. But once they did, the industry shut the gates on him. But our president? Barely un-endorsed, quickly re-endorsed, party-funded, one spineless congressional Republican after another pledging their fealty — because of the mass of the base he commanded, and the swaths of their constituencies he therefore controlled. 
What did Vice President Mike Pence — a man who cannot sit at the same table as a female senator without his wife present — do when the Access Hollywood tape leaked? Nothing. What did former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus or Sen. Mitch McConnell say, both self-selected “defenders” of a more moral, more wholesome culture? What did Donald Trump Jr. — at least a father of daughters, if not enough of a decent human being to care on the basis of his own common humanity — have to say? None of these men who recently jumped out of the woodwork to prematurely point and say “Gotcha!” did anything when one of their own outed himself as a happy terrorizer of women. 
Perhaps it’s an overstated point, but we don’t seem to remember it nearly enough — the party that pretends to emphasize some old American “morality” will throw that away as soon as they sense their own interests have been compromised. As that same sexual abuser now seeks to dismantle health care via executive order, and as national backlash mounts, let us expect nothing more from them than the usual childlike dysfunction and manic tantrums. 
Lily Vaughan is a junior majoring in history and political science. Her column,“Playing Politics,” runs Fridays.
Now I understand.  Everything is the republican’s fault.  When friends of the Obamas and Clintons regularly assaults women it is the republican’s fault.  
The logic of the Left…an oxymoron if I ever heard one.
Ahyes…. another dumb slit vying with Kylie for ignorant s lut of the campus.
What about a “caring tone” for the victims? I think this man’s actions are sick and depraved. Excuses?
Lily Vaughan is correct. Weinstein’s unspeakable acts were vile, unforgiveable, repulsive. The acts of a man who achieved great power and misused it for evil to harm women. Got it. The rest of her essay falsely equates the rotten Weinstein with the Republican Party. Weinstein was a fiercely loyal Democrat, donating millions to his party. He had no connection to the Republican Party at all. And no, the Democratic Party should bear no blame for Weinstein, either. They did not motivate Weinstein or fail in any way that bears on Weinstein. 
Ms. Vaughan cites the nasty behavior of President Trump. Got it. But that does not justify Weinstein’s actions, nor did the Republican Party claim that it did. She is also angry that current and past Republican Party officials failed to condemn Weinstein. OK. But a vast amount of high Democratic Party officials failed in the same way.
The article is fair in its condemnation of Harvey Weinstein, a powerful, wealthy man who used his great power to abuse women. Loathesome and evil. But to conflate his foul behavior with his Democratic Party, or the Republican Party, is nonsense. Blame Weinstein, or perhaps his parents, if you like. But don’t blame either political party. They had nothing to do with his atrocious acts.

On Sept. 23, 2016, it appeared as though USC’s season ended on a rainy Friday night in Salt Lake City. Utah defeated USC 31-27 on a touchdown with 18 seconds left in the game, and a then-redshirt freshman quarterback named Sam Darnold saw his debut spoiled in heart-wrenching fashion. 
The Trojans fell to 1-3. But it wasn’t close to the end. It was a new beginning. 
“I just remember in that game just seeing our team grow,” head coach Clay Helton said. “It reminds me a little of this year. I saw players getting better week in and week out … Instead of worrying about what’s out there way on down the line, just worry about what it takes to win this week and let’s add them all up at the end.” 
Last year’s loss to Utah was a turning point for a team standing at the crossroads. Now, one year and some change later, the Trojans again face the Utes at a critical point in their season. They suffered their first loss of the season to the Cougars on the road two weeks ago, and now must win out to get a whiff at the College Football Playoff facing a stiff test in Utah this weekend. 
For Darnold, Utah is the only school he has unfinished business with from last year as they represent just one of two losses he’s suffered in 16 career starts. When he played Utah, the now-redshirt sophomore entered the game as a virtual unknown, benched in favor of Max Browne at the start of the season. Since his first career start at Rice-Eccles Stadium, Darnold has been featured on Sports Illustrated covers and NFL Draft forecasts. With all eyes on him in 2017, the results have been mixed. He’s already tied his total number of interceptions last year (nine) in just six games. 
“I’d like to beat Utah just because I haven’t before,” Darnold said. “And Coach Whittingham, I have so much respect for him. It’s well-documented that they were my first offer, so I have a lot of respect for the Utah program because of what they’ve built there ever since they entered the Pac-12.”
In Darnold’s emotional rematch with the Utes at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, he must go up against a stout front seven and a secondary with a knack for forcing turnovers. The Utes’ defense has allowed the second fewest total touchdowns (nine) and has forced the second most turnovers (five fumbles, nine interceptions) in the Pac-12. Senior linebackers Sunia Tauteoli (7.5 tackles for loss) and Kavika Laufatasaga (26 tackles) both can fly to the football and blow up plays in the backfield. Utah also possesses a dominant defensive line behind tackles Lowell Lotulelei and Filipo Mokofisi. 
“They load the box,” Helton said. “This is a cover-one football team, cover-three football team. They’re going to put one more down there than you have. They do a tremendous job with their big people up front … Their primary focus is to stop the run and they put their DBs on islands and so far they’ve held up extremely well.”
For the Utah offense, Los Angeles native Troy Williams has reclaimed the starting quarterback spot he held last year, after Tyler Huntley went down with an injury two weeks ago. Williams is a dual threat; last year he totaled 20 touchdowns both through the air and on the ground. 
He will be throwing to wide receiver Darren Carrington II, who leads the Pac-12 in receiving yards (116.8 yards per game, five touchdowns). Likely the most dynamic athlete on Utah’s roster, Carrington joined the team this season after spending the last three years as a standout for Oregon. Upon his dismissal from the program due to a DUI arrest, the San Diego native is making the most of second chance in the Pac-12 South. 
Clashing with Carrington, Williams and Zack Moss, the Utes’ leading running back, will be a Trojan defense prolific in its own right. In replacing junior linebacker Porter Gustin, sophomore defensive end Christian Rector has emerged as the unit’s primary disrupter. He leads the Pac-12 with 4.5 sacks and two fumble recoveries. In addition to the defensive front, USC’s secondary is tied for forcing the most interceptions in the conference with nine. Sophomore cornerback Jack Jones has four interceptions himself over the first half of the season. 
As Darnold tilts with Utah for the second time in his career, his supporting cast may look different, but the game’s importance remains the same heading into a Pac-12 contest with major Pac-12 South division ramifications. 
“I think everyone on the team knows what’s going down on Saturday,” Darnold said. “We know implications that the game presents. So far, on film, we’ve seen them bring it. We’re going to be ready, but it definitely will be a battle for sure.”

“They don’t take us seriously.”
Senior captain Chris Hawkins shook his head as he stood outside of the locker room after USC’s victory over Oregon State last Saturday. 
His team had just won 38-10 in a cakewalk of a game over the Beavers. But Hawkins wasn’t satisfied. He repeated that his team needed to improve, that there was still much to work on, that they weren’t playing their best. 
Why, after a win, was he dissatisfied? Hawkins said it was simple. The rest of the NCAA still doesn’t think USC is for real. Despite only taking one loss — to a top 20 team on the road, no less — the Trojans remain outside the top 10. 
After a less-than-perfect start to the season, they’ve been written off for the playoffs and even for some bowl games.
Hawkins already has an answer to the snub.
“We gotta start dominating teams,” Hawkins said. “It seems like the college football world takes us lightly, no matter if we win by a little or a lot. So we just gotta start dominating teams.”
Hawkins smirked as he said it. He wants to go old-school — 50-0 blowouts at home and on the road, just like what USC liked to hand out in the ‘80s and ‘90s. He wants his team to guarantee that an offense won’t score before it even steps on the field.
The Trojans are known for being hard on themselves, and nowhere is that more true than the defense. Junior linebacker and captain Cam Smith has a catchphrase, and it stuck to this year’s unit throughout this bumpy season.
“Keep it up here,” Smith will roar to his teammates on the field, raising his hand in a chopping motion by his right ear. “Right up here. Keep it up here.”
The defense echoes the phrase after every play. Good or bad, stop or first down, interception or reception, the players chop at the air with one hand. Keep it up here, they’ll yell. Keep it up here. The mantra has come to define the way the team wants to approach each snap.
“We know our standards and how we want to play,” sophomore cornerback Jack Jones said. “We have to play up here, we have to keep it coming. No matter the situation, we gotta play hard and give it our all.”
Smith has good reason to enter Saturday’s game with high expectations for both the team and himself. He found his rhythm against Utah at home as a freshman, when he was catapulted from relatively unknown status as a freshman to a cross-campus star after snagging three interceptions. 
Since that game, Smith has risen to become a team captain and defensive leader. He currently leads the team with 19 solo tackles and 46 total, adding a sack to combine for 28 total yards of loss. 
As a middle linebacker, Smith is the heart of the defense, noticing all of the team’s successes and flaws. Defense is a difficult position, he says, because even one mistimed tackle or flubbed coverage can result in a touchdown. The offense only has to get it right every other time. But for the defense, perfection is demanded and expected. 
Although the team has been smothering this season, it has still allowed an average of 24 points per game. After holding Oregon State to 10 points, Smith and the rest of the defense plans on dropping that number to zero for the rest of the season.
Raising the team’s level of play to this level will take work at every position. And that consistency will be key, Smith says, to the defense becoming truly dominant. 
“I think as a defense, and I can only speak for the defense, I think we’re playing great ball right now,” Smith said. “We’re just not playing four quarters yet.”

Fresh off of their trip to the desert, the No. 19 women’s volleyball team (13-4, 5-1 Pac-12) is back in the Galen Center this week to host Cal (11-6, 2-4) on Friday and No. 3 Stanford (13-2, 6-0) on Sunday. 
Arizona swept USC last Friday, handing the Trojans their first Pac-12 conference loss and snapping their five-game winning streak — but USC bounced back to beat Arizona State in four sets. The Trojans will return to the Galen Center, where they own an undefeated 5-0 record on home court this season, for this week’s games.
“The good thing is we’ve been pretty good at home, in every one of the matches we played here at home this year, and so I’m hoping that they’ll do the same thing getting ready for Cal on Friday night,” head coach Mick Haley said. “That’s a big one: We gotta play Cal first, and if we can beat Cal on Friday night, then we’ll worry about Stanford on Sunday. But Cal is the big focus right now.”
The Women of Troy will once again lean on a balanced offense spearheaded by senior opposite hitter Brittany Abercrombie. While the team struggled against the Wildcats, the Trojans regained their offensive composure against the Sun Devils, where four players recorded double-digit kills for USC, led by Abercrombie’s team-high 18 kills. 
The team also received a boost from senior opposite hitter Niki Withers, sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier, sophomore opposite hitter Daley Krage and senior middle blocker Danielle Geiger, who combined for 43 kills against Arizona State. Senior setter Reni Mayer-Whalley and sophomore setter Cindy Marina look to assist the team in setting up attacking opportunities. Expect the offense to revolve around an equal distribution of attacking opportunities much like it did against Arizona State. 
The Golden Bears are led by a trio of offensive threats. Senior outside hitter Antzela Dempi has 2.89 kills per set with 179 total kills, junior outside hitter Carmen Annevelink has 2.53 kills per set and 157 kills while freshman outside hitter Mima Mirkovic sports 2.63 kills per set with 163 total kills. 
The Golden Bears are looking to bounce back against USC after suffering two straight sweeps against Oregon and Oregon State. However, the odds are stacked against them, as they are 2-4 against Pac-12 opponents and are only 1-5 on the road this season, whereas USC has a perfect 5-0 home record this season and owns a 144-30 all-time record in the Galen Center.
After a day’s break, the Women of Troy will be back in the Galen Center to face off against Pac-12 volleyball giant No. 3 Stanford. The Trojan defense has to prepare adequately against sophomore outside hitter Kathryn Plummer, who is averaging an astonishing 4.76 kills per set and has accumulated a total of 238 kills. 
Plummer’s kills per set rank 9th in Division I women’s volleyball. She is supported by sophomore middle blocker Audriana Fitzmorris and redshirt senior opposite hitter Merete Lutz, who are averaging 2.20 and 2.76 kills per set, respectively. 
Other notable offensive threats from the Cardinal include redshirt freshman outside hitter Michaela Keefe (1.91 kills per set), freshman outside hitter Meghan McClure (1.80 kills per set) and junior middle blocker Tami Alade (1.72 kills per set). The offensive firepower from Stanford will be key to setting the tone for the game. The Cardinal’s defense is anchored by Fitzmorris and Alade, who average 1.44 and 1.48 blocks per set, respectively, and will prove to be a tough challenge for the Trojans’ offense. The Women of Troy will have a monumental task in trying to contain the visiting No. 3 Cardinal. 
“October is always the hardest month for us to compete, so I’m hoping that what we learned in the past will help us through this, and I’m hoping we can come up with a couple of wins this weekend,” Haley said.
The Trojans have had their fair share of tough challenges from several other opponents, but Sunday’s game against No. 3 Stanford will be one of the biggest games of the season. The Women of Troy will host the Golden Bears at 7 p.m. Friday and the Cardinal at 3 p.m. on Sunday.

The Pac-12 announced on Thursday that it would create a new task force aimed at solving issues surrounding the recruitment of college athletes.
“We believe strongly in the educational mission of college sports and its positive impact on student-athletes,” Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said in a press release. “We are committed to taking the concrete action … to combat threats to the integrity of college athletics, and to both protecting our student-athletes and ensuring fair competition for the athletic programs in which they participate.”
The announcement came one day after the NCAA created the Commission on College Basketball, which aims to fix nationwide corruption in college basketball recruiting that was revealed by an FBI investigation in September. The Pac-12 task force aims to address the issues that have been raised in multiple Pac-12 men’s basketball programs as part of a nationwide investigation by the FBI. 
Scott said that the conference is working to stay ahead of these issues, especially involving recruitment, in hopes of preventing them before they happen. He cited concerns with third parties — such as the agents who allegedly offered money to suspended USC associate head coach Tony Bland in exchange for influence over athletes — as a major focus of the task force.
The task force will be comprise a wide range of people, including coaches, athletic administrators, student-athletes and members of commercial entities such as athletic agencies ,who are involved in recruitment. The conference has already named athletic directors Dan Guerrero and Chris Hill, former basketball coach Mike Montgomery, former football player Charles Davis and administrator Tom Jernstedt to the task force.
The conference also announced four areas that will be investigated by the task force — education and issues identification; best practices and Pac-12 policy recommendations; system reform recommendations; and application of learnings to recruitment in sports beyond basketball.
At the end of the first quarter of 2018, the task force will present its findings and suggestions to the conference. The conference and the NCAA will use this report to attempt to fix internal issues throughout the Pac-12.
