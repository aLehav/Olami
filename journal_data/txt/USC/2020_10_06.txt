Redshirt junior offensive lineman Alijah Vera-Tucker announced Tuesday via social media he is opting back into the 2020 season.
Vera-Tucker had initially announced his intention to opt out of a potential spring football season Sept. 9 to declare and prepare for the NFL Draft. 
But on Sept. 24, the Pac-12 CEO Group unanimously voted to carry out a fall football schedule. USC is set to begin its season Nov. 7 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum against Arizona State, — and Vera-Tucker will be there. 
“The recent announcement that USC is able to play this season has allowed me to reevaluate my situation,” Vera-Tucker said in a video posted to his Twitter and Instagram. “The opportunity to rejoin my teammates, represent the Trojan Family, continue to advance toward my degree and compete for a Pac-12 Championship this season is something I could not pass up.”
Vera-Tucker played left guard for USC in 2019, starting all of the team’s 13 games. He was selected to the All-Pac-12 Second Team and AP All-Pac-12 First Team, winning USC’s Offensive Lineman of the Year Award. 
Former Trojan offensive tackle Austin Jackson departed after the 2019 season for the NFL Draft, and Vera-Tucker is a candidate to replace him at the vital position of left tackle to anchor the offensive line and protect sophomore quarterback Kedon Slovis, who had reached out to Vera-Tucker about the possibility of opting back in.
Pro Football Focus, an NFL Draft analysis outlet, graded Vera-Tucker as the top run-blocking guard in the Pac-12 in 2019. According to PFF, Vera-Tucker allowed pressure on the quarterback in just 1.2% of his pass-blocking snaps, second best in the Pac-12.
“I’m eager to lead my teammates down the tunnel of the Coliseum next month and show the college football world that the Trojans are ready to play,” Vera-Tucker said. “I can’t wait to get started and play the game I love. Fight On, Trojan Family.”

One of the biggest blows to the NFL last week was the rescheduling of the undefeated Tennessee Titans and Pittsburgh Steelers game due to 20 coronavirus cases among players and staff personnel as of Sunday. Additionally, the league had to push back the Kansas City Chiefs’ game against the New England Patriots from Sunday to Monday because Patriots quarterback Cam Newton and Chiefs backup quarterback Jordan Ta’amu both tested positive.  
Luckily, the NFL was able to pull off a new schedule for the league where the Titans and Steelers can play in Week 7 and have a bye for Week 4. However, there are more concerns now on whether next week’s game against the Buffalo Bills can even occur because it is unclear if all the players and members of the Titans organization can quarantine and recover quickly enough to play against the 4-0 Bills. 
Unlike other leagues that are implementing a bubble system to contain the spread of the virus, such as the NBA and now the MLB for the playoffs, the NFL is having teams and their players travel across the country to play, obviously increasing the risk of spreading the virus. So, it was inevitable that someone or a group of players and staff would end up testing positive. However, the quick testing protocols are working because it would have been even more catastrophic if the Titans were not properly tested and went to go play the Steelers, transmitting the virus further.
Overall, it appears that the NFL is faced with something similar that USC students can relate to right now: midterms and exams. The NFL was getting through its lectures and other coursework with little worry initially, but now the league just opened its first exam in COVID 101 and is figuring out how to tackle these problems. Right now, the league’s solution is to work around these obstacles through rescheduling. 
But how long can this strategy last before severe actions like shortening the season must be taken?
In the end, if cases keep rising in the league, the NFL can only reschedule a certain number of times before it has to begin decreasing the total number of games played. This could hurt the league’s competitive integrity and cause financial uncertainty due to potential losses in TV viewership and advertising. 
I can’t travel through time, so I can’t tell you what will happen going forward. But it is critical for the NFL to proceed with much more caution before it becomes logistically impossible to keep shuffling the regular-season matchups.  
On the same note, it will be important to note how the Pac-12 and USC will handle this type of situation when a player or staff member contracts the virus. Currently, the Pac-12 implements a daily testing protocol for student-athletes and athletic departments in partnership with the testing company Quidel. The conference is also adding a surveillance test with Fulgent Genetics which uses RT-PCR, a more effective method for testing. Ensuring that the players and staff are staying safe using repetitive and efficient testing is a crucial move by the conference as it gears up to start the season. 
At the moment, USC football is slated to return Nov. 7 against Arizona State, kicking off a seven-game, conference-only schedule that runs until Dec. 19. The Pac-12 was wise to limit the games within the conference since the schools will be contained to the West Coast and won’t risk cross country travel. However, we must remember many schools in the conference are in major metropolitan areas, so it is important to ensure that the players traveling do not affect those dense populations who are already at greater risk of contracting coronavirus. 
The main reason the NFL failed is that it did not strictly enforce its coronavirus protocol. The league simply resorts to fines instead of actually reprimanding those who do not comply with its rules. For instance, in games the league lets coaches remove masks at the price of a fine. This punishment isn’t yielding results, as seen with Las Vegas Raiders head coach Jon Gruden, who was fined once then still didn’t properly wear a mask last Sunday. 
Thankfully, after messing up on its first exam, new reports are showing that the NFL is now planning to take more serious actions and measures to limit the spread through a video monitoring system and to significantly hurt non-complying organizations by taking away draft picks or forcing teams to forfeit games. 
The Pac-12 has almost a month to learn from the NFL, and unlike the rest of us, who cram for tests at the last minute, the conference should start taking notes now. It needs to add protocols such as video systems to keep an eye on players and staff, include punishments for schools that do not follow guidelines by taking away athletic scholarships for recruitment and impose forfeits in hopes that colleges take this seriously. In the case that the virus spreads among players and staff, the Pac-12’s testing system should be able to recognize who is infected. The conference should postpone games between affected schools until it knows who has been infected, similar to what happened with the Chiefs and Patriots.
Even though the season is a month away, it is extremely important that all schools in the Pac-12 proceed with great caution. Keeping up with this college student analogy, the Pac-12 is that student taking the exam after all the other students have finished, so it needs to learn from the NFL’s mistakes and utilize better strategies before walking into its own test next month.

It’s been a week since the first presidential debate — if you can even call it that. As entertaining as it was, I stopped laughing when I realized that this was what American politics have become: no more than a sandbox quarrel between two toddlers fighting over a toy. 
It’s not funny — and frankly none of our current political discourse is humorous. 
Underlying the near hour and a half couple’s therapy session that was the debate is a fundamental problem severely prevalent in today’s society: political polarization. Defined as “the vast and growing gap between liberals and conservatives, Republicans and Democrats” by the Pew Research Center, political polarization is not a new phenomenon, yet it has grown since the last election cycle in 2016 as levels of animosity and division, including negative views shared by partisans toward members of the opposing political party, continue to increase. For example, in a December survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, it was reported that 55% of Republicans say Democrats are “more immoral” when compared with other Americans and 47% of Democrats say the same about Republicans — both numbers significantly higher than the last election. 
Political polarization poses a huge threat to democracy. Fostered by both fear and hatred, such polarization leaves no room for progress and leads to inaction within the government. This “my way or the highway” ideologically rigid mentality evident in both parties significantly “lower[s] the probability of achieving the compromise that should be at the heart of legislative functioning,” as emphasized in a recent Gallup news release. Don’t get me wrong: Political polarization can be beneficial to a certain extent as healthy disagreement and conflict between the parties lends to the useful tension that fuels democracy. That being said, we’re at a point in United States history where partisanship has become synonymous with patriotism and the need to destroy the other side becomes the ultimate goal. This is precisely how democracies cripple and ultimately erode. 
While the debate presented this growing divide clearly, another everyday example is the political discourse found on social media. Scrolling through my Instagram post-debate, I found most of the stories to be a reposted graphic reading the words in the bolded letters “If you vote for Trump, you’re a racist.” Trust me, while I wholeheartedly agree with the bottom part of the graphic that says “Donald Trump will not denounce white supremacists because he is one,” since it’s quite inarguable that President Trump is a misogynistic racist, I don’t think calling every single supporter or the broader Republican party racist is beneficial — as demonstrated in the comment section of the post just before it was disabled.
Such graphics not only ignite unnecessarily hateful rhetoric, but they also (more importantly) destroy any chance of growth or compromise, contributing to the political divide between red and blue. If there’s any chance of “converting” MAGA-hat wearing Americans to understand the implications of having Trump in office again, this isn’t the way to do it. We must take another second to educate them instead of merely attacking. 
To combat partisanship and political polarization, conversations between members of opposing parties need to make room for empathy. Someone who has empathy is “capable of understanding and recognizing others’ needs, goals, feelings, priorities and perspectives by engaging in active listening and focusing on reflective responses that clarify and strengthen dialogue,” as defined by the USC Center for Third Space Thinking. This soft skill must be applied and used greatly within our current political climate. 
Ignorance isn’t bliss and there is most certainly no place for ignorance in this election. 
Voters must overlook their own privilege and start viewing current issues not only from their own limited perspective, but also from the perspectives of those who will be most affected by the onset of a second reign of the Trump administration. To stop political polarization before it reaches the point of no return, voters must place empathy at the center of their political discourse. By applying this mindset, political divides can become less threatening to the advent of society and over time may result in healthy bipartisanship. Learning to take a second to listen and communicate effectively with each other among neighbors, friends and family is the first step in overcoming a divide that has unrightly labeled the Black Lives Matter movement a political issue instead of a humanitarian issue. 
For the sake of humanity, don’t forget to vote by Nov. 3. Let’s change history together — because frankly, it’s about damn time.

Fresh off Netflix’s new content list comes “Emily in Paris,” a charming show involving a young social media and marketing professional, Emily, who takes a job in Paris. A new Netflix Original is always an instant grab — and this show is no exception.
The show follows Emily Cooper (Lily Collins) as she moves to Paris from Chicago after her boss Madeline (Kate Walsh) becomes pregnant and can no longer go. While this presents an exciting new opportunity for Emily, her whimsical and romantic perspective of Paris is quickly mocked by her new coworkers, especially her new boss. 
Without any French-speaking capabilities and only taking with her an American perspective, Emily is not easily welcomed or liked by the French people around her. As a result, she must find her way through Paris with a little help from her new friend, her quirky French coworkers, her Instagram account, a hot French neighbor and plenty of croissants. 
Darren Star, the executive producer and creator of “Emily in Paris,” took major inspiration for the new series from his hit television show “Sex and the City,” which came out in the ’90s and was based on the book written by Candace Bushnell. Star revived the iconic Carrie Bradshaw character, played by Sarah Jessica Parker, and turned her into the relatable and endearing Emily Cooper, with their similar fashion sense and love for men. 
While Carrie was a columnist in New York, Emily is a social media and marketing professional who starts her growing Instagram account with the handle @emilyinparis after her big move to the city. Her Instagram page is perhaps the 2020 equivalent to Carrie Bradshaw’s iconic column, “Sex and the City.” 
Emily’s new Instagram account becomes a plotline in the show and the common thread throughout. As the episodes progress, her account grows and as viewers, we get to see the pictures she takes, the number of likes and comments and her increase in followers. 
In the new world of social media, influencer culture has become more and more popular. Influencers have become celebrities in their own right and are more accessible to everyday people. The addition of influencer culture into the show gives the viewer a glimpse into how people start their accounts and later become successful. 
While in Paris, Emily gets brand deals and makes connections with other influencers and celebrities. This was an interesting decision made by Star but one that fits into the plot perfectly. Emily’s expertise is in marketing and specifically running social media pages, so it only would make sense that she has her own successful social media following. 
The culture shock in this show is highlighted in every episode and becomes a somewhat tired storyline. Emily brave-heartedly moves to Paris without any knowledge of the French language. This fact was quickly acknowledged by Savior, the French marketing company she is working for. We see Emily taking French classes, struggling with how to conduct simple conversations and constantly needing a translator. 
Another important cultural distinction brought up is Emily’s attitude toward working. “You live to work, we work to live,” her coworker says to her. The French philosophy of work is different from that of the United States. Whether it was coming to work at 8:30 a.m. two hours before the office opens, having a normal two-hour long lunch or discussing work with a client at an event, Emily seems to do it all wrong all the time. 
The stark contrast between the two cultures is a little overdone, leading Emily to mess up in some way almost every episode. She is the basic and overly positive American girl, unlike the elegant and sophisticated French people that surround her. 
Emily finds herself in situations where things are going wrong and, surprise surprise, at the end of the day, she is the one who saves them. She is always in the right place at the right time and able to use her charming personality to save the entire project. Although this becomes a little annoying as the episodes continue, you keep watching because Emily is a likable character and at the end of the day, you want her to succeed. 
With only 10 episodes around 30 minutes each, you are quickly introduced to the plot and the beautiful Parisian scenery. Almost every shot gives the viewer a beautiful glimpse into the historic and elegant city. 
The wardrobe choices are also spot on. While Emily’s new Parisian boss dresses elegantly and professionally, Emily takes on fun fashion choices and breathes lots of life and color into each shot. Her quirky personality is directly translated through her outfits. 
Overall, “Emily in Paris” is the perfect series to watch right now. It’s short, witty and light-hearted. Emily’s love for men, work and croissants are relatable and fun plotlines are littered throughout the show. But perhaps Emily’s greatest love is Paris, even though Paris does not love her back.

What do Zoe Saldana, Kid Cudi and David Ortiz all have in common? That’s right! They’re all Afro-Latinx, but without a quick Google search, would you have known? Across all professions, especially the art realm, Afro-Latinx people aren’t represented, so much so that people have never heard the phrase.
The term Afro-Latinx started as a way to identify those who were Latinx with African heritage. Still, as time continued and the word evolved, those who are biracial have found identification with the term. 
The word though became popularized recently as more people have come to identify with it. Why, you may ask? Anti-Blackness in the Latinx community is unshakeable and finds itself in many facets of life, so some distance themselves from their Black roots. It appears when aunts and uncles tell their nieces and nephews to break up with Afro-Latinos to “mejor la raza” (improve the race) or on TV when darker-skinned Latinos play maids and gardeners.
While some aren’t aware of the lack of Afro-Latinx representation, I think it’s time to talk about it, so who better to speak on the issues than Afro-Latinx people at USC?
This aforementioned anti-Blackness proves harmful to Afro-Latinx communities, especially when exploring and solidifying identity. Arantza Peña Popo, a sophomore majoring in journalism who is Afro-Colombian, explained how extreme the nonacceptance of Blackness is in the Latinx community.  
“It’s like really bad; like people who were super Black will think they’re white and [it] becomes a rejection of … the past and of things like slavery,” Peña Popo said. “There’s a culture of washing away any kind of hint of African.” 
Being both Black and Latinx has left some people feeling as though they don’t fit into either space because they have both of their identities. Since both cultures have their own different traditions and practices, siding with one over the other, socially, ignores a large part of the Afro-Latinx identity. This has been the case for Alayada Young, a sophomore majoring in NGOs and social change who is Nicaraguan with African descent. 
“When I go into Latinx spaces, I sometimes feel like I don’t belong, and sometimes when I go into Black spaces, I feel like I don’t belong just because I’m not evidently Latine from appearance,” Young said. “I’m not like the typical Black person. So [I have] a hard time feeling like I belong to both cultures when each space is just predominantly [one] part of me.”
Similarly, there are also occasions where people feel erasure from certain identities because of how people from the Black community or Latinx community perceive them. For Pauline Woodley, a junior majoring in journalism who is half Mexican and half Black, she felt as though she wasn’t enough for either of her identities. 
“I guess it makes me question who I was at the end of the day because I don’t speak Spanish perfectly,” Woodley said. “I don’t know as much about my Mexican ancestry as I should. And I know that if I were of  a lighter complexion, that wouldn’t really be like a big deal. But because I’m half-black, I almost find myself having to overcompensate for not being as Mexican as I should be. I never grew up in a Black family, so I found myself in these Black spaces where I would second guess myself and who I was. So yeah, I think it just made me more unsure of my identity.”
Looking at the journalism space in particular, Afro-Latinx people, as reporters and in coverage, are few and far between. Since the coverage of Afro-Latinx people is minimal, the closest option is to hear stories about Black and Latinx people as separate entities, which doesn’t represent their full identity. That coverage, too, is largely unsatisfactory because of how many in both groups find it inaccurate.
For Woodley, being aware that there is a demographic of Afro-Latinx people that exist, as well as identifying as such, she tries to bring the community’s stories to the table. Knowing that these stories are largely unacknowledged, she said she uses her identity as an advantage in the newsroom.
“I want my perspective to be known straight off the bat,” Woodley said. “I think that with that comes doing stories that other people wouldn’t do or even pitching stories that other people wouldn’t really like to think of. “I think it definitely unlocks this other layer of creativity because I have this dual perspective of the world.”
For those in the world of makeup, the inherent anti-Blackness in the Latinx community permeates. With Eurocentric beauty standards being the marker of beauty in many Latinx countries, the beauty industry doesn’t reflect those with darker skin. For Young, who visibly presents as a Black woman, displaying darker skin in the beauty industry is crucial. 
“I realized that in the makeup artists industry … if you do see Latinx people, it’s mostly white Latinx people,” Young said. “I feel like we need more representation as Afro-Latine people with makeup because makeup is such a beautiful thing and like seeing it on different shades of people is so important.” 
What makes it so important is that darker-skinned Afro-Latinx people would recognize and understand that lighter skin and other typically white features don’t make someone more desirable. 
The art space is also tough to enter because most people view art without knowing the face or heritage of the artist creating it. The most overt ways artists could disclose their ethnicity to audiences would be declaring it outright or having a Latinx-sounding name. 
For Peña Popo, she distinguishes her Afro-Latinx identity by including “Angsty Afro-Latinx Girl” in her Instagram bio. In the past, she has mixed elements of Colombian Indigenous patterns in her artwork.
Expressing identity through art can be done for a multitude of reasons in the creative space, but of those I spoke with, many want to provide representation so that others feel represented in their fields. For this reason, at its core, platforms for Afro-Latinx people are what is important, especially when it’s used to reach out to children.
“I think it’s kind of the same thing, you know, going at the ground level, like not just hiring  Afro-Latinos, but also encouraging more Afro-Latinos to study journalism or art and push them into those fields … so they won’t feel alienated,” Peña Popo said.
Afro-Latinx people shouldn’t have to feel the need to hide, or rather disguise, their Blackness or Latinx-ness. Their existence needs to be recognized and celebrated rather than sliced between two worlds like a real-life Miley Cyrus/Hannah Montana situation. The more representation they see, the more valid others who see themselves in that space will feel. Hard to hide when, according to the Pew Research Center, a quarter of Latinx people in the United States identify as Afro-Latino, huh?

There’s no doubt that getting your job application rejected by an employer can be difficult to stomach. Often, employers may not even disclose their rationale for the rejection due to legal reasons or time constraints. We’re all human at the end of the day and curiosity can get the best of us; however, we want to improve and figure out how to ace the next interview, application or job opportunity. 
Sadly, this whole charade sheds some light on our prejudice against accepted candidates or the company. For instance, identifying someone as a “diversity hire” — or accusing them of being accepted solely on the basis of their race or gender identity — can lead down a rabbit hole of distasteful thinking. That being said, there’s another issue that has been popping up recently. As you can expect from your resident gerontology student, I’m referring to the double-edged sword that is age in the workplace. 
On one hand, employers can overlook younger, fresh-out-of-college workers in favor of experienced, long-time employees who bring a veteran presence to the workplace. The other side of this coin is that older employees get booted out for a young and fresh group of new employees. 
To illustrate, I’ll even cite a quirky and unknown American comedy television show: “The Office.” The Student Gerontology Association hosted a Netflix Party event last week showcasing the episode “Dunder Mifflin Infinity.” In short, experimental company changes seem to push some of the older employees out of the office to make way for young, tech-savvy replacements. Michael, the regional manager played by Steve Carrell, and Creed Bratton, an employee of Dunder Mifflin played by none other than Creed Bratton himself, handle these changes in different ways throughout the course of the show. Where Creed tries to become more youthful and hip, Michael tackles ageism head-on in a hilarious “ageism seminar.”
Michael makes some fantastic points and some questionable ones but effectively shows what ageism looks like from an outsider’s perspective. Nonetheless, there’s just so much more to unpack when it comes to ageism. 
Ageism doesn’t persist in just the workplace — it’s everywhere, so much that the World Health Organization designates it the “most socially ‘normalized’ of any prejudice.” Efforts to counteract this form of stereotyping and discrimination have been slowly but surely ramping up, with USC’s annual celebration of the International Day for Older Persons last week acting as a testament to the work being done on the academic front. 
“But Lois,” you, the inquisitive reader, ask, “What’s the big deal? Everyone ages. Unlike other forms of discrimination such as sexism or racism, everyone undergoes the aging process and can be an older adult. So, if we’re just poking fun at the physical and emotional changes that everyone will eventually go through, is that so bad?”
Yes, it is.
For one, not everyone is fortunate enough to age into the later stages of life. We have certainly made improvements, but not all older adults are on the same playing field when it comes to available resources, whether those are social services, medical care or communication with family and friends. Life expectancy disparities are present across the world — country to country, city to city. For instance, a 2019 study by the Health Resources & Services Administration found that two cities in the state of Kansas have a life expectancy difference of over 14 years for their older adult populations. The many factors that characterize this discrepancy are certainly a story for another time but provide a necessary insight into some instances of ageism. 
Additionally, a big issue with ageism lies in the theory of stereotype embodiment, wherein the internalization of negative stereotypes leads to their fruition later down the line. In TikTok terms, you “manifest” a reality, but in this case, instead of manifesting passing your midterm or finding your crush in a small niche coffee shop, you manifest changes such as being hard of hearing or even slight memory loss, all due to perceived stereotypes of older adults. This constant cycle of learning about negative stereotypes, internalizing them and exhibiting them continues to impact the newer generations of older adults. 
That being said, we can divide these attitudes about aging into explicit and implicit biases, where explicit are controllable and external and implicit are natural and hidden. By recognizing these biases through implicit bias tests or reflection, we can better understand that aging isn’t necessarily the “deterioration” of the human body but rather a series of developmental changes that occur over time — I promise you that even just wording can make a world of a difference.
Recalling my last column installment, the stereotypes of older adults and technology are another clear example of ageist behaviors that undermine the ability of older people to participate in society to the fullest extent. When thinking about technology and who uses it, rarely do we ever picture older people surfing the web or scrolling through social media. That, in turn, translates into misconstrued stereotypes illustrating the inability of older adults to use technology or even that older adults despise such innovation altogether. 
As it pertains to everyday conversations, I encourage you to think about the last time you saw a positive video of an older person on social media or, if you can, the last time you spoke directly to an older adult. What did you say and how did you say it? The concept of infantilizing older adults — the act of speaking to older adults as if they were children rather than functioning individuals — is equally harmful. The older adults in our lives and in heartwarming videos on social media should not be viewed in the same way as a cute puppy or kitten. They’re people, too, and demonstrate the same feelings and emotions as you along with the other seven billion people on this planet.
I present a final and timely point. With the presidential election closing in and the pandemic playing a large role in our new understanding of older adults, it’s important to steer clear of ageist biases when selecting our representatives at the government level. Looking at our current government officials, it’s incredibly easy to tear down these individuals using the “elderly” stereotype that depicts frail and “slow” older adults. 
Here are a few of the current prominent officials and how they stack up age-wise: Sen. Elizabeth Warren is 71; President Donald Trump is 74; Former Vice President Joe Biden is 77; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is 78; Sen. Bernie Sanders is 79; Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is 80.
A quick search on the internet will bring up a handful of articles questioning the legitimacy of these older adults being in positions of power. With these officials reaching later into life, it may seem natural to have some doubts about their cognitive ability to lead the American people; however, it’s equally as important to recognize that, again, not all older adults are frail, weak and forgetful. Many of the politicians listed continue to make waves, whether you consider their age or not.
At the end of the day, discrimination of any form is unacceptable. Hopefully, we can reach the day where we figure out how to better care for our older adults — a point where we can reminisce about the changes we’ve made against ageism and discrimination in our lifetime, thinking, “Back in my day…”

As the coronavirus pandemic wears on, influencers have recently come under fire for their inability to cooperate with coronavirus prevention guidelines. TikTok and Instagram influencer Charli Jordan from the United States was recently called out for traveling overseas to Rwanda, where she received a false positive test for the coronavirus. Well-known YouTuber Jake Paul was similarly criticized for hosting a party in July at his Calabasas mansion, a party that Paul later defended as part of the right to not stop living his life just because of a pandemic — a convenient excuse to flaunt his continuous disregard of public safety. 
According to Los Angeles-based creator Elijah Daniel, many other influencers have tested positive for the coronavirus after attending such parties and have chosen to keep silent to avoid public backlash. 
It’s inevitable that influencers who participate in ill-timed trips and other inappropriate actions will have a negative impact on their viewers, who may subsequently feel inclined to engage in the risky behavior being promoted. In light of this, it is essential that influencers actively reconsider the extent to which they can promote a positive “influence” for the sake of society, especially during a pandemic. 
Influencers should act as role models by promoting a certain image or lifestyle, presumably one that has a positive impact on viewers. Neglecting to wear a mask or consistently going out to party not only defeats the purpose of this ability to positively influence attitudes, but it also has a detrimental effect on public health and exacerbates the effects of a worsening global health crisis. In these influencers’ attempts to provide a source of entertainment for their followers, they are also blatantly disregarding the real, harmful impact of their failure to adhere to these guidelines. 
Influencers need to look critically at what exactly they want their influence to be, especially amid the ongoing pandemic. Social media and digital platforms can be immensely helpful for spreading information about necessary precautions, but they can also become sources for misinformation with regard to such guidelines. It goes without saying that anyone with a platform should attempt to raise awareness about how to best cope during the coronavirus pandemic rather than deliberately and shamelessly flaunt the privilege they have by disregarding public safety rules. In turn, part of this responsibility also falls on viewers to call out influencers when they’re perpetuating harmful behavior patterns — specifically actions that, on a public health level, can be considered dangerous. 
It’s worth noting, of course, that for every influencer who engages in risky behavior, there are a handful who are promoting positive lifestyles in quarantine and at home. L.A.-based YouTuber Jenn Im, for example, who previously produced content centered on attending festivals and luxury brand events, hasn’t let a pandemic stop her from producing primarily safe, socially-distanced content, including videos such as “What I Ate in a Week (Healthy Asian Recipes)” and “A Day in My Life in Quarantine.” Such content demonstrates that instead of attempting to recapture their pre-pandemic lifestyles, influencers should reconsider what new angles they can apply to their content. 
This new form of innovative content isn’t just for the sake of the general public. Finding new ways to engage followers during quarantine can reassure viewers that influencers are, like everyone else, just trying to get through challenging times. In doing so, influencers might find that the “lifestyle” they’ve been attempting to market to their audiences doesn’t necessarily have to be one of glamorous parties and lavish entertainment. Instead, a more relatable lifestyle might be the one that currently piques viewers’ curiosity.  
Creating considerate coronavirus content can remind viewers of the importance of shared spaces for empathy in the digital space. As such, influencers need to reconsider how best they can adapt their content to the pandemic while making a positive contribution to society. That may not have been the kind of influence they originally intended —  but it’s the kind of influence society needs.

When Anusha Singh and Manushri Desai met during their freshman year at USC, they immediately connected over their shared passion for accessibility and justice.
Singh, a junior majoring in economics and math, had a background in advocacy and volunteer work during her senior year of high school through the creation of her nonprofit Build a Vision, which created tactile materials for children with limited vision. Desai, who is a pre-law student majoring in public policy, contributed research to a now-overturned case in the Supreme Court of India that allowed a student with limited vision to attend medical school.
The summer before Desai began her freshman year, she had visited the Blind People’s Association based in Gujarat, India, where she met with its executive director, who put her in contact with Pranav Desai. He founded the Voice of Specially Abled People, a global advocacy organization that works to increase accessibility for and inclusion of people with disabilities.  
VOSAP, which focuses on data-driven advocacy within the government and the general population, is in a “special consultative status” with the United Nations, which grants the organization access to the United Nations Economic and Social Council. 
After talking about their shared passion for disability advocacy, Singh and Desai decided to start VOSAP Collegiate in January to bring this disability rights narrative to college students. 
VOSAP Collegiate’s first initiative mapped out and rated USC’s accessibility across campus in hopes that other colleges across the nation would follow suit. 
As of last spring, Singh and Desai rated 90 building entrances across campus on their accessibility for students with mobility impairments. Their ratings were submitted to the VOSAP mobile app, a crowdsourced database that indicates the accessibility of buildings. 
“Once we got to USC, we kind of identified a need for bringing this technology that VOSAP had developed onto our campus,” Desai said. “We saw a need for identifying which places were accessible and inaccessible, and that led us to engage with the USC population to use this technology and hopefully make buildings on our campus a bit more accessible.”
However, their continued efforts on campus were blocked by the switch to remote learning last spring, and VOSAP Collegiate could no longer physically map the rest of campus. Singh and Desai then decided to transition the organization on a more research-based spectrum, and they created a 10-week summer internship program with 28 undergraduate students from USC, UCLA, University of Texas at Austin, Cornell University and Northwestern University.
Students split into 14 teams to research topics such as vaccines and disability, media representation of disability, a disability inclusion index, the legal history surrounding disabilities and public transportation options for disabled people. Interns also had networking opportunities in Zoom breakout rooms to meet one another.
“The goal is to really build a global network of disability rights advocates at universities across the world,” Desai said. “So hopefully we’re able to build the right platform for that and find other changemakers like ourselves that are incredibly passionate about disability rights and disability justice.”
Singh said that once she perceived the far reach VOSAP Collegiate had across the country, she realized how much potential the internship provided.
“These are people across all different walks of life that may work different professional jobs, across different age ranges, but all of them are connected by this one passion and empathy for persons with disabilities, whether these volunteers are able bodied or disabled themselves,” Desai said. “I think that’s the really incredible and unique thing about VOSAP.”
Sarah Schaefer, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering, spent the VOSAP internship researching assistive technology for primary and secondary schools. Schaefer said she found it interesting how much assistive technology is integrated into existing technologies, such as apps within cell phones. She also believes to effectively advocate for disability rights, one must have a mindset for realizing the disabled community’s difficulties and be willing to distinguish these barriers.
“The fact that my work is going to help somebody — I mean, my biggest goal in life is to help as many people as possible — just the fact that something good could come out of this,” Schaefer said. “This could be something that I work on in the future.”
Katelyn Lee, another VOSAP Collegiate intern, worked with a student from Cornell over the summer to analyze legal milestones in the disability sector with an emphasis on employment.
“I think the pandemic really put things in perspective. All I ever want to do is help advocate on behalf of people who don’t really have a voice in society because of the barriers we have,” said Lee, a junior majoring in philosophy politics and law who is pursuing a progressive master’s degree in public policy. “I thought it was a really great opportunity to get involved in research, but also do research that would ultimately benefit the persons with disabilities community and help to find ways in which we can eliminate all the barriers that prevent all kinds of persons from being able to really find meaning in their lives.”
During the final week of the internship, each team gave a 15-20 minute presentation to communicate their findings to Singh and Desai based around five general categories, such as disability advocacy in corporations, and presented the professional development research models they worked on throughout the internship. 
“I was still interested and shocked to learn about everything that they have come up with, even though I have seen them on a weekly basis, and I knew exactly what they were researching,” Singh said. “To see it all come together was one of the most amazing things.”
In addition to the presentations, VOSAP Collegiate also invited industry professionals ranging from singers and actresses to corporate professionals to listen to the summer research and engage with the interns, Singh said.
For Desai and Singh, the final week of the internship was the most memorable. They said that the presentations were very special and demonstrated their interns’ tangible efforts in their research.
“We were twice as motivated that these 28 people that we had worked with, these interns, would carry on to inspire others,” Desai said. “That’s really kind of this domino effect that we hope to see through those in VOSAP Collegiate — once we inspire one person, they can inspire 10 more people, those 10 people can inspire many more. And so that was really, I think, monumental for both of us to see through the research interns.”
For future projects, Singh said that VOSAP Collegiate hopes to identify individuals who are passionate about disability rights at USC and across different colleges to educate and advocate for accessibility. Desai and Singh also said they look to understand the day-to-day problems that students with disabilities encounter, so they can advocate for change based on those narratives. 
“I think the need for accessibility is always evolving, especially for students … to have greater access to education,” Singh said. “Through the years, we want to be able to have established leadership teams across these college campuses to be able to execute this vision.”
Correction: A previous version of this article, misidentified Anusha Singh’s nonprofit as “Bill Division” rather than “Build a Vision.” The article also mislabeled the organization as a USC chapter when it goes by “VOSAP Collegiate” and misquoted a phrase that implied Singh and Manushri Desai created the VOSAP app. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors. 
Clarification: Singh and Desai rated “building entrances” not “buildings” as was previously stated.

Over the summer, millions of people took to the streets to protest racial injustices and police brutality following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, putting themselves at risk for physical injury. In response to the protests, a group of recent USC Department of Physical Therapy graduates launched the Movement Network. Formerly known as PT4 Justice, the group aims to provide pro bono physical therapy treatment and education to those injured in the fight for racial equality. 
“I think it’s a sign that this is not a moment; it’s a movement,” said Kari Ayoob, a USC alumna who is one of the group’s executive board members. “I think it’s really encouraging to see people not lose momentum and keep up the endurance that it takes to make systemic societal change.”
Ayoob started the organization on social media over the summer by inviting physical therapy graduates from USC to offer services to injured protesters. 
“I think all of us get into this profession with the goal to help people and keep people out of hospitals and help people live their lives pain free,” Ayoob said. “We also recognize that this type of medicine is not accessible to everybody, so finding a venue that you can really help these vulnerable populations to prevent them from living in pain or needing invasive procedures or expensive procedures is really encouraging and so we had a really strong response from [physical therapists] around the country which is why we decided to make this a legitimate organization that would last.”
Chelsea Lauren, a Los Angeles-based photojournalist, documented protests following the police killing of Floyd and first heard about the Movement Network via Instagram. In past protests, Lauren suffered neck injuries after being pushed by the police as well as moving heavy camera equipment to cover the protests. Despite the injuries, she kept returning to protests. 
“I think what [the Movement Network] is doing is amazing because a lot of protesters might not have the means, especially right now with coronavirus,” Lauren said. “If it is a cause that is important to them, it’s important for people to be able to contribute in any way they can and the Movement Network finding that way to contribute is really special, and it shows that anyone can contribute if they put a little bit of thought into how … they can service the movement.”
When she reached out to the Movement Network, she didn’t expect much help. But in her session with the Movement Network, Lauren video-chatted with one of the physical therapists and, after a quick diagnosis, was given a plan for the best exercises to relieve her body pain. 
“To be honest, I liked [the Movement Network physical therapist] a lot better than previous physical therapists I’ve had for injuries in the past,” Lauren said. “And even virtually she really cares.”
Once word got out about the goal and impact of Movement Network, physical therapists from other states and cities reached out to see how they could help. From its initial group of 11 USC alumni, the organization has grown to 70 physical therapists in 13 states.
“At the very beginning, we had a lot of teachers reaching out to us and so we started creating this list of people from all over the country,” Ayoob said. “When anybody contacted us saying that they needed services, we would connect them with the PT from the state who was licensed in their state to treat that … We are like a referral source for people just to get information about their injuries.” 
Symiah Campbell, a 2019 USC graduate from the physical therapy program, first heard about the Movement Network from Ayoob’s social media posts. 
“Physical therapists are people that want to help others … We go to work and we love our jobs, but we want to continue doing more and we want to continue giving back to the community,” Campbell said. “Whether it’s by race or by socioeconomic status, the health care available for people is not always equal across the board. So, you know, now that I am a health care provider, it’s really important to me that I do something to try to limit that problem.”
Before each free session, a licensed physical therapist from the patient’s state contacts them to set up an appointment, either virtual or in person. During said appointment, the physical therapist evaluates the patient’s symptoms, cause of injury and movement restrictions to determine a customized plan of care that includes home exercises and recommendations for other local doctors. 
“As physical therapists, we are here to work in all types of settings,” Campbell said. “We work with musculoskeletal injuries, lower back pain, neck pain, ankle sprains, neurological conditions like Parkinson’s, cardiovascular, pediatrics and the list goes on … At the Movement Network we’re trying to expand the knowledge of what PT is and how patients can get access to physical therapy.”
The Movement Network is currently filing for nonprofit status with the help of a pro bono law firm while creating partnerships with other nongovernmental organizations in L.A. The organization wants to continue helping underserved populations with little access to health care and insurance via free clinics across the country.  
“[We] expanded the Movement Network so that we could provide services, not just related to racial injustice and people fighting for racial justice, but to communities throughout the country that didn’t have access to PT,” Ayoob said. “Our goal now is to expand access to our preventative health care that prevents people from needing expensive surgeries or prolonged time on pain medications.”
