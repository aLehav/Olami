The USC campus is home to some iconic statues, and it only takes a short walk around campus to spot at least a few of them. Some are popular photo op spots while others are considered hidden gems. Below are just a few of the best statues at USC.

Tommy Trojan
Tommy Trojan is probably the most iconic statue on our campus. It’s likely we all have pictures of us as prospective or newly admitted students doing the typical “fight-on” pose in front of the statue. Maybe it was even your profile picture for awhile. It was dedicated in 1930 in honor of the semicentennial anniversary of the university. Along the base, one can read the words “faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous and ambitious,” words that are supposed to represent the ideal qualities of a Trojan. Although we’ve all seen it a million times on the way to class, it’s so iconic that it deserves No. 1.

Traveler 
While many people mistakenly believe that Tommy Trojan is our mascot, true Trojans know that it’s actually Traveler. It’s probably the second most iconic statue on campus, again popular for photos, located right in the center of campus across from Tommy Trojan. Although our mascot has appeared at our games since 1961, the statue was gifted to the University in 2010.

Tirebiter
George Tirebiter guards the entrance to campus from Exposition, and is the ex-USC mascot. Legend has it that when Trousdale was a street with regular traffic on it, the original Tirebiter would chase the cars and bite their tires. Although we changed our mascot, it’s still good luck to pet him before football games!

Youth Triumphant
You might not recognize the name of this statue, but you have definitely seen it. This statue is of a dancing figure in the fountain in front of Doheny Memorial Library. What is particularly magical about this statue is that it seems to take on particular characteristics and emotions depending on the angle it is viewed from. The statue currently standing is the second cast of the statute, since the first was damaged by falling trees.

USC Cinematic Arts Statue
The beautiful USC School of Cinematic Arts has two statues within its gates. The most recognizable is of actor Douglas Fairbanks who triumphantly holds a script in one hand and a sword in the other. Fairbanks was a famous actor of the early 1900s and one of the founders of SCA, which is the oldest film school in the country. Go see this statue at night, when the building and surrounding fountain is all lit up!
If you walk toward the School of Cinematic Arts (SCI) building, you will find the statue of Edward Muybridge, an innovator in the field of motion pictures. When Leland Stanford wanted to find out if a horse was ever fully airborne while galloping, he hired Muybridge who rigged a series of twelve cameras that captured the truth — that a horse does in face have all four feet off the ground at one point while running. His work created an early form of stop motion. See if you can spot how the statue depicts this story.

Neil Armstrong
If you want to be inspired by one of our famous alumni, take a second to find the Neil Armstrong statue and realize that USC can take your future to the stars! This statue is located in the engineering quad and depicts him in a spacesuit and holding his helmet beside him. Armstrong attended USC for a graduate degree in aerospace engineering before being the first person to set foot on the moon in 1969.

Harris Hall & Watt Hall Lawn Sculpture Garden 
This sculpture garden holds a variety of pieces, and is hidden right off of Exposition Boulevard. Four of the sculptures in the garden are by Marc Lere. His large geometric shapes were specifically designed to appeal to different senses. In 2007, they were moved from the Staples Center to USC. 
Also in this area is the statue Crouching Bather near the entrance to Fisher Art Gallery. This piece holds some interesting history, in that the artist, Antoine Bourdelle, was an assistant to Rodin as well as Giacometti’s teacher.

Trojan Column
Did you know we also have an artifact on our campus? Right by Taper Hall is the Trojan Column, a piece of granite from the Roman Empire that was probably found near the site of the city of Troy.

We can all agree that USC is a picturesque campus, known for its Romanesque and Gothic architecture. But, where are the best photo op spots on campus? 
Trevor Sochocki | Daily Trojan
Mudd Hall Entranceway
This Tuscan courtyard is filled with red-and-white brick arches and elegant corinthian columns, and the sounds of the water fountain add to the dreaminess of the space. If you haven’t already taken your LinkedIn profile picture here, it’s only a matter of time before you do because nothing says “hire me” like the combination of business attire and this iconic backdrop. 
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
Fisher Museum Garden
Beside the entrance to the Fisher Museum lies a garden seating area featuring quotes from a turbulent in Hollywood. From far away, the benches and shrubbery seem idyllic; however, a viewer is immersed with quotes from actors, such as Gregory Peck. These creative artists are known as the “Hollywood Ten,” individuals that refused to stand before the House Un-American Activities Committee for scrutiny of their political beliefs. This garden echoes the struggles of censorship, which took place in 1950s Hollywood. 
Trevor Sochocki | Daily Trojan
Literatea Courtyard 
With a latte in hand, the courtyard beside Literatea serves as a lovely setting to meet with friends, or catch up on some work. The coziness and sheer beauty of the space make it an ideal spot for a photo. 
Trevor Sochocki | Daily Trojan
Bovard Entrance
The brick arches outside of Bovard Auditorium serve as a charming background to any photo. Next time you find yourself in line for a guest speaker or music performance make sure to take a quick photo.
Trevor Sochocki | Daily Trojan
Tommy Trojan 
The pinnacle of all USC campus visits begin and end with a photo in front of the Tommy Trojan statue. Whether you took a photo by Tommy during orientation as an incoming freshman or during your final semester as a graduating senior, all roads lead back to a photo op with Tommy.

From acai bowls to burgers to ramen, USC restaurants have it all. No matter what mood you are in, USC guarantees that a restaurant will quench your cravings. Here are the top 10 places to eat on campus: 
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
Moreton Fig
Located in the center of campus, this upscale dining choice is perfect for a fancier lunch. Sit outside on the restaurant patio in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center to slow down your day and enjoy the fresh food at this full service restaurant.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
Little Galen
Little Galen is a hidden treasure you can sneak away to for lunch. Partnered with the USC Athletics Department, Little Galen is only open weekdays from noon to 2 p.m., so make sure you get your chance to snag a delicious lunch.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
Fertitta Cafe
In collaboration with the Marshall School of Business, Fertitta Cafe is located on on the first floor of Jill and Frank Fertitta Hall. From dim sum, to noodle and rice bowls, to a sushi bar, Fertitata Cafe is the perfect place to grab some tasty Asian cuisine.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
Nekter
Acai bowls and smoothies are L.A. staples. Swing by Nekter for a fresh, fruity meal to add some zest to your day in true fashion of the healthy L.A. lifestyle.
Trevor Sochocki | Daily Trojan
Verde
What better way to make your favorite Mexican food meal than customizing it at Verde? This restaurant is easily accessible in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and has fresh-tasting Mexican food yet still has a lot of flavor whether you get a burrito or a salad. 
Trevor Sochocki | Daily Trojan
Lemonade
Lemonade is one of the many classic LA restaurants. From veggies to protein to mac and cheese, Lemonade has options for all food preferences. The best part? You can mix and match whatever food you want by making a multiple-portion plate!
Trevor Sochocki | Daily Trojan
Literatea
This charming spot is the perfect place to grab a coffee and a quick snack. Sit back and relax the outdoor patio of Literatea located in the back of Doheny Library.
Trevor Sochocki | Daily Trojan
Seeds
While Seeds may technically be more of a market than a restaurant, custom omelettes in the mornings, salads at lunch and hot meals in the evening sounds great to me. Seeds is all about good food and convenience — grab a meal and all of your market snacks in one place.
Trevor Sochocki | Daily Trojan
Ground Zero
This trendy coffee shop hosts a relaxed and artsy vibe. I highly recommend ordering their famous milkshakes and attending their open mic nights on Mondays.
Trevor Sochocki | Daily Trojan
California Pizza Kitchen
Located in the campus center, CPK is a great option for Italian food on the go. Enjoy pizza, pasta and salad at this popular restaurant originally founded in Beverly Hills.

Ground Zero
Known for their “kick back and chill” atmosphere, Ground Zero is the perfect spot to get some casual studying done or check out weekly open mic night every Monday night at 9 p.m. As a vegan, I was overjoyed when they began offering vegan shakes since I didn’t want to miss out on all the yummy offerings they are serving up. Ground Zero stays open pretty late which is perfect with finals cram sessions coming up. With shakes and a show, you can’t go wrong with the Five Dollar Shake to Everything but the Girl Scout milkshakes on the menu. For any other vegans out there, I recommend the Death By Chocolate, complete with vegan double chocolate powder and oreos.
Hours: Monday to Friday: 8:30 a.m.-12 a.m., Saturday to Sunday: 1 p.m.-12 a.m.

New Annenberg Illy Café
The Illy Café is a relatively new installment on campus. This Italian style bistro serves a selection of coffees, juices, and even baguette and breakfast sandwiches. Its convenient location in the new Annenberg building near the bookstore makes for a quick in between class pick me up. They even serve a small selection of desserts, including tiramisu and macarons in case you have a sweet tooth. They have espresso too so if anyone is feeling tired the next morning after pulling an all nighter study session this time of year Illy is the place to be! 
Hours: Monday to Thursday: 7:30 am-9:30 pm, Friday: 7:30 am-5 pm

Starbucks at McCarthy Quad 
For anyone that still knows this on-campus Starbucks as “TroGro” (short for Trojan Grounds), then you know what to expect from this staple caffeine supplier. Despite the lines always being long, TroGo also sells dozens of snacks, juices, bottled water and premade lunches such as sushi, sandwiches and even pad thai noodles. I tend to avoid due to the Disneyland-status lines, but life hack: Try using the Tapingo app to skip the constant line out the door! There is a separate line for Tapingo customers that let’s you walk right up and get your caramel macchiato after you receive a notification from the app. 
Hours: 24 Hours 
Trevor Sochocki | Daily Trojan
Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf at the School of Cinematic Arts 
If you’re looking for a scenic spot to get away from the hussle and bussle of Trousdale or TCC, check out the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf nestled in the School of Cinematic Arts across from the Ostrow School of Dentistry and near the Lyons Center. The Italian villa-esque architecture has always caught my eye among the more gothic style building around campus. There is seating around one of USC’s many fountains as well plenty of seating outside at tables and benches. If you’re looking for a getaway between classes I would highly recommend this not-so-hidden gem. 
Hours: Monday to Thursday: 7 a.m.-8 p.m., Friday: 7 a.m.-5 p.m., Saturday to Sunday: 9 a.m.-3 p.m.
Trevor Sochocki | Daily Trojan
Dean’s List Café
Located next to the JEP House and the University Church on 34th Street is Dean’s List Café. The coffee shop’s cute string lights and artsy vibe offer a secluded sanctuary. Their menu boasts paninis, boba tea, coffee and even milkshakes. The brick walls and greenery that almost hide this secret treasure from sight from the street offer the perfect aesthetic for any Instagram picture. Recommended by the barista, the iced matcha green tea. And get this — you won’t pay extra for almond or soy milk, so lactose-free people can rejoice at saving their coins for another day.  
Hours: Weekdays 11 a.m.-10 p.m., Weekends 11 a.m.-7 p.m.

Craving some beautiful art? Want to immerse yourself in ancient and contemporary cultural symbols? Are you searching for a place to take cool Instagrams? The Los Angeles County Museum of Art might be just the place for you.
LACMA is one of the largest art museums in the West. Its vast collections include almost every form of art, from sculptures, paintings, jewelry, photography and even music.
I noticed the beautiful architecture as soon as I stepped into the museum’s premises. The infamous “Urban Lights” stood just outside of a peaceful garden with a small path surrounded by Rodin statues. Walking up the stairs, I could see the different buildings LACMA has, all of them beautiful.

LACMA boasts of many exhibits, including Renaissance paintings and sculptures, American contemporary photography, South and Southeast Asian art, and many more. As I made my way through the exhibitions, I noticed the familiar names of artists including Picasso, Renoir and Monet.
Outside, I could see Heizer’s famous “Levitated Mass” that has so often appeared on social media. It is a large-scale sculpture where a gigantic rock is suspended above a trench in which visitors can walk. People love to pose in such a way to make it seem as if they’re holding up the rock.

LACMA also has weekly concerts. LACMA hosts Latin Sounds, where musicians from Brazil, Cuba, Mexico and more perform on Saturday afternoons from Memorial Day through Labor Day. Sundays also see LACMA hosting Sundays Live, which showcases the best emerging musicians from around the world for free.
Best of all, on certain days and hours LACMA is completely free. After 3 p.m., Los Angeles County residents can visit the museum for free. Admission is also free on the second Tuesday of every month and on some federal holidays, including Martin Luther King Day and Memorial Day.

As I continue my journey to highlight the diverse identities that make up USC, the International Student Assembly’s Globefest embodies the true togetherness and celebration of international cultures. 
This festival is comprised of many moving parts: photo booths, milk tea with boba, traditional Vietnamese and Chinese dance performances, a petting zoo and a special appearance by Traveler. There truly was something for everyone to enjoy. Although the festival itself was a success by the sheer volume of attendees, I found the ISA members to be the greatest asset to the event.
Broadly speaking, ISA serves as an umbrella organization to cultural organizations on campus. On its Facebook page, ISA describes their mission as, “to promote international culture and raise diversity awareness on campus.” ISA delivers on their mission by hosting numerous events throughout the academic year, such as International Food Fair, iVoice, etc.
Vice President of Professional Affairs Lydia Yang discussed her initial difficulties acclimating to campus life. Being a L.A. native myself, I never once considered the alternate experiences of my fellow Trojans. Moving to L.A. from Beijing at 17 years old, Yang became more involved in campus life, which eventually led to her position on ISA.
“Be open minded and never be afraid,” Yang said when I asked what advice she had for her younger self.
It was her sheer resilience that led Yang to establish a community for herself at USC.
Having spoken to members of ISA, I understood the grave importance of providing not only a home for 24 percent of the university’s population, but also giving these students a chance to celebrate their distinct cultural identities. Events like Globefest, provide the opportunity for the broader USC community to learn and appreciate a variety of cultures in depth.
I relished the opportunity to eat Takoyaki, a ball-shaped Japanese snack, and watch Trogons, the first and only East Asian A Cappella at USC. An experience like this is only made possible through the planning and execution of ISA.

ISA’s Globefest invites individuals to meet from backgrounds across the world. I truly never knew the varying experiences of my fellow Trojans, until I took the time to listen with an open mind and compassionate heart.
ISA proudly showcases USC’s beautifully diverse campus life, while also bringing International students together to foster a supportive community.
