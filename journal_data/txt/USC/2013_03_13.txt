White smoke billowed from the chimney of St. Peter’s Basilica on Wednesday evening in Vatican City, signaling the selection of a new pope.
When the news reached Los Angeles at noon, students had diverse reactions to the election of 76-year-old Argentinian Archbishop Jorge Bergoglio, the first modern pope from Latin America, who cardinals chose to succeed Pope Benedict XVI, who resigned Feb. 28.
“I’m really happy with their decision because I think it’s time that not a white, old, European man controlled the church. It’s kind of moving in a new direction, so it will be nice to get some diversity in our leadership,” said  Moriah Mulroe, a freshman majoring in biochemistry and practicing Catholicism.
Many Latino students at USC agreed with Mulroe and were enthusiastic about the fact that Bergoglio hails from Argentina. Edwin Francisco Juárez Rosales, a Salvadorian doctoral student in the electrical engineering program and the religious education chair at the USC Caruso Catholic Center, expressed optimism at the papal selection.
“I’m really excited and truly happy … to have a Latin-American pope for the simple reason that Latin America represents the largest percentage of Catholics, including myself,” Rosales said.
Heidi Mayen, a student worker at El Centro Chicano, was also pleasantly surprised by the news.
“I would have thought he would have been a European pope,” Mayen said.
Bergoglio chose the name “Francis” for his papacy, making him the first Pope Francis in the church’s history. The name Francis comes from St. Francis of Assisi, whose prayer promotes love and helping others. The name is associated with inspirational preaching and evangelization.
Bergoglio is also unique in that he is the first Jesuit pope, something several students were excited about. The Jesuits are an order of Catholic priests founded by St. Ignatius of Loyola in the 16th century and are known for their work in education.
Some students responded positively to the new pope’s Jesuit affiliation.
“I had a great time in Jesuit [high] school and I thought that their ideas about Catholicism and life in general are really good for society,” said Bryan Curtis, a freshman majoring in civil engineering.
Rosales said he hopes the new pope’s Jesuit background will bring a new type of leadership to the Vatican.
“Part of [Jesuitic] spirituality is to bring God to the boundaries … but now they are taking the meaning of that to mean bringing Catholicism to areas it’s not present, for instance sciences,” said Rosales, who believes this Jesuit mentality will help the papacy.
Though some believe the selection of Bergoglio was an effort to move the church forward, others believe it will accomplish the opposite. Camille Saucier, a freshman majoring in psychology, was among the students hoping for a more progressive pope. Bergoglio is noted for his criticisms of socially progressive trends and staunch conservatism, according to the Washington Post.
“It’s nice to see that they’re having some ethnic diversity, but I mean, seriously, you really have to go with the most conservative guy?” Saucier said.
Jorge Molina, a freshman majoring in writing for screen and television, said the newly selected pope’s influence will be even more widespread because of his ethnic background.
“Being the first Latin-American pope, I think that it’s going to have [more cultural] representation in the church,” Molina said. “Culturally, coming from another background that’s not European, he can bring another perspective of the world.”
Bergoglio will officially be installed as pope at a Mass on Tuesday, according to a statement from the Vatican.
Apparently he is against gay marriage and gender neutral restrooms.   Hopefully he will reconsider both issues.

A panel of students and faculty shared their personal perspectives concerning issues affecting the United States’ Hispanic population on Wednesday as part of the weekly “Students Talk Back” series.
Changing voices · President of Southwest Voter Registration Education Project Antonio Gonzalez says perspectives shape politics. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Director of the Tomás Rivera Policy Institute Robert Suro moderated the panel for the series, which was presented by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, Sol Price School of Public Policy’s Tomás Rivera Policy Institute and the Sol Price Bedrosian Center on Governance and Public Enterprise.
Kevin Valero, a sophomore majoring in business administration and an undocumented immigrant and member of IDEAS Movement at USC, spoke about the Dream Act and potential he felt it held for undocumented immigrants and the United States.
Valero began by pointing to his ignorance of his situation as a child coming to the United States at the age of five. Though aware of his identity as a Mexican, he was not aware of his status as an illegal immigrant nor the implications of this status until he moved into high school and began thinking about the future.
“I was very young, so I didn’t know what moving from a country was, and there was no stigma attached to it,” Valero said. “Being undocumented wasn’t anything I thought about until the later years of high school, when I started thinking about my future and paying for college.”
Valero encouraged members of the audience to begin looking at the human aspects of the illegal immigration issue rather than just the politics. The first step, he stressed, was to stop using the term “illegal immigration.”
“I take offense to the term ‘illegal immigrant’ because how can I be illegal after being brought to a land?” Valero said. “It is dehumanizing.”
Continuing to emphasize the human angles of the immigration issue, Stephanie Canizales, a doctoral candidate in sociology, spoke about her work with unaccompanied, undocumented immigrant youths between the ages of 13 and 18 and mainly from Guatemala. Canizales said these youth come from persecuted indigenous groups in their countries and arrive in the United States in order to work for money to send their families back home.
“This youth population is not concerned with upward mobility, but with day-to-day survival, to every day, know that they came to the United States to provide for their families back home,” Canizales said.
Canizales went further to describe how the perspective of  undocumented children who first come to America.
“Imagine a 13-year-old coming to the United States unaccompanied, coming with a group of adult immigrants and getting a job in a garment shop in Downtown LA to provide for his family back home,” Canizales said.
Canizales said the Dream Act, which would allow undocumented students to gain full citizenry, focuses primarily on educated illegal immigrants, it fails to address as many as 67 percent of the 2.1 million illegal immigrant youths in the nation.
Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project, spoke about the Hispanic community and its activism. Gonzalez emphasized that this activism went beyond illegal immigration to other issues facing the Latino community and, in some cases, all Americans.
“The Latino agenda has to be a broad agenda,” Gonzalez said. “We can’t put all our cards in one issue or another issue, but the emphasis should be on taking responsibility.”
Gonzalez said he became active in politics because he felt it was the most impactful avenue to bring change and affect people’s lives.
“There is such a great disconnect between the country and Washington,” Gonzalez said. “President [Barack] Obama and the bipartisan establishment have presided over the largest reconcentration of wealth in the modern era. In many places, the problem is not racism, the problem is ineffective government.”
We must be all losing our minds, if we cannot see through the lies about the cost of a federal ID card. Expensive as it might be, it will be able to eliminate numerous problems we have to deal with today? The biometric document should be issued to every citizen and legal resident, not just workers? Blame for withholding of issuing a National ID card falls without any form of contradiction on both political parties. Democrats and their Liberal subsidiaries, the Republicans have not only been absent from protecting Americans from the illegal alien invasion, but the pandering to majority ethnic groups, including the outrageous cost of supporting them. I trust the Heritage Foundation for reporting after analysis that this next amnesty, if enacted will cost taxpayers $2.6 Trillion dollars to legitimately process and settle them. This dollar figure should not be confused with the $113 million dollars spent annually, which is rising as President Obama’ is spreading illegal cheer in the way of food stamps for all. The unsuspecting American taxpayers as with the signer, the late Ronald Reagan never realized of the undermining of funding and enforcement for the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA).  Republican campaign contributors for corporate welfare had their say and enforcement mainly became a useless word in the Federal Register. However that didn’t mean the GOP was entirely to blame, as assuredly so the Democrats assisted in the skillful fraud. Not even processing of the 3.6 million Guest Workers in the agriculture industry or others, who then flew the coop once they gained citizenship to the cities. The whole 1986 can be classed as really inoperable and it caused millions more were encouraged by the (IRCA) act, suddenly rushing to the poorly equipped borders, or overstaying there visitor, tourist or educational visas forever.
The tangible miasma of an amnesty or Comprehensive Immigration Reform floating around is the Border Patrol is already seeing an upsurge in numbers crossing the border. It was obvious this was going to happen, as illegal aliens are testing the chance of slipping past the border or arriving here as an inconspicuous visitor, who cannot be tracked once here. If the illegal population is truly 11 million, which the most prudent American doubt, that number will shortly fly through the roof as the U.S. government will not be able to contain the charge? Currently—what do we have as worthwhile identification—a Social Security number, a driver’s license or state issued ID card. Hundreds of data bases of legal immigrants are not centralized.  Because of this vital situation we have this unfortunate dilemma today, with a growing ration of stolen personal information. Illegal aliens using this form of identification, plus the SSN of deceased persons and even the number of infants and children, no to forget our troops overseas ID. I think for a matter of security and an individual’s personal information, we need a biometric card, which will not only identify the recipient as an authorized job seeker, but for many other entitlements.
 It will give the birthright or naturalized citizen the right to vote in all elections, stopping with a swipe of the card non-citizens from voting, as I sincerely believed happened in the presidential election. A biometric card with a scan of the holders thumbs print or a retinal impression or both, plus a picture will be very difficult to counterfeit. Election bickering would become a thing of the past, less expense in recounts and court cases over absentee ballots or electronic registration machines being compromised. In just this one sector of authentication hundreds of millions of dollars could remain in state coffers. Other possibilities of a onetime biometric card would be proof of who you are, for registering a car, applying for welfare or other entitlements and stop those criminals who are violating many different laws. Today we have an Internet industry that is selling other peoples personal ID, social security number and causing major anxiety to the individual who must jump through loops to gain their credit back, their integrity.  This kind of theft is predicament that I have been confronted with. Ask around—how many people do you know whose personal data has been procured in some way?  The financial impact to me was around $4000.00, is not the greatest amount, seeing that some members of the public have had their house equity stolen? 
So this gang of eight discussing our immigration future thinks $2.3 billion dollars is too costly.  I think a chimpanzee could produce better results for America, than we have now from these elected legislators. Then we must remember that every day they are intimidated by the special interest lobbyists. Some politicians might be entirely honest, but others have been corrupted by wealth and power.  They did take in to consideration the E-Verify provision, which is part of the SAVE ACT, which would do a lot to successfully remove illegal aliens from the workplace. But we need also strong punishments for those business owners, who believe they are above the law. If a national biometric ID was grandfathered into American society, E-Verify would not be needed as all workers could produce the federal picture ID card, swiped and authenticated. Business owners would have no excuse and then could be heavily fined or even go to prison for using illegal aliens. There would be as I have said, billions of dollars saved in overlapping programs and would go a long way in halting the illegal alien invasion. Many foreign nationals would say to themselves, why bother risking their lives in traipsing to the border and flying to America, when they have no chance of getting this biometric ID card. Even a stolen one would be useless, as they would not be registered in nationwide data base and would immediately red flag the business owner.
It is a sad situation when it comes to the fact that the politicians in Washington have apathetic attitude. They remain indifferent to the 23 million out of work, temporarily employed or just dropped out of the rat race and are instead kowtow to the illegal ethnic millions and their advocates, who think we should open the borders to everybody. They have made no effort to mandate E-Verify, but they have it seems intentionally overlook the birthright citizenship. This is the most costly part of the 14th amendment, which has been ingeniously manipulated by the left, which has attracted millions of pregnant foreigners with their unborn babies and children. Every year unknown numbers of smuggled children come to America or born to illegal aliens in this country and then claim citizenship. This intentional claim of citizenship is so costly that its revenue would pay at least  quarter towards running the United States military, because it generates expensive policies such as the DREAM ACT, FAMILY CHAIN MIGRATION, SANCTUARY CITIES AND ENCOURAGES MILLIONS OF ILLEGAL ALIENS TO TRY THEIR LUCK AT DODGING THE BORDER PATROL OR FLYING TO AMERICA AND OVERSTAYING THEIR VISAS.
ALL AMERICANS Should sign this petition against the Gang of Eight’s scheme and other detached lawmakers who are in disagreement with the 23 million unemployed Americans at: NumberUSA   If you really want your say counted write a note to your congressman (a screener will read it and tally up the letters ‘for’ and ‘against’) so you don’t have to hassle about being persuasive since all the congressman hears  about the amount of correspondence). Phone calls are better, but here you need to be rational and not an awkward tirade. YOU can also contact every Representative demanding no Amnesty and no Path to Citizenship at 202) 224-3121, which is the Central Washington switchboard. LEARN THE REALITY OF OUR BORDER AND INVESTIGATE THE CONCEALED NEWS AND REPORTS AT AMERICANPATROL.

Brandon Spencer, a suspect in the Halloween shooting that occurred near the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and  left four wounded, chose to withhold a plea on Wednesday during his preliminary hearing, where he was charged with four counts of attempted murder, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office.
During the preliminary hearing, the judge determined there was enough evidence to proceed to an arraignment. Spencer’s arraignment will be held on March 28. If convicted of the crime, Spencer could face life in prison.
Spencer, 20 and a non-USC student, was charged on Nov. 5, 2012 with four counts of attempted murder after he allegedly opened fire at an on-campus Halloween party that was hosted by the Black Student Assembly and promoted by LA Hype.
Deputy District Attorney Antonella Nistorescu from the Hardcore Gang Division is prosecuting the case. Attorney James Simmons is defending Spencer. Though Spencer did not enter a plea on Wednesday, he pled not guilty during his November arraignment, the Daily Trojan  reported Nov. 5. His bail was set at $2.04 million.
Los Angeles Police Department officers arrested two men on the night of the incident, but Spencer was the only one charged.
Though several hundred students attended the party, there were only four reports of people suffering from wounds. Geno Hall, a former football player at Crenshaw High School, was among the victims seriously injured in the shooting. Spencer allegedly shot him after the two men got in a verbal dispute.
Spencer, a security guard, is a resident of the Inglewood neighborhood, the Daily Trojan. reported Nov. 5. Simmons said he was scheduled to begin a nursing and EMT program at UCLA on Nov. 6, 2012.
After the shooting incident, the administration changed its security policy at the beginning of the spring 2013 semester. Students are now required to sign in visitors and present their IDs when entering campus between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m.

Olympian distance runner, World War II  hero and celebrated Alumnus Louis Zamperini spoke to a maximum capacity audience about the power of resilience.
Courage · USC alum Louis Zamperini speaks Wednesday at Bovard Auditorium about how his Olympic and POW experiences shaped his life. — Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
The event, entitled “The Great Zamperini: USC Trojan, Olympian and War Hero,”  was hosted by the Undergraduate Student Government, USC Spectrum and Program Board in conjuction with the Sol Price School of Public Policy, the Kappa Sigma Fraternity and the Student Alumni Society.
The second event of the Student Alumni Society’s 5 Traits of a Trojan Speaker Series focused on the Trojan trait of courage, and also included a performance by the Sol Price School of Public Policy color guard and a video introduction by Zamperini’s son, Luke.
Zamperini, who greeted the crowd of students, faculty and alumni sporting a cardinal and gold hat with his hands poised in the ‘fight on’ sign, spent the remainder of the evening sharing stories of his life, notably his 8th-place performance in the 1936 Berlin Olympics, his experience being stranded for 47 days after his aircraft crashed into the Japanese-controlled waters of the Pacific Ocean s and his survival as a Japanese prisoner of war during World War II.
Throughout the tales of his time in the Japanese prison camps, Zamperini described his two and a half year survival as a time of little hope.
“Every morning I woke up and expected that this was the day,” Zamperini said. ‘This is the day they’re going to kill us.”
Despite the serious tales of his life as a prisoner of war and his eventual rescue, Zamperini was not without humor.
“The mayor asked me if any good came out of being a prisoner of war in Japan,” Zamperini said. “I said, ‘Yeah, it prepared me for 55 years of married life.”
Zamperini recounted his post-war memories, from his assimilation to life after the war to his religious revitalization after listening to a talk by Christian evangelist Billy Graham. It was these same experiences that Zamperini recollected to encourage students to always be resilient.
“Life is full of problems,” Zamperini said. “Sometimes the problems are difficult, but you have to be resolute.”
When asked about how he survived his experiences in war, Zamperini recounted lessons his track coach taught him.
“You have to take the bull by the horns and fight ‘til the finish,” Zamperini said.
In closing, Zamperini reaffirmed his lifelong membership in the Trojan Family.
“I was in this room when I just got back from the war,” Zamperini said of Bovard Auditorium. “Wherever I go, people see my hat. I’m a Trojan though and through.”
Many students said the event reaffirmed their faith in the strength of the Trojan Family.
“Zamperini embodied every aspect about what I hope I will achieve in this lifetime,” said Kenneth Mang, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “This was an extraordinary opportunity, and I hope to have the chance to see him again.”
Jaideep Chadha, a junior majoring in business administration, said Zamperini’s return to the university at the age of 96 represents the strength and timelessness of the Trojan Family.
“His story is not only inspirational, but it shows how important the Trojan Family is and how much these connections matter,” Chadha said.
Student Alumni Society Co-Director Maheen Sahoo said Zamperini is a great example for Trojans everywhere.
“Louis Zamperini truly embodies what it means to be a Trojan and what it means to be one of the five traits — courageous,” Sahoo said. “I think we’re really lucky to have him here on our campus.”

Playing at home for the first time in more than two weeks, the USC women’s lacrosse team got off to a rough start against Temple. After fighting to an even score at halftime, they were unable to stop the Owls during the second half, giving up a 12-7 loss on Wednesday at McAlister Field in what initially looked like a low-scoring affair.
Up for grabs · Freshman midfielder Caroline Cordrey fights for position with Temple’s Charlotte Swavola during a loose-ball scramble. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Freshman midfield Amanda Johansen led the Women of Troy (4-5, 2-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) with three goals. Freshman attack Caroline de Lyra finished with three points (two goals, one assist), and freshman attack Caroline Cordrey added two goals of her own.
Rachel Schwaab led the Owls (5-1) with six points (three goals, three assists), while Charlotte Swavola and Stephany Parcell finished with three points each (two goals, one assist).
After giving up a pair of goals to Temple’s Kellee Pace and Schwaab, USC fought back to take a 3-2 lead behind unassisted goals from de Lyra, Johansen and Cordrey. Temple then tied the game with 10:38 left in the first half after Johansen earned a yellow card, but Johansen responded by giving USC the lead with 7:20 remaining. Temple again tied the game at 4-4 with a goal from Schwaab, and the score remained there at halftime.
“Our focus has been starting off stronger than we have been, so I was proud of the girls in the first half,” USC head coach Lindsey Munday said. “Even though we went down by a couple goals, I was glad to see us fight and just stay in it and chip away before halftime.”
Temple came out aggressively again in the second half, scoring three unanswered goals to take a 7-4 lead. Johansen scored her third goal of the game to stop the Owls’ run, but Temple scored again just 35 seconds later. The Owls controlled the game the rest of the way, outshooting USC 15-7 in the second half and leading by as many as six.
“We came out really strong and were working like a team in the first half,” Johansen said, “A few mistakes got the best of us, and they capitalized off of each mistake scoring goals, so they went up ahead. We needed a way to come back and score in bunches. We needed to win the draw control. We just made a few too many mistakes today, but we have to keep our heads up and look forward to our next game.”
Both teams turned the ball over 13 times, with USC causing 12 and Temple causing 10, but USC committed 22 fouls as opposed to just 12 for Temple. USC led 14-12 in ground balls, although Temple won the draw control battle 11-10.
“One thing that we can take away from today is just you got to battle all 60 minutes, and not just to show up the first half,” Cordrey said. “I think that we’re really going to use this to fuel us for our next game and come out really hard and compete for a full 60 minutes as a team together.”
USC plays one more game at McAlister Field against Marquette (2-3) at noon on Saturday before traveling for a pair of road games in Rhode Island. They take on Bryant University (2-3) at 1 p.m. on Tuesday, March 19, and Brown (4-1, 1-1 Ivy) at 2 p.m. on Friday, March 22.

Every year, across the country, the same thing happens: Schools hire a new head football coach or new assistants. Once spring practice starts, the new schemes and playbooks that each new coach brings are proclaimed to be so much better than those that came before.
Sure enough, early returns on new USC Defensive Coordinator Clancy Pendergast and his 5-2 defense are positive, and many are happily envisioning a 2013 season in which the spread offenses of other Pac-12 schools are utterly befuddled by Pendergast’s revolutionary new strategies.
But we’re smarter than that.
We know that, for the most part, the onus will be on both returning players and incoming freshmen to improve upon last season’s underwhelming performance, in which the Trojans finished fifth in the Pac-12 in scoring defense and seventh in total defense. Though these numbers were not awful, they definitely are not at the standard that should be expected of USC and its bevy of four- and five-star defensive recruits.
Though much will be made of Pendergast and his ability to “fix” the USC defense, whether or not that will be accomplished will mostly come as a result of returning players getting better and new players making an immediate impact.
For the former, the Trojans have a number of candidates. USC returns seven starters on the defensive side of the ball from a season ago, a group that does not include senior defensive end Devon Kennard, a starter from 2011 who missed all of last season because of injury. Each player had varying levels of success last year and all definitely have room for growth.
Chief among those who need to make the biggest leap is junior linebacker Lamar Dawson. Dawson was one of the most sought-after prep players in the country in 2011 and was given the honor of wearing jersey #55 in his first season on the team. The Kentucky native took over the starting role midway through his freshman season and started nine games last season, recording 77 tackles, good for fourth on the team.
But Dawson’s impact on defense has been a bit underwhelming. He has shown an inability to stand out, at least among fans, and has made few “big plays.” He recorded only two tackles behind the line of scrimmage last year and has just two interceptions and one forced fumble in his career.
To be blunt, much more was expected from Dawson when he arrived on campus. Injuries have played a part in his relative ineffectiveness. He’s dealt with an ankle sprain each of the last two seasons, but a large reason why USC’s defense faltered a year ago was because of Dawson’s failure to establish himself in the middle of the field, something that he will have to do this year if the defense is to make any significant strides.
Of course, there is always the possibility Dawson gets benched in favor of a more successful combination of linebackers. But at 6-foot-2 and 235 pounds, he has the potential to wreak havoc on opposing offenses, and the coaching staff would much rather have him earn playing time than get beaten out by someone else.
USC also has the luxury of several freshmen who can make an instant impact on the defensive side. The player that seems to be the leading candidate to play right away is defensive back Su’a Cravens. The versatile player has already received rave reviews from USC players and coaches alike during the first few spring practices of his career. He’s even drawn comparisons to former players Nickell Robey and Robert Woods, who started in the first game of their freshman seasons.
What makes Cravens’ expected impact even more exciting is that it will come in the secondary, an area in dire need for the 2013 Trojans. USC ranked sixth in the conference in pass-defense efficiency last year and must replace three starters: Robey and safeties T.J. McDonald and Jawanza Starling. The only returning player with any starting experience is defensive back Josh Shaw, a Florida transfer who has played both cornerback and safety.
Having Cravens step in right away would be huge, because the last thing the secondary needs is a revolving door situation at multiple positions, much like last year’s second cornerback spot. And with fellow freshman defensive back Leon McQuay III also standing out in the early going, it isn’t hard to envision a tandem of Cravens and McQuay as a mainstay on the backline for years to come.
Change for the sake of change is not a good thing, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the Trojans’ new 5-2 defensive scheme will hinder its performance next season. What it’s going to come down to is how all this amassed talent can gel together. And if returning and incoming players can create some semblance of synergy, then performances like last year’s awful Oregon game will be nothing but a distant, terrible memory.

Clancy’s success precedes him. He inherits some of the most highly-recruited players in the nation. The defense will be improved greatly! Fight on.

Clancy Pendergast sits in a classroom on the first floor of the John McKay Center on a recent Friday afternoon. It serves as a rather appropriate setting, considering the 45-year-old defensive coordinator has some teaching to do.
Looking up · USC Defensive Coordinator Clancy Pendergast has plenty of experience, including a yearlong stint with the Kansas City Chiefs. — Courtesy of Kansas City Star
 
His lesson plan, as he points out, includes instructing USC’s defense to be aggressive, swarm to the ball, tackle and force turnovers. The primary goal, he says, is simply “to get our guys to play fast.”
The checklist, of course, sounds a bit lengthy.
It’s extensive, if only because the Trojans have particularly struggled on that side of the ball in recent years. Just last season, the unit allowed 394 yards per game (ranking 60th nationally) and 24.3 points per game (40th nationally). Most glaringly, in a Nov. 3 home game against Oregon, they gave up 62 points and 730 yards — the most points and yards given up in a single game in school history. It appeared to epitomize everything that had gone wrong with the group since the turn of the decade: slow reacting, slow adjusting — just slow, mostly.
Not to mention two years earlier, in 2010, USC allowed, on average, 400 yards per game, the worst mark since the school first began tracking the statistic in the mid-1950s.
Pendergast shrugs it off. He isn’t interested in discussing the numbers, not at length and not on this day anyway. In his mind, it’s irrelevant.
“I had my own things going; I really didn’t look closely at what they did,” said Pendergast, who joined USC head coach Lane Kiffin’s staff on Jan. 18 after spending the last three seasons heading the defense at Cal. “I’m looking forward into the future and not back.”
What Pendergast and Kiffin hope the future holds is this: that USC can adjust to the rising number of Pac-12 teams utilizing spread offenses — an obstacle the outgoing Monte Kiffin, the team’s de facto defensive coordinator, seemingly could not overcome. Teams such as Arizona, Oregon and UCLA all moved the ball with relative ease against the Trojans last season, employing spread systems that produced touchdown upon touchdown.
“That’s what makes it so challenging to coach in the [Pac-12]: the diversity of offenses that you face,” Pendergast said. “That’s also one of the reasons I enjoy coaching in this league.”
So, at present, with USC in its second week of spring practice, Pendergast is emphasizing a revamped defense. The program is breaking away from its traditional 4-3 defensive front, which utilizes four defensive linemen combined with three linebackers, in favor of a 3-4 scheme as part of that adjustment geared toward stopping speed in space.
“It’s the way to go in this conference,” Kiffin said. “It’s why we made the change.”
The exact defensive installation so far revolves around a “5-2” defense, a variation of the 3-4 that moves two linebackers up and closer to the line of scrimmage. Call it an aggressive approach, less reactive compared to the famed “bend but don’t break” Tampa-2 system favored under Monte Kiffin.
Pendergast seems confident it’ll work.
“It’s multiple and it’s flexible to use the personnel that we have,” he explained.
He’s conveyed that message often in recent weeks. He emphasizes the personnel available and a willingness to play anyone at any age at any position — a link to USC’s defensive heyday in the mid-2000s under Pete Carroll, who frequently played underclassmen without a second thought.
“The game’s about the players,” Pendergast said. “I don’t know any coaches who have ever blocked or tackled or had an interception. It’s a player’s game. Regardless of the style of offense, we want the best guys out there.”
Players say they’ve warmed up to the approach.
“He demands a lot out of the whole unit,” redshirt junior safety Josh Shaw said. “That’s what you want out of your [defensive] coordinator. Like I said, he’s hands-on. We’ve definitely responded well to him.”
Pendergast also quickly cites his resume, which serves as a sign he can fix the Trojans’ ailments. During his first season with Cal, the Golden Bears jumped from seventh to first in the then-Pac-10 in total defense. And in 2008, as the defensive coordinator for the Arizona Cardinals, Pendergast led his unit to fifth in the NFL in takeaways with 30 en route to a run to Super Bowl XLIII — a testament to his aggressive scheme.
“The guy has a lot of insight,” Shaw added. “His knowledge is unbelievable.”
For USC to bounce back in 2013, the team’s best hope is that his knowledge is as good as advertised.

USC women’s basketball coach Michael Cooper has resigned from his position, USC Athletic Director Pat Haden announced Wednesday.
The news comes after Cooper led the Women of Troy to an 11-20 overall record and a 7-11 mark in Pac-12 play in 2013, which was good enough for seventh place in the conference. The team did not qualify for postseason play in 2013.
“This program has to move forward, and it should have moved forward under my leadership. The best thing is for me to step down,” Cooper said in a statement. “I really want to thank the administration here at USC. Pat Haden and [Senior Associate Athletic Director] Donna Heinel and everyone have been very supportive. Coaching these young women at USC has been a wonderful experience for me. I wish nothing but the best for USC and the women’s basketball program.”
Cooper, who was a five-time NBA champion as a player with the Los Angeles Lakers, caps his four-year career with the Trojans with a 72-57 record, good for a winning percentage of .558. In 2011, he led the Women of Troy all the way to the WNIT title game, where the team lost to Toledo. USC’s last NCAA tournament appearance was in 2006, when the Trojans held an 18-11 record before reaching the second round of the tournament.
Before coming to USC, Cooper coached the WNBA’s Los Angeles Sparks for eight seasons, where he boasted a 187-97 record and two WNBA championships, including a coach of the year honor in 2000.
“We appreciate the service and effort Michael Cooper provided while coaching our women’s basketball team, and we wish him well,” Haden said. “USC women’s basketball has a storied heritage, with national championship teams and some of the best players in the history of the sport. We believe we should be competing for Pac-12 championships and NCAA bids on a consistent basis. We will conduct a search to find the right person to help us do that.”
The last two seasons were particularly disappointing for the women’s basketball program. After the WNIT run in 2011, the Women of Troy entered the 2011-12 season ranked No. 23 in the preseason with hopes of returning to the NCAA tournament. But a tough nonconference schedule proved to be daunting, and a first-round exit in the Pac-12 tournament dashed any hopes at a postseason run.
After losing  guards Jacki Gemelos and Briana Gilbreath to the 2012 WNBA Draft, as well as guard Ashley Corral to graduation, expectations were lowered slightly for the 2012-13 season. But the team still received votes in this year’s preseason polls and had hopes of a strong season. Unfortunately, the team never found its stride and scuffled to a second consecutive poor season.
Goodbye and good luck being far away from the WOT basketball program. Doubt Cooper really resigned
getting a good severance to leave gracefully. Hopefully Haden will make a better than good choice for the new coach.

After storming back from a 13-point deficit in the final nine minutes, the USC men’s basketball team found themselves trailing 69-66 with the ball and only eight seconds remaining.
Closing time · In his last collegiate game, senior point guard Jio Fontan scored six points and dished out seven assists in USC’s season-ending 69-66 loss to Utah in the opening round of the Pac-12 tournament. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Senior forward Eric Wise threw an outlet pass to sophomore guard Byron Wesley, but Wesley fumbled shortly after gaining possession. The final buzzer sounded before either team could regain possession, sealing the win for the Utes and ending the Trojans’ season.
“I thought we were getting ready to have a really good look,” USC interim head coach Bob Cantu said. “It worked out how we wanted it to defensively, but we weren’t able to get a shot attempt.”
USC’s final opportunity to tie the game came after Cantu elected not to foul Utah with just a five-second differential between the shot clock and game clock. Utah’s Jarred DuBois missed a jumper with nine seconds left to give the ball back to the Trojans, but USC was unable to take advantage.
The Trojans finish with a 14-18 record on the year, a record skewed by arguably the nation’s toughest schedule but one still indicative of progress made from last year. The Trojans improved their win total by eight from their 6-26 campaign in 2011-12 and won nine Pac-12 games after winning just one last year.
“We weren’t able to get stops at key points in the game,” Cantu said. “We made great runs and cut [the lead] down, and then they would hit a good shot or DuBois would get to the rim and score a layup.”
In the absence of junior forward Dewayne Dedmon, who led the Trojans in rebounds and blocks this season, junior center Omar Oraby received the start and played his finest game of the season and perhaps his career. Oraby led USC with 18 points on 8-of-11 shooting to go along with 10 rebounds and had two critical 3-point plays down the stretch to fuel the Trojans’ comeback effort. Oraby played a career-high 35 minutes, far surpassing his previous high of 26, and committed just one foul up until the final minute, when USC fouled the Utes while playing catch-up.
Still, the absence of Dedmon and senior center James Blasczyk, were suspended indefinitely following a report of USC basketball players’ involvement in a fight in downtown Spokane, Wash. last Sunday morning, was evident, even if the USC players wouldn’t say so.
“We prepared without them, so we were prepared to win without them,” senior point guard Jio Fontan said. “We just didn’t put it through. Utah did a good job.”
Junior guard J.T. Terrell had 14 points and six rebounds for the Trojans, while Wise had 12 points and nine rebounds in a game that resulted in a postgame locker-room scene full of tears and disbelief.
“I’m disappointed in myself,” Wise said. “People look at you to make shots. When you don’t do that, you have to live with that.”
It looked like the Trojans’ season was coming to an ugly end when Utah’s Jordan Loveridge hit a 3-pointer to put the Utes up 60-47 with 8:33 to go. After 30 minutes of sloppiness and a lack in communication, the Trojans looked finished. They weren’t.
Wise scored seven points to ignite a 12-0 run that cut the deficit to 60-59 with 3:46 to go. A pair of clutch jumpers by DuBois helped put Utah back up by six with 1:57 to go, but a layup by Wesley and an incredible 30-footer by Terrell made it 69-66 with 41 seconds left. The Trojans’ defense held steady on the final Utes possession but simply could not control the ball when it mattered most, fumbling away their final chance to complete the comeback.
Now Cantu can walk out the door holding hands with Cooper to end this downward spiral in basketball.

If ever the Trojans needed home-field advantage, now is the time.
USC baseball has dropped six of its last seven games (with its most recent against Pepperdine Tuesday) and has dipped to two games below .500 at 7-9.
Tuesday’s game against the Waves was supposed to offer a battle-worn Trojan team a brief respite from a tough schedule that pitted them against four ranked teams in their last five games.
While the Trojans fared well in a 2-1 win over the then-ranked No.10 Oklahoma Sooners and their top pitching prospect, ultimately this last stretch has been a woeful tale of bullpen inconsistencies and hitters being too tense in the batter’s box with runners on base.
And the team is not about to catch any breaks in the near future. This weekend, they play at home against No. 12 Oregon to kick off conference play.
USC head coach Dan Hubbs said the problem is all in his players’ heads.
“It’s about where they are mentally, more than physically,” he said. “When you start to see them doubt themselves and struggle with that, it makes it more difficult.”
As of late, it’s the pitching staff that has taken a shock to its confidence. In the team’s last six losses, the Trojans’ bullpen has surrendered 27 runs, putting even more pressure on a lineup that’s pressing at the plate and struggling to score.
But junior starting pitcher Bobby Wheatley said that despite their recent slump, he’ll never lose faith in his teammates and that he understands the difficulties that this bullpen, comprised primarily of freshmen, is going through.
“This could be the first time that they’ve ever really failed,” Wheatley said. “Coming from high school, they’re used to being successful. I’ve been there before, getting your first taste of failure.”
Hubbs acknowledges that his young players are still acclimating to a cruel learning curve, but said that players need to remember that not everybody takes collegiate baseball by storm as a freshman. He insisted that this is an opportunity for them to mature as players and learn from losing.
“That’s part of growing up as a baseball player,” Hubbs said. “You have to have this attitude where you forget your failures and just remember your successes.”
Even if the root of the problem is internal, the result manifests itself in pitchers losing their command of the ball, missing the zone and giving up free bases.
“It’s all about strike one,” sophomore catcher Garrett Stubbs said. “If they get ahead in the count then they have control of the batter. Right now, we’re getting behind in the count.”
Giving up walks has been the pitchers’ pitfall, but being unable to take them is an equally important problem for hitters. Hubbs said that at a time when the team is trying to do too much with a bat to compensate for missed opportunities, getting bases on balls can help players turn their slump around.
“They look at a walk sometimes as a weakness instead of a free base but it doesn’t go against your average,” Hubbs said. “Instead, they force their swing and they get themselves out.”
The Trojans need to worry less about the long ball and focus more on small ball and scrappy play: being patient at the plate, fouling off pitches and not caving in to balls they can’t hit. Aside from being a blow to a box score, Hubbs worries that the “go big or go home” mentality might affect the way his players approach the game.
“Sometimes I worry they take it too seriously,” Hubbs said. “I want them to be passionate about winning but at the end of the day, they have to understand it’s a game and be able to play with relaxed freedom, the way they’ve been doing it since they were five.”
Wheatley takes the mound for the Trojans on Friday, and he said that he is looking forward to using conference play as a way of helping the team reshape its focus and live up to its potential.
“We can play with any team if we show up,” Wheatley said. “The next step for us is showing up every day and having our play on the field be consistent.”
This next stretch will test whether the freshmen can pick themselves up and dust themselves off or if the growing pains are going to hurt a little bit longer.

With spring break quickly approaching, many Trojans will shelve their difficult course material in favor of a trashy beach read. As they dig their toes into the sand and try to forget about the stress of midterm hell, enjoying a mindless bestseller seems like the perfect way to take a break from hardcore literary analysis and just appreciate a good story.
For me, deciding what to read on vacation is just as difficult as settling on spring break plans. Should I pick up a dense literary classic like Edith Wharton’s Age of Innocence and try to broaden my horizons? Or should I just curl up with Janet Evanovich’s One for the Money, a witty crime fiction novel that saw a 2012 film release with Katherine Heigl?
The problem ultimately arises when book lovers attempt to define “great literature.” With the constant pressure to expand our minds and challenge ourselves, sometimes we forget that novels written solely for entertainment can be just as valuable as political literary works.
It’s not our fault that we struggle to balance the two. After all, we’ve been taught that we should focus our energies on so-called “classic literature” and snub trashy novels that won’t improve our satisfactory SAT or GRE scores.
When looking at high school and college book lists across the United States, it’s easy to notice recurring trends among required readings. George Orwell’s 1984. Ernest Hemingway’s The Sun Also Rises. Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man. We’re taught to value stories with profound themes and highbrow subject matter — and authors like Evanovich just don’t make the cut.
Yet, we almost rarely channel our literary energies into these sorts of texts alone. Most high school students were exposed to J.D. Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye or F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, yet also managed to make time to read J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series or Dan Brown’s The Lost Symbol. Similarly, reading Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights or Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations might be mandatory for some college-level English classes, yet college students still find time to relax and enjoy recent bestsellers such as Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl and Ian McEwan’s Sweet Tooth.
But as bibliophiles attempt to strike a balance between reading intellectually and reading for pleasure, the boundaries surrounding “classic literature” become significantly blurred. Though it would seem that some literary works are a permanent fixture in the English literary canon, others become a bit more difficult to place — whether or not they warrant a mention on required reading lists. After all, a significant portion of today’s generation considers Rowling’s Harry Potter series mandatory reading for anyone who wishes to understand contemporary Western culture, but literary scholars stand divided on the issue.
“We can’t avoid the fact that Harry Potter is the main narrative experience of an entire generation — the children who quite literally grew up with Harry Potter,” John Patrick Pazdziora, a doctoral candidate at the University of St. Andrews told The Telegraph. “The Harry Potter novels are simply the most important and influential children’s books of the late-twentieth and early-twenty-first centuries.”
Indeed, Pazdziora was so passionate about the Potter series that he organized a nearly 50-lecture conference built around Harry Potter at St. Andrews last May. Other scholars, however, take the opposite viewpoint and find no literary merit in Rowling’s series.
“J.K. Rowling may be a great storyteller, but she’s no Shakespeare,” wrote Telegraph reporter Sarah Rainey in an article discussing scholarly attitudes toward Harry Potter. “Her books, though enthralling, weren’t written for academic study. It’s an injustice to Britain’s true literary greats to pretend otherwise.”
But what makes a piece of fiction “classic literature”? Should we define literary merit by how quickly a book puts us to sleep? All joking aside, allowing a privileged minority to define “good literature” proves highly problematic, especially considering that much of the Western world hasn’t read what some scholars consider staples of literary culture. (Even Mark Twain defined a “classic” as “something that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read.”)
More importantly, relying on the “literary elite” doesn’t always pay off at the time of a novel’s publication. After all, much of what we define as “classic literature” today was met with poor critical reviews when first released. The Catcher in the Rye might have received praise from The New York Times during its publication in 1951, but other outlets found Holden Caulfield’s voice in the novel whiney and overly pessimistic. Brontë’s Wuthering Heights went largely ignored by the reading public and received mixed reviews at its 1847 release. Similarly, Jane Austen only rose to popularity after her death in 1817.
Perhaps what’s most important, then, is making an emotional connection with the stories we read, whether that connection is prompted by Rowling’s Harry Potter or Toni Morrison’s Beloved.
“What really knocks me out is a book that, when you’re all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it,” says Holden Caulfield in Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye. “That doesn’t happen much, though.”
This spring break, try following Caulfield’s philosophy. Read for pleasure without worrying about a novel’s critical reception or about improving your vocabulary. Always wanted to try 50 Shades of Grey? Go for it. Sick of trying to tackle War and Peace? Don’t beat yourself up too much.
After all, even the most studious intellectuals need a break.

When advertising for The Call picked up earlier this year, viewers most likely rolled their eyes and groaned at what looked like the latest unremarkable addition to the thriller genre.
Dial M for Murder · Unlike her most recent film Movie 43, Halle Berry revists her dramatic roots in The Call, playing operator Jordan Turner who struggles to track down an infamous killer before he claims his next victim. — Courtesy of Greg Gayne
Flaunting a serial killer plot and superstar Halle Berry in the lead role, The Call initially seemed like Hollywood’s attempt to capitalize on the success of former suspense hits, such as The Silence of the Lambs or American Psycho.
But then something unexpected happens. As soon as the film plays its intense phone call audio over the opening credits, viewers are catapulted into the buzzing world of Jordan Turner (Halle Berry) and what’s informally known as “the hive,” an office where fire, medical and police emergency hotlines meet at 911 help desks.
The Call follows Jordan’s intense but satisfying life as she balances a relationship with co-worker Officer Paul Phillips (Morris Chestnut) with the grueling demands of her job. When a careless blunder results in the death of a young 911 caller, Jordan tries to trace down a mysterious serial killer (Michael Eklund) before he can commit his next murder.
The 96-minute film juggles themes of guilt and responsibility alongside its gritty premise and flinch-worthy images. Audiences certainly get their fair share of R-rated violence and suspense-genre conventions, but The Call’s script also explores darker topics, such as how we handle the moments before we die and how we live with the consequences of our actions. Still, the balancing act doesn’t seem too difficult for Berry and the rest of the cast.
Berry easily steps into the role of the tough, yet vulnerable, operator with her emotive facial expressions and seemingly effortless screen presence. As she cuddles with her boyfriend, delivers a series of orders to trainees and coaches 911 callers through life-and-death situations, audiences recognize that Jordan is completely three dimensional, brought to life by Berry’s thorough understanding of the character. Though The Call is not her heaviest role, the Oscar winner reminds audiences that she’s not the sort of actress who relies on her pretty face alone.
But the supporting cast members hold their own alongside Berry’s believable performance. Chestnut and Berry shine in their few moments onscreen together, giving off a tangible chemistry that defines their relationship in record time. Abigail Breslin brings audiences to tears with her full-fledged desperation in the trunk of the murderer’s car. Eklund’s Michael Foster, terrifies with detached facial expressions, unnatural posture and bizarre mannerisms to match his character’s unhinged mental state.
For the first two acts, The Call’s cast and script drive the film emotionally as well as tonally. Audiences get attached to the charming characters while also questioning whether they will survive a series of unfortunate events that quickly diminish their chances of survival.
That being said, it soon becomes obvious that The Call is a genre piece. The emotional authenticity of the film eventually gets lost among trite plot devices that leave frustrated viewers yelling at the screen. But according to the filmmakers, such artistic choices were completely intentional.
“We wanted to find a way to elevate genre movies,” said producer Michael Helfant at a March 8 screening of the film at the USC Eileen Norris Cinema Theatre. “I think we really accomplished that on this one.”
Helfant’s completely right when it comes to the first production from Troika Pictures, the almost 4-year-old production company founded by Helfant, Robert Stein and Bradley Gallo. Based on the principle of financing, producing and distributing commercial films for specific audiences, Troika succeeds in paying homage to the forms of the suspense genre while also creating something refreshing and honest. The Call might provoke laughter from audiences annoyed with characters who lack basic common sense, yet it also remains completely self-aware, as it tackles familiar ground.
The serial killer premise and Jordan’s final underground encounter with Michael call to mind Jodie Foster and Ted Levine in The Silence of the Lambs. But the film’s surprise ending rewards audiences by defying their expectations for the thriller genre; The Call’s final scene more than makes up for hackneyed moments where Berry drops her cell phone into Michael’s lair or decides to go in after him without police backup.
“It seems to be nervous laughter or groans that she’s going down there,” said writer Richard D’Ovidio when prompted to address the audience’s laughter during the film’s more ridiculous moments. He later added: “You’re engaged and you’re experiencing the film, and that’s a good thing.”
The Call also excels stylistically. With School of Cinematic Arts alum Avi Youabian taking the helm as editor, the film flaunts a cohesive tone that complements D’Ovidio’s clean script. Youabian has no trouble providing insights into both Jordan’s guilt-ridden conscience and Michael’s twisted mind, as he carefully weaves together Tom Yatsko’s cinematography.
He succeeds most, however, in his handling of sound in the film. Youabian and The Call’s sound design team layer 911 phone call audio over city montages, add the distant humming of bees behind the chatter of the hive’s emergency operators and carefully blend Breslin’s screams over Berry’s gentle voice.
“[We really wanted] the sound design to be a character in the film,” Youabian said.
From the stellar cast performances to the fast-moving script, The Call takes viewers on a suspenseful thrill ride through both familiar and unfamiliar territory. Though the film certainly has its flaws, it holds its own as one of the better interpretations of the suspense genre.
It’s too bad it’s over before you realize it — some viewers won’t quite be ready to leave the edge of their seats as the credits roll.
But as Berry says in her final one-liner: “It’s already done.”

Institutions of higher education should be allowed to monitor the potentially illegal activities of its students and staff.
In this age of technology, questions of security and privacy are in constant motion. Unfortunately, the Internet is far too vast of a wasteland to truly enforce and guarantee full privacy — and one should not expect such privacy in the first place.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
This issue was clearly relevant during a cheating scandal that took place at Harvard College in 2012. Last September, the prestigious school of higher education revealed that a massive plagiarism scandal had taken place the semester before. According to CNN, more than 100 students in “Government 1310: Introduction to Congress” were asked to withdraw from the university for a period of time, suspended or faced other disciplinary actions from the university after faculty noticed similarities between many take-home final exams.
The scandal was supposed to have wrapped up with that. But this past Monday, Deans Michael D. Smith and Evelynn M. Hammonds released a statement saying that the college’s IT department had been instructed to search through the email accounts of resident deans in order to see if anyone had disclosed a confidential document regarding the cheating scandal.
According to the statement, “No one’s e-mails were opened and the contents of no one’s e-mails were searched by human or machine.”
Yes, an email search of any kind could be considered troubling to some. Yet many do not realize the implications of possible leaks of confidential information in any sort of carefully run organization.
If a resident dean were found to be at fault, then the college would be able to rid itself of a faculty member who would not be able to follow the policies the college wants to maintain. But since the search ended in administrators discovering that a resident dean had merely forwarded the confidential document unintentionally, many are up in arms over the situation.
The truth of the matter is this: Harvard has every right to search the email accounts of its faculty and students since these account addresses end with an “@harvard.edu.” These accounts are owned by Harvard University and given to its faculty and students as a privilege, not a right.
“Why not tell people you are reading their e-mail? Would it not be the honorable thing to do?” Harry Lewis, the Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science and the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Computer Science at the university, posted on his blog.
In order to catch the possible culprit, however, secrecy was key. What was to stop a resident dean from deleting guilty emails from his or her account once he or she got wind of the search?
School email accounts can be used for personal purposes, and many are. But in the end, these accounts are owned by the institution that bestowed them upon its students and faculty.
If one feels that their rights have been infringed upon, then our expectations are widely delusional.
Sheridan Watson is a junior majoring in critical studies. She is also the Editorial Director of the Daily Trojan.
 
Searching through active personal university email accounts is an extreme breach of ethics and trust. 
On the extent of the breach, the fact that Harvard stopped at the subject line is still frightening. This callous disregard for privacy shows the extent to which Harvard will monitor its own administrators to investigate an internal problem, according to CNN. It also begs another question: If Harvard had not found the leak based on the search of the email subject lines, would they have actually read the contents of each email? At what point was Harvard going to engage in legal and ethical investigative techniques and stop violating the privacy of its faculty?
The fact that Harvard did this to administrators is also frightening for a few other reasons. Foremost, if this is how Harvard treats the administrative faculty, then how does Harvard treat other professors? Lecturers without tenure? Staff? Students? If Harvard is willing to scan the email of its best and brightest faculty, then no email account at Harvard is safe.
This is a dangerous precedent for the school to set. Everyone pretty much wants their privacy, and Harvard’s actions are a severe breach of trust. If a school gives faculty and administrators job security through mutual trust, they can be much more effective instructors and leaders. But if professors have to start worrying about what they write in an email, then the concept of tenure is moot.
With this breach in privacy, however, faculty could feel like they have to worry about what they are saying, to whom they are speaking and how they are saying it because the administration is willing to read their emails to single them out for punishment. In this hypothetical situation, Harvard becomes unable to function as a legitimate educational institution.
Harvard should have never read the emails of deans, nor should Harvard ever endeavor to engage in such activity ever again. Hopefully Harvard can learn from its mistakes and become a respected representative of American higher education.

Fifty-three years ago, Alfred Hitchcock chilled moviegoers with the release of Psycho, one of the only horror films to make it onto the American Film Institute’s top-100 list, Psycho tells the story of an attractive 30-something secretary who steals a lump sum of money from a prominent client and then leaves town. Her decision to stop at the Bates Motel is when the trouble begins. There, she encounters Norman Bates. Unbeknownst to her, beneath Norman’s friendly all-American facade lies a killer with a disturbing attachment to his long-deceased mother. Since the film’s release, the character of Norman Bates has inspired a cult-like following, prompting three sequels which delve into the past of one of the most iconic killers in cinema history. Over the years, however, fans have remained puzzled by questions about the dark secrets of Norman’s youth.
To the delight of horror fans old and new, more of Norman’s past comes to light on March 18, when A&E Network will air Bates Motel, a Psycho-inspired television series that follows the day-to-day struggles of 17-year-old Norman Bates (Freddie Highmore) and his mother, Norma Louise Bates (Vera Farmiga). Bates Motel documents the family’s move to White Pine Bay, a serene, utopian town on the Oregon coast. There they buy a secluded motel in an attempt to start their lives over. But as the Bates family begins to settle in, they find themselves incapable of leaving old habits behind when they discover that the residents of their new hometown also have a few skeletons in their closets.
Farmiga seems to be a wise casting selection, as the actress has experience playing the mother of a bad seed. Previously, she played Isabelle Furhman’s mother in the 2009 film Orphan and Jacob Kogan’s mother in the 2007 film Joshua. Farmiga is also a real-life mother of two and will be able to bring her personal understanding of the unbreakable bond between mother and child to the role of Norma Bates.
Though the selection of Highmore to play Norman comes as a surprise to some (the role is a big jump from Highmore’s most well-known role, the innocent Charlie Bucket in Tim Burton’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) it is likely that the boyish innocence Highmore projects might very well have drawn producers to him. With his youthful face and socially awkward mannerisms, his behavior resembles that of Anthony Perkins, who played Norman in Hitchcock’s Psycho.
Nestor Carbonell, who plays the town sheriff on the new show, said the exploration of Norman’s childhood is exciting because it incorporates details of the film series, but manages to have its own distinct voice.
“It’s an incredible re-imagining of the original Psycho,” Carbonell said in a Behind the Scenes A&E Network video.
For executive producer Kerry Ehrin, it was important to show that beyond the bloody mother-son bonding activities and the incestuous nature of Norman and Norma’s relationship, the pair has a relationship that has many genuine, human qualities and experiences — experiences that can be found in any parent-child relationship.
“What parent doesn’t, on some level, want to hang onto their kid as long as possible?” Ehrin wrote on AETV.com. “What kid doesn’t want to have their mother’s complete devotion and approval somewhere along the line?”
Another interesting detail about the plot is that the story will take place in the present — in an age where everyone owns a smartphone with 911 on speed dial — rather than during the 1950s when, if following the Hitchcock timeline, Norman Bates would have been a young boy.
“Bates Motel shouldn’t play it like ‘Norman Bates with an iPhone.’ Modern technology devices should be used in the series as throw-away props, not something to focus the characters into this modern day setting,” said Michael Breiburg, a former film editor at Bischoff Hervey Entertainment.
The premiere episode of Bates Motel, titled “First You Dream, Then You Die,” airs on A&E Network on Monday, March 18 at 10 p.m.. So, hurry to your televisions ­— it’s almost check-in time.

USC athletic director Pat Haden announced Wednesday that USC women’s basketball coach Michael Cooper has resigned from his position. This comes after Cooper led the Women of Troy to an 11-20 overall record this season, and a 7-11 mark in Pac-12 play, good enough for seventh place in the conference. The team did not qualify for postseason play in 2013.
“This program has to move forward, and it should have moved forward under my leadership. The best thing is for me to step down,” Cooper said to USCTrojans.com. “I really want to thank the administration here at USC. Pat Haden and Donna Heinel and everyone have been very supportive. Coaching these young women at USC has been a wonderful experience for me. I wish nothing but the best for USC and the women’s basketball program.”
Cooper, who was a five-time NBA champion as a player with the Los Angeles Lakers, caps his four-year career with the Trojans with a 72-57 record, good for a winning percentage of .558. In 2011, he led the Women of Troy all the way to the WNIT title game, where the team lost to Toledo. USC’s last NCAA tournament appearance was in 2006, when the Trojans held an 18-11 record before reaching the second round of the tournament.
Before coming to USC, Cooper coached the WNBA’s Los Angeles Sparks for eight seasons, where he boasted a 187-97 record and 2 WNBA championships, including a coach of the year honor in 2000.
“We appreciate the service and effort Michael Cooper provided while coaching our women’s basketball team, and we wish him well,” said USC athletic director Pat Haden. “USC women’s basketball has a storied heritage, with national championship teams and some of the best players in the history of the sport.  We believe we should be competing for Pac-12 championships and NCAA bids on a consistent basis.  We will conduct a search to find the right person to help us do that.”
The last two seasons were particularly disappointing for the women’s basketball program.  After the WNIT run in 2011, the Women of Troy entered the 2011-12 season ranked No. 23 in the preseason with hopes of returning to the NCAA tournament.  But a tough nonconference schedule proved to be daunting, and a first-round exit in the Pac-12 tournament dashed any hopes at a postseason run.
After losing two players — guards Jacki Gemelos and Briana Gilbreath — to the 2012 WNBA draft, as well as guard Ashley Corral to graduation, expectations were lowered slightly for the 2012-13 season.  But the team still received votes in this year’s preseason polls and had hopes of strong season.  Unfortunately, the team never found its stride and scuffled to an 11-20 record.
