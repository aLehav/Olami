Jerry Papazian graduated in 1977 with a bachelor of arts degree in economics and went on to earn his master of business administration and law degree from UCLA. Papazian served as a member of the Board of Trustees from 1994-1999 and as president of the Alumni Association from 1995-1996. Papazian is currently the vice president of corporate finance at Bear, Stearns & Co, Inc.

Daily Trojan: During your time at USC, how important were extracurricular activities for you?
 
Jerry Papazian: While I was in school I was involved in student government. I was a student senator. I was also chairman of Songfest my senior year. I was very involved in my fraternity as well. There are so many more things you can get involved in now then there were when I attended USC.
 
DT: What was the most influential thing you did or learned at USC to get you where you are today?
 
Papazian: Joan Schaefer, affectionately know as Dean Joan, was dean of women. Dean Joan had an advisory role and she probably impacted my life and the lives of thousands of USC students over the years. She was a person who encouraged you to go out there and take full advantage of university life, and to get to know faculty. She is still alive and turning 90 next month. She still comes to the campus one day a week.
In the fraternity, I learned to work with 70-80 guys. That was a good experience for the business world. In student government, I learned about politics. With songfest, I learned about how powerful communication could be. It all paid off in life later on.
 
DT: Would you encourage students to take that same path and get involved with things outside of academics?
 
Papazian: Now is the chance to learn and experiment and see what your passions are. So get involved with as many things as you can handle and look around and look in places where you wouldn’t have looked before. My favorite class ironically was an art history class I took freshman year. Where did that come from, I have no idea? To this day, it was my favorite course.
 
DT: I noticed you received your MBA from UCLA. How was that switch and why did you decide to come back to USC since you are  an alumnus of both schools?
 
Papazian: People will tell you that your heart will always belong to your undergraduate institution. That is true with me. I have been and always will be a Trojan at heart.
 
DT: What has been your most fond memory of USC since graduating in 1977?
 
Papazian: Right after 1977, when I graduated, I never stopped. At age 40, I was selected to be president of the Alumni Association but then, also as a result, I became a member of the Board of Trustees. That was probably the most rewarding experience being able to give back to the whole university like that as a trustee.
 
DT: What is one last piece of advice you would give to the current students of USC?
 
Papazian: Go out there and get involved and learn about everything that is out there while you are still young and have the opportunity. You will start working and you will have less time to experience and learn. I would trade it in a second to go back and be 20 years old again and have all those opportunities.
 
DT: How are you currently involved in the school and what do you see for your future?
 
Papazian: My primary role is on the Board of Counselors for the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences. In that role I have been working and continuing to work on scholarships for students. It is actually in the name of Dean Joan Schaaffer. One big role is raising money for and awarding scholarships to students in the college. I am also a member of the leadership council for the Armenian Institute. In that I am working with the Shoah Foundation to bring a collection of interviews of survivors of the Armenian Genocide. The foundation was started by Steven Spielberg. He founded it around 15 years ago and gave it to USC to run recently. They have Holocaust survivors’ interviews. I’m working on bringing the Armenian Genocide to that space.
It can be harder as an undergrad to get into a USC graduate program.  USC wants to continue to grow its alumni base.  That goal isn’t served by giving a grad student spot to someone who’s already an undergrad alum.
Tell him to go hang with the ‘ruins. Obviously not qualified to continue his education at USC after being an under-graduate with a foot in the door.
I say give the Armenian Genocide stories to the Shoah Foundation!  Also tell them about that Hitler quote, that is important too!

The Keck School of Medicine will no longer have a combined Baccalaureate/M.D. Program for incoming freshmen next fall after being the only such program in California.
The program, which gave entering freshmen guaranteed acceptance into the medical school upon receiving their bachelor’s degree, was canceled so more students could have access to heath-related issues, according to Karen Rowan-Badger, assistant dean of USC Dornsife Admission.
“We have now progressed to our ultimate goal of opening a comprehensive Dornsife-Keck Pre-Health Services Center, which provides involvement opportunities and advisement for all of our pre-health students, rather than just a few selected students,” Rowan-Badger said.
The Office of the Provost, USC Dornsife Dean Howard Gillman and Keck School of Medicine Dean Carmen Puliafito jointly made the decision after years of close analysis and preparation, Rowan-Badger said.
Students currently enrolled in the program will continue on the same course plan until their guaranteed admission to Keck in fall 2015.
The Dornsife-Keck Pre-Health Services Center, which opened last year, will replace the services the Baccalaureate/M.D. Program previously provided.
Keck eliminated the combined degree when it found the program corresponded with a loss of diversity of majors and uniqueness among its applicants.
“The original design for the program was to encourage current undergraduate students to explore non-traditional majors for their pre-health education and broaden their understanding of the liberal arts,” Rowan-Badger said.
After a careful evaluation of the program, however, the university decided the creation of the Dornsife-Keck Pre-Heath Service Center was a more effective way to increase academic diversity among medical school applicants.
The university will now aim to increase the diversity of majors among applicants and strengthen the undergraduate experience for students interested in pursuing medicine with the Pre-Health Services Center, Rowan-Badger said.
Jessica Gonzalez, a sophomore majoring in gerontology and a current student in the program, said she is especially disappointed with how the change will affect future freshmen.
“Incoming students may feel that they missed out on an incredible opportunity to have a guaranteed acceptance into medical school,” Gonzalez said.
Gonzalez also said she thinks the cancellation will cause a loss of community among students.
Some students, including Jeffrey Hill, a senior majoring in biology and kinesiology, found the program was helpful in allowing students to explore academic fields outside of health and science.
“The Baccalaureate/M.D. Program was a great opportunity for qualified and aspiring medically minded undergrads to get the most out of their college experience,” Hill said. “The comfort of already being accepted into medical school provides the chance for those admitted into the program to pursue things they might not have otherwise.”
The new center will continue to provide the small-group atmosphere and facilitate the common coursework of the Baccalaureate/M.D. Program, Rowan-Badger said.
Rowan-Badger said Keck expects to see backlash from students surrounding the program’s termination.
“We are certainly anticipating some unhappiness since we no longer offer this program,” Rowan-Badger said. “However, if students are truly interested in studying medicine at USC Dornsife, we know the improvements and focus will allow more students to become better prepared for medical school.”
No decision has been made regarding the new Dornsife-Keck Pre-Health Services Center affecting a program of early acceptance to Keck.

After serving as a hybrid facility for both students and hotel guests, the Radisson Hotel is no longer being offered as a freshman housing option.
Housing · For the first time since 2001, the Radisson Hotel will no longer serve as a dormitory for students but will continue to host hotel guests. - Mindy Curtis | Daily Trojan
Since fall 2001, the Radisson on Figueroa Street has devoted four floors to house mainly freshman and a few transfer students because of a lack of adequate bed space elsewhere. New housing built in recent years with adequate facilities and amenities to meet the needs of students has largely influenced the decision to end student housing at the Radisson.
“The situation has changed dramatically,” said Michael Jackson, vice president of student affairs.  “The university built the second residential college at Parkside Arts & Humanities and private developers have constructed several thousand beds on Figueroa [street] adjacent to campus.”
For students who are past residents of the Radisson, opinions are mixed.
“I’m kind of sad,” said Nicole Chau, a senior majoring in neuroscience and East Asian languages and cultures who lived in the Radisson as a freshman. “A lot of people thought you don’t get the dorm experience there. But I met a lot of my friends there, and we formed our own  community.”
Mateo Epshteyn, a senior majoring in business, explained, although there were upsides to living at the Radisson, including nicer living accommodations versus other dorms like New/North, starting out college life in a hotel had its drawbacks.
“As far as transitioning to college, it’s not the kind of experience people expected,” Epshteyn said. “It was not a bad experience but I would have preferred to live in a conventional dorm.”
For this year’s freshmen, the Radisson showed up as a choice during the housing application process for the 2011-2012 school year, but it was later removed as an actual housing option.
“I was only considering Parkside Arts & Humanities, International Residential College and Birnkrant because I knew they were nice,” said Ashley Miyasaki, an undeclared freshman. “I heard that the accommodations were nice at the Radisson, but people were lonely there.”
Now that it is no longer housing students, the Radisson aims to focus its efforts solely on serving hotel guests.
“It was tough on staff to try and manage a hotel and student residence in the same building,” Jackson said. “The managers of the Radisson can get back to ensuring that it is a first-rate hotel that serves its guests very well.”
Jackson said the hotel’s business has picked up since the decision was made not to house students there.
Where will all the easy girls go?

Senior setter Kendall Bateman has been awarded with two Pac-10 conference honorable mentions, a Pac-10 All-Academic honorable mention and an All-American honor during her career at USC.
Example · As well as with being one of the top volleyball players at USC, senior setter Kendall Bateman is a role model in the community. - Daily Trojan file photo
This year Bateman was one of 30 candidates to be nominated for the 2011 Lowe’s Senior CLASS Award. An acronym for Celebrating Loyalty and Achievement for Staying in School, the award focuses on four areas — community, classroom, character and competition.
The candidates include nine AVCA All-Americans and eight honorable mention All-Americans from last season.
Midway through the regular season, the 30 candidates will be placed on a ballot and narrowed to 10 finalists.
Lowe’s, an official corporate sponsor of the NCAA, will announce the award winner during the 2011 NCAA Women’s Volleyball Championship in San Antonio in mid-December.
Last year Bateman was named to the AVCA All-America second team, recording 1,567 assists, which was the second-highest single-season total in USC history. She also led the Pac-10 in assists per set.
Along with senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter and senior middle blocker Lauren Williams, Bateman played an instrumental role in leading the Women of Troy to a Final Four appearance against California.
With 3,115 career assists, Bateman has the opportunity to set the USC career record. She currently trails all-time leader Janice Mounts.

For the first time in the history of the program, the USC women’s soccer team was swept off McAlister Field last week. A 2-1 loss to Long Beach State on opening day was followed with a 3-1 defeat at the hands of San Diego.
Leadership · After its first losing weekend at McAlister Field in program history, senior midfielder Ashli Sandoval will look to get the Women of Troy back on track against Kansas and Pacific this weekend. - Mac Carlile | Daily Trojan
As a result, USC coach Ali Khosroshahin has drastically simplified the team’s approach, as the Women of Troy (0-2) prepare to face Kansas (1-1) and Pacific (1-1) in this weekend’s San Diego tournament at Torero Stadium.
“The simple ball is the best ball and the most effective ball,” sophomore midfielder Haley Boysen said. “That’s been the theme of the week.”
Last weekend the Women of Troy considerably outplayed Long Beach State on Friday before conceding a goal in the 86th that broke the deadlock at 1-1. On Sunday, however, they were completely outplayed by San Diego, who coasted to a comfortable 3-1 victory over the Women of Troy.
“That’s the nature of our game,” Khosroshahin said. “You can dominate a game and lose. We made a few critical mistakes and we got punished for them.”
The most visible mistakes — those which led to opposing goals — were made on the defensive backline. The group is inexperienced to say the least, featuring just one returning starter in senior defender Claire Schloemer. The rest of the defense consists of junior Kristina Noriega, who is in her first season with the squad after transferring from UC Riverside. And senior Ashli Sandoval and sophomore Autumn Altamirano are making the transition from midfield to defense.
“It’s a pretty big swing,” Altamirano said. “You have to switch from offense to defense so quick in games. It’s hard.”
As a group, the backline is focusing on working together to avoid those most visible and costly errors.
“We need better awareness defensively,” Khosroshahin said. “I thought we got caught in transition too much. We need better awareness and structure.”
Khosroshahin also talked about less visible mistakes — those which occur up front and negate potential Trojan goal-scoring opportunities.
“We’ve been working a lot on being patient up there,” Khosroshahin said. “Last weekend we tried to act too quickly. If there was no avenue we forced one. We need to hold on to the ball and wait for help to come, and then find a different approach to the goal.”
The focus on patience and simplicity is exemplary of the “Spanish” style of play Khosroshahin is trying to instill.
Notice the new “Trojan Fútbol” patch looks nearly identical to that of the legendary Spanish club FC Barcelona — infamous or rather famous for possessing and passing their opponents to death.
“It’s all about possession,” Khosroshahin said. “That’s what the game is all about. That’s what we’re focusing on.”
Boysen says, with this approach, the team can focus more on itself.
“We can control what we do a lot more than we can control what they do,” Boysen said. “It’s good to focus on us and not have to worry about them.”
As a result, Khosroshahin hasn’t given the Women of Troy any information about either Kansas or Pacific.
“It’s been all about us [this week],” Altamirano said. “We haven’t heard anything about the other teams. We usually get little things like their style and their formation. But we’ve gotten nothing. Nothing about either team.”
The Women of Troy will find out about those other teams — and themselves — when they take on the Jayhawks this Friday at 5 p.m. and Pacific on Sunday at 2 p.m. in San Diego.
can’t recruit….how can you wow recruits with that parking lot they play on.
The Coach can’t recruit basically. He won the title with Millender’s players and now the team has gone downhill
steadily the last couple of years. No excuse for losing to the likes of CSULB and San Diego at home.

USC has begun finalizing its depth chart, announcing freshman quarterback Cody Kessler, not fellow freshman signal caller Max Wittek, will begin the year serving as the backup to junior quarterback Matt Barkley.
Compete· Freshman quarterback Cody Kessler was named the second-string quarterback, beating out three others vying for the job. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
“Both guys played great and either could be the quarterback whenever Matt leaves,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said.
Redshirt freshman quarterback Jesse Scroggins was the leading candidate for the position following spring practice, but he tore ligaments in his throwing thumb during the team’s second scrimmage.
With Scroggins expected to make a full return to the Trojans soon, Kessler’s stranglehold on the No. 2 quarterback position might not last.
“[Scroggins] will be in the mix,” Kiffin said. “When that time comes, we will go back to that.”
Kessler, however, remains optimistic about his new role, citing maturity and focus as the reasons for his strong play this fall.
“You can’t go in and play like a freshman,” Kessler said. “Show confidence, be levelheaded on the field and don’t try to force anything that would make the play worse.”
But with Wittek, a highly regarded quarterback in his own right still on the roster, Kessler’s battle to nab the starting job was made even more difficult.
“Coach Kiffin prepares every guy the same way,” Kessler said. “You have to come out and compete. You can’t have a bad day.”

Though Kessler showed poise beyond his years under center, similarly, redshirt freshman tailback, D.J. Morgan has become more consistent and is improving in his own right, according to the coaching staff.
Though the tailback position is currently unsettled, Morgan said that senior tailback Marc Tyler has been a mentor to him as he adjusts to the play calling.
“If I have a question, mess up or think I messed up, I just ask Marc and make corrections if they need to be done” Morgan said. “I want to become an every down back.”
Because of the absence of Tyler, Morgan has taken advantage of getting more snaps.
“With less backs, I’m getting more reps,” he said. “I can learn while I am doing it rather than watching someone else.”
Tyler, who rejoined the team for practice Wednesday, has been complimented by coaches and teammates for his performance.
“[Tyler] looks good,” Kiffin said. “Obviously it’s a transition from working out to putting pads on with players around him. We’ve really tried to beat him up on service team and push him to make it a game like down there. It’s just part of the progression.”

With junior guard Abe Markowitz still sidelined because of a left foot injury, freshman Marcus Martin and Martin Coleman have been battling for the spot adjacent to center Khaled Holmes.
“I worked hard and they motivated me all through camp,” Martin said. “The reps came from working hard. Some days I might get reps and other days I might not get reps.”
Kiffin has been pleased with the freshman lineman’s play as well.
“He’s really had a great week,” he said. “We got to force in there to see if he will redshirt or play for us.”
 
—
 
Because of inexperience at the position stemming from the graduation of Stanley Havili, senior tight end Rhett Ellison has moved full time to fullback.
“There are different techniques for me with blocking, compared to tight end,” Ellison said. “As a fullback, you get to see more.”
It has not been confirmed whether Ellison will be playing both fullback and tight end this season.
 
—
 
Cornerback Taylor Ashton, cornerback Brian Baucham, middle linebacker Chris Galippo and wide receiver De’Von Flournoy are out with injuries, Kiffin announced Thursday. Freshman defensive tackle Antwaun Woods was cleared by the NCAA clearing house. The Trojans are still waiting on Greg Townsend to also be cleared.
Despite critical injuries, Kiffin remains calm about the upcoming season.
“I think they’ve improved,” Kiffin said when asked about his defense in particular. “I feel like they’re tackling and lining up better.”

It happened in a flash — almost unexpectedly.
Sophomore outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana, who appeared to be the future of an already bright USC women’s volleyball program after being named Pac-10 Freshman of the Year in 2010, was gone. There was neither a news conference nor an in-depth explanation given.
A simple, almost mundane, 95-word press release was issued, alerting the masses to the fact that the talented sophomore would be “ineligible” for the upcoming season and leaving more questions than answers.
“We exhausted all of our resources in order to help Falyn retain her eligibility,” Haley said. “We have very high expectations of our student-athletes, on and off the court, here at USC.”
Was this because of academics? Or did it confirm message board rumors that Fonoimoana was looking to transfer to Hawaii?
Regardless of the reason behind her departure, it leaves a gaping hole on the Women of Troy’s roster. After all, she finished second in the team last season in points and kills with 398.
But USC will survive.
Granted, you don’t replace those kind of stats overnight, but with nine talented starters returning after a run to the semifinals of the NCAA tournament in 2010, the Women of Troy, nonetheless, could very well notch back-to-back Final Four appearances. Heck, with a No. 2 preseason ranking, a national title is in play as well.
With the Fonoimoana ordeal in the past, the team and the coaching staff can now move forward, putting its rocky week behind them.
USC coach Mick Haley shouldn’t be one to worry, either. I’d be hesitant to get worked up over one player, especially when he has a multitude of talented student-athletes able and ready to make up for her absence.
Haley certainly has the pedigree to back that up.
Since coming to USC, Haley has guided the Women of Troy to two national championships, five Final Four appearances and 10 consecutive NCAA tournament appearances in 11 years; it’s quite the résumé.
Possibly atop his laundry list of accomplishments, he guided the Women of Troy to an undefeated 2003 season, a rare feat in collegiate athletics.
This year the Women of Troy have a ranking to defend, but more importantly, the top spot to chase.
No. 1 Penn State, winners of four straight national championships, currently sit atop the collegiate volleyball world, but a fifth straight title won’t be easy looking at USC’s roster.
The Women of Troy boast an impressive trio in outside hitter Alex Jupiter, setter Kendall Bateman and middle blocker Lauren Williams. All three are seniors and all three were All-Americans last season. And all three are among the best in school history.
This season Jupiter has the opportunity to break the record for kills, service aces and points for a career at USC. Bateman can also set the career record for assists. And Williams, who at 6-foot-4 remains an incredibly important asset for the Women of Troy, particularly in terms of blocking, after posting 115 blocks last season.
All three will be counted upon to make up for the absence of Fonoimoana, as well as the loss of sophomore middle blocker Alexis Olgard for the first couple weeks of the season because of offseason knee surgery.
To aid the experience of their three seniors, last year’s No. 1 recruiting class, including sophomore libero Natalie Hagglund, sophomore outside hitter Kirby Bunham and sophomore outside hitter Sara Shaw will take on an even greater role.
And an incoming freshman class rated 10th in the nation will also get an opportunity to play early in the season.
So despite all the hoopla surrounding Fonoimoana, this USC squad still has the talent, experience, depth and coaching pedigree to challenge and upend the Nittany Lions four-year reign at the top.
With Haley directing Jupiter, Bateman, Williams and a group of talented underclassman, no Fonoimoana doesn’t mean no NCAA championship.
Without its Pac-10 Freshman Player of the Year, there is really no need to worry at all; she’s just another player on this deep and talented roster that can easily be replaced, just another road bump to get over on the way to another NCAA appearance and further.

The article doesn’t clarify if Falyn left school or is just ineligible and still enrolled at USC. The ranking of #2 nationally was made  with her being on the team. Personally do not believe everything was done to keep her eligible. Some
personality conflict exist with the coaching staff and her attitude.

The No. 2 USC women’s volleyball team’s 2010 title aspirations ended in straight sets in a national semifinal matchup against No.7-seeded California in mid-December in Kansas City.

But after receiving five first-place votes in the annual preseason top-25 poll, the Women of Troy remain optimistic that they can reverse those fortunes in 2011.
“We know we have a lot of work to do,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “But once you get to the Final Four, you get hungry and you want to go back. Once the kids realize how much fun it is, they work their tails off to get back.”
Despite a fair share of optimism heading into a season, which begins Friday against No. 12 Minnesota in the first game of the Rockvale Outlets/AVCA Showcase in University Park, Penn., Haley has downplayed the team’s lofty preseason rankings and hype that surrounds the program. The Women of Troy were the consensus pick to win the Pac-12 title.
“In the early season rankings, they always put teams that are going to play each other higher so it hypes the game [for] attendance,” Haley said. “But I think once we get comfortable, we should be a lot better than we were last year.”
The reasons for high expectations are evident.
USC returns three senior All-Americans in outside hitter Alex Jupiter, setter Kendall Bateman and middle blocker Lauren Williams, all of whom rank among some of the program’s best in recent memory.
In 2010, Jupiter finished with 532 kills, which led the team, and after 1,567 assists last season, Bateman could break the school’s career mark for assists by the year’s end.
But the loss of sophomore outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana, who earned Pac-10 Freshman of the Year honors last season, could be particularly costly after the Hermosa Beach, Calif., native was declared ineligible for the season last week.
“We exhausted all of our resources in order to help Falyn retain her eligibility,” Haley said in a statement. “We have very high expectations of our student-athletes, on and off the court, here at USC.”
No further explanation was issued.
Others, such as sophomore middle blocker Alexis Olgard, will also miss the first few weeks of the season after undergoing knee surgery in the spring.
For the Women of Troy, however, the team has plenty of depth to recover for the recent losses.
Sophomore Kirby Burnham, who fought with Fonoimoana for a starting job last season, will be slotted back into the starting lineup.
“I remember last year when Kirby and Falyn were competing for the same spot, and [Kirby] has made some great improvements [since then],” Jupiter said. “She’s just so aggressive and physical … just another great outside hitter.”
Freshman middle blocker Hannah Schraer, part of Haley’s top-10 recruiting class this year, is expected to start until Olgard returns.
The squad will have to hope its makeshift lineup meshes quickly, as its early schedule is brutal.
Its first two matches are against the No. 12 Golden Gophers and No. 1 Penn State on Saturday in a true road game.
The Nittany Lions are four-time defending champions.
“We haven’t played Penn State since my class has been here, so we’re really excited to get to challenge ourselves and play at that level,” Jupiter said. “It’s what we need to get in our groove for the season.”
The Women of Troy don’t just have a tough opening weekend; their first seven games are on the road, and six of their first 12 opponents are in the top 12 of the Division I rankings.
They won’t play at home at the Galen Center until their conference opener versus UCLA on Sept. 9.
But the coaching staff and players alike welcome the stiff competition.
“It is a very hard start, but as long as we keep up with our defense and our passing, and keep trying as a team, we’ll be able to compete with anyone,” Jupiter said.
 
Poor recruiting by USC. Players attitude and mom should have been red flag. Tunnel vision! Makes you miss great players w good work ethics and passion to play.

In the past, singer-songwriters were known for the diversified sounds, engaging words and raw creativity they used to shape their music. Just look at Bob Dylan’s off-key vocals mixed with his metaphorical, protesting lyrics, Johnny Cash’s low, soothing ballads and effortless guitar skill and Janis Joplin’s raspy love songs.
Today’s singer-songwriters instead tend to opt for tender falsetto vocals mixed with simple, airy acoustic chords and lyrics composed around basic themes like love and heartache.
Twenty-seven-year-old Iowa-born Jason Reeves is no exception to this repetitive cycle. With the support of his family, Reeves dropped out of college and has since produced multiple albums — his first when he was 19.
The first album that gained him recognition was The Magnificent Adventures of Heartache (And Other Frightening Tales…) in 2007. Many of the songs were said to have extremely heartfelt lyrics intertwined with a sound similar to James Taylor and John Mayer. Reeves garnered attention in the folk music community and debuted at No. 2 on iTunes’ folk chart.
Unfortunately, fans of Reeves will be let down by his latest release, The Lovesick, since it does not bring any creative or real originality into the music industry. Instead, it highlights an artist with an auto-tuned falsetto, catchy beats and basic lyrics that discuss a basic love tale: a shy boy who can’t convey how in love he is with a girl, who finally gets the courage and says what they have is infinity to one, and eventually he is heartbroken. Even the album cover, which portrays a black-and-white picture of Reeves’ face and a childish hand drawn heart in one of his pupils, indicates the cliché depiction of love.
The album kicks off with his single “Helium Hearts,” which could be the perfect Disney television show theme song because of what sounds like a combination of Howie Day’s simple guitar strums and the Backstreet Boys’ young vocals. Following is “Simple Song,” which could not have been more precisely named because it only adds to Reeves’ boy band sound, simplistic lyrics, electronic beats and male background vocals, instead of him being a serious and poetic singer-songwriter.
The Lovesick continues with the second-most downloaded song off the album, “Save My Heart,” which sounds like a lesser LFO hit with awkward synthesizer beats and prepubescent lyrics about a guy not being able to tell the one he loves his feelings.
Reeves brings another happy, upbeat and bland love song to the collection with “Infinity to One,” where he wails about what he and the girl he loves have, and how hard that love is to find. “Sticks and Stones” is an attempt to bring a pop boy into the club with a driving beat and heavy synthesizer.
The most popular song off the album is “No Lies,” which features Colbie Caillat, a good friend of Reeves, but sounds like a poor karaoke duet instead of what could’ve been beautiful harmonies intertwined with deep lyrics to create an unbelievably touching love song.
“Only With You” follows, and sounds more like Reeves’ earlier music because it is stripped of club beats, synthesizer and extraneous background vocals.
Reeves follows with another attempt at a duet with Kara DioGuardi in “No One Ever Taught Us,” but the song is disappointing — from a musical standpoint  — as he is only outshined by her graceful voice.
“Alone” and “Truth” are the final two tracks on The Lovesick, and are Reeves’ hope to create slower, touching love songs. “Alone” bleats insignificant and dull words, such as If we are better off apart then I hope wherever we go we’re always brave enough to be alone, while “Truth” evokes the sound of a lesser Daniel Bedingfield.
The Lovesick contains a lack of vision, nuance and any of the musical or vocal talent that Reeves could exhibit. Instead, The Lovesick brings listeners back to the late ’90s and early 2000s when the likes of Ashley Parker Angel and the Backstreet Boys were blasting through tween stereos.
The simplicity of the album demonstrates Jason Reeves to be a less attractive, male version of Taylor Swift. Hopefully, he can revive his name in the coming year with an artistic, soulful and emotional album that displays more prowess.
 
 
Hi Logan,
I arrived at your review on an unrelated search, and being a fan of Colbie Caillat, was aware of Jason Reeves so I read through this review.  After reading it, all I can say is…wow, brutal review!  I’ve never heard a Jason Reeves CD prior to this, only his work with Colbie Caillat but this review intrigued me enough to see if it was really as bad as you say it is.
I loaded up Spotify and listened to the entire album for free and can safely say that you’re way off base with your review.  I can’t compare and contrast between this album and his previous releases as I haven’t listened to them, but in comparison to the work Jason has done with Colbie Caillat, this is exactly the same style of music.  Colbie’s music has become more refined as she’s put out new albums and this album is very similar in style to her most recent release.  I also disagree that it’s anything close to Backstreet Boys – Every song has prominent acoustic guitar, piano, and clear drums.
You’re analysis of “Sticks And Stones” being an attempt for him to create a club song is also not accurate – it’s more of Michael Jackson-ish sounding song and it’s a groovin’ track.  The song with Colbie Caillat is minimalist, as far as instrumentation, and a beautiful song reflective of the older material her and Jason did together on her first album with the roles reversed – Jason takes the lead and Colbie backs him up.
I’d venture to say that you “lump” a lot of music in this genre into the “That’s Backstreet Boys” pile based on your generalized statement “Today’s singer-songwriters instead tend to opt for tender falsetto vocals mixed with simple, airy acoustic chords and lyrics composed around basic themes like love and heartache,” before saying “Jason Reeves is no exception to this repetitive cycle.”
Bottom line for anyone reading this…if you liked Colbie Caillat’s last release and are a fan of the work her and Jason have done in the past, this CD is certainly worth picking up.

Rise of the Planet of the Apes came out two weeks ago, followed by Conan the Barbarian and Fright Night last week. Soon they will be joined by The Three Musketeers and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Even Death Note and Akira are emerging from development hell. Besides a fetching male lead, these films have another common denominator: They are all remakes.
Daunting tasks · Films such as Fright Night exemplify the continuing trend of remaking cult classics into newer renditions with contemporary special effects, changed themes and star-studded casts. - Photo courtesy of Walt Disney Studios Global Publicity
It’s weird to see a film in Hollywood these days that is not a sequel, prequel, book adaptation, Judd Apatow comedy or a remake. This causes some people to proclaim Hollywood a cesspit of unoriginal ideas and the death knell to cinematic creativity.
Are remakes proof that Hollywood has lost all imagination or are they an example of the phrase “imitation is the highest form of flattery?”
Despite accusations of Hollywood’s current lack of creativity, remakes are not a new phenomenon. Plenty of movies from the ’40s and ’50s were remakes of earlier films. Even the hallowed Alfred Hitchcock remade one of his own 1934 films, The Man Who Knew Too Much, into the 1956 James Stewart classic beloved by film buffs.
Yet everyone has seen a god-awful remake. 1998’s Psycho had Hitchcock rolling in his grave. M. Night Shyamalan’s The Last Airbender caused fanboy riots and the 2005 remake of John Carpenter’s The Fog was a figurative slap in the face to the creepy original. Remakes have caused black marks on many résumés. But one should not forget the array of good remakes.
Ocean’s 11, the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Scarface and Insomnia are all remakes, but few people even remember the originals. Remakes can be a way to take a story in a new, interesting direction, or to ensure a good story is not forgotten.
Remakes can also be an interesting way to explore a theme. One of Hollywood’s most lauded comedies, 1980’s Airplane!, is actually a remake of 1957’s Zero Hour! starring Dana Mitchell. The difference is that Airplane! is a spoof, while Zero Hour! is a tense thriller.
In Zack Snyder’s remake of Dawn of the Dead, Snyder further develops a theme George Romero only briefly touched on — the nature of media during a crisis. Romero’s original cult favorite touched on this idea but spent more time parodying society. Today, with perceptions so dictated by media, Snyder’s emphasis is an interesting twist, even though the biker gang of the original film was sorely missed.
As with The Man Who Knew Too Much, remakes can also be a way for creators to perfect their visions. Hitchcock believed his original was too amateurish. Meanwhile, Joss Whedon, who wrote the screenplay for the fun but cheesy Buffy the Vampire Slayer film, did not think the film properly channeled his genre-hopping story. In 1997 he had the chance to remake the film into a full TV series and created a cult classic.
Meanwhile, though one might wish Americans were more embracing of foreign cinema, sometimes a remake is the chief way America sees a great story. Western epics including 1960’s The Magnificent Seven and 1964’s Fistful of Dollars are remakes of two Akira Kurosawa films, Seven Samurai and Yojimbo. The three directors are all famous in their own right and the argument of which is better is somewhat moot.
Interestingly, placing these Japanese epics in a Western allows Americans to put the stories in a cultural context. Japan even returned the favor when it made Tokyo Godfathers, a kooky anime remade from the 1948 John Wayne western 3 Godfathers, where three hobos replace three outlaws.
Hollywood rarely creates films that are in no way asked for. America is a sentimental country. We treasure our cultural heritage — the guy on St. Patrick’s Day downs Guinness as a tribute to his Irish heritage. We too treasure our pop culture, as seen with remakes like Friday the 13th — even bloodcurdling sentiment is still sentiment.
With remakes, perhaps we should look to Machiavelli, who said, “One must consider the final result.”
Critical acclaim, box office numbers and DVD sales usually indicate a movie’s success or failure. If you create a great remake, you’re a visionary paying tribute. If it flops, you’re an unimaginative washout.

We call it the “dog days of summer,” or “boknal” in Korean.
Cool eats · Experimenting with cold, Korean dishes, like pat bing soo, is a great way to combat the dry heat and experience cultural treasures. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
It’s the hottest period of the summer, when the heat is so unbearable you just want to hibernate in an air-conditioned room crunching ice cubes.
Thankfully, in Los Angeles such unbearably hot and humid days are rare, but the sun can get pretty exhausting on certain August and September afternoons. For those high-temperature days, take a trip to Koreatown and cool down the Korean way — with popular summer dishes that will not just revive your strength but your appetite too.
Naeng myun (cold noodles)
In the dead of summer, every naeng myun house in Korea becomes lively with customers craving the thirst-quenching bowl of chewy skinny noodles. In Koreatown, these noodle houses are lesser known but still frequented by people who have discovered this wonderful and delicious satisfaction.
Naeng myun — literally, “chilled noodles” — is typically served in a cold stainless bowl with julienned cucumbers, a hard-boiled egg and sprinkles of sesame seeds. The noodles range widely from buckwheat noodles to kudzu noodles and even green tea noodles, but the two main varieties of this popular summer dish include mul naeng myun — “water cold noodles” — and bibim naeng myun — “mixed cold noodles.”
The “water” version is served with ice-cold broth (usually beef), while the “mixed” version comes dry with a spicy dressing and broth on the side. Both are served as cold as possible.
There are numerous restaurants in Koreatown selling these tasty noodles, but stick to the ones that specialize only in naeng myun, as the texture of their noodles and the intensity of their broth will be far superior.
Kong guk soo (soybean noodles)
There must be something refreshing and enticing about slurping noodles on a hot summer day. Kong guk soo — or noodles in chilled soybean soup — is another Korean dish, devour-worthy on a hot summer day.
For such a simple noodle soup, kong guk soo requires a bit of labor to make. Whole soybeans are soaked, skinned and boiled, then puréed into a thin milky broth, sometimes with pine nuts, sesame seeds and/or walnuts. But after this initial preparation, assembly is quick and easy.
The nutty, naturally-sweet-yet-savory milk is poured over velvety wheat noodles and served chilled with julienned cucumbers, tomato and sesame seeds. The soup is pure white and creamy and looks sinfully rich, but the taste is incredibly light and refreshing. It is also one of the few naturally vegetarian/vegan dishes in Korean cuisine — not to mention this dish earns bonus points for its high protein and low fat nutritional profile.
Myung Dong Kyo Ja on Wilshire Boulevard, though specializing in dumpling by name, is well known among the Koreatown community for its kong guk soo, and Ma Dang Gook Soo on Western Avenue is another popular place.
Sam Gye Tang (ginseng chicken soup)
A steaming dish in the middle of a blistering day? According to the Korean belief, sam gye tang fights electrolyte depletion and restores health and stamina by heating up the inner body while also cooling the outer.
A young, whole chicken is stuffed with nutritious ingredients like glutinous rice, chestnuts, ginseng, jujubes (a type of date), garlic and ginger, then boiled in its own broth until the soup turns milky white. With a side of cold, spicy kimchi, there is no hot summer dish more comforting and satisfying.
Los Angeles is not yet home to a place specializing in sam gye tang, but Bulrocho on Vermont Avenue and Mountain Café on Eighth Street serve decent renditions of the dish in hot clay pots. A note: The dish might seem rather bland at first, but you are expected to season it yourself with salt and pepper.
Pat Bing Soo (shaved ice)
Translated literally, pat bing soo means “red bean ice water.” Toppings vary from shop to shop, but the basic, necessary ingredients consist of shaved ice, sweetened adzuki beans, sweetened condensed milk and rice cake bits. Other fun toppings include ice cream, colorful cereal, fresh fruits and roasted soybean powder.
It’s a messy, sticky dish that’s meant to be shared among friends — the ingredients are mixed together, and the best part is the sweet, milky slurry of melted ice that you slurp up toward the bottom of the bowl.
Every single Korean coffee shop and cafe sells this summer dessert — it’s a mandatory staple.

For a decade, Vera Farmiga has blessed audiences with one impeccably conveyed supporting character after another — the police psychiatrist caught between two sides in The Departed, the non-committal sexpot who quietly rejuvenates George Clooney’s appetite for an honest human connection in Up in the Air and even the distraught mother who fails to accept that her adopted 9 year-old is a murderous maniac in Orphan.
Design by Kate Mock | Daily Trojan
Given Farmiga’s affinity for varied, challenging material, it is hardly a surprise that for her directorial debut, she selected Higher Ground, a film that presented the arduous task of balancing the enormity of a decades-spanning narrative with the intimacy of one woman’s intrinsic journey.
Written by Carolyn S. Briggs and Tim Metcalfe, based on Briggs’ memoir, the film follows protagonist Corinne Walker’s lifelong struggle to find meaning in her Midwestern existence through faith.
Farmiga’s directorial skill is evident from the get-go, as she nimbly guides the viewer through Corinne’s childhood and adolescence, from her first religious experience at Bible school to her out-of-wedlock teenage pregnancy. Rarely do rapid-fire snapshots of youth, designed as a movie’s preamble, feel so authentic — a testament to Farmiga’s construction.
At the crux of the film is a tragic bus accident that nearly kills adult Corrine (Farmiga) and now-husband Ethan’s (Joshua Leonard) newborn. The two resolve that God has saved them, and they vow to commit to a religious lifestyle, joining Pastor Bill’s (Norbert Leo Butz) Evangelical congregation, a friendly but dogmatic group.
What follows is less about plot than it is about Corinne’s internal conflict, as she comes to progressively doubt the church’s role as the rock in her life through the struggles of three more children and marital strife with Ethan. This doubt is deeply entrenched in the gender politics of her religion, where men are held as dominant and Corinne’s legitimate, scripture-based questions are seen as efforts to undermine that dominance.
The “adult” portion of Higher Ground — the bulk of the film — works because Farmiga the director knows what Farmiga the actress needs: a lack of interference. This is the quietest, most nuanced performance designed to carry a movie in recent memory and, as a result, any directorial flourish would have distracted from the meat. Even an unusually long take could have diverted attention away from Farmiga’s performance, robbing it of its accumulating power. Stripped down to the bare essentials, Higher Ground is a commanding showcase of Farmiga’s raw talent.
Farmiga’s minimalist filmmaking approach likewise allows her co-stars to shine. The under-appreciated, character actor Joshua Leonard does an excellent job of becoming Corrine’s foil in the form of her husband — he is a resigned follower where she is an active doubter — without becoming the villain. Nina Arianda (Midnight in Paris) is also especially noteworthy as Corinne’s sister, who seeks in drugs what Corinne seeks in religion. And playing Corrine as a teenager, Taissa Farmiga (Vera’s younger sister) proves that acting chops run in the family.
Aside from making the performances the center of the show, the most integral directorial choice Farmiga made was to not judge Evangelicalism in general, instead making criticisms from Corinne’s specific perspective. Ever since George W. Bush brought Christianity squarely back into the national spotlight, Hollywood has had a field day satirizing it, although usually tepidly.
But Farmiga and company keep the potshots to a minimum — only a humorous scene in which the men learn how to pleasure their wives by listening to a Church-issued instructional tape feels like an ornery caricature — and the religious commentary in turn benefits from being wholly character-driven.
The determining factor as to whether viewers will find Higher Ground great or simply good will depend on how much they relate to the material. Those who have personally toiled with their faith may find real transcendence in Corrine’s story, but even the most resolute atheists will, at the very least, appreciate the movie because it’s as well acted and well told as nearly any other film this year.

The 2012 presidential candidates are slowly becoming solidified, and it’s no surprise that President Barack Obama has decided to run again in hopes of serving a second term. Republican candidates like Michele Bachmann make Obama’s re-election even more plausible; remember when Bachmann said abolishing the minimum wage would be a good idea?
All political ideologies aside, it makes sense Obama should be re-elected as president.
Four years is hardly enough time to clean up the mess predecessors left for Obama when he took office. America’s unemployment rate is still rocky and, as the deficit continues to grow, we need a stable force.
If the American people were to elect a new president, the shift at this time of fragility could potentially send the United States into a period of even further economic instability, coupled with increasing partisanship.
Obama has proven to be a stable force who can still procure change despite bipartisanship in Congress. Many were disappointed with some of his decisions — his promise to bring back the troops deployed in Iraq was fulfilled only partially, after his promise to do the job completely helped get him into office — but at this point in time it’s important to realize that Obama has made more positive decisions than negative ones.
Consider, for example, the progress he has made in social politics. In 2009, Obama signed into law the Lilly Ledbetter bill, which gives women more power in suing their employers for unequal pay. This was Obama’s first piece of legislation, and it immediately set this administration apart from that of George W. Bush, which had blocked the bill. He also appointed two females to the United States Supreme Court — another milestone.
Politically speaking, Obama has limited lobbyist access, giving lobbyists less time to try and sway the president — a nice change from the days when Scooter Libby and his friends were running around the White House.  It also allows for at least partial independent thinking on behalf of members in Congress. He ordered a review of all federal options to cut wasteful spending in an effort to balance our out-of-whack budget.
Economically speaking, Obama has halted a major depression. In July, unemployment was at 9.1 percent — an improvement from 10.1 percent in October 2009.
The problem is that people are expecting Obama to solve things overnight.
But when one takes time to really weed through everything he has done, it’s clear that progress is being made — just at a slower pace; the road to recovery is not an easy one.
Though all presidents have done both good and bad things, something sets Obama apart: his charisma, for one, but most of all, his commitment to following through with his promises — and that’s something I didn’t even know politicians were capable of.
Equally important, Obama is a fresh face, he is relatable and he is — dare I say it — hilarious.
Recall the debacle with Donald Trump, former potential GOP candidate, concerning his birth place. Obama’s personality and politics create an alluring pair for voters.
Many who voted for the first time in 2008 voted because they believed Obama could solve things. And he can, but we desperately need to give him more time to finish what he started.
There are some promising GOP candidates, such as Mitt Romney, who could bring great ideas to the table.
But this country needs stability, not political upheaval.
Obama is the answer to the country’s problems for now.
 
Mellissa Linton is a sophomore majoring in English literature. Her counterpoint runs every Friday.
Good Article OBAMA needs to be RE-ELECTED to finish the good changes he started  “A lot is out of his hands,”  . “There is only so much one person can do, and one person cannot be blamed for the acts of others.” Politically unaligned, she voted for Obama in 2008 and says she’ll probably do so againitcle.. OBAMA needs to be re-elected to finish the good changes . The white house was already a mess when he took office. thank you miss Linton for sucha a great article..
“There is only so much one person can do”. 
Obama and the Democratic Party had control of the White House and both houses of Congress with solid majorities from 2009 to the beginning of this year, and yet all of their actions during this two-year period controlling the government failed to improve the economy, even to the levels that they promised it would. For example – they said that when their stimulus bill was passed, unemployment would not rise above 8% nationally. The bill passed, and yet unemployment continued to rise to a high of 10.5% and has not once fallen below 9% in the two and a half years since.
How do you explain that?
Demosthenes….
Demand is UNLIMITED.. Anyone can demand anything at anytime.. The trick is to produce it and supply it and we dont do that.. The chinese arent lending us as much anymore so we cant buy their goods they produce..
The President and fed reserve are causing MASSIVE inflation.. They are increasing the money supply daily, you will see it in prices soon when all the deleveraging ends and foreign banks stop propping up the dollar..
The problem in our economy is the debt and Massive bad allocation of capital because of all the bailouts and the stimulus and plus the internal regulations that have made it impossible to conduct business in America. and high taxes..
I would need two hours and a series of flow charts to properly explain how absurd the thesis of this article is.
WOW… you obviously have never been in the real world if you think this president has been effective.  The only thing he has been effective at doing is polarizing our country and spending away our future. He is Jimmy Carter part duex.  Can you say INFLATION?
You really think “INFLATION” is the utmost concern, right now? lol. No, actually right now, it appears lack of demand and unemployment are. Econ 101–the phillips curve: inflation and unemployment are inversely related. In fact, targeting a higher inflation rate, about 3-4%, right now is good-it encourages borrowing and discourages people from hoarding cash (i.e., this stimulates consumer spending and demand which subsequently sends a signal for businesses to employ.) 
“Wow… you obviously have never been in the real world if you think this president is causing massive INFLATION.”
Anyone who thinks inflation is a good thing is an idiot.  Inflation destroys your purchasing power and punishes people who save their money, making it not worth what is was before.
“Wow… you obviously have never been in the real world if you think this president is causing massive INFLATION.”
You got me there… Let me know if you need a job and I will see if inflation is high enough to take on new employees because that savings account is worthless.

For as questionable as Michele Bachmann’s track record and campaign has been, one popular Bachmann-led chant should be taken very seriously: “one-term president.” 
With this terminology, Bachmann is attempting to make her campaign look stronger by outlining the basic weaknesses of President Barack Obama’s first term. And these weaknesses are not exaggerated.
Obama made the suggestion that the same voters who brought him to the Oval Office in 2008 might turn right around and vote him out, in an interview with Matt Lauer on Feb. 1, 2009, just days after his presidency officially started. The president said the American people would begin to see some economic progress within the first year of his presidency.
A failure to turn our economic downfall around, he said, within his first three years in office could result in a “one-term proposition.”
Obama’s statement rings true today. Though he likely meant it as a show of confidence that he would improve our economic state of affairs, the idea that things almost seem to have gotten worse only proves that Obama should be voted out of office, because he has failed to live up to the promises that matter most to the American people.
Besides a couple of financially hopeful recovery periods, the economy has continued to deteriorate to the point that multiple rumors of a double-dip recession have been floating around.
Though the 4.1 percent loss in GDP brought about by the initial recession was erased by economic growth in the final months of 2010, economists maintain the economy is still smaller than it was before the recession hit.
Government surveys show the American people are spending less and less, and for good reason: Housing prices have remained dismally low, and millions of Americans have to pay back mortgage debts that exceed the price values of their homes.
Even worse is the unemployment rate. Obama’s deputy communications director holds the president has added 2.3 million jobs to the economy.
The unemployment rate, however, has increased. When Obama took office in January 2009, the national unemployment rate was at 7.8 percent.
The latest employment report by the U.S. Department of Labor shows that it is now at 9.1 percent.
An unemployment rate this high is unacceptable.
President Obama does have the best interests of the American people at heart, but his actions in promoting these interests have not been successful.
Continuing to spend money we don’t have is incompatible with job creation and economic growth. It will only dig us into a deeper budgetary hole — one we might not be able to climb out of.
It took our credit rating getting downgraded to promote serious discussion about our nation’s debt and establish significant spending cuts, which need to occur on a larger scale so the market can rebound without the government spending its way to recovery.
Continuing to gamble with the livelihoods of struggling Americans is not an option.
Obama is obviously not the only one to blame for the current economic situation, but as leader of this country much of the responsibility lies chiefly on him.
The argument that he inherited the economic problem as a result of past policy failures is valid, and political polarization and extreme partisanship do prevent speedy and effective legislation.
The president has made an impressive effort at promoting bipartisanship in Washington, and he should be applauded for the positive gains he has made during his term. But as one of the foremost leaders of global politics and one of the most influential players in economic policy, he has failed in areas where success is absolutely vital.
We all might disagree on how we can pull our economy out of this slump and bring regular employment back to jobless Americans, but evidence shows we are in a worse position than we were when he took office. Obama should not be rewarded for subpar work with a second term.

You are completely insane if you really believe that American businesses are deliberately throwing away revenues by not hiring additional workers, as part of some bizarre conspiracy to oust Obama. Do you seriously think that millions of business owners all across America are willing to risk their own livelihoods just to get political revenge on someone? 
Sorry, but that is complete nonsense. When it comes to the market, profit trumps politics. The reason businesses are not hiring is simply because it is too risky to do so in the current economic climate.
You really need to factor in the economic realities about the so-called “recession”, which would be a full scale depression if Obama hadn’t taken so many needed steps. We were over the cliff, 3/4 of the way down. The stock market plunged, lost over 50% of its value. The banks lost trillions. There was no money to loan, so even people who wanted to buy a house, couldn’t. Neither could business. They were closing their doors left and right. All of that has turned around. The stock market doubled. Banks are stable and beginning to loan money again. Businesses aren’t shuttering their windows, in fact they’re sitting on $1-2 Trillion Dollars in profits. The only reason the unemployment rate hasn’t dropped is that those businesses would sooner sit on that money to keep the economy from growing in order to get Obama out, than start hiring and expanding again and maybe have to pay their fair share of the tax burden again. And the only deficit problem we have would be solved by making the rich give back the Bush tax cuts so social security benefits can be paid to boomers, which is where Clinton’s budget surplus came from in the first place.

Student Affairs and the Undergraduate Student Government jointly held Ronald Tutor Campus Center Day for the first time Thursday.
USG passed a resolution to make the first Thursday of every fall semester Ronald Tutor day, since the building had its grand opening on the first Thursday of the Fall 2010 semester.
Patrick Bailey, Senior Associate Dean of Student Affairs, said the purpose of the event was to increase awareness of the facilities of the campus center.
“Many students focus on the food court, that’s why it in the front and center, but each floor has an attraction, if you will, to guarantee traffic,” Bailey said.
Departments housed in the campus center held open houses, members of the football team held a campus conversation in the Forum, USC ambassadors gave art tours of the entire center and a raffle was held for football tickets, fanwear and airline tickets.
The day concluded with a comedy show in the Grand ballroom with Comedy Central comedians Kumail Najiani, Nick Vatterott and Duncan Trussell.
Bailey said he hopes to make Ronald Tutor Campus Center Day better attended so that it will be a “sweet end” to welcome week.
“This is the beginning of a custom that aims to build on Trojan traditions and introduce the familiar and unfamiliar alike to all that the Tutor Campus Center has to offer,” Bailey said.

The Chinese government recently unveiled its third list of 100 banned songs, with many famous U.S. pop artists making the list, including Lady Gaga. Six songs from the pop phenomenon’s latest album, “Born This Way,” made the list.
Censorship by the Chinese government has dominated news headlines in recent years, where anything considered politically dangerous or sensitive tends to disappear from the web. News of the uprisings in Egypt was mysteriously absent from the Internet in China, where past riots in Tibet, or anything related to the contested region, are glossed over. Controversial terms such as “Tiananmen” result in less-than-complete search results.
Although pop songs might not seem dangerous, the government’s banned songs list seems to be sending the message that they are, at least in Chinese culture. According to the Wall Street Journal, the English translation of the China Ministry of Culture’s announcement states the songs were “not in accordance with the Interim Provisions on Administration of Internet Culture and other regulations” and that they “disrupt the online music market order and endanger national cultural security.”
Other songs to make the list included Katy Perry’s “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.),” the Backstreet Boys’ “I Want it that Way,” songs by Owl City, Beyonce and Simple Plan, and other songs by artists from Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong and Malaysia.

The Pertusati Bookstore opened a FedEx Office on the third floor Monday, aiming to provide students with an easier option for shipping on campus.
New booking · The FedEx Office, now located on the third level of the Pertusati Bookstore, provides students with a place to ship, pack and print. Students can also submit requests online at FedEx.com. - Shabnam Ferdowsi | Daily Trojan
Dan Archer, director of the bookstore, said the store will make daily life more convenient for everyone on campus.
“It will only enhance the environment for the students, faculty and staff,” Archer said.
A FedEx Office was located in the basement of the bookstore until 2007 when FedEx made a corporate decision to leave the location.
Archer said he had noticed an increase in demand for a shipping and printing center on campus in the last few years.
“We did notice that students wanted some [printing and shipping venue] on campus,” Archer said. “For me, it was a priority to get it back.”
Since opening on Monday,  Claudia Padilla, FedEx office manager, said many students have used the printing center’s services.
Sina Hasheminassab, a graduate student studying environmental engineering, said he used the office for the first time Tuesday to make a copy and send a fax. He believes there is a definite need for the services provided by the FedEx Office.
“I will be here more and more,” Hasheminassab said. “It is very important. Everything that is here, I think is necessary.”
Archer said faculty and staff’s response to the new FedEx Office has been very positive.
“They are extremely happy to have a professional company like FedEx back on campus,” Archer said.
On football game days, the office will provide an opportunity for fans to ship souvenirs, rather than carry them to games, Padilla said.
The printing center will have the same hours as the bookstore — 7:45 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday.
Candice Navi, a sophomore majoring in communication, said the store is a great addition to the bookstore but wishes it remained open longer.
“It’s definitely very convenient,” Navi said. “Although, I wish the hours were extended and perhaps independent from the bookstore.”
Archer said the bookstore hopes to continue adding features that respond to students’ demands.
“They keep calling us the bookstore,” he said. “This is just another layer of our services as we migrate to becoming the campus store.”

Armando’s Food Truck, a favorite breakfast and lunch stop among the football team and other students who discovered its slightly obscure location, has moved to a new, off-campus spot since construction began earlier this summer next to the School of Cinematic Arts building.
Order up · Armando Corado takes lunch orders from customers. He said he is optimistic about the increased visibility in his new location. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The move has come as a surprise to some of the old customers and business has taken a bit of a dip, but Armando Corado said he believes  the move might work out for the better.
“The move has definitely changed the business,” Corado said. “We’ve been at that site on USC’s campus for 20 years and we have never worked off campus before.”
The sudden move disrupted regular business, confusing regular customers who didn’t know about the move.
“I just got back to campus after being home for the summer and had no idea Armando’s had moved,” said Jennifer Padilla, a sophomore majoring in international relations and communication. “I was a regular there last year and I doubted they had gone out of business because their tacos are so affordable and in high demand among ’SC students.”
Corado, who has worked at the food truck for 11 years, acknowledged it will take some time to get a regular flow of customers again.
“A lot of people haven’t found us since we moved,” Armando said. “Last year we probably fed about 300 to 400 students a day. Right now, it’s not even close to that, but it will get better.”
Though part of Armando’s reputation as USC’s best-kept secret was based upon the mystery of its location, the new off-campus spot offers the food truck the opportunity to build a bigger customer base.
“Now that I’m off campus, I realize there’s a lot of traffic we hadn’t been exposed to before,” Corado said. “Now many of our customers are living right in front of us.”
Some of those customers live in Century Apartments. Armando’s food truck is now parked outside the apartment complex, near Jefferson Boulevard and McClintock Avenue, each day. Some loyal customers were quick to discover the new location.
“I was bummed out, until I noticed that Armando’s moved right across the street on Jefferson,” said Johnnie Jung, a sophomore majoring in computer engineering and computer science. “I can literally see the truck from my room. Now it’s always tempting me with its awesome sandwiches and burritos — great food and quality.”
Members of the football team said that Armando’s new location won’t change their habits.
“The football team loves the food that the truck has to offer,” said Emon Saee, a walk-on quarterback. “I usually go with [defensive tackle] Christian Tupou or just go pick it up and bring the food back to the locker room. As long the truck is walking distance from the locker room, I’m there.”
Corado said that the food truck might move back to the original location once the construction is completed, but if business goes well enough, the truck would stay on Jefferson and McClintock.
“The way I see it now, we already have a pretty good reputation and a pretty big fanbase,” Corado said. “Now more people can actually see us.”

Professor Miller Fong showed sketches of modern and ancient architecture from around the world at the School of Architecture’s 20 Images X 20 Seconds event Wednesday night, where 10 faculty members each spoke for six minutes and 40 seconds.
Thank you for making me a celebrity and looking good.  The only thing missing, as I told your reporter, I started as a freshman at USC fifty two years ago in 1959.  I can still walk and talk and be a professor at a great University.

As part of an effort to increase efficiency and effectiveness the Undergraduate Student Government is restructuring the way senators interact with student organizations.
USG senators will now visit clubs and groups that have a similar theme, such as academic, community service, arts, political or sports.
Senators are currently required to spend four hours visiting outside organizations each week, but the new system will create “continuity,” said Marissa Roy, the residential senator who headed the effort.
“I think one problem in the past has been that we sometimes don’t have a lot of direction with what our job is,” Roy said. “We do have this wonderful opportunity to define our role in the school because of this flexibility, but there does need to be a little structure sometimes.”
Previously, senators would visit clubs they felt were important, but did not have any specific assignments. Roy said she felt this often prevented senators from building very close relationships with constituents.
“We’re trying to create more continuity and really build relationships with these clubs,” Roy said. “We want senators to become more known about in their chosen field. [By going to meetings with a certain theme group,] I really know what constituents face so I can speak for them in USG and be a better representative for them than if I just went to one meeting once a semester.”
President of USC College Democrats Ximena Velazquez said that her organization had not had much contact with USG in the past, but that having a specific person assigned to contact her group could help them achieve their goals.
“If we can have USG offering support that could really help us,” Velazquez said. “This definitely will be something to try, but until they reach out, we won’t really know if it’s useful or not.”
The ultimate goal of the reorganization is also part of USG’s primary goal: to represent student interests and lobby for them in whatever way possible.
“Student organizations are really the key to getting involved with the student body,” said Vinnie Prasad, USG speaker pro tempore. “With so many student organizations and so many students involved with them, it’s really the most effective way to get in touch.”
Prasad also noted some organizations “slipped under the radar” in the past because senators weren’t always sure which groups were covered, but the new system will ensure all major clubs have direct and consistent contact with USG.
“It’s not just getting our message out to them, but getting their message from that region into USG,” Prasad said. “For example, a senator working with service organizations can report back to philanthropy fund and say what the students involved in service organizations really need.”
Prasad said senators have been really enthusiastic about the system.
“We like the additional structure to make sure that we’re representing everyone,” Prasad said. “This senate has very high ambitions as far as being more connected with the student body.”
Vice President Logan Lachman, who presides over all senate meetings and was a greek senator last year, said the change is a definite improvement.
“This way we’re really able to focus on the bigger picture with each group,” Lachman said. “It’s a condensed version of what senators would be doing anyway, but it’s more efficient.”
The new system was discussed during USG’s Tuesday senate meeting and will be implemented for the remainder of the current senator’s terms.
“There’s a lot of challenges to how we represent the student body,” Prasad said. “There’s almost nothing our entire student body isn’t involved in. We really want to represent all the various segments of the student population and this will help us achieve that.”
