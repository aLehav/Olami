To everyone — the pundit, the avid fan, the man who sells you bacon-wrapped hot dogs on Exposition Boulevard — Lane Kiffin represents a number of things.
To some, he’s a perpetual brat.
To others, he’s a Trojan prince, leading USC back from NCAA sanctions.
Growing up · Though the fourth-youngest head coach in the Football Bowl Subdivision, Kiffin has experienced his share of controversy. – Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
Truth, in turn, becomes muddied, and it’s understandably challenging to decipher fact from fiction. Just who exactly is the Trojans’ third-year coach? Do the stereotypes stick? Is he actually that arrogant? Is he actually the boy wonder?
But answering just yes or no to such sweeping generalities would be dishonest and unfair. I can’t pretend to respond to either, exactly. Many of us cover Lane Kiffin, but how many of us truly know Lane Kiffin on any sort of personal level?
I have interacted with him enough to express a few opinions confidently. For starters, I’ve found him to be thoughtful and calculated — he doesn’t do or say things for the sake of simply doing or saying them. And two, he carries a better sense of humor than he’s given credit for. I like that.
But as many will inevitably point out, that doesn’t mean his record is spotless.
More or less, he comes across as incredibly stubborn.
This is one flaw that has been accentuated in recent weeks, as USC stumbled at Stanford, 21-14, and four days later, he infamously stormed out of a press conference after 29 seconds following a question about the return of an injured player.
“Kiffin is a talented, aggressive recruiter and a decent football strategist whose spoiled-brat arrogance constantly undermines his efforts to become a great coach,” wrote Grantland’s Shane Ryan last month. “He stretches rules, misreads interpersonal situations, and issues the wrong kind of challenges to his enemies. People excuse these as the follies of youth, but that’s a cop-out; they’re the follies of character, and maturity isn’t always related to age.”
Yup, there are flaws. Ryan chooses the term “spoiled-brat arrogance,” which leans toward hyperbole but is unmistakably rooted in reality. Football coaches tend to be stubborn-minded, petty people. They’re often micromanagers. And Kiffin is a football coach, after all.
But the funny thing is, No. 13 USC reversing course this season and meeting its Coliseum-sized preseason expectations largely hinges on whether Kiffin, 37, can still grow as a coach and become less stubborn, and more mature.
Friday indicated this might be possible.
Toward the end of his team’s bye-week practice at Howard Jones Field, Kiffin, fielding questions from a smaller contingent of reporters, at last admitted a rather obvious but important point. As the team’s offensive play caller, he called a subpar game in USC’s mid-September road loss to Stanford — in case anyone wasn’t aware.
“You’d love to have it back but you can’t,” he said. “In coaching, you’re just like players. Every game is not the same. You’re going to have some games where you make some better calls and get in a rhythm. I didn’t feel like I did really well in that game with our players.”
He took blame, and it was refreshing.
What makes this noteworthy is that it was a public admission. For a while now, Kiffin has received a substantial amount of criticism for a failure to take ownership — at least publicly — for events that have transpired during his tenure, including the Stanford game. Usually, he has deferred, highlighting a particular play or circumstance.
But Friday’s admission suggests a lot.
It suggests the “arrogant” coach might be open to honest, self-evaluation. It suggests the coach is receptive to criticism. It suggests the coach can still reflect and look to better himself.
That said, none of the aforementioned possibilities might be true. But I want to be fair and at least give him that chance. Cynicism shouldn’t be our guiding principle. As much time as we’ve invested in thinking about Kiffin, he still hasn’t reached the age of 40 and has only been a head coach for a total of 62 games.
That’s relatively young, which begs the question whether he has room to grow.
The Trojans’ success over the remaining two-thirds of the season will be tied to his ability — or inability — to do so.

USC will get another chance to impress on a national stage this week as it gears up for its Thursday matchup against Utah in Salt Lake City. The last time the Trojans were under the national spotlight was two weeks ago in Palo Alto, Calif. when they were upset by Stanford. Now, coming off a victory over California and a bye week, the team is ready for the next challenge.

“The players are ready to play again after having some extra time off,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “We’re excited for what I think will be a very entertaining game. That place will be rocking as we go in there, and it will be a good test for us.”
Rice-Eccles Stadium is expecting a sellout crowd in what Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said before the season would be one of the biggest games in the school’s history. Utah’s various media outlets echoed this sentiment at Pac-12 Media Day in July.
A lackluster start for Utah, however, has seemingly quelled such rhetoric. After winning their season opener against Northern Colorado in decisive fashion, the Utes faltered in their second game against rival Utah State, losing 27-20 in overtime.
In the loss, senior quarterback Jordan Wynn also suffered a season- and career-ending shoulder injury. Injuries to Utah’s star running back John White and members of its offensive line have rendered the offense inconsistent, as evidenced by the team’s 37-7 loss to Arizona State last week.
Still, regardless of what the Utes have done this season, Kiffin expects a different showing from their offense on Thursday night.
“They’re replacing a lot of linemen, just like us,” Kiffin said. “I anticipate them being at full strength after having some time off, just like us. I think White will be ready to go.”
In last season’s meeting, the Trojans’ defense held White to just 56 rushing yards on 20 carries — a far cry from his 2011 season average of 116 yards per game.
The star for Utah in last year’s meeting was receiver Devante Christopher, who had 11 catches for 136 yards. Even with new quarterback Jon Hays, who has a 6-3 career starting record, the USC secondary will face challenges against the Utes’ passing attack, particularly at the second cornerback spot opposite junior Nickell Robey.
“We need to play better at the other spot and force them to throw at [Robey],” Kiffin said. “Right now, nobody’s throwing at him.”
Kiffin hopes another defender will emerge opposite Robey so that the lockdown corner can have more opportunities to make plays on the ball and get turnovers.
“There’s no secret. We haven’t played well there all year,” Kiffin said in reference to the second cornerback spot. “It’s unfortunate for Nickell, because the ball is always going the other way. We have to be more consistent in tackling and in press coverage.”

The No. 1 USC men’s water polo team racked up five more victories over the weekend en route to its ninth SoCal tournament championship in  10  years, defeating UC Santa Barbara 14-5 in the championship game. The four-game tournament sweep came after a 22-5 victory over  Princeton on Friday.
Different story · USC finished a disappointing fourth in last year’s SoCal tournament, dropping two of the three games it lost in 2011. After Sunday’s SoCal tournament championship win, USC is now 14-0 to begin the season. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
“We looked very good,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “Our defense was very consistent each game, and offensively we did a better job at finishing our high percentage opportunities. I was very pleased with how we played.”
The Trojans’ tournament crown redeeems them from last year’s disappointing showing, in which the team lost two games in a row to place fourth.
“Last year was disappointing,” junior two-meter Jeremy Davie said. “We used that to motivate us for this year. We didn’t want to have that result again. We watched the tape from last year, and we were very well-prepared for this weekend.”
The star of the tournament was junior driver Nikola Vavic, who scored 16 goals over the five-game weekend, including a career-high six in the finals victory.
“Nikola so far has had a very good year,” Jovan Vavic said. “He’s not only scoring, which he has always been able to do, but he is also making assists and making his teammates better.”
The team got off to a hot start Friday, dismantling Princeton at the outset of the game and displaying excellent focus. With the tough task of playing five games in three days, team captains stressed the importance of concentrating on the task at hand — rather than the long slate of games — to remain sharp.
“We address complacency whenever we see it,” senior driver Andrew Reego said. “We get on guys, we’ll meet as a team to assess why we’re playing or practicing poorly and we’ll get back on track.”
That drive was evident this weekend, as USC wasted no time jumping ahead in its opening round game against St. Francis. Vavic led the way with four goals while Davie chipped in three to provide sophomore goalie Ely Bonilla all the cushion he needed as the team won 15-4.
In the second-round matchup, USC faced fellow Mountain Pacific Sports Federation foe No. 8 Pacific. The Tigers put up more of a fight, but the Trojans were able to tame them with three goals from sophomore driver Kostas Genidounias, winning by a score of 9-4.
On Sunday, USC was able to do what it could not in last year’s tournament: avoid the crushing upset. This proved to be a challenge for other highly ranked teams in the field, however, as both No. 4 Cal and No. 2 UCLA tripped up on their way to the championship game. As a result, USC played No. 5 UC Irvine in the semifinals, winning by a score of 10-5.
After an evenly played first quarter, the Trojans scored five unanswered goals in the second and third periods to distance themselves from the Anteaters. Once again, Vavic and Genidounias led the team’s scoring, tallying three goals apiece. Bonilla and junior goalie James Clark split time in the cage and made 12 saves total — eight for Bonilla and four for Clark.
“Both of our goalies are excellent,” Jovan Vavic said. “They did a great job for us. We improved our team defense. Our players were more aware, they communicated better. I was very pleased with our younger players. They played significant minutes, and they played well.”
In the championship game, USC took on host No. 6 UC Santa Barbara after the Gauchos upset No. 2 UCLA.
UCSB was unable to capitalize on its home-court advantage, as the Trojans raced ahead of the Gauchos, with Nikola Vavic scoring the first three goals of the game. After UCSB cut the lead to 4-2 in the first quarter, USC went on a scoring run with goals by Genidounias and junior two-meter Connor Virjee to push the lead to 9-3 at halftime.
The onslaught would continue in the second half, as Clark and the Trojans defense shut out UCSB in the third quarter to give the team an 11-3 lead heading into the fourth. With the result secured for all intents and purposes, the two sides alternated goals to push the final score to 14-5.
“[Nikola Vavic and Genidounias] are both very talented offensively,” Jovan Vavic said. “They are difficult to defend because they have multiple weapons. Not only are they scoring, but they actually lead the team in assists. They do a great job of setting other people up as well.”
The successful weekend boosts the Trojans to 14-0 on the season and leaves them in top form. Though the team is pleased with its results to date, Jovan Vavic stressed that his players are looking forward to the next challenge.
“One of the keys in having a successful season is not getting too high or too low,” Jovan Vavic said. “We have good leadership on our team. Our guys know that this is not a sprint, it’s a marathon. Our players are mature enough to understand this.”
The team will have the week off before heading north to face conference rival No. 3 Stanford on Saturday, providing USC with yet another test against a national power.
“Three years ago, we went to Stanford and did not play well,” Jovan Vavic said. “They had a large crowd, we had a tough time scoring and they beat us. We know how difficult that place is to play, and we’re going to be ready.”

Gov. Jerry Brown signed two bills into law Thursday that ban California employers and universities from requesting access to applicants’ social media accounts, making California the state with the strictest social media privacy laws.
Assembly Bill 1844, written by Assemblywoman Nora Campos, prohibits employers from asking for social media usernames and passwords from current employees and job candidates. Senate Bill 1349, written by Senator Leland Yee, prohibits public and private California universities from asking students or prospective students to disclose their usernames and passwords.
Appropriately, Brown announced the signing of the two measures on his Twitter account.
California is the fourth state to enact such a ban. Earlier this year, Maryland and Illinois passed laws protecting worker privacy, and Delaware passed a similar law for students. California, however, is the first state to apply the ban to both employers and universities.
Brown said he saw California as a trendsetter in the matter.
“California pioneered the social media revolution,” Brown posted on Facebook. “These laws protect Californians from unwarranted invasions of their social media accounts.”
Karen North, director of the Annenberg Program on Online Communities and an expert in social media and Internet privacy, agreed with the governor.
“We are so big and powerful in California, we can be precedent-setting,” North said. “The rest of the country looks to us to make decisions about the digital experience.”
Close to a dozen states around the country are currently considering their own social media privacy bills, including New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts. The bills are especially relevant in the middle of an era of increasing social media presence in college and job applications.
Some companies require candidates to undergo “shoulder surfing” — systematically clicking through their Facebook account under the supervision of an employer — during interviews. A few colleges, such as the University of North Carolina, also require student-athletes to give their Facebook passwords to school officials.
According to North, companies and universities want to use social media to get an “accurate representation” of potential candidates.
“If they can peer into the individual’s private life — the life that is not influenced by professional pressures — they can get a better sense of who the applicant is,” North said.
The bills, however, do not prohibit companies or universities from looking up applicants online or from viewing applicant’s Facebook profiles if they are public.
North said she would still advise that regardless of new legislation, students to be wary of what they post online.
“Anything you do on social media, you should consider it to be public,” she said. “It’s way too easy these days [for companies] to see your digital imprint on the world.”
Some students, such as Chris Lee, a junior majoring in business administration, agreed with the bills with a few caveats.
“I don’t want USC or any other school invading my privacy, but they should still be able to check for stuff that might harm the university,” Lee said.
In fact, employers can still ask for social media information if it is relevant to an investigation and colleges can still “protect against and investigate alleged student misconduct or violations of applicable laws and regulations,” according to SB 1349.
When asked if he would still attend USC if the school required him to divulge his Facebook password, Lee was hesitant.
“Probably not,” he said. “But maybe for a job I would.”
Come Jan. 1, that should not be a problem.

Monday marked Steve A. Kay’s first day as the 21st dean of the Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, where he said he is excited to play a role in working with students in addition to expanding the school’s opportunities and programs.

“When I came to interview at USC, the clincher for me was really walking around the campus,” Kay said. “I saw such energy amongst the students.”
Kay came to Dornsife from UC San Diego, where he served as dean of the division of biological sciences and held the Richard C. Atkinson Chair in biological sciences. He also served as a distinguished professor of cell and developmental biology. Prior to working at UCSD, Kay held positions at Rockefeller University, the University of Virginia and the Scripps Research Institute.
Kay said he is looking forward to starting his work at Dornsife and building on the college’s current programs, largely by working hand-in-hand with faculty and staff.
“The first goal I have for Dornsife is to listen [to staff and faculty],” he said. “Listen to them about what they view as the most exciting opportunities and goals. I see us as being able to be very nimble in terms of identifying the areas where we can achieve very rapid progress.”
Kay received his Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Bristol, United Kingdom and continued his research in genetics and genomics, becoming one of the world’s top experts on genes and circadian rhythms. He has published more than 200 papers and has had research cited in Science magazine’s “Breakthroughs of the Year” in 1997, 1998 and 2002.
As the head of Dornsife, Kay has several goals for his tenure, including more research and hands-on opportunities for students.
Kay’s background in the sciences has him looking forward to a few changes at Dornsife.
“We have plans to be building a new science building on campus,” Kay said. “That’s something I look forward to being a part of.”
He said he also hopes to expand the interdisciplinary programs, such as the philosophy, politics and law major.
“I think that seeking out ways in which we can look at fields that are not traditionally put together is one of the areas that offers many opportunities,” Kay said.
Personal connection with students is also important to Kay. Through the course of his professional life, Kay has had more than 50 of his former Ph.D. students of his become faculty chairs and administrators at other universities across the country. When he was dean at UCSD, Kay led a large academic division with almost 6,000 undergraduates, hundreds of graduates and postdoctoral researchers, as well as four faculty departments.
“I feel incredibly lucky to have worked with so many influential students and researchers,” Kay said.
In reference to his new position, Kay emphasized the importance of using education as a means of benefiting society.
“I believe very much that education is really the most powerful tool we have for the development of human capital,” Kay said.

As the Los Angeles Police Department adds more officers to the USC area, the number of citations for traffic and biking infractions among students has increased. This greater presence around campus comes from a request from the university to further ensure student safety, according to the LAPD.
Traffic jam · The heavily traversed intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and McClintock Avenue is one of several areas near campus that the Los Angeles Police Department has added extra officers to patrol. – Arya Harsono | Daily Trojan
LAPD officers have replaced the Dept. of Public Safety at some intersections, and are now positioned on the perimeter of campus to monitor students when crossing the streets in the area.
DPS officers now monitor the new bike lanes within the University Park campus. Though DPS focuses mostly on warning riders to follow the rules, LAPD uses citations to help change rider and pedestrian behavior.
LAPD officers are focused on specific violations to make the university safer for students.
“They’re really basic laws,” said Nichol Gardner, the Southwest Division senior lead officer of the LAPD. “I tell my officers to stress to students that they should be safe while riding their bikes and crossing the streets. That means riding with the flow of traffic, not being on your cell phone and not crossing when the red hand is flashing.”
Despite the additional efforts to reduce traffic violations, some students believe tighter enforcement will not change student behavior for the right reasons.
Jackie Drobny, a junior majoring in communication, received a citation that came with a $197 fine last month for not crossing the street at an intersection.
“I don’t think giving kids citations is the way to solve problems,” Drobny said. “Now I’ve stopped jaywalking out of fear that I will have to pay $200 again, but not because I was unsafe and I’m now being safer.”
Traffic accidents and violations on campus often result from these kinds of infractions, according to DPS. Many students acknowledged the problem with traffic and biking violations on campus, but said they believe that the LAPD can solve them with more effective methods.
“I think [safety] is a legitimate concern, but I think LAPD is too overzealous about it,” Terrence Liu, a junior majoring in biochemistry, said. “I understand why LAPD would enforce these laws, but students shouldn’t have to pay for violations.”
Other students said they do not believe that LAPD is targeting the correct problem.
“I’m from Philadelphia and no police officer would ever give you a ticket for jaywalking, because there’s just bigger issues,” Drobny said. “The streets should be more walker- and biker-friendly.”
Some students feel that they are at a disadvantage because they are not aware of California traffic infractions.
“I think it would be better if they informed us about the laws,” said Soumya Murag, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering. “Because now I’m just finding new paths around campus, away from the officers, to ride my bike.”
Despite student opposition to being penalized, DPS Capt. David Carlisle says that the department could start curbing biking problems on campus by using citations.
“DPS has not written any citations yet,” Carlisle said. “We focus on the roadways in campus where most of the foot traffic is. DPS may, in the future, start enforcing them soon for failure for following the bike lanes, though.”
Some also expressed concern that LAPD is specifically targeting university students because of their inability to fight the citations in court.
“They know that students are not going to fight [citations], along with the fact that they are not there every day enforcing it shows me that they’re making a lot of money off of it, which just seems wrong,” Drobny said.
LAPD, however, maintained that its primary job is to encourage more street safety among USC students.
“We just want students to act smart when they’re on the street,” Gardner said. “They just need to make sure that they’re aware of everyone’s safety when on bikes and walking.”
Was out at lunch and saw swarms of LAPD motorcycle officers looking to cite pedestrians and bike riders. The cyclists I saw being ticketed did not appear to me to be any sort of safety threat. I hope they have the time and opportunity to fight the citation using the municipal codes referenced in another comment here.
For the university to turn a blind eye to students being harvested for city revenue in this manner is like watching bears go on a salmon feeding frenzy (I saw a similar situation crossing into Mexico for a Baja 1000 race). The university and students are trying to promote sustainable practices. They need to research and post the L.A.M.C. ordinances and request law enforcement specify how they’ll be enforcing these statutes and do so in a sensible and consistent manner.
Know your rights. Great L.A.M.C. info in this DT article provided in the comments.
(LAPD and DPS to ramp up bike safety – Daily Trojan 9/15/2009)
For Trojan  staff and students:
A quick reminder on the metro line crossings as I got a warning but no citation (3-4 weeks ago). 
I was westbound by bike on the south side of Jefferson crossing Flower. I was on the sidewalk but rode through the crosswalk. The Sheriff’s motorcycle officer motioned me over and said he could have cited me for riding against traffic implying that if I rode through the crosswalk on the north side of the street, I would have been OK. I asked if then it wasn’t technically a violation to ride on the sidewalk as well. He said that was up to the LAPD and the court would make that determination if one contested the ticket and that he was just there to monitor the train crossing.
For clarification I said that I could either follow the rules of the road for vehicle traffic, or operate as a pedestrian (meaning always walking the bike through the crosswalk), but not both. He confirmed that understanding.
In summation, the previous “grace period” may be over. 
Always ride with traffic no matter what. Always walk your bike through the crosswalk though in the deputy’s explanation, they would understand hugging/drifting into the edge of the crosswalk if you were going with the flow of traffic while following vehicle code road rules. Riding the sidewalk is still up in the air in terms of the discretion of the officer.
The funny thing was that while I was waiting behind the gate (with the gate open – I confirmed with the Metro observer that that was OK), there were four people all waiting *past* the gate in the “KEEP CLEAR” area which would have put them 12 inches away from a train if it went by. As was explained in the Metro information sessions, they could have been subject to “trespassing” citations. The officer chose not to alert them of this even though that seemed a greater safety issue.
Hope this helps anyone on bike avoid any headaches. I’ve tried to bring this to the attention of fellow riders, but still saw a young female student ticketed last Friday for what I received a warning for. Enforcement seems pretty uneven and depends entirely on the officer. Local law enforcement needs to think about their role in the community, and true safety and sustainability, and not just revenue generation.
LAPD should stay out of the USC area altogether and let all the students get run over / shot by the locals.  Go Bruins!
25+ years ago LAPD was Giving unnecessary tickets to students to generate revenue.  I believe they should be out preventing real crime…much to choose from around SC I believe.  Picking on kids riding on handle bars, going to class isn’t going to prevent robberies, murders, gangs, etc
LAPD should be stopping locals and making sure they’re not stealing stuff, not harassing students for nonissues like bike citations. LAPD, where are your balls?
Students may not appreciate it but your safety is a concern.
My pet peeve with bike riders: Wrong way bike riders on marked bicycle lanes. (ditto for sidewalks)
A motorist does not expect to see a cyclist coming in the wrong direction at high speed at an intersection. Narrow misses have been frequent and inevitably the cyclist glares as if the motorist is in the wrong. 
Wise up!
Grandma checking in again….
2 students get shot outside their home and LAPD responds by sending more officers to USC to write $200 jaywalking and biking tickets…
Wow I cant believe some of these reactions from students! LOL!

In the quiet of an art museum, a single onlooker stops in front of a painting and stares. What does he or she look at: The way the colors appear as the light hits the canvas? The complex elegance of the giant frame around the work?
Well, thanks to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art’s new project, you might encounter  the same experience from the street. “Wear LACMA” will allow you to walk out of the museum with some of its best artwork printed onto high-end clothing.
A collaboration with fashion lines, including Libertine and Gregory Parkinson, will join the many artsy trinkets at the LACMA store beginning Oct. 5. The money from these sales will go straight to the museum, so even though you’re only buying a replica of a work, you’re helping keep the originals in their home.
Now art lovers can strut the streets wearing a classic portrait as part of their outfit. But what, or whom, exactly are they sporting?
One of the first creations to come from this collaboration features Thomas Lawrence’s Portrait of Arthur Atherley as an Etonian on Libertine T-shirts. Only 200 of these shirts will be made in total — 100 for each gender.
At its most basic, the work portrays a confident young man who just graduated from Eton College (if only our senior portraits matched the fanciness of 1791). Atherley faces the audience directly, posing with one hand holding his hat and the other casually on his hip. He obviously wears expensive clothing, and a seemingly turbulent sky serves as his backdrop, lending the work a dramatic aura rare in portraits.
The work not only helps show off an important art form — the portrait — it also serves to deliver a message about the art in LACMA: Though you might need to pay admission to get in, the museum’s artworks do not keep quiet.
Atherley’s gaze commands your attention and foreshadows his important future role as a three-term representative of Southampton in the British Parliament.
But even if a viewer saw the work without knowing Atherley’s history, much of his high class standing and potential would come across. The youthful figure appears confident and obviously takes his looks into consideration.
Lawrence depicts Atherley half in shadows, giving him an elusive, almost sinister aura. The tree on the right in the background gives a sense of distance but also makes Atherley look larger-than-life as he seems to tower over the tree and almost the rest of the landscape. The gloomy nature scene itself seems to hint at the coming of a storm — perhaps less reflective of the weather than of the commanding nature of Atherley himself.
Surely some art enthusiasts might view the T-shirts and other creations in a negative light, as they seem to put revered artworks on the same level as other common brands and logos on shirts. Maybe Atherley’s portrait most appropriately belongs in the usual museum setting than on a shirt that will undergo wear and tumble around in a laundry machine time and time again. Furthermore, and maybe most controversially, the image has been altered, displaying Atherley without the painting’s background.
But LACMA’s motive perhaps lies not in lowering the status of these works but in raising them in the minds of both the wearers and a larger audience — those who see the shirt on a passing stranger.
The T-shirt itself sets up Atherley as an intriguing fashion figure from another era while identifying Lawrence’s work as an important piece in the history of portraiture. The simplified design sans background sets Atherley up as a symbol of the direct communication between art and the viewer; even on a shirt Atherley commands the viewer’s attention. Fashionistas might wear him as the mini version of a great artwork or as an image showing the evolution of personal image and portraits from then to now.
For fashion lovers as well, the Atherley T-shirt proves a particularly fascinating look into the history of men’s fashion; one will show an appreciation for eleaborate fashion through that simplest of apparel — the white tee.
Ideally, these works will leave the museum and engage with the community in a larger sense, hopefully in a manner that will have someone asking where they can see the original.
LACMA will continue adding more designers to the project and more items will come to the store during the winter. Meanwhile, the artworks inside the museum wait patiently for another person to stand across from them — perhaps a new viewer — and take in their history and beauty.

Vegan lovers and health nuts alike eagerly awaited the August opening of Localita & The Badasserie, the little sister to Hollywood’s beloved deli market, Locali.
Shelved sides · In addition to the homemade soups, breads and gluten-free cookies at Localita & The Badasserie in Downtown’s Fashion District, one can also enjoy an array of health-minded drinks and chips. Given the restaurant’s cramped and uninviting space, one should opt for takeout and delivery. – Rachel Niemoller | Daily Trojan
And yet to call the offshoot “little” is an understatement; this self-proclaimed “world’s smallest quick service restaurant” takes hole-in-the-wall dining to another level, occupying a mere 80 square feet of Downtown’s bustling Fashion District.
The vegan hot spot offers a variety of specialty goodies, including homemade soups, gluten-free cookies, organic chocolate-raspberry energy shots, spirulina-and-banana flax seed bars, among other health-infused snacks. But while the food is solid, the ambiance might make you question a return visit.
Localita’s constantly changing menu is far from pretentious, contrary to what connoisseurs might anticipate in such a trendy, health-crazed city.  What’s presented is not your typical herbivore cuisine: Soul-enriched  sandwich options include the popular Baaadasss breakfast sandwich, The Sir Nasty and the S. Daddy Mack, amid other items named with the eatery’s simple-but-sassy attitude in mind.
The Baaadasss Breakfast Sandwich  is nothing short of its title. This maple-syrup-infused sausage and soy-free cheddar monster, lathered with vegan chipotle sauce and encased in a sprouted multigrain English muffin, provides a unique sensory experience. One bite into this rich and peculiar combo will leave one’s palate intrigued; a second sampling might leave one’s taste buds more puzzled.
The Reuben was voted the best of its kind in Los Angeles, or so claims the artisan sandwich menu. This take on the classic lunch item layers slices of savory, marinated tofu with “cheese” and sauerkraut, all topped with homemade Russian dressing and served on rye bread. Though it might never attract as much attention as its predecessor, this sandwich does come close in comparison.
Another favorite of vegan regulars is The Luigi Lover. The vegan sausage and soy-free mozzarella sandwich, smothered in homemade marinara sauce and served on Localita’s popular English muffin, seems characteristic of the meatball sub one might find at a local pizzeria. Vegan-Italian, anyone?
A word to the wise when ordering:  Don’t ignore the smoothie. This corner of the menu upholds the most intriguing — and not to mention wholesome — reputation among Localita’s ranging possibilities and caters to even the most discerning of taste buds. Choose from their recommended organic concoctions, or better yet, create a custom blend.
Select either The Rebuild (hemp milk, coconut kefir and banana) or The Refresh (apple cider and mixed berries) as a base, and then go crazy with add-ons, such as cacao nibs, matcha powder, sunflower seed butter or maca root. Even if half of these ingredients sound foreign, creating something to fit your liking won’t be difficult.
The Berry Good is entirely worthy of an honorable mention. Its tangy goodness — a product of fresh berries and sweet apple cider, enriched with coconut kefir and matcha green tea powder — truly delivers.
Candy Girl also deserves a spot on the potential prospect list. Though one of the more mellow smoothies, its nutty banana flavor and chocolate coconut undertones make for a guilt-free indulgence — a perfect post-workout sip or afternoon pick-me-up.
If one thing can be said for certain about this little health bar, it’s that it loves to treat its vegan patrons. Take full advantage of the wall of goodies by grabbing a bag of veggie chips, some Texas BBQ Primal beef jerky strips, a stick of black licorice or satisfying that sweet tooth craving with something from the assorted vegan cookie case (but don’t bother with the chocolate chip, which simply can’t measure up to the real thing). For those feeling more well-behaved, spring for a fruit chew, cinnamon-raisin Bobo’s Oat Bar or seaweed Sea Snax. One might opt to pair a snack with a beverage from the wide selection of organic teas, agave-based sodas and naturally flavored waters.
Localita sets itself apart from any other Downtown eatery. It’s the only place around these parts where you can find guilt-free pizza sausage and coconut-kefir and matcha berry smoothies on the same menu.
The ambiance, however, is far from enjoyable. Much of this stems from the Localita’s less-than-ideal Fashion District location, which puts a damper on the dining experience and reduces appreciation for Localita’s tasty offerings. The spot certainly deserves credit for its efforts in providing healthy alternatives to a fast-food-infiltrated neighborhood, but choosing to open a “restaurant” in a hallway next door to a shoeshine booth will never be a good idea. The lack of dining space, the grungy feel and the pungent aroma of the Fashion District is not exactly enticing or worthy enough to inspire a second trip.
That said, don’t completely rule Localita out on your next trek Downtown. Avoid the less-than-appetizing scene by ordering takeout or — better yet — delivery. Localita’s eco-friendly bike service will carry meals to any Downtown  doorstep. Move your meal to the comfort of your apartment or office, and your taste buds will thank you.
 
Localita & The Badasserie is located on 817 S. Los Angeles St., and is open Monday through Saturday, 8  a.m. to 5  p.m.

Pitch Perfect hits theaters in an era where society constantly tells us — thanks to TV shows and movies like Glee, American Idol or High School Musical — that music and dance provide expressive outlets for socially awkward underdogs. This story has been done so many times and in so many different scenarios that the healing power of music has quickly turned into a cliché.Pitch Perfect is no exception.
But though the film boasts nothing but predictable storylines, and the characters resemble carbon-copy archetypes of every “team-overcoming-everything” story, Pitch Perfect manages to turn something familiar into a fully entertaining spectacle — just as its a cappella groups revitalize popular songs with the right amount of rhythm, charm and laughs.
The movie follows Barden University freshman Beca (Anna Kendrick), who, under her father’s pressure to make friends and because of her attraction to music, decides to join The Bellas, an all-female a cappella group. The Bellas — filled with myriad eccentric characters including a control freak, a near-mute pyromaniac and a girl that calls herself Fat Amy — are attempting to redeem themselves after an embarrassing loss at Nationals.
The audience knows what’s going to happen before the movie even begins. Spoiler alert: The Bellas are going to win nationals and Beca is going to end up with Jesse (Skylar Astin), even though he’s a member of the rival group. Yes, Pitch Perfect is that kind of film. But though the audience might predict every element of the plot, that’s ok: a sophisticated narrative not the point of the story.
Pitch Perfect’s goal is really to take us through a journey filled with enchanting performances and mind-blowing vocal numbers.
That’s not to say the story is not filled with wit and hilarity. Most of the comedy is dialogue-based (the use of the prefix “a ca-” to everything never gets a ca-old), which is appreciated given the characters’ witty banter. But the comedy extends past the lead actors’ lines. Even the competition narrations alone are enough to fill a Twitter comedy account for days.
Pitch Perfect also dazzles with charming performances. Anna Kendrick charms her way into one of her first lead performances as Beca, the alternative chick with the hidden talents that will save the doomed group. Kendrick is cute, likable and vocally talented: She holds her own throughout the entire film, although it’s mainly because she is supported by equally good performances from her fellow Bellas.
There’s Brittany Snow as Chloe and Anna Camp as Audrey, the group veterans that resist any sort of change to their traditional performances — at first. Their performances might seem kind of cartoonish, but audiences buy that because Snow and Camp can sing in perfect harmony. Then there’s Skylar Astin as the completely dreamy and just-as-talented love interest, Jesse, who doesn’t seem to show a single flaw throughout the entire film.
Elizabeth Banks (who also happens to be one of the producers of the movie) and John Michael Higgins appear in small roles as the hilarious competition commentators. They are definitely one of the highlights of the film, and arguably deliver the funniest lines. The cameo appearance of Christopher Mintz-Plasse (a.k.a. McLovin’ from Superbad) is also a treat.
Finally, there’s Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy. Wilson undeniably steals every scene and garners laughs from every piece of dialogue she delivers. Wilson has a true talent for comedy, and this role serves as her perfect outlet, even more so than her role in last year’s Bridesmaids. Keep an eye on her. She’s going to be big — and not “fat” big, either.
But Pitch Perfect would not be as entertaining if it weren’t for the true protagonists of the movie: the musical numbers. Anyone who’s been to an a cappella show can attest to the fact that its attraction and appeal lies in energetic performances and vocal arrangements made from popular songs.
Pitch Perfect delivers this. From an outstandingly edited and framed rendition of Kelly Clarkson’s “Since U Been Gone” to the film’s fantastic final number, which takes snippets from popular pop songs and old classics, Pitch Perfect astounds. If the performances or story aren’t strong enough, the numbers will surely steal at least a couple of smiles from even the most skeptical viewers.
Pitch Perfect will not make history of any kind and is not a milestone inside the breakout-in-song-and-feel-better genre. It is, however, time (and money) well spent. The razzle-dazzle of the numbers and charm of the performances are enough to compensate for the flaws and predictability of the script.
But that’s sometimes what audiences need: a simple, mindless, fun movie that reminds them singing along is just fine.

Writer-director Rian Johnson has put together quite a resume.
In 2005, his debut independent feature film Brick, a film noir set around a high school, released to critical acclaim. Brick starred a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt and served as the actor’s breakout role.
Tough guy · Bruce Willis stars as old Joe in Looper. Though known for playing hardened characters in films such as Die Hard and Red, Willis shows audiences that he can convey deeper emotion in his latest work. – | Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures
Seven years and two Breaking Bad episodes later, Rian Johnson has once again teamed up with Gordon-Levitt to create a mentally engaging and massively creative product, this time in the form of Looper.
The year is 2044 and, by the looks of things, the world has spiraled downward. Sure, levitating motorcycles and transparent phones have been invented, but the large number of homeless vagrants and the overall decrepit state of society make for a net loss. Along with levitating motorcycles, the year 2044 also features “loopers,” one of whom is Joe (Gordon-Levitt). He explains in the film’s opening scene that time travel has not yet been invented, but by 2070 it will be, soon to be exploited, of course, by crime syndicates as an efficient method of removing problematic individuals. The future crimelords send their victims back to 2044 where loopers like Joe finish the job and dispose of the body — a body that technically doesn’t exist yet. The twist comes when  Joe is confronted with the task of killing his future self (Bruce Willis) — and with that, Looper takes off.
Though a summary of the film’s plot might make this movie sound like a complicated sci-fi adventure focused on the intricacies of time travel, the actual film is far from convoluted. Looper is grounded in its two lead characters, each of which is equipped with an interesting story, some endearing qualities and a gun.
2044 Joe is a drug-addicted, prostitute-chasing killer, but you can’t help but root for him because of Gordon-Levitt’s magnetic likability. Often criticized for playing one-note characters in films such as Inception and The Dark Knight Rises, Gordon-Levitt is more than impressive here, displaying some serious acting chops and owning his role. This performance should put to rest any qualms regarding his ability to carry a project. And considering the string of lead roles he’s put together over recent years (50/50, Premium Rush and (500) Days of Summer), expect him to maintain his spot as one of Hollywood’s premier lead men.
Meanwhile, Bruce Willis exhibits his best work in many years playing 2072 Joe. He doesn’t physically resemble Gordon-Levitt, but suspending disbelief shouldn’t be a problem with a movie that uses time travel as a narrative device. Old Joe has been hardened by many years on the job, and now he only cares about one thing: the love of his life. Oh, and saving the world from a mysterious criminal named “The Rainmaker.”
Regardless, Bruce Willis is still a great actor, and it’s about time he reminded the world that he can show some emotion.
The supporting cast is rounded out by Jeff Daniels, Emily Blunt and child-actor Pierce Gagnon. Daniels plays Abe, a major player of the future-times crime syndicate who has been sent back in time to handle the logistics of the enterprise (and to provide comic relief). Blunt, sporting an American accent, plays Sara, an imaginary-cigarette-smoking, shotgun-toting farmer and mother of one. Gagnon plays her 10-year-old son Cid, the cutest and most spunky little boy imaginable. The multitude of emotions reflected in his tiny face reveals a young actor who has the honest talent necessary to remain in the movie business long after his cuteness fades.
Looper stuns visually. The cinematography is beautiful and subtle, rife with details like the light illuminating from Joe’s refrigerator in a particularly gorgeous scene. Johnson has constructed an all-encompassing texture that makes the film vividly striking.
In addition, the film is mostly slow-paced, with sporadic high-tension action scenes strewn through. These sequences are shot with goosebump-inducing precision and prove that Johnson is a director thoroughly on top of his game and in command of his craft.
The narrative also moves brilliantly. Looper hinges on the inherent and fascinating paradox of time travel: If you change something about the past, will the future be avoided?
Joe knows that his future will one day have him looking down the barrel of his own gun (or as it’s called in 2044, a blunderbuss), and he is determined to prevent that from happening.
The events that ensue because of his determination to change his fate make for a visually astonishing and ridiculously entertaining ride into the future. Ranging from a thriller to a love story, Looper creates the perfect blend of all.
Looper is one of the best films of the year and presents a director/actor tandem in Rian Johnson and Joseph Gordon-Levitt that will be a force to be reckoned with for years to come.

Last week, McDonald’s became the first major fast-food chain to post calorie contents on all drive-thru and in-store menus.
The change is a result of growing waistlines and, consequently, public officials’ and media outlets’ condemnation one of the world’s largest and most popular calorie producers. It’s happening everywhere: In the past year, New York City pushed legislation through that imposes limits on soda cup volumes, Los Angeles proposed a similar ban to make city parks and libraries soda-free and Olympic officials were pressured to ban Coca-Cola and McDonald’s from sponsoring the 2012 London Olympics.

But fast-food restaurants such as McDonald’s are used as scapegoats for America’s obesity epidemic and addiction to fast food and thus, are subject to unfair legislation. A federal calorie-posting mandate issued as part of Obama’s new health care law, which only applies to fast food chains with more than 20 locations and no other restaurants, is an example of that. But this action is misguided and dangerous, as it misleads consumers to believe they are making healthier choices while encouraging misconceptions and greater inaction from the public and fast-food restaurants alike.
Though the new trend of posting calorie counts seems like a step in the right direction, consumers that face new calorie information and healthier options might be deluded into thinking that the decisions they make are sound nutritional ones. Having to face just how many calories are in that Big Mac will surely dissuade some customers from ordering calorie-laden goods, but it creates a red herring in the discourse surrounding better eating habits, which involve more than just calories. McDonald’s new menu boards give the illusion that by choosing lower calorie options, consumers are being more health-conscious, even in spite of the fact that calorie counts lend almost no help to understanding the nutritional value of a food item. Thus, these new menu boards simply distract consumers from more important health concerns while convincing them that they are taking control of their diets.
Not to mention, only forcing fast-food chains to post calorie counts fosters the misconception that fast food from a major chain is somehow inherently worse than food ordered anywhere else. Americans can order 1,000-calorie cheeseburger meals with fries at tens of thousands of sit-down restaurants, many of which would not need to post calorie information on their menus. Such selective legislation plays off the accessibility and ubiquity of fast-food restaurants that makes these companies seem so threatening to impulsive and irresponsible consumers. In reality, however, it only singles out one player in the problem of unhealthy foods while ignoring the overall issue.
In response to such criticism, fast- food establishments across the country are making efforts to offer broader and healthier options in every menu category. For example, apple slices have replaced or complemented French fries in many McDonald’s meals: The fast-food giant is now the largest buyer of apples in the United States.
But though McDonald’s response to public outcry might result in some good short-term benefits — adding a serving of fruit to each Happy Meal is certainly beneficial — the long-term benefits of such policies are questionable.
As the pressure to promote public health increasingly falls on suppliers rather than consumers, fast-food companies will adapt to public demands in counterproductive ways, with new options developed to maintain consumer satisfaction and to placate critics without addressing major health problems in any serious and significant way.
Perhaps worst of all, media outlets and public officials that shift blame for American obesity onto fast-food companies only further the misconception that these companies are somehow more responsible for individuals’ health problems than anything else.
We are the generation that will have no choice but to face the problems that come with America’s dependence on fast food. Without an understanding and acknowledgment of the choices that we, not fast-food corporations or restaurants, make that lead to our poor health, it will be all too easy to fall back on this convenient scapegoat model. Students — as future leaders and as young people brought up in an era that knows more about food than any other — have a responsibility to hold themselves and the American public accountable for the choices they make.

Great article, Ryan. Its about time individuals began taking responsibility for their own health and stopped blaming others for their own failings. And I didn’t even think of the point that it does create the illusion that fast food companies are inherently bad from singling them out. The Blame Game is the best column this newspaper has to offer!

How often do people stop to think about the genetic makeup of their food? Not often enough.
An upcoming state ballot measure, Proposition 37, aims to generate awareness about that topic by requiring genetically engineered food to be labeled as such. Prop. 37 is a necessary call for transparency and awareness in an industry and society that desperately needs both.
Prop. 37 is a result of the growing use of genetically modified organisms in the American food industry. GMOs are organisms whose genetic makeup is changed to produce certain desirable characteristics, such as tomatoes whose genes are tweaked so they have a longer shelf life. Today, nearly 90 percent of all domestic corn and soybean products are genetically engineered, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
If these practices are so commonplace, what advantage is there to labeling all GMO products? The answer: consumer knowledge. For the extent that GMOs are incorporated into our food, few people actually understand their implications and some people are entirely unaware of their existence.
Admittedly, GMOs are a viable way to ensure greater agricultural yield for an ever-growing population’s food needs, but it will be up to today’s students to handle their side effects and improve current genetic engineering methods. Regardless of whether one believes GMOs are good or bad, they are an important part of the future. Voting “yes” on Prop. 37 means catapulting this important phenomenon into public discourse.
It is not to say that people should not eat any genetically engineered foods. But GMOs are a new development and the long-term health consequences of eating GMOs have yet to be studied, so consumers should be cautious and able to make informed decisions.
Opponents of Prop. 37 argue that the measure would increase food prices. But prices would only significantly increase if companies decided to substitute GMOs for more expensive food items, such as organic products. But this isn’t likely to happen. Most companies can rely on the fact that many people see no need to change the food products they have been eating for years, so neither does the company that sells them.
A second critique — that Prop. 37 would create undue alarm — is unfounded. Any alarm the label generates is not unwarranted: People should be informed of the extent to which their food is genetically manipulated. But generating discomfort could encourage the greater study of GMOs, which can only be beneficial for the public.
Regardless, the extent to which people read and trust labels is debatable. All alcohol bottles and cigarette packs carry a warning from the surgeon general, but few people see this as a reason not to purchase such items. Like an alcohol label, noting that a product is genetically engineered simply informs the consumer of a relevant fact that they are fully capable of ignoring.
GMO labels are already required in more than 40 countries. Shouldn’t America, a country that prides itself on freedom of choice, provide consumers with the same right to knowledge found in other parts of the world?

Nicely dome-Another factor has been seen now that Russia is suspend imports of US corn due to GMO’s, financial repercussions for not acknowledging that the rest of the world will not accept these products.
