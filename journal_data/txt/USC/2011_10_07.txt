USC rode in to Tempe, Ariz., feeling confident after a methodical victory over Syracuse. The Trojans aimed to establish themselves as a force in the Pac-12 South against Arizona State, who many pundits picked to win the division.
“This team is going to stay together,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “They’re going to be strong. We’ve got to get ready for next week. We’re 3-1. The season’s not over. A lot of teams would like to be 3-1. We’ll go back and get ready to play a good Arizona team.”
Positives: USC outgained Arizona State and dominated the time of possession. Despite being down at the half, the Trojans came out fired up and turned in several quality possessions to begin the second half. The turnaround netted them a lead in the third quarter before things went downhill.
Negatives: The Trojans squandered several opportunities to score. In three red zone possessions in the second half, USC only managed six points. Four turnovers and 10 penalties halted several drives and hindered USC from establishing a rhythm. To add fuel to the fire, the Trojans were just 1-of-9 on third-down conversions. Junior tailback Cameron Marshall ran wild and quarterback Brock Osweiler seemed to have a receiver open every time he wanted to throw the ball. Yet again, USC was outscored in the second half and fourth quarter.

Lee DeWyze, winner of the ninth season of American Idol, has reportedly been dropped by RCA Records after releasing only one album, and just a year and a half after winning the show.
DeWyze cruised through his season, never landing in the “Bottom Two,” as he tended to choose songs, such as Hinder’s “Lips of an Angel,” that showed off his rock chops.
The 25-year-old ended up beating dreadlocked favorite Crystal Bowersox in the season finale, but his success on the show didn’t translate to record sales.
The former paint store clerk released his major label debut Live It Up in November 2010 to mixed reviews. It sold only 168,000 copies, making it the worst-selling debut from an “Idol” winner in the show’s history.
RCA Records CEO Peter Edge confirmed the news in an interview with Hollywood Reporter last week, making DeWyze only the second “Idol” winner to be dumped after just one album, after season five’s Taylor Hicks.
DeWyze recently posted on his Twitter page, “I am putting out another album, and there are many things in the works. I am very happy to be making the music I am making, & the direction… I’m going in.”
Five other winners remain on RCA’s roster- season one’s Kelly Clarkson, season four’s Carrie Underwood, season six’s Jordin Sparks, season seven’s David Cook, and season eight’s Kris Allen.

A jury was chosen Oct. 6 in the trial of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the alleged “underwear bomber” of 2009.
Shortly after selecting 12 jurors and four alternates yesterday, one of the initial jurors was dismissed because she was a women native to Abdulmutallab’s home country of Nigeria. The jury consists of nine women — six black and two Asian — and three white men.
Abdulmutallab, a well-educated 24-year-old from a wealthy family, was a passenger on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. Just seven minutes before the jet landed carrying 279 passengers and 11 crew members, he allegedly tried to detonate chemicals hidden in his underwear. Upon seeing flames, passengers and crew subdued Abdulmutallab.
The U.S. government suspects the terrorist group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was behind the attack. Abdulmutallab has pleaded not guilty to eight charges including conspiracy to commit terrorism, use of a weapon of mass destruction and possession of a destructive device in furtherance of an act of violence.
Abdulmutallab is set to represent himself in the case, telling U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds that he wants to give the opening and closing arguments himself. The opening statements in the trial are scheduled to begin this Tuesday.

Beyonce proved she’s hot as ever with her colorful ’60s-inspired video for “Countdown,” the latest single off of her album 4.
“Countdown” is an upbeat song about how she’s dedicated to the man she loves, but the video shows more — the mom-to-be uses her video to prove her pregnancy is not slowing her down.
“It is important that I don’t look at this as like an illness. I am not sick. I am the same woman and I have the same passions,” Beyonce told the Associated Press.
In “Countdown,” Beyonce, still pulling off her Sasha Fierce persona, does not shy away from tight, mod clothing.
From colorful leotards to shear button down shirts to a fitted black turtleneck, Beyonce embraces the way her body is transforming. Her costume choices and the video’s set designs bring to life hints of old classics, such as Flashdance and the iconic Audrey Hepburn.
Beyonce has continued to stay busy with the launch of her new fragrance Pulse and continues to promote her new album. She also told the Associated Press that she will be starting her own record label and wants to create a boy band.
