The No. 1-ranked Trojans look to build on their current 35-game winning streak this weekend as they head east to Pomona and La Verne to play a four-pack of games as part of the Inland Empire Classic.
USC (4-0) will take on UC San Diego in their first game on Saturday (Sept. 14), immediately followed by a matchup with the home team, Pomona-Pitzer.
On Sunday (Sept. 15), the Trojans will face off with Claremont-Mudd-Scripps before taking on Whittier in their final game of the weekend in La Verne.
The five-time defending national champions shouldn’t have much resistance this weekend, as their only opponent that is nationally ranked is No. 11 UC San Diego.
It’s been quite a while since the last time the two teams met, which was in 1998. Head coach Jovan Vavic hadn’t even won his first national championship, and he now has 12. The Trojans proved victorious in their last meeting, as they narrowly defeated the Tritons 12-11 and went on to win the program’s first ever national championship that year.
The Trojans shouldn’t have much trouble with their other three opponents. If one combines their last meetings with Pomona-Pitzer, Claremont and Whittier, USC would have an extremely lop-sided, 63-4 advantage. They most recently defeated Pomona-Pitzer 22-1 last year up in Palo Alto, Calif.
“We are not going to take anyone lightly, and everyone’s going to be after us so we just need to play our game,” senior utility player Mace Rapsey said.
USC started the 2013 season off on the right note, cruising through last weekend’s four opponents at the Triton Invitational. They won both of their first two games by 14 goals, defeating Cal Baptist 19-5 and LMU 21-7. Fifteen different USC players put goals on the board for the Trojans, including the first career goals for redshirt freshman Charlie McBee and true freshmen Nick Bell and Jon Walters. The next day, they would display an even more impressive offensive onslaught, tallying over 50 goals against No. 12 Air Force (23-2) and Redlands (27-4).
Senior driver Nikola Vavic is already on his way to winning the Peter J. Cutino Award after leading the team with 14 goals over the course of the weekend. Walters had a stellar debut in his first weekend of collegiate play with nine goals.
“John Walters stepped up and played really well for us,” Coach Vavic said Monday. “He was really dominant in the two-meters.”
The streaking Trojans have only one mission: win a sixth consecutive national championship. By doing so, they will become the first ever collegiate water polo team to win more than five titles in a row. With that being their overall goal, the team might have something else on their minds now through the beginning of the season: “The Streak.”
Vavic stresses, though, that it is important his team does not forget their true mission.
“We can’t really think about the winning streak,” Coach Vavic said. “When we lose, it’s just going to be another loss. All you can do is play against the next team. But if we can win all of them, that would be even better.”
By the end of this upcoming weekend, USC hopes to have extended their current winning streak to 39 games.

Hi, my name is Luke Holthouse, and I will play Division I lacrosse at USC before I graduate.
Well, probably not. But I learned at my freshman orientation this summer that “ambitious” is one of the five traits of a USC student etched into Tommy Trojan’s statue, and I think Tommy would look much more intimidating if we replaced his bronze sword with a lacrosse stick.
So what makes my goal so ambitious? For starters, USC doesn’t have a Division I men’s lacrosse team. Even if we did, I probably wouldn’t make the team because I’m not very good, but that’s more of a side note.
I do play for the club team, which had a decent season last year, going 4-10 overall in its second year of existence. But our program has relatively little financial support compared to many of the other local clubs. In fact, the guy we hired as the head coach of the team this season resigned after one practice when he realized how hard it is to run a club sports team at USC.
But with some more budget help from the school, the club could become a national powerhouse.
USC made a big splash two years ago when it created a Division I women’s team that stands as a perfect example of how successful lacrosse programs can be established in SoCal.
Once USC brought in Lindsay Munday — one of the top players on the U.S. national team and a former national championship winning coach at Northwestern — as the head coach, the program took off and finished a respectable 8-10 in its first season last year. This year’s incoming recruiting class for the women’s team was ranked as the 10th best in the country by Inside Lacrosse, and I’m betting the team is only a couple of seasons away from competing for a national championship.
I think now would be a fantastic time for us to create one on the men’s side, so I’m calling on all Trojan fans out there that have a spare $10 million or so in their wallet to help me get it started.
Lacrosse is either the oldest or newest sport in the country, depending on which half of it you’re from. The sport was first played by Native Americans centuries ago as a more of a military exercise than extracurricular activity, but has since adapted to one of the most popular sports around the area it was invented.
For decades, the sport was only played in the Northeastern United States in places like Baltimore or Long Island, but the sport is finally sprouting across the Central, Southeastern and Pacific parts of the country.
Inside Lacrosse magazine reported that over 275,000 kids played high school lacrosse in 2011, about a 20,000-kid or 7.8 percent increase from the year before. Last year, Peter Baum of Colgate University and a native of Portland, Ore. became the first player born on the western half of the United States to win the Tewaaraton Trophy, or lacrosse’s equivalent to the Heisman.
The University of Denver, however, is still the only college west of the Mississippi River to field a varsity men’s program despite the increasing number of kids like me that started playing the sport in high school across the West Coast.
USC has a truly unique opportunity to become a pioneer in the sport, as well as athletics in general, by adding a men’s team. There’s no doubt in my mind that lacrosse can become a hotbed sport in California, and enjoy the same popularity as baseball, water polo, soccer, volleyball, softball or really any other sport.
California produced 128 Olympians at London last summer, making up 23 percent of all Americans at the Olympics. Our representation in the total population of the country is only about half of that at 12 percent, yet the year-round sunshine makes it much easier to play outdoor sports 12 months a year and gives West Coast athletes a leg up over athletes in colder climates.
Not only would our program attract the best lacrosse players from San Diego and Orange County – many of whom already play Division I on the East Coast and would love nothing more than a free ride to start a new dynasty in their home state – but I think just as many top players from the East Coast would be interested in the beautiful weather, even more beautiful Song Girls and ever improving academics at USC.
Though professional lacrosse does exist, the league is pretty small and very few lacrosse players make a career out of playing the sport. So the drawbacks of playing at a less established program are much smaller than they would be in a sport like football.
Athletic facilities shouldn’t be a problem with the new McKay Center, though the school would have to make an investment into a reputable head coach and staff.
Though there are about five other women’s lacrosse teams in California for USC to compete against, the men’s program would have to fly across the country about half the season and travel would be a larger expense.
But the whole point of going Division I is so that we can be innovators in the sport and start the growth of college teams in the state.
The biggest challenge to overcome for the potential team would be Title IX, as the school would probably have to add another varsity women’s program to maintain equal funding rates.
The big women’s sport that isn’t Division I at USC that comes to mind is softball, but that would be a highly expensive project. The school would have to build a separate softball facility on campus rather than use pre-existing McAlister Field like the men’s lacrosse team probably would, hence my estimation of an 8-digit project. Someone from the urban planning department at the Price school would also have to figure out where to put that, but I think we’ll be able to figure that out.
As President C. L. Max Nikias wrote in his welcome letter to students this year, “USC athletics is the glue that binds the Trojan Family.” Our proud sports program attracts students across the nation that want to be a part of the great fan experiences at USC. The pride created by the nearly hundred national championships USC teams have won is what makes our alumni network so strong and helps grow the school’s endowment to the point where it can fund all sorts of other projects.
So I urge the USC athletic department to join me and the rest of the club lacrosse team at USC as we try to raise money for a potential Division I team that can contribute to the stellar athletics reputation that the Trojan name already carries.

Thanks Title IX
Good article.
One minor correction: The University of Denver is not the only D-I program west of the Mississippi. The US Air Force Academy also has D-I lacrosse.

After taking its first loss of the season on a tough out-of-state road trip, the USC women’s soccer team is back in action for two home matchups this weekend.
Crossed up · Senior midfielder Autumn Altamirano has two assists for the Women of Troy this season after starting all 18 games last year. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
 
On Friday, the Women of Troy will welcome the Pepperdine Waves to McAlister Field for a 2:30 p.m. game. The squad will then host Loyola Marymount at 1 p.m. on Sunday.
No. 23 USC (3-1-1) fought two hard battles in the Minnesota heat last week, but failed to come out with a victory. A 1-1 tie against Ole Miss and 1-0 loss to LSU, on the heels of a strong 3-0 start, have given the Women of Troy extra motivation going into their next two games.
Sophomore midfielder Megan Borman knows the team learned a lot during their road trip.
“We got a red card, so we had to substitute and learn to defend with ten people. That was the biggest thing,” Borman said. “So even though we didn’t get the wins we wanted, it was still a positive weekend.”
Like USC, Pepperdine began its 2013 campaign on a high note before slowing down. The Waves started the season 2-0-1, but suffered two tough losses last weekend to No. 11 Michigan and Tulane.
Goalkeeper Hannah Saebert leads a strong backline for Pepperdine that has only allowed seven goals in five games. It will take a bounce back effort from USC’s dynamic attack to break through the Waves’ defense. After scoring four times in each of their first three games, the Women of Troy combined for just one goal against Ole Miss and LSU.
Coach Ali Khosroshahin attributed this to a lack of patience on offense.
“Too many times we times we would get into a situation and options wouldn’t develop, so we would just dump it in [and] lead to another turnover,” Khosroshahin said. “This weekend we need to keep the ball until we can create better looks at goal, higher percentage opportunities.”
Borman echoed her coach’s thoughts. “We have to work on finishing our chances,” she said. “We have so many girls who are almost 6- feet tall, we call them the trees. We have been working on timing our runs and getting our crosses in the right spots.”
Loyola Marymount (3-3) also enters its matchup with USC on a two-game losing streak, having fallen to No. 4 Stanford and Long Beach State last week. The Lions mirror the Women of Troy in their offensive balance; four LMU players have scored at least one goal this season.
The Women of Troy have three forwards — senior Elizabeth Eddy and freshmen Kayla Mills and Tanya Samarzich — with at least three goals.
USC junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley will have her hands full with the Lions’ balanced attack, but should be up to the task. Stanley and the Trojans’ defense have allowed more than one goal only once this year.
This weekend marks the first time the team can be seen on television this season, a good opportunity for the team to gain some exposure on a national level. The Pac-12 network will televise Friday’s game live, and Sunday’s contest can be followed live on the Pac-12 website.
The Women of Troy fell from 17th to 23rd in the NCAA rankings after their road trip, and a televised win could help the squad climb the rankings once again. But Khosroshahin is just excited to be back home.
“We love LA. We love Southern California,” the 7th year coach said. “It will be nice to be here at McAlister and in front of the Trojan Family.”
Borman agreed. “Traveling is tough,” she said. “Playing at home certainly has its advantages.”

The last time USC faced off against Boston College, Pete Carroll was still the head coach, Matt Barkley was just beginning his tenure as starting quarterback, and it seemed as though the Trojans were set to continue one of the most consistently dominant runs in college football for at least a couple more years.
Times have certainly changed since the 2009 Emerald Bowl (which USC won, 24-13).
As the Trojans (1-1) prepare to take on Boston College (2-0) this Saturday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, there is an undeniable pessimistic air surrounding the fan base after last week’s jarring 10-7 defeat at the hands of Washington State. USC is determined to prove that the upset was just that — a bump in the road as opposed to the beginning of a long, downward spiral in the Trojans’ 2013 campaign.
“One thing I can say is that you won’t see that side of the Trojans again,” redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler said after the loss. “You won’t see us playing like that on offense. You won’t see that negative energy. That’s just not who we are.”
Any sort of success from the Trojans’ passing attack would be measured as an improvement on last week’s performance. Kessler threw for just 41 yards while completing 8 of 13 passes, most of which were thrown to receivers behind the line of scrimmage, as no USC pass play gained more than eight yards.
USC head coach Lane Kiffin is expected to delve deeper into his offensive playbook after finally picking a full-time starting quarterback in Kessler.
It might take some time for Kessler to adjust to throwing intermediate and deep balls after being reined in by Kiffin’s conservative playcalling in the Trojans’ first two games.
But Kessler did show promise in USC’s final scrimmage on Aug. 21 when he was tested on passes downfield. While mostly facing the Trojans’ first-team defense, Kessler was 13-for-22 for 218 yards and a pair of long touchdown passes of 31 and 55 yards to sophomore receiver Nelson Agholor, while also throwing two interceptions on tipped balls.
Kessler also might benefit from knowing he’s no longer competing with fellow redshirt sophomore Max Wittek.
“I’m not trying to make excuses, but those first two weeks [against Hawai’i and Washington State]… I would be lying if I said it wasn’t affecting me,” Kessler said after practice on Tuesday. “It’s tough to focus on winning the game when you’re worrying about other things. [Being named the starter] instills a confidence I didn’t have in the first two weeks.”
The Trojans’ offensive line will be protecting Kessler from a pass rush that was simply atrocious last year, as they Eagles only mustered six sacks the entire season. But the Eagles have made progress under new defensive coordinator Don Brown’s aggressive 4-3 scheme, racking up seven sacks and seven turnovers in wins over Villanova and Wake Forest.
Cornerback Bryce Jones, the only new starter in the Eagles’ secondary, is the reigning ACC Defensive Back of the Week after picking off a pass, his second of the season, and recovering a fumble against Wake Forest in a 24-10 triumph last week.
Boston College has already matched its total wins from a year ago, when the Eagles stumbled to a 2-10 record, leading to the hiring of new head coach Steve Addazio.
Addazio has established an offense that has relied heavily on senior running back Andre Williams, a 230 lbs. power back who ranks third in the nation with 318 rushing yards (5.5 yards per carry).
“It’s a Stanford type of offense,” Kiffin said. “They’re heavy on the run and try to open it up with the play action.”
Williams presents the toughest challenge yet for USC’s run defense, which has been the best in the country thus far, allowing just 15 yards per game and 0.6 yards per carry.
Boston College has recently gone through a remarkable amount of scheme changes on offense, as the team is on its fifth offensive coordinator in a little more than two calendar years.
Senior quarterback Chase Rettig, a SoCal native, has been the constant amid all the change. Rettig has been the team’s starter since the fourth game of his true freshman season, and has averaged more than 3,100 yards over the past two seasons.
The Trojans’ relentless pass rush, which leads the nation in sacks (11), could cause major headaches for Rettig behind an offensive line that allowed 35 sacks last season.
But the Trojans aren’t taking anything for granted, especially after last week.
“We don’t go over thinking we’re gonna walk over a team,” redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey said. “We have to grind out every game and finish.”
Senior Alex Amidon was Rettig’s favorite target last year, setting Boston College’s single-season records for receptions (78) and receiving yards (1,215) en route to being named an All-ACC first team pick.
Kiffin expects USC’s own star receiver, junior Marqise Lee, to bounce back after picking up just 27 yards on seven catches against Washington State.
“Marqise has been pushing himself, trying a little too hard,” Kiffin said. “We expect him to play really consistently, so I had a conversation with him Sunday [about] just going back to doing his job.”
Kiffin also said that he expects freshman tailback Justin Davis to have an impact against the Eagles after Davis received just two carries last week, but didn’t guarantee anything. Redshirt sophomore Tre Madden took the bulk of the workload (32 carries, 151 yards), and many were concerned that Madden was overworked after he admitted feeling “banged up” after the defeat.
“I would definitely expect to see Justin Davis … It all depends on how the game is going,” Kiffin said. “[Last week] we were doing the best thing we could do to win. I’ve got to do the best thing to win the game and not worry about what stats are like.”
Kickoff is at 12 p.m. in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, and the game will air on the Pac-12 Network.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Tuesday, Sept. 10 and Thursday, Sept. 12.
Crimes against a person
At 2:17 p.m. on Sept. 10, a staff member reported his ex-wife violated a restraining order when she showed up at his office. The staff member did not report the incident to DPS at the time, but filed a report with his local police station.

If you’ve ever been short on time and needed a quick fix to satiate your appetite, you’ve probably found yourself at Seeds Marketplace, the gourmet store on campus that provides students with everything from freshly prepared salads to red velvet cupcakes.
Though Seeds does well by selling its salads and sandwiches, they also have a section for market goods, where everyday pantry items are sold at a significant mark-up.
Compared with local markets and convenience stores, Seeds is the most expensive place to buy groceries in the USC area. Seeds marked up their prices up by as much as 80 percent compared to nearby Fresh & Easy, Ralphs and CVS.
For $2.69, one can buy a 4 oz. box of saltines at Seeds. $2.99 at Fresh and Easy purchases more than three times that amount of crackers, and four times that amount at Ralphs.
When asked about how prices at Seeds are determined, Kris Klinger, director of USC hospitality, said that the department has little control over each item’s price.
“We charge what we basically pay for the product, plus mark-up to pay for the labor to be able to provide these products,” Klinger said.
What makes Seeds so different from markets such as Ralphs and Fresh & Easy is its small size, Klinger said. Because Seeds does not buy products in bulk as these larger chains do, it costs more to purchase the products being put on the shelves.
“Seeds is a small marketplace, and if you go to other small marketplaces, the prices are going to be more expensive than Ralphs [as well],” Klinger said.
Students tend to have mixed views about Seeds, regardless of its prices being on the higher side.
“Seeds is a lot more convenient for students who live on campus and for in between classes and that’s why people pay for it,” said Emily Vu, a sophomore majoring in global health.
Klinger defended the marketplace at Seeds, saying that USC Hospitality tries its best to meet the needs of everyone on campus.
“We’d sort of miss out on what our reason is for being on campus, to serve the students, staff and faculty,” Klinger said.
Many students refuse to pay these high costs, and prefer instead to visit larger markets with lower prices and wider selections.
Logan Childers, a sophomore majoring in international relations and East Asian languages and culture, said that he does not shop at Seeds because it is “too expensive” and there is “not a lot of variety.” For him, “other grocery stores are still more convenient.”
Compared to CVS and Fresh & Easy, the price of Lucky Charms at Seeds is marked up anywhere from 66 to 75 percent; at Ralphs, customers can even get a special deal on Lucky Charms if they buy five boxes, lowering the price from $4.59 to $1.50 per box. Not only is the cereal cheaper at these markets, but also better deals are also available when products are bought in larger quantities.
“I normally go to Seeds twice a week because I like their salads, [but] I don’t really shop here,” said Jeffrey Zhang, a sophomore majoring in business administration and international relations and Spanish.
This appears to be the trend with students: Most will visit Seeds a few times a week for meals, but almost no one will buy its market goods.
Though Klinger admitted  the market is not the section of Seeds that earns the most, it is the convenience “for the folks that do need [it],” which Klinger believes makes it a necessary part of campus.

Since its groundbreaking on Nov. 8, 2012, Wallis Annenberg Hall has reached 50 percent completion and will be finished in June 2014. The ground-level media facility will be used for student programs starting in July, and the building will be completely open for the start of classes in August 2014.
Slow and steady · Construction of the highly anticipated Wallis Annenberg Hall started in October 2012. The building is projected to reach completion in June 2014, and will hold classes beginning in the fall of 2014. – Alana Victor | Daily Trojan
According to Charles Peyton, the director of operations for Annenberg Facilities and Technology and the lead project manager for the School and Chair of Annenberg’s Building Committee, this building project sets the standard for future construction at USC.
“From now on, all new buildings [at USC] are Collegiate Gothic and will be modeled after this,” Peyton said.
The architectural firm managing the project, Harley Ellis Devereaux, has also signed on to help with the redesign of the University Village.
“The UV project will also be Collegiate Gothic,” Peyton said. “So we are kind of the first and the benchmark of all future USC architecture, which is a really cool kind of blending of the past and providing something for part of the future.”
The new building will also juxtapose the old exterior architecture with the modern cutting-edge, technology-focused interior.
“It will be very Annenberg, very modern, very high tech, very different,” Peyton said.
In planning for the design, the school worked with design consultants Strategy Plus to conduct a space assessment survey given to students, faculty, alumni and the university community to discover what they did and did not like about the old Annenberg building to take into consideration for the new building.
“When we did that space assessment, we expected the Annenberg building to just get ripped on by students and faculty, but they loved it,” Peyton said. “I expected some criticism, but it really did well.”
Though Strategy Plus received positive responses from students for the current Annenberg building, many are looking forward to the new facilities.
“I think that the [current] facilities are pretty good, but, considering what I have seen in some of my internships, there are some things that could stand to be updated,” said Steven Covelman, a senior majoring in print and digital journalism. “I think we could really use some new computers, some new software just to make it so it simulates the newsroom environment a little bit better. I wish the rooms were designed to look more like a newsroom, so it’s not a huge shock when you get into that environment.”
All the feedback, both positive and negative, was distilled and taken into consideration for the building’s program.
“It was really a building built in the Annenberg tradition, which is a very collaborative and involved community,” Peyton said. “Each space was kind of designed by a different subset, whether it was the students or the faculty.”
One of the aspects of the original Annenberg building that got the most positive feedback was the East Lobby.
This feedback in particular became one of the main focuses in building the Wallis Annenberg Hall. Upon entering the building there is a continuous atrium throughout all five floors of the building — one floor below and four above — serving as a central forum.
“This space was modeled after the existing Annenberg East Lobby, the Arco Forum at the Kennedy School at Harvard and Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre,” Peyton said. “It’s going to be similar to the East Lobby with tables, chairs and a place for students to come hang out, be seen, study, kind of a watering hole.”
Unlike the East Lobby, however, there will be a three-story media wall driven by LED technology that will act as a backdrop for the central space.
“The thought is that this is a place to congregate at and hang out with other students before class, but then we wanted to transform it to a huge open event space,” Peyton said.
The room will be able to convert into a community forum with the incorporation of a portable stage, the media wall and seating that can be brought in all on the entry level, as well as overflow on the second and third floors looking down onto the event space.
“It was really a guiding principle of the school to make spaces as collaborative, transparent and open as possible,” Peyton said. “Dean Wilson really wanted this ‘agora’ or this village green idea where it was the hub of where everything happened.”
Another way the building will emphasize the collaborative community feel is by showcasing as much student work as possible. Anywhere the builders could put glass instead of drywall, they did.
Additionally, glass will divide some of the classrooms and individual workspaces, as well as the newsroom. Students in classrooms will be visible, so that everyone can share a hardworking environment.
The building will feature a traditional converged multimedia newsroom, broadcasting facility and radio set and a future-oriented 360-degree assignment desk for Annenberg Television News, Annenberg Radio News and Neon Tommy.
The opportunities for collaboration come together with the incorporation of a core media storing and sharing system.
“The entire building is anchored with one huge media storage system and a really robust media asset management and distribution system, which really means all students’ projects and formal multimedia work goes into a big bucket and that bucket is available for every student and faculty member to share, use, distribute as they want,” Peyton said.
In addition to USCnet, the building will have its own media network. There will be more than 111 different access points in the building, in addition to a distributed antenna system which will provide “flawless” 4G access when the WiFi goes down.
Freshman, sophomore and junior students are looking forward to the opportunities the new building will bring.
“I am really excited for the advancements in technology,” said Caroline Deisley, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism. “They are going to be so helpful for ATVN. The current technology we use is outdated, so the new space will allow us to interact with up-to-date and current programs and devices.”

Collegiate Gothic, really?
 Last word from Sample and then Nikias was that all buildings would be in the Northern Italian Rennaissance style: Bovard, Mudd, Wilson Student Union, Zumberge, etc..
In the meantime, the new Student Health Center, the McKay Ctr,  and Tutor Hall are all in this Italian style. 
WHY WOULD WE CHANGE TO GOTHIC AT THIS POINT?
Somebody needs to take charge of this school–ridiculous lack of cohesion and communication. At the end of the day with all the construction going on, the campus is going to look like a big pile.
I don’t know that the campus is actually switching to Gothic — I think this guy is slightly misguided. In looking at all the current renderings for Annenberg and preliminary renderings of the UV, it still follows the Italian Renaissance style, with small touches of Gothic in some places. I think that’s more the new style — a blend of Italian and Gothic — than Gothic itself. That blend works well with the fabric of all of the historic buildings on Trousdale. (Think arches and tile roof, but still blending limestone and red brick)

A war is mounting in the streets of Los Angeles — a war involving cars with pink mustaches.
Those pink mustaches belong to drivers working for Lyft, one of many companies looking to corner the quickly growing ridesharing market in cities such as Los Angeles.
The long-held image of cabbies — in all the glory of their rusty yellow steeds and torn faux-leather interiors, hefty fares and questionable grasps on traffic laws — might soon face competition from this new breed of drivers.
The goal of ridesharing is to optimize transportation efficiency by tapping into a vital resource: empty seats. By connecting drivers with open seats with those who need rides, ridesharing hopes to provide rides more quickly, cheaply and efficiently, all while eliminating traffic through carpooling.
Over the summer, L.A. taxi drivers protested ridesharing apps such as Lyft, Uber and Sidecar and sent the companies cease-and-desist orders. Mayor Eric Garcetti, however, came out in support of the innovative apps in August, and simultaneously pledged to assist taxi companies in modernizing their businesses.
Though court battles over the apps continue to rage in other cities, for now it appears that the apps are not only safe in the cities they currently operate in, but are also expanding. Apps like Zimride and Ridejoy, as well as L.A. staples Lyft and Uber, are expanding quickly in prime markets throughout the country.
USC industrial engineering Professor Maged Dessouky, who has researched transportation optimization for more than 17 years, said that the ridesharing industry will likely see a marked increase in popularity over the next few years.
This can be traced to rising gas prices and the increasing frequency of freeway tolls, which Dessouky believes will soon force societies to figure out ways to maximize road efficiency.
“The price saturation point in terms of gas and tolls, along with the time savings of ridesharing, will make it an alternative,” Dessouky said.
Within the ridesharing system, drivers set certain hours when they will pick up anyone who calls them on the app, while a network in the service allows users to rate their experiences.
According to CNN, ridesharing’s largest demographic is between the ages of 18 and 35. This isn’t immediately apparent at USC, though.
Out of 10 students randomly interviewed by the Daily Trojan, four had heard of ridesharing before, with three saying that they had heard positive reviews.
The bigger issue for newer ridesharing companies is that none of the surveyed students had actually used the services.
They cited various reasons, but the consensus seemed to be that while it’s a nice idea, most students had little use for it.
“I would rather take the Metro,” said Elvy Fuentes, a junior majoring in human biology. “A car is a really close space to be with a stranger.”
But Dessouky believes that if they gave the services a chance, potential users would return.
“What we’ve found is that when passengers try it once, they’re hooked,” he said.
In general, safety concerns seemed to be minimal among students. In fact, many students pointed out that ridesharing could function as a safer alternative to public transit at night.
Others said that it could potentially be more convenient than other forms of transportation due to its use of smartphone technology.
Ridesharing’s lower price point also proved to be the largest pull for many students. Eight of the 10 students surveyed said they would consider using a ridesharing service as an alternative to a cab, and every one of them cited price as one of the principle factors in their decision.
“On a student budget, I’d like to know how much I was about to spend,” said Sivi Ananthasingam, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences. “I think it’s growing. A lot of students are looking for cheaper ways to get around, and a lot of people don’t really have cars here.”
Dessouky believes that the college demographic has strong potential for interest in the car-sharing market.
“Students are the ultimate market for this,” he said. “Students don’t have cars, but they have smartphones and they aren’t afraid of technology.”
Lyft is not rideshare but rather is commercial for-hire transportation of passengers.  It is a disservice to genuine rideshare when companies like Lyft appropriate the label of “rideshare” for commercial enterprises.
Real rideshare is not-for-profit and typically involves cost-sharing among people who are going the same way.  Neither regulators nor taxi operators have any problem with real rideshare, which is protected by law as a genuine part of the solution to pollution and traffic congestion.
Lyft however puts more cars on the streets, not fewer.  Fake rideshare undermines the jobs of full-time breadwinners who drive taxicabs, and replaces them with casual labor.
Trojan readers ought to ask in advance to see a commercial proof of insurance certificate before hopping into a cute Lyft car.

Jason Collins has thrown the first pitch at Fenway. He’s introduced the first lady. And he’s talked on the phone with President Obama and Oprah — on the same day.
Proud · Jason Collins is the first male athlete in the National Basketball Association to have publicly come out as gay. – Daniel Rothberg | Daily Trojan
But on Thursday, Collins, who came out as the first openly gay male athlete in a major professional sport, shared stories from the 33 years leading up to his announcement, and his life since, during a conversation at the Keck School of Medicine.
The event, which was part of the Dean’s Distinguished Lecturer Series, focused on Collins’ experience coming out, the reaction that followed and his new place as a role model within the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. For over an hour, Collins spoke in a conversation with Carmen A. Puliafito, dean of the Keck School.
Until this year, Collins, an NBA player for 12 years, said he had never revealed his sexuality to another person.
“For 33 years, I never told another soul,” Collins said. “I had a lot of great conversations with my German Shepherd, Shadow, sitting around watching TV.”
During the conversation, Collins spoke about what it was like being gay in the culture of athletics.
“People will just associate the worst stereotypes with being gay,” Collins said. “And, yeah, I heard a lot of conversations in the locker room.”
Collins said he took that as reason to play more intensely.
“It made me play that much harder, so if and when the day came that I did have the courage to speak up, it would challenge all of those teammates as far as what it means to be gay.”
Collins was a fitting speaker, Puliafito said, because discrimination can be an obstacle in the workplace.
“It’s great to have an opportunity to talk to someone like Jason Collins who’s really a role model for people dealing with who they are and being honest with who they are without fear of disrespect,” Puliafito said.
Collins first came out in an email to a trainer who he saw in an “It Gets Better” video. He sent the email the Saturday after Thanksgiving, during the 2011 NBA lockout.
“It was the first time where basketball really wasn’t part of my life,” Collins said. “I’m training, but I’m thinking, ‘Am I going to go through the rest of my life like this?’”
About an hour after he clicked send on the email, Collins said he found out that the lockout had been lifted.
“I was like ‘Oh, dear God, what have I done?’” he said as members of the audience laughed.
Collins likened coming out to taking off a mask, a phrase he first heard Oprah use. Collins said he no longer had to lie about girlfriends or censor what he said for fear of it sounding stereotypically gay.
“I don’t have to go through that any more and mentally, I think I will be even better as a player.”
Collins said when he came out publically in Sports Illustrated last April he wasn’t sure, as a black player, what type of response to expect from the black community.
“As far as support from the African American community, traditionally, it has been harder to accept being gay,” Collins said. “But I think slowly, as more of us step forward and take it from being some abstract thing … then people identify with, ‘We know them, we have some familiarity.’”
Vincent Vigil, the director of USC’s LGBT Resource Center, said that Collins serves as an important role model, both as an athlete and as a minority. During the event’s question and answer portion, Vigil said that when he met with incoming athletes, he asked them if they knew who Collins was.
“Every incoming athlete at USC raised their hand [to signify they know] who Jason Collins is,” Vigil told the audience. “You are truly making a difference and an impact in the lives of our youth but also changing the culture for the LGBT community.”
In an interview with the Daily Trojan after the event, Collins emphasized the importance of coming out to a trusted person rather than hiding one’s sexuality as he did for 33 years.
“I had the toughest time verbalizing it, just saying the words, ‘I’m gay,’” Collins said. “You have to tell someone so you have an ability to really be your true self with someone. And you’ll be shocked that your true self is actually pretty similar to [your] persona, [it’s] just that you don’t have to pretend to have a girlfriend or make up some story.”

Vince Gilligan, the creator of Breaking Bad, came to visit USC on Tuesday for the “Writing Presents…” series. Amid amusing anecdotes about actor Aaron Paul (who plays Jesse Pinkman on the show) and pink teddy bears (it’s a long story), he made a point to discuss the change in the movie industry. Gilligan argued what many in the business have started to echo — that television, in some ways, has gotten close to the old studio system of the so-called Golden Age of Hollywood. That system, in a very simplified form, consisted of vertical integration (allowing studios to control many aspects of distribution) and securing creative talent under long-term contracts. This system guaranteed the distribution and screening of several movies a year, with writers churning scripts out constantly.
Gilligan pointed out that some of these traits have been adopted, and taken advantage of, by television. A certain television channel’s ability to screen everything it makes gives it the sort of control over distribution that the studios used to enjoy. A long-running television show can take advantage of a room of writers churning out material.
The film studios have long since abandoned that studio system, in no small part because of a 1948 Supreme Court ruling that outlawed block booking. (Booking is a business model where studios would force theaters to buy and agree to screen movies in bulk, in advance.) That was the primary tool the studios used to control distribution and assure themselves large profits. Studios that were no longer able to rely on the distribution of a certain number of films per year had to gradually turn their focus toward fewer big-earning blockbusters, or as Gilligan put it, “tent-pole pictures,” rather than several smaller-earning films. For example, 20th Century Fox and Universal put out an average of more than 33 movies a year in the ’40s and ’50s. That average is now 18 in the last 10 years. In essence, studios go for money-earning quality over quantity.
For television, though, the old system works. The ability to stick with a show through TV’s form of vertical integration has allowed the greatness of Breaking Bad to flourish over time, as well as the initially struggling Game of Thrones to gain traction. For film, where it is no longer viable, this necessity to make as much as possible from individual films, accelerated by an audience that’s now distracted by several other forms of media, has amplified many of the ails of the blockbuster.
Because of this need to appeal to a wider audience, major blockbusters have increasingly had to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Simply put, this meant making the plots simpler in favor of more excitement through action or effects.
Naturally, this effect has drawbacks. It’ll be very difficult to see an action-packed yet intelligently-crafted summer film like one of the old Hitchcock classics again. A movie such as North by Northwest is an absolute barn-burner when it comes to action and twists, starring a megastar in Cary Grant, but at the same time it has an art to it that today’s blockbusters lack. Studios can’t risk releasing films like that, with so much financially at stake on each one — which would at least partially explain the increase of visually arresting films that lack a strong plot.
How many times have you heard complaints about beautiful movies with a bad story? For example, “Pacific Rim looks awesome, but the story was kind of stupid.” Sure, Pacific Rim was lacking in plot.It’s not a very difficult observation to make. In fact, I would argue that director Guillermo del Toro barely cared about the plot based on its comically rushed, densely packed introduction sequence. He practically brushes over 12 years worth of world-changing events in a few minutes, because for what he wanted to do with the movie, those events really weren’t important. The story wasn’t important. It was a canvas for del Toro, a fantastic director, to show us giant robots and giant aliens fighting each other in glorious 3-D. Sure, the plot consisted of a series of events to fill in the spaces between the battles. Sure, the characters were all about as flat as the ticket stub used to get in to see them. The images on that screen, however, had quintessential Hollywood magic, supercharged for the modern age.
Television, with all its character development and all its human drama, would never be able to show us something as visually striking as what is being shown on the silver screen. With immense budgets now funneled into special effects and production to compensate for the added risk each movie entails, film now has more capability than ever to bring fantastic things to life. It’s a trade-off. The same realities that drove the studios to constrain themselves and simplify their stories are also driving them to bring amazing worlds to life. What has more broad appeal than stunning images? In the hands of amazing directors like del Toro, we can see just how visually pleasing those images can be, while simultaneously satisfying the studios’ thirst for profit. Art and talent are not squeezed out of the best blockbusters, they are simply rechanneled.

It’s hard to fathom, but it’s been seven years since Arctic Monkeys thundered onto the scene with Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not, one of the fastest-selling debut albums in UK chart history. In their earlier days, Arctic Monkeys were anything but “fluorescent adolescents.” The post-punk pioneers once sported stringy mop haircuts concealed by hoodies. But with the flick of his sharp-witted tongue and blunt words, frontman Alex Turner accumulated three years’ worth of hype prior to the release of their first LP, and the Monkeys’ snarky garage-rock sound catapulted them into the spotlight.

Turner has traded Sheffield for Los Angeles since then; that hoodie for a leather jacket; that unmanageable hair for a slick, stylized Elvis curl and his shrug for swagger. The result doesn’t inflate the band’s latest effort with bravado or amateur glam rock (though the album’s heavy hip-hop influences might have something to do with the latter). Rather, AM is the howl of someone mysterious — someone perhaps lurking uncomfortably in the back corner of the bar — and just as lonely.
Arctic Monkeys were once among the last heralds of Brit-rock (circa 2006), but Turner name-dropped distinct influences for the band’s fifth LP: guitar licks a la Black Sabbath, the hip-hop beats of Dr. Dre and Outkast and R&B from Aaliyah. Arctic Monkeys collaborated with Queens of the Stone Age on their fourth effort, Suck It and See, and adopted psychedelic vibes from its leader, Josh Homme. Homme returns for a couple of guest spots on AM, and his influence is ever-present. The youthful Brits of yesteryear are now California-transplants, and their new sound is dirty, dingy rock with a simper — guitar-loaded with bass beats that still pack a pop punch.
AM is most obviously an abbreviation of the band’s name, but it doubles as an ode to a precarious late-night lifestyle that, without warning, slowly oozes into morning (or, as Turner croons on the penultimate track “Knee Socks,” “when the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock,”). His lyrics sting with desperation and vulnerability, and evoke the all too familiar feelings of stumbling, clumsy, intoxicated longing and the need for romantic validation.
The one-two combo at the top of the album’s queue (“Do I Wanna Know?” and “R U Mine?”) were both pre-released singles that together combine for a deadly and alluring introduction, but also prelude “AM” with a succinct synopsis.
Against the slink of a grungy guitar, Turner pines almost pathetically for his potential lover, pleading, “We could be together / If you wanted to.” But even his bleakest efforts to solicit her response — “Ever thought of calling when you’ve had a few? / ‘Cause I always do” — are more melancholy than pitiful, and unnervingly familiar. The line also introduces the underlying vein of drugs and alcohol that both remedy and ruin Turner’s unrequited search for companionship throughout the album. The band even released a music video to accompany the track “Why’d You Only Call Me When You’re High” that features an inebriated Turner wandering the streets and hallucinating graphic sexual encounters with his fellow wanderers.
The album’s standout hit “R U Mine?” might be the best since 2006’s “I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor,” though the two tracks sound like distant cousins, if at all related. Turner awakens from the crawling drawl he favors on the darker parts of the album, and the drums kick up and gel against an infectious guitar riff.
This track’s companion is the electric “Arabella,” a cosmic love song that pays tribute to classic rock, complete with the kind of thumping guitar you’d strum along to on Guitar Hero after a signature wail: “Arabella!”
AM is often punctuated by falsettos that would seem to counter the band’s stab at trip-hop in theory, but rather supplement its soaring rock sounds with layered vocals. And perhaps as a caricature of Turner’s ‘50s look, there are tracks ridden with “shoo-wop”s and “ooh la la”s. These songs become easy sing-alongs and toe-tappers, but sacrifice both content and grit for poppiness.
It turns out Turner’s slick smugness is a façade. A quarter of AM is raw and honest balladry. Traditional Arctic Monkeys ballads paint tableaus of bars and clubs and the social etiquette of dim, greasy Britain. They allude to young boys running from “coppers” out of sheer boredom and entertainment, and drunken lads squabbling over who was first in line. The twinkling ballads on AM, however, are of a different breed.
“No. 1 Party Anthem,” a true contender for the album’s best track, paints a grimy club scene where sweat sticks to the walls (possibly in Los Angeles, because Turner notes, “Sunglasses indoors / par for the course”). His youthful nervousness about picking up girls on previous albums returns, but this time with sadness, not anxiety. In his “drunken monologues,” Turner sulkily slurs: “It’s not like I’m falling in love / I just want you to do me no good / And you look like you could.”
Turner trudges on with the ultimate track, “I Wanna Be Yours,” a somber, twinkling tune that pits him at his most sincere and desperate, begging to be loved at any cost. “I wanna be your vacuum cleaner / Breathing in your dust,” Turner lulls and ends the verse by surrendering everything: “You call the shots, babe / I just wanna be yours.” The swagger, the drunken glamour of the leather jacket-adorned rock star is an illusion, and Turner concludes the album like he’s slogging through the mud in his heeled boots.
AM is a different sound for the Californian Arctic Monkeys, one dripping with unease and determined temerity. It’s not quite the best we’ve ever seen from the group — but it’s close.
Great review – the Californian Arctic Monkeys!  Classic.

Irish playwright and literary critic George Bernard Shaw once famously said, “If you cannot get rid of the family skeleton, you may as well make it dance.” Billy Bob Thornton appears to have taken this advice to heart for his new film Jayne Mansfield’s Car, an exploration of family, faith and fatherhood inspired in part by the actor’s own life experiences.

Warmly observed — but largely dependent on a glut of cheap laughs and a third-act nosedive into gooey-hearted sentiment — Thornton’s country-fried melodrama attempts to blend the wounded vitality of a Tennessee Williams play with the fraught family dynamics of Tracy Letts’ similarly themed August: Osage County. The result is a disjointed, overlong jumble buoyed by a dutiful late-career performance from Robert Duvall.
The film, Thornton’s first time in the director’s chair since 2001’s Daddy and Them, revolves around the Caldwell Plantation in 1969 Alabama, home to a wealthy clan of idle eccentrics dominated by God-fearing, Yankee-loathing patriarch Jim (Duvall) and his three grown sons. The old man also has a daughter, Vicky (Shawnee Smith), who escaped just long enough to fall in love with a misogynistic lunkhead named Neal (comedian Ron White, sans his usual cigar and tumbler of scotch whisky).
Jim’s oldest son, Jimbo (Robert Patrick), envies his brothers Carroll (Kevin Bacon, vaguely channeling Eric Stoltz’s character in Pulp Fiction) and Skip (Thornton) for becoming decorated World War II heroes while he languished in basic training. Carroll, disillusioned by his own time in the service, spends his days smoking pot and organizing local peace rallies, much to his father’s consternation, while Skip, the quiet dreamer who suffered horrible burns while flying for the Navy, staves off shellshock by maintaining his impressive fleet of sports cars.
The Caldwells continue in this state of dysfunctional detachment until the news breaks that Jim’s estranged ex-wife has died in England and her “other” family is bringing her remains back to Alabama for burial. After the funeral, Jim reluctantly opens his home to the strangers, led by Kingsley (John Hurt), the recent widower, and his two adult children: burly, brooding Philip (Ray Stevenson) and free-spirited Camilla (Frances O’Connor from The Hunter), the latter of whom immediately develops feelings for Skip. The resulting long weekend leads to a torrent of confessions, revelations and nude poetry readings that would make the gang from The Big Chill think twice about the dangers of oversharing.
Even though they initially come across as little more than fussy British stereotypes, Kingsley’s brood supplies the film with a much-needed injection of variety and pep, especially during the otherwise listless finale. Hurt makes Kingsley’s awkward efforts to bond with Jim oddly moving, with the exception of a poorly-timed sight gag involving the ingestion of LSD on a hunting trip, while Stevenson, a gifted actor too often relegated to meathead roles in action clunkers such as Punisher: War Zone and G.I. Joe: Retaliation, delivers his finest performance since Kill the Irishman as Phillip, whose devoted demeanor masks reservoirs of barely-contained resentment for the father who trivializes his accomplishments at every turn.
The principal pleasure of Jayne Mansfield’s Car comes from watching a performer of Duvall’s caliber scratch at the seams of Jim’s crotchety, weather-beaten soul, making him the most fully realized character in Thornton and Tom Epperson’s wildly uneven script. And even though the eponymous automobile makes a cameo appearance somewhere around the halfway mark, the movie’s title has less to do with the demise of the 1950s blonde bombshell than the old man’s morbid fascination with car crashes, an obsession purportedly taken from Thornton’s own father, who would routinely drag his children to the sites of grisly accidents and force them to stare at the twisted wreckage for hours on end.
Though Jayne Mansfield’s Car is a solid showcase for the acting talent involved, nothing here comes even close to approaching the artistic heights of Thornton’s previous work, particularly the screenplay he co-wrote with Epperson for the underrated drug thriller One False Move and, of course, his oft-imitated, still mesmerizing performance in Sling Blade. Compared to that level of pure, unfettered creativity, this Car is running on fumes.

In August, tech giant Google stated that its users have no “reasonable expectation” of privacy. These statements were made in documents filed in response to a class action lawsuit brought by plaintiffs in California, Florida, Maryland and Pennsylvania, who argued that Google violated provisions of the Federal Wiretap Act and the Federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act. Though it might appear that Google is abusing consumer trust built over years of users’ familiarity with their services, their actions are reasonable.
The lawsuit alleges that Google violates state and federal provisions against wiretapping when they scan emails for word trends in order to tailor advertisements to specific sets of users. This means that if an individual emailed one of his or her friends about a certain USC football game, then he or she would probably receive football-related ads. This tactic is startling because it raises questions about Google’s power to search seemingly private communications.
But opponents of Google’s rather broad assertions have blown this out of proportion. Some Internet privacy groups characterize the company’s actions as being blanket searches for consumer data; after all, only Google knows where the advertising data ends up, or for how long they keep it. This, however, is a gross overestimation of Google’s use of their resources.
To begin with, any Gmail user sending a message to another Gmail user has the ability to turn off tailored advertisements, and Google also provides the user with the resources to remove their personal information from Gmail and other Google services. The greatest legal and ethical question, therefore, concerns emails sent to users outside of Gmail.
To students using outside providers email for their jobs or in their everyday lives, Google’s use of their personal data might seem like a shock. In this regard, automated processes that look for single words in order to formulate consumer trends are hardly something to worry about. Google online combines data containing specific words and storing them on another computer’s memory. This is easily differentiated from a person executing a search on someone’s computer. Such a search would require a specific purpose apart from numbers and trends. For this reason, Google’s practices in no way conflict with the Fourth Amendment or other constitutional arguments.
Google said its users “voluntarily convey[s] numerical information to the telephone company and ‘exposes’ that information to its equipment in the ordinary course of business.”
It’s no surprise, then, that many courts have followed this line of reasoning when deciding in favor of so many companies, going all the way back to the Smith v. Maryland case of 1979, which was the earliest court case that Google cited in its arguments. As long as the processes remain automated, there remains no concern that the data is being mishandled or misappropriated in some way.
Google’s services are massively popular and enjoyed by more than one billion people worldwide, in over 181 countries. This ruling will have an impact on future forms of communication and the standing of other Internet service providers in the near future, but the public must recognize that it isn’t as bad as it seems.

The International Olympic Committee recently chose Tokyo over Istanbul and Madrid as the site for the 2020 Olympic Games. Despite great anticipation over the prospect of Istanbul becoming the first predominantly Muslim city to host the Olympics, recent anti-government protests combined with regional instability emanating from the Syrian conflict pushed the IOC to deem Tokyo the safest of bid cities, according to the Washington Post.
Arnav Garg| Daily Trojan
Though it is easy to express excitement for this event, it is important to recognize that the Olympics could potentially become burdensome for Japan in the years to come.
Dubbed the “Curse of the Olympics,” host countries frequently go into economic shambles following the games. In 2009, the Telegraph reported that Beijing “suffers from the curse of the Olympics” after hosting the games in 2008.
According to CBC News, “government figures show Britain is still mired in recession despite all the recent Olympic spending.”
The amount of money spent developing infrastructure to host for just a few short weeks sends these nations into debt. The Montreal Olympics of 1976 take the cake for experiencing the worst post-Olympics failure. According to CBS News, the city went 796 percent over budget, and painstakingly continued to pay off its debt until 2006. According to Bloomberg Businessweek, Athens had a similar situation — the host city for the 2004 Olympics is estimated to have spent about 5 percent of Greece’s GDP on the Games, leaving the economy in ruins and even contributing to its recent economic crash.
Many Japanese people savored the good news. After all, many hoped for the bid after the devastating earthquake that struck the country in March of 2011. According to the Wall Street Journal, they were ecstatic that  the Olympics would give Japan the economic boost it needs to help it shake off its lagging economy and rebuild from the consequences of the recent natural disaster.
But in a country that is still struggling to clean up the aftermath of the earthquake and nuclear fiasco, the Olympics will do more harm than good. Out of 37 venues planned for the Games, the city has promised to construct 22 from scratch. It expects to spend an estimated one billion dollars on refurbishing the stadium from the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, according to CNN.
Total construction cost is expected to come in at about $4.1 billion. It is not appropriate to spend this money for what is essentially a large party that lasts for a few weeks. There are no guarantees that it will benefit a country suffering from a straggling economy, declining population and an aging demography — just to name a few of Japan’s many problems.
Though it is easy to rejoice, the Japanese people should examine the reality of the issue: Following initial hype and euphoria lies a serious dilemma.
