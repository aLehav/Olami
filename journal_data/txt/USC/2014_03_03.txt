The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Friday, Feb.28, and Saturday, March 1. 
Crimes against a person
at 5:05 p.m. on March 1, a student reported to DPS that her roommate had pushed her and hit her with a loaf of bread during an argument. The second student denied making physical contact with the reporting student when questioned by DPS officers but admitted to throwing bread at her. Temporary housing was consequently arranged for the reporting student due to ongoing problems with her roommate.
Crimes against property
at 3:00 p.m. on Feb. 28, the property manager of 2727 Menlo Ave. reported to DPS that the building was damaged by water when students who resided at the location left water overflowing.
at 6:13 a.m. on March 1, DPS officers detained a suspect who was seen carrying a locked bicycle on 27th Street and Figueroa Street. The officers were unable to locate the owner of the property so the bike was impounded at the DPS office and the suspect was released at the scene.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 12:30 a.m. on March 1,  DPS officers responded to an intoxicated non-USC female who chipped a tooth outside of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. An Los Angeles Fire Department Rescue Ambulance unit was requested but the woman declined transportation for medical treatment. The officers concluded that the female was unable to care for herself and could not locate anyone to care for her. As a result, she was arrested and transported to Metropolitan Detention Center for booking.

Researchers at the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics published a series of papers in the March edition of Health Affairs focusing on HIV/AIDS treatment and the impact of the Affordable Care Act on those living with the disease. The researchers found that early treatment for the disease was important in preventing transmission and extending life expectancy and that full implementation of the ACA would greatly expand HIV screenings leading to more successful diagnoses.
Dana P. Goldman, Leonard D. Schaeffer Chair and director of the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, along with co-authors, examined the effect of combination antiretroviral treatment on HIV transmission and prevention. Their research found that early-stage treatment prevented 188,700 new cases and saved $128 billion in life expectancy costs.
Meanwhile, John A. Romley of the USC Schaeffer Center and co-authors found that early treatment of HIV can add years to life expectancy. Those who began treatment when their CD4 white blood cell counts were above 500 gained an average of 9.1 years, compared to 6.1 for those who initiated treatment when their counts were between 350 and 500. They estimate the value of survival gains at $80 billion between 1996 and 2009. Both studies used $150,000 as the value of a life-year.
Researcher Zachary Wagner and colleagues examined the impact of the ACA on the fight against HIV/AIDS. It is good news for the Obama administration as the researchers found that by 2017,  an additional 466,153 people will be screened for the disease, reducing the population of those living with the disease but unaware by 22 percent.

Since 2002, USC has enrolled more international students than any other school in the United States. According to the Institute of International Education’s Open Doors Report, published last year, USC was ranked No. 1 in international student attendance with a total of 9,840. As recently as 2010, the number was just 7,987, indicating a 23 percent increase in international student enrollment at the university.
A number of factors have contributed to USC’s growing international student population. USC’s strong reputation both nationally and internationally, along with the university’s global recruiting from USC offices in regions such as Beijing, Brazil, Hong Kong, India, Korea, Mexico, Shanghai and Taiwan, have kept USC a popular option abroad. Alumni living overseas also regularly hold luncheons, happy hours and professional mixers for admitted students in different cities around the world.
On campus, the Office of International Services is a resource center that helps international students achieve their academic, personal and professional goals, and make the most of their USC experience.
Anne Kaufman, assistant director at the OIS, said the OIS supports international students during their transition to            full-time students in the United States.
“OIS provides a wide range of social, cultural, immigration and career-related services and programs to meet the needs of the international student and scholar population at USC,” Kaufman said. “For example, each year, OIS matches over 200 students with families in the Los Angeles area to share a traditional Thanksgiving dinner together. Families invite students into their homes and teach them about this typical American experience. This program is a highlight for students during their time at USC. Many of the students and families remain friendly after the event.”
Kaufman also said that the office organizes multiple social events throughout the year for international students.
“OIS also participates in the U.S. Department of State’s International Education Week,” she said. “During this week, OIS collaborates with the International Students’ Assembly to provide cultural programs and events. In 2013, OIS hosted an International Fashion Show where students modeled traditional dress from their country, as well as a henna event, in which students from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh demonstrated the beautiful art of painting henna designs on the hands and arms of other students.”
Apart from OIS, each year the International Student Association hosts its annual International Food Fair, which brings together fine cuisine and culture from an array of different countries around the world.
In recent years, as the international student body continues to grow, a few countries have stood out significantly in terms of growth. China has grown by dramatic leaps and bounds to become the leader in international student enrollment at USC, taking the top spot from India in 2010. The university is also seeking ways to expand in Latin America, having opened an office in Sao Paulo, Brazil last year.
“The University of Southern California community is eager to build even stronger ties with Brazil and to lay a solid foundation for long-standing, mutually beneficial collaborations,” said University President C. L. Max Nikias in an official statement following the opening. “Brazil will play a particularly vital role in these partnerships, given its strategic location in the Pacific Rim and USC’s ambition to attract the world’s most talented and creative students.”
The  top majors for international students in 2013 differ between the graduate and undergraduate levels. Graduate enrollment was very high for international students in computer science and engineering while undergraduate’s top choices for majors were business administration, accounting and economics. This only offers a glimpse into the most common majors for international students, while a wide variety of concentrations include international students as well.
Nigar Rasulova, a native of Azerbaijan who is a first-year graduate student at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and pursuing a graduate certificate from the Marshall School of Business, enjoys the campus environment.
“I like the fact that international students are being treated on the same terms as domestic students and are required to comply with the highest standards of the university. For example, one will be required to not only write grammatically correct but also stylistically as well,” Rasulova said.
One issue that international students must face is the reality of what to do following the completion of their studies. All international students are entitled to a 12-month work authorization following graduation, with STEM majors getting an additional 17 months for a total of 29 months given the demand for employees with these degrees in the United States.
The real challenge is one that many domestic students find themselves in right now as well: finding and obtaining a full-time job. Being an international student, however, can provide more barriers.
“In order to remain in the U.S. long-term you need an employer to sponsor an H1-B visa, which can be difficult in the current job market,” said Huaye Deng, who graduated in December with a bachelor’s in accounting. “However, the benefits of a USC degree cannot be understated and I was able to find a full-time job only two months after graduation in Beverly Hills.”

On Monday, the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism announced it had raised more than $100 million since launching its major fundraising initiative in the fall of 2012.
Annenberg’s fundraising initiative is part of a larger university-wide campaign to raise $6 billion to improve academic programs and outreach throughout the university.
Fundraiser · The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism has raised more than $100 million of its $150 million fundraising goal. — Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
The school’s goal is to raise $150 million by June 2018. The initiative coincides with the construction of Wallis Annenberg Hall, which will open in fall of 2014. Much of the technology featured in the new building will be paid for by these donations.
According to Annenberg News, the final donation that allowed them to reach the $100 million mark came from Denise Novoselski in memory of her husband, Tim. The Novoselskis both attended USC in the 1970s and met while working at the Daily Trojan. Tim came to Annenberg on a scholarship.
“Shortly after Tim died, I was considering bequests and I thought it was important to give another young person an opportunity like Tim had,” Denise Novoselski told Annenberg News. “Helping those who want to go into journalism is critically important.”
Annenberg reports contributions from more than 3,000 donors, 88 percent of whom gave less than $1 thousand. Seventy-nine percent of donations came from alumni.
In addition to the establishment of scholarship funds and increased investment in digital technologies, an Annenberg spokesperson also said the money will go toward the endowment of the Jayne and Hans Hufschmid Chair in Strategic Public Relations and Business Communication. This will  contribute to the interdisciplinary study and research into the intersection of communication and business.
The spokesperson also said that a donation from Thomas Campbell Jackson and Penny Jackson will establish a science and technology fellowship for the USC Annenberg Master’s of Specialized Journalism program.
Diana Bernal O’Leary, associate dean of development and external relations for USC Annenberg, said the fundraising effort was a good representation of the lifelong commitment to the Trojan community.
“This is a great example of the dedication of the Trojan Family,” O’Leary said in an email. “Alumni, parents and friends nationwide — and even a few around the globe — have made supporting USC Annenberg a priority,” O’Leary said in an email. “We are grateful and inspired by their generosity.”
Novoselski told Annenberg News her husband would have been proud to be a part of such an influential campaign.
“Tim never would have envisioned that he would be memorialized with an endowment to USC that was to become so significant.”

Unusual scoring led to unusual results for the USC men’s golf team on Monday afternoon, as the team finished deadlocked in a tie with crosstown rival UCLA. The No. 23 Trojans, coming off of their second runner-up finish of the season at the Jones Invitational, met the No. 22 Bruins in a one-day match play event.
On the rise · Junior Anthony Paolucci won his first individual collegiate event last week at the Jones Invitational and entered yesterday’s match against UCLA as the Trojans’ top seed. He won his head-to-head matchup 2-1. – Courtesy of USC Sports Information
Action consisted of eight players from each team clashing in one-on-one rounds of 18 holes, with each head-to-head victory resulting in a team point. Points were also awarded to the player with the lowest score on the front and back nines, allowing for three points to be earned in each match. Fittingly for such evenly matched squads, the Trojans and Bruins split the 24 available points at Valley Golf Club in Santa Barbara, Calif.
Though the match was an exhibition and will not count toward either team’s overall record, USC head coach Chris Zambri still felt unsatisfied with the results.
“We ended up tying the match, so it wasn’t the outcome that either team was looking for,” Zambri said. “Some of our guys played well, some didn’t.”
One Trojan who did play well was junior Anthony Paolucci, who won his first collegiate tournament at the Jones Invitational last week. Playing in the competitive No. 1 slot, Paolucci took two of three points from his opponent.
Other winners for USC included All-American senior Jeffrey Kang, who scored a 2-1 victory in the No. 3 slot. Junior Paul Smith scored USC’s biggest win, taking 2.5 points at No. 4. Senior Ramsey Sahyoun also picked up a 2-1 win.
Freshman Rico Hoey, playing at No. 2, tied his opponent with 1.5 points apiece. The Trojans’ other players, junior Eric Sugimoto, sophomore Bobby Gojuangco and freshman Danny Ochoa, took losses.
Though the results did not end up quite how he had hoped, Zambri admitted that exhibition matches, especially against a rival such as  UCLA, are worthwhile.
“It was a very fun day at a beautiful golf course,” Zambri said. “The kids are lucky to be able to do things like we did today. It was a great experience.”
USC and UCLA have historically met in match play at different points throughout the season, though this was the first year the format expanded to eight players per team. Last year the two teams met at Bel Air Country Club late in the season as a tune-up for the Pac-12 Championships. Unsurprisingly, that match also ended in a tie.
This year’s contest was designed to keep both teams sharp before tournament action picks up again. The Trojans will head to the San Diego Classic at the San Diego Country Club beginning next Monday, while the Bruins tee off in the Collegiate Masters in Las Vegas over the weekend. Action in both events can be followed live at golfstat.com.

Saturday marked the final home game of the 2013-14 season for the USC men’s basketball team, and with it the final home game I (and every other soon-to-be-graduate) will ever attend as a student.
I must say, it’s been quite a ride.
This is my third and final year at USC (I transferred in after one year at Arizona State), and over the past three seasons I have borne witness to some truly frustrating basketball.
In the three years since USC’s last NCAA Tournament appearance, the Trojans have racked up a 22-27 home record, going 8-19 against Pac-12 foes, including three losses to rival UCLA by an average margin of 15 points.
Three different head coaches have graced the sidelines, though none kept the Trojans relevant late into the season. The latest date USC has held a winning record in three years was Jan. 26 of this year, when a 79-71 overtime loss to Stanford dropped the team’s record to 10-10 and served as the first of 10 consecutive losses, a streak that is still going strong.
Within the team’s current skid is the longest home losing streak at six games. USC’s average home attendance in the past three seasons is 4,189 people per game. Of the 49 home games in the last three seasons, only eight have filled the Galen Center to above 50 percent capacity.
Now that all of that is out of the way, let’s stop dwelling on the program’s many low points and try to focus on the positives (a tall task, to be sure, but it can be done). Here’s a look at the top five men’s basketball/Galen Center moments of the past three seasons.
5. Salute to a Legend
On Jan. 15, 2012, USC retired the jersey of its all-time leading scorer, Harold Miner. In his prolific three-year college career, Miner averaged more than 23 points per game and finished with 2,048 total points, both school records. Miner’s junior season, in which he averaged a single-season school record of 26.3 points per game, earned him the honor of being named Sports Illustrated magazine’s college basketball player of the year, beating out stars such as Duke’s Christian Laettner, LSU’s Shaquille O’Neal and Georgetown’s Alonzo Mourning.
Despite this being such a momentous occasion for Miner, there was little to cheer about on this night, as USC lost to UCLA 66-47. Still, it was a meaningful gesture for the greatest player in program history.
4. Top of the Standings
On its surface, USC’s 71-69 win over Stanford on Jan. 3, 2013 doesn’t seem like a big deal. The team won a close game against a respectable program thanks to clutch plays down the stretch. But this victory would mark the only time in the past three seasons that the Trojans were undefeated in Pac-12 play. This also served as USC’s last home win under former head coach Kevin O’Neill, who  Athletic Director Pat Haden fired 11 days later.
3. The First Step is the Hardest
It took him six chances, but current head coach Andy Enfield finally notched his first Pac-12 victory on Jan. 22, 2014 with a 77-69 win over Cal, which was unbeaten in conference play at the time. The Trojans never trailed throughout the night and saw a stellar performance from freshman forward Nikola Jovanovic, who flashed the promise of becoming a consistent offensive threat for Enfield moving forward.
Enfield has yet to reach his second win, but in a game that also saw key contributions from guards Byron Wesley and Julian Jacobs, the signs of hope for the future were on display.
2. End on a High Note
In the final home game of the 2012-13 season, USC held off a late ASU rally to seal a 57-56 victory. This game marked the last Galen Center appearance for several seniors, most notably point guard Jio Fontan.
Fontan transferred to USC in January of 2010 and was integral in leading the Trojans to the 2011 NCAA Tournament. Fontan missed all of the 2011-12 season after tearing his ACL and had to watch from the bench as the team amassed a 6-26 record. He returned the next season and played in all 32 games, in which he served as a model team captain and beloved fan favorite.
This game also proved to be former interim head coach Bob Cantu’s last victory. USC went 7-8 under Cantu’s lead, and after losing to Utah in the first round of the 2013 Pac-12 Tournament, Haden named Enfield as Cantu’s replacement three weeks later.
 
1. Court Storming
 
Though fewer than 5,000 fans were on hand to see it, USC’s biggest win in the past three years came on Feb. 27, 2013, when the Trojans took down then-No. 11 Arizona.
USC never trailed in the second half and shot a scintillating 61.1 percent from the field. It was the program’s lone home victory over a ranked team in the last three years. For those who were there to storm the court in celebration of last year’s upset, that night ranks among the most memorable basketball moments.
 
I’ll be honest: Coming up with five joyful moments from home basketball games in the last three years was not that easy. There were plenty of blowout losses and comebacks that fell just short to sort through to find these five gems. But many of my fondest memories of my college experience took place at the Galen Center, even in watching the Trojans fight on in a losing effort. It might not have always been pretty, and at times it was downright painful, but I think there’s something to be gained from staying loyal to your team, even in defeat.
Besides, patience is one of the best life lessons you can learn in college, and it’s safe to say that I gained plenty of that during my nights spent watching this hard-luck team.

The USC women’s golf team was back in action yesterday at the Bruin Wave Invitational in Tarzana, Calif., just a week after from having its remarkable string of eight straight victories broken at the Allstate Sugar Bowl.

The No. 1 Women of Troy put themselves in good position to start a new winning streak following a marathon 36-hole effort, using a late surge to overtake No. 15 Pepperdine and No. 2 UCLA for first place. The Bruins sit five strokes behind USC with a combined 2-over, followed by closely by the Waves at 5-over. USC fell to its crosstown rival in New Orleans on Feb. 25, and UCLA is the only other team to receive a first-place vote in the latest NCAA rankings. No. 13 Oklahoma State stands well off the pace at 15-over, and rounding out the top five was No. 10 Arizona at 18-over.
The Women of Troy were sluggish out of the gate, stumbling to a disappointing 8-over in the day’s first round. The team returned to form with a strong second-round effort, however, sparked by the dominant play of junior Doris Chen. Chen, who came into the event as the team’s fifth seed, added a blistering 5-under 67 to a solid even-par first round. A birdie on her penultimate hole allowed the Bradenton, Fla. native to sneak past a group that included sophomore Kyung Kim for the individual lead. Head coach Andrea Gaston felt her team’s bounce-back effort was impressive in difficult conditions.
“[The team] made a tremendous comeback this afternoon,” Gaston said. “They did a great job composing themselves after a tough first round.”
USC’s most consistent performance came from Kim, who turned in two scores of 2-under to tie for second place. Kim, Oklahoma State’s Julie Yang and UCLA’s Alison Lee are each just one stroke behind the pace set by Chen. Sophomore Annie Park, the team’s No. 1 seed, rebounded from a discouraging 5-over with a 4-under 68 over the final 18 holes. Park’s combined score of 1-over puts her in a ninth-place tie with UCLA’s Louise Ridderstrom and UNC’s Lori Beth Adams.
Senior Sophia Popov also struggled for the Women of Troy, but was able to end on a strong note with an even-par 72 in the second round. The three-time All-American already has two top-10 finishes this spring. Freshman Gabriella Then’s 12-over, a team-worst, was not included in USC’s combined score.
Gaston felt her team made some key shots down the stretch to secure the lead.
“They hit some great shots and, fortunately, made a few lengthy putts to take us deep,” the 18th-year coach said. “[El Caballero Country Club] is a very difficult golf course that requires a lot of patience.”
USC will attempt to hold off the rival Bruins when action resumes at El Caballero C.C. with tomorrow’s final round. The Women of Troy won this tournament last season, part of a stretch that included 11 wins in 12 matches and an NCAA championship. Also victorious at the 2013 event was Park, the first of four wins that the then-freshman picked up on her way to an individual national title. Tomorrow’s round can be followed live at golfstat.com.

Coming off its first loss of the season to the Long Beach State Dirtbags, USC’s baseball team faced an unusual Southern California weekend of thunderstorms and flooding, which led to a cancelled game on Friday, a postponed game on Saturday and finally a doubleheader on Sunday against the Cal Poly Mustangs.
Work horse · Senior Bob Wheatley, who has spent the second-most time on the mound for the Trojans this season, enters tonight’s game against the Anteaters with an 0.47 ERA. Opponents are hitting .179 against him. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Perhaps this unexpected break arrived at an ideal time for the Trojans, considering they ended the weekend on a high note in a 16-0 shutout in game two of the doubleheader. The Trojans turned all 16 of their hits into runs thanks to stellar hitting by the starting lineup, especially senior catcher Jake Hernandez, who went 4-5 at the plate.
Senior starting pitcher Bob Wheatley complemented his teammates’ impressive at-bat efforts by allowing only two hits during his seven innings of work, while striking out a career-high of 10 players.
Wheatley thinks Sunday night’s success will definitely affect the way the Trojans enter tonight’s game against the UC Irvine Anteaters at Anteater Ballpark.
“It’s a confidence boost any time you can put that many runs on the board, especially against a really good team like Cal Poly,” Wheatley said. “The biggest challenge going into tonight’s game will be responding to Sunday’s big win by remembering why and how we won and trying to repeat those actions again to be successful against UCI.”
The Anteaters are led by head coach Mike Gillespie, who was a left-fielder for the Trojans in his college days and was the head coach at USC for 20 years. He led the Trojans to 15 postseason appearances and was named National Coach of the Year by Collegiate Baseball and the American Baseball Coaches Association after leading the Trojans to the national title in 1998.
The Anteaters currently hold an 8-3 overall record and a 5-3 mark at home. UCI will be coming into tonight’s game off of a 5-3 win against Portland last Saturday.
Despite the Anteaters’ early successes this season, USC head coach Dan Hubbs believes the Trojans will be victorious if they keep up their good hitting streak and play “unselfishly.”
“We’re swinging the bat pretty well right now, so we just have to string those at-bats together,” Hubbs said. “We call it playing unselfishly in terms of offense, meaning that the guys need to not try to hit doubles but instead try to hit the ball up the middle and advance runners to give ourselves a chance to win.”
The Trojans will also have to adjust in other ways to prepare for tonight’s game, considering it will be the first time this season they take on the Anteaters at Anteater Ballpark.
“Playing UCI is tough because it’s a big ballpark, so not a lot of balls go out as far, and it’s cold so the ball doesn’t travel as well,” Wheatley said. “Every game I’ve played there has been a low-scoring game because of these challenges, but in my experience, the team that executes the offensive play the best is who’s going to win.”
In terms of pitching, both staffs appear fairly evenly matched, given that the Trojans currently boast a 2.07 ERA compared to the Anteaters’ 1.36.
Despite UCI’s slightly better average in this respect, Hubbs feels that the Trojans actually hold the advantage and are more than capable of handling the Anteater pitching staff.
“We probably have a little bit more arm strength than they do, but they have good pitchers too who can pitch us off balance,” Hubbs said. “I feel confident that whoever’s pitching staff we face, we can match up on the mound.”
In terms of lineup, Hubbs plans on keeping most of the starting players from game two of last Sunday night, with the exception of freshman Jeremy Martinez switching to designated hitter and junior Garrett Stubbs coming in as catcher. Sophomore Brent Wheatley will likely be the starting pitcher.
UCI will be the only away game this week before the Trojans return to Dedeaux Field for the weekend. Hubbs believes that perhaps the team’s strongest asset entering tonight’s game is its increasing confidence in its abilities both offensively and defensively.
“We know that Irvine is playing really well right now and that they are well-coached,” Hubbs said. “We have to play well to beat them. If we play well, we’re gonna have a good chance to win.”

In Coffee and Crepes, a restaurant on Cesar Chavez Avenue, 15 watercolors depicting Antonio Guerrero’s life in prison will be featured through March 30. The exhibit, called “I Will Die the Way I Lived” and organized by the Ciudad de Libertad, aims to promote awareness of Guerrero and the Cuban Five — five Cubans who the Ciudad de Libertad believes were wrongly incarcerated for spying on anti-Cuban terrorist groups while in Florida.
This political element defines the exhibition, and those who visit should expect to engage in a political, rather than a historical, art discourse with the paintings. Guerrero learned to paint while in prison, taking lessons from fellow inmates, and as such, the watercolors are simple. One of the organizers, Professor Carlos Ugalde from Glendale College, has written a letter to President Barack Obama and hopes that this exhibit will inspire people to sign it. As such, any attendants should not expect art in the vein of Van Gogh, but in the vein of Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. Ugalde brought up the Rivera quote, “All art is political,” and this exhibit serves as a testament to that.
Norton Sandler, another coordinator, also stressed the political aspects of the exhibit.
“Well, our goal is to win support for the release of the five,” said Sandler. “[On Feb. 27] Fernando Gonzales was released from prison. He’s the second of the five to be released. The other three are serving long, long sentences, and we’re trying to raise awareness of this injustice and raise support for the release of the other three. These paintings focus on conditions in prison, especially in the beginning of the incarceration.”
Though the watercolors do not exhibit aesthetic mastery, their political power is significant. One of the paintings, “El Recibimiento (The Welcoming),” depicts Guerrero’s arrival in prison. A ratty bed with a roll of toilet paper greets the viewer, and bilingual signs tell the story of Guerrero’s entrance into “the hole,” otherwise known as solitary confinement. These signs, which tell stories of resistance and craftiness, provide the brunt of the exhibition’s power.
After all, these paintings tell a story from a prisoner’s perspective. A picture of an air vent holds no power, but the story of how Guerrero could use that air vent to read poetry to his Cuban brothers holds meaning. This emphasis on a prisoner’s point of view transforms mundane objects into compelling political symbols, with an example being “Ajedrez (Chess),” which depicts a chessboard that the Cuban Five created out of the few objects granted them. For those interested in the incarceration from the viewpoint of the incarcerated, these pictures serve as a look into America’s prison system.
The exhibition also shows the power of alternative media. Ugalde expressed the lack of knowledge on the Cuban Five, due to the lack of mass media backing. Though one of the five was released a week ago, Ugalde says, no articles were written on his release or on this continuing issue.
The small venue allows for an intimate experience with the organizers, who hope to be present as much as possible. A poetry reading will be held on March 14 and a film will be screened on March 30. This alternative to other art galleries, such as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, provides one-on-one discussion and community involvement, which, given the political nature of the pieces, seems necessary.
Those looking for simple viewing without politics should not attend this exhibit, but those who hope to learn more about an ongoing issue in international relations should attend. The printed text does a good job of contextualizing the issue, showing the recent release of Gonzales, and the benefit concert held in his name in Cuba.
Though this might seem strange to most modern viewers of art, this is what the exhibit aims to do, and does so successfully. The organizers have made it clear that this is a didactic move, so for people who wish to be taught the intimacy of it, it makes it indispensible. Those who already know of the Cuban Five, or have already made up their minds, however, need not attend, unless they’re looking for a political conversation or hoping to sign Ciudad de Libertad’s letter to the president.
But will it make new converts to Ciudad de Libertad’s cause? That is difficult to say. The art, even coupled with the writing, does not seem powerful enough to do so, but maybe the intimate connection with the docents will.

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about old movie theaters in Los Angeles. Maybe it’s because I’m taking a film review class that has had me going to the movies each week. Maybe it’s because I just finished re-reading Daniel Handler’s Why We Broke Up, which, in a way, is an ode to old Hollywood glamour. Maybe the rain is just making me sentimental. Whatever it is, as I watched celebrities walk the red carpet at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on Sunday, I kept thinking about the history and legacy of film in Los Angeles.
Sometimes, it’s all too easy to see the presence of Hollywood in Los Angeles. Who hasn’t seen paparazzi (the word coined by the Italian masterpiece La Dolce Vita) flashing their bulbs to get a shot of a celebrity walking out of their car? If you’re looking for a taste of Hollywood glamour, take a stroll on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, peek inside the TCL Chinese Theatre, or just get a milkshake at Mel’s Drive-In. You might even see Marilyn Monroe’s ghost (don’t worry, just a bit of tinseltown magic).
But I’ve never really looked deeper than the bottom of a discount movie poster barrel to find some authentic Hollywood history. I’d never been to the Egyptian Theatre, for example, which hosted the first red carpet event in 1922. Movie stars such as Mary Pickford and Charlie Chaplin would frequent the site to see their movies and their friends’ movies. It’s a big part of cinema history, but one that is often overlooked. So I thought, why not look into it?
“It is kind of amazing that we still have [these theaters],” Margot Gerber, the historian for the American Cinematheque, told me over the phone. “Los Angeles has always been very quick to tear things down and put up new things. We’ve lost some great movie palaces that were unceremoniously torn down.”
But it is no easy feat to preserve these buildings. The cost is prohibitive and there is no strong financial support coming from any of the movie studios to pay for maintenance and repairs. Many of these old theaters today have found second lives as churches, which at least allows the integrity of the building’s architecture to remain. Others have been torn down, partially or completely. During the early part of the 20th century, however, these single-screen theaters served as one of the primary sources of entertainment for Angelenos.
“In Los Angeles, going to the theater was really big,” Gerber said. “In the ’20s, ’30s, there was not a lot of competition. It was a cheap form of entertainment. Everyone went.”
As television began to catch on, in addition to the home viewing experiences — first through VHS tapes and then through DVDs and streaming services, such as Netflix and Hulu — it has become harder to get people back to the theater. Especially for the historic theaters that screen classic, foreign and indie films, which are economically at a disadvantage to the newer chain theaters that have six different screens and predominantly show blockbuster films. Still, Gerber said that these historic theater palaces have recently been experiencing a surge in popularity.
“I’m not sure why exactly, but this past year or two has really been great for revival cinema, specialty cinema,” Gerber said. “There’s a lot of screening programs going on, in a lot of screening venues. There’s interest in going in-person to the movie theater, seeing great cinema classics.”
In Downtown Los Angeles, for example, many of the theaters that sat neglected for ages due to the area’s dilapidated real estate are now beginning to be brought back to life. Through programs such as the Los Angeles Conservancy’s “The Last Remaining Seats,” these historic sites are slowly starting to establish themselves. The Million Dollar Theatre even hosted its own Oscars viewing party Sunday night.
“It used to be there was an interest for this in Hollywood or the Westside or LACMA in mid-Wilshire, but now it’s extending to Downtown,” Gerber said. “With the new housing opening up, people want these services in their neighborhood.”
Gerber speculates that the recent popularity of these theaters is a pushback among audiences, many of whom grew up watching DVDs and now streaming services at home, but want a more personal experience when they watch their movies.
“People want to see movies the way they were meant to be seen, on the big screen, not cut up. The viewing experience is different,” Gerber said. “There is a generation of people who grew up with ability to pop in a DVD, but have never seen these films as they were originally presented.”
There is something to be said for that. Netflix is great for binge-watching House of Cards, but I could never use it to see my favorite film, Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore’s Cinema Paradiso, which won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 1989. At least not in the way it was meant to be seen.
Another Italian director took home the Oscar this Sunday for Best Foreign Film. The movie, The Great Beauty, has already been compared to Cinema Paradiso. I haven’t had the chance to see it yet, but I know when I do, it’s the kind of film made to be seen properly, in one of these theaters, continuing a tradition that Los Angeles has built its reputation on. Because it’s these theaters that hold the real tinseltown magic.

Lea Michele has had a rough year: The talented Broadway star and lead character of the hit TV show Glee suffered the loss of her onscreen and offscreen boyfriend, Cory Monteith. Instead of allowing this to keep her down, however, Michele found peace in her art, returning to Glee and attempting to branch out into a new market. Though Michele has conquered the theater and television markets with much success, her new endeavor is the pop music industry. Her first solo album, Louder, was released yesterday by Columbia Records.
The album’s opening track, “Cannonball,” a mid-tempo power ballad about new beginnings reminiscent of Miley Cyrus’s “Wrecking Ball,” is a clear standout on the album. Michele has said she felt an instant emotional connection with the song, which was written by popular songwriter Sia Furler and Benny Blanco, the writers of Rihanna’s “Diamonds” and Beyoncé’s “Pretty Hurts,” after being presented with it due to the recent death of Monteith.
“Cannonball” has what pop music should: catchy hooks, a great beat, powerful vocals and quality lyrical content. Michele is known for her powerful pipes, a vocal style uncommon in pop music today. In “Cannonball,” she uses her strengths for the right reasons, shining brightly on the chorus while making sure not to overwhelm the song as a whole with her voice. Unfortunately, not all tracks on Louder match the standard set by the album’s opening track; in fact, most pale in comparison. Louder’s biggest downfall is the album’s title track, featuring a very musical theater sing-scream over a dull dance beat.
That is not to say the album is all downhill after the first track. “Battlefield,” another song written by Furler and Lawrence Goldings specifically for Michele. The  beautiful piano-driven ballad compares a relationship gone wrong to a battlefield. Listeners will find a common theme here: Furler and Michele make a great team, and most of the album’s standout tracks are co-written by Furler.
The minimal amount of Lea Michele’s own penmanship might also be to blame for the album’s disconnect; with Michele writing on just three out of the album’s 11 songs, Louder’s tracks sound like they were picked based on what Michele’s vocals are capable of, and not necessarily her personal experiences. Rather than sticking to a small team of writers and producers, Louder is a hodgepodge of different sounds, ranging to either extreme on the quality scale.
The album had the potential to become a great cohesive group of pop music, but instead Louder feels like the soundtrack to a dramatic Broadway musical with a lead actress who won’t let anyone else share the microphone with her.
It is unlikely that Michele will release a sophomore LP after Louder’s lack of critical acclaim. This does not mean that Michele can by any means be viewed as a failure — she explored a new realm of her career outside of her comfort zone, expressed her emotions after a traumatizing time in her life and created a few great songs in the process. Michele has a hit television show to return to, a setting in which she flourishes, and her first lead role to take on in the upcoming major film Legends of Oz: Dorothy’s Return, set to be released this May. Though Louder is bound to be passed by without much attention, ignore the filler and check out the gems on the album: “Cannonball,” “Battlefield,” “Thousand Needles” and “If You Say So.” Unfortunately, there is a large portion of fat that was never cut off of the album before its release, hiding some of the highest quality meat that 2014’s pop music industry has offered us so far.

As raves and music festivals have come into the mainstream over the past several years, more and more young people are listening to Electronic Dance Music. Contrary to popular belief, the term “Electronic Dance Music,” or “EDM,” is not synonymous with “dubstep.” Rather, dubstep is a subgenre within the EDM genre, where it is joined by dozens of other subgenres, including house, trance, drum and bass and hardstyle.
Most EDM festivals feature artists who primarily play dubstep, house and sometimes drum and bass. Hardstyle, with tracks typically around 150 beats per minute, usually features reversed bass lines and a kick drum sound. The subgenre is notorious for inspiring an irrepressible urge to dance. Hardstyle is relatively new to the U.S. EDM scene, but has been gaining popularity over the past several years.
On Saturday, March 8, USC students will have the opportunity to experience hardstyle just five minutes away from campus. Q-dance, a Dutch hardstyle event organizer, is putting on a show at the Shrine called “The Sound of Q-dance.” The show boasts a lineup of hardstyle DJs and producers including Brennan Heart, Frontliner, The Prophet, Lady Faith, Sylence, Mr. Skeleton and MC Villain.
Fabian Bohn, a hardstyle producer and DJ from the Netherlands, produces most of his tracks under the name Brennan Heart. In terms of the type of music he produces, Bohn emphasized that he is interested in thinking outside of the box when it comes to new tracks.
“Since the first day I wrote music, I always wrote stuff between trance, techno and a lot of other subgenres, and I think it’s really interesting to combine that stuff with hardstyle,” Bohn said. “It’s not just a hardstyle track. I always try to write something next-level to bring something else.”
Bohn also felt that the word “hardstyle” might give people the wrong impression about what the subgenre is all about.
“I don’t like the word ‘hardstyle,’” Bohn said. “I don’t like the name by itself because it sounds like it’s ridiculously hard and really a bit dark or something, but the genre by itself could be quite interesting if you think out of the box.”
Thinking outside the box includes making crossover tracks that combine other subgenres and adding vocals to hardstyle tracks. Bohn set a trend for vocals in hardstyle in his track “Lose My Mind” with DJ Wildstylez. Since the track was released in 2012, vocals have become more frequent in tracks within the subgenre.
The subgenre has evolved in other ways as well. The hardstyle scene has been popular in Holland and Europe for the past decade, but Bohn has noticed some recent changes.
“In the last few years it got more euphoric, more mixed with pop and vocals,” Bohn said. “For example, my latest track with Jonathan Mendelsohn, ‘Imaginary,’ that’s like a pop song with a hardstyle kind of production.”
He predicts that the subgenre will continue to evolve in this way.
“These days it’s really important to make a good overall song, and five to six years ago it was more about the kinds of sounds and the build-up and the drop, so in my opinion, it’s gonna evolve even more, and I think hardstyle will grow up to a sound that’s between house and what it is right now,” Bohn said.
Bohn also noted some differences between the hardstyle scene in the United States and in Europe. Since hardstyle has been popular in Europe for the past decade, audiences there expect hardstyle performers to play a familiar kind of sound, based on the traditional hardcore sound that originated in Holland. On the contrary, audiences in the United States tend to be more open to variations in hardstyle’s typical sound.
“[Americans] are all so open. When I want to play in the States I play crossover stuff — sometimes house remixes and some dubstep influence,” Bohn said. “In a certain way people in the States are still pretty new to the genre, also to the EDM genre, and it brings a lot of good opportunities to explore the boundaries of the genre.”
For those interested in learning more about the subgenre, Bohn has a podcast  called “WE R Hardstyle,” which features new music every month. In addition, Bohn recently did a documentary called Evolution of Style, which is available on his YouTube channel.
Bohn said that he has had great experiences performing in Los Angeles, so he is very much looking forward to playing at the Shrine on March 8.
“For me, the States is like a new era, a new journey, a new step, and I always love to go there, so I can’t wait!” Bohn said.
Tickets for “The Sound of Q-dance” are currently available online.

In his Feb. 28 op-ed in The New York Times, Greg Hampikian, a professor of biology and criminal justice at Boise State University, wrote satirically about the recent push in Idaho to allow students on public university campuses to arm themselves. One of the numerous relevant points Hampikian makes concerns the ability of armed individuals to designate certain offenses as “de facto capital crimes.” The proliferation of these kinds of capital “sentences” is one of the most unjust facets of increased gun ownership and use in the United States.
Irene Wang | Daily Trojan
 
The radical shift in the last few decades has been from duty to retreat laws, which require victims of assault to flee where possible, to expansive Stand Your Ground laws, which allow nearly unrestricted use of lethal force when defending oneself or one’s property. Look no further than the case of Trayvon Martin or the other 1,031 “justifiable” homicides from 2006 to 2010, according to the Violence Policy Center. Unfortunately, where the obligation had once been to use caution where possible and retreat without escalating the confrontation, now gun owners are allowed to arm themselves, becoming judge, jury and executioner in dispensing lethal force.
The problem with allowing college students — or anyone for that matter — to carry weapons to “protect” themselves is that it allows for people who are fearing for their lives to make split-second decisions that normally take years, if not decades, of debate and ruling in the current U.S. penal system. Whether or not individuals are in favor of the death penalty, it is undeniable that under the current justice system, the process through which an accused person would be arrested, tried, convicted, sentenced to death, have the decision appealed and then finally be executed by the state is a years-long process involving numerous lawyers and opportunities for appeal. Ideally, by the time a person convicted of a capital crime is executed, there should be no shred of doubt that that person is guilty. Of course, even now, groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Innocence Project argue that there can be no certainty in capital cases and such irreversible punishment is too harsh for a certainty-free legal system. These open-carry laws and Stand Your Ground defenses condense that entire legal system of safeguards, designed to protect American liberty, to a split-second decision made by people hyped up on fear and adrenaline.
Furthermore, these kinds of castle doctrine and Stand Your Ground laws allow for the use of lethal force for crimes that would not normally merit the death penalty under Idaho state law. Idaho allows for capital punishment in cases of first-degree murder with aggravating factors, aggravated kidnapping and perjury that causes the execution of an innocent person. The current castle doctrine in place in Idaho allows for the use of deadly force against home invaders. Home invasion does not warrant the death penalty under Idaho law — nor should it — but homeowners with guns are allowed to make that decision without giving due process to offenders.
Students for Concealed Carry wrote a response to the op-ed by Hampikian, which, besides missing the obviously satirical nature of the piece, also failed to address these key concerns. Published on March 3, the piece states that there need to be penalties harsher than expulsion from the university applicable to anyone who might attempt to assault students at the university.
“The fact that expulsion is the harshest penalty is precisely the problem,” wrote Kurt Mueller, the author of the piece. “Why on earth would a person intent on committing a crime of violence using a firearm or similar non-firearm based force care the least whit about the potential academic consequences?”
Mueller misses the obvious disincentives that the federal and state penal systems offer to discourage wanton violence on campus. Idaho is one of the states in which the death penalty is still legal, which is the harshest punishment available for offenders in the United States. Though Mueller would like students and faculty to take the death penalty into their own hands in miniscule time increments, other penalties would apply to anyone deranged enough to attack people in Idaho. Hampikian is simply referring to the harshest penalty under the university’s system of justice, which should be expulsion and not imprisonment or execution, and which should come from the actual Idaho penal system.
College students should not be given the ability to expand capital punishment, determine capital offenses or execute possible offenders without due process.

Why do these people keep equating the “Stand Your Ground” law and the Martin case? Zimmerman had nowhere to run with Trayvon on top of him, trying to bash his brains into the sidewalk. A lot of people poo-poo the story, but they weren’t there, were they?
The Virginia Tech shootings are another favorite argument. Just think, if just a few students were armed…isn’t there even a slight chance that the overall carnage could have been reduced?
How about Sandy Hook? If only the principal of that school had been armed, Lanza may have ended the attack by shooting himself as he did after the police arrived. Oh, and the principal would likely still be alive.
Regardless of the outcome of Idaho’s new law, the debate will go on. Facts will go up against lies (with the facts taking a beating because the lies are more intriguing), but you will never satisfy the Progressive population. Not, at least, until they come to realize that you might just be able to save their butts in a crisis.
that should be ever “register” Democrat, not vote Democrat, as I often do.
This article is nonsense.  I’m not a right winger.  I support gay marriage, separation of church and state, “Obamacare,” and even voted for Obama.  However, I refuse to ever vote Democrat because of the left’s irrational logic on gun issues.
If someone pulls a gun and starts shooting students, they always know they are in a gun free zone.  They know it is open season on their victims.  This is why the “gun free” cities like Chicago and D.C. have such a high gun murder rate… the criminals know they are the only ones with the guns, except for the cops which are 5-10 minutes away.
If someone is going to commit a crime with a gun, they should fear getting shot by their victims.   
As concealed carry has become more common over the past 3 decades, gun homicide rates have gone down almost 50%, except in “gun free zones/cities” where only the criminals have the guns.
If someone pulls a gun on my family are friends, they will get shot, in the head, instantly, and they will die, and the world will be a better place for it.
You refuse to “ever” vote Democrat? Umm, did you happen to notice what ticket Obama was running under?
P.S. Obama has shown irrational logic on gun issues for as long as he’s been in politics, so it’s nothing new for him.
Oh, I see my reply was too late. You don’t “register” Democrat but you vote Democrat. There’s a difference?
Remember that the authority of the police comes from the people. Each person in the USA has the right to defend their person and property. 
We allow the police to kill the mentally ill in Fullerton without trial. The officer only lost his job. If armed and armored police can kill because they think they are threatened by an unarmed homeless man, then ordinary people can carry guns for self defense.
The logic in the article has one very important flaw.  The criminal that attacks the good guy with a gun is the person that causes the event.  If you attack someone, you made the decision that you life is worth less than your crime.  So, lets put the blame on the criminal.  If the criminal does not want to be shot, and maybe killed, do not attack.  Is that so hard to understand?
Your arguement is invalid
If a girl walking home alone late at night is accosted by a gang of men intent on gang-raping her, would she have the right to shoot her attackers or does the author of this article think lethal force is not justified given the fact the attackers are not trying to kill her but “just” rape her? Also, does the girl first have to try and outrun her attackers first, thus turning her back on them and losing precious tactical advantage, or can she pull out her weapon and stand her ground and try to compel the attackers to disperse?
Well said Ras.
Everyone needs to remember that just because we carry, does not mean we must destroy life.
We can preserve life by preventing the crime in the first place and if in fact the moron perpetrating the crime is not deterred, we are not always forced to take head shots (or other vital organs intentionally).  With proper training and practice, you can disable your attackers and bring them to justice, while simultaneously preventing said rape or other violent personal crime.
Keep in mind:  guns don’t kill, careless or well trained people do; with or without guns.  The guns just level the playing field for those of us who might otherwise be victims.  So, stop treading on our personal freedoms and ability to not only feel safe; but to actually be safe.

On Feb. 24, hackers crashed and seemingly bankrupted Mt. Gox, the third largest Bitcoin exchange, sending prices rope-a-doping by $300/BTC. It’s time to look deeply at how the cybercurrency derives its value.
Among “alternative investments,” precious metals are the average Joes, rare art and microloans are the hipsters and Bitcoins are the awkwardly nerdy yet strangely cool new kids on the block. This trendiness can explain the fascination, but cannot justify the $500-1200 price tag. To warrant its lofty valuation, Bitcoin must complete its evolution from experimental curiosity to accepted currency, an achievement that would necessitate overturning societal conceptions of money entrenched by history. To be worth hundreds of dollars, Bitcoins must alter the world’s view of a dollar’s worth — a material feat for figments of cyber-ether.
Debate over monetary value once dichotomized monetary theory. The traditional, currently marginalized Real Bills Doctrine, or backing theory, believes money’s worth is derived from its issuer’s assets, while mainstream quantity theory holds that supply and demand determine monetary value. Though 19th-century bankers, as backing theorists, would balk if claims to ounces of gold were worth anything else than an ounce of gold each, quantity theory is Federal Reserve System Chairman Ben Bernanke’s guiding light. Despite this, typical Americans would likely be uneasy with the idea that the sizes of their nest-eggs depend indirectly upon their neighbors’ demand for dollars.
Even though we might conceptually dislike the idea that dollars in our pockets are worth a dollar each solely because someone will give us a dollar’s worth of something for them, an increasing number of us are willing to bet that Bitcoins are worth hundreds and will soon be worth hundreds more because someone will buy them from us at that higher price. Applied to asset bubbles, this logic is called the “greater fool” fallacy. This decade’s examples include the ill-fated tech companies and mortgage derivatives which enticed investors by possessing the exciting combination of being both uncertain and promising. With their unidentified inventor and freedom from regulation and oversight, Bitcoins have this exact combination of curio value and potential.
Though dollars are governmentally backed legal tender, precious metals are used in electronics and jewelry, and rare art has assumedly immutable cultural significance. Bitcoins, though fixed in supply, are nothing without their purported fiscal functionality.
Money is by definition an instrument to facilitate acquisition and sale. In money’s secondary purpose, however, being a store of value, paradox lies. Currencies must serve as stable bases to denominate value despite having little value without the presence of the things whose worth they denominate. A dollar’s worth of food must remain a relatively consistent quantity for dollars to be useful. Consequently, Bitcoin cannot be a conventional currency if it continues to fluctuate in value.
Perhaps conflation of this stability with true intrinsic worthiness leads people to view money as inherently valuable. Relatedly, a 1983 study found a 10-year period of inflation resulted in British citizens perceiving 10-year-old pound notes as physically larger than same-sized new ones. The degree to which our attempted logical assessment of money’s value is subject to subconscious irrationality invites the question of whether monetary value is actually objectively derived. Karl Marx proposed that money is entirely relational and subjective, writing,  “[Money] is now capital even as a mere thing … The movement through which this process has been mediated vanishes in its own result, leaving no trace behind.”
Marx believed abstract economic notions of monetary value are psychologically reified into object physicality, and that this psychological transformation occurs unbeknownst to us, “vanishing in its own result” and hiding from us the true source of this perceived value. Though Marx developed this concept into capitalism denouncing “commodity fetishism,” his ideas about money stand separate from his communist ideology.
Bitcoins take Marx’s psychological reification a step further. Rather than imbuing physical objects with abstractly derived value, BTC believers ascribe intrinsic worth to virtual 1’s and 0’s, assigning abstract value to an abstraction. Until Bitcoin, monies have all had links to the real, tangible world that served to imbue them with a measure of intrinsic value, at least in their users’ minds. Whether these physical underliers are of functional importance remains unclear.
If Bitcoins realize their purported transactional superiority, they can then test the importance of tangibility to the societal conception of value. Should they become a mainstream currency, Bitcoins, in lacking backing and government regulation, would free monetary value from institutional determination, transferring this power into the market’s invisible hands of collective judgment. Members of society would then jointly and absolutely control their currency’s value, a democratic notion Marx would likely approve of. Perhaps, however, the regulation of currency values is as essential as representative governance, and Bitcoins will prove as idealistic as pure democracy, their rise and fall standing as another example of the financial tyranny of the crowd that is a market bubble.

The saying goes that if you do something 21 times, it will become a habit. With that in mind, something this semester that has been more ingrained into my life as, embarrassingly enough, attending all of my classes. That was my New Year’s resolution and I’m happy to say that my goal to increase my class attendance has been reached — at least for now. Sometimes, however, to combat the dry spells of some lectures, I turn to a trusty agent: Buzzfeed.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
I was introduced to Buzzfeed just as social media started to become a really dominating force in my life. I was beginning to become a more active member of Facebook and even began tweeting. This is when I realized that to be an interesting social media contributor and avoid mundane updates, social media users relied on information-gathering websites. Though this didn’t completely eradicate the “eating a giant hamburger” or “walking my dog” statuses, it did add dimension to my Facebook and Twitter feeds. With Buzzfeed, I got to view “31 Very Important Pigs are Here to Melt Your Heart” and “21 Reasons Ryan Gosling And Rachel McAdams Need To Get Back Together.” Over time, I would visit Buzzfeed first thing in the morning, opening a multitude of tabs and drowning my browser in a sea of red ‘B’s. But now, it’s frightening to see how much I rely on Buzzfeed for the news I receive.
Before I venture into my inevitable critique of Buzzfeed, I should point out that there are many positive aspects of Buzzfeed. Unlike most news sites, Buzzfeed implements Facebook with each comment, thus holding people accountable for their input and encouraging more positive dialogue. This factor fosters Buzzfeed’s intellectual community. The site also offers quizzes that give insight to a person’s characteristics. I have discovered many dormant aspects of my life, ranging from what my greatest weaknesses are and, more importantly, which boy-band member is my soul mate -— Niall Horan from One Direction, in case you were wondering.
Possibly the most unique Buzzfeed feature is the way in which it presents its information in a condensed, picture-heavy format. This might be appealing for some, as people can stay socially conscious and feel educated while being informed in a time-efficient, visual way. And the innovators at Buzzfeed are constantly trying to figure out new ways to connect to people through trendy memes or nostalgic references. That way, people will find unfamiliar events more relatable.
On the other hand, I feel like this system contributes to the dissipation of traditional journalism. Maybe I’m being old-fashioned – — and a little biased — but I like the black-ink text deliverance of news. The details might not be what I ultimately remember about the current event, but they definitely help shape my opinions on the matter. I have to be the one to appropriate the event for myself, and I shouldn’t be swayed by a picture of a certain celebrity or woodland creature to think a certain way.
Additionally, a report with just the main points is a product of how we want to receive current events. When journalism is reduced to simplistic measures, it provides less space to get a point across and thus more room for generalizations and shortcuts, a phenomenon found by a study conducted by the Los Angeles Times. How information is presented will shape how people carry this information and use it.
Not all parts of Buzzfeed are inane takes on societal musings. There are some parts of the site that offer comprehensive, third-party reporting of events, such as what is currently happening in Ukraine and Venezuela. Follow-ups even include deep analysis of what happened.
Given the platform on which these pieces of information are transmitted, it’s hard to differentiate between what should be taken seriously sometimes. Serious information among a modge-podge of quizzes, best Jennifer Lawrence faces and Disney Channel throwbacks disrespect events with gravity. For example, I feel like the conditions of the Sochi Olympic hospitality were deplorable and a reflection of wealth disparity throughout the world. Buzzfeed reported the incidents, where the article did not receive as much traffic as the post about ’90s artifacts. Subsequent posts about the Sochi Olympics poked fun at the situation.
Maybe a follow-up to my New Year’s resolution to attend class more shall be to get less distracted by Buzzfeed. I know now that it is not a source for education but, rather, for entertainment. To my 32 Twitter followers and Facebook friends and non-friends, we’ll all still be able to ogle at cute puppies and kitties.

The reign is over: after three straight weeks as the number one movie, The Lego Movie has fallen to the third spot thanks to the strength of the two new releases: Non-Stop, the latest action thriller starring Liam Neeson, and Son of God, the cinematic edit of the record-breaking mini-series The Bible. The toy epic still managed a healthy $20.8M and has so far grossed $209.14M.
Opening at No. 1 was Non-Stop, which reunited Liam Neeson with Unknown director Jaume Collet-Serra and managed to earn $28.88M over the weekend. This is a marked improvement over Neeson’s previous action films, with most of them ranging from $19M (The Grey) to $21M (the previously mentioned Unknown). While it didn’t reach Taken 2’s opening ($49.5M), Non-Stop actually managed to open higher than the original Taken ($24.72M), although it’s not likely to share Taken’s incredible legs.
What drove this to a higher total was that the film had a compelling premise — a marshal trying to find a killer while trapped on an airline flight—that played to Neeson’s strength. It’s interesting to compare this to last week’s 3 Days To Kill: just having an interesting lead is not enough. You have to have an intriguing plot that’ll drive the film and ultimately the actor themselves. At this point, Neeson has established his own brand, evolving into a modern action star, and Non-Stop is his latest victory lap.
At the second spot was Son of God, culled from the mega-successful History Channel series The Bible, grossing $25.6M. Focusing specifically on the life of Jesus Christ, the producers of the mini-series, including reality television mogul Mark Burnett, wisely reached out directly to the Christian community and churches nationwide to market the film. They even released Spanish dubs in select theaters for Spanish-speaking audiences.
This is one reason why the majority of tickets opening day were through presales and group tickets, with many people going together with their respective faith-based groups to watch the feature.  All the more impressive when you consider that not only had these people likely seen the mini-series on television, but may have already owned it (The Bible did phenomenally well on the home market, being one the best selling Blu-Ray mini-series of all time).
While it was never expected to reach the levels of Passion of the Christ from a decade ago (the film had the perfect blend of controversy, coverage, celebrity intrigue, and market demand), the success of Son of God shows that the Christian market has been a mostly untapped audience. However, Biblical adaptations are a very sensitive issue, as any type of creative alteration can cause a fair bit of controversy, even being seen as sacrilegious.
Just earlier this week, Paramount announced that they plan to attach a disclaimer in front of Darren Aronofsky’s Noah, which comes out later this month, claiming that it’s an “interpretation” and not a “literal adaptation” to avoid offending anyone. It’s also possible that 20th Century Fox and Ridley Scott will have to do the same for Exodus, an adaptation of the story of Moses due December 12.
Son of God avoided this issue by taking a softball, non-offensive approach that was widely approved by the community prior to the feature release. It’ll be curious to see if Mark Burnett will succeed again with the sequel mini-series A.D.: Beyond the Bible, which will explore Revelations and the historical events that took place after the resurrection.

More than 160 years after his terrible ordeal, Solomon Northup is still making history. 12 Years A Slave, adapted from Northup’s harrowing account of being kidnapped and sold into slavery in the pre-Civil War South, won Best Picture last night at the 86th Academy Awards, beating out a slew of powerful contenders, including Gravity, American Hustle and The Wolf of Wall Street. Director Steve McQueen took the opportunity to dedicate the victory to all those who have experienced similar injustice, reminding his audience that slavery is still practiced in much of the world.
Feelin’ All Right · Matthew McConaughey won an Academy Award on Sunday for playing Ron Woodroof, a homophobic, HIV-positive electrician-turned-pharmaceutical smuggler in Dallas Buyers Club. Photo courtesy of Landon McDonald.
“Everyone deserves not just to survive, but to live,” McQueen said, harkening back to one of the film’s most resonant lines. “This is the most important legacy of Solomon Northup. This is for all the people who have endured slavery, and the 21 million people who still endure slavery today.”
Despite the intense speculation swirling around this year’s Oscars, Sunday’s ceremony was fairly conventional for the most part. From Best Actress Cate Blanchett’s well-deserved but inevitable win for Blue Jasmine to Gravity’s clean sweep of the major technical categories, the evening’s frontrunners went largely unchallenged. The show itself, hosted with amiable aplomb by Ellen DeGeneres, was an energetic but slapdash effort, full of unnecessarily long sketches and musical numbers that made it seem as if the comedienne and her fellow presenters were either belaboring the point or actively stalling for time.
There were bright spots of course, none more luminous than relative newcomer Lupita Nyong’o, who at some point during her charming, heartfelt acceptance speech transformed from talented ingénue into a bonafide movie star. The Yale School of Drama graduate, who won Best Supporting Actress for her heartbreaking turn as field slave Patsey in 12 Years A Slave, was clearly overwhelmed by the time she arrived in the pressroom for her post-win interview. When she did speak, however, she paid tribute to her tragic character and the millions of women in comparably hopeless situations.
“It doesn’t escape me for one moment that so much joy in my life is because of so much pain in someone else’s,” she said, her voice etched with emotion.
Another one of the night’s biggest winners was Alfonso Cuarón’s Gravity. The effects-laden thriller space-walked away with seven Oscars, including wins for Best Director (a historic first for a Latin-American filmmaker), Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Visual Effects, Best Original Score, Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing. The movie, a four-year labor of love by one of the most gifted visual storytellers in the medium, is the rarest of mainstream hits: a spectacle of substance whose pioneering visuals never once steal the focus from the film’s human characters, especially Sandra Bullock’s grieving, panic-stricken medical engineer. If it weren’t for the gale-force intensity of Blanchett’s Blue Jasmine performance, Bullock would have been a shoo-in for Best Actress.
Even though some of the night’s winners seemed almost preordained, there were plenty of surprises as well. Joshua Oppenheimer’s The Act of Killing, which asked former Indonesian death-squad leaders to recreate their crimes in the form of their favorite film genres, is one of the most sobering portraits of evil ever filmed, but it ultimately lost out to 20 Feet from Stardom, a bubbly crowd-pleaser based around the trials and travails of several generations of back-up singers.
The mawkish live-action short Helium defeated the star-studded pedigree of The Voorman Problem, while the throwback Mickey Mouse animated short Get a Horse was thrown from its saddle by the French-Luxembourgish import Mr. Hublot. And although Disney’s Frozen was considered a virtual lock to win in the Best Animated Feature race, a vocal contingent of Oscar analysts remained convinced that Hayao Miyazaki’s farewell masterpiece The Wind Rises would score a last-minute upset.
Then there was the night’s best underdog story. Dallas Buyers Club, an AIDS drama that had initially struggled to find an audience due to its grim subject matter, ended up becoming an awards season mainstay, ultimately receiving three Oscars: Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor and Best Makeup and Hairstyling (the budget for which consisted of about $250 for the entire 28-day production). Much of the film’s emotional impact can be placed on the skeletal shoulders of Matthew McConaughey and his portrayal of Ron Woodroof, a hard-living, homophobic electrician who turns to smuggling unapproved pharmaceuticals in order to help local AIDS patients get the medication they need in the wake of his own diagnosis. Best Supporting Actor winner Jared Leto also garnered accolades for his performance as Rayon, a transgender patient who helps Ron run his new business.
After his acceptance speech, Leto caused a minor uproar in the pressroom when he allowed members of the media to pass around his new golden friend.
“Does anyone want to try it out for size?” Leto asked, offering his statuette to the nearest journalist. “You can fondle it if you want to. Pass it around, but if you have the swine flu, please don’t touch. I bet this is the first time someone has given away their Oscar for an orgy in the press room!”
