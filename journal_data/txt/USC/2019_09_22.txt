Former USC football commit quarterback Bryce Young flipped his commitment to the University of Alabama Sunday afternoon. Only a day later, USC rebounded with a verbal commitment from quarterback Jake Garcia, a five-star prospect in the 2021 class.
Young, a five-star recruit, the No. 1 dual-threat quarterback and the No. 32 overall player in the class of 2020 according to 247Sports, previously committed to USC in July 2018. Garcia announced his commitment after releasing his top 10 schools only two months ago. 
“I’d like to say a huge thank you to [USC head] coach [Clay] Helton, [offensive coordinator] [Graham] Harrell, [wide receiver] coach [Keary] Colbert, [and] the rest of the USC staff for the opportunity that they have given me,” Young said on Twitter. “I would also like to thank the USC fans and community for all the support. I will always have love for the University of Southern California and wish for nothing but the best for its players, coaching staff and fans.”
Young’s decision comes as the future outlook of the USC quarterback situation has grown increasingly murky. After sophomore JT Daniels’ season-ending knee injury in USC’s season opener, Kedon Slovis has impressed as a true freshman. If he keeps performing well, there figures to be another competition for the starting quarterback role next year. Slovis, however, missed most of USC’s 30-23 victory over Utah Friday after taking a hard hit on the second play from scrimmage.
With the two current Trojans each making a case to be USC’s starting signal-caller next year, there figured to be at least one odd man out with Young’s impending arrival. Now, that seems to be Young. 
With Alabama junior quarterback and Heisman candidate Tua Tagovailoa likely departing for the NFL after the season, the door is open for Young to compete for the starting role as a freshman with the Crimson Tide. 
“There were no promises given, and I know I have to compete, but I’m coming in with the mindset of competing for playing time right away,” Young said. “I’m going to work my hardest and give myself every opportunity when I get there.”
Young was set to continue establishing Mater Dei as a quarterback pipeline to USC, as Daniels, Matt Barkley and Matt Leinart all came out of the elite Santa Ana program to play quarterback for the Trojans. 
That legacy — and USC’s promising 2020 recruiting class — took a hit with the news of Young’s flip. 
“This was definitely one of the toughest decisions I’ve ever had to make,” Young said. “USC didn’t do anything wrong, and I love the staff there … This was never about USC not meeting my expectations or anything, it was more about me feeling Alabama was too good of an opportunity to pass up … I have total peace about it right now and I’m really excited about the incredible opportunity. I’m grateful for it and I’m going to be ready to go.”
USC will face off against Alabama in Dallas, Texas, to begin the 2020 regular season. 
Fortunately for the Trojans, the sting of Young’s decommitment did not last long. 
According to 247Sports, Garcia ranks as the No. 4 pro-style quarterback in the 2021 class and the No. 14 prospect overall.
During his sophomore season last year, the 6-foot-1, 188-pound pocket-passer threw for 2,130 yards and 15 touchdowns over nine games after transferring from Long Beach Poly to Narbonne High School — a perennial powerhouse in Los Angeles. Through five games this season, the junior has already thrown for 1,300 yards and 14 touchdowns.
Garcia leads an offense at Narbonne similar to that of Harrell’s Air Raid at USC. Before USC’s season began, Garcia admitted he was apprehensive about the Trojans’ offense. However, after seeing both Slovis and redshirt junior Matt Fink enjoy immediate success upon stepping in, Garcia ultimately decided that the opportunity to play in Harrell’s Air Raid was one he could not pass up. 
“I was excited when they hired Harrell, and I knew they were going to put up numbers,” Garcia said. “I just didn’t know how well it was going to fit me. But after seeing what they have done so far, and I ended up going to the game at Stanford, it’s pretty much similar to the offense we run at Narbonne. I feel like I’ll be a really good fit.”
Garcia committed to USC over offers from Alabama, Auburn, Florida, Georgia and LSU, among others. 
Many USC fans were dismayed after Young’s decommitment dropped USC’s 2020 recruiting class from an already underwhelming No. 42 to No. 62 nationally. Historically, the Trojans’ recruiting classes have regularly been ranked among the nation’s elite, and USC’s recent downward trend in recruiting has given many fans cause for concern.
After Garcia’s commitment, USC’s 2021 recruiting class ranks No. 6 nationally. Trojan fans uncertain about the program’s future may finally find a moment to exhale — but Garcia says the work is far from done. 
“I’m about to start recruiting,” Garcia said. “We are going to get a lot of guys. A lot of good guys, a lot of top-tier guys to Southern California.”

Last fall, I wrote one of my first columns about Vine, the iconic six-second looping video app that was laid to rest in 2017. At the time, Vine’s now-historic videos were still widely circulating on Twitter, where they were almost memorialized for their impact on modern-day internet culture. From how users employ sound effects, punch lines and fast-paced editing, the app was foundational in shaping a new wave of how content was produced, and many of its former creators have since gone on to establish wide-reaching YouTube fame (David Dobrik, Cody Ko, Dolan Twins, and more.). 
Clearly, Vine was such an ingrained staple of the digital sphere that absolutely nothing could dethrone it, right?
Well, it’s amazing what can change in two years’ time. What were once-laughed at Vine references have now started to feel like dated jokes, all thanks to the rise of a little app called TikTok. (OK, not so little anymore).
TikTok’s explosion crept up on me with almost no warning. Earlier this year, though a few of my peers in Reach, a social media club on campus, hopped on the app’s hype early, I still was hesitant to buy into it. While my friends climbed the ladder of TikTok success, I still refused to download it and create an account because I felt it was another fleeting trend that would die down soon enough and wasn’t worth my time. Then came the summer, when, upon some giving in and independent exploration, I one day fell deep into the rabbit hole of the app’s “For You” page. After hours and hours of scrolling, I unashamedly will say I’ve been hooked ever since.
Still, I often have to remind myself of the platform’s legitimacy because, truth be told, there’s a slight generational gap between my age group and that of the predominant TikTok user. The app is swarmed with everything Gen-Z and, though I identify within that group, I do acknowledge that I’m on the older end of them.
After inundating myself with TikTok culture for a couple months, my time at VidCon (as I wrote about in my most recent column) erased any remaining doubts I had about its significance in the online world. In the past, VidCon has been thought of as a celebration of creators and fans mainly in the YouTube space, but from the moment I stepped into the Anaheim Convention Center, it was clear TikTok was taking the week by storm. In almost every direction I looked, there were groups of kids filming every viral TikTok trend imaginable, so it’s no surprise the TikTok party was one of the biggest and most out of control events of the week (I missed out, unfortunately).
But, if you are like I was and are still questioning whether TikTok is worth paying attention to, maybe the app’s more than 1.2 billion global downloads will be a convincing enough statistic (not to mention that it’s surpassed the popularity of YouTube, too).
How did the app get so popular seemingly out of nowhere? Well, it turns out its growth is not as out of the blue as it appears. The app is a product of the major Chinese internet company ByteDance, who acquired the app Musical.ly (oh yes, you remember the one) in 2017 for $1 billion. The two were originally kept as separate platforms before Musical.ly was merged into TikTok in August 2018, bringing over all of its creators and fans, too. What was once the joke of the internet, much like Vine, has quickly become its new darling, as many already-popular creators on other platforms (again, David Dobrik) have also jumped on the app to expand their reach.
Of course, I can’t end an analysis of TikTok without bringing up how it has birthed so many of today’s internet subcultures like e-boys and VSCO girls (who, truthfully are just 2019’s MagCon boys and Tumblr girls). Oh yes, don’t even get me started on how journalism internet culture has also capitalized on TikTok — looking at you, Washington Post.
Though Vine has by no means been completely thrown off its high horse, slowly but surely the Vine references have gotten replaced by TikTok ones and tweet threads of Vines have turned into TikTok ones. Vine will forever hold a special place in our hearts but, for now, TikTok is the future of internet culture that we must face. So, to my fellow older Gen-Z peers who still say, “I don’t get TikTok,” it’s time to start scrolling.

“The stories of women — particularly from other countries — are not so often told,” said Dana Wilsey, chief operations officer of The 49% Film Festival. “And many people have no idea what’s happening around the world, so we want to bring [these stories] to them in a way that they can see. We want them to see themselves in these women on the screen.”
The 49%, founded by Paula Kweskin, is a female-led media company that seeks to use storytelling to advocate for global change — where Kweskin and her company are those agents of social change. 
Kweskin, an award-winning documentary filmmaker, writer and human rights attorney, created The 49% to utilize the power of media to create the change she wanted to see. 
Last week, The 49% hosted a film festival at the School of Cinematic Arts’ Ray Stark Family Theater, where it showcased a collection of documentaries and short films from around the world. This included the U.S. premiere of “The Daughter Tree,” a documentary about exploring the cultural aftershocks of the preference for baby boys in India, and “Giving Birth in America,” a documentary series examining maternal mortality in the U.S. The short films also shed light on the critical but often-forgotten stories of child brides, domestic abuse and arranged marriage. 
“[Film] is universal,” said Neena Nejad, a documentary filmmaker, producer and director who attended the festival. “When you watch a film, it stays with you — the images and stories stay with you, from childhood on.” 
Nejad, who directed “The Price of Honor,” a documentary about the honor killings of two American girls, has witnessed the impact her films have had in providing women a voice.
“When I did my film, people had no idea what honor violence was and the things that fall under the umbrella of honor violence, like child marriages, female genital mutilation [and] honor killings,” Nejad said. “People had no clue what those were … or that they were happening now and in the states. So for me, the biggest thing is to bring awareness and say: Hey, this is happening even now, and this is happening here. You can’t just brush it under the rug … and say it’s not an American issue.” 
Alessandro Ago, director of programming and special projects for the School of Cinematic Arts, explained the importance of hosting The 49% at USC.
“We try and highlight as many different voices as possible, both as a reflection of our student body and also because there’s so much amazing work that comes from so many different experiences that it benefits us to have a very diverse lineup,” Ago said. 
Ago worked with Wilsey and Kweskin on the Censored Women’s Film Festival, their first collaboration with USC Cinematic Arts, in 2017. With this event, Ago had seen the effects of helping to showcase their work at USC, and hoped to find similar success through their 49% festival this year. 
“To me, success is that these stories were heard and watched, no matter by whom — whether it’s by a student or the general public,” Ago said. “It’s less important to have a large audience than to have one that is impacted and potentially mobilized by the stories they’re experiencing. Everyone’s experience of these films will be different and have different effects in their lives.” 
The stories told at the 49% Film Festival this past week are a living testament to the power of storytelling. 
“There’s only so much you can do with speaking, but film gets to the heart,” said Soraya Deen, a women’s rights activist. “There is no sequence. You can come from all sides and deliver a story. Film sends the message very gently, but also forcefully.” 
Deen is the president of the Interfaith Solidarity Network and founder of the Muslim Women’s Speakers Movement. Through this year’s festival, she hopes that audiences are able to better empathize with and share in the hardships of the women on screen and find the motivation to make change themselves.  
“When we share these stories, two things can happen,” Deen said. “First, it empowers another person to tell their story. Two, it also gives you a reason to not be quiet anymore.”
The power of storytelling is often taken for granted in western culture, but the 49% Film Festival reminds us of the importance of having your story told. By showcasing the experiences of the voiceless, the festival is designed so that audiences will not just grow in their awareness of issues but become inspired to tell and promote other unheard stories. 
“If someone feels inspired to tell their own story, if someone feels inspired to learn more about a topic, that’s all great,” Ago said. “But I think just having exposed the campus and anyone that chose to come from the L.A. public to these films is sort of a reward in and of itself.”

Fall 2019 class registration has come to an end, but the stress and deliberation on course planning continues unabated. 
As USC strives to revitalize its reputation in academic quality, it is necessary to examine students’ learning experience. The way students engage in academic learning lays the foundation of the educational environment. To boost academic excellence, the University should refine the class registration system and offer students more course  information.
It is common for college students to feel anxious during course registration. Many classes, especially entry-level core and general education courses, fill up instantly, and the alternatives may not fit one’s needs. Students might not find the classes that work for their schedules familiar or interesting. With access to more course information, students would be better equipped to  assemble feasible class schedules.
In fact, class scheduling is a pressing issue nationwide. A report on higher education scheduling by Ad Astra Information Systems revealed that only 30% of classes in four-year private schools effectively meet the students’ demands. The data speaks to more than just class enrollments. Some classes are overloaded because they appeared easy to students at first glance. 
If more information, such as work requirements and research opportunities, is disseminated, students may reconsider course-related decisions. Effective class scheduling is vital for satisfactory academic performance and reducing the time to graduate. Therefore, the consequences of inadequate understanding or incentives for the class can be detrimental to students’ levels of performance and academic progressions.
USC’s web registration page also presents a few problems since it presents very limited descriptions. This short description is straightforward yet problematic. For many required courses, especially the upper-levels, succinct descriptions are inadequate for students to fathom the course objectives, which only adds to the stress of registering. 
Syllabuses sometimes do live online, but students are forced to find them on another website, and sometimes they are not posted until classes start or are never posted at all. Though students can look for external resources, such as asking others who have taken the class before or emailing the professors directly, the information they obtain should be readily attainable, preferably through the web registration system. 
Simply put, USC should maximize the efficiency of class scheduling and give more official and objective course information on the web registration site so that students can refer to before clicking the “Add to myCourseBin” button.
Admittedly, class scheduling is a very complicated process, especially in USC where student dynamics are exceptionally diverse and interdisciplinary education is encouraged. However, the more complex and ambiguous the class scheduling is, the more essential it becomes for students to fully understand the courses. Without adequate and meaningful information, it is hard for students to produce rational and beneficial class schedules. As college students, we are expected to be responsible for our own academic schedule. Nonetheless, the University’s endeavors to improve the class registration system should be equally and simultaneously called upon. By improving its class registration system, USC opens a new perspective to embrace and corroborate academic excellence, helping its students become more independent and critical decision-makers.

Some retailers in USC Village shuttered quietly — SOKFY and Cafe Barilla did not receive the business they expected and closed their doors without many taking notice. But BBCM and Rance’s Chicago Pizza have made their closures known — they are currently engaged in a lawsuit against the University for promissory fraud, misrepresentation and breach of contract. As USC Village continues to change with these new vacancies, students and community members need to engage and speak up on inclusivity and affordability issues and share their thoughts on which retailers and restaurants should be part of USC Village. 
I’ve written about how USC Village’s construction, from solely an architectural and design standpoint, lacks inclusivity. Construction projects take a long time to complete, especially one with so many stakeholders to consider, so it is unlikely much will change on this front. But another aspect of community inclusivity lies in the retail, restaurants and services that are available.
After the completion of USC Village, many community members voiced their concerns about the sheer lack of affordability of all vendors in the area. The Daily Trojan even ran an editorial board commenting on the “unaffordability of USC Village’s establishments” and that USC was “shortsighted to not have inexpensive options at USC Village, or to at least allow students to use their dining or discretionary dollars.”
Part of the problem that contributed to this backlash was a lack of proactivity before USC Village was constructed. While students only live at USC for a short period of their lives, student concerns have been similar throughout the years: accessibility, affordability and inclusivity. Students needed to show up and speak up back in 2005 when USC Village was first being planned. Since we can’t rewrite the past, students need to get involved now and voice the concerns that they have about what USC Village lacks or fails to do.
While USC Village was under construction, all of the master plans were available to the public. USC Village’s appearance was public knowledge, which renders the lawsuit’s claim of the University misrepresenting USC Village’s Dining Hall as questionable. According to Laurie Stone, associate senior vice president of USC’s Real Estate and Asset Management, in the years leading up to USC Village’s construction, there were numerous occasions for community and city government input.
“We had … over 100 community meetings between 2005 and 2012,” Stone said. “Throughout this process, hundreds of longtime community residents and supporters attended many public hearings to voice their support. During the final unanimous city council vote, over 1,000 community residents attended.”
At some point, the University should host another community meeting about USC Village, for updates and concerns. But until then, students and community members can send REAM a message about which vendors they hope to see in USC Village or complaints and concerns they have had during the past two years USC Village has been standing. USC Village’s website has a contact form, linked at the bottom of the page — not the most readily apparent forum, but it does exist.
While the outcome of Rance’s and BBCM’s lawsuit is still to be determined, students and community members have an opportunity to have a say in what retailers they wish to replace these restaurants, or what USC should keep in mind when selecting vendors now and in the future. A contact form may not seem to be the most potent way to share concerns, but REAM does keep students’ concerns at the front of their considerations.
According to Stone, before USC Village was constructed, “two student surveys were completed as part of the selection process, and additional input was received from community members and city representatives during the entitlement process. We selected tenants with that input and feedback in mind.”
Though there isn’t a survey this time around, that doesn’t mean students shouldn’t be involved. Under a new president, there is ample opportunity to begin discussion. President Carol Folt has been receptive to students’ input on a number of issues, and USC Village’s affordability and inclusivity should be a topic on the table.
The University should also meet students halfway. Another forum or community meeting, or even a survey, could be a constructive step to ensuring the community the USC Village serves is included in the conversation. Whether by contact form, direct email or student-led initiatives, it’s never too late to speak up about development that affects our community.

Some came dressed in their best tailgating attire, others had their children with them, and a few even brought chairs to sit on. As ’70s classics like Earth, Wind & Fire’s “September” and the Bee Gees’ “Stayin’ Alive” blasted through a small set of speakers and groups of protesters began to form, organizers realized that this rally — held in solidarity with the millions of young people striking for the climate worldwide — was going to be big.
More than 200 USC students attended the rally in front of Tommy Trojan, carrying signs that read, “Don’t Be A Fossil Fool,” “We Took Hot Girl Summer Too Far” and “Did You Buy The Planet Dinner Before You Fucked It?” 
Organized by the Environmental Student Assembly, Undergraduate Student Government and Environmental Core, the event was not the first environmental action to take place on USC’s campus. But it was, by far, the most attended.
“Last year, when we had a similar kind of event, there were about 30 people here,” said School of Cinematic Arts professor Jeremy Kagan, who spoke at the rally. “Obviously our student body is taking it seriously, and we all have to take it seriously because it’s the world we live in.”
Standing on the base of a lamppost a few feet from Tommy Trojan, speakers discussed the importance of political involvement and individual action in the face of climate change. Although the speakers’ megaphone didn’t carry sound much farther than the first few rows of people, audience members cheered enthusiastically under the hot afternoon sun. 
In a speech at the beginning of the rally, ESA Co-President Nathaniel Hyman spoke about the steps individuals can take to change a political system he said does not accurately represent its constituents’ needs. While voting and striking is important, he said, that it is not enough to enact change.  
“The tables are stacked against us at the institutional level,” Hyman told the crowd. “Find a campaign that supports our message and join them … We have to be forcing ourselves into every room where decisions are made.” 
Senior Tianna Shaw-Wakeman, the event’s lead organizer, said in an interview that the protest’s main focus was to push for global action from local and federal governments. She said the strike’s two primary goals are reducing greenhouse gas emissions worldwide and ensuring equity and justice for marginalized communities as the transition to clean energy takes place. 
Historically, USC has lagged behind other institutions in terms of its sustainability efforts. In its 2030 Sustainability Strategy, prepared in 2016, the Academic Senate found that USC’s last recorded sustainability score of 36% was 24% lower than the median of its peer institutions. After USC released the August update to its 2020 Sustainability Plan, student leaders cited unclear messaging and lack of initiative as roadblocks to the plan’s success.
Shaw-Wakeman said she hopes the strike signaled the need for a new era in sustainability on USC’s campus. Friday morning’s inauguration was “zero waste,” and Folt has listed sustainability as one of her priorities as president. 
Folt announced Tuesday that USC will reintroduce and improve upon a previously discontinued public transit subsidy program, something multiple attendees cited as a step toward building a more sustainable campus. 
At the rally, Folt spoke briefly about the importance of environmental action before the crowd erupted into a rhythmic chant of “Ca-rol, Ca-rol, Ca-rol” as she made her way back into the audience.  
“I feel in a way I’ve spent my entire professional life just dreaming that I’d ever see crowds of people like this,” Folt told the protesters. “I wish we hadn’t failed to get it done well before this, but if everybody starts working, the time is right now.”
SCA professor Margaret Moser, who described herself as an environmental activist of 20 years, said she wished the protesters had made more specific requests, like turning off the fountains on campus and adding additional bike racks. Nevertheless, she said, the event made her excited for the future of environmental activism on campus.
“I think the youth have a moral authority that is persuasive to a broader audience,” Moser said. “This very conscious embrace of hope and joy and music is … welcoming in a way that environmental activism wasn’t for a long time.”

To consistently win football games, the most important thing to do is to win upfront. No matter what people say about flashy position players, the best college and pro teams throughout history have dictated the line of scrimmage and dominated the point of attack.
But there are rare occasions that a skill position group dominates so thoroughly that it overshadows a team’s lack of physicality and subpar coaching. That was the case with USC’s wide receiving corps in its 30-23 victory over No. 10 Utah Friday night.
USC’s prospects weren’t good entering the game. Utah was undefeated, destroyed a BYU team that beat the Trojans in Week 3 and displayed more of the physicality and discipline that helped them embarrass USC 41-28 last season. Things only got worse when freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis departed the game after taking a hard hit on the second play from scrimmage. Redshirt junior Matt Fink, who entered the season as the third-stringer, was suddenly thrown into the spotlight against the conference’s best defense.
USC was down two quarterbacks, had -7 rushing yards for the game at one point in the fourth quarter and lost the time of possession battle by nearly 18 minutes. How did USC put up 30 points and win this game? The answer is that USC’s three starting wide receivers were perhaps among the top five players in the game.
We have to start with senior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr., who had a career-high 10 receptions for 232 yards. In a game that featured its fair share of jaw-dropping plays, Pittman’s 77-yard touchdown catch in the third quarter was arguably the most impressive, giving USC a 21-10 advantage. Pittman went up high to haul in the slightly underthrown pass, then held off senior defensive back Tareke Lewis while running 30 yards to the end zone. It was an absolute tour de force.
Pittman has showcased all the abilities that make him the best player on one of college football’s best receiving units. His NFL draft stock is rising after posting 19 receptions for 327 yards and three touchdowns in the last two games. Pittman’s route-running is more crisp than in previous years, demonstrated by his ability to gain consistent separation against Utah.
However, the most incredible part was that he physically dominated a Utah defensive backfield that features two potential All-American selections in junior cornerback Jaylon Johnson and senior safety Julian Blackmon. USC’s game plan at many times throughout the night seemed to be to throw the ball up and let Pittman go get it.
“At times we threw it into double coverage, up to [Pittman] twice actually, and he came down with it,” offensive coordinator Graham Harrell said after the game. “That’s just having a special guy.”
USC’s other top wideouts deserve credit too, even if their contributions weren’t as flashy as Pittman’s. After being held to one reception for 4 yards against BYU, sophomore Amon-Ra St. Brown caught three passes for 32 yards on the game’s opening drive. He then beat two defenders for a 31-yard score on another underthrown jump ball on the Trojans’ second drive.
Redshirt junior Tyler Vaughns beat Johnson down the right sideline for a 29-yard touchdown on USC’s first possession, helping the Trojans to a necessary fast start. He also made an impact at the end of the game, drawing a pass interference penalty on Johnson that set up redshirt freshman running back Markese Stepp’s 4-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter.
The receivers were so good that Utah had to change its approach early in the game, switching out of man-to-man coverage because it couldn’t match up with USC’s playmakers.
“We’ve got wide receivers that are one of the most special groups I’ve ever seen,” Harrell said. “If they ever get one-on-one opportunities, they’re going to go win them.”
The receivers didn’t win the game single-handedly. Fink impressed with several fantastic downfield throws, particularly a 42-yard bomb to Pittman on third down that set the Trojans up for their final touchdown. 
Utah’s offense left a lot of points on the table due to penalties and mistakes, and the USC defense made big plays when it needed to. Freshman defensive end Drake Jackson pressured Utah senior quarterback Tyler Huntley in the end zone in the fourth quarter, forcing an intentional grounding and safety.
But the receivers played the biggest role in the Trojans’ victory. Much of Fink’s yardage came from the receivers beating Utah’s defensive backs to jump balls, a fair amount of which came in double coverage. Everyone knew USC’s receiving corps entered the season as the team’s best position group, but few anticipated they would be the biggest factor in a win over a team as good as Utah. 
“I could show you [Pittman’s] stats right now,” Fink said. “The guy’s a monster, you can’t guard him. And that goes with [St. Brown], it goes with [Vaughns], it goes with [freshman]Drake [London]. We’re stacked all across the board and, with weapons like that, you can’t do anything about it.”
Things won’t get easier for the Trojans as they head to Seattle this week to face No. 17 Washington, who defeated BYU at home 45-19 this past weekend. Washington has a recent history of fielding dominant defenses with elite defensive backs and that hasn’t changed this season. With multiple potential all-conference selections in the secondary, the Huskies’ defensive backfield presents a challenge for these receivers. If the Utah game is any indication, though, it’s a test they can pass with flying colors.

After a weekend tournament that left the No. 5 USC men’s water polo team with a 3-1 record, the Trojans delivered a decisive 13-6 win over No. 9 Long Beach State University in their home opener last Thursday. 
The victory signaled a massive improvement in defensive execution after a jolting loss to No. 2 UC Santa Barbara. 
A string of fouls, turnovers and missed shots contributed to a sloppy first quarter that saw the lead change hands many times. USC carried a one-score lead into the second quarter, but quickly pulled away with 3 goals before the half to turn the tide heavily in its favor. 
Junior driver Jacob Mercep began the scoring run early in the second quarter, sinking a shot in the top left corner of the cage on a 6-on-5. Three more exclusions passed with no goals from either team until senior driver Marin Dasic charged in on a power-play. 
After redshirt junior driver Luke Wyatt tallied another Trojan goal, the 49ers had gone over 12 minutes without a score, and the Trojans had taken over. 
USC junior goalie Vaios Vlahotasios picked up seven saves in the first half to keep LBSU in check.
With nine exclusions already shared between the teams at the halftime break, head coach Marko Pintaric talked about making the most of every power-play opportunity the Trojans had.
“The guys were definitely more patient than in the Santa Barbara game,” Pintaric said. “That extra pause they were making made all the difference in the world.”
LBSU finally returned from the dead with scores from junior attacker Nemanja Bakic and sophomore center Theodoros Pateros, but as was the theme all game, USC simply had more firepower on offense. Mercep, sophomore driver Hannes Daube, sophomore utility Alexander Lansill and redshirt junior utility Luke Karaman each tallied goals for the Trojans to take a 6-goal lead into the final quarter. 
Early on in the fourth, it was clear that the Trojans had found their rhythm and would not allow LBSU back into the game. Mercep scored his fifth goal of the evening a little over a minute into the period and strong blocking on Long Beach State’s power-plays prevented the 49ers from scoring until three minutes later, when Bakic managed to get another one through. 
Karaman powered a strike just past the hands of Long Beach State junior goalie Marwan Darwish after a quick pass from Daube, and the latter picked up another goal with two and a half minutes to go. Although the 49ers were able to manage one more point from Bakic just as time ran out, it was too little too late as the Trojans were well on their way to a 13-6 victory.
Vlahotasios, who played all four periods and amassed 10 saves, was satisfied with the difference that USC made in honing in on their defense after allowing 13 goals to UCSB just four days earlier. 
“I think our win today was not because of our offense, it was because we were playing for one another,” Vlahotasios said. “We were playing for our teammates, our brothers, and we got the stops on defense, and it put us in a position to score goals. We had two or three practices to prepare for this game. You know, we [stayed] after practice voluntarily and did extra work on Long Beach’s tendencies, and I think the result was pretty good for us.”
The Trojans will travel to UCLA this weekend for four games in three days at the 2019 Mountain Pacific Invitational.
