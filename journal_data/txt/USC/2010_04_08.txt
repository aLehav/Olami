The No. 3 USC men’s tennis team has an opportunity to clinch a share of the Pac-10 title this weekend, but it continues to strive for a more significant objective — to defend its national title.
Attack mode · Junior Jaak Poldma and the Trojans will have a chance to clinch a share of the Pac-10 title with two victories this weekend. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans (18-2, 4-0) will travel to Tucson, Ariz., to face No. 35 Arizona (11-8, 1-3) today.
“This is a big match for us,” said USC coach Peter Smith. “It gives us a chance to share the [Pac-10] title, which is not our goal, but it is still a milestone match for us.”
All season long, the Trojans’ efforts have been geared toward winning the NCAA crown.
“It would be nice to win the Pac-10, but the NCAA championship is the goal,” said senior Jason McNaughton.
The Trojans remain the only undefeated team in Pac-10 conference play and control their own destiny in winning their first conference title since 2008 — when USC was awarded the Pac-10 championship after UCLA forfeited two matches because the Bruins included an ineligible player in their lineup.
The team’s mind-set remains steady as the players prepare for the final two conference matches.
“Everyone is focused. We have a great opportunity ahead of us,” McNaughton said of a potential Pac-10 title.“We need to stay focused, not look ahead to UCLA [on April 16].”
Arizona has lost to Stanford, California and Washington by scores of 6-1 and is coming off a victory over Oregon 5-2.
The Wildcats have two ranked players in No. 90 Andres Arango and No. 115 Andres Carrasco.
The Trojans have won the previous five meetings between the schools, including a 7-0 sweep last season at Marks Stadium.
Injuries remain relevant as sophomore Matt Kecki continues to nurse a shoulder injury and will not make the trip this weekend.
The team hopes he will be able to compete against No. 10 UCLA to conclude the season.
USC has seemingly controlled the Pac-10 Player of the Week honors throughout the season.
McNaughton became the latest recipient of the award and the fourth Trojan honored in this manner.
“It’s a nice achievement to have, but it’s more of a team achievement,” McNaughton said. “Everyone really pushes and supports one another during practice and matches.”
In addition to the Pac-10 award, senior Robert Farah was awarded by the USC athletic department during the fifth annual Tommy Athletic Awards this week.
Farah was co-honored as the Male Athlete of the Year for his performance during the 2009 national championship season.
Wide receiver Damian Williams shared the award with Farah.
After a successful start to the conference season, USC seems to be hitting its stride right as the season winds to its conclusion.
“We have five or six guys in good form, and our doubles is looking good,” Smith said.“We are happy to be in this position.”

After holding leads late in its last two events but failing to win, the No. 8 USC men’s golf team hopes to seal the deal this weekend and claim its first tournament title of the year at the Stanford U.S. Intercollegiate in Palo Alto, Calif.
The Trojans built a four-stroke lead last week at the ASU Thunderbird Invitational but went a combined nine over par on the last three holes and slipped to third place.
USC coach Chris Zambri said he wasn’t overly concerned about his team’s inability to finish.
“If you’re in the game, that’s a great thing. We’ve been in the middle of it for the last two or three events we’ve played,” Zambri said. “We are getting better, and I do think it is the kind of group that can finish.”
The Trojans have finished in the top three in their last three events. In its first five events of the season, USC finished no higher than tied for fourth.
“It’s a great thing that we’re giving ourselves opportunities to win,” junior Matt Giles said. “I feel as though the more opportunities we get, the better all of us will get at [finishing].”
With their recent good form, the Trojans have climbed nine spots in the national rankings in the last month and will enter this weekend’s tournament as one of the favorites to win.
Host No. 3 Stanford, Thunderbird Invitational champion No. 5 Washington and crosstown rival No. 7 UCLA pose the biggest threats to USC’s championship hopes.
Zambri will make one change to his lineup from the squad he sent out last week in the desert, inserting redshirt junior Bo DeHuff for freshman Stewart Hagestad in the five spot. Hagestad will still compete as an individual.
DeHuff turned in his top finish of the spring competing as an individual last week, tying for 42nd.
Giles, a two-time All-American, seemed to rediscover his top form last week, posting his first top-five finish of the season.
“Everything’s much better,” Giles said. “There wasn’t any one thing that stood out before. Everything was pretty poor to be perfectly honest. Now I feel really confident with my short game especially.”
Sophomore Steve Lim led the field by two strokes last week after two rounds, shooting 68-65. He struggled in the final round, however, posting a 75 and falling into a tie for eighth.
“It’s not easy to be in that position, leading by two,” Zambri said. “Steve’s won tournaments before but he hasn’t won in college so it was new for him. I think he’ll learn from the experience and be better off for it.”
Freshman T.J. Vogel continued his solid play last week, finishing in a tie for 22nd. Vogel finished in second place overall at the two previous stroke-play events.
For freshman Martin Trainer, this week’s tournament marks a homecoming. Trainer is from Palo Alto and has played the Stanford Golf Course more than 50 times in his career.
“I know the course really well, and that gives me a big advantage,” Trainer said. “I’m really excited. If you know your way around, you can definitely shoot a good score there.”
The Stanford U.S. Intercollegiate, which begins Sunday and ends with the final round on Tuesday, is the last event for USC before the team returns to Karsten Golf Course in Tempe, Ariz., for the Pac-10 championships at the end of the month.
“I think everyone is identifying on an individual basis where they can improve their games and working hard on that,” Giles said. “With the last couple of events being really close calls that we probably should have won — that gives us some hunger and motivation in going forward.”

After a solid performance at last weekend’s Texas Relays, the USC track and field team will send a limited contingent of runners to the Pomona-Pitzer Invitational this Saturday in Claremont, Calif.
“We will have quite a few athletes competing,” USC coach Ron Allice said. “But it all really depends on who we think needs to race and who needs to rest.”
The athletes not attending the Pomona-Pitzer meet will train through the week and get ready for next weekend’s Mount SAC Relays, one of the more high-profile meets on the Trojans’ schedule. Allice declined to say if he would hold some of his stronger runners back from competing in order to rest for next weekend.
“I really don’t like to say [who will be competing] because I do have some of my first-liners competing there,” Allice said. “I’d rather not categorize. For me to draw a line in the sand for a difference between this athlete and that athlete, that could be misconstrued.”
The entries posted on the Pomona-Pitzer athletic website appear to suggest a compromise between resting USC’s top competitors and maintaining a strong team that should have a good showing on Saturday. While standouts like senior men’s sprinter Ahmad Rashad, junior men’s hurdler Oscar Spurlock and junior women’s distance runner Zsofia Erdelyi are notably absent, USC does possess the No. 1 seeds in both the men’s 110- and 400-meter hurdles in junior Brendan Ames and sophomore Duane Walker, respectively.
“I’m trying to elevate some people from one category to another,” Allice said of the athletes he is sending to Claremont. “These are people I think can get a better qualifying standard and have better standing in more important meets down the road.”
Even with all the shuffling around, Allice says the team remains united and focused on both this weekend and the more important meets that lie ahead.
“We’re doing what we need to do to continue to have this team develop to where we would like it to be during the championship part of the season,” Allice said. “That’s the focus and will remain the focus.”

After six consecutive home games, the No. 1 USC women’s water polo team will leave the friendly confines of McDonald’s Swim Stadium and head east to Tempe, Ariz., for a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation matchup against No. 9 Arizona State.
Inspired · USC coach Jovan Vavic has seen his Women of Troy squad hold productive offenses off the scoreboard like those of the Sun Devils.  - Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan 
USC’s (17-1, 3-0) battle-tested defense face an Arizona State (15-10, 0-5) squad that has at times looked like an offensive juggernaut. The Sun Devils are ranked third in the MPSF in goals per game at 11.08, narrowly trailing Stanford and USC.
Additionally, Arizona State features two of the league’s top goal scorers in attacker Lynlee Smith and center Shannon Haas. Both are presently ranked in the top 10 for goals scored with 45 and 38, respectively, making the ASU attack even more potent.
But even with the Sun Devils’ offensive aptitude, the Women of Troy, which have won 15 consecutive games, is more than capable of stopping the dynamic duo. Currently, the team’s defense is ranked second in the conference, allowing just 4.83 goals per game, and in the past 10 games has not yielded more than six goals to the opposition.
“We’ve become more defensively oriented now,” said USC coach Jovan Vavic. “The girls are actually starting to think about defense.”
There is no question the Women of Troy defense has been able to stifle some of the toughest teams in the nation, USC’s offense might be even more dangerous.
“We can score goals too,” Vavic said. “That’s nothing new.”
And scored goals they have.
The Women of Troy are ranked first in the conference in scoring with 12.78 goals per game — a clear indication of the team’s balanced scoring attack. Five players, including senior two-meter Kami Craig, rank within the MPSF’s top-20 goal scorers — more than any other team in the conference.
“I just think, game by game, the team has really been growing overall,” Craig said. “It’s a total team effort in how you play. Offensively, we’re equally balanced. A lot of girls can get points on the board, and, in the end, it’s cool having so many girls up on the scoreboard.”
That philosophy will serve the Women of Troy well as they take to the road just one week before the scheduled crosstown grudge match with heated rival UCLA at home.

With four games left in the regular season, the No. 6 USC men’s volleyball team has finally found its form.
The Trojans have won three straight games, and the streak couldn’t have come at a better time. 
“We can’t control much ahead or behind us. We just want to keep winning and be on a roll going into the playoffs,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “Last year, [when we went to the national championship], we lost four of six heading into the playoffs so Lord knows what we can do when we’re winning.”
USC only needs one win in its last four games to clinch a spot in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament, and the Trojans (13-9, 10-8) hope that win comes this weekend at Pacific (8-18, 0-18) on Friday or at No. 1 Stanford (16-5, 13-5) Saturday.
The Trojans are coming off a sweep of No. 7 UCLA and a hard-fought, five-set victory of defending national champion UC Irvine. They are looking to carry that momentum into this weekend, when they face the No. 1 team in the country.
“Against UCLA, that’s the best we’ve played all year, and we gotta keep that going against Stanford and Pacific,” sophomore outside hitter Tony Ciarelli said. “Pacific always plays us tough, but if we play like that against Stanford, it’s going to be a really good game.”
Though Pacific hasn’t won an MPSF game this year, it isn’t a team USC is over-looking. The Trojans beat Pacific a month ago and have defeated them eight straight times, but they were down 2-0 and became the only team to go to five sets against the Tigers earlier this season.
“That’s pretty good motivation for us,” Ciarelli said. “We should come out strong against them because we know after last time that they can come out and play with every team in this league.”
Although USC is hoping to get past Pacific and secure a playoff spot, the match of the weekend is the one against No. 1 Stanford.
The Trojans lost to the Cardinal at home in February, but this is a different USC team from the one that was in the middle of a slump.
“I’ve played Stanford four times since I’ve been here and I’ve lost to them once,” Ciarelli said. “It’s not like they’re superheroes. They’re No. 1 just like UCI was when we beat them in the playoffs last year. There’s no pressure on us. If they lose, they don’t host MPSF; if we lose, then we’re 10-9.”
Ferguson has largely reverted back to the lineup that helped USC off to a 6-1 start with one exception: Freshman Maddison McKibbin has replaced sophomore Andrew Pizula as the libero. Ferguson finalized this lineup a few weeks ago, and he says the addition of McKibbin is a big reason for the Trojans’ three-game winning streak.
“The lineup change gives us a ton of confidence,” Ferguson said. “Maddison brings a lot to the table that won’t show up on the stat sheet. He’s got a real good way about him and plays well with all the guys on the floor. So there’s a chemistry thing there, too.”

Heading into its fifth practice of the spring, it appears as if the USC offense is starting to catch up to the defense.
After finishing with a disappointing six turnovers during Tuesday’s workout, the Trojans totaled just two turnovers over Thursday’s two-and-a-half-hour-long practice.
High steppers · Redshirt sophomore running back Curtis McNeal and the USC offense have begun to get in sync during spring practices. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
“I thought the offense responded well today after getting beat up in our last practice,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin. “We had six turnovers the other day so I was really pleased with how the offense came out. They really came out physical and got out on the defense for most of the day.”
Despite several injuries on the offensive line, the unit looked more than physical, holding its own against a deeper, healthier defensive line featuring plenty of potential preseason All-Americans.
In turn, the running game was able to benefit from its strong play, as senior Allen Bradford and junior Marc Tyler took off on several runs of at least 10 yards where they continued to total yardage even after first contact.
Not only was the offense more physical, but also more precise in numerous aspects of the game because of similar schemes that Kiffin shares with former head coach Pete Carroll.
“We’ve gone back to what the terminology used to be years ago,” Kiffin said. “So there’s a little bit of recall for some of the guys.”
—
Coincidently, one of those players who has been able to pick up the offense quickly has been sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley, who started as a true freshman last season.
“[Barkley], who was around the program before he got here, has some recall as well,” Kiffin said.
Barkley, in addition to senior Mitch Mustain, looked far more comfortable with the playbook and was certainly in sync with the receivers, even on some of the deeper routes. Barkley, in particular, connected with wideouts Brice Butler and Robbie Boyer on deep passes nearly fifty yards long.
“I think today was evident that I’m more comfortable out there just because I have the experience,” said Barkley, who finished the afternoon with zero interceptions. “The system is the same system. I just feel more comfortable in myself, growing from last year and progressing from what I was”
But it wasn’t all fun and games for Barkley and the rest of the offense on Thursday, as it faced constant pressure from a stifling defensive line. On multiple occasions, either Barkley or Mustain was faced with little time to throw and, as a result, was forced to throw the ball away or dump the ball off to a running back.
“They’ve shown they can already be a good Pac-10 defensive line, said defensive coordinator Ed Orgeron. “I think that Armond Armstead has really good talent. I like Jurrell Casey’s movement. I like Nick [Perry] a lot. I think Christian Tupou is awfully tough too.”
Pressuring quarterbacks will be a major focus for the defense this season, as Orgeron’s national championship defenses with USC in 2003 and 2004 were well-known for their high sack totals. And right now, the front four appears ahead of schedule
“They’re a lot better than when I originally first started working with them in the agility drills,” added Orgeron. “I think they’ve had an excellent spring so far. I think we can be a little better than what I thought first.”

Somewhere in the middle of Ricky Oropesa’s freshman season at USC, it became clear he was going to be a star.
Now, halfway through his sophomore year, it’s apparent he’s going to be even better. Maybe even one of the best to ever play here.
Gaining that status will be a tall order, given the rich history of USC baseball. The 12 national titles and  countless major league players it’s easy to get lost in the record books.
But Oropesa continues to play like he belongs in that company.
The sophomore hit another home run Wednesday night, his 10th of the season. And it wasn’t just a meaningless tack-on run.
No, Wednesday night’s solo shot was a two-out, bottom-of-the-eighth, eventual game-winning home run.
It was much like the one he hit on Feb. 21 against Cal Poly, when he led off the top of the ninth with a tie-breaking homer and spurred USC to a five-run inning.
And much like the one on  March 7 against New Mexico, a two-run homer in the first inning that gave the Trojans a lead they never relinquished.
See where is this going? He’s capable of changing the course of a ballgame with one swing of the bat.
He isn’t just racking up incredible numbers — he’s winning games.
But those numbers can’t be ignored — they’re jaw-dropping.
Wednesday’s home run was the 23rd of his short USC career. He hit 13 last season along with the 10 he’s already hit in 2010.
With each titanic blast deep into the Southern California night, he’s inching closer to historic territory. Barely a season and a half into his career, he’s in prime position to crack USC’s all-time top 10.
Of course, anything can happen. Slumps happen. Injuries happen. Opponents will pitch around him even more.
He could hit another 10 home runs this year. He could hit zero.
But with his talent and his power, the possibility of the former is far greater than that of the latter.
And if he keeps it up as a junior, who knows where he can go?
Getting to the top of the all-time list is no easy task. But if he can do it, he’ll join an elite group of players.
Geoff Jenkins is third with 45 career home runs. Jeff Clement is second with 46. Oropesa was still in grade school when they hit balls out of Dedeaux Field.
And Mark McGwire is the most prolific power hitter in USC history. His 54 career homers are the most ever.
He hit his last one before Oropesa was even born.
At this rate, it’s possible. Oropesa could eventually become the greatest home run hitter in USC history.
Still, his home runs tell just one part of the story.
He’s hitting .348 and showing patience at the plate, to the tune of a .424 on-base percentage.
This after he batted .314 last year and showed he can be a disciplined hitter.
This year he has 12 more extra-base hits and 30 RBI, and he’s tied for the team lead in stolen bases.
He has committed just one error all year.
As a midseason sophomore, Oropesa is proving that he is the complete package.
He’s not just a big bat in the middle of the lineup. He’s someone who can get on base, get in scoring position and get runners in.
And can hit the big fly when he needs to.
When Oropesa comes to the plate, the Trojans can count on him to deliver more often than not.
He’s that kind of player.
And when he leaves for the pros, it’s possible he’ll be the kind of player Trojans in future generations talk about and look up to.

The USC baseball team looks to win its first Pac-10 series of the season this weekend as it hosts No. 30 California at Dedeaux Field beginning tonight at 6:30 p.m.
Minor slump · Junior infielder Joe De Pinto is one for his last eight and was held without a hit in USC’s loss to Cal State Bakersfield on Wednesday. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans (15-14, 2-4) defeated CSU Bakersfield Wednesday behind a strong effort from the bullpen and a tie-breaking solo blast off the bat of sophomore first baseman Ricky Oropesa in the bottom of the eighth, giving USC a 4-3 victory.
Cal (17-10, 3-3), has been riding a five-game win streak heading into the contest. Most recently, the Golden Bears defeated then-No. 18 Arizona over the weekend and also beat their rival No. 22 Stanford on Monday, 2-0.
The Trojans most likely will turn to senior Kevin Couture (2-0, 5.66 ERA) to start the series. In his outing last Friday against Oregon State, Couture pitched five innings, giving up one run on five hits and striking out seven. He took a no-decision in the Trojans’ 4-1 loss.
Following Couture in the weekend rotation will be sophomore right-handers Ben Mount (3-1, 3.28 ERA) and Andrew Triggs (1-4, 4.11 ERA).
The Golden Bears will hand the ball to right-hander Erik Johnson (4-1, 2.70 ERA) Friday. Johnson, who has racked up 32 strikeouts in 33 and one-third innings, has set the tone for the Golden Bears’ rotation so far this season. Following Johnson will be left-hander Justin Jones (6-2, 3.07 ERA), who has two complete games this season, and right-hander Dixon Anderson (2-1, 3.38 ERA).
Cal is hitting .327 as a team with a staff ERA of 4.07 compared to USC’s team batting average of .287 and 4.51 staff ERA.
Trojan pitchers will have to look out for Cal catcher Chadd Krist, who is batting .406 on the season and leads the Pac-10 with 12 doubles. He also has a .713 slugging percentage and five home runs on the season. The Golden Bears’ All-Pac-10 first baseman Mark Canha also poses a threat to the Trojans. He is hitting .380 with a team-best 31 RBI.
USC has some firepower of its own on the offensive side. Oropesa hit his 10th home run of the season Wednesday night, leading the Pac-10. The sophomore is hitting a team-best .348 and has driven in a team-high 30 runs.
Sophomore left fielder Matt Foat also provides a big bat for the Trojans. He is hitting .321 on the season with five home runs and 27 RBI.
After Friday’s contest, the series will resume Saturday at 1:30 p.m. before concluding Sunday afternoon at 1 p.m. USC leads the all-time series against the Golden Bears, 224-130-2, and has won five of the last six meetings at Dedeaux Field.

The USC women’s tennis team returns home this weekend to host a pair of Pac-10 rivals at Marks Stadium.
The No. 17 Women of Troy (11-7, 3-1) face off against No. 21 Arizona State (12-3, 4-1) first in a match today and then host No. 56 Arizona (12-6, 1-4) on Saturday.
Second shot · Freshman Valeria Pulido and the Women of Troy lost a close battle with Arizona State 4-3 earlier this season. The Sun Devils come to Marks Stadium on Friday with Pac-10 positioning at stake. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy return to Los Angeles after a long weekend in the Bay Area, where rain stopped the Women of Troy from completing their match against then-No. 12 Stanford. With forecasted rain, the teams played singles first but rain postponed the doubles play with the singles tied 3-3. The deciding doubles point will be resumed only in the event that it becomes a determining factor in the 2010 Pac-10 title. USC lost to the then-No. 11 Cal 5-2 that weekend.
“This past weekend we played two of the best teams in the country, and both times we were extremely close to winning. This showed our potential while also giving us confidence by realizing how good we can be,” freshman Valeria Pulido said.
In the individual rankings released March 30, junior Maria Sanchez moved up in the singles ranks from No. 3 to No. 2. Sanchez holds a 15-2 singles record in dual-match play.
No. 26 sophomore Alison Ramos for USC saw her ranking come in just outside the nation’s top 25. She is followed closely by Women of Troy freshmen No. 30 Danielle Lao and No. 103 Pulido. In doubles, Lao and Sanchez hold the No. 46 ranking after their first week playing together, while junior Lyndsay Kinstler and Sanchez are ranked No. 62 and Pulido and Sanchez rank No. 63.
Meanwhile, ASU is fresh off an upset victory over California.
Even though USC is 42-20 all-time against ASU, the Sun Devils will bring some tough conference competition for the Women of Troy today.
ASU’s Nadia Abdala was named ASU’s Female Athlete of the Week after her performance against Cal, in which she captured a victory over Cal’s Kasia Siwosz. Abdala’s win allowed ASU to clinch the match and complete the upset. In addition, ASU has No. 80 Kelcy McKenna ranked in singles, but no ranked doubles duos.
USC played ASU last month in Tempe, Ariz., over spring break. Although USC lost 4-3 to the Sun Devils, the match was not a conference-counting match and therefore did not count toward either team’s Pac-10 record.
“By playing ASU again, and now at home, we feel that is our chance to really show ourselves,” Pulido said.
But these matches this weekend are conference matches, and if USC wants a chance at the Pac-10 title, it will need to win both. In addition, if USC wins, it will be able to host the first two rounds of the NCAA tournament; and considering its record this season is 8-3 at home, that would be very beneficial to them.
“Although we are no longer undefeated in the Pac-10 conference, it is still vital we bring our best to every match,” said Lao. “Of course we have to somewhat rely on the rest of the conference to not be undefeated; we still have to concentrate on what we can do if that does happen in order to give us the best shot and opportunity at the title.”
Today’s match against ASU will start at 1:30 p.m., while the match on Saturday against Arizona will begin at noon.

All of those times students have felt stressed or overwhelmed have just been validated — the Daily Beast recently ranked USC the 18th most stressful college in the country.
Stanford University topped the list of the 50 most stressful schools, followed by Columbia University and MIT.
In determining which colleges caused the most stress in students’ lives, the Daily Beast evaluated and examined the cost, competiveness, acceptance rate, the school’s engineering program and crime on campus at the top 50 universities in the U.S. News & World Report. Colleges were then ranked based on the cumulative findings.
The survey states that USC’s total cost exceeds $50,641 and its acceptance rate is 21.9 percent. The university ranked 26 out of 50 for “competitive academics,” 7 out of 50 in its engineering program, and 23 out of 50 in its crime rate.
At least we have the 9-0.  I’ll be there tonight and tomorrow night.  Let’s party – especially the seniors.

The violin is one of the last instruments you might associate with Jimi Hendrix, but for USC junior Antonio Pontarelli, the two go hand in hand.
Pontarelli, a business administration major, is a renowned violinist who is not only skilled in playing in the instrument’s traditionally classical style but also in the newer genre of rock ‘n’ roll.
String sensation · For his Springfest set, student violinist Antonio Pontarelli will be covering artists such as Jimi Hendrix and Bill Withers. - Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan 
At age 3, most kids can’t even color inside the lines let alone learn an instrument. Yet, it was at this age that Pontarelli picked up his first violin.
Fast-forward 16 years and not only is Pontarelli still playing but he has also built himself an impressive résumé that includes singing and songwriting.
In fall of 2003, Pontarelli was the grand champion of NBC’s America’s Most Talented Kid and since then has performed at venues such as the Hollywood Bowl and the Greek Theatre. He has performed alongside artists such as Jethro Tull, Earth, Wind & Fire, Seal, Jason Mraz and Brian McKnight. His manager, David Sonenberg, also manages the Black Eyed Peas.
On top of these musical accomplishments, Pontarelli graduated high school early and began his education at USC at only 16 years old. He is currently studying entrepreneurship, which he hopes will help him establish his career in business.
His family has a deep appreciation for music, which inspired him to learn to play so early on in his life. His father always played rock music around the house, so that was what he was exposed to most growing up.
He enjoys covering rock artists since he can complement the original work with his own brand of uniqueness.
“Whenever I do covers, I try to change them and make it more into my own,” he said. “It’s always nice to experiment with songs people have already done.”
In addition to his father’s rock ‘n’ roll influence, Pontarelli’s grandfather also served as an inspiration to the budding violinist.
“My grandfather was a famous accordionist in Germany,” Pontarelli said. “He played in World War II and went around to the pubs so he didn’t have to fight.”
Pontarelli loves the spontaneity within his grandfather’s music and believes it’s a trait all good artists should acquire.
“Improvise on the fly and make music for the moment that you are in,” Pontarelli said. “That is what being an artist is all about.”
Pontarelli’s grandfather also taught him that music is meant to be shared.
“The people who have really been successful have always tried to connect with the audience and connect with the listener’s souls,” Pontarelli said. “That’s the goal of the songwriter, and that is my goal.”
Another goal of Pontarelli’s is to use his music to make the world a better place. He recognizes the far-reaching capabilities of song and is a firm believer in its powers.
“We can only understand the world and our life through our senses, and music is one of those things we can relate to our lives through,” Pontarelli said.
He has seen firsthand the impact that music can have in bringing groups of people together. In 2009 he performed at the Jakarta International Java Jazz Festival in Indonesia. The audience included people from all races, religions and walks of life to sit and enjoy the music.
“Music brings people together,” Pontarelli said.
In addition to wanting to use his talent to draw people together through music, Pontarelli is also invested in spurring further artistic pursuits.
“I really feel strongly about the music I write,” he said. “I wanted to be able to share my music with as many people as possible and generate more interest in the arts.”
Wow! I just got back from seeing Antonio Pontarelli’s show with the USC drumline finale. It was truly the highlight of the day! We’ve gotta bring them back next year!
Is Antonio’s performance on Youtube yet?  I can’t wait to see it.
Impressive…Antonio Pontarelli was the violinist on Serj Tankian’s (System of the Down) CD “Empty Walls”.
Antonio! Finally he is playing at USC. You gotta see this dude play!  I have seen one of his shows and he is waaaay tight on the violin! Check him out @ 4:30pm Saturday you won’t be sorry.
Great article! We are excited that some of the incredible talent at USC is being showcased at the Springfest! Let’s show our USC loyalty and support our artists guys! 
Antonio Pontarelli is playing at 4:30.

Date Night
Steve Carell, Tina Fey, Mark Wahlberg, Kristen Wiig and James Franco are only a few of the names that compose a preposterously talented and entertaining cast. Carell and Fey play the Fosters, a couple whose stagnant relationship is turned on its head by a date that does not go as planned.
The Square
The twists and turns of this neo-noir thriller begin when an adulterous couple attempts to commit larceny. The film’s writers and directors, the Edgerton brothers, have drawn comparisons to the Coen brothers in their Fargo-esque interpretation of small-town criminals.
After.Life
A young woman (Christina Ricci) wakes up in a funeral home and is told by the undertaker (Liam Neeson) that she is dead. What follows promises to be a dark, twisted and claustrophobic tale that should leave viewers guessing until the last second.
—A.J. Serrano

Writer-director Christopher Nolan has been very busy since the release of his blockbuster The Dark Knight two years ago — so busy in fact that most haven’t a clue as to what his next project, Inception, is actually about.
Even the film’s trailer, which was released online a few months ago, does little to unravel the secrecy surrounding the upcoming film. All it does is present images and brief snippets of dialogue that, regardless of the confusion, look truly stunning.
It appears as though the mystery connected to the film is a good thing — the less the public knows about the film going into it, the better the movie-watching experience will be when it opens in July.
There are a handful of films that come out every year that simply need to be ignored until their release date, and Inception is definitely one of them. This process changes the whole experience of seeing a film tremendously, ultimately allowing the film to actually surprise its audience members and feed off of their intensity to propel the overall momentum of both the film and audience reaction. As thrilling as this kind of an experience is, it is something usually absent from most film premieres.
Films are easily ruined, and a lot of the time it happens before most viewers have set foot in theaters.
First off, there are trailers, and although they often serve their purpose of simply previewing an upcoming film, they just as frequently give away far too much information.
Then there is the Internet, a novelty when compared to trailers, which — as an archive of innumerable images, videos and the endearing efforts of bloggers and fanboys — certainly does not foster the maintenance of the element of surprise, at least when it comes to popular upcoming films.
All of the information you could ever want is simply a mouse click away, waiting to expose every possible aspect of upcoming films.
For instance, the plot and most of the characters of Iron Man 2 are easily accessible online. This information is not only available in the film’s trailer, which seems to give away almost everything, but also in endless debates as well as informed assumptions and opinions written by people across the planet. Granted, the film’s source material comes from the Marvel comic book series and, thus, much of the information has been in existence for some time, but not every film derives from such recognizable source material.
How different would it have been to watch The Matrix not knowing anything about it or never seeing a single frame of the film in a trailer? Those who did see the trailer were already aware of the “bullet-time” time sequences — in which the action progresses in slow motion, allowing the camera to pan around the entire sequence — beforehand, and ultimately the visual effects had less of an impact.
Witnessing effects such as these for the first time without any prior knowledge is an incredibly different experience than seeing many of the film’s classic scenes out of context. But the problem with a film like The Matrix, and its inability to stay secretive, stems from its distributor’s marketing campaign and the film’s resulting hype.
Studios live off marketing strategies to sell their films, but in the process, marketing campaigns eventually end up spoiling a lot of the film’s plot. This can also be said about James Cameron’s latest epic, Avatar, which is already a movie-watching experience unlike any other. But how different would it have been if people had been exposed to less when the first trailers were released?
As it stands now, Inception is still quite an enigma, and that is largely because of the fact that Nolan and his production team have worked feverishly to keep their film a secret, preserving a great deal of the film’s integrity as well as the overall movie-watching experience.
Along with its vague trailer, some of the only other legitimate information regarding the film’s plot was revealed in an April 4 article in the Los Angeles Times, but the article only devotes two sentences to plot summary and even that is ambiguous.
Even though July is still a long way off, hopefully most of the film and its contents will remain as secretive as they have for the past two years.
Overall, it is very hard for film enthusiasts to remain uninvolved when it comes to information regarding upcoming films, especially those that look as promising as Inception does because, as exciting and appealing as discovering absolutely everything about a particular film is, the occasional instance of experiencing a movie without any prior knowledge can be enormously rewarding.

After a monthlong break, the No. 4 USC women’s golf team finishes its regular season this weekend at the PING/ASU Invitational at the Karsten Golf Club in Tempe, Ariz.
The tournament is the last chance for the Women of Troy to gain momentum heading into the playoffs. The team has had a very inconsistent invitational season, winning three tournaments and finishing out of the top 10 in two others.
This week, the team will send four All-Americans to Tempe to capture a fourth title.
Sophomore Jennifer Song leads the team, fresh off her recent 21st place finish at the LPGA Kraft Nabisco Championship. Song was the highest finishing amateur at the event, one of the four majors on the professional tour.
“I had a lot of fun there, but I was struggling with my shots, especially in the third round,” Song said. “I was disappointed in my finish because I know I can do better.”
Despite that disappointment, she feels she has gained confidence heading back into her final few amateur events. The No. 2 golfer in the country has two individual wins and two additional top-10 finishes in five tournaments in her sophomore season. Song, an All-American as a freshman, was recently named one of the 14 finalists for the Sullivan Award, given annually to the top amateur athlete in the country.
Two-time All-American junior Lizette Salas is seeking her second individual victory this season in Tempe. Salas enters the tournament ranked 15th in the country and has three top-five finishes in six tournaments this season, highlighted by her first place finish at the Turtle Bay Collegiate Invitational last November.
Three-time All-American senior Belen Mozo is coming off her first top-10 finish of the season at the Bruin Wave Invitational a month ago. Mozo struggled through the fall with an injury, but has gotten progressively healthier throughout the year.
As her health has improved, so has her placement. Mozo enters her final regular season event as the Women of Troy’s career leader in rounds under 70, leading teammate Song by one.
All-American senior Stephanie Endstrasser has struggled during the season with inconsistent play and is hoping to return to form in time for the postseason. Rounding out the Women of Troy this week is freshman Cyna Rodriguez. She had her best finish as a Trojan at the Bruin Wave, where she tied for 15th.
The last time the Women of Troy won their final regular season event, they went on a winning streak that ended with a victory at the 2008 national championship tournament. The team hopes to capture similar momentum this weekend.
“We want another championship on our belt,” Song said.

The opening scene of When You’re Strange: A Film About the Doors shows a wrecked car sitting at the bottom of an embankment near an empty desert highway.
Lizard King · When You’re Strange: A Film About the Doors uses archival footage with narration to tell the story of the ’60s rock band.  - Photo courtesy of Rhino Media 
A bearded Jim Morrison emerges unscathed from the pile of mangled metal and broken glass, stares into the sky and nonchalantly walks toward the two lanes above. Though caked in the dreamy gloss of original 35mm film, the shots look surprisingly modern, crisp and realistic — almost too much so.
Because the infamous Doors front man died nearly 40 years ago and the wandering hitchhiker images are a near-perfect accompaniment to the tortured poet’s tale, the audience is forced to question exactly whose piercing grey-blue eyes and cherubic cheekbones it is looking at.
“When this confusion started happening, we tried to ignore it,” said Tom DiCillo, the documentary’s writer and director, of the obscure Morrison footage. “We considered putting a disclaimer at the beginning, but then decided to just trust that when people see it, they will know they’re seeing the real deal.”
The footage — actually taken from Morrison’s 1969 self-financed experimental film HWY: An American Pastoral — is only a small portion of available-online-but-never-before-compiled images that DiCillo and the three still-living Doors members used for When You’re Strange, the first feature-length documentary to tell the real story of the Doors.
Unlike many of its contemporaries, such as the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, the Doors’ filmography is relatively sparse. Immortalized in print through band member and groupie biographies, the story of Los Angeles’ first rockstars — and more specifically that of its erratic lead singer — has only been given the Hollywood treatment once before, in Oliver Stone’s 1991 biopic The Doors.
But while Val Kilmer played Morrison as a self-destructive egomaniac, When You’re Strange tells a more informed tale of a sensitive poet grappling with the temptations of fame and alcohol. It also gives the other band members their well overdue credit and places the Doors’ genre-defining sound within its late ’60s’ social and historical context.
“You get to see the ingredients in the melting pot,” drummer John Densmore said. “And you get to see Jim with a little bit of humor. Val did a great job — he should have won an Oscar — but to see the arc of the young Jim and then the tragedy as in Tom’s film, is more well-rounded.”
The film goes to great lengths to pinpoint moments in Morrison’s transformation, reiterating that he was a poet, not a singer, noting that for the first few shows he performed with his back to the audience as if he were at band practice.
Morrison’s magnetism permeates the film, and seeing him in motion offstage — as opposed to in the iconic stills that are most closely associated with the artist — provides an entirely new view of the singer. Morrison’s mellow demeanor and impish grins give realistic insight to the man who, despite a troubled soul, hypnotized a nation.
By mentioning but not stressing Morrison’s drinking binges, the film also eliminates any question of resentment from the remaining band members.
“Whatever you have to go through to get to the art, that’s the only thing that matters,” organist Ray Manzarek said. “We had a tough time with Jim during the latter part of his short life on the planet, but I wouldn’t trade it for anything. He always came through. You just learn to live with the eccentricities of a poet.”
Rejecting the traditional rock-doc template of live footage interspersed with the reminisces of retired talking heads, DiCillo took input from those affiliated with the band and wrote his own informative narrative script.
Read in the final version of the film by unlikely Doors fan Johnny Depp, it floats over rare images and personal clips, telling the story of the Doors from when Morrison and Manzarek met as film students at UCLA through Morrison’s untimely death of heart failure in a Paris apartment.
“Johnny did a great job,“ Manzarek said. “He’s got that subtle understated quality about him that lends itself perfectly to narrating this whole Doors story. It’s not sensational, and it’s very decisive.”
In addition to the scenes from HWY, DiCillo used clips from the band’s 1969 concert film and also delved into the previously unpublished works of Paul Ferrera, Morrison and Manzarek’s old film school friend who spent time with the band on tour.
“We were used to them hanging around,” Densmore said, “and they had cameras, so it worked out. It was better than having something official.”
Ferrera’s footage was crucial to the creation of When You’re Strange because without his backstage perspectives of Morrison and the rest of the Doors, the film might not have been as successful in setting them apart from other bands attempting to use their music to speak to the socio-political issues of the time.
“In all the footage, there is never a shot of anyone — except for Jim once or twice — mugging for the camera,” DiCillo said. “Nobody mugs for the camera, and that gives you a sense of how intimate it was.”
Even though the archival scenes that comprise the documentary have been available since before Morrison’s death, it wasn’t until the band’s manager, Jeff Jampol, made a push to create something more significant that When You’re Strange came together.
“It’s not just about the footage, but it’s also the interpretation,“ Manzarek said. “It’s Dick Wolf and Tom DiCillo putting it all together into a cohesive form telling the story of the Doors.”
Despite the decades between the band’s heyday and the release of its first documentary, today’s uncertain political climate serves as an appropriate backdrop for a Doors resurgence. While its organ-infused borderline-psychedelic rock was a soundtrack to the late ’60s counterculture, our modern image-consumed society could learn a lot from the band’s philosophy.
“I think what the Doors represent is the antithesis of what is going on today,” DiCillo said. “There isn’t any sense of looking within. The entire right-wing agenda is about blindness. The Doors music says, ‘Listen in and open your eyes.’”
This is fabulous!

For students facing final exams, projects and the stress of moving out at the end of the semester, subletting their apartment can be the last thing they want to worry about.
Trading spaces · For students who live off campus, finding people to take over the summer months of their 12-month leases can be a long and complicated process. - Andrew Chi | Daily Trojan 
But for many students, subleasing is a necessity. Students looking for alternatives to USC housing generally lease apartments through one of the many off-campus housing companies  in the North University Park area. Many of these companies only offer 12-month leases, so students who leave for the summer are forced to either sublease or continue paying rent, even though they are not using their apartment.
Students looking to sublease apartments tend to rely on the Internet to connect with potential renters. Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist and Uloop tend to be the most popular websites to post listings.
“I had a lot of luck with Facebook Marketplace, but not so much with Craigslist,” said Iris Fung, a senior majoring in international relations. “With Craigslist, there are a lot of spammers. It’s less specific to USC subletting. Facebook is more targeted to college students. Students use it a lot, so the marketplace is a natural place to look.”
Some students, however, think there should be a more streamlined process for finding people to sublet an apartment, given that a large number of students are looking to sublease every summer.
“I only know of Facebook Marketplace and Uloop. I looked at other websites, but I didn’t post a listing because I didn’t trust my information to be on them,” said Eileen O’Donnell, a senior majoring in theatre.
The various housing companies around campus each have their own policies regarding the length of a lease or student sublease.
First Choice Housing, formerly Cal Student Housing, offers students leases that range from nine to 12 months, according to a representative from the company’s leasing office. The length of the lease depends on factors such as when an apartment becomes available and how soon a student wants to move in.
Vaasu Swaminathan, a senior majoring in aerospace engineering, signed a 10-month lease with Cal Student Housing last school year.
“[The 10-month lease] was set at a slightly higher rate than a 12-month lease,” Swaminathan said. “But I didn’t have to look for someone to sublease over the summer because it ended the day after graduation.”
Stephanie Camacho, office manager of STUHO Student Housing, said that, although the company only offers yearlong leases from August to July, they are not against students subleasing their rooms. The company provides students with two different options.
Tenants can choose an assignment, which involves terminating the current tenant’s lease and transferring the entire lease to a new tenant. The new tenant would be required to complete STUHO’s entire application process and be approved by the landlord.
Alternatively, a student can choose to sublease, temporarily allowing someone to live in his room while he is away and take over rent payment. In this situation, the current tenant is still considered responsible for payment and any problems that could arise with the person filling their spot.
“We usually encourage that if it is someone you don’t know, you do an assignment,” Camacho said. “That way, you aren’t responsible for the next person.”
Many students said they would like to see more flexible lease lengths from the off-campus housing facilities.
“The best way to help us with this is just to do 10-month leases,” Swaminathan said. “I wouldn’t mind paying a little extra for that, just to avoid all of this.”
A shorter lease for students is not always feasible for housing companies, however.
“Our leases are yearlong,” said Anthony Montana, assistant manager of Moraga Student Housing. “We’re a small business. There is no way we can go three months without rent. The owners are trying to adapt to accommodate students, but I don’t know how much more they can do.”

Despite questions about the fairness and legality of unpaid internships, students shouldn’t expect to find any more paid internships this summer than in previous years.
Many companies that are trying to maximize production while minimizing costs are placing increased responsibility in interns’ hands. And with a 10.4 percent national unemployment rate, young people eager to gain access to careers are willing to work for free.
According to USC Career Planning & Placement Center Executive Director Eileen Kohan, about 60 percent of the university’s students hold an internship sometime during their USC career.
“The feedback we are getting from employers is that having work experience is more important than grade-point average,” she said.
But for students from low-income families, taking unpaid work often means trading an opportunity to earn money for the possibility of better earnings later. And now, in a time when unpaid internship opportunities are booming, some are questioning whether organizations are taking advantage of ambitious students as a way to deal with their economic woes.
A 1947 Supreme Court decision outlined six factors for determining if an internship results in a relationship that would require the intern to be paid minimum wage and be entitled to overtime pay and regular breaks.
An intern who pushes wheelchairs at a hospital could be replacing a nurse’s job, according to Kerry Fields, a professor at the Marshall School of Business and an expert in business ethics and corporate responsibility. If the intern meets professionals, gets exposure to the hospital environment and receives an education about how to treat disabled people, however, the internship appears to mainly benefit the student. It’s training that can be carried into many different future settings.
Fields said legal unpaid internships should be geared toward training and not assuming an employee’s regular duties, though the company might generate some collateral benefit.
“Where unscrupulous employers take advantage is having you do work activities that have a benefit primarily to them,” Fields said. “Having you file papers so the employer saves costs of hiring a file clerk is illegal.”
Instead, Fields said interns should be cycled through the roles of several full-time employees. Still, he said the standard for being paid is subjective because one has to define an experience’s value.
The U.S. Department of Labor has ruled that unpaid internships should be extensions of academic programs under close observation and should not replace regular jobs.
To make unpaid internships seem more beneficial to students, companies often require students to receive academic credit. This is not legally necessary, however.
“The law doesn’t absolutely require it, even though it is packaged that way,” Fields said. “Credit gives employers some validity and assurance to hide behind.”
USC allows students to earn credit through various internship courses from one to eight units. Interns put off by USC’s $1,300-per-unit price can receive less expensive credit from institutions such as community colleges. During the summer, USC provides scholarships to help subsidize the cost of these courses.
The Dream Dollars Program provides $1,200 stipends for students who receive unpaid internships with non-profit or government organizations. The Scheyer Family Scholarship provides $2,500 to unpaid interns majoring in the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences. Applications for both programs are due Friday.
“We are very conscious of the fact that money does cause a barrier, but students can use the career center to help find foundations and other ways to get past this,” Kohan said.
A number of students, however, take unpaid internships without ever registering to receive class credit.
Liz Trawick, a senior majoring in psychology, is working as an unpaid intern for a city councilman, though she has not registered for a class to receive credit.
“I’m doing a lot of work, but the city has no money, so that’s probably why I’m not getting paid,” she said. “As a student, it’s reasonable not to be paid, but not being a student and not finding anything paid is unreasonable.”
Juhae Lee, a freshman majoring in industrial and systems engineering, has an unpaid internship with a public relations firm for which he is mainly doing graphic designing. Lee also does not receive academic credit for his internship.
“It’s benefitting me more than the firm, though, because before I just had Photoshop, but they have pushed me to learn how to use it, and now I’m solid with it,” he said.
Drew Holly, a senior majoring in music industry, held an internship with a recording company and took two four-unit internship courses through USC.
“I learned a lot even though I was only really setting up equipment and helping with recording, and the class was hardly a class,” he said.
Students have different feelings as to whether they should be paid.
Kyle Manis, a sophomore majoring in business administration, had a paid internship with Verizon but is now seeking an unpaid Congressional internship.
“It’s not as much about getting paid as it is about learning, because the pay is really just a bonus,” he said.
For Lee, the costs of traveling to the Beverly Hills firm are adding up, and he said he thinks he should be compensated for work that the company takes credit for.
“It’s not just like I’m getting coffee for them,” he said. “You shouldn’t have to pay for or buy your way into the opportunity to show off your skills, but what can you do about it?”
In California, any employee can file a complaint with the state labor department about unfair treatment of interns, but it is mainly the intern’s decision to allege he is being taken advantage of. Because students and employees fear being blacklisted as troublemakers in their industry, the burden of enforcement falls to the government.
Fields said students simply need to be better educated about the laws, and the federal department of labor has vowed to increase outreach with students and colleges.
I’m very glad that publications are finally examining the discriminative nature of unpaid internships. Even for people from solid middle class backgrounds like myself, working an entire summer for free can be a very unrealistic prospect, especially in these hard economic times. While there will never be an “end” to unpaid internships, I think more regulation is definitely necessary. All they really accomplish is one more step of privatizing our country’s entire educational system. Simply getting into and attending college is a serious financial endeavor. Now to have another roadblock thrown in the track in the form of unpaid internships and their professional importance…it’s quite discouraging.
What’s your complaint, exactly? Nobody should be allowed to do an unpaid internship because you personally can’t afford it? If you force all these jobs to pay minimum wage, one of two things are going to happen: (a) the internship will be canceled because it isn’t worth it to the company, or (b) the company will hire an actual qualified adult instead of a student who wants to learn on the job.

USC will host the South Asian Studies Association’s fourth annual conference this weekend, drawing experts and speakers from around the world.
SASA is an international, non-profit organization dedicated toward the study and advancement of South Asia, specifically India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The event, titled “South Asia and the West: Entwined, Entangled and Engaged,” will be held at the Davidson Conference Center and is co-sponsored by USC’s Office of Religious Life, Asian Pacific American Student Services and the Center for Transpacific Studies.
The conference will feature presentations from more than 100 South Asian scholars and more than 30 panel sessions, all of which address the cultural, political and religious dynamics of South Asian countries.
Suman Pendakur, director of APASS, hopes the SASA conference will create meaningful dialogue and debate.
“South Asia and its diasporas are extremely complex, and so having the opportunity to bring a conference like this to USC’s global campus gives us a chance to engage with multiple levels of dialogue,” Pendakur said.
Varun Soni, dean of USC’s Office for Religious Life, said he hopes the conference will highlight the relationship between South Asia and other parts of the world.
“The popular mind tends to focus on the differences between South Asia and the West, yet throughout history there has been constant interchange, with each side learning from and impacting the other,” Soni said in a release. “Our conference will examine this dynamic through multiple disciplinary lenses.”
Students from APASS said they think the event will be a good experience.
“It’s really great because people of different majors and academic disciplines can find some topic or topics of interest since the list of panels is so diverse,” said Bonnie Lau, a junior majoring in art history and international relations. “I know there will be senior policy experts, so it would be a great conference for international relations majors and minors to attend.”
Katie Wongthipkongka, a junior majoring in kinesiology, agreed.
“I think the conference would be useful because it brings together lots of people and perspectives on important issues,” she said. “It’s also good to exchange ideas with other people, and I think the conference enables people to do that.”
The event is free for all USC students, faculty and staff with a USC I.D. Tickets are $95 for non-USC students and $175 for all others,  and can be purchased at www.sasia2.org.

Springfest and Relay for Life, arguably the two biggest events of the spring semester, have been scheduled for the same day for the second year in a row, leaving organizers concerned about the attendance for both.
Show time · Last year’s Springfest, held on McCarthy Quad, also coincided with Relay for Life, the fundraiser held on Cromwell Field. - Daily Trojan file photo
Springfest is an annual free concert organized by Program Board and held at McCarthy Quad. This year, the popular rapper T-Pain will headline the event. Relay for Life is an annual 24-hour walkathon at Cromwell Field that raises money for cancer research. Both events, which will be held April 10, tend to draw a large number of people.
“We didn’t want them to be conflicting,” said Erica Worthington, a junior majoring in psychology who is the relay coacher for USC Relay for Life. “We wanted people to enjoy both of these events on their own.”
Melissa Park, a senior majoring in industrial and systems engineering and a co-chair of USC Relay for Life, said she is worried about the impact this year’s headliner might have on Relay for Life.
“I understand the draw that T-Pain has, and it’s a phenomenal thing because not many campuses can boast that they bring artists like that, but it’s too bad that people have to make a choice for one or the other,” Park said.
Richie Pizano, director of the concerts committee for Program Board, said he would prefer the events not be held on the same day but noted that there could be a positive side to the situation.
“Having both on the same day does hinder both events,” Pizano said. “But at the same time, not everyone is at one event at the same time. If students are already on campus, it’s easy to move back and forth, so it does help.”
The events were held concurrently last year after event organizers mistakenly booked the same day.
“Last year, we didn’t really know that they were on the same day,” Worthington said. “We didn’t think about Springfest and were focused on planning [Relay for Life]. We found out the month before.”
This year, organizers had hoped to better coordinate the two events, but they failed to communicate clearly with each other and the two events are once again scheduled for the same day.
“It was more individual efforts,” Worthington said. “We didn’t contact Program Board first semester, but we looked it up online.”
Pizano said the date for Springfest has been set since May.
“I think the two parties didn’t communicate because it just didn’t occur to us [in May],” Pizano said. “It was pure coincidence.”
Worthington said Relay for Life organizers looked up the Springfest date online before choosing a date for the walkathon but thought Springfest was a different weekend.
By the time the two groups realized their events would coincide, it was too late.
“We use the track, and we have to find time when the track team has an away meet. We also work around Swim with Mike and Songfest,” Worthington said.
Pizano said it’s very difficult to reschedule an event on McCarthy Quad after a date has been booked because it’s a very popular venue.
Beyond attendance, Park said she is concerned about the possibility of Springfest’s main performance conflicting with Relay for Life’s luminaria ceremony, when participants light candles and honor those who have battled cancer.
The luminaria ceremony, Park said, is typically one of the most moving parts of the event, and she does not want it to be interrupted by music from Springfest.
Last year, organizers for both groups coordinated so that no performers would be on during the ceremony, but they have yet to reach any kind of agreement this year.
Many students said they think it is unfortunate that the two events conflict again this year.
“I would definitely go to both if they were on separate days, but because Springfest has T-Pain, which I feel is a bigger draw; I’ll probably go there instead,” said Sommer Sorensen, a junior majoring in anthropology.
Brooke Nixt, a sophomore majoring in business administration, agreed.
“It’s too bad that the events are conflicting because Relay for Life is such an important cause,” she said. “I feel like Springfest might draw people away.”
In the future, organizers for both events said they would communicate to prevent double-booking the same day.
“People do bring it up, and it’s unfortunate, but I can’t do anything about it,” Pizano said. “In the future, the two parties should start communicating. We continuously book a year in advance, so Relay should check with us.”
Park agreed.
“It’s an unfortunate occurrence,” she said. “There should be more awareness about when each event is taking place.”

Imagine Los Angeles’ public services closed for two days a week — no courts, no libraries, nothing except public safety services and independent businesses. This radical idea to close the city two days a week sounds like a hoax; something that might have originated from a late-night comedy sketch.
Sadly, the only punchline is that our city’s budget crisis is so dire that Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is proposing such a drastic measure. City Controller Wendy Greuel has projected that at the current rate of spending, the city will run out of money and be in $10 million in debt by May 5 of this year.
The Los Angeles City Council, naturally, was bewildered and outraged at Villaraigosa’s proposal. For one, it would furlough about 22,000 of the city’s employees, violating labor contracts.
What’s worse, the budget issue has devolved into a vicious cycle of finger-pointing that detracts from the city government’s ability to actually craft any actual plans of action, which has left the government at a loss for what to do.
How did this apocalyptical scenario even materialize? Sure, Los Angeles County has one of the worst unemployment rates in the country at 12.5 percent, and public universities have already felt the pinch with tuition increases last year. But closing the entire city except its core functions twice a week seems absurd.
The last straw came Monday, when the Board of Water and Power Commission, which presides over the L.A. Department of Water and Power and usually transfers $220 million to the city’s general fund every year, announced it could not make the transfer.
Sullivan Brown | Daily Trojan
The LADWP didn’t receive adequate funding this year because of the city council’s opposition to Villaraigosa’s previous 12-month rate hike, so the LADWP did not have a surplus from which to transfer the funds. In fact, it has only transferred $143 million, with the remaining $73.5 million currently under contention.
There is heated disagreement between Mayor Villaraigosa and the City Council, who are at odds over how to save the city from running out of funds. Villaraigosa eventually withdrew his initial proposal to close the city — after all, his sole authority cannot push through the measure without the approval of the City Council. Regardless, the DWP has received a lot of heat over the funds.
Former DWP commission President Nick Patsaouras, who is filing a lawsuit against the DWP, claims that the utility has an 8
percent surplus, which is enough to provide the money. “As a taxpayer, I want to compel them, compel the DWP, to honor their commitment,” he said.
Needless to say, to have Los Angeles run out of money would create chaos in a climate already wrought with anxiety. But the problem is that none of the parties is willing to cede any ground: Villaraigosa, who has some control over the DWP, is at a stalemate with the opposing City Council, whose main concern is to keep the city funded.
Employees are not willing to take a cut in their salaries in order to save their city. The city is enveloped in what the mayor calls “the politics of ‘no’” and “the kind of demagoguery you see in the Congress.”
Instead of playing “a crazier and crazier game of chicken,” as Councilman Paul Koretz called it, an immediate solution needs to be drawn out before the funds run out.
Across the globe, a bloody riot broke out in Kyrgyzstan’s capital on Wednesday. It was a riot fueled by bitter feelings toward President Kurmanbek Bakiyev’s policies of brutality and corruption festering in the opposition group. However, this riot was fueled by a dramatic increase in utility rates.
Sounds familiar, but hopefully on a much more intense scale than what the city of Los Angeles would have to face.

I never thought I’d see the day when a race-pandering Democrat mayor of Los Angeles would swallow hard and admit, “We’ve got to stop spending more than we have.” There may be hope for this city and this state yet.

It has been one of the most talked-about topics among seniors. In addition to the usual panic over career placement, moving and who to send graduation announcements to, we have all been wondering who will speak at this year’s commencement. The commencement organizers decided to give us … (drumroll, please): our own President Sample.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Oh yes, the university really had to stretch its networking contacts in order to bring us our very own president to give the parting words  to the 2010 graduating class.
To be fair, it makes sense for Sample to be given the chance to speak, since this is his final year at USC and he has racked up an astounding number of accomplishments while devoting his life and energy to this school for the last 19 years. But it doesn’t take away from the disappointment that comes with this announcement, considering how highly it was anticipated.
In the past, USC has been among those enviable colleges that consistently recruit celebrities and other impressive name-brand speakers to send our newest alumni out into the world. As the Daily Trojan reported on Tuesday, former speakers include Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ted Koppel, Neil Armstrong and Bill Cosby. It seems, however, that we have joined the group of primarily smaller schools who focus on finding someone dependable rather than flashy, to make a well-rounded (albeit usually generic) speech about the rewards of hard work and the thrills of the unexplored road ahead.
The general senior consensus on Sample seems to be one of dissatisfaction. We only graduate from college once; we want it to be as special as it has been for students in the past.
It is not as if the university lacks a long list of “very important persons” to contact. The film school alone has enough star-studded alumni to fill the Shrine Auditorium; couldn’t the organizers have given Uncle George (Lucas) a ring?
The news is even more disheartening considering the impressive speakers that will be attending other college’s graduation ceremonies. Yale snagged Bill Clinton; Harvard landed former Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter; Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of General Electric, will speak at  Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y.; and actor Danny Glover is traveling all the way to Logan, Utah, to visit Utah State University.
Granted, it was easy for seniors to get carried away with our list of speaker hopefuls. Names such as Oprah, Steve Jobs and Hillary Clinton were tossed around, though these expectations were pie in the sky. We all knew that there was no way Barack Obama would be coming to Los Angeles to talk to seniors on a smoggy summer morning, but many seemed to secretly hope that someone almost equally as impressive would grace us with their presence.
In fact, the president will be addressing the class of 2010 at both  the University of Michigan and Hampton University.
Lucky devils.
Additionally, the first lady will be speaking at George Washington University. Michelle Obama challenged the students to complete 100,000 hours of community service in exchange for her attendance at commencement on May 16, a mission they accomplished just last week.
Graduation is such an important milestone in a person’s life. Commencement is a day that marks the beginning of our futures, our entry into adulthood. The speaker is charged with the task of bestowing some enlightening anecdotes and advice to graduating students while simultaneously entertaining their visiting friends and relatives.
There’s no doubt that Sample will give a meaningful and
resounding speech. He is well-regarded for his inspiring presence and is sure to deliver a message worthy of his send-off. In fact, many students, while disappointed in his lack of star power, are indeed excited by the announcement.
However, it remains unsatisfactory that we weren’t able to secure a more exciting public figure like we’ve had in years past. After all, we’re USC; we tend to hold a bit of clout among the collegiate set. Surely we could have booked someone who would have granted us some bragging rights among our friends from high school.
The best way to satisfy the demands of the student body would be for the university to grant seniors some participation in determining their commencement speaker. Ballots should be available online at the beginning of the year where students could list their ideal speakers, and the university would try to contact the most popular recommendations.
Even if the proposed candidates were unavailable, students would at least feel like they had some say in determining whose speech they would sit through at the end of the year, making it a more personal selection process.
To be honest, at the end of the day, most students will probably barely even remember the commencement speech, since they’ll still be rubbing the sleep from their eyes after their early wake up.
But perhaps if someone more notable walked up to the podium that morning, the speech would not be so easily forgotten and the students’ grogginess would instead give way to excitement.

For all of USC’s bragging about becoming a top school, the pride, (and well warranted), the excitement, how it is now more difficult to get into than ever, more applicants than ever, competing with big name schools and now top on lists, etc etc etc..and ‘global’, expanding, more international students, study   abroad, etc. etc. etc., the choice of Sample as speaker for commencement  is such a contradiction to that, it just seems so ‘small town’ and ‘insular’ for where this school is now….yes, he is partly responsible for that, but have a special DAY to honor him, have a special WEEK for him, with tributes  in his honor to give HIM the send off HE deserves..but commencement is for THE STUDENTS… no one is saying he has not done an amazing job and  just about everyone recognizes that..so honor him at commencement, but not have him as the guest speaker, when most  have heard him speak many times over at school through the years. And he is a wonderful speaker.. but this is the students day.   If USC is indeed up there with the other famous world renown schools then why not have guest speakers on the level  those schools have? Not just some ‘celeb’, but someone OUT THERE in the WORLD,  outside of the school, who has accomplished things BEYOND USC, since the hope is that our graduates will have many accomplishments BEYOND USC..I think Sample has done an amazing job. I also think he should recognize this as a once in a lifetime event for the grads, and should have been a big man, and been willing to step aside and give them the send off they deserve. Or all the bragging, all the notices sent to homes and e-mails regarding how great USC has become, pale,  if the class graduating, at what seems to be the height of that rise, can’t have a world renown speaker of note on their commencement day, as other top schools have. . It seems that everything at USC has GROWN, except in this area. This area has now, this year,  gotten SMALLER…If there was a committee in charge of seeking out and booking a speaker for this special day they should all be replaced, as this was not only a huge oversight, a big mistake of judgment,  but seems to be laziness, taking the low road,  in the extreme. Or was it University POLITICS, which would be very sad as it is the graduates  who suffer …The students have been encouraged to ‘go for it’ to think big, think global, expand themselves in their years at USC, just as the school has done.. and then they get the easiest choice to speak at their graduation…and the grads, who have worked so hard, and have been so committed to, and proud of,  the greatness of their school,   deserve better on THEIR very special day..not the President’s day, not the Alums day, not the UNIVERSITY POWERS THAT BE day, but  THEIR day.
As a current sophomore, I think the class of 2010 should feel honored they get to hear Sample speak for perhaps the last time at a USC graduation ceremony.  
O boy wont I be lucky in two years that I will get the possibility of hearing a “celebrity” at my graduation ceremony
As a graduate of USC, I cannot remember who our commencement speaker was.  However, if it had been Dr. Steven Sample, I would have never forgotten and would have forever been proud to say he addressed our class.  Sample has turned USC into a top-ranked university which ultimately  makes every diploma  more prestigious and our students more marketable.
We should all be grateful for the time, energy, and commitment he has given to the students and community of USC.
Leave Amy alone.  Her article reflects the views shared by lots of people, not just her.
All of us are incredibly grateful to President Sample for his tireless work on behalf of USC.
But President Sample speaks EVERY YEAR at graduation.  He also speaks THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.
We have ALREADY HEARD HIM.   A better programming decision would be to honor Sample and also let someone ELSE speak.  Amy, like many other USC grads including me, just wants to hear someone who has been successful in a place OTHER THAN USC.
This writer has her priorities mixed up.  She appears more enamored with shallow celebrity and name recognition than with excellence.  What a shame.  Dr. Sample is one of the most gifted and inspiring speakers I have ever heard.  How lucky USC has been to have been the focus of his talent and genius for so many years.  The graduates will undoubtedly long remember what he says at their commencement.  More importantly, the graduates would be better served to remember what they learned during their years at the University.  This writer needs to re-think what constitutes her entry to adulthood.
This article is an embarrassment.  President Sample has been the driving force behind USC’s rise to academic excellence over the past decade.  He might not be the flashiest, or most well-known Commencement speaker to those outside of the wall of the University, but he’s going to provide an insightful, intelligent and motivating speech.  I only wish my graduating class of ’06 would have been able to listen to Sample – Instead we got Mayor Villarigosa, who is much more well-known among Angelenos, yet was unable to provide us with anything tangible to hold onto once we tossed our caps into the air.
I never realized that commencement addresses only existed so we could brag about them to our high school friends.
The speech will be good no matter who gives it, and I for one applaud the choice of Steve Sample.  He’s helped raise USC to it’s current high standing, and his speech will no doubt have the same wisdom and tact that Sample has shown through his presidency.
honestly, I’m not too invested in who’s speaking — but it kind of feels like yet another tribute to Sample leaving USC — 2010’s senior class is, too!
I’d MUCH rather listen to a decent man who lives by principles
than a corrupt half-breed politician from Chicago who uses everyone
as a stepping stone in his quest for power & fame & glory.
Only weaklings admire such pathetic “humans”.
tjay, you’re low class. Get over it. 
…I wish we had Obama for our speaker.
Honestly, It’s very disappointing to see the DT take this stance, and I agree with USC Alum.  This is a college graduation – not the red carpet.  
Steven Sample has done amazing things for this university, and many students have never even seen him in person – much a less had a chance to hear him speak. Yes, maybe his name isn’t always in the limelight  – but his actions and choices have affected both the school, and yes, the world. 
Petty complaints aside, Sample is a perfectly capable orator. A commencement speech should not be about “bragging rights” – it should be a reflection of the college and a reflection on the global journey that you seniors face.
Why does  your list of “stars” entirely consist of famous ultra-liberals? (Clinton, Obama, Oprah, Souter, the list goes on…)  And movie stars! You want a movie star to give a commencement speech? How about hearing from somebody who has actually ACCOMPLISHED something? Steven Sample is the best commencement speaker I’ve heard USC select in YEARS. He is part of the Trojan Family and has spent the last 20 years shaping our educations based on what he believes we need to learn in order to be competitive in the world. I’m very interested to hear what he has to say.
PS: RE: “The best way to satisfy the demands of the student body would be for the university to grant seniors some participation … Ballots should be available online …students could list their ideal speakers … and the university would try to contact the most popular recommendations.”
What ten-year-old came up with this idea?
How about “The best way would be for seniors to take some goddamned initiative and, if there’s a particular speaker they want, talk to the speaker and lobby the university to invite him.”
Amy, you need to hear a speech from an “impressive” speaker like Danny Glover or Oprah to make your graduation day special??  After four years at USC, you haven’t learned a thing about what is truly important in life, have you?  I hope you do not represent the rest of your class.   President Sample has raised the level of prestige of that diploma you will be holding to incredible heights and yet you want to hear Oprah make jokes about pomegranate martinis.  Get a life, girl.
Maybe we need to re-evaluate our definition of who qualifies for “star power.” At some point the graduates will realize the real stars in the world are not the few that make the news everyday, but those that work tirelessly, behind the scenes for the good of many of us.
Quit complaining!  USC doesn’t always get superstars to do commencement speeches.  When I graduated waaaay back in 1994, the speaker was none other than George Olah!  Oh wait, his name doesn’t ring any bells?  Well, the same “outrage” was printed in the DT and heard throughout the student community at that time.   He was (maybe still is) an SC professor in Organic Chemistry who was awarded a Nobel prize that year.  He was a perfectly competent speaker, but honestly I don’t remember what he said.  
In 6 months you won’t even care, so let it go.  Live with it, enjoy your graduation, and get on with your life!  
Congratulations to all soon-to-be graduating Trojans!
Fifth paragraph from the end of this article, – “After all, we’re USC;….”. I do believe USC students have Steven Sample to thank for this.  And, by extension,  I believe that USC students have Steven Sample to thank for the fact that graduates will always want to say, “Hey, I’m a USC alum!” .  Listen carefully at commencenment.  I am sure he will teach us something that will last a lifetime.

For a team with offensive stars like Anthony Davis, Pat Haden and J.K. McKay, the 1974 USC football team was not the ideal place for placekicker Chris Limahelu to stand out in a crowd.
But stand out was exactly what the 5’5”, 135 pound kicker did.
In two seasons as a starter for the Trojans, from 1973-1974, the Indonesia-native kicked himself into the school’s history books.
In 1973, Limahelu went 14-of-18 on field goal tries, and while this percentage today would likely not earn a kicker high praise, his 14 successful attempts were six more than any kicker at the university had ever made.
At a time when football was a much more touchdown-oriented game, Limahelu’s unheralded achievements changed the way team’s approached facing the cardinal and gold. In addition to his record-setting 14 kicks, Limahelu also nailed a game-winning kick to beat Stanford, and a USC-record 47-yard strike in the Rose Bowl against Ohio State.
A year later, Limahelu continued cementing his legacy at USC with an extraordinary 50-yard kick against rival UCLA. For his efforts on the little-appreciated special teams side of the No.1 Trojans in 1974, Limahelu received all Pac-8 honors (went 10-of-17 on field goals and 39-of-43 on PATs).
While his career ended in 1975 with a higher level of fanfare than it began with, Limahelu went on to become an accountant in Pasadena where he also volunteered for the Tournament of Roses the past 15 years.
On Wednesday, after a long battle with prostate cancer, the former USC great passed away at the age of 59.
Although today’s generation of Trojan’  fans are more familiar with names like Mario Danilo, David Buehler and Jordon Congdon, it was the remarkable foot of Limahelu that captivated the USC faithful during the glory days of the 1970s.
The university announced that a private funeral service will be held for friends and family, as well as an additional public memorial for fans who want to pay tribute to one of the program’s most remarkable success stories.
