While there was no lightning on Thursday, thunder erupted inside the Belasco Theater as Imagine Dragons took the stage for an intimate concert with L.A. fans. 
The show was first in a four-part virtual reality concert series hosted by Citi, Live Nation and NextVR, and was recorded in VR for fans to enjoy at home.
As the lights dimmed to glimmers of blues, violets and pinks, drummer Daniel Platzman, guitarist Wayne Sermon and bassist Ben McKee appeared. After several booming drum beats, lead singer Dan Reynolds finally appeared to perform the first song of the night, “Thunder.” 
Heavy drum beats, electrifying guitar melodies and roaring applause filled the venue as the indie rock band played popular songs throughout its discography. Following “Gold,” Reynolds took a quick break from the music to share an appreciation story about Sermon, whose birthday was on the same night. 
“He was born to be a musician,” Reynolds said before resuming with a lively performance of the band’s all-time hit “It’s Time.”
With fan favorites such as “It’s Time,” “Amsterdam,” and “Hear Me,” fans throughout the venue chanted and sang along to every chorus with Imagine Dragons.
A spectrum of colors filled the stage for each song, seemingly resonating with Imagine Dragons’ concept for its upcoming album Evolve. While the band didn’t perform its newest song “Walking the Wire” — which was released the same day — it did play two other songs from the highly anticipated project: “Whatever It Takes” and “Believer.”
Slowing down the pace of the night halfway through the set, Reynolds sang part of “Bleeding Out” as an interlude before leading fans to an emotional rendition of “Demons.”
The band continued to fluctuate between electrifying and emotional songs, keeping fans engaged while also giving them small breaks in between Platzman’s thunderous drumbeats and Reynolds’ habit of belting out every final chorus. 
In the final four songs of the night, Imagine Dragons kept fans on their toes by tricking them into thinking the show was over. Perhaps an intentional move to surprise and excite the audience, the trick caused some members in the audience to exit the venue prematurely before the set even ended. 
Reynolds thanked fans for their commitment and loyalty over the past eight years and spoke about the band’s upcoming album.
“[Going back home] gave me perspective to look back on everything that’s happened,” Reynolds said. “I’m overwhelmed with appreciation.”
Fans cheered and sang along to the upbeat tune “I Bet My Life” before the entire band left the stage for a couple minutes. Then, Platzman returned to deliver a deafening, yet impressive solo as a prelude to “On Top of the World.”
What could have been a positive ending to the show ended up becoming the build-up to a dramatic, jolting finish to Imagine Dragons’ concert. Multi-colored lights flashed across the stage as the band passionately carried through a captivating performance of “Believer,” the lead single off Evolve.
After a moment of darkness, the show finally came to an end with what was arguably the best performance of the night. A stream of green lights permeated across the stage as Imagine Dragons delivered an extra rock-and-roll rendition of “Radioactive.” The band rocked the night away with a two-minute instrumental segment that pulsated throughout the venue even after the lights dimmed.
While the show only lasted about 90 minutes, Imagine Dragons filled the time with a well-balanced setlist that captivated fans and casual listeners. Reynolds, McKee, Sermon and Platzman all had their own shining moments — something often rare among bands with only one leading vocalist. Moments like Reynolds banging on Platzman’s cymbals or Sermon and Platzman strumming melodies together made the band’s chemistry come to life on stage. 
Though it would have perhaps been a more strategic move to preview some of their upcoming songs, Imagine Dragons nonetheless owned the night with passionate deliveries and great fan interaction.

Katie Chin | Daily TrojanLong road ahead · Senior middle blocker Jordan Dunn and the Trojans will kick off their 2017 season against Loyola Marymount on Aug. 25.
The women’s volleyball team will open its season against Loyola Marymount.
The Trojans released their 2017 schedule on Thursday, as USC enters the fall looking to build on its 2016 campaign — when the program finished 18-14 in its first season after the graduation of all-time points, kills and aces leader Samantha Bricio.
Head coach Mick Haley’s squad will face numerous challenges during the upcoming campaign. The Trojans are scheduled to play 11 teams that made the NCAA Tournament last season, including four regional finalists. They will also face defending national champions Stanford twice in Pac-12 play.
USC kicks off the year with four non-conference tournaments, beginning with one in Los Angeles against LMU, Michigan and Albany. The Trojans play the Lions at LMU on Aug. 25 to open the season before hosting Michigan at the Galen Center for their home opener.
USC then heads to Omaha, Neb., for the Bluejay Invitational, where the team will take on national quarterfinalist Creighton on its home floor in addition to Northern Iowa and Kentucky.
Finally, the Trojans wrap up their out-of-conference slate with tournaments in Santa Barbara and Maryland. USC locks horns with Arkansas, UCSB and Yale on the West Coast before facing Maryland and Oklahoma out east. By the time Haley and company begin league play on Sept. 20, the Trojans will have played 11 non-conference games.
The team will have to adjust to Pac-12 opposition quickly, too, as USC’s first conference matchup comes in Westwood against UCLA. Four days later, the Trojans have their Pac-12 home opener against Oregon State. The rematch against the Bruins at the Galen Center doesn’t come until the final day of the regular season on Nov. 25.
USC will play two matches against all Pac-12 opponents next fall — one home and one away — except Oregon State. The highlight of the conference schedule likely comes when national champions visit L.A. on Oct. 15. The Trojans travel to Stanford, Calif., for a rematch exactly one month later.
This year’s national champion will be crowned on Dec. 16 in Kansas City, Mo. Led by hall-of-fame coach Haley, USC begins its journey there on Aug. 25 at LMU’s Gersten Pavilion.
Who are the new top recruits that are desperately needed to make this team highly competitive.? Haley is another coach who
has seen his better days at USC. Swann sits on his rear end in too many sports with staying status quo.

The quarterback position isn’t currently a pressing concern for USC, but the Trojans’ future prospects under center took a hit on Saturday, as five-star prospect Matt Corral de-committed from the program.
Corral, ranked as a top-five overall quarterback in his class, had verbally committed to USC in February 2016. Alabama, Florida and Georgia now lead the race to sign him, per 247Sports.
After the bad news over the weekend, however, head coach Clay Helton rebounded quickly. The Trojans secured a verbal committment from three-star offensive tackle Liam Douglass out of Harvard-Westlake on Monday night.
But the biggest news came on Tuesday, when four-star center Justin Dedich announced his committment to USC. Dedich is the top-ranked player in his class at his position, and he spurned an offer from UCLA to join the Trojans.
Dedich gives Helton seven committments in his 2018 class so far.
What exactly are the DETAILS behind the “USC pulled his scholarship offer…” commentary I’ve seen from some seemingly butthurt SC fans…?
I expect this is a rumor, because, among other reasons, the guys who have said this appear to be your run-of-the-mill, delusional and/or butthurt college football msg-boarders (e.g. ALL of the guys who said this were testing the weight limit of his bandwagon…right up until the moment he decommitted).
~They bring up the Gretzky thing (old, irrelevant news…and not damning, even if he’s given no benefit of the doubt);
~They mention some newfound physical/psychological impairment;
~And/or they quip off 1-3 names they suddenly “…prefer to Corral,” despite a discernible gap in talent and potential.
Any clue about the truth of this matter…or a legit possible source of the info?
***I did see ONE instance of a known industry guy or “insider” who mentioned it with no further explanation or context provided — all blog fodder beyond that.

Katie Chin | Daily TrojanBeantown bound? · The Boston Red Sox selected redshirt junior shortstop Frankie Rios in the 17th round of last week’s MLB Draft. Rios now has around a month to decide whether or not to sign a professional deal and forgo his final year of college eligibility at USC.
Last week, two Trojans were selected in the 2017 Major League Baseball Draft. The Boston Red Sox picked redshirt junior Frankie Rios in the 17th round, and Washington Nationals took junior Adalberto Carrillo in the 33rd round. Though the duo retain the option to return to USC for their senior seasons, their selections brought the Trojans’ all-time draft tally to 330 players since the event’s inception in 1965.
Rios was taken with the 521st overall pick after earning All-Pac-12 honors in 2017. The shortstop led the team with 73 hits and a .354 batting average this season, and his 13 doubles were second-most on the Trojans.
Rios also earned an All-Pac-12 Honorable Mention last year, manning second base in his first campaign as a regular starter. He redshirted in 2015 with knee tendonitis, but in his three seasons at USC, Rios has compiled a .310 career average across 123 starts with 50 RBI and 28 extra-base hits. If he chooses to return for his final year of eligibility, Rios will come to campus as an alumnus after graduating in May with a sociology degree.
Carrillo, a 2017 all-conference honorable mention, was selected No. 1,003 overall. The junior has been a mainstay at third base for the past two years, memorably hitting his first collegiate home run against No. 1 Vanderbilt in 2014: a walk-off shot to down the Commodores in the bottom of the ninth inning. Interestingly, Washington drafted Carrillo as a catcher, despite him having never played the position as a Trojan.
The Nationals may be looking to utilize Carrillo’s versatile offensive tools at a traditionally light-hitting position. Carrillo led USC in stolen bases (9) and RBI (36) this season, and he was tied for the lead in home runs (7). If he chooses to sign with Washington, he will depart USC with 15 homers and 16 steals to go with 105 career hits.
Senior outfielder Corey Dempster went undrafted last week after opting to return to USC as a 37th-round pick last year — the only Trojan to do so in his draft class. Carrillo and Rios were the only two Trojans selected, compared to the record 12 players taken in 2016. Unlike last season’s veteran roster, however, only 13 members of this year’s squad were draft-eligible.
Head coach Dan Hubbs may have also taken a hit on the recruiting end during the draft. Two top prospects in USC’s incoming freshman class, first baseman Nick Pratto and pitcher Hans Crouse, were selected in the first two rounds, meaning they must pass up lucrative professional offers to don cardinal and gold next spring. The Kansas City Royals selected Pratto No. 14 overall, while the Texas Rangers picked Crouse 66th overall (Crouse’s older brother, Marrick, has pitched at USC for two seasons).
Highly touted shortstop recruit Nick Allen then went to the Oakland Athletics in the third round. The Milwaukee Brewers took outfielder Je’von Carrier-Ward in the 12th round; pitcher Kyle Hurt and third baseman Ben Ramirez went to the Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago Cubs, respectively, in the late rounds.
 Though very unlikely, USC now stands to lose six of its 15 incoming recruits. A disappointing 2017 season could lead to more high school commits trying their hand at professional baseball. The Trojans finished last in the Pac-12 this spring with a 21-34 overall record.
Hubbs stinks plain and simple. Keeping him another year is a joke. Lost Pratto and Crouse already. Look what he has done
with older brother Crouse and Mitch Hart who were useless last season due to injury and poor coaching. A good coach is
someone who is coveted by other schools.

Paulina Ordaz | Daily TrojanLive the magic · The Wizarding World of Harry Potter will premiere “The Nighttime Lights at Hogwarts Castle,” a fireworks show with animated projections, on June 23. The show will be narrated by the Sorting Hat.
Fireworks displays are a tried and true method for keeping guests at theme parks, but it might be time for something new and more magical. That’s exactly what Universal Studios Hollywood has planned for The Wizarding World of Harry Potter come June 23 with the official premiere of “The Nighttime Lights at Hogwarts Castle.”
In the weeks leading up to opening night, a number of guests were treated to a preview of what will soon be a nightly experience cast on the Hogwarts Castle just across from Hogsmeade Village and the Triwizard Stage. The display of lights and animations projected onto the castle in conjunction with the film’s iconic score will immerse audiences in the show, as though they have been transported into the film series.
Narrated by the Sorting Hat, the show imitates the annual sorting ceremony at the beginning of every school year at Hogwarts, featuring a unique lights display for each of the four houses: Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Slytherin and Gryffindor. As each house is presented, its signature colors wrap around the intricate design of the castle along with an animation of its mascot as the house crest gradually appears at the top. One by one, each display elicits applause from the audience as they cheer for the house with which they identify.
At approximately five minutes in duration, the show wraps up with the fusion of all four houses as the Sorting Hat narrates, “There is nothing hidden in your head the Sorting Hat can’t see.”
With the grand finale, gold sparkling lights trickle down the castle and park guests are free to continue exploring the themed attractions, shops and eateries. At a glance, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is a visually accurate depiction of the film’s portrayal, but a bit of exploration confirms that it’s also interactive.
Aside from experiencing the two rides, “Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey” and “Flight of the Hippogriff,” some other popular activities include grabbing butterbeer at Hog’s Head Pub or picking out a personal wand at Ollivander’s.
“The Nighttime Lights at Hogwarts Castle” is more than a show — it’s an experience. For Harry Potter fans who grew up reading the novels and watching the movies on a screen, the opportunity to see the Hogwarts Castle replica light up in person is as close to an escape from the Muggle world as it gets.
For those who can’t make it to the park, Universal Studios Hollywood on Facebook will host a Facebook live event to stream the all-new “The Nighttime Lights at Hogwarts Castle” experience at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter on June 23 at 8:30 p.m. PST.

Few artists in the music industry today are able to ride the wave of their debut studio album to mainstream relevancy for four long years. It’s a painful, risky move, one that can alienate fans and signal career suicide if the final project doesn’t live up to lofty expectations. 
Acclaimed singer-songwriter Lorde embarked on that lengthy hiatus following the release of Pure Heroine in 2013, and in Melodrama she delivers a powerful testament of heartbreak while also displaying significant musical growth.
Perhaps the best modern comparison to her career arc thus far is Frank Ocean, who similarly crept out of the public eye after releasing channel ORANGE in 2012. Lorde cited his 2016 follow-up album Blonde as an inspiration to her instrumentation, noting how it opened up so many possibilities for what she could do with each track.
The production on Melodrama is brilliant throughout, filled with watery melodies set over gripping 808s and drums. In songs like “Hard Feelings/Loveless,” Lorde uses unusual sounds and background effects to keep the silence between bars compelling. She builds the moment beautifully on “Homemade Dynamite,” taking time to draw the listener in before exploding in the chorus.
The precise, carefully digitized production allows the album’s more organic moments to stand out nicely. “Liability” strips the soundscape down to just Lorde’s voice and a piano, allowing the singer’s passion to drive the song. In “Writer in the Dark,” she coldly repeats “Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark” over minimal backing, before climbing her vocal register on the chorus to make the listener feel her emotion. 
She puts care into the transitions around the songs to allow the album to flow smoothly, slowly bringing in the drums after “Liability” and starting “Supercut” in a capella immediately after “Writer in the Dark.” Lorde called the project a loose concept album, telling the story of a single house party. She tries to capture the complete essence of the party, from the jubilant moments in the limelight to the less glamorous, troubling side stories swirling around them. “Homemade Dynamite” delves into the former, describing that first interaction with someone that turns into something more.
 In the lead single “Green Light,” Lorde tells the story of “that drunk girl dancing around crying about her ex-boyfriend,” searching for closure in the wake of her explosive breakup. “Perfect Places” finds Lorde stepping outside the limelight entirely and looking back on her newfound fame, lamenting the illusions of “perfect places” she thought she’d find in her life.
Lyrically, Lorde frequently mixes abstract metaphors with blunt assertions on Melodrama. In “Sober,” she repeatedly asks the same question, “ But what will we do when we’re sober?” The lyrics complement the production at several points, such as the transition into the chorus in “The Louvre.” While speaking on the emotions of a budding relationship, she sings, “Can you feel the violence? / Megaphone to my chest,” before abruptly cutting out the melody. She leaves her pounding heartbeat with: “Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom and make ‘em all dance to it.” Later in “Supercut,” she speaks about replaying the perfect moments of her relationship in her head, trailing off her final words with, “In my head I do everything right,” and allowing the dreamy skeleton of the song to linger as the listener attempts to visualize Lorde’s memories.
In an era when more and more artists are building albums around themes and concepts, Melodrama is an impressive, cohesive work. None of the 11 tracks feel like filler material, and each song progressively moves Lorde’s narrative forward while also adding depth to her personal story. Hopefully it doesn’t take Lorde four more years to release another album, but even if it does, Melodrama is more than capable of standing the test of time.

A core team of five USC professors partnered with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority to conduct the annual homeless count in L.A. County. This marked the first time USC was involved in the LAHSA count. More than 350 volunteers, including students and alumni, assisted in collecting the data for the three-day count in January.
Professor Benjamin Henwood from the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work led USC’s consulting role on the initiative after the University’s provost office launched an all-school initiative to end homelessness last summer. Henwood is a co-leader of the Grand Challenge to End Homelessness through the American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare. He partnered with professors Robynn Cox and Karen Lincoln from the School of Social Work as well as professor Jennifer Ailshire from the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, to make up the core team of consultants. Cox said the multifaceted nature of the team, which comprised faculty from four different departments, was key to their success.
The results of the study, which were released earlier this month, show a 23-percent increase in the L.A. County homeless population from last year. Other notable statistics included a rise in first-time homelessness as well as a 64-percent increase in homelessness among youth and a 63-percent increase among the Latino population. Henwood also said significantly more members of the homeless population indicated having fled from violence.
“It speaks to the need of trauma-informed care when working with this population,” Henwood said. “I think there is a recognition that this is an issue that does exist and we don’t know a whole lot about.And we probably need to do more.”
Cox said the perception of homelessness being driven by substance abuse and mental health concerns is simply not true. Only 30 percent of all homeless people are reported to have a serious mental health concern, and a mere 18 percent reported to have  substance abuse issues.
“To me, that seems to suggest that [substance abuse and mental health concerns are] not really what’s driving the homelessness,” Cox said. “We have to look more generally at housing insecurity and [understand] what causes people to end up in homelessness so we can catch them before they get to the most extreme form of what we would consider housing insecurity.”
Though the study does not conclude on a source of homelessness, both Henwood and Cox said they believe housing costs are a contributing factor. 
“I would expect the number to go up next year too,” Henwood said. “We are as a county providing more and more housing. But at the same time I think what we’re seeing is a rental market where affordability is nonexistent.” 
Henwood cites data showing a drastic increase in rent compared to the slight increase in income. Many are a paycheck away from homelessness, he said. 
A 2016 pilot program estimated a homelessness prevention plan would spend $12,000 per family and $7,900 on each individual. LA County passed Measure H, allocating $40 million over the next three years for homelessness prevention, in March 2017. 
Moving forward, Cox said USC will continue supporting social workers in their efforts to eradicate homelessness. A number of clinical faculty members are looking for new ways to address the issue of homelessness, and countless students are out in the field training as well.
“I think there’s a lot that we’re doing,” Henwood said. “I know that there are also a lot of resources at the University that are being pulled together to try to figure out how to form a collective impact and I think that’s still an ongoing effort.”
 
Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly quoted Robynn Cox as saying researchers need to look more closely at “housing and security.” Cox was actually referring to “housing insecurity.”
This post has also been updated to clarify that homelessness caused by substance abuse and serious mental health issues is an incorrect perception, not a “stigma.”

Asian Pacific American Student Services Director Jonathan Wang is dedicated to making sure the students he works with get the support they need — and not just because that’s his job description.
As a first-generation Taiwanese American college student at UC San Diego,  Wang struggled to find his own calling.
“When I was at UCSD, I wish that I had an APASS, I wish that I had someone who I could talk with … I struggled with a lot in my first year,” Wang said. “I didn’t fit in somewhere, [I didn’t find] that sense of belonging, and that really guided me in how I work for the students here at USC.”
While Wang initially went into college to study management, he realized that his true passions lie with supporting students through college. As the first in his family to go to college, Wang is able to draw upon his own experiences in order to relate to the first-generation students that he works with at USC.
Wang became involved with a number of programs at UCSD where he supported students, including being a resident advisor and participating in an internship where he worked with a local charter school that served low-income students. While he initially started the internship as part of his education requirements, Wang fell in love with the program — and continued to work there for all four years of college.
“A lot of [the students at the charter school] were going to be the first in their family to go to college, which is kind of how I was the first in my family to go to college, so really, it was something I found myself in as I was helping these students,” Wang said.
After graduating from UCSD, Wang returned to his hometown to start a tutoring company, JKs Tutoring, for high school students. The company didn’t only focus on helping  kids receive good grades in high school, but also ensured that they would be prepared  for college.
“It was my way of trying to figure out how I could merge my major, in economics and operations management, with my passion for education,” he said. “A lot of it was college prep. We were mostly helping students with one class, but we were also looking at how that one class fit in the overall picture of getting these students through high school and into college.”
But Wang soon found that he was drawn more to working in student services at the college level. For that, he needed a graduate degree. After much deliberation, Wang chose to pursue a master’s degree in administration and student affairs at USC Rossier School of Education.
“It came down to University of Michigan and USC,” Wang said. “Both are top schools, but I’ve only ever lived in California, so I realized that I wanted my network to be in California.”
It was while pursuing his degree that Wang first became involved with USC APASS. He started a graduate assistantship at APASS, working with the the assistant director and director of the program at the time.
Just as Wang was graduating from his master’s program, both the assistant director and director of APASS found new jobs, which allowed Wang to apply for, and later become, the assistant director of the program. After a few years as the assistant director, the director position opened up again, which led Wang to where he is today.
He says that helping students from similar and different backgrounds truly demonstrates the importance of cultural centers like APASS at a school like USC.
“There are going to be students that experience college in different ways, they might be the first in their family to go to college, or they might be struggling through something, or they just need someone to talk to, and I hope that as … director now, that I’m allowing for the building of that community for them,” he said.
As APASS director, Wang has made many programs and opportunities possible for Asian American USC students. One of these is the CIRCLE program, which stands for “Critical Issues in Race, Class and Leadership Education.” It is a weekly leadership program that explores the experiences of Asians in America. The program has been at USC since 1998. Wang says that every year he learns more about himself and his students, and he sees the program as an experience that connects the community in a meaningful way.
Assistant APASS Director Queena Hoang, who has been working with Wang for the past year, said that Wang is known for mentoring his students.
“Jonathan does a really great job in helping students learn more about their identities and get them to go more in depth in their identity and work as an Asian American student,” Hoang said.
Another program, the Asian Pacific Islander Desi American Leaders special interest floor, is one that Wang and APASS are starting this year.
“We’re partnering with the Office of Residential Education and faculty members to have a floor dedicated for Asian American students,” Wang said. “We want to get students involved in really making the most out of their first year.”
“Jonathan has … [made] this a unique experience for first-year students in having a smoother transition into college and into USC, and creating a community where students will feel welcomed,” Hoang said.
Although Wang has worked on many programs for APASS, Hoang says Wang’s selflessness with his students is evident in the bonds he has with them. 
“He is really great at building relationships with students, and I think students really trust him as somebody who can offer great advice on a personal level … the students really appreciate and value the work that he does for them, and he’s very selfless in that work,” said Hoang. “The students can totally see that he does work for them, and not for himself.”
But the work he does for APASS isn’t all Wang is doing at the moment — he’s also pursuing a Doctor of Education from Rossier. 
“I love doing research, I really love the opportunity to learn about special populations in higher education and USC has been a great place for me,” Wang said.“I just found that the doctoral program was everything that I needed and everything I was looking for.”
Ultimately, Wang hopes that his work in student services and APASS specifically serve to push USC forward and uphold the values of the Trojan Family.
“At this point in our society at USC, [we’re lucky] to have all of these resources and support available for our students,” Wang said. “In the interactions that I have with students and faculty … and especially when it comes to campus issues and campus climate … we’ve been struggling through it, but I do see that there is more being done.”

School may be out for summer, but the Department of Education is still in session. This is bad news for students who will return to pursue their education with more debt and fewer opportunities. In the shadow of the Justice Department’s investigation of President Donald Trump, the Department of Education has managed extreme policy changes despite congressional deadlock, halting the progress of the Obama administration reforms and jeopardizing the education system as we know it.
 While social media users and pundits around the globe rightfully decry threats to signature Obama-era accomplishments such as the administration’s commitment to clean energy and the Affordable Care Act, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and her department have been quietly undoing much of his educational legacy.
 In her recent move to rewrite policy that protects students from for-profit colleges, DeVos’ actions harm, rather than help, students. The Borrower Defense to Repaying, a policy originally expected to take effect July 1, reimbursed students who fell prey to schools that used “illegal or deceptive practices to encourage the students to borrow debt to attend the school.” Just last week, DeVos announced that the Department of Education will temporarily freeze this program of debt relief among students, in an effort to revise and improve the regulations. 
However, this decision would only add to students’ debt burden. Furthermore, the Department of Education aims for a regulatory reset with The Gainful Employment — a rule that ensured that the 70 percent of bachelor’s degree recipients who graduated with a diploma and debt could pay back student loans in a timely fashion. 
To receive federal aid, Obama’s Department of Education required colleges to ensure that the loan payments of the average student loan borrower did not surpass 20 percent of student discretionary income or 8 percent of their total earnings.  Despite the imperfect nature of these Obama policies, student advocates widely lauded these efforts, and thus spoke out en masse to condemn these sudden policy changes.
 DeVos justified the measures of the Trump Administration in a released memo: “Unfortunately, last year’s rulemaking effort missed an opportunity to get it right. The result is a muddled process that’s unfair to students and schools, and puts taxpayers on the hook for significant costs.” 
Yet her unsubstantiated words are a part of a greater façade unfolding in Washington, D.C.: the privatization of our education. With nearly 90 percent of U.S. students enrolled in public pre-K through 12th grade schools, Secretary DeVos strives to devote an inordinate amount of time, energy and money to private schools. 
To double down on private schools, DeVos seeks to expand the use of school vouchers, which essentially provide a stipend for families to enroll their student in a private school.  Much like housing policies that move a small number of poor families into rich neighborhoods to combat inequality, school vouchers strive to lift some students from public to private schools.
But instead of ensuring that every child receives equal opportunity to a quality education, the nature of this system perpetuates inequality.  Take for example the state of Indiana, where then governor and now Vice President Mike Pence expanded the voucher program to the point where more than half of recipient students had no record of ever attending a public school, meaning that the state was subsidizing students to attend private school who were never planning to go the public route. 
More suburban and affluent families were benefiting, rather than the worthier demographic of low-income families. Even worse, vouchers in large numbers steer more students away from
public schools, which lose millions in funding as they still must foot fixed costs such as heating and lighting of buildings, even as student enrollment decreases.
 With the recently unveiled federal budget, opportunities for inequity continue to grow. On top of cutting 13 percent of the Department of Education’s funding ($9 billion) and gutting 20-plus education initiatives, such as after-school programs for low-income students, the Trump administration seeks to devote $1.4 billion to the school choice cause. 
School choice, under this administration’s vision, expands charter schools without government oversight, reducing legal accountability and educational regulations in schools, potentially providing children from low-income areas with a lower quality education. Taxpayer money would go to charter schools, which will spend the funds at their own discretion. Even worse, the Department of Education has yet to promise that private schools that discriminate against students will be ineligible for funding.
This administration has demonstrated that it prioritizes school choice and privatized education over accessibility, affordability and equality for the majority of students.
Secretary DeVos is challenging more than policies — she’s challenging principles. In an age of talking out of both sides of one’s mouth, DeVos’ ideological consistency and passion may  be refreshing to some, but her policies pose  a major threat to American students. 
At a time when our country must double down on investing in students at an early age and dismantling barriers to success, the Department of Education’s actions show an institutional failure to support students and their aspirations for equal education.

A huge incentive for a larger price tag on private universities is smaller class sizes and a higher student-professor ratio. Yet at universities across the nation, students find themselves in general education or introductory classes of 100 students or more. Not only can these classes scare students away from subjects they might otherwise excel at, but the students also do not absorb information in the same way that they could in a small class setting. For this reason, universities with the resources of a school as large as USC, should continue to make progress to introduce active-learning techniques to replace large lecture-style classes. 
In recent years, USC has made an active effort to restructure the courses that students take, especially during their freshman year. These have included the recent reform of the general education courses, with GE seminars which are capped at 19 students, two-unit freshman seminars and the expansion of the Thematic Option program. 
USC has worked toward creating a more intimate learning environment that has the resources and opportunities of a large research university. Students are often pleasantly surprised that a school with the undergraduate size of USC can provide these small classes. However, general education courses, which USC requires quite a few of, remain predominantly large and
lecture hall-style. 
According to a study done by the National Academy of Sciences, “undergraduate students in classes with traditional stand-and-deliver lectures are 1.5 times more likely to fail than students in classes that use more stimulating, active learning methods.”
In an article from the University of Vermont, Dr. Charles Prober, senior associate dean for medical education at Stanford University said, “Even if we [have] the best lecturer in the world, the number of students who choose that [educational] delivery method is low.” 
When the professor likely doesn’t know their name and they can easily attain notes from peers, many students fail to see the value in attending these classes. While some professors have been successful at facilitating conversation and student participation in these type of classes, the content of other classes inhibits the discussion and project-based learning for which experts have advocated. 
Physicist and education professor at Stanford University Carl Wieman describes active learning as a “focus on projects and problems.” Weiman said he “orients his philosophy around helping students learn how to ‘think’ inside a particular scientific discipline.” 
Lecture-style classes have been largely centered around memorization and templates, rather than absorption and critical thinking. This style of teaching limits discussion and the development of critical thinking skills that shape the intellectual curiosity and abilities of students. 
At a school that prides itself on students’ pre-professional excellence, USC has made a significant and successful effort to encourage students to explore courses and subjects outside of their schools. The general education program is absolutely essential to this. 
According to the University of Laverne, 50 to 70 percent of students will change their major at least once, and having a general education curriculum allows students to take other courses without feeling like they are wasting units. However, the general education structure can continue to be reformed to ensure that students are absorbing the same amount of information, whether it be an intro class or an upper division seminar. GEs should not be seen as just a hurdle to get to the interesting and relevant classes — even if a GE is not in a student’s chosen academic path, it should still be useful. 
USC has the resources to invest in the restructuring of the curriculum, and will find itself at the cutting edge of education if it revitalizes the current archaic system. The changes that have been made thus far have proven to be effective and popular among students. Integrating more innovative teaching techniques will only further the University’s momentum in recruiting high-performing students. New revolutionary classrooms will make strides in preparing students for the real world, rather than teaching them how to slide under the professor’s radar.
