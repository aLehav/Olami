When Andrew Brilliant stepped onto campus for the first time, he had no idea that he wanted to help student entrepreneurs. So when Brilliant, a sophomore majoring in business administration, met Bhav Singh, the two decided to create a venture club called WorkBenchSC.
“WorkBenchSC is an environment and an opportunity for students with ideas for companies to grow and gain resources, as well as have a few leadership opportunities and expand their network,” said Brilliant, the club’s director of marketing. 
Singh, a junior majoring in computer science, had always wanted to find a way to support student entrepreneurs. Growing up, he had fond memories of his family’s business and wanted to help foster that same spirit in others.
“General members” of the club have opportunities to attend networking events and speaker events, where the club invites venture capitalists and CEOs to give career advice and discuss the industry. Members with start-up ideas receive mentorships, connections and attention to help them facilitate their proposals from mere ideas to concrete kickstarters. 
While there are many student-run organizations on campus dedicated to the entrepreneurship and business fields, Brilliant said WorkBenchSC stands out because of its organizational values and focus on membership. 
Brilliant said the venture studio prioritizes its members with a persona-based framework that focuses on factors such as soft skills and tenacity rather than GPA and work experience. He said WorkBench allows passionate students with no business experience to kickstart their own ideas.
“There’s an old resume-based process that doesn’t focus on persona and the personality of a person, so we’re implementing that and we’re creating a solution to that,” said Singh, the club’s president. “So that we can create this environment that actually fosters new ideas.” 
The club hopes to provide professional and academic resources that are often hard to obtain and are often dependent on maintaining a certain GPA or having certain accomplishments. 
However, the founders believe that WorkBenchSC is only a start. The club finds people with business ideas and connects them with others with experience to guide them. 
“Our club wants to have these people who only have ideas and probably don’t have the monetary or the financial ability to just get their initial funding and to be able to kickstart their own company,” said Ruiqi Li, a sophomore majoring in business and cinematic arts. 
As the director of company relations, Li focuses on networking and reaches out to executives to have them serve as mentors for club members, as their industry knowledge on topics such as    funding, branding and manufacturing is invaluable. 
WorkBenchSC will hold mentoring workshops to teach students networking skills and helps them find initial funding for their businesses.

Anette Recinos said she was drawn to cannabis during her undergraduate years in the Bay Area after experiencing anxiety in college.
“I was going through kind of a tough time,” Recinos recalled. “It’s that time when you’re trying to find yourself, and you have no idea what your identity is. You get anxious about everything.”
Recinos, a graduate student in the Iovine and Young Academy, realized that even though cannabis helped her, there was still a stigma and lack of information around it which prevented other people from reaping its benefits. So, she decided to launch Cannaclub, a student organization focused on educating, advocating and providing opportunities for students within the cannabis space.
“I just saw that there was a need to actually educate students on everything having to do with cannabis,” Recinos said. “It’s not just about smoking it. There’s a lot of science behind it; there’s a lot of culture and societal factors around it.”
After turning to the Bay Area’s rich cannabis scene to ease her stress, Recinos said she realized more students should be educated on the medicinal properties of pot and thus began working in the industry in 2014 by          co-founding cannabis brand Ladybug.
“Most of the research shows that [cannabis] helps for these types of ailments [like epilepsy and cancer],” Recinos said. “I think there’s still that stigma where people think that if you smoke weed, you’re just a lazy stoner just on the couch eating Doritos, but it’s really not that.”
Recinos said the club’s primary goals are to educate students on safe cannabis practices and the benefits of pot along with creating a community where students can network, find volunteer and job positions, and have a platform to express their ideas to those in the industry.
“I think [cannabis] really does help people, and that’s why I’m a part of it, and that’s why I want to educate students on it,” Recinos said. “That you have to be responsible with it.”
While the club is in its beginning stages, recently gaining recognition from the University and a fresh executive board, Recinos said it is looking to create more opportunities for students by hosting events like speaker panels, networking mixers and other social events where members can mingle with the community.
Recinos sought the help of Maha Haq, former president of the UCLA chapter of Cannaclub and original founder of Cannaclub, which is now at 11 college campuses, to set up USC’s chapter.
Haq, who is a 2019 graduate of UCLA, started working in the cannabis industry when she was 18 as a budtender at a medical dispensary. After multiple rejections from UCLA’s administration because recreational marijuana hadn’t been legalized in California yet, Haq said the club was approved in 2018.
“We want to educate our students, as well as anyone else that we can educate,” Haq said. “We want to advocate for the right things within the cannabis space, so advocating for social equity or advocating for good practices in cannabis businesses, and then opportunities: We want to share job opportunities or really anything for students who are trying to break into the space.”
Haq said she values the partnership that has developed between the USC and UCLA chapters of the club and has worked with Recinos to standardize the Cannaclub’s constitution and bylaws to make sure the club could be easily approved by other university administrators.
“The best part of USC and UCLA Cannaclub chapters is that we get to work a lot together and collaborate,” Haq said. “The L.A. market for cannabis is huge [and] has huge potential, as well.” 
Recinos said the two often joke about the universities’ intense rivalry.
“We’re kind of collaborating, and we kind of have a running joke that weed has brought us together,” Recinos said.
Associate Dean of Research at the School of Social Work Charles Kaplan, who is the faculty adviser for Cannaclub and has worked with another adviser for the club, Director of the UCLA Cannabis Research Initiative Jeff Chen, said he wanted to support Recinos in engaging students with cannabis research. 
“Instead of just relying on the faculty and the administration to do it, if the students are really interested, let’s work with the students,” Kaplan said. “And that’s why I said ‘Well, I know about cannabis, I have a good network all over the world on cannabis, I’ve done research in it, so if I could help the students to have a good program that’s comparable, and even better than UCLA, then let’s do it.’”
Recinos said she was initially concerned about potential pushback from the administration because she didn’t know the culture of the student body or if people would be interested in a cannabis club. But the approval process went smoothly, with the University’s only stipulation being that pot would not be consumed on campus.
The executive board has attended conferences like CannMed, which hosts talks with leaders in the cannabis industry — such as 2019 keynote speaker “Father of Cannabis Research” Raphael Mechoulam, who discovered tetrahydrocannabinol, the main psychoactive compound in cannabis — to make themselves known to companies.
“A lot of companies really are happy to work with us because we’re the next generation of not only consumers, but business owners, leaders in the space, and I think they see the value in that,” Recinos said.
Cannaclub has partnered with Nail Garden and LYT Delivery for member discounts on cannabis services, and the club hopes to continue expanding partnerships through brand ambassadors or sponsorships. 
Recinos said she’s optimistic about the change Cannaclub can bring to USC and other campuses across the country.
“When I came to USC, I know I wanted to do something here. I know I kind of wanted to leave a little piece of me behind,” Recinos said. “In history, a lot of change has happened through students, so even just creating a student movement around cannabis is going to be a good foundation for that change.”
Kaplan said he believes with legalization efforts gaining ground across the country, clubs like Cannaclub can open doors for educational conversations about pot’s complexities and potential benefits.
“I understand that these clubs are springing up at other universities, not only in California,” Kaplan said. “So it’s sort of like a national movement that’s going on that’s tied to students and student interest, which I think should be the primary driver of this … This is a club that is promoting knowledge, promoting education and outreach to the community.”

USC freshman Ryder Jackson dominated his competition at the 63rd Annual Southern California Intercollegiate Championships Thursday through Sunday. Jackson secured the doubles title and was a finalist in the main singles draw. 
Jackson and his partner sophomore Bradley Frye — the No. 1-seeded pair in the tournament — made an impressive run in the main doubles draw, capturing the championship 8-5 against the No. 2 Arizona State duo of junior William Kirkman and senior Makey Rakotomalala. The title capped off a commanding tournament for the duo, which did not allow its opponents to win more than five games in any match.
Jackson’s success carried over to the singles draw as the No. 4 seed reached the finals in a matchup against Arizona junior Filip Malbasic. Jackson dealt with cramps early on in his first-round match against BYU freshman Jack Barnett, yet he willed his way through the pain en route to a 6-3, 6-7, 6-3 victory. Jackson would later upset the top-seeded Alex Holmgren of San Diego in the semifinals 6-3, 6-7, 6-4. 
Jackson ultimately fell to Malbasic in an enduring three-set match 4-6, 6-4, 6-0. Although he came up short of a singles title, Jackson’s performance was especially promising given that it is only his first year with the program.
“He fought really hard, and I was really just impressed with his resiliency and determination to keep pushing on through,” head coach Brett Masi said. “He beat some darn good players along the way. [It] just shows that he is another valuable asset that we have on our team this year.”
While he’s only a freshman, Jackson could be a major contributor for the team as the season progresses toward conference play.
“He’s beaten some really good players this fall, and this shows … that he can play with the best,” Masi said. “He just has to iron some things with his body, but he’s going to be right there with the rest of the guys serving us ahead.”
Elsewhere, multiple Trojans competed this past weekend in the Oracle ITA Fall National Championships in Newport Beach, Calif. No. 8 junior Daniel Cukierman came into the tournament intending to earn a championship win after losing in the singles final the previous year. 
The No. 4-seeded Cukierman fell in the quarterfinals to senior Valentin Vacherot of Texas A&M in a tight three-set match 6-4, 3-6, 6-4.
Although Cukierman came up short, this marks his only loss of the entire fall season, and he could still fall within the top 10 singles players in the country this spring.
Masi said his players’ early success will help them build momentum and confidence heading into the latter half of the season.
“While it is great to have a lot of success this fall, at the end of the day these guys know, and I know that it means nothing if we can’t finish come the spring season,” he said.
The Trojans’ first team match will be Saturday, Jan. 25, when they host UNC Wilmington at Marks Stadium.

Tyler, the Creator’s eighth annual Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival went off this weekend on the Dodger Stadium grounds without a hitch, except for the controversial reveal of the festival’s surprise headliner as Drake. Complete with three separate stages of high-profile musical guests and a multitude of amusement park rides, Flog Gnaw elevated the traditional music festival experience.
Camp Flog Gnaw, which used to be known as the OFWGKTA Carnival, originated at the height of Odd Future, the internet rap collective that spawned not only Tyler, but Frank Ocean, Earl Sweatshirt, The Internet and more. 
Maintaining its roots in Odd Future culture, the festival still features performances each year from nearly every original member of the group. One of the most noteworthy of these was by Mike G, who brought the heat to the Gnaw Stage, even in the 87-degree weather.
“The experience gets bigger and better [every year], the people grow, get more diverse. It’s just great to see every time, especially since the beginning,” Mike told the Daily Trojan.
Despite last year’s move from Exposition Park to the current venue, this year’s festival sold out with three days to spare. With hoards gathered at each stage and long wait times for rides, it would be hard to characterize the event as anything but rowdy.
“This year, similar to last year, [is] definitely a little chaotic because it’s at Dodger Stadium,” said Leila Kashfi, a senior majoring in business administration. “[There is] a lot of running around and it’s not flat, so that already tires you out a lot. Obviously the capacity is so much bigger than it is [at Exposition Park], so it’s overwhelming for sure.”
One of the main attractions of the first day was Tyler, the Creator’s headlining set on the Camp Stage. While he mostly performed songs from “Igor,” he interspersed older cuts like “She” and “Tamale” into his show. Wearing a two-piece suit in a color palette resembling spumoni, Tyler was visually commanding as he performed. Whether he was playing piano or standing motionless and expressionless — as he did for multiple minutes when he first walked out to “Igor’s Theme” — the audience was captivated.
“I wanna thank y’all for coming out tonight,” Tyler told the crowd. “It’s year eight. I built this from the ground up with a great team. I don’t ride nobody’s waves, and I own my shit.”
After an hour onstage, Tyler took a bow and began to exit. Before doing so, he turned around to flash a smile over his shoulder at fans chanting his name.
Day Two was even more eventful than Day One. Jaden Smith made surprise appearances during both Willow Smith’s and Taco’s sets. GoldLink brought out his recent tour partner, Tyler himself, for their collab “U Say” before teasing an upcoming album in the works with fellow DMV rapper Pusha T. Nearly every member of Odd Future could be spotted sitting in front of the barricade of the Gnaw Stage while Earl Sweatshirt performed. YG brought out Tyga, DJ Mustard and a mariachi band for “Go Loko” after bringing Stormi Daniels onstage for an elaborate lead-in to “Fuck Donald Trump.”
“Day Two was so much better,” said Emily Tandy, a freshman majoring in human biology who attended the festival. “The vibe was different, the crowd was different … everyone was super excited for the special guests.”
Since the lineup was announced back in August, fans have speculated about who would headline the festival’s second day since the slot was billed simply as “???.” Rumors swirled that the notoriously elusive Frank Ocean would resurface for a rare performance, given both his close friendship with Tyler and the mystery shrouding the artist. At 10 p.m. Sunday, Tyler took the stage for the grand reveal.
“I’m gonna keep this short and sweet and all,” Tyler said. “Can I bring a couple friends out?”
With that, A$AP Rocky jumped out onstage to “LPFJ2” and lit the audience up with “Praise the Lord.” Afterward, Lil Uzi Vert came on, descending into the crowd to perform “Money Longer” and “Sanguine Paradise.” 
“Can I bring another friend out?” Tyler asked, eliciting cheers from the audience.
Drake’s “Started From the Bottom” began to play overhead and the Canadian superstar took the stage.
“Tyler told me this shit was gonna be crazy,” Drake told the audience. “This is Flog Gnaw, one of one.”
After his second song, Gucci Mane’s “Both,” Drake asked the audience for permission to perform longer than his allotted “two or three songs.” He then played tracks from “Scorpion” and “More Life” before launching into some older material.
“These next two songs I’m about to do, I haven’t done in a very long time,” Drake said. “They’re dedicated to my brother [Tyler] cause he asked me to do them tonight … This right here, by special request, first time in a lot of years,” he said before playing “Feel No Ways” and “Wu-Tang Forever.”
Shortly after, Drake once again checked in with the audience.
“Like I said, I’m here for you tonight,” he said. “If you wanna keep going, I will keep going tonight, what’s up?”
The crowd, still unsure whether or not Tyler would bring out another friend, gave a mixed response. Some fans cheered, while others booed and shouted “No.”
“It’s been love, I love y’all. I go by the name of Drake, thank you for having me,” he said as he left the stage.
Only 20 minutes after it began, the most anticipated act of the weekend was over. Fans became increasingly upset as the house lights came on and security began ushering people toward the exits. The cheers of “We want Frank” that had been erupting sporadically over the past hour — including during Drake’s set — picked up again but fell on deaf ears.
“Thanks for coming, get home safe,” read a message that appeared on the stage screen soon after Drake finished. 
Disgruntled fans began to boo and at least one threw a water bottle on the stage. Although he’s the most commercially successful rapper in the genre’s history, many fans felt Drake’s appearance at Camp Flog Gnaw was unwelcomed because his personal brand is too mainstream, and therefore not in line with that of the festival, which caters to a more specific demographic.
“Having Drake as the headliner is kind of antithetical to everything Odd Future stands for,” said Rahul Manwani, a freshman majoring in animation and digital arts who attended the festival. “Odd Future was a group of misfits and weirdos at the very beginning and each of them has built their career on being extremely unique … It’s a sell-out move.”
But, not everyone felt let down by the surprise performances.
“I wanted Frank to come out but I thought it was a great set,” said James Sinigalliano, a freshman majoring in piano performance who attended the festival. “I thought people booing was kind of disrespectful.”
Regardless of how others received his surprise, Tyler stood by the call to bring out Drake. He took the backlash with a grain of salt and shared a message on Twitter the next morning.
“I thought bringing one of the biggest artist on the fucking planet to a music festival was fire! But flipside, a lil tone deaf knowing the specific crowd it drew,” Tyler tweeted. “Some created a narrative in their head and acted out like assholes when it didn’t come true and I don’t fuck with that.”
Tyler changed his Twitter bio to “embarrassed by fans right now.”
Aside from the final performance, Tyler curated a weekend-long experience tailored specifically to a niche demographic of fans. The festival was successful as a whole and can likely only grow from here.

“Go into the woods and scream as loud as you can,” Alec (Martin Starr), a well-meaning rehab counselor tells Otis (Lucas Hedges), early on in “Honey Boy.” Otis heeds the advice and we later see him out in the forest yelling, letting it all out, intercut with Otis as a child (Noah Jupe) doing the same thing. It’s pure catharsis — a microcosm of “Honey Boy” as a whole.
Written by Shia LaBeouf, “Honey Boy” is a semi-autobiographical film about LaBeouf (under the pseudonym Otis) and his relationship with his father. It’s told through two timelines — Otis as an adult, in a rehab center due to his struggles with alcoholism and 12-year-old Otis living with his father and working as a child actor. Both timelines are united by Otis attempting to navigate his rocky relationship with his abusive father, who is played by LaBeouf himself.
LaBeouf wrote the script for the film while in rehab and, rumor has it, he shopped it around anonymously. Director Alma Har’el eventually picked it up and persuaded LaBeouf, who had taken a step away from acting, to come back to play his father. It’s clear that “Honey Boy” is an intensely personal project and that’s where its greatest strengths lie. There are moments of intense empathy and quiet beauty littered throughout the film, mostly due to stellar performances. 
LaBeouf brings his all to his role and plays all the complex emotions, both on a textual and metatextual level, exceedingly well. He harnesses a type of roughness and hypermasculinity to a dazzling effect. Jupe, younger Otis, is fantastic as well, combining childlike naivete and precociousness, mutating it into a child forced to grow up too soon. There’s a particularly interesting scene with the girl next door, played by FKA twigs, performing a complex, intimate dance together. There is very little dialogue in the sequence, which makes it all the more impressive — the performances are all facial expression and movement, allowing both of them to convey abstract emotions through pure physicality.
Har’el’s direction is great as well. The film opens on an incredibly edited whirlwind of a sequence, taking the viewer through multiple moments in Otis’ life, teaching you about the character quickly and efficiently. She commands an empathetic camera, often moving with the characters, putting you directly in their headspace as they reveal themselves to you. Har’el also creates a very unique mood, again connected to how personal this story is. It’s difficult to put into words, but it feels as if she creates another world where the rules are just a little bit different.
While the personal nature of the film yields some incredible moments, it is also the film’s greatest flaw. “Honey Boy” is liberating, but it isn’t much else. It feels like verite in a sense because there is little to propel the story forward. There’s conflict and things happen, but there is a noticeable lack of meaningful growth. That could partly be due to some dissonance between the two timelines — we spend the majority of our time witnessing the father-son relationship from the younger perspective, so the older Otis in rehab remains underdeveloped. 
The film ultimately feels static for much of its (short) runtime, leading to an emotional disconnect. It was certainly impactful for LaBeouf, but that doesn’t necessarily translate to the audience, especially because it feels as if he’s simply releasing these emotions rather than meaningfully working through them. It’s more a depiction of his relationship with his father than it is a film about said relationship. 
“Honey Boy,” ultimately, is that scream in the forest. There is a moment of beauty. Release. Letting it all out even if you don’t know what exactly to make of it. It echoes against the trees, fading into the night sky. Going, going, gone.

On Saturday, beautiful Tuscaloosa, Ala., was host to the best game of this college football season. The No. 3 Alabama Crimson Tide hosted the No. 2 LSU Tigers in what many believed to be a mock playoff game between two of the SEC’s best.
The Crimson Tide had been riding a 31-game winning streak at Bryant-Denny Stadium before the Tigers came to town, adding to the tension of a potential loser-goes-home scenario for the elusive College Football Playoff. A head-to-head matchup of Heisman frontrunners in LSU senior quarterback Joe Burrow and Alabama junior quarterback Tua Tagovailoa also set the stage for a potential Trophy-winning game between the two. 
Everything was on the line this game and, boy, did it deliver.
The Tigers jumped out to an early lead and quieted the usually rowdy Crimson Tide home crowd, going into halftime with a dominant 33-13 advantage. Tagovailoa and the Tide fought back in the second half, making it a one-score game late in the fourth quarter. Still, it was the Tigers who held on for victory, and the college football world was set ablaze accordingly.
You’d think a rare home loss would put the spotlight squarely on Alabama head coach Nick Saban, but it was LSU head coach Ed Orgeron who stole the show and the hearts of viewers around the country with the career-defining victory.
Orgeron, or “Coach O” as he’s affectionately known throughout college football, might be the most likeable figure at the head coaching position. His gruff Southern Louisiana accent has quickly made him a beloved icon among fans and analysts alike, but it’s his warm, egoless coaching philosophy that sets Orgeron apart from the rest of college football’s elite. 
While Orgeron has maintained a player-friendly reputation since his career began, it’s become a trademark of sorts for the deep-voiced, barrel-chested Cajun who began his college football career as a reserve for LSU before transferring to Louisiana’s Northwestern State University. Since then, he’s brought his blue-collar, family and football first philosophy to an impressive line of stops that includes the University of Miami, the University of Mississippi and — yup, you guessed it — USC.
As a young man, Orgeron served as the defensive line coach for several impressive University of Miami teams that produced players such as Cortez Kennedy, Russell Maryland and Warren Sapp. There, Orgeron became well-known as a coach unafraid to take his shirt off and wrestle any players who challenged him as the strongest guy in the locker room. (Rumor has it he hasn’t engaged in this behavior in several years, but I’ll bet you can find answers in the USC athletics department if you look hard enough.)
Sadly, Orgeron didn’t last long as USC’s interim coach following the firing of *gasp* the infamous Lane Kiffin in 2013. He went 6-2 to finish out the season as head coach of the Trojans and resigned from the program after the hiring of *gasp again* former Washington head coach Steve Sarkisian. 
Since then, it’s been a slow ascent up the coaching hierarchy at LSU for Orgeron, who accepted the position of defensive line coach in 2015 under head coach Les Miles. When Miles was fired in 2016 following a loss to Auburn, Orgeron was announced interim coach for his home state’s flagship football program. And, after LSU closed the season with an impressive 6-2 stretch under Orgeron (sound familiar?), the administration dropped the “interim” tag and promoted Orgeron to full-time head coach. 
Now, looking back, it’s not hard to see that the school made the right decision. Orgeron has built a program on tough love and hard work down in Baton Rouge, and it will likely result in a playoff berth and Heisman candidate for the hungry Tigers’ team. 
“I’m so happy for the state of Louisiana,” Orgeron said following Saturday’s win over the Tide. “We’re bringing a national championship back to the state of Louisiana.”
In this emotional postgame interview, Orgeron doesn’t take credit or mention himself even once. He gives all the praise to his players and all the spoils to his home state. If that isn’t pure class, then I don’t know what is.
Also, I’m sorry to say this to USC fans but, after sobbing (correction: I was sobbing; he was fighting back tears) along with Coach O following his Tigers’ victory over the Crimson Tide, it’s safe to say he’s at the right place. We had our shot, and we decided he wasn’t the right fit. We weren’t wrong.
He and his college football-loving heart are right where they belong, right in the bayous of Southern Louisiana.

“I’ma go hella off for this,” I heard a boy a tad younger than me say as we approached the Toyota Stage at Tropicália Saturday.
By his word choice, it’d be fair to assume that a modern artist was about to hit the stage. But no, we were about to see Paquita la del Barrio, the Mexican ranchera singer, bright in her sky blue, sparkly outfit and accompanied by a full mariachi band.
Like the kid, I was also ready to “go off” with Paquita as she sang her women-empowering and men-hating tracks “Tres Veces Te Engañe” and “Rata de Dos Patas.” 
“Me estás oyendo, inútil?” Paquita said to which the crowd responded with roars. We felt connected even if we weren’t the inútil she was referring to.
The first day of Tropicália featured a wide array of classic, Latinx acts including rock bands Zoé, Caifanes, Hombres G and Enanitos Verdes along with — what I call — Mexican as fuck bandas such as Los Cadetes de Linares, Los Tigres del Norte and Los Rieleros del Norte at the Pomona Fairplex. The young crowd intermingled with attendees around my parents’ ages as they listened to the music of nuestra tierra. The place was packed.
Nostalgia blared from all of the speakers and I unavoidably reminisced about my parents and their youth. 
As I danced to the “currucús” of “El Palomito” by Los Cadetes de Linares, I remembered the stories my mom would tell me of her and her sisters escaping their house to go to el baile as a band visited town. She says the dirt would rise as the crocodile-skin boots moved around and danced to the music. It was always so fun for her — and now, I felt the same way.
What made Tropicália work so well — despite the older generation of music on the first night — was that it brought the nostalgia to us, here in the most Mexican region in the U.S. It allowed young people like me to reminisce about a place we never visited and dance to the music our families blasted as kids.
Tropicália perfectly encapsulated the first-generation Latinx American experience. It provided all the throwbacks while night two brought on the Latinx artists we’ve learned to love today, like Omar Apollo, Kali Uchis and Cuco.
Perhaps it was fitting that rock band Zoé performed some tracks off their latest album Aztlán, named after the mythical land of the Aztecas that Chicanx people have longed to return to or to reclaim. 
That was us that night: We were at a festival that celebrates our culture and our music miles away from the place our parents once left. We were reclaiming our history and allowing ourselves to be fully immersed in the music our families indoctrinated us with.
I couldn’t help but tear up as Los Tigres del Norte took the stage at the end of the night. “La Jaula de Oro” reminded me of my dad and how every day, he’d come home blasting his favorite tracks after a laborious day as a construction worker.
“Aunque la jaula sea de oro, no deja de ser prisión,” Los Tigres sing on the track. Even if the cage is golden, it’s still a prison. That’s what it’s like to be an undocumented immigrant in this country. And though my dad is back home in Santa Clara, I felt connected to him as I listened to Los Tigres sing along on the huge stage.
I realized that night that this music is as much mine as it is my dad’s and my tía’s and my mom’s. I’ve made these songs the soundtrack of life and I couldn’t be prouder to be enjoying that same music next to other young people like me.

On Nov. 11, the United States observes Veterans Day — the one day a year that is set aside to honor military veterans who have sacrificed so much to protect the nation and its citizens. As of 2018, there were 18.2 million living veterans who had served in at least one war in the U.S. 
In addition to offering Army, Navy and Air Force ROTC programs, USC admits student veterans from every branch of the military into its freshman and transfer classes every year. Despite a comprehensive relationship with the U.S. military, USC does not observe Veterans Day. 
Originally called “Armistice Day,” Veterans Day was first created in 1919 to celebrate the end of World War I in the U.S. This is why the holiday is celebrated on Nov. 11 every year: It is held in honor of the “11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month” of 1918, the end of the war. 
The U.S. government observes Veterans Day as one of 10 annual federal holidays, meaning all public schools in California have the day off. However, because USC is a private institution, the University is not required by law to observe the holiday. 
Although USC does not observe Veterans Day, for more than a century, the institution has supported the U.S. military. During World Wars I and II, USC served as a training school for people serving in the military. 
On Oct. 1, 1918, nearly 900 students were sworn into Students’ Army Training Corps on Bovard Field. From 1939 to 1945, USC placed barracks on campus to accommodate additional students in the naval preparatory flight cadet school and Army, Navy and Air Force programs. Since 1981, USC has been one of an estimated 60 institutions in the nation approved to host an Army, Navy and Air Force ROTC program. 
In addition to facilitating Army, Navy and Air Force training programs, USC leads in military-related research initiatives. In 1952, the USC Aviation Safety and Security program became the first aviation safety program at a major university. The Information Sciences Institute at USC launched in 1972 to support the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, developing state-of-the-art computing, information processing and communications technology. In 1999, The Institute for Creative Technology at USC was created to generate technologies for military leaders to improve their interpersonal communication and decision-making skills.
More recently, the Navy Trauma Training Center was created in 2002 with Los Angeles County and the Keck School of Medicine as the leading training site for expeditionary medicine in preparation for deployment abroad. After the events of 9/11, the University launched the National Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events — a national research academy that brings together policymakers and engineers to assist the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. In 2009, the School of Social Work established the Center for Innovation and Research on Veterans and Military Families with the purpose of educating policymakers on issues that impact veterans and their families. 
Evidently, USC has a long history of supporting the military through periods of both wartime and peace, in facilitating both training programs and research initiatives and in accommodating programs across a spectrum of USC schools in the undergraduate and graduate levels. Yet the school does not observe Veterans Day as a holiday. 
For an institution that has such a long-lasting and comprehensive relationship with the military, the University should have Veterans Day to honor the community that plays such an integral role in making USC the dynamic place it is today. According to the USC Military and Veterans Initiative, USC is a “leading institution” for veterans, so it is especially disheartening that the school does not observe Nov. 11 as a holiday. 
USC has to make a change — for a school that is a “leading institution” for veterans, USC needs to start leading by example and must observe Veterans Day.

Content warning: This article contains information regarding death and suicide. Students dealing with mental health concerns can walk into USC Student Health centers or contact the 24/7 phone line (213) 740-9355 for professional assistance.
“I want all of you here to know that you are loved, that you are seen, that you are heard, that you matter, that you belong, that you are not alone,” Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni told a crowd of 150 people gathered at Our Savior Parish late last month. 
Prayers, hymns and moments of silence filled every space in the room, as the community mourned the loss of a School of Cinematic Arts senior.  
On Sunday, Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman confirmed to the Daily Trojan that at least eight students have died in the last three months, compared to six during each of the last two academic years. Twelve students passed away during the 2016-17 academic year and four during the 2015-16 academic year.
Since the start of the year, the University community has been coping with these losses. 
On Saturday night, President Carol Folt and three other administrators addressed the high number of deaths this semester in a letter to the community.
“These student losses are devastating and heartbreaking for all of us,” they wrote. “People are searching for answers and information as we attempt to make sense of these terrible losses.”
Van Orman said that sending an email to the entire community was a change in strategy after speculation arose regarding the two most recent deaths.
“I think that the University leadership wanted to acknowledge to the community that knew that there had been two student deaths that we were trying to gather more information,” she said, adding that most of the deaths this semester have not been caused by suicide. “In these cases, we had no evidence that that was the case. And so to try to help kind of dispel some of the rumors and misinformation that was out there.”
While the University has not confirmed the nature of these deaths and some are currently being investigated, Van Orman said that three of the eight  have been caused by suicide. 
“We have no reason to think that the others were suicide,” Van Orman said.
Just two days before the start of classes in August, a freshman died on a freeway near campus. Following his death, the community was informed in an email from the University administration, urging students to seek guidance and support through several hotlines. 
Less than two weeks later, University administrators sent another campus-wide email about the death by suicide of a junior who majored in industrial and systems engineering who died by suicide in September. At the end of the email, the same hotlines and additional resources were listed.
The next night, a junior who majored in business of cinematic arts died near campus. That time, only a small portion of the campus received notice. One month later, two more students died. And just days before Trojan Family Weekend earlier this month, USC held the vigil in Our Savior Parish in honor of the SCA senior who died. 
“It’s not that we want to hide it, but we also don’t want to repeatedly send information to too many people who, maybe it isn’t in their community,” said Van Orman. “We want the people who are close to that person to have that information without the risk and the harm that it creates because of the large number of people in our community.”
But many students are still left with questions.
“It’s a conversation that should be universal, and I don’t think that the school [is] fazed at all and that’s super scary,” said Lauren Rothman, a junior majoring in film and television production, at the time. 
Dean of Religious Life Soni explained that there has been a rethinking of communication strategy due to the addition of a new communication team under the new University administration and wanting to make sure students’ safety and health is the priority.
“We’re in the process of evolving this and trying to figure out what the best way to provide the notifications is,” Van Orman added.
Additionally, Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp said the emails are sent to different members of the community  in compliance with the wishes of each students’ families and out of concern for community wellness.
“This is, in my estimation, a very complicated and difficult issue,” Crisp said. “At the same time, we have grave concerns about the evolving nature of some of the mental health concerns.”
Preventing more harm
Although three of the deaths have been confirmed suicides, the increased risk of self-harm due to contagion after each death has led the administration to look at the issue from a public health perspective, Crisp said.
“We have to … look at the causes, and trying to get at some of the causes and pressures that young people are feeling today and are experiencing on campuses to try to improve on the prevention side of mental health,” he said.
According to psychiatrist Victor Schwartz, data on college student suicides is difficult to come by because there is no organized model for collection. Schwartz is the chief medical officer at the Jed Foundation, an organization USC partnered with in Spring 2018 that helps universities improve their mental health programs.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports that suicide rates for students ages 15 to 19 have increased 76% from 2007 to 2017. Additionally, suicide rates for people ages 20 to 24 increased 36% from 2000 to 2017. 
In 2017, suicides were the second leading cause of death for people ages 15 to 24, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Once a campus has dealt with a death, there can be an increased risk of self-harm, known as contagion. Schwartz said universities experience suicide clusters, where news of a death impacts vulnerable individuals in a community who may or may not have known the victim. 
Campuses similar in size to USC typically see an estimated three suicides per year, Schwartz said. Because universities are self-contained communities, they are especially prone to contagion.
“While something like this is happening, it’s incumbent on the campus services to be reflective and thoughtful and active, [but] it’s also not necessarily the case that they’ve done anything wrong that resulted in this,” he said. “That said, they need to be vigilant and self-reflective and very careful in making sure there aren’t things that they could be doing that they haven’t.”
When a university experiences a cluster, widespread anxiety heightens, he said. This general sentiment may normalize suicidal thoughts or actions within a community.
Eloise Rollins-Fife, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies, said students have been paying close attention to these deaths. She does not feel like these events are normal.
“This isn’t a normal fact of university life … this is something that makes us feel crazy and there isn’t a dialogue between the administration and the students about what’s been going on,” she said. “And then it just feels like at any moment, another classmate could die.”
However, Van Orman said the University has to walk a fine line between informing the student community and avoiding the spread of misinformation.
“We share the information we have. We don’t want to hide anything,” Van Orman said. “But I also want to be really careful — I don’t want to say things that make people think I know when I don’t know.”
At a mental health forum hosted by Undergraduate Student Government last month, Soni explained that feelings of loneliness among students on campus, particularly when first-year students are transitioning into college life, can cause isolation and mental health challenges.
“The reality is that being in college is tough and can be a traumatic experience,” Soni said. “A normal college experience can be a traumatic experience, and no one ever tells us that.”
Seeking answers
Blake Wagner, a senior majoring in cinematic arts, critical studies, who lives with bipolar disorder, said he has felt frustrated with the campus’ wellness resources.
“It’s just deeply troubling to know that other students have gone through what I’ve gone through and not been given the resources that they need to survive,” Wagner said. “It just breaks my heart because I know that if it wasn’t for my friends and a few professors who really came through for me and offered support when I needed it, I don’t know if I’d still be in college right now. Because of my experiences suffering from mental health disorders, I don’t know if I’d be alive right now.”
Wagner also believes that listing resources at the bottom of these emails does not help students who do not feel comfortable using campus health facilities.
“It’s ridiculous to me that we’re getting emails with lists of contacts, people to reach out to,” Wagner said. “Ultimately, if you’ve had a bad experience with counseling services or you’ve been in crisis and USC hasn’t been there for you, now when you really need it, you’re not going to trust them.”
Lauren Rothman believes that while USC is trying to support students, it has room to improve its outreach.
“On a whole level as a university, I think they’re trying,” Rothman said. “I’m not proud of how [the University] has responded to these things when they’ve happened … but beyond the email about it and the email telling people to come to the vigil, I didn’t see any real response on a tangible level for somebody who didn’t know the person.”
Students at the School of Cinematic Arts have been some of the most active in demanding answers and voicing their concerns as two of the confirmed deaths have been of students at their school.
Krupa Naik, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies, said she will meet with SCA Dean Elizabeth Daley this week in hopes of planning a forum between students, faculty and administrators to discuss the handling of information regarding student deaths. 
She believes an open forum will allow students to air their concerns with how the announcements have been handled.
“Anger is a huge part of the grieving process, and it’s very easy to want to blame and point fingers, but it’s important to remember that we’re all on the same side and that nobody wants this,” Naik said. “But we don’t feel that as a student body. We don’t feel like the school was making an effort to make that known and to hear us.”

Correction: A previous version of this article reported that the two students who died by suicide in early September were both sophomores. They were juniors. The second student is a business of cinematic arts major, not a business administration major. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.
