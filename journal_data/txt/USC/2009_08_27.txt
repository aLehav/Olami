Former USC standout shortstop Grant Green is moving on to the next stage in his career after signing a contract with the Oakland Athletics.
The 21-year-old, selected 13th overall by the A’s in June, agreed to a deal that includes a $2.75 million signing bonus. Green reported for Arizona Fall League play Tuesday.

“It’s a good fit through and through,” Green said by phone Wednesday. “Me and my family, Scott Boras, my agent, we’re all extremely stoked about it and glad that it’s all over.”
Green hit a team-leading .374 last season for the Trojans. In his three-year career at USC, he hit .359 with 15 homers, 102 RBI and a school record-setting 20 triples.
At one point in February, he was projected by Baseball America to be picked as high as second overall after a summer at the Cape Cod Baseball League, in which he was named the most outstanding pro prospect. When his numbers slipped to start off the season, Green’s stock declined, but the A’s told him he was their top choice at shortstop all along.
The A’s are reputed around the league to have a keen eye when it comes to the draft. Billy Beane, Oakland’s general manager, was the primary subject of a New York Times best-seller, Moneyball, that took a behind-the-scenes look at the team’s 2002 draft.
“It was an honor to be picked by them,” Green said. “A lot of the guys that they’ve drafted throughout the years have gone on to be real good major leaguers, and it’s just an honor to be seen by the A’s organization as the top guy at that spot.”
Green said he and Boras agreed to terms with the Athletics’ brass “about 30 seconds” before the 9 p.m. deadline on Aug. 17.
Major League Baseball recommends that the 13th overall selection get $1.66 million. Brett Wallace, the 13th pick in 2008, signed for $1.84 million.
“It’s a fair deal,” Green said. “We were still over slot, which is what we wanted, and they knew that.”
Another former USC standout, right-handed pitcher Brad Boxberger, signed on deadline day with the Cincinnati Reds for $857,000. Boxberger had been drafted 43rd overall.
Catcher/pitcher Robert Stock, who shined in the second half of last season as a starting pitcher for the Trojans, has been playing catcher in the St. Louis Cardinals organization since agreeing to a deal in June.
Three other players from last year’s roster signed with MLB organizations: second baseman/catcher Hector Rabago, left-hander Anthony Vasquez and right-hander Daniel Cooper. Rabago went to the New York Yankees while Vasquez and Cooper both signed with the Seattle Mariners.

Success isn’t a right, it’s a privilege.
It is something that is earned, not merely handed over on a silver platter.
Remember that, because it is too often forgotten within the confines of this campus.
It’s impossible to fault anyone for thinking so, with double-digit win seasons and BCS bowl berths — and victories — becoming the norm. After seven straight seasons of 11 or more wins and seven straight BCS appearances, anything less is a major disappointment.
We’ve begun to feel as if we’re entitled to this success, as if it is our divine right to win football games at a remarkable pace.
But we have to step back, look at the grand scheme, and realize this: Success cannot be taken for granted.
It’s tough to get that point across to the USC fan base because of the last seven years, but it’s important to be reminded of this reality before it becomes too late.
And so I offer this as a reminder.
This past summer, I was one of the play-by-play announcers for the Bourne Braves of the Cape Cod Baseball League.
I entered the summer with this knowledge: Bourne had never won a championship, and the other nine franchises had.
The Braves were formed in 1988 after a decade and a half of absence from the Cape. The last time any team from the Bourne region of the Cape had won the league title was 1965, when a squad from Sagamore captured the championship.
It was evident everywhere.
In the CCBL Hall of Fame, each of the 10 teams has a display case; Bourne’s was noticeably emptier than any of the other nine. There was barely enough memorabilia to fill one display in Heritage Hall.
A quick check of the league record books reinforced this. Cotuit had won the title 14 times, YD three times since 2004, Wareham and Orleans twice each in this decade.
Bourne was nowhere to be found  — save for the column labeled “Runner Up.”
Sure, Bourne had been to the playoffs before, and in the past decade as well. But postseason success — which USC has become so accustomed to — was an elusive goal.
Yet the team set out to change that. The players seemed aware of the reality that Bourne wasn’t exactly title-town. As the season went along, it came together with one mission in mind: Delivering a championship to the title-starved Bourne faithful.
The wins began to pile up, and the fans began to pile in.
The buzz had been barely audible on June 29, when Braves center fielder Scott Woodward walked on a 3-2 pitch with two outs and the bases loaded in the bottom of the eighth to cap off a come-from-behind win.
The buzz was louder when the Braves scored two in the bottom of the ninth for a 4-3 walk off win over Falmouth.
It was even louder when Bourne starter Seth Maness took a perfect game into the eighth on July 26 and finished with a complete game, one-hit shutout.
It reached unseen levels when more than 2,800 people packed Doran Park, the home of the Braves, for game one of the semifinal series.
The faithful who had stuck by its team all season long saw eight-plus innings of lifeless baseball, with Orleans starter Jorge Reyes tossing 8.1 shutout inning and Bourne down 2-0.
But the desire to bring a title to Bourne was still there, and the Braves scored three runs in the bottom of the ninth for the improbable 3-2 win.
The buzz grew even more when 6,233 were on hand — a Doran Park record — to watch the Braves defeat Cotuit 15-5 in game one of the championship series.
And it peaked at an all-time high when, a day later, the Braves delivered the town its long sought-after championship with a 5-1 win at Cotuit in game two of the best-of-three.
It was a remarkable process to watch. Each victory built upon the previous one, and the wins piled up. The team and its fans were aware that each win needed to be earned.
A foundation was there from previous years, but each successive win solidified it until the final victory completed the construction — in form of the championship trophy that currently sits in the press box at Doran Park.
It’s a process that we at USC are largely unfamiliar with, because we’ve known nothing other than success.
That’s not to say you should temper your enthusiasm, or lower your expectations. Nor am I suggesting the USC faithful don’t appreciate each and every victory.
But it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that wins didn’t always pile into the Coliseum, that Heritage Hall wasn’t always full of the recently-earned hardware.
Every so often, those who follow the Cardinal and Gold need a reminder that this football empire wasn’t built in one year, and that winning is not a preordained right.
Let the story of the Bourne Braves serve as that reminder.

“Turnover Wednesday” was all about the status quo for USC’s quarterbacks.
With all eyes on redshirt sophomore Aaron Corp and true freshman Matt Barkley, both signal-callers played it safe. Neither one threw an interception, always a point of emphasis during the midweek practices.
Fleet-footed · Aaron Corp, known for his ability to move out of the pocket, is not fully recovered yet. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
Barkley took all of the first team reps, but the coaching staff tested Corp to see how his cracked left fibula was progressing.
“I didn’t see much of a change, but he didn’t have a fallout from yesterday,” USC coach Pete Carroll said. “The fact that he’s back out here again today is progress.”
Carroll said Corp’s mobility had not fully returned since the injury, citing one play during practice when Corp struggled to take off downfield.
“That was a situation where we would have loved to see him get out there and weave through the secondary a little bit,” he said. “But it’s clear that he’s under recovery and getting close.”
Corp’s mobility has been a point of emphasis throughout the spring and into the fall. As one of the best scramblers during Carroll’s time with USC, Corp has given USC’s offense a new dimension by improvising on broken plays.
Re-establishing that aspect of his game is a step Carroll is eager to see.
“We want to see that he’s confident and can run and escape and all that — he’s never played when he wasn’t like that,” Carroll said. “I’m reluctant to think that he’d be comfortable if he can’t run like he always has, so I don’t want to put him in a bad situation.”
Both Corp and Barkley struggled at times with the timing of their throws, but redshirt junior receiver Damian Williams said the defense held a distinct advantage because “they know all our plays.”
“It may look like the reads aren’t quite right,” Williams said. “But that’s due to planning and playing these guys for years now.“
u
The strongside defensive end position will be one of the spots the USC coaching staff will be following closely during Saturday’s scrimmage.
Redshirt freshmen Wes Horton and Nick Perry, and sophomore Malik Jackson are all vying to earn the starting nod at the position.
Sophomore Armond Armstead was expected to open the season as a starter but suffered a break in his left foot, sidelining him for six weeks.
Jackson moved over from the weakside position and could provide an additional pass-rushing boost opposite junior Everson Griffen.
“He does very well at Everson’s spot as well, but he’s got something about him where he’s kind of slippery when rushing the passer, so we don’t want to miss the opportunity to have them both on the field at the same time,” Carroll said of Jackson.

Four months after the NCAA combined its investigations of former USC star athletes Reggie Bush and O.J. Mayo into a single probe of USC’s athletic program, the movement appears to have done little in speeding up the decision-making process in what has turned into one of the longest NCAA investigations in recent memory.
The NCAA decided to combine the two probes into a larger investigation in April because the association wanted to review whether USC had shown a lack of institutional control, according to a report by the Los Angeles Times. But the combination has failed to bring the investigation to an end.
Still waiting · Almost three months after former coach Tim Floyd resigned, the NCAA has yet to make a ruling regarding the investigation. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
The NCAA began investigating Bush three years ago, examining whether the 2005 Heisman Trophy-winner and his family received improper benefits from a sports marketing agent while the running back attended USC. In 2008, similar allegations surfaced around NBA lottery pick Mayo, who only played one year for the Trojans, but was allegedly given gifts and money while he was recruited and playing for USC.
Under NCAA rules, an athlete may not accept money, gifts or any other benefits from an agent. Additionally, NCAA rules prohibit colleges from giving money or other benefits to athletes they are recruiting. Both Bush and Mayo have said they’ve done nothing wrong.
Further accusations against Mayo’s coach, Tim Floyd, made matters worse for USC. Louis Johnson, a former member of Mayo’s inner circle, said Floyd gave at least $1,000 to Rodney Guillory, the man who is said to have lavished Mayo with improper benefits during the player’s time with the Trojans.
Rather than deny the claim, Floyd stepped down as the Trojans’ basketball coach June 9 and was replaced by Kevin O’Neill.
Todd Dickey, USC senior vice president for administration, and Mike Garrett, USC athletic director, spoke about the investigation in June. They both said USC, the NCAA and the Pac-10 are working hard toward bringing this investigation to a close.
“We have no idea how long this investigation will continue, and no one is more anxious to bring this process to a conclusion more than we are,” Dickey said. “But we remain committed to get to the truth.”
“No one would like to get this information out and put this whole thing behind us more than I do,” Garrett said.
Dickey also pointed out that the main reason the public has not received much information lately is because NCAA rules state that it cannot comment on an ongoing investigation.
Because so little is known about how far along the investigation process is at this point, those on the outside are left to speculate on how much longer it will be until the NCAA makes a decision.
“I would have expected the NCAA to announce something before the end of summer, before school started, before the football season started,” said Anthony V. Salerno, Johnson’s lawyer who has been involved with the Mayo case since the allegations surfaced in 2008. “I don’t have any idea what’s taking them so long.”
Salerno added, “You would think at a certain point, it’s stale. Why bother to sanction a program that has already moved past things?”
The NCAA does not usually take more than a few months to make a decision with its investigations, making the USC investigation unique,.
In recent years, the NCAA has cracked down hard on universities such as Ohio State, Massachusetts and Alabama for using ineligible players, stripping teams of wins and championship runs. All of these cases were decided within months after allegations surfaced.
The most recent example occurred last week, when the NCAA ruled that Memphis vacate all 38 wins and its Final Four run from the 2007-2008 season because star guard Derrick Rose was an ineligible player.
The allegations regarding Rose’s eligibility surfaced in May, when the NCAA began investigating if another person took the guard’s SAT test for him and whether or not Rose’s brother received free transportation on the team’s charter plane.
Roughly three months later, a decision was made.
Roughly three years later, the jury is still out on USC.

When Brendt Barbur came to visit his sister in LA in 2003, “Los Angeles urban bike culture” was an oxymoron. But when the now 38- year-old bike-riding veteran stopped by a Fourth of July party in Silver Lake and saw five bikes locked up outside, he realized there is hope for LA yet.
“Five bikes means five people came on bikes,” Barbur said. “That’s a seed of something.”
Barbur has always had bikes on the brain. Growing up surrounded by the outdoor lifestyle in California, he became obsessed with bicycles at a very young age and grounded his roots in BMX. Constantly riding —and when asleep, dreaming about riding — Barbur switched bike types, but maintained a passion that followed him when he moved to New York City to pursue acting, theater and art.
In 2001, he was hit by a bus while riding through the city, which compelled him to create an event that would expose the public to New York City’s multifaceted bicycle culture through movies, music and art. Thus, the Bicycle Film Festival was born.
The first BFF was modest — movies made by friends, handmade trophies, live music and parties — but quickly grew as Barbur unleashed his idea of bicycle unity on other urban areas around the world.
“When we took it to San Francisco, it sold out shows,” Barbur said. “Then we went to Tokyo and London and those sold out, too. I thought to myself, ‘Hey, we’re onto something.’”
After seeing the impact his film festival had on the bike community’s growth in each new city, Barbur’s visits to LA fueled ambitions to bring his BFF to the capital of car culture.
“The urban bike culture [in LA] was so small, it was practically nonexistent,” Barbur said. “I felt that it would be a cool challenge.”
Over the next two years, he built friendships with local bike enthusiasts — like those associated with Los Angeles Eco-Village and non-profit co-op Bike Kitchen — and in 2005, BFFLA debuted at the historic Vine Theatre in Hollywood.
Now in its fourth year, the BFF LA has teamed up with Orange 20 Bikes on Melrose in East Hollywood, the LA County Bicycle Coalition, 42Below Vodka, HUF and others to present a five-day extravaganza of all things bicycle. Yesterday, there was a kickoff concert. Tonight, there will be an art gallery opening; tomorrow and Saturday are screenings of shorts, documentaries, cartoons and 1950s Japanese Keirin racing films; and Sunday is an all-day street party outside of Orange 20 with bike games, DJs and lots of two-wheel love.
Despite the undeniable increase of bicycle enthusiasm in LA over the last few years, the city’s often-disparate cycling communities can still benefit from an event like this. With urban sprawl spreading over nearly 1,000 square miles, it’s hard to unify Angelenos around anything except the Lakers; and bike riders here are more cliqued out than a high school quad at lunchtime. But BFF LA’s cross-town venues and come-one-come-all attitude is a chance for riders of different backgrounds and specific interests to connect with people from the opposite end of the city that they otherwise might not have ever met. Having a show in Eagle Rock, an art gallery on Melrose and screenings  Downtown forces people to organize rides and communicate with those outside their immediate circle of friends, opening a more fair dialogue for the future of LA’s bike culture as a whole.
Now hosted by 39 cities over a seven-month tour, BFF has a reputation for unifying all aspects of bicycle riding, regardless of form or style, through a celebration of all things art, regardless of medium. Tall bikes, mountain bikes, track bikes, scraper bikes, recumbent bikes, downhill bikes, 10 speeds, beach cruisers, BMX and even virtual reality bikes have all been highlighted at one point by the BFF.
“The festival is accomplishing what I want it to accomplish,” Barbur said. “It attracts all different kinds of people with different lifestyles that share a passion for bikes.”

At 10 a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 29, Michael Jackson will finally be buried.
It’s about time, especially after more than a month of public mourning that manifested itself in a larger-than-life mural of his visage on Vermont Avenue, a fashion spread in the Fall Fashion issue of Harper’s Bazaar and countless broadcasts of his decades of work.
At the end of the media tunnel is the burial at Forest Lawn-Glendale. It might sound ordinary to the non-Angelenos ear, but the mortuary- slash-cemetery is strongly attached to my native sense of death.
Forest Lawn was where everyone was buried, be it in the original Glendale location or the nine other memorial parks scattered throughout the state. As far as I know from my hazy childhood memories of paying respects to various passing relatives in Forest Lawns in Hollywood Hills, Covina Hills and Cypress, each facility looked the same. Each featured sprawling, green highlands and a central white plantation-style manor that housed the executive offices and mortuary of the grounds.
Forest Lawn, oddly enough, was also a place where schoolchildren visited historical reenactments and interacted with Betsy Ross (oooh!) and Father Junipero Serra (during mission report season, of course). Even odder still, my cousin graduated from high school at Forest Lawn-Hollywood Hills, and her class performed a choir version of Tupac Shakur’s “Changes.”
It seemed when I first heard the news that such a strange place did not deserve the King of Pop, who, in my mind and presumably the minds of his fans, belonged in the grandiose and unique Neverland where Jackson could escape the prying eyes of the world. It was an uninteresting branch of the McDonald’s of mortuaries; a sacrilege comparable to hanging a Van Gogh in a motel restroom.
Forest Lawn, after all, is a model of efficiency. The first facility to combine cemetery, mortuary, religious and floral services, Forest Lawn averages 21 services a day and 27 internments according to the memorial parks’ history book, Forest Lawn: The First 100 Years.
After some research and another visit to the memorial park, the grounds may not be such a plain resting ground after all.
Upon entering the facility through the wrought-iron entrance gates that are literally the largest ones in the world, visitors drive up to a booth where a staff member hands them a map of the grounds. It’s a little like an amusement park; the map is meticulously labeled, the surroundings impossibly manicured. This is no haunted, gloomy cemetery, but 290 acres of headstoneless greenery, lily-ponds, fountains, chapels, halls, a museum and an alarming amount of copycat art.
Yes, there’s even a looming, exact replica of Michelangelo’s “David” guarding the graves, which, despite having suffered twice from the region’s earthquakes, has been replaced and refurbished.
This was, after all, Forest Lawn founder Hubert Eaton’s manifestation of a cemetery not as a place that looked at death as a passage into darkness, but as a way to remember — a place for families. And in a way, Forest Lawn is that. Many Sundays, the roads are filled with SUVs and minivans with visitors in tow, ready to visit with Uncle Bob and have a picnic. The stroll through gardens of statues and murals are only part of the experience.
Some may think that this is blasphemy but, like Disneyland and other spectacles, the experience of the memorial park was truly pioneered in Southern California and accepted into the culture. After all, for show biz, death can often mean the ultimate last shot of good publicity.
That’s not to say that celebrities immediately disappear post-funeral. Los Angeles also pays tribute to the famous dead with events such as Cinespia, where wine-loving, plaid-clad hipsters can stuff their faces while watching movies on the lawn of Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Stars buried on site are actors, directors and other talent associated with each film, which can be barely heard or seen beyond the rips of bongs and public displays of affection, which grow soggier with dew as the summer night progresses. It’s probably not the best way to respect the Los Angeles dead, but it’s an insight into death culture here.
When death does come, Angelenos are all the same. We all have to rest somewhere, and for some celebrities, that means a quiet burial in an upstate rancho; for others, a grand affair at a vulgar yet ornate palm tree-lined cemetery like Hollywood Forever Cemetery. But for Jackson, it means a spot that has been in the county for more than 100 years, a place of rest for paupers and princes alike — a place familiar to the collective consciousness of a local culture that at once reviled and revered him, isolating him with headlines and hounding paparazzi.
On the day of what would be his 51st birthday, he is just like everyone else, part of the greenery on the hill. Perhaps that was just what he wanted.

In elementary school, my best friend went to space camp; I still resent her for it. My parents wouldn’t let me go — they claimed it was too dangerous and expensive — so I sat on my couch while my friend twirled around with the astronauts.
About 15 years later, I finally got to go to space camp. And though it was nothing like my friend’s adventurous experience, The Groundling’s newest stage show Space Camp was absolutely awe-inspiring.
Though the show, quite perplexingly, has nothing to do with space — the only reference to the title was director Mikey Day’s NASA shirt — it doesn’t take long to realize the two hours of sketch comedy will be just as zany as it would have been with the galactic theme.
If you are leery of live comedy  due to a slew of bad experiences with mediocre stand-up comedians or stale improv performances, do not worry: The Groundlings’ show offers 17 sketches, only three of which are improv, and all of which are hilarious.
Improvisational performances are notorious for being hit or miss. The Groundlings take care of this uncertainty by giving the audience prompts such as “act in the style of (playwright).” It doesn’t hurt that the crowd The Groundlings attracts is an older one, so the prompt is answered with responses like “David Mamet” and “Tennessee Williams” rather than the obvious “William Shakespeare.”
The other 14 shorts are scripted skits penned and performed by advanced Groundlings students. They cover subjects from gay coaches to TV networks, and spoof pop culture topics like The Terminator and The Facts of Life. While each one made my open-minded baby-boomer father cry with laughter, of your viewing partner is not so comfortable with slightly off-color humor, I advise you enroll in Space Camp another evening.
Though the skits are all fantastic, the actors make the show a unique and memorable experience. This can probably be credited to the fact that The Groundlings is not just a comedy troupe but also an improv and comedy school, and a renowned one at that.
The Groundlings School of Improvisation has been around since 1979, and began with only 17 students. Today, there are roughly 4,200 students learning the science of humor through the school’s four-step program, containing beginning, intermediate, lab and advanced courses. Once a student graduates the advanced course, he or she can be voted into the Sunday Company — the group that “nurtures” potential members.
An audition process is required to join the school, and auditions are free. If you do choose to audition, however, be prepared: you will be in the company of giants. The Groundlings’ roster of alumni includes comedic geniuses such as Will Ferrell, Cheryl Hines, Kathy Griffin and  Jon Lovitz, and most of the current students demonstrate reasonably similar potential.
Their no-holds-barred take on comedy allows them to delve fully into their characters, allowing them to execute each three-minute skit with focus, sculpting each sketch into something probably funnier than it should be. The actors, who also write the skits, are not afraid to make complete fools of themselves. Their willingness to do anything for the sake of comedy certainly shows.
One of the best parts about Space Camp is the anticipation, and the disorganized layout of skits actually works in the show’s favor.
If you are unhappy, uncomfortable or unable to stop laughing, not to fear. The Groundlings will take twists and turns through their diverse comedic stylings, and whether you love or hate a skit, the next one is almost guaranteed to rub you the right way.
The Groundlings offer something for everyone, and the show is just as entertaining as its prominent history suggests it should be. For a live show and an LA experience, you’ll probably enjoy more than an episode of Saturday Night Live, $18 per ticket isn’t half bad.
If for some reason you can’t make it out to its Melrose comedy den, you can find bits of the crew’s laugh-out-loud works on YouTube (if you haven’t seen it yet, “David Blaine Street Magic” is a must). If you can make it out, get ready for a delightful evening. You may not be at Space Camp, but surround yourself with The Groundlings and you can truly say you’re among the stars.

For the avid filmgoer, summer is defined by one word: blockbuster.
Ever since Steven Spielberg’s great white shark named Bruce bared his sharp set of teeth at audiences nationwide in July 1975, not one summer season has passed without the presence of record-shattering box office revenues, highly anticipated sequels and, in recent years, overly indulgent CGI displays.
Opposites attract · Adam stars Rose Byrne (left) and Hugh Dancy (right) as an unusual couple who first meet on the stairs of their apartment building. The film premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Alfred P. Sloan Prize and competed for the Grand Jury Prize. - Photo courtesy of Fox Searchlight Pictures
Though multiplexes are crowded with these mind-numbing, popcorn-munching flicks during the humidity-stricken months of July and August, art-houses flourish with Sundance Film Festival favorites. Though these films might be odd, slightly perplexing, and even emotionally brutal, they often make for early Academy Award contenders and a more intellectually satisfying experience than the typical multiplex fare.
If you were stranded in the ’burbs this summer and missed out on these cinematic gems, do not fear: the following independent films are still playing in theaters throughout Los Angeles.
Adam
Writer-director Max Meyer’s Adam is a simple film about a complicated man. The title character (Hugh Dancy) suffers from Asperger’s syndrome, a little-publicized disorder that falls under the autism spectrum. Though Adam is brilliant — especially when it comes to science and space exploration — he lives in his own sheltered world, unable to form relationships with others. This changes when Adam meets Beth, his new, beautiful neighbor. Meyer explores both the ups and downs of these two very different worlds colliding, painting a bittersweet portrait of a man living life slightly less normal than most. Dancy sheds his charming British accent for an unusual yet equally as charming staccato speech that, combined with his acute mannerisms, could garner him his first Oscar nomination.
Cold Souls
One part Being John Malkovich — an actor (Paul Giamatti) playing a heightened version of himself — and one part Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind — a strange, new-fangled contraption (a machine that extracts souls) that incites the film’s momentum — Cold Souls immediately appears to be penned by the master of offbeat cinema: Charlie Kaufman. Despite the uncanny similarities, Cold Souls is not a Kaufman piece, but the spawn of French writer-director Sophie Barthes. Though the film possesses a wild plot — after extracting his soul because it was weighing him down, Giamatti finds out that his soul has been stolen by an up-and-coming Russian actress — Barthes does not run away with her incredibly high concept, but rather stays true to her characters, crafting a  film that will indeed touch your soul.
Humpday
Though Judd Apatow and his male companions introduced the bromance into everyday moviespeak, it took a 43-year-old Seattle woman to validate the genre. Lynn Shelton’s Humpday — a Special Jury Prize winner at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival — follows two 30-something men who embark on a rather ambitious feat: make a gay porn art film with themselves as the stars.  In any other cinematic hands, Humpday would have turned out as irreverent as it sounds; Shelton’s sensibility in her approach, however, transcends the film from a cheap gimmick for laughs to an exploration of the male psyche, heterosexual relationships and homophobia in modern-day society. Humpday is not only a landmark film in the Mumblecore movement — a faction of American independent film characterized by extremely low-budget production, improvised scripts and a focus on intimate relationships — but an exemplary model for high-priced Hollywood comedies.
The Hurt Locker
As a slew of Iraq War-themed films have bombed at the box office in the past several years, studio executives and filmgoers are unanimously turned off by any notion of seeing the American military-occupied Middle East depicted on screen. This was the unfortunate scene onto which director Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break) had to launch The Hurt Locker, her latest explosive action film that documents the lives of a three-person US Army Explosive Ordinance Disposal unit stationed in Baghdad sometime in 2004. The film displays masterful direction by Bigelow, who understands tension is created within a scene through compression, timing and character. Bigelow’s perceptive direction combined with screenwriter Mark Boal’s well-crafted script produces a film that is ridden with paradoxes — objective but not heartless, realistic but not documentarian, hard-hitting but not over-the-top and yes, a war film not exactly about war.
Paper Heart
What do you do when you don’t believe in love? According to spunky comedienne Charlyne Yi, you travel the country, interview an assortment of eccentric couples and make a documentary. To an extent, that is Paper Heart — until you add alternative heartthrob Michael Cera into the equation.
Winner of the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, Paper Heart  is a charming hybrid documentary that interweaves fictional elements into Yi’s quest for understanding the mechanics of love. Yi, along with director and co-writer Nicholas Jasenovec (played in the film by Jake Johnson) and co-star Cera, do this with a whole lot of DIY aesthetic. Yi and Cera collaborated on Paper Heart’s whimsical musical score, and Yi also designed puppets and miniature sets out of ordinary household objects in place of live-action scenes. Paper Heart does not have one moment of inauthenticity, a quality every kinda-sorta-maybe-documentary should possess.

The sight of it makes me sick to my stomach.
I can’t bear to watch this so-called “hero’s welcome” unfold in front of my eyes. I can’t look at the photos of Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi, a Libyan agent convicted of aiding in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988, slowly climb down the steps from his airplane with a smirk on his face. I can’t listen to the hundreds of Libyans cheering while this murderer of 270 civilians makes his way toward the crowd.
Perhaps al-Megrahi escaped from his life sentence in jail in Scotland? Maybe he apologized to the families of the victims and thus was set free by the government?
The truth is, he was set free for no reason.
Sure, Scottish ministers claim this release was based on “compassion” because of the pancreatic cancer that will probably kill him within three months — but since when do cold-blooded murderers like al-Megrahi deserve compassion?
This “compassion” has given almost a second (although very brief) life to al-Megrahi. Instead of dying alone in a cold cell, al-Megrahi witnessed an entire nation giving him honor and respect for his horrible deed. Rather than spending the last three months of his life thinking about the horror he committed by killing those 270 passengers, al-Megrahi will peacefully accept his death surrounded by individuals telling him he did the right thing.
The families of the bombing victims, along with the US government, have sent strong signals condemning Scotland for its decision. They don’t seem to understand the “compassion” that some Scottish ministers have in letting a terrorist go free to enjoy the end of his life in happiness.
Simply put, justice was not served.
Al-Megrahi’s release sends dangerous signals to other terrorists who now see that one of their own was let free after being convicted of his crime. Al-Megrahi’s release is a victory for terrorists everywhere.
Libya will also experience diplomatic tension with the West, especially the United States. The United Kingdom, despite heavy diplomatic pressure from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, agreed to release al-Megrahi on the condition that he would not receive a hero’s welcome upon his arrival. Moammar Gadhafi, the country’s dictator, agreed to the deal and al-Megrahi came home. Gadhafi ignored his promise and gave the terrorist a hero’s welcome, defying the West and its request.
What’s even more sickening is evidence that the United Kingdom released al-Megrahi in order to increase trade and economic relations with Libya.
According to the Telegraph, Gadhafi’s son, Saif al-Islam, and Lord Trefgarne (president of the Libyan-British Business Council), have “essentially confirmed” the release was to promote mutual financial benefits between the two nations. Gadhafi himself said the release “will be positively reflected for sure in all areas of cooperation between the two countries.”
The idea of releasing a convicted murderer in exchange for the promise of profit is immoral and points to the governmental greed when it comes to increasing their nation’s wealth.
This episode will do much to erase some of the progress Gadhafi has made in normalizing diplomatic relations with the West. Already barely able to touch the surface as a well-received nation in the international community, Libya risks sinking deep into isolation because of Western sanctions and trade restrictions.
President Barack Obama gets ready to lead a United Nations Security Council non-proliferation meeting next month in New York, where Gadhafi will be present.
We can only hope that ramifications will be vast.

One time in the fourth grade, a couple of my friends decided it would be funny to pour water all over a bus seat before the return leg of a three-hour class field trip. If everything went according to plan, an unsuspecting victim would sit down in said seat and react to the unfortunate discovery in a manner that would immediately draw attention to the wet spot forming on the seat of his pants.
There were two things learned that day.
First, soaking a bus seat does not pan out to be as funny as one imagines in his mind.
Second, and more importantly, a three-hour bus ride can feel like an eternity with an enraged, wet-bottomed teacher shooting glances at everyone within a two-seat radius of the dampest seat on the bus.
In the ensuing prosecution that took place that fateful day, my teacher grouped me in with the guilty party solely because I was friends with the offender. Luckily, others vouched for my innocence and I got out of the ordeal scratch-free.
Friends of spray can-wielding street taggers can only hope to be so lucky, if Los Angeles City Attorney Carmen Trutanich gets his way.
As a way to help curb the graffiti problem that’s been ailing the city for so long, Trutanich is proposing a series of hard-line injunctions targeting “tagging crews,” groups of suspected vandals and their cohorts, which would include grounds for arrest of any persons caught in cahoots with taggers.
Under this proposed plan, renegade street taggers would be treated more like convicted murderers and drug lords than the public nuisances they often turn out to be.
Perhaps it’s for good reason — last year, there were more than 600,000 reported cases of vandalism in the city, an astounding number as is, but even more daunting when accounting for the thousands more instances that went unreported.
Additionally, while many taggers are of the adrenaline junky and misguided artist variety, there are also those who are tasked to tag certain areas as a way to mark areas of a certain gang’s domain or drug trafficking locations. While it may turn out to be true that Trutanich just has some sort of personal vendetta against large bridge-entrance murals, ostensibly this new set of harsh regulations seems to be more of a stand against the latter group of miscreants.
Harold: You and your purple crayon have been warned.
But while the intentions may be good, the aims do not seem to justify the means in this case.
Modeled off the restrictions set in place to monitor and quell any suspected gang activity, proposed injunctions would include police intervention in situations where two members of “tagging crews” engage in conversation, as well as the ability for police to send people to jail for hanging around those spraying graffiti. Not only might the police nab people who they catch — literally — red-handed, but also their friends who were caught clean-handed.
Whereas my possible punishments would’ve ranged from silent lunch to a loss of recess had I been roped into the party of guilty persons, members of “tagging crews” face much stiffer and grimmer prospects.
Granted, each injunction would have to be approved by a judge and would only apply to those accused of vandalism in the past.
Even so, this seems to be a rather harsh treatment for one inconvenient cosmetic issue.
Graffiti colors the city. It would be foolish to turn a blind eye and say otherwise. And while there are groups that admire these works of rogue art, there are others who have a much more personal stake in the aesthetic appeal of their neighborhoods and city (i.e., small business owners).
But it seems rather circular to bend the Constitution to take away an individual’s rights in an attempt to uphold the integrity of the city.
Rather than burning the house down to get rid of an ant problem, Trutanich should seek a much more pragmatic (and perhaps more constitutional) method of trying to tackle the graffiti problem.
You can’t change the rules in the middle of the game, no matter how badly you might want to win.

Recessions, ironically, tend to sell themselves. So abstract that anything can be blamed on it, yet pervasive enough to influence everything from your health care to how many “five for $1” deals you can rack up in a month, the scapegoat that is economic downturn has been peddling its wares to the American public for more than a year now.
Not unlike Twitter, everyone has an opinion about the recession — whether it’s almost over, just begun or a socialist conspiracy concocted by Hollywood, Nancy Pelosi and the Clinton family.
The issue of health-care reform is sweeping the American public in a similar fashion.
And that’s just great, isn’t it?  As our comrades in civil rights remind us by toting pistols to town halls or making “Obama = Hitler” posters, here in the United States you can assume whatever position you please on any issue. Key word: assume.
Of course, debate that is more inflammatory than informed is no stranger to politics in this country. (Thank goodness I can get all that precious inflammation-reducing lycopene from my favorite vegetable, ketchup.) But today, the two biggest issues on our plate deal with the very minutiae of two of the most prevalent institutions that structure daily American life: health care and finance.
These issues are far more complicated than singular issues like electing a certain leader or bombing this or that country. In reforming health care and the financial system, we will, in essence, be reforming the way in which we carry out our lives, the ways in which government performs critical functions.
Yet in the modern media market, this depth prevents Americans at large from gaining any meaningful understanding of what’s going on, what could go on or what should go on. How is the public supposed to figure out which policies will best mitigate a recession when it can’t explain the subprime mortgages and securities that led to it in the first place?
How are people supposed to tune out the outrageous “death panel” claims when they don’t know what’s actually being created?
Every citizen has the right and the responsibility to inform themselves, but with all the crazy information out there, that task may not come so easily. Before we have a partisan debate about credit or doctor’s bills, we need a common base of information to work with.
The government needs to take a more aggressive step to inform the public about reform and quell deconstructive, confusing and inflammatory outbursts of misinformation. Town halls have been a revolutionary way of getting information out there, but they are evidently not enough. Targeting outlandish conservative radio outlets is one way.  And how about including a brochure about the stimulus package and bailouts with that nifty check?
What if we all put down Oprah’s book of the month for a second and got together to discuss health care legislation, or each other’s bank statements? Better yet, have you ever seen the reports issued by the Congressional Research Service? They’re these nice, simple, summarized versions of bills for representatives, to help them understand what they’re reading. How about a Citizen’s Research Service?
Misinformation is getting in the way of progress, and, no matter where you fall in the political spectrum (marijuana legalizer or helicopter wolf hunter), it’s safe to say that no rational, loyal American citizen can afford to sit back and let these issues go unattended simply because no one had the patience to listen and learn.
We need to stop assuming that we know all the facts about where we stand, and, more importantly, stop assuming that everyone screaming at us from across the aisle will never stop screaming. Before we expect extended benefits, we should extend the benefit of the doubt to our opponents — and maybe they’ll do the same. Then we can educate ourselves (and each other) enough to effect some actual change.
If the current administration wants to preserve the momentum of “Yes We Can,” it needs to remind Americans that having the “right” stance on an issue isn’t enough to get your way in a democracy.  The Left needs to stop disdaining people who are scared because they don’t understand, and the Right — well, okay, if you can kick Glenn Beck out, that’ll be good for now in my book.

Rare is a thing so unknowable as to provide infinite wonder. In a simpler age, the night sky might have been such a thing. It sure isn’t now.
Last Monday marked the three-year anniversary of one of the saddest days in recent memory: Pluto’s demotion to dwarf-planet status. Years of watching Ms. Frizzle and her magic school bus navigate the nine planets of the solar system with her intrepid students — wasted.
Lucy Mueller | Daily Trojan
Much has been written on that fateful vote by the International Astronomical Union to divest Pluto of its planetary rights — some supportive, some critical — but little can be gained by rehashing old arguments. What’s done, as Lady Macbeth said of another fateful, equally disturbing event, is done. Nothing we Plutophiles say or do now will give us back what we have irrevocably lost.
We should be less concerned about the fate of Pluto now and more concerned about the fate of the cosmos, which faces another kind of demotion.
Pluto, it should be noted by way of explanation, was demoted by vote, a severe blow to claims of science’s so-called rigor. What’s worse, the vote was based on a poorly assembled, very new definition of “planet,” one which some experts — including the director of the Planetary Science Institute, according to CNN — say will be invalidated in a few years. Finally, when members of the IAU convened in August 2006 to cast their ballots, only 4 percent actually showed up. Not only was the process decidedly unscientific, it was decidedly informal.
We can’t help but think of political institutions like the Senate while reading of the IAU’s  “scientific” voting procedures, which should clue us in to a tragic eventuality: the slow but steady politicization of space. Important matters of science have been reduced, or demoted, to unimportant matters of politics.
Before all this — well before the politics, before we even knew of the solar system and of the existence of other planets — space was, like a cookie jar to a small child, maddeningly unreachable — and probably a lot more wonderful because of it. Our distant ancestors could look up at the night sky and simply gape at its unknowable vastness, perfectly content in their blissful ignorance.
Contemplating the unknowable enriches and expands the mind. If we already have the answers, we rarely engage the questions. We need to wonder. We need to not know.
Now, instead of seeing what might be fireflies caught in that big bluish-black thing, or a holey blanket draped across the sky by some god of sleep, we see stars and planets, named and codified by an impersonal political authority. The politicization of space becomes the demystification of space: lowly earthbound scientists systematically squashing the wonder out of one of the world’s richest gifts. This is the ultimate cosmic demotion.
One might say this hopelessly quixotic argument discourages progress by aiming to restrict man’s inborn propensity to make sense of the world. Not so.
A continuous pursuit of knowledge is only meaningful if we do it carefully, never forgetting to keep asking questions. More specifically, we should not politicize the process of ruling on the planetary statuses of heavenly bodies, making the mystical seem as banal as getting pork-barrel spending legislation passed through 4 percent of the Senate.
I don’t want to look up at the night sky and think about the IAU bickering over Pluto’s status as a planet. I want to see an expanse of profound nothingness, something I never want to fully understand, but nonetheless glory in trying to. I want one of the last vestiges of genuine wonder on this planet to be preserved, to be unpolluted by man’s compulsive quest to know everything. Sometimes, ignorance truly can be bliss.

The financial crises, budget cuts and hiring freezes plaguing nearby Los Angeles Unified School District schools have not gone unnoticed by USC.
The recent layoffs and budget cuts have made news on campus, and a district-wide cancellation of summer school this year was enough to spark students into action.

Students in a summer WRIT 340 class heard of LAUSD’s problems and decided something needed to be done. The solution, they concluded, was to create a free online database of educational resources for K-8 students.
The site, www.SOSclassroom.org, was started by 16 USC students taught by professor Mark Marino. It incorporates links sent in by students, parents and educators and provides LAUSD students with an easy way to find learning resources online.
Marino presented the opportunity to the students in the class — a “Writing with Technology” section — on the first day of the summer semester. The students took to the “Save Our Summer” concept immediately.
“He came in one day and said, ‘Hey, there’s this idea I want to run by you guys,’ and a lot of people sounded attracted from the start,” said Matt Schrader, a junior majoring in broadcast journalism and the public relations director for the program.
Each of the USC students took on a role, ranging from education liaisons to project managers.
“It helped to give each member in the class a sense of purpose, which is something that creates a great learning environment for them,” Marino said. “Once the site was put up [on July 6], we phased out of it a little bit, but it still remained the common project that was driving the course and really energizing the students.”
The work on the website culminated in a July 24 trip by the USC students to a summer camp at Hancock Park Elementary School. Trojan offensive linemen Kristofer O’Dowd and Martin Coleman — both juniors in Marino’s class — spoke about the importance of learning in unconventional ways and even learning outside of school.
“They were very motivated and attached to this project,” Marino said. “When I talked to LAUSD educators, they were astounded at how quickly these students were able to put together these set of resources.”
The district continues to face challenges, including attempts to restart summer school for 2010, but in the meantime, SOS Classroom will try to complement normal school year curriculum on its site.
“It’s not a cure-all,” said John Newsom, a Los Angeles-based consultant who serves on the SOS classroom advisory board. “But at the same time, it’s an immediate and proactive solution to immediate problems facing us all. From that point of view, the district has been appreciative.”
Marino is teaching three new WRIT 340 classes this semester. But, more than half of his summer students have expressed interest in continuing on with the site, and Marino plans on pitching the idea to his new students in the upcoming week. The following step, he said, would probably be expanding the site to include resources for high school students.
“By no means are we saying that 16 USC students can solve the education process single-handedly,” Marino said. “We got a lot of resources from lots of people and this doesn’t solve the problem, but this is something that will help if people know about it. That’s the most important thing.”

After spending a semester searching for an affordable bicycle, sophomore Micah Greenberg found an original business opportunity instead. Seeing that many other students also had a hard time finding cheap beach cruisers, Greenberg started Dormbikes, a business that offers a cheaper alternative to traditional stores.
“Last year, as a student living in Parkside, I spent about an hour every day walking in between classes to my dorm, fraternity and to social engagements,” said Greenberg, who is majoring in international relations and business administration. “I remember seeing an old used bike being sold for $95 at the University Village’s bike shop and thinking to myself that there had to be better, more personalized, more efficient ways to buy and sell a bike.”
Pedal pusher · Dormbikes founder Micah Greenberg personally orders, assembles and delivers custom beach cruisers for students living near the USC campus at cheaper prices than the local stores. - James Watson | Daily Trojan
Since the idea was born in December 2008, Greenberg has been preparing to launch Dormbikes. The company assembles and delivers new custom beach cruisers to USC students for as little as $95.
The company began promoting its service during the summer and made its first delivery Friday.
Students can log onto the Dormbikes website, www.dormbikes.com, and choose a bike model and color and accessories such as baskets and locks. Greenberg then receives the orders and sends an inventory request to wholesale suppliers.
Greenberg and his employees rent out a truck to pick up and deliver the bikes, which they assemble themselves. They deliver on Thursdays and Fridays to the USC campus and surrounding areas.
Currently, most of his
employees are friends who want to help assemble and deliver bikes, and spread the word of his business. Some of his friends joined because they’re too were in the same situation as Greenberg last year.
“I joined because freshman year I was looking for a bike and could not find one at the local businesses,” said Melanie Mathis, a sophomore majoring in political science and international relations. “I respect anyone who is taking that lead to help students.”
Greenberg runs his business from his room at the Theta Chi fraternity house, which keeps
overhead costs low, but Greenberg  said he will still need to sell a large volume of bikes to make a profit.
“By customizing what we buy to the needs of our individual customers, we cut down on a lot of the expenses associated with a traditional bike shop,” Greenberg said. “Currently, we are hoping that volume will make up for the near wholesale prices our customers receive.”
Greenberg said he tries to sell his bikes for as close to wholesale price as he can.
Nikke Soremekun, a senior majoring in business administration and Spanish, said though Dormbikes’ prices can be cheaper, there are certain perks to buying a bike from a store.
“Compared to a store, the price would be lower because its coming from wholesale,” Soremekun said. “But a store would be able to handle and offer a warranty differently plus offer additional services than just a person. The only worry is that if this business gets bigger it won’t be able to offer what it is offering to its customers at a larger scale.”
Greenberg plans to make sure his business gives back to the community by giving 5 percent of his profit to a local charity. He also hopes to reduce Dormbikes’ environmental impact by recycling any packaging or waste throughout the whole process.
“I have strong ideals as to how a company should behave — its responsibilities towards its customers, workers and community,” Greenberg said. “I wanted to prove that all businesses can be managed responsibly and still be profitable.”
Greenberg said he drew inspiration from his father’s and
grandfather’s entrepreneurship — both started separate small businesses  — and his business education.
“The goal of the company is to create a more efficient, competitive, customer friendly way to sell bikes,” said Greenberg. “As Dormbikes matures, I intend to direct even more of its resources towards philanthropic giving.”
Greenberg’s focus right now is taking care of his local customers and he said he remains hopeful for the future of the company.
“Right now, we’re just making sure we do USC right — Dormbikes has the capacity to expand regionally and even nationally,” Greenberg said. “To really break into the market, we’re just trying to spread the word about who we are and what we offer.”

With health experts warning of a possible pandemic, university and county health officials and the USC Office of Student Affairs are taking special steps to mitigate the spread of H1N1 influenza and are warning students to be especially careful this flu season.
Building on the school’s experience handling last year’s norovirus outbreak, Student Affairs has formed a plan in case H1N1 hits the university.  Officials intend to set up a telephone triage center where students who might have contracted the virus can receive free medical advice, as well as an online system sick students can use to order meals, so they don’t infecting others.
“We are strongly encouraging students, faculty and staff to stay home as soon as they get sick until 24 hours after their fever is gone,” said Dr. Lawrence Neinstein, executive director of the University Park Health Center.
Neinstein and Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson have already sent a letter to parents and students warning of the virus and offering prevention tips.
In October, in conjunction with the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Health, the university is planning to distribute the seasonal flu vaccine for free.
Although the vaccination will only serve as protection from the seasonal flu virus, Neinstein said the university hopes to conduct another free vaccination program after the government releases the pandemic H1N1 vaccine in October.
“As soon as we get [the vaccine], we will talk about how we can get it out to students,” Neinstein said. “We would like to get as many students under 24 vaccinated because that is the group Public Health has said is the first high-risk priority.”
According to Dr. Laurene Mascola, chief of the Acute Communicable Disease Control Program for the Department of Public Health, people younger than 50 are at greater risk of contracting H1N1 because they have never had contact with a similar strain.
University students are especially vulnerable because of their high population densities around college campuses, Mascola said.
“Going to mass gatherings, subways and large apartments put you at higher risk for contracting the virus,” Mascola said. “…Dormitories will be more at risk because [students] are living in close quarters.”
University health officials are also urging students to refrain from taking Tamiflu — the most widely-used influenza treatment and prevention drug — if they feel sick, because overuse may cause the virus to become resistant.
“[Tamiflu] is not a cure-all and will, at most, reduce symptoms by 24 hours,” Neinstein said. “It should be saved for those who have been hospitalized or suffer from chronic illness like cancer, diabetes and asthma.”
Tamiflu can also be given as a prophylactic to students with compromised immune systems if they have been exposed to the virus.
However, Mascola said this approach still may not prevent students from contracting the virus.
“Once you get flu in the community, you are going to be exposed to the virus every three or four days,” she said.
The pandemic H1N1 virus is a new strain combining human, avian and swine genes, but health officials say the virus is nothing like the 1918 influenza epidemic — a form of H1N1 — that infected more than half a billion people, mostly young adults.
“Don’t panic. People hear the words ‘pandemic swine flu’ and freak out,” Mascola said. “People who are healthy should not have a problem — you feel junky and move on.”
Barsegh Barseghian, a sophomore majoring in biology who transferred to USC this year, said his community college sent out messages to students last year warning them to take special precautions against H1N1 influenza.
“I didn’t take it to be a big deal,” Barseghian said. “I just took the careful precautions and did not go around sick people.”
USC health officials say the best way to prevent the spread of H1N1 is to get vaccinated and stay home if flu-like symptoms appear. Taking smaller precautions, such as frequent hand-washing and sneezing into the crook of the arm, is also recommended.
“If you have a fever, wear a mask if you are walking outside of your room,” Neinstein said. “You should not be going out because you are just going to spread the infection.”
