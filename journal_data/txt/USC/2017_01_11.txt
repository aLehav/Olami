USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences announced the Martens Scholars Program, a scholarship program meant to attract top students to USC. The program was made possible by the donation of two Dornsife alumni, Harlan and Linda Martens, who pledged $15 million to create an endowed fund to support students at Dornsife.
Harlan Martens majored in economics and became an attorney for Exxon Mobil, while Linda Martens majored in history  and has been involved in charitable endeavors, including serving as a board member of the National Charity League. Their financial support includes their membership in the USC Associates and the naming of Martens Plaza, located near Leavey Library, in their honor. 
The Martens Scholars Program is their second contribution, following a 2013 $1 million donation to endow the Linda and Harlan Martens Endowed Director’s Chair for the USC-Huntington Early Modern Studies Institute to help sustain the vision of USC as a top-tier global research university. 
The fund provides partial- and full-tuition scholarships for both new and returning students, and sponsors fellowships for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The program will support up to six undergraduates every four years with a full tuition, four-year scholarship in addition to a $5,000 stipend for travel or research. Furthermore, it will fund four more partial-tuition scholarships, two partial-tuition scholarship for transfer students, two two-year fellowships for doctoral and graduate students and two senior fellowships for postdoctoral fellows. 
One person whose life has already been impacted by the Martens’ gift is Kelly Chang, a junior transfer to USC Dornsife, who received the first Martens scholarship. Chang transferred from University of California, Irvine, following in the footsteps of her father and her sister, who both attended USC. Chang, who is majoring in cognitive science and pursuing a minor in cinematic arts, shares the Martens’ view about the power of education, something that she learned while on a Los Angeles Zoo sponsored service research trip to South Africa. 
“I plan to work for the benefit of disadvantaged students so that they can expand their opportunities,” said Chang, who emulates the Martens’ belief of paying their blessings forward, to USC News.
The Martens stated that their wish is to enable students to learn and innovate in a variety of fields without having to worry about the financial burden of an education. According to Linda Martens, Dornsife was the ideal school to bring their vision of the scholarship to fruition. 
 “We see this gift as a way to invest in these students’ hopes and dreams,” Linda Martens said to USC News.

The USC Sol Price School of Public Policy hosted Assistant Professor Pamela Clouser McCann on Jan. 11 at Ralph and Goldy Lewis Hall. McCann discussed her latest research regarding negotiations between the House of Representatives and the Senate during the process of passing legislation
McCann, a Ph.D. graduate from the University of Michigan, said that her initial interest in public policy from her prior experience as a genetic counselor. Observing that new healthcare reform laws would impact her patients immensely, McCann decided to pursue further education to understand the process of policymaking.
“When I was seeing my patients, I was often influenced by new legislation,” McCann said. “[This] created a number of difficulties for my patients. When you get trained in genetics, though you get taught certain things about genetic ethics, you don’t get a lot of political science, which is why I went back to school.”
McCann’s research focused on finding a way to accurately understand the House of Representatives and the Senate’s respective contributions to each new piece of legislation. Before a bill becomes law, it must be passed first by the House and the Senate. During this process, according to McCann, many negotiations between the House and the Senate take place due to the politicians’ appeasement of various special interest groups. 
In her research, McCann discovered that the bargaining process between the House and the Senate was influenced by each group’s patience as well as the order in which each group passed the law. 
“We found that patience comes into play in the effectiveness of your bargaining,” McCann said. “If you are more patient, you would be able to bargain for more, whereas if you are less patient, you would be able to bargain for less. Applying this to the Senate and the House, because Senate members have longer tenures than House members do, Senate members are seen as more patient and in that sense often are able to bargain for more in their law negotiations.”
In terms of order, McCann concluded from her research that, for Senate members, being the first to see the legislation gave it more leverage to bargain. The House of Representatives almost always bargained for less than the Senate could. But, in certain cases, the House could bargain for more than it usually could against the Senate. As a result, the negotiated final enactment would often be largely composed of shared words between the House and Senate bills, with a higher emphasis on the Senate’s intentions. 
Beyond the ostensible bargaining, however, McCann presented the idea of tacit bargaining, an idea stating that the act of bargaining in itself is a disadvantage in that by bargaining, one shares information about oneself that may put the competitor at an advantage. Applying tacit bargaining to the House and the Senate, McCann found in her research that sometimes the House of Representatives could bargain for more than it usually could through the act of tacit bargaining and understanding Senate members’ ulterior motives.
Looking at House and Senate contributions to recent laws in Congress, McCann observed a trend that, according to her, may be caused by the recent gridlock in Congress.
McCann recognized that her new findings would allow more in-depth research on the lack of consensus between the House and Senate. According to McCann, one way to better understand the trends in the House of Representatives and Senate negotiations would be to expand her sample of laws from recently passed laws to include unpassed legislation as well. This, according to McCann, would increase understanding of the failings of Congressional negotiations as opposed to simply the successes. 
“Over time, House unique contribution varies a bit, but goes way down in recent Congress,” McCann said. “Senate unique contribution also decreases in recent Congress, which is understandable because lately it seems as if Congress has not been able to pass too much. But what was surprising to see was that consensus between House and Senate increased in the recent Congress, whereas negotiations decreased drastically.”

Professor Robert Shrum will bring his political experience  and expertise to the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, where he hopes to promote communication between students and political professionals in his role as the center’s new director.
One of Shrum’s goals as director of Unruh is to build off of what already exists. That means creating more internships in Washington, D.C. and featuring more political discussions and conferences. Most importantly, he wants to focus on students first. 
“I think Unruh is a valuable resource for students on this campus, and there’s a lot that’s been done that has been pretty powerful,” Shrum said. 
Last year, the Unruh Institute hosted debate-watching events, election panels and distinguished speakers, and Shrum hopes to continue that trend into 2017. He has already organized weekly seminars and presentations on President-elect Donald Trump’s first 100 days  and hopes to implement more post-election discussions. He said he would reinstate a fellows programs with the hopes of attracting political figures to teach a study group. 
Shrum’s next task is to bring Unruh into the national spotlight. He is looking to take advantage of the national attention received by the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times Presidential Election Daybreak Poll, one of the only polls predicting a Trump win. 
“That attention will encourage students to become active in politics,” Shrum said “If we can give people ways to engage and give them a sense they can make a difference overall over time, let them interact with folks who had a life in politics or spent time in politics, then I think you can attract more people.”
In December, the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences announced that Shrum would replace Professor Dan Schnur as Shnur begins work on a new center.
Shrum started off his career as a speechwriter and rose to prominence after writing Sen. Ted Kennedy’s 1980 speech at the Democratic National Convention. He then became a political consultant, working for the 2000 Al Gore  presidential campaign and the 2004 John Kerry presidential campaign. 
“All my professional life I’ve been lucky because I’ve earned a living doing what I love,” Shrum said. “Now I have a second career that I love, which is teaching and reflecting on these issues.”
In his new position, Shrum will be analyzing future elections and the current political climate, which he said is completely changing because of evolving U.S. demographics. 
“Can we figure out, not just in terms of how they vote, but the attitudes of millennials and work with folks in sociology, for example, to see how those attitudes are shaping what they think and how they decide?” Shrum said. 
To understand the underlying political changes, Shrum said he needs to go one step further.
“The dominance of Republican representatives in the House and the Senate and state legislatures may disguise a deeper, long-term problem the Republicans have with the rising American electorate,” Shrum said.
Because Shrum has been in politics for so long, he will bring a different perspective to the politics of the future, a perspective that many college students may need in their careers. 
He also commented on the recent election, citing that only 9 percent of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton ads mentioned jobs or the economy. 
“If you lose the message war, you’re probably not going to win the election anyway,” Shrum said.
Shrum will advance and maintain the Unruh Institute, where he will emphasize the importance of understanding the factors that motivate people to vote.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Amber Miller, dean of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, nominated Shrum for the position. She did not. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

“Epoch stationery for epic minds,” is the slogan of Hadron Epoch, a design studio based in Los Angeles. A small team of four, Hadron Epoch produces a variety of stationery and lifestyle items for the modern consumer. Think Kate Spade notebooks — elegant with flecks of gold lettering — but affordable. In an effort to expand its branding, Hadron Epoch came to Ground Zero Performance Café to host a pop-up shop on Jan. 11.
 Since Hadron Epoch is currently without a brick and mortar store, the company sells directly from its website and at retail stores such as Anthropologie and T.J.Maxx that carry novelty goods. Periodically, they also host pop-up shops, like the one at Ground Zero, at fairs or events to branch out to local consumers in the area.
Hadron Epoch sponsored Ground Zero’s Wednesday rap night during Welcome Week and entered the college scene for the first time in the brand’s history. It presented itself as a brand catering to young audiences through vibrant patterns and bright colors. Students who signed up for the newsletter were given a free planner and a 10 percent discount code.
 The design studio was decisive in its choosing the University  as its location for the event.
 “We are hoping to give students a fresh perspective on modern stationary they can use and a new spectrum of ideas they would be able to incorporate into their daily lives,” Jackie Ng, a marketer at Hadron Epoch, said.
 Recently, Hadron Epoch is looking to launch a new line of planners, notebooks and stationery featuring bolder colors for the millennial crowd, a shift from their former subdued designs and toned-down color schemes. It will still be under the name of the design consultancy but will market under the label Pop and be catered toward millennials who are on a tighter budget.
 Planners have been reaping in the greatest sales for the design studio this season. They come in three forms — open-dated, yearly and academic follow the themes of the Modern Collection, which are come in soft tints of pink, white and blue.
 Journals, on the other hand, generally represent the studio’s young and vibrant personality, as most are part of the brightly Illustrated Pattern Collection. Wanderlust titles such as “Go Explore” and “Be Adventurous” echo the design studio’s adherence to fun. Their philosophy, as printed on their website, states, “having fun is just as important as working hard.” Graphic illustrations of cake, dogs, cats and other whimsical images are also featured on their notebooks.
 The team at Hadron Epoch fulfills these philosophies appropriately. By definition, Hadron Epoch refers to the period of time right after the creation of the universe, the Big Bang. By adopting this title, the studio wishes to create designs that inspire a new way of thinking and creating in their contemporary universe. 
The design firm communicated this ideology through their lively, sleek products. By bringing their products to USC, their designers hope to keep inspiring younger audiences with their beautiful creations and novelty goods.
 For more information on this high-end stationery brand or to stay updated on future pop-ups and discounts, visit Hadron Epoch’s website at www.hadronepoch.com.

Winter fashion in Los Angeles is its own entity. When temperatures barely scrape below 60 degrees and the sun is still shining, it can be difficult to indulge in trends popping up on the East Coast. 
Once the holidays come around, the city sets its own course for the season. Here’s what to expect trend-wise both in Los Angeles and on USC’s campus this winter.
 Statement outerwear is a key player, making bundling up to face the gloomy California skies more of an occasion than a chore. In women’s runway fashion, the resurgence of the cape creates an elegant addition to the bulky coats that dominate winter outerwear. 
Lightweight trench coats and anoraks are gender-neutral alternatives to this cape coat trend. Faux fur, decorated denim and bombers have also surfaced as staple items for tying together a quintessential L.A. winter ensemble. Light layers are critical for the fluctuating Southern California weather, and a statement jacket is an essential final layer to create a visually interesting outfit.
 Despite the white low-top sneaker trend that graced the glossy covers of last fall’s fashion magazines, ankle boots are a necessity for the rainy winter months. Whether they’re suede, leather or even velvet, boots are a perfect finishing touch for any outfit this winter. 
Paired with cuffed jeans, ankle boots create an instantaneous fashion statement. Or maybe slip them on with a dress for an “I just threw this together” feel when having a night out.
 As is the case with every winter, cozy, loose knits in subdued neutral tones remain the go-to for Angelenos. This staple is the perfect way to keep up beachy vibes even in the California cold, for both men and women. 
Embrace the slouch of the sweater and let a delicate bralette in a complementary color peek out underneath to complete the L.A. look. For men, knit jumpers are a clean and casual staple that is stylish and warm during wintertime.
Or try experimenting with a cowl neck. This style achieves the appearance of wearing a scarf without actually adding an extra layer that may be too much, depending on the weather.
 Fashion trends seem to always have a way of coming back into style and ‘70s flared jeans are no exception this winter. Shake up a wardrobe of mostly skinnies with this classic cut. Not only do they fit in with the typical boho sensibility in Los Angeles, but they’re  also figure-flattering, eye catching and comfortable for a full day of lectures. 
Not sure about committing to a full-on flare jean? Teen Vogue has been singing the praises of the slightly, more subtle kick-flare, which shows off one’s shoes while adding a subtle rocker feel to any outfit.
 Looks that can easily transition from day to night can be difficult to come by, but the off-the-shoulder-top is this season’s simple solution. Choosing to show off the shoulders is a classy, effortless and slightly flirty way to embrace the fact Los Angeles never gets too cold for showing a little skin. 
A modified, yet equally cool version of this trend is the shoulder cut-out, which has the added benefit of being a little more secure. For guys wanting to add a similarly versatile piece to their wardrobe, look no further than the ‘70s comeback. Try a button-down in a retro print or a suede jacket to complete an outfit that works for both the classroom and the club.
 Velvet tops, slip dresses, hats or — as previously mentioned —shoes are apparently the way to go this winter, and what’s not to like? Velvet instantly dresses up any outfit, looks amazing in the seasonal jewel tones and is oh-so soft, making it completely wearable, even on the laziest days.
 As always, dad caps, leggings and sunglasses — staples in any USC wardrobe — are fair game. Those three pieces are basically necessities when putting together a casual outfit for class.

On Tuesday, President Barack Obama touched on the division apparent in American society during his farewell address.
“For too many of us, it’s become safer to retreat into our own bubbles, whether in our neighborhoods or college campuses or places of worship or our social media feeds, surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions,” Obama said. 
A CNN poll following the election found that approximately 85 percent of Americans feel that the country is more divided than ever. 
This has to change — and  that change should start right here on campus.
While some Trojans study abroad in exciting and diverse locations  like Italy and South Africa, many never study at another university in the U.S. during their undergraduate education. A program similar to studying abroad, but with the goal of allowing students to explore other parts of the U.S., could benefit the individual student, the University and even the country as a whole. Students should encourage USC to provide such initiatives, allowing the University to provide a truly diverse and engaging education while trailblazing “study away” programs. Existing initiatives like the Dornsife D.C. program are excellent starts, but a truly national exchange is necessary in order to bring students from various backgrounds together and begin healing the country’s cultural rift.
Sending college students to temporarily study at schools in diverse areas across the country could draw them outside of the bubbles that Obama criticized in his speech. In a recent essay for Inside Higher Ed, longtime educator and consultant David J. Smith advocated for a “domestic exchange program” that would take American college students “from their often comfortable environments and [provide] them with the opportunity to get to know people in other parts of the country and in different settings.”
USC prides itself on its diversity, and a program focused on domestic diversity and exposing students to the various cultures within our nation’s borders would further this goal. Of course, schools wouldn’t offer a program like this without student pressure, and it is hard to imagine a student from Los Angeles advocating to spend a semester in rural America over the myriad of destinations abroad. 
However, students should realize that many of the benefits of an international education would translate — and even multiply — in a domestic exchange program. One of the main goals of study abroad programs is increasing cultural understanding, which in the context of a domestic exchange program could translate into increased political and cultural understanding between students from blue and red states. 
A quick glance at USC’s admission statistics highlights the potential for students to step outside their comfort zones. About 42 percent of USC’s Fall 2016 class went to high school in California, and even some of the students who come from out of state simply move from another urban area to Los Angeles. 
Sending USC students from Los Angeles into rural areas, the Midwest or the South could potentially expose them to different ways of thinking. Students could increase their understanding of the economic issues caused by the decline of the auto industry through trips to Detroit, of the unique challenges posed by extreme weather along the Gulf Coast and of the frustrations of residents of middle America by staying in an agricultural town in Nebraska. Living among residents of these areas would promote a level of understanding and would truly open the eyes of USC students to the problems present in other parts of the country, building empathy and likely proving beneficial to both populations. 
In addition to more intangible personal benefits, such as increased political understanding and knowledge of a different part of the country, a national exchange program could potentially benefit students in their professional careers. Political science students with national ambitions could clearly benefit from connections in different parts of the country, especially areas with views different from their own. Journalism students would gain a better understanding of parts of the country they could later write about. Science and engineering students could gain an understanding of the unique problems faced by different parts of the country and how residents would like those problems addressed. 
USC wouldn’t be the first school to offer a domestic exchange program. Brown University and Tougaloo College, a historically black college, have partnered for “study away” programs since 1964. 
The USC Mission Statement notes that the University “plays an increasingly important role in the development of the nation and the world.” With many now arguing that one of the biggest roadblocks to our nation’s development is the lack of national unity, a domestic exchange program could place USC at the forefront of this effort and entrench the Trojan Family even more firmly in the United States.

Last week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo proposed that the State of New York should cover the cost of tuition at public universities and colleges within the state. This plan, which would offer aid to families earning up to $125,000, promises to reduce the amount of debt accrued by students classified as “needy” and boost college enrollment by about 10 percent. However, advocates of free tuition programs like this do not consider their full ramifications.
The issue of tuition-free college became a rallying cry for many students all over the country during the politically charged past year. Indeed, as a result of the recent increase in tuition that took effect last semester, groups of students repeatedly voiced their discontent with the way that education services are provided and the cost of education here at USC.
But tuition costs and debt serve a purpose beyond filling a university’s coffers. Tuition can serve as an incentive to actually finish a degree. Debt can serve as an incentive to pursue a competitive career with high potential for upward mobility. After all, if there isn’t a substantial cost associated with college education, there isn’t a strong reason to complete it quickly, as best as one can, and enter the workforce. Compound that with the notorious difficulty of finding well-paying jobs, and staying in school to rack up another degree for free sounds like an excellent option. This would void the original purpose of a free tuition program: to raise graduation rates, put more graduates into the workforce and ultimately increase state tax revenues as a result of higher median incomes.
Some may argue that this perspective ignores the plight of students who could not possibly hope to complete a degree if they had to pay tuition because of economic considerations. As it stands, only 17 percent of students at City University of New York community colleges graduate with an Associate’s Degree, even with the University’s modest tuition. This is likely due, at least in part, to the burdens of everyday financial pressures on students. Unfortunately, Cuomo’s plan does little to help individuals who are so encumbered.
New York’s plan is merely facially progressive. It would only cover tuition costs for students — room and board, miscellaneous costs and living expenses are not included. This means that students at State University of New York campuses will only save a little over $6,000 per year if they are residents. Non-residents could expect to save about $16,000. This pales in comparison to the total cost of attending the State University of New York under the program, which would still vary from over $8,000 to $16,670 per year. Another weakness of the policy proposed by Cuomo is that many needy students already qualify for federal and New York state financial aid that could cover the cost of tuition in full. In other words, low-income students would still have substantial economic burdens that went unaddressed under Cuomo’s plan. 
New York’s tuition-free system of education, as it is currently constructed, is clearly inadvisable. Its effectiveness is called into question because it wouldn’t help needy students and would only buttress the advantages of those who can afford to stay in school. The conclusion that New York’s plan is unwise is supported by the fact that Cuomo overlooked the substantial costs associated with such a program. His administration estimates that the program would cost taxpayers $163 million in 2019, but the New York City Independent Budget Office has estimated that it could cost $70 million more — and that is only accounting for the City University of New York. Because there are several State University of New York campuses that were not considered in that estimation, the total cost per year can only go up from Cuomo’s underinflated number. 
As it currently appears, New York’s plan is simply a farce. Those who wish to make college affordable for all qualified students ought not look to banning tuition or student loans. Those institutions ensure that students are motivated to pursue careers that contribute to their own personal development and the prosperity of society. Instead, advocates should tackle the root causes of students’ economic burden by demanding that ample living stipends be provided during a student’s education. Finally, due to the constructive effects that it can have on students and their careers, the cost of tuition should not be modified to account for need. Instead, students ought to pay the same tuition if they received the same educational services — but perhaps some could be allowed to pay over a longer period of time than others.

Undergraduate Student Government senators voted unanimously to change the name of the Women’s Student Assembly to the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment at the first USG meeting of the semester Tuesday. 
SAGE Assistant Director Maddie Hengst said that the change came about in order for the group to better fulfill its mission statement and  become a better resource for both cisgender and transgender students. 
“Our mission statement recognizes that we do not just cater to female-identified students, but also cater to students of all gender identities,” Hengst said. “We also don’t want to alienate any of our constituency by focusing exclusively on women.”
Several senators initially voiced their confusion over the choice of a name change instead of the creation of an entirely new student organization. Sen. Leena Danpour asked why WSA did not choose to remain the same and simply create a new group called SAGE. 
“I hope that in the future women wouldn’t feel alienated by our organization or feel inadequately represented by our organization,” Hengst said in response. “I think right now the organization wasn’t appropriately representing our mission statement, so this name change isn’t really changing the purpose of our organization at all — it’s just better reflecting what our mission statement has been and the work we’ve been doing for the past few years.”
Sen. Emily Lee wanted to know if WSA’s name change would expand its functions and encroach on the functions of the Queer and Ally Student Assembly. Sen. Kate Oh said that for the most part, this would not occur.
“Gender identity and sexual orientation identity are different things,” Oh said. “There might be overlap, but there shouldn’t be any encroachment.”
After the vote to change WSA to SAGE passed unanimously, Sen. Tyler Matheson presented his resolution to create a system notifying students of whether or not they are taking any pass-fail courses. The electronic system, which will also notify them of how many pass-fail courses they registered for, aims to provide students with useful information about classes.
Senators will vote on whether or not to pass this resolution at the next USG meeting.
Ok, so they are dropping the word women because it makes some women feel excluded because they are not women. What is logic? If people don’t consider themselves women, then maybe the women’s group isn’t for them and why do they care? …unless a lot of women who say they don’t believe they are women don’t actually believe they aren’t women. Why else would you care? If you are a woman, then how do you feel excluded by the word woman? Either shut up or admit you’re just against women organizing in general because none of this makes any sense if you actually believe in gender identity being real.
Nice work, sisters… keep catering to males in dresses. See what they ever do for you.
The trans cult is deranged and misogynist to the core.
r/gendercritical
Now women can’t even talk about women issues. Transgenderism is an anti-female movement.
So much for being Pro Choice, can’t tell A real women what to do , War On Real Women
So they are going to support all genders? Why not just merge with stuent assembly?
No, they will support all genders, except men. Because they are sexists.
Correct.  It’s like how the “diversity” narrative is really a devious way of getting around saying “white men need not apply”.  A classic over-correction by the Left.
There is nothing more fragile than the male ego. Aggrieved male entitlement is toxic.
nametheproblem. com
There are plenty of things more fragile than the male ego, and apparently truth and science are two examples.  Both are being challenged here. There are only two genders:  female and male.  Gender is not fluid or a state of mind. This is the truth as found in science.  This truth does not change with time and social attitudes.  This truth should not be sacrificed by a social movement that wishes to normalize a mental illness and promote a lie.  The transgender lie should not be promoted at, of all places, a university… Where science and truth should be taught and protected.
There was nothing wrong with the original name of the Women’s Student Assembly.  That name truly empowered women because it celebrated the beautiful and unique differences that women bring to humanity.  Every wonderful thing it means to be a woman is diluted and imperiled when gender science is sacrificed.  
Please take a humble breath, and get back to the reason you are in school to begin with.  
By supporting males who identify as women, they are supporting men. All you fellas have to do is declare your identity as women, and you’re in. You don’t need a dress or makeup or hormones or surgery or anything, just a self declaration. You don’t even have to shave your beard. You and Benjamin  (below) should do this to prove the point how ridiculous this “identity” crap is. You guys can be the “Danielle Muscato” twins.
Sad day for higher education in America.  Sad day for science.

When junior Ilana Spiegel was tasked with creating a media project at USC, she turned toward American icon Rosie the Riveter and her own desire to promote intersectional feminism for inspiration.
Spiegel has had an appreciation for the media idol since she was little, but found it difficult to identify with a powerful figure who didn’t look like her.
“I grew up with Rosie the Riveter at my house. I had a poster when I was younger. She’s always been this really great iconic figure to me that I thought was so beautiful and so strong,” Spiegel said. “Even though I absolutely loved her and what she stood for, I always did have trouble identifying with her.”
It was that disconnect that later inspired her to come up with the project. Spiegel reached out to women of different cultures and ethnicities to photograph. Each woman put on the Rosie the Riveter garb, making some modifications to express themselves. 
The girls chose a label or labels that they identify as. 
“Some girls were both bisexual and Christian, some girls were Jewish and atheist at the same time,” Spiegel said. “Some people did single labels, and some people did multiple labels.”
USC sophomore Joanna Izon identified herself as Nigerian. 
“As a black woman, it’s been difficult for me growing up because I always wanted to conform to these ideals of beauty,” Izon told USA Today College. “This was an opportunity for me to empower myself and others who don’t fit that cookie-cutter ideal. We can all be as iconic as Rosie the Riveter even though we don’t look like she did.”
Spiegel said that she hoped the girls she photographed would be able to find Rosie inside of themselves.
“To me, Rosie represents not any sort of singular person but she represents an ideal of strength, inclusion and solidarity between women,” Spiegel said. “I think that’s really important to note right now because there’s been this concept of ‘what does it truly represent? Who does it truly represent?’ You have to embody your own version about her. That’s what I hoped the project would do help women realize there is no singular way to be a strong woman, there’s all these ways.”
That’s how the project helped inspire USC senior Shannon Delijani, who identifies as Iranian Jewish. At 6 feet 2 inches tall, Delijani is not what a typical woman is expected to look like. 
“Women in general were always petite unless they were runway models, which I am definitely not,” Delijani told USA Today College.  “It’s so important to be mindful of what messages we send, even with images and stories that are meant to be empowering.”
Ensuring that women of all bodies and backgrounds are all portrayed as strong, beautiful women is what the Rosie project is all about. 
“The concept of sisterhood is also supportive to me, creating this supportive, loving environment, not only between Trojans and USC students, or women or women of color, but on a global scale,” Spiegel said. “Inclusion is not limited to skin color either; it’s sexuality, it’s faith, it’s political viewpoint, gender or non gender depending on how you identify. It’s about recognizing all these tiny, tiny differences and seeing what a beautiful collage they make.” 
Since presenting the project, Spiegel has copyrighted the images and has been distributing them to educators upon request. Currently, she has seven elementary schools, middle schools and high schools using the Rosie project as an educational tool to promote solidarity among girls. 
“It’s the greatest to show young women, particularly little girls who perhaps did not grow up with heroes that look like them, and show them that there are heroes out there that they can aspire to be,” Spiegel said. “I didn’t grow up with strong women in my media culture that looked like me, so part of this project was creating these figures and then passing them on to the younger generations so that they can see and they can identify with Rosie. They’ll say ‘Hey, I can be just as strong. Look at that. I can be Rosie too!’”

The USC Village will now feature an underground rainwater containment system used to capture and filter almost all rainwater that falls above the Village. The system will become the largest privately owned structure of its type in Los Angeles.
 The complex uses six wells that have been positioned under the 15-acre property. Each tank extends 60 feet below the ground and has the capacity to collect 200,000 gallons of water.
The water will first enter pipes situated above ground. These tubes permit water to flow into dry wells, which also act as filtration systems.
In the first 40 feet of these wells, rocks will help separate the trash and other contaminants, such as oil, that enter the pipes from above ground. The filtration system will then set apart any of the leftover trash from the rainwater. 
 “Basically the top 40 feet is where we collect all the drainage that comes in from the site,” said Willy Marsh, the project director of the USC Village. 
 After the water is filtered, it will flow into underground lakes referred to as aquifers. The water will ultimately be stored in these filtered wells. The purpose of the rainwater containment system is to recapture the stormwater before it enters the Los Angeles River or the ocean, thereby contributing to USC’s goal of conserving water. 
“Water conservation at the new Village is an important lesson beyond the lecture hall,” said Vishnu Ratnam, an engineering graduate student. “It’s a good example to look at how you can put what you’ve learned to good use.” 
Despite the large size of the system, administrators say that the project will not affect students.
“This will not affect student life in the USC Village,” said Emily Sandoval, the director for Residential Education. “Students will not even know it is there, as it will be built completely underground.” 
Students look forward to the system’s sustainable practices.
“For next year, I am very excited to be living in a facility that cares so much about sustainability,” said Isabella Drake, a freshman majoring in theatre. “Not every living complex is as scrupulous about the environment as the Village plans to be.” 
USC Housing residences currently feature 71 water bottle filling hydration stations that reduce the amount of plastic bottles used by USC students, and students are encouraged to recycle their trash in the recycling bins provided.
 “Posters around the residence halls remind me to recycle my garbage,” said Danielle Hazime, a freshman majoring in human biology and a staff writer for the Daily Trojan. “The accessibility of the recycling bins around the dorms facilitates this responsibility.”
 The USC Village will begin to house Trojans in Fall 2017. The complex will be able to house over 2,500 undergraduate students and will possess amenities that will integrate housing with dining, recreational and educational services.

Graduate Student Government has launched a program for spring 2017 to streamline the discount Transit Access Pass cards used by USC students to access Metro bus and rail. The program is in partnership with the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority.
The new program, the Universal College Student Transit Pass, replaces the TAP cards used by graduate students with a “smart-chip” sticker that can be placed on their USC ID cards.
Instead of applying for a reduced-fare transit pass with Metro, graduate students are now able to purchase the pass online through GSG.
“We’ve been collaborating with Metro since August on this,” said Chris Records, director of campus affairs for GSG. “We adopted the program because it will be significantly cheaper and will allow savings to be passed on to students.”
The sticker features technology that enables the USC ID card to also become a TAP card. There is no change in the fare validation process and users simply tap their USC ID card at the fare validator as they normally did with a TAP card.
The U-Pass system gives students access to all transit services offered by more than 23 TAP-participating transit providers across the Los Angeles County region, including Culver CityBus, Santa Monica Big Blue Bus and DASH, all of which are accessible via the Metro Expo Line.
The U-Pass also comes preloaded with an unlimited Metro Rail and bus pass for the spring semester. This pass can be used over an 18-week period, including spring break, starting from Jan. 9 until May 13. According to Records, approximately 1,400 USC students take advantage of the program per semester. 
In addition to USC, a number of other colleges in the L.A. area have also begun implementing the sticker technology. California State University Northridge was the first to introduce the technology during a pilot program in fall of last year.
According to GSG, compared to the previous TAP card system, the U-Pass Program will reduce the fare and still allow students to purchase a discounted semester pass. Full-time graduate students enrolled in six or more units who are interested in attaining a U-Pass can now purchase the pass on the GSG website for $107. After purchasing, students can pick up the pass during designated times at either Ronald Tutor Campus Center or the Health Sciences Campus.
“The cards were significantly more expensive than the stickers are,” Records said. “We hope that switching to the stickers will allow us to significantly lower the cost of the TAP passes and to serve more students.”
Just to clarify, because it is unclear from this article, USC U-Pass is presently a name for the unlimited Metro Bus and Metro Rail pass subsidized for you to buy through GSG. It is loaded onto a smartchip sticker from TAP that you can add to your USC ID card. USC U-Pass will not provide access to the other agencies you named. it’s the TAP technology that does. TAP is accepted on about two dozen transit agencies around LA County. What you can do is add money to that TAP sticker that hosts your USC U-Pass so you can pay for fares on those other operators, such as Big Blue Bus or Foothill Transit. Frankly, the easiest way to add money (aka “Stored Value”) to that TAP card is probably when you’re at a Metro Rail station. You can just go up to one of those ticket machines. I can’t speak to whether you’re able to add money to your TAP sticker when you pick it up.
Don’t be left stranded! Load stored value onto your TAP sticker.

Born and raised in the United States, Katherine Loi’s parents were Vietnamese Chinese refugees who fled the Vietnam War in 1975. But being a first-generation college student did not hinder Loi. She graduated from the USC Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry, served as captain in the U.S. Army and launched a mentorship website, all in a matter of five years.
For the past four years, she has provided dental care to men and women of the armed services as a captain stationed in Oklahoma. Living so far away from the community of Los Angeles and USC led her to realize the difficulty of searching for mentorship in dentistry.
“USC Dental School is the most expensive dental school in the world,” Loi said. “I had already taken out several loans. I was feeling my pocket empty while my uniformed friends were carefree.”
Loi searched for new ways to offer assistance to dental and pre-dental students at USC. She launched “Get Your Dentist On,” a free online mentorship resource which provides resources and offers guidance to students regardless of their background or stage in the application process. The site provides information geared toward helping students accomplish their professional desires.
Some of the features it includes are facts on both the pros and cons of being a dentist, what dental schools look for in applications and the application timeline.
“I felt like in today’s climate we needed more diverse voices that relate to our modern society,” Loi said. “I wanted to offer a new outlook on dentistry from a unique perspective.”
It was a traumatic car accident that propelled Loi to believe that medicine was her calling, but what most interested her about dentistry were the relationships in family dental practices between the patient and doctor. Loi’s story manifests itself through the material published on her website, as she reflects on her own experiences and paves the way for future dentists.
“The hardest part about starting the program was writing the content,” Loi said. “This took a lot of introspection. It was difficult for me to write about myself. I had to look deep within myself and consider why I decided to pursue dentistry. The most rewarding part about the website is the positive feedback that I have gotten from pre-dental applicants and my peers.”

On Tuesday, USC announced a new policy that establishes the University a smoke-free campus. The new policy, issued by Provost Michael Quick, prohibits smoking in “all indoor and outdoor facilities on university-owned and leased property,” including the Health Sciences Campus and all sorority and fraternity houses recognized by the University.
The newly instituted rule will apply to all smoking devices including hookahs and e-cigarettes. The new policy also added that “refusal by faculty, staff or students to comply with this policy may result in appropriate disciplinary action.” The previous policy allowed smoking on campus, except in indoor locations and other specific areas with no smoking signs. 
The proposal for a smoke-free campus, which was voted on in spring 2016, also recommended that “the USC administration create a Smoke-Free Campus Task Force … to implement the new policy effective fall 2016.”
With the new policy’s implementation, USC joined more than 1,500 other colleges in the United States that prohibit smoking. For those who seek to quit smoking, the USC Pharmacy currently offers a Smoking Cessation program and offers discounts on over-the-counter nicotine replacement products.

USC alumnus George Lucas announced on Tuesday his plan to build the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art in Exposition Park. Lucas and his wife, businesswoman Mellody Hobson, chose Los Angeles over Treasure Island in San Francisco as the location for the museum, which will feature pieces from Lucas’ personal collection.
“L.A. is gaining a new jewel with the breathtaking Lucas Museum of Narrative Art,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said at a press conference Tuesday afternoon. “Its presence here means that a day at Exposition Park will soon bring unrivaled opportunities to be immersed in stories told on canvas and celluloid, be moved by the richness of African-American history and expression, be awed by the wonders of science and the natural world, take a journey to the world of space exploration and sit in the stands for a world-class sporting event.” 
Lucas explained that his motivation to build and fund a museum stems from his passion for narrative.
“Narrative is one of the oldest and most important impulses in art. It is also the most popular form of art,” Lucas said. “Tracing the arc of narrative art reveals how culture is created, reinforced and then compelled to evolve.” 
For months, Lucas, along with Hobson, were deciding between rival cities Los Angeles and San Francisco; however, the board ultimately chose Los Angeles.
“I believed in the vision for the Lucas Museum, and we went after it with everything we have,” Garcetti said. “I know that L.A. is the ideal place for making sure that it touches the widest possible audience. Now it’s time to build the vision.” 
The Lucas Museum of Narrative Art will be built in Exposition Park, neighboring multiple landmarks, including the Natural History Museum and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
Additionally, the museum will be across the street from USC, Lucas’ alma mater, where he donated approximately $175 million in 2006 to foster the film program and the USC School of Cinematic Arts. 
The $1 billion, nonprofit museum will feature Star Wars and Hollywood memorabilia, paintings, vintage photographs and films from Lucas’ personal collection. The building will be designed by Ma Yansong of MAD Architects. 
According to a statement released by the Lucas Museum, the museum will also include amenities such as a fine dining restaurant, a casual cafe, state-of-the-art cinematic theaters, lecture halls, digital classrooms, video conferencing, a 4,200-square-foot library, production quality editing classrooms, event rental spaces and a museum store.
“Art exists to inspire, to move, to educate and to excite,” Garcetti said. “I am deeply grateful to Mellody and George, and to our educational, governmental and cultural leaders for their extraordinary support in helping us bring the museum home. Millions of Angelenos and visitors will enjoy an extraordinary collection anchored in storytelling — an art that carries so much meaning in the history and legacy of Los Angeles. This is a collection of narrative art in a city that has the best storytellers and storymakers in the world.”
