The USC women’s volleyball team is one of the most successful programs in the school’s athletic history. Since 1981, the Women of Troy have made nine Final Four appearances and won three National Championships, good for fourth most all-time.
Two of those national championships came under current head coach Mick Haley. Despite the success the program has had under Haley, USC hasn’t won a championship since 2003. But despite the 10-year drought, the Women of Troy have made a name for themselves as one of the top women’s volleyball programs in the nation.
Last season, the team finished with a stellar record of 30-6, but didn’t advance to the Final Four, falling to eventual champion Texas in the Elite Eight.
But the Women of Troy performed much better than Haley had expected. A year before, in 2011, USC had a very successful team that advanced to the national semifinals. After the season, the team lost many key starters and was preparing for a year of rebuilding — but things changed.
When asked to pinpoint a reason why the team exceeded his expectations last season, Haley’s answer was simple.
“[Samantha] Bricio changed everything,” Haley said. “As a freshman, she was just remarkable.”
Bricio was the team’s most dangerous offensive weapon in 2012, leading the team in kills, service aces and points. Despite her breakout season, Haley admitted that he might have overworked the talented underclassman, and that exhaustion was one of the reasons that the team didn’t advance further into the postseason.
But last season was a great learning experience for both the coaches and the players. During the offseason, the returning members of the squad improved their skills and grew closer as a team. With a plethora of starters returning this season, including senior libero Natalie Hagglund, senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard, senior outside hitter Sara Shaw and junior setter Hayley Crone, another deep run in the NCAA tournament is the goal.
“We need to build off of last season and keep in mind that the game is not over until the last point goes down,” Hagglund said. “Last season, when we were down during a game, we didn’t fight back as hard as we should have.”
Haley will lean on his returners to combat lapses in effort and to improve upon last season’s NCAA tournament run. But a talented group of newcomers will also be expected to contribute immediately, and one freshman in particular appears poised to make a splash.
“We all need to look out for freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu,” Haley said.
During the summer, Nwanebu was named the Most Valuable Player of the USA Volleyball Junior National Championships after leading her team to the national title. As a prep star in Fairview, Texas, Nwanebu was an Under Armour All-American and was named the Volleyball Magazine High School Player of the Year.
The other freshmen on the roster are outside hitter Elise Ruddins, setter Alice Pizzasegola and liberos Anne Marie Schmidt, Kelly Wimmer and Taylor Whittingham.
“It’s going to be a fun season because the team we have this year is different,” Haley said. “As a whole, we’re more experienced and more motivated.”
After finishing third in the Pac-12 last year behind Stanford and Oregon, USC was picked to finish second behind the Cardinal in the preseason conference poll, receiving two of 12 first-place votes.
“I’m most excited for the UCLA and Stanford matchups because they are not only rivals, but they are also top contenders within the Pac-12 conference,” Hagglund said.
In the American Volleyball Coaches Association national poll, the Women of Troy are ranked No. 4, after defending national champion Texas, Penn State and Stanford.
There’s no doubt that the expectations are higher this year, and the team is looking forward to the challenges it will be facing and hopefully overcoming with the support of their fans.
The Women of Troy open up the season on the road against Purdue on Aug. 30. The first home game is against UC Irvine on Sept. 18, a game that will be televised nationally on ESPNU.
Surely the Trojans have worked hard and are coming off an excellent season. Now it’s time to see what the payoff will be — they’re hoping that it’s a national championship.

What was once a 180-degree role reversal has now come full circle for Dion Bailey. The redshirt junior, who was recruited to USC as a defensive back but converted to linebacker two seasons ago, switched back to his original position last spring after the Trojans changed defensive schemes.
Back to the basics · Recruited as a safety out of high school, redshirt junior Dion Bailey feels more comfortable in the backline of USC’s new defense. Bailey led the team with four interceptions last season. – Daily Trojan File Photo
After missing all of spring practice while recovering from shoulder surgery, Bailey is set to start as one of the team’s safeties — a more than welcome change.
“It’s my more natural position,” Bailey said. “The coaches felt like it was a great time for the move, so I was excited to go back.”
Bailey, a product of Lakewood High School in Carson, Calif. was ranked by ESPN as the No. 31 safety in the high school class of 2010.
After spending his redshirt season at safety, USC head coach Lane Kiffin approached him about making the switch to linebacker. With more and more Pac-12 teams implementing up-tempo offenses, Kiffin thought adding another speedy ball hawk to the front seven would help cover opposing offenses that frequently use four- or five-receiver sets.
Though the reasoning was sound, Bailey wasn’t exactly excited about leaving the spot he had grown so accustomed to playing in high school.
“I really just made the best out of [playing] linebacker,” Bailey said. “Just did whatever it takes to help the team.”
Though he might not have enjoyed it, he proved to be a prominent defensive force during the two years he started as linebacker.
During his redshirt freshman season in 2011, Bailey recorded 81 tackles, tied with Hayes Pullard for most on the team, along with two sacks and two interceptions. For his efforts, he was named the Pac-12 Defensive Freshman of the Year.
Bailey was again stellar in the 2012 campaign, recording four interceptions and 80 tackles, good for third on the team. But the unit as a whole struggled, surrendering 24.3 points a game en route to a disappointing 7-6 season. Though the team ranked fifth in the nation in sacks, its turnover margin was a subpar minus-two.
“If you look at the stats in the past century, the best two teams when it comes down to the end of the year have the best turnover margin,” Bailey said. “It’s all about the ball. Whoever protects the ball and gets the ball out the most wins the game.”
Defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast, a former coordinator for the Arizona Cardinals, Kansas City Chiefs and most recently the California Golden Bears, replaces Monte Kiffin and has implemented a 5-2 defense in place of the old 4-3 system.
The hope is that the increased amount of players on the line of scrimmage will put more pressure on opposing quarterbacks and play into USC’s strengths.
Bailey is confident the new system will also play to his personal strengths. Listed at 6-foot and 200 lbs, he has the measurements to play in the NFL but probably lacks the size to make it as a linebacker at the next level.
“[Linebacker] was never a position I felt I would play at the next level,” Bailey said. “I’m 200 pounds. I don’t think I could have survived at that position much longer.”
Bailey lost some of the weight he had put on to make it as a linebacker, and feels like he has regained the speed he needs to cover the best receivers in the Pac-12. Though his footwork in the defensive backfield is admittedly a bit rusty, the 5-2 scheme calls for more man-to-man coverage, which has made the new system easy for him to pick up.
“Coach [Monte] Kiffin’s concepts were more zone [coverage], so it was a lot more keys and reads that every position has to make, and it takes a lot more thought,” Bailey said. “This defense is a lot more simple, so it allows us to play a lot faster.”
With last year’s safeties T.J. McDonald and Jawanza Starling both graduated and in the NFL, Bailey is expected to slide into one of the starting spots, with freshman Su’a Cravens, redshirt junior Josh Shaw and senior Demetrius Wright all in the discussion to start alongside him.
From the 5-2, one of the two safeties will frequently come up and play alongside the two linebackers, making the hybrid spot perfect for Bailey.
“The safety position fits him well in this defense,” junior linebacker Lamar Dawson said. “He comes down in the box just like a linebacker, he’s just doing a lot more coverage.”
Bailey’s experience at linebacker has expanded his skill set, which should help him both this season and with his future draft stock.
“Getting physical, fighting off blocks, all that stuff I learned over the past two years at linebacker definitely will help me in the secondary,” Bailey said.
Though shoulder surgery brought Bailey back to feeling 100 percent physically, it did cost him a lot of practice time in the spring and Pendergast believes Bailey needs a little more time before he’s in game shape.
“He really missed the reps in the spring, so that shows up,” Pendergast said. “The more he’s in a natural position to play there, the more he’ll improve.”
And Pendergast is convinced the defensive stalwart will be ready in time for the season opener against Hawaii on Aug. 29.
“He’s continuing to work at it and just has got to continue to get reps,” Pendergast said. “It’s a lot different being that far back off the ball and seeing the whole field, but he’s working at it diligently, and he’ll continue to make progress.”

After arguably the worst performance ever by a team ranked No. 1 in the preseason, there were bound to be major changes to the program after USC’s shockingly mediocre 2012 season.
Many of the Trojan faithful were calling for USC head coach Lane Kiffin to be fired after overseeing a campaign that yielded the most losses by a preseason No. 1 in NCAA history, but had to settle for the resignation of his father Monte.
The hiring of new defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast away from California didn’t exactly quell the concerns of USC fans, given the fact that the Golden Bears’ defense actually gave up more points per game (33.1) than the Trojans (24.3) last year.
But look further into the numbers and study the personnel on USC’s roster and there’s reason to believe that Pendergast’s 5-2 scheme might slow the roll of spread offenses currently in wide usage across the Pac-12.
For starters, California allowed the fewest yards per game in the conference under Pendergast in both 2010 and 2011.
“When I looked at all the candidates and saw what [Pendergast] did in a very short time, I thought that was a very big part of the hire,” Kiffin said. “We obviously didn’t want something that took years to develop; we wanted something that would work now.”
And even though the Bears regressed in their third year under Pendergast, there were flashes of greatness that suggested that his scheme could trigger major headaches for opponents, even when facing more talented offenses. The same UCLA squad that put up 38 points on USC last year turned the ball over six times against the Bears in a 43-17 rout.
”We want to be a turnover-oriented defense,” Pendergast said. “That’s something we harp on every day, something we’re trying to create a lot of.”
USC fans will be happy to hear Pendergast has already shown he can quickly install a defense that can stop the vaunted attack of Oregon.
In 2010, Pendergast’s first year on the job in the Bay Area, California held the Ducks to 15 points, and only one offensive touchdown, in a narrow 2-point loss. That’s one of only three times in the past three years the Ducks have been held to less than 27 points.
The other two teams that pulled off the feat? Last year’s Rose Bowl champions (Stanford) and 2010’s BCS champions (Auburn).
The Trojans are confident that they can become a defense with a similar pedigree this year.
“I feel like we have the personnel that if we can give tenacity and get after the ball, it doesn’t matter what offense we play,” redshirt senior Devon Kennard, who now plays as an outside linebacker after playing at defensive end before Pendergast’s arrival, said. “I think one of the best things about this [scheme] is that it reignited every player on the defense. It puts everyone in position to make plays.”
Pendergast’s scheme aims to rack up turnovers by incorporating a hefty amount of blitzing from linebackers combined with tight man coverage in the secondary, as opposed to the more conservative, predominantly zone-coverage system previously incorporated by the elder Kiffin.
“[Pendergast] is a lot more aggressive [as a] playcaller, and we just try to dictate what the offense can do to us,” junior linebacker Lamar Dawson said. “When we go man coverage, that means the ball is coming out fast, because we’re putting a lot of pressure on the quarterback, so that gives us more opportunities for interceptions.”
Players on USC’s offense quickly took notice of the hectic pace Pendergast has instilled in the defense.
“We see them every day in practice. They’ve been relentless,” redshirt sophomore quarterback Max Wittek said. “They’ve been like that all summer and even in the spring, so that was good to see.”
Kiffin and Pendergast have been reluctant to name starters, insisting that all 11 spots on defense are up for grabs.
Several previously unheralded players, such as redshirt sophomore linebacker Anthony Sarao and senior safety Demetrius Wright, have unexpectedly shined and made these decisions tougher for the coaching staff.
“It’s been a great transition,” redshirt junior linebacker Hayes Pullard said. “They’ve simplified this defense for us guys to go out there and play fast and play to the best of our ability.”
If Pendergast’s 5-2 system is indeed the catalyst that brings out the talent littered across USC’s defense, it might not make much of a difference which of USC’s many 4- and 5-star recruits claim the starting gigs.
For the first time since Kiffin took over at Troy, USC’s defense might be more of a sure thing than its offense. And Trojan fans who witnessed last season know that this is not necessarily a bad thing.
Nice article.

With more than 35 years of experience coaching women’s volleyball, there is not much in the business that USC head coach Mick Haley has not experienced.
From Kellogg Community College in Battle Creek, Mich., to the U.S. Olympic team, Haley has mentored hundreds of players, coached almost every squad he’s overseen to national prominence and won four NCAA championships.
But as he enters his 13th year at the helm of the USC women’s program, Haley insists he’s having just as much fun as the day he started.
“Every time you start a new team and lose seniors and you have to redo the team, it’s always a new challenge,” Haley said. “It’s one of the most exciting things you can have. Some jobs, you get one opportunity for a new challenge, but we’re challenged every year with assembling the team and getting the players to gel.”
After 16 years at Texas and four years with the Olympic team, Haley joined USC in 2001 and immediately turned the program into one of the best in the nation. He guided the Women of Troy to back-to-back national championships in 2002 and 2003, as well as third-place finishes in 2004, 2007 and 2010.
“The volleyball part is easy. You have to be constantly smart about playing by the numbers,” Haley said. “If you look at football coaches, why does Urban Meyer win? He puts people in the right spots. Pete Carroll was also good at putting people in the right spots. We tend to do a pretty good job with that as well.”
After a strong 2012 campaign in which they finished 30-6, the Women of Troy suffered a disappointing end to their season, falling 3-0 to Texas in the NCAA Regional Finals. Haley will have to adjust to the departure of outside hitter Katie Fuller, one of the team’s most critical performers last year, and determine how to incorporate six freshmen into USC’s rotation. True to form, he is more than ready for the challenge.
“The reason why it’s exciting is because it stimulates the heck out of you,” Haley said. “You get to see what you can create each year with the people you have. We get dynamic, young people who are excited to pursue excellence athletically and academically. It becomes a very unique challenge for us to see if we can teach with the time we have and bring the team together.”
USC retains six starters from a season ago, highlighted by senior libero Natalie Hagglund, the reigning Pac-12 libero of the year, and sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio, who garnered 2012 Volleyball Magazine and Pac-12 Freshman of the Year honors.
Hagglund, who alongside Bricio was named to the preseason all-conference team by league coaches, praised Haley’s impact on her life as both a volleyball player and a student.
“Mick is one of the best coaches I’ve ever had, and he’s taught me that there’s more to life than just volleyball,” Hagglund said. “He’s taught me that in order to win, you have to work hard every single day and not give up at any point. He’s quite hard on us in practice, but he cares a lot for the team as well as our lives beyond volleyball.”
Though adjusting to player turnover and integrating incoming freshmen is a tough task for any coach, Haley is optimistic about the team’s potential this year and particularly praised the squad’s upperclassmen.
“I’m excited that Natalie Hagglund has worked so hard to improve, as well as [senior middle blocker] Alexis Olgard and [senior outside hitter] Sara Shaw. That gives me tremendous hope because it’s hardest to get improvement from your oldest players,” Haley said.
With the majority of the battle-tested core returning intact, Haley is excited to see how his latest recruiting class will gel with the experienced veterans on the court.
“[Freshman outside hitter] Ebony Nwanebu is an unbelievable talent, and [freshman outside hitter] Elise Ruddins is a tall body and has also had a lot of success,” Haley said. “We have a talented center in [junior setter] Hayley Crone, and we’ve got a great middle blocking situation as well.”
Nwanebu, a 6’4” outside hitter from Fairview, Texas, looks forward to the beginning of her USC career under Haley’s tutelage.
“Coach Haley is actually the reason why I came to USC,” Nwanebu said. “He’s an amazing coach, and I think he’s one of the best coaches in the country. I really look forward to playing under him.”
After almost 30 successful seasons coaching powerhouses Texas and USC, Haley always maintains the drive to win the national championship each year. After all his years in the sport, and with the NCAA title becoming more and more difficult to capture, he never tires of the competition.
“It’s really fun. It’s not like, ‘What have you got left to do?’ We want to win every year,” Haley said. “But there are 347 teams and only one’s going to be on top at the end. We start every August with a 12-month approach, but the parts are always different and that’s what’s unique about it.”
Though many of USC’s top athletic programs are in a state of change, the women’s volleyball program can rest easy knowing that Haley, the rock of stability, is still here, anxiously awaiting the next challenge ahead.

The USC women’s soccer team ended the 2012 season on a thrilling note, with students storming McAlister Field after a buzzer-beating goal from then-junior midfielder Jordan Marada sunk No. 2 UCLA in overtime. The upset victory over the Bruins was a sweet consolation for a team that missed out on the NCAA tournament largely because of their inability to win close games.
Redirect · USC senior midfielder Jordan Marada hopes to lead her team to a resurgent 2013 season. Marada started every game last season for the Women of Troy and notched a team-leading five goals and five assists. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Leading up to their breakthrough against UCLA, the Women of Troy had lost three consecutive games by a score of 1-0, including a heartbreaking double overtime loss to No. 1 Stanford in the team’s showcase match of the season at the Coliseum. The team won just two of its nine overtime games and lost by a single goal nine times en route to a 6-10-3 (3-6-2 in the Pac-12) record.
Though dismayed by the results, USC head coach Ali Khosroshahin, who made NCAA history by winning a national title in his first season at USC in 2007, saw the silver lining in such a bittersweet year.
“I think our players have learned valuable lessons from such a tough season with so many close matches,” Khosroshahin said. “The players have matured, both individually and as a team, and they are more determined than any team we’ve had here in a while.”
Sophomore defender Erin Owen, who started 18 games last season, also feels that  her teammates learned important lessons from the 2012 season.
“Last year’s losses have taught us to start the games the way we end them. Being focused from the start will hopefully allow us to get an early lead and not rush at the end of the game to score goals,” Owen said. “Those losses have been our motivation to work hard and focus on the small details.”
A wealth of experience certainly inspires confidence for the 2013 Women of Troy, who return several starters and key players. This comes as a welcome sign for Khosroshahin, whose 2012 roster featured mostly underclassmen.
Co-leading senior scorer Marada returns, as do several other midfielders: seniors Elizabeth Eddy, Autumn Altamirano and Haley Boysen, as well as junior Alex Quincey. Along the backline, junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley anchors a defense that will remain largely intact from a season ago. Defenders redshirt junior Mia Bruno and sophomore Marlee Carrillo return, each having logged significant minutes last season.
Though the team lost last year’s co-leading scorer Samantha Johnson, the Women of Troy will still have plenty of scoring options. Sophomores Katie Johnson, Megan Borman, Whitney Pitalo and Jamie Fink combined for 45 starts and eight goals from the forward position in their first seasons with the team.
With an abundance of experience giving the team a boost on the field, the continuity on the roster has also paid dividends in building camaraderie among the players, with bonds being strengthened through the trials and tribulations of last season.
“Since last season, our class really focused on trying to help the upperclassmen with their leadership roles,” Owen said. “Our commitment to do what was in the best interest of the program proved to our teammates that we will always have their backs, and this built a lot of trust between us that led to a very successful spring season.”
The team opens up the season on the road against a San Diego State squad that is ranked No. 11 in the preseason polls, and things do not get easier from there — for better or worse, the Women of Troy will be receiving a fair amount of exposure against highly ranked teams in 2013.
Nine of the team’s 20 scheduled games will be televised on the   Pac-12 Network, including road tests against No. 20 California, No. 2 Stanford and No. 5 UCLA. The Pac-12, as usual, figures to be one of the toughest conferences in the nation. UCLA has spent much of past two seasons ranked                                                                       No. 1 in the country, while Stanford is two seasons removed from a national title and coming off yet another Final Four appearance. The Trojans will have to be at their best throughout the conference schedule to compete with these perennial powerhouses.
Khosroshahin recognizes the difficulty of his team’s schedule but is confident his team can play with the best in the nation.
“We’re USC. It really doesn’t matter who we play,” Khosroshahin said. “We are prepared to meet any challenges we face this year.”
Khosroshahin’s players echo those sentiments. Johnson believes the team’s rigorous offseason training will help them compete with the best.
“During the preseason, we have set high standards in our fitness testing so that we can compete against the highest-level teams,” Johnson said. “We have been preparing for this season since our last game against UCLA, and we are ready to showcase our hard work.”
The Women of Troy’s game experience, along with their relative youth, should have students and fans excited for the future of the program. Though it will not be easy, the team has the right ingredients to once again ascend the college soccer ladder after enjoying the view from the top six years ago.
And, after a sub-.500 season last year, the team is not mincing words when it comes to expectations for 2013.
“Our goal this season as a team is to win a national championship as well as a Pac-12 championship,” Johnson said. “But in order to do so, we have to be disciplined in every game and execute our game plan.”

As the first decade of the 21st century came to a close in 2009, things were looking positively rosy for USC’s football program.
The Trojans had just finished one of the most dominating runs in college football history under coach Pete Carroll, who compiled a 97-19 record (83.6 winning percentage) at USC that featured two national championships and three Heisman winners.
Excluding 2009, the last seven years of his reign were especially impressive — seven consecutive conference titles, 11-win seasons, top-4 finishes in the AP Poll and BCS bowl appearances.
As a result, USC was named college football’s “Team of the Decade” by CBS Sports and “Program of the Decade” by Sports Illustrated.
The team had gone just 8-4 in the 2009 regular season, but freshman phenom quarterback Matt Barkley closed out the year by leading the Trojans to a 24-13 victory over Boston College in the Emerald Bowl.
Even though Oregon and Stanford defeated USC by a total of 61 points while beginning their ascension as mainstays atop the Pac-12, the future looked bright. Barkley looked poised to be the next great USC quarterback to lead the team to a BCS bowl alongside Carroll.
But a new decade brought new problems that tarnished both the future and the past.
On Jan. 12, 2010, news broke that Carroll had accepted a job with the Seattle Seahawks. Just two days later, Lane Kiffin was announced as his replacement, leading to concerns that the search committee rushed its decision.
That summer, the real bombshell dropped — two years without postseason play, four years of probation, the loss of 30 scholarships over three years, and 14 victories from USC’s glory days with Reggie Bush wiped from the record books.
In the three seasons that followed, the Trojans won 25 of 38 games for a .658 winning percentage; far worse than Oregon (.900) and Stanford (.875) and closer to the likes of Washington (.538) and Arizona State (.526).
And last year, UCLA stated its case to take over the title of best team in Los Angeles both in results on the field — a 38-28 victory at the Rose Bowl — and in recruiting — UCLA’s 2013 class was ranked No. 3 by Scout.com while USC lingered below at No. 18.
“Being able to get that win against [USC] last year was great, and it was huge for our program,” said UCLA offensive lineman Xavier Su’a-Filo. “I think USC is a good team every year. But I’ve noticed a difference in my own team. We’re able to compete with [USC].”
Part of that gap in the recruiting ranks stems from the limitations caused by USC’s scholarship reductions, as the Trojans only signed 12 players compared to the Bruins’ 28. But that doesn’t explain the bevy of last-minute decommitments that downgraded USC’s class from spectacular to something a few notches below.
The Trojans were still able to ink eight recruits ranked in the top-100, but if USC puts up another disappointing season this year, one can expect that figure to decrease next year.
“I’m sure that where our program was viewed 12 months ago and where it is right now has an impact,” Kiffin said. “I do think that last year’s season impacted the end of last year’s class. Not playing well, job security questions … No matter how well your staff does, there’s going to be some impact when that happens.”
USC’s late-season slump undoubtedly affected the perception of the program; in the Pac-12 preseason poll, the Trojans were picked to finish third in the South Division behind UCLA and Arizona State.
But USC players said they aren’t letting what others think affect them, and they point out that the media hasn’t been able to predict how the Trojans will perform for a couple of years now.
“We’re underdogs, a little more under the radar this year,” said redshirt senior tackle Kevin Graf. “But that’s how we were two years ago when we went 10-2. People weren’t expecting much of us; they thought the sanctions would really tear us apart. But it made us grow a lot more together, and I think we’re gonna do the same this year.”
They’re also ready to dispel the notion that the program is on the downswing.
“USC is USC, and it’s gonna be that way for a long time,” said redshirt senior defensive end Devon Kennard. “But we have competition now. We just have to get back to the way we play football.”
Perhaps the 2010 and 2012 seasons were just bumps in the road; after all, the first two years of the 2000s yielded just 11 wins and 13 losses before Carson Palmer broke out and led the Trojans to a 11-2 campaign in Carroll’s second year on the job.
Maybe we’re about to witness a similar jump by a new USC quarterback and the reconstructed defense.
But with Kiffin seemingly one bump away from being moved from the program’s driver’s seat to the hot seat, USC fans might want to buckle up. The Bruins, Ducks and Cardinal are coming up fast in the rearview mirror.

The USC men’s water polo season ended last year with a heart-stopping last-second triumph over crosstown rival UCLA. The 11-10 victory capped off a perfect season, in which the Trojans went 29-0 to claim the national championship.
While the team’s most recent campaign was undoubtedly impressive, its success shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone. USC climbed further into the record books of collegiate sports history by winning an unprecedented fifth consecutive national championship.
Success is no longer a goal; it is simply a reality for a program that undoubtedly enters each year with national championship expectations.
This season the Trojans will have to deal with some key losses — most notably driver Michael Rosenthal, who was named the NCAA Tournament’s Most Valuable Player. But despite his departure, the goal for the program remains the same: To capture the national championship.
These lofty expectations, however, don’t figure into the mindset of the Trojans, who are simply focused on getting better each day.
“We don’t think about the bust [not winning a national championship],” head coach Jovan Vavic said. “We focus on the training and the time and just believe that we are going to win every game.”
Vavic, having just won his 12th coach of the year award, will rely heavily on his son, senior driver Nikola Vavic.
The younger Vavic returns after an incredible junior season, in which he set a USC single-season scoring record with 83 goals, leaving him just 48 goals away from taking over as USC’s all-time leading scorer.
Senior two-meter Jeremy Davie, who ranked fifth on the team last year with 29 goals, will also be depended upon in the squad’s quest for a sixth consecutive national title after earning All-American Honorable Mention and All-MPSF First Team honors last year.
“We lost some key players,” Davie said. “But we have young players ready to step up and play and it’s exciting.”
One of those exciting young players is freshman Jon Walters from national powerhouse Mater Dei High School. Walters won numerous player of the year honors and led the Monarchs to an undefeated season and CIF championship, and is expected to contribute right away.
Moreover, there will be greater opportunities for                                lesser-known returning players to have expanded roles. Redshirt sophomores Russell Renteria and Chase Watson, two-meters who saw limited action last year, are expected to get a chance to contribute to the team in a much greater capacity this year.
Though these newcomers will be essential to the continued success of the Trojans, the strength of the team most certainly lies in its returning veterans.
“Fourth-year guys like Rex Butler, Nikola [Vavic], our goalie [James] Clark … that’s going to be the strength of our team,” Vavic said. “But guys like Russell [Renteria] and Mac Carden are still going to be given a great opportunity this year.”
Davie’s Australian mate in the cage, goalie James Clark, will be pivotal for the Trojans. The 6-foot-5 senior enters his second season for the Trojans, having transferred from the University of West Sydney as a sophomore, as a player expected to shine in his final season. Clark will have to make good on those expectations if the Trojans are to have another successful campaign.
Their top competition nationally will come from right at home in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, which contains USC’s biggest rivals in the Pac-12 and is considered the most competitive water polo conference in the nation.
USC enters the season at their usual spot, ranked No. 1 nationally, but with UCLA, Cal and Stanford right behind the Trojans at No. 2, 3 and 4, respectively.
The Trojans are scheduled to scrimmage both UCLA and Cal in the preseason, but the true tests will come in November, with games scheduled against Stanford and UCLA.
The game on Nov. 21 against UCLA will be especially challenging, as it takes place in the hostile confines of Westwood. It will be the first official meeting between the two teams since last year’s NCAA final, one of the most dramatic games in recent memory.
Being the defending champion undoubtedly puts a target on a team’s collective back, regardless of sport or school. But being a five-time consecutive champion will put an unprecedented amount of pressure on the Trojans. Still, they remain unfazed, even though they enter each game knowing they have a target on their backs.
“Being a Trojan means from the start that the other team is out of its game already,” Davie said. “It’s more pride than pressure to perform. It means a lot to all of us to be Trojans.”
When the Trojans open up their season on Sept. 7 with a game against Cal Baptist as part of the Triton Invitational, they will begin their fifth straight championship defense. No program at USC has made winning look as easy or effortless as the men’s water polo team, a fact that is both a blessing and a curse.
Any other team might be content with one championship, let alone five, but USC men’s water polo is not any other team. Come next December, the assumption and expectation for this team is a national championship. And judging by the team’s talent and attitude, this team looks well- equipped to do just that.

There’s a scene from the classic football film Friday Night Lights that perfectly captures what USC head coach Lane Kiffin and his team are going through.
Lead by example · USC redshirt junior linebacker Hayes Pullard, one of the most experienced players on the team, lets his play do the talking. – Daily Trojan File Photo
 
The season for the Permian Panthers has just ended in bitter disappointment, and Permian head coach Gary Gaines is taking down the nameplates of departing players from the team’s depth chart on the wall. At the same time, the camera pans over those same players walking out of the stadium.
The weight of the scene is not in Gaines’ concern about replacing the on-field production of those players. The poignancy actually comes from his realization that the leadership, the heart and soul of his team, is gone, and it’s his job now to find new players to pick up the pieces.
The Trojans find themselves in a similar predicament for the fall season.
All four team captains from last season have moved onto the NFL: quarterback Matt Barkley to the Eagles, center Khaled Holmes to the Colts, safety T.J. McDonald to the Rams and cornerback Nickell Robey to the Bills. These players made up the core of the team’s leadership, along with fellow departures Robert Woods and Jawanza Starling, leaving Kiffin with the tough task of developing replacements.
Though the head coach of a football team bears most of the burden of leadership, it takes more than that for a team to be successful. It’s imperative that the players themselves be accountable for their actions, something that is not overlooked by this year’s group.
“You have to get on guys and tell them to keep pushing,” junior wide receiver Marqise Lee said. “And you have to do it without the coaches. [Doing it] with the coaches is good, but I feel as if players can really bond when it’s just the players.”
With the leadership among the team in a transitional phase, the simple question that remains is this: Which players can step up and lead this team?
The Trojans have plenty of potential leaders to choose from. Though they lost great players and great leaders from a season ago, the process of developing new ones is not an unfamiliar task.
“Every year is different,” Kiffin said. “We’re facing that with losing a lot of really good players from last year and really good leaders. As we move into fall, it’s our job to make sure developing those guys as great leaders is prominent.”
Redshirt senior defensive end Devon Kennard could possibly fill part of the leadership void. Kennard missed all of last season with a torn pectoral muscle, but remained a vocal part of the team throughout its many on-field struggles.
“He was a leader already last year, and we still look up to him as a leader,” said redshirt junior linebacker Hayes Pullard, one of the more experienced and vocal players on the team. “He‘s one of the main guys I look up to. Just having him back is a relief. He’s been through the ups and downs throughout the seasons and he knows how this tradition is supposed to be run.”
Kennard said he isn’t putting any added pressure on himself to step into McDonald and Robey’s shoes.
“I’m not T.J. I’m not Nickell,” Kennard said. “I’m just going to be the best Devon Kennard I can be, and I think my teammates respect that. We’ve got a great chemistry on the defensive side of the ball.”
On the offensive side, senior tailback Silas Redd finds himself in a unique position. One year ago, he was forced to adapt quickly to his new surroundings, having transferred to USC from Penn State in the wake of NCAA sanctions placed upon the Nittany Lions. Now, he’s about to embark on his final college season, a veteran among an offense filled with more than just a few newcomers.
“The thing about Silas is he’s a leader,” Kiffin said. “He’s very confident, very emotional. Now that he’s had an offseason around the guys, even though he’s battled some injuries, I think he’ll have a bigger leadership role, and also he’ll have a more successful season if he can stay healthy.”
Though Redd is expected to get the bulk of the carries this season, he also has the luxury of relying on a deep stable of backs behind him, most of whom have little to no game experience. That casts Redd in the suitable role of mentor.
“Whatever those guys need, [my teammates] can come to me,” Redd said. “I know my stuff really well and I have experience to answer questions some of the younger guys might have. Anything that I can do to help them, I’m going to do.”
Redd’s role in the offense is a crucial one. He’s battle-tested and reliable, two traits that cannot yet be said of whomever USC’s starting quarterback ends up being. One of the leading candidates, redshirt sophomore Cody Kessler, is fully aware of what is expected of him should he win the job.
“It’s definitely a big loss when you lose [team leaders] like that, but at the same time, it gives opportunities for new guys to step up,” Kessler said. “We don’t have a lot of game experience like Matt [Barkley] did, but we don’t have a choice. When you’re the quarterback, guys are going to look to you when things go wrong, so you’re going to get thrown into that spot.”
With Redd, Pullard, Kennard and company in tow, it appears as if a new regime is already starting to take shape. Despite the great players who have departed, a changing of the guard might be just what this team needs to shake off the bitter feelings of the season that has come to be known simply as “7-6.”
The motto the team adopted at the onset of that ill-fated year, “Prep, not hype,” never quite stuck. The play of the 2012 Trojans never came close to reaching its enormous preseason hype.
This year’s rallying cry, “Don’t talk about it. Be about it,” though, seems to hold more water. When asked if wearing the captain’s “C” on his jersey was a goal, Pullard responded firmly.
“The ‘C’ doesn’t mean anything,” Pullard said. “You have to show that on the field. All that is leading by example. A leader is shown by his actions. Whether I’m wearing the ‘C’ or not, I’m just trying to go out and show the guys the Trojan way.”

The USC football team’s first scrimmage of fall camp earlier this August saw a very notable player absent after the first couple drives: junior wide receiver Marqise Lee. USC head coach Lane Kiffin explained that a handful of players were withheld from the majority of snaps to give other players without as much experience exposure to the intensity of a live game.
Breaking away · USC receiver Marqise Lee, who holds the Pac-12 single-season receptions and receiving yards records, won the 2012 Biletnikoff Award as the nation’s top receiver and is a legitimate Heisman contender in 2013. – Daily Trojan File Photo
 
“We were looking for about 20 plays in the first half, much like how an NFL preseason game would be run,” Kiffin said.
The latter part of the comment is fitting for Lee; after all, it seems only a matter of time before the 2012 Biletnikoff Award winner is sitting on the sideline with NFL starters after the first few snaps of a preseason game.
In the more immediate future, however, Lee will line up with the Trojans this fall, coming off one of the most impressive statistical seasons by a wideout in Pac-12 history. His performance this season could rewrite the Pac-12’s career receiving record books.
Lee is 1,131 yards, 68 receptions and 16 touchdowns away from the Pac-12 career receiving record in each category. For the sake of comparison, Lee had 1,721 yards, 118 receptions and 14 touchdowns last season. The first two categories could be accomplished even with a drop-off in production from last season’s efforts.
That is not to say Lee is satisfied with his efforts from last season. A visit to the Trojans’ summer training camps this past offseason would suggest that Lee has no idea that he was a consensus All-American in 2012, or that he’s on track to be the most decorated receiver in Pac-12 history.
His intensity and work ethic in workouts and scrimmages could be likened to that of a walk-on wide receiver fighting for a spot on the team — not the man who almost singlehandedly outgained Arizona’s opposing quarterback in a record-smashing 345-yard performance last October in Tucson.
Still, there’s something calm, yet fearsome about how Lee approaches the game, even in practices. From the top-down view afforded to many spectators during the regular season, it seems Lee propels himself through various slants and fades from the rapid piston-like action of his legs.
From the up-close vantage point of a practice, however, the opposite becomes apparent: Lee’s strides seem to slow down.
In one particular 11-on-11 drill, Lee made a spotless catch on a post over the middle and began to increase separation between himself and his assigned cornerback. It was not immediately apparent how hard Lee was actually running until seeing the cornerback, whose hunched back and faltering gaze was reminiscent of a marathoner summoning his last breaths to cross the finish line.
Lee’s lithe, elegant strides made his pursuant defenders appear to be running on an undersized treadmill. If possible, Lee looks like more of a polished runner this offseason than he did in 2012. He returns with even surer hands and has further developed his reflexes and creativity in the open field.
The argument against Lee producing more than he did last season begins with how opposing defenses will anticipate his abilities this season.
Yet even against Cal last season, who held former quarterback Matt Barkley to just 192 yards, Lee managed 94 yards and two touchdowns.
Lee was able to snatch underthrown and overthrown balls out of the sky in double coverage last season, and he has made a routine of it with the shuffling of quarterbacks during spring and summer camps. A look at how opposing defenses attempted to stop Lee last season should reasonably assure the Trojan faithful that there is simply no way to prepare for a version of Lee who is any better than he was in 2012.
None of this, though, is Lee’s stated intention. Despite what appears to be even further refinement of his personal execution, it’s the progress of the team that concerns Lee most. Sophomore wide receiver Nelson Agholor bears testament to Lee’s commitment to team goals.
“Whatever Marqise does, it’s always for the team,” Agholor said. “He does whatever it takes to make the team better.”
These are not just errantly thrown, PR-friendly sentiments. Lee is bringing intensity to every other facet of his game, including going full speed on blocks in practice snaps. He is afforded the luxury of basking in his efforts from last season, yet seems uncomfortable at the thought. When asked how his season could reshape Pac-12 history, Lee sidesteps any notions of a personal legacy as deftly as an oncoming safety in the open field.
“As far as records and stuff, that’s something I don’t focus on,” Lee said. “At the end of the day, I do want to leave a legacy here, but what I would like people to remember in the long run is the things I did for the team.”
The team kicks off its campaign Aug. 29 at Hawaii. Lee will be ready, and his long legs will stride in pursuit of the one statistic that, despite his stupendous efforts, was relatively low last season: A team victory.

Even though people are more thrifty with their purchases nowadays, that hasn’t stopped them from buying electronic devices such as tablets and gaming machines. With the next generation of video game consoles, though, it’s still a hard sell for consumers to buy a Playstation 4 or an Xbox One since neither is backward compatible, meaning they won’t work with your old PS3 or 360 games. The companies are currently trying to sell these devices to the public and convince them that their hardware is better.
So far, Sony and Microsoft have had a difficult experience in selling their new consoles, with a few critics believing that they’re not a huge leap forward and that certain features seem downright detrimental to gamers and the consumer.
In fact, the backlash against the Xbox One’s required Internet connection (which would’ve required a daily Internet login to play your game) and used game policy (you could only loan your game to one other person unless they paid a fee) was so severe, Microsoft backtracked and took out the controversial features.
Still, the arms race of features and specifications is on. In the years since the release of the Xbox 360, consoles have changed from gaming machines into full-fledged entertainment hubs.
 
Looking at the two consoles objectively, there are not many technical difference between the PS4 and the Xbox One. Both feature eight-core x86 processors, a 500GB hard drive, a Blu-ray drive, 4K-compatible HDMI outputs, 8 GB rams and minimal matte black cases. Considering that the graphics of the current generation are already at a hyper-realistic level (just look at Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us or the upcoming Grand Theft Auto V), developers will have to create innovative virtual experiences to make the most of the technical upgrade.
The PS4 and the Xbox One will be more integrated with the Internet than ever before. Both consoles will use cloud processing, which will allow you to stream games directly to your console. Sony claims that you’ll be able to stream PS4 titles directly from the cloud server without even installing the game. It should be noted that the Xbox One was going to have this feature, but due to the fallout of getting rid of the always-online requirement, the console will require the game disc or the digital version to be installed.
This reliance on cloud processing does, however, raise a red flag. Though Sony has expressed confidence in its online servers, there’s no way to tell if it can handle hundreds of thousands of simultaneous streams on a consistent basis. The last thing the company needs is a SimCity-esque disaster, in which gamers couldn’t access their games for days due to server overload.
One benefit of cloud processing is that both consoles will allow you to record your gameplay automatically to share with the world, using the  PS4’s new DualShock 4 controller, which has a dedicated “share” button to upload your video online. The Xbox One will feature the program Twitch, which will allow you to edit your gameplay video on the spot.
While both will have an assortment of entertainment features and apps, Microsoft is setting the X1 up as the definitive entertainment center for your entire living room. Along with the app store, the console will have a feature called Snap mode that will allow you to multitask. For example, you could be playing Assassin’s Creed IV and Skype-ing with a friend simultaneously or playing Madden NFL while watching the Trojans on the ESPN app.
It’ll even have an extra HDMI port for users to connect to your TV DVR receiver, so your console will not only function as an extra receiver for your home, but it’ll also manage your channels and recorded shows and fully integrate with the Kinect 2.0.
You will, however, need to have an Xbox Live Gold account to be able to use these features. On the other hand, the PS4 won’t require a Plus subscription to use services like Netflix or Hulu Plus, but you will need one to play online multiplayer, which is a change from the PS3 where you didn’t need one.
The Kinect 2.0, which is more accommodating for smaller rooms (so you’ll be able to use it comfortably in your cramped dormitory), will no longer be required but it is meant to make the most of the Xbox One since its entire OS is built around it. They have greatly expanded its capabilities, though, with facial recognition and a 1080p HD camera (with Skype integration) for greater precision.
Its initial requirement is the reason that the Xbox One will be selling for $499 at launch compared to the PS4, which will sell for $399. Sony was actually planning to have its own motion-capture camera but removed it from the launch bundle to gain a competitive pricing edge against Microsoft.
These consoles aren’t just for video games anymore; both Microsoft and Sony are setting these machines up not to compete with Nintendo but with Apple and cable companies. The Xbox One and Playstation 4 are setting themselves up to be your storage hub, television provider and gaming machine all at once. Both consoles can even turn your phone or tablet into a secondary controller, much like the AirPlay feature on the Apple TV.
So if you decide to wait it out, get a reservation or try to fight the crowds on release day, you’re not just buying a gaming machine, but the future of entertainment. Of course, it’s up to the companies and developers to make the most of that potential.
“Sony was actually planning to have its own motion-capture camera but removed it from the launch bundle to gain a competitive pricing edge against Microsoft.”
This statement is only a false rumor. Sony has already stated that this is not true. They wanted this camera to be optional because it’s not for everyone. What they presented after Microsoft’s E3 was already planned well before the presentation.

Graduating with a degree in civil engineering, especially considering the rigorous coursework expected of students of the Viterbi School of Engineering, seldom leads to students feeling uncertain about their post-graduate futures — but that was exactly the spot Leaf Ye was in two years ago when he graduated from USC.
Mixing it up · Owner Leaf Ye blends L.E.N.O.’s most popular food item, the acai bowl, for a customer. In addition, L.E.N.O. also offers a popular kale salad and fresh cut fruits in its refrigerator display case. – Euno Lee | Daily Trojan
“I didn’t want to just find a job and work 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. I just wanted to do something for myself,” Ye said.
That something was L.E.N.O. Juice Bar, a small shop tucked away in West 27th Place serving up cold-pressed juices made from exclusively organic fruits and vegetables. The store’s name is an acronym for “Life Energy Natural Organic,” which reads like the primary buzzwords in the Southern Californian juicing craze. L.E.N.O. opened its doors near campus earlier this summer and has been preaching the gospel of the benefits of juice as part of a balanced lifestyle ever since.
“Everything has to be balanced in the diet; you can’t always eat junk food, so we suggest every once in a while people do a juice cleanse. The key point of the cleanser isn’t only to help you lose weight or ‘be nutritious,’ but to help you balance your diet,” Ye said.
A juice cleanse is basically fasting and drinking juices as meal replacements. At L.E.N.O., this involves drinking one bottle of “green” juice and following it with another bottle of either a different juice with additional nutritional benefit, or a bottle of L.E.N.O.’s store-made almond milk as a source of protein. As for its effectiveness, Ye cites himself as an example.
“I used to eat a lot of meat, a lot of burgers like In-N-Out and Five Guys. But after I got into juice, the way I looked at food changed. After I started juicing regularly, I didn’t want [hamburgers],” Ye said.
And though it might sound unbelievable, Ye’s comments make sense given the context: juicing isn’t naturally tasty by any means, and there certainly won’t be many juicing acolytes zealous enough to trade in their occasional Double-Double for a bottle of “Breakthrough Green” juice. But juicing itself signifies at least a partial commitment to better health.
At L.E.N.O., this commitment can be financial: Their juices start at $7.50. Ye believes his prices are competitive when considering that other comparable juice bars are charging from $9-$12 to a similar product. As for how to market an $8 bottle of juice to a college student, Ye explains that juicing itself is costly by nature, but L.E.N.O. juice is worth the investment.
“Here, it’s a campus area, and I was a student here, so I know how students think and they might think it’s too expensive, so we try to keep our prices lower. Actually the cost of each bottle of juice was really high, but there’s a difference here because it’s fresh and it’s made in-store with organic produce. Also, we are using a cold-press hydraulic machine to press and produce our juice,” Ye said.
L.E.N.O.’s machine is an industrial hydraulic cold-press model, the cost of which runs well upward of $2,000 and efficiently extracts the most nutrients from the fruit without the application of heat. This process ensures that heat-sensitive enzymes and nutrients aren’t burned off in the juicing process. All of L.E.N.O.’s products are then bottled on-site for ease of purchase.
Cold-pressed vegetable juices aren’t going to win over the masses on the basis of taste, but Ye believes exposure to the benefits of juicing paired with the convenience of his storefront model will win more people over to the movement so that it’s more than just another passing fad.
“I juiced a lot myself, and I know it’s good for me, so I started a juice bar to express these ideas to more people,” Ye said. “Many people aren’t familiar with the concepts of juicing, so we need to show our products, and the benefits of the juice and educate our customers.”
For those who have bought into the craze already, juicing at home has been the method de rigueur, as such an approach allows the consumer to source the ingredients themselves. But the costly equipment (even a serviceable, modest-yield home juicer can run upwards of $250), cleaning and the difficulty of maintaining a stock of fresh ingredients makes the humble juice stand a sustainable business concept.
And L.E.N.O.’s storefront is humble. The location is a bit of a tight squeeze, with seating relegated to a pair of small oak tables and matching backless stools. Jazz piano clangs away over the store’s speaker system, and the store is brightly lit and inviting.
As fate would have it, L.E.N.O. is located adjacent to the Five Guys at West 27th Place. The message is clear: for a change of pace from greasy burgers and fries, students might want to take a couple steps past the Five Guys and one small step towards a more balanced diet at L.E.N.O. juice bar.

Terroni has been serving up some of the best southern Italian fare in Los Angeles at its West Hollywood location since 2007, and the success of its Toronto-based restaurant gave birth to a second downtown location which opened in Jun. Upon entering, the warm staff provides comfortable and unintimidating service. The establishment itself is quite large, with high and elaborate ceilings, many sleek wooden tables and even an upstairs area with a wine cellar. Six thousand square feet provides more than enough space to turn this former 1920s L.A. National Bank headquarters into a contemporary restaurant.
The sound of plates and utensils clinking complements modern, beating music playing in the background. Suited businessmen enjoy their meals while aspiring actors attend to them. Customers can also learn more about the restaurant by reading its very own Terroni magazine. It contains information on the people behind Terroni, and even includes a page of cleverly written statistics including: “Percentage of employees that sport tattoos: 98.7%,” and “Percentage of staff who wouldn’t kick David Beckham out of bed: 100%.” Terroni obviously caters to hip and well-to-do individuals.
The menu consists of a wide variety of southern Italian specialties. Once you look past the elaborate Italian words, it can be easily broken down into pasta, pizza and salad, as well as meat and fish, such as the raw prosciutto and orso lunch. Of course, the important decision of what to order is aided by the presence of sliced bread (baked fresh daily in the kitchen) as well as a smooth but pungent olive oil imported straight from Italy. The caprese salad is an ideal starter that highlights Terroni’s fresh ingredients. The plate comes piled with basil, arugula, succulent tomato slices and moist buffalo mozzarella all tossed in a vinaigrette.
As a main course, the tagliatelle al ragu is recommended. The pasta is made on site and has just the right amount of beef bolognese and deliciously melted parmesan cheese on top. The margherita pizza is made the authentic Italian way — lots of sauce, a thin rustic crust and patches of fresh mozzarella cheese — all with the signature basil leaf right in the center. A 12-inch pizza might seem like too much for one person, but do not be deceived. The pizza is pretty thin and can easily be consumed by a single customer with a hearty appetite.
As for those who try to avoid carbs, the filetto di branzino is a sea bass grilled to perfection accompanied by a medley of diced peppers, zucchini and eggplant. Even for those who usually shy away from seafood on a menu, this meal is pretty satisfying and is worth taking a chance on. The sea bass has a slight outer crunch covering the incredibly tender meat that avoids tasting too fishy.
Once tasted, it is clear that all of Terroni’s entrees are prepared with the highest of standards, but dessert elevates the experience to the next level. The dessert menu ranges from classic ice cream to a rich flourless chocolate cake. The most remarkable of the desserts are the Nutella fritters — yes, Nutella fritters. This dessert is the stuff of dreams — fried crispy balls of dough covered in sugar and cut in half with a warm dollop of Nutella sandwiched in between. As if this wasn’t mind-blowing enough, these four fritters are served with a scoop of Nutella ice cream. The beloved hazelnut chocolate spread was not overwhelming, and the flavor was balanced out with the sweet fried dough balanced out the flavor, the ice cream serving as a cool and creamy complement.
At the end of the day, though, the amazing experience that is Terroni comes at a high price, most dishes average between $15 and $20. This is not exactly ideal for a college student on a budget. Terroni, however, serves as the perfect place to take a friend for an upscale birthday dinner or to take family when they come visit. For a nice occasion or for those willing to splurge a little extra, it is surely worth it. Though it has only been open for a couple of months, Terroni will likely be bustling for months to come.

Freshmen get an intensive one-week education on USC and the surrounding community as a part of their orientation to campus. But unfortunately for students, there’s no Welcome Week for Los Angeles. Many of us only know Los Angeles as it is portrayed in pop culture, and even within that realm there is such a diversity of representations. Some of us might see Kendrick Lamar and Dr. Dre as symbols of Los Angeles. Others might think of Paris and Perez Hilton, while others might think of Kobe Bryant or Gustavo Dudamel. The city has a knack for producing world-famous cultural figures, but it can be difficult to get an unadulterated view of the city’s authentic culture.
The culture of the stage and the culture of the streets are quite different things. Luckily, there is another, far less publicized and free USC service that may bring one even closer to the city’s elusive cultural identity: the Union Station-UPC bus service. Here’s a breakdown of its stops and some awesome places that you can get to:
UNION STATION
The brief ride departs from the corner of West 34th Street and Trousdale Parkway and also picks up at 34th Street and McClintock, and goes straight to the Union Station Bus depot, which is an oasis of flowers and Jerusalem stone amid the harsh industrial blocks east of the tracks. Two curving staircases lead into a long tunnel that accesses the Metro Rail, Metrolink and Amtrak platforms. A fast-paced walk through the tunnel offers an overwhelming tableau of city’s diversity: rich, poor, commuters, families and people of all races and ages hurrying to get somewhere by a means that is decidedly un-L.A.
The tunnel ends at Union Station itself, the famous art deco structure with Spanish-style detailing. It is a very small structure, indicative of L.A.’s historic relationship with public transit. Homeless people are everywhere, inside and outside of the station, and some might even offer to sell you a beer after commenting on your USC T-shirt.
OLVERA STREET
Across the street from the station is the micro-neighborhood known as El Pueblo de Los Angeles. Essentially Los Angeles’ oldest neighborhood, it is currently a kitschy tourist attraction. El Pueblo, however, and its main thoroughfare, Olvera Street, represent a side of the city that is often overlooked in popular culture: The side that existed before the Warner Brothers. It was a sleepier Los Angeles, a center of agriculture and commerce, where being at the forefront of contemporary aesthetics was not a major concern. That old-fashioned spirit still exists on Olvera Street, where the charming old buildings make no airs about being hip. Families stroll down Olvera Street, eating churros and examining the plastic wares of the street vendors. This little neighborhood, so utterly lacking in the glitz and irony of twenty-first century life, is unsurprisingly surrounded by large parking lots and pedestrian-unfriendly streets. In such areas, certain L.A. stereotypes may come to mind, like the city’s drab strip mall architecture or its dehumanizing car culture. But these streets quickly give way to the pitched roofs and bronze lions of Chinatown.
Like El Pueblo, Chinatown is a sort of civic symbol, a reminder that the real Los Angeles is about so much more than TMZ glamour. The neighborhood feels gritty and mysterious, perhaps because its community is underrepresented in media that depicts Los Angeles.  Many of the ornate buildings house restaurants, apothecaries and markets. The streets, however, are relatively quiet, given the recent exodus of the Chinatown community to Alhambra and other points east.
In both neighborhoods, Metro buses are a surprisingly frequent sight. Eventually, “America’s largest clean-air fleet” becomes a believable slogan. Most Metro lines originate and terminate at the farther reaches of the metropolis, but they cross Downtown along the way and will take you just about anywhere. Rides are very slow and cost $1.50, but there may be no better place to immerse oneself in such an authentic facet of L.A. culture.
One ride from Chinatown to Glendale revealed that there is a special camaraderie when Angelenos get out of their cars and interact with one another. During the course of a one-hour ride, two people lent bus fare to complete strangers, a number of riders had lengthy conversations with the driver and a young woman with a baby held court, allowing other riders to play with her child. The bus’ two small screens broadcast Transit TV — part advertising network, part Metro propaganda — which added another interesting layer to the scene.
What do these somewhat unconventional L.A. locales and experiences tell us about the city’s culture? Perhaps that places which may seem ugly, old or impoverished are, in fact, full of a vivacity and authenticity that a neighborhood such as, say, Westwood, could never muster. There seems to be a special kind of togetherness that develops in a place of such dramatic scale and reputation. The slowness of the bus and the drabness of the streetscape create a unique dynamic in which people and their behavior can become the primary focus of the cityscape. Perhaps this emphasis on human interaction has helped to make Los Angeles the center of popular culture as it strives to represent human interaction in an entertaining way. There is far more to see and experience here than MTV would lead one to believe. The best thing about it? It’s all only a free shuttle ride away.

It’s 1 p.m. There’s a French bulldog snoring under the table and a couple of inflatable exercise balls scattered around the room. No, this is not a dog-friendly yoga class — instead, this is BuzzMob, an up-and-coming startup based in Irvine, Calif.
Silicon Beach Boys · Buzzmob Founder and CEO Jeff Jackel (left) based his start-up in Irvine, California. The location enabled him to focus development between Los Angeles and Orange County. – Courtesy of Buzzmob | Daily Trojan
“[The environment] has to do with our personalities,” Jeff Jackel, CEO of BuzzMob and USC alumnus said. “We know that the space is fun, and we have to make the office interesting. … We have some idea of what a startup looks like.”
Aside from the five televisions on the second floor, the two motorcycles and the stocked kitchen downstairs, BuzzMob looks like any other office. But despite the energy that’s present in the office, BuzzMob pulls off a relaxed yet productive vibe — one that can be considered few and far between in a region as conservative and corporate-based as Orange County.
These days, most Southern Californian tech startups settle down in an area known as Silicon Beach, the three-mile stretch of Santa Monica and Venice that is home to startups such as Snapchat, Instacanvas and Beachmint.
Though the name “Silicon Beach” is a somewhat pejorative spin-off of the original Silicon Valley, Silicon Beach nevertheless represents a like-mindedness among Angelenos — a collective celebration and appreciation for technology as well as innovation.
BuzzMob is nothing short of innovative, which is what makes this company stand out as one of few startups based in Orange County.
The idea for BuzzMob came from an epiphany at a baseball game.
“It was one of those moments that there was a lull in the game, and [Jeff] looked around and saw that everyone was on their phone doing something and not paying attention to the game,” said Edmond Wong, COO of BuzzMob. “He saw a need for something to connect everybody there and enhance the experience for more than the price of the ticket, be it rich media content or being able to talk to people about plays or share photos.”
At the time, Jackel owned an apparel company and approached Wong with the idea in 2010. The two, who were already friends, shared the desire to start something together, and gave this idea for a real-world social media connection platform a go.
From there, the BuzzMob app was born.
Though Orange County, particularly Irvine, boasts major tech companies, including Broadcom and Blizzard Entertainment, the startup scene there isn’t quite as prevalent due to a lack of willing mentors and venture capitalists as well as accelerators to help grow these smaller companies.
Location and resources, on the other hand, weren’t the first factors that came to mind when the founding BuzzMob members established the company’s headquarters. Jackel and Wong said that they chose their location based on where they already lived.
“One easy answer is that we live here and we’re from around here, and it’s a lot easier to get around,” Wong said.
The team has, however, struggled in one area as an Orange County-based startup: finding talent. “[Talent] is scarce, and it’s hard to grab somebody,” Jackel said. “For mobile development, specifically, someone might be available for three days and then be taken to another company, and it’s becoming more difficult because more companies are moving into Orange County.”
But settling in Orange County turned out to serve a dual purpose. Since BuzzMob works best at events where people can connect and socialize, being close to two major cities also met the needs of their social platform.
“For us, it makes a lot of sense to be in the middle of Los Angeles and San Diego because when we were originally hitting a lot of sports venues and concerts, we were in the middle of two metro areas where a lot of events take place,” Jackel said.
And perhaps this reason alone — to connect with others — is why being based in Orange County makes sense for BuzzMob.
“We’ve had to distill [the app] down to understand what is the connective thread for a good experience,” Jackel said. “But from what we’ve come to understand, BuzzMob should digitally connect communities that already exist and are important to you, but you may not be there.”
In other words, BuzzMob is meant to connect others virtually. If you’re not at a certain event or you don’t live in a certain area, the BuzzMob application allows its users to never miss out on anything. Users can watch the action during a football game or concert unfold on the app even if they couldn’t score tickets to the event.
And like its product, the BuzzMob team, without having to move to Silicon Beach, hasn’t missed a beat in the SoCal startup world. Jackel has spoken at panels during Social Media Week, a bi-annual social and mobile media conference in Los Angeles, and often attends events such as Silicon Beach Fest with his team.
With BuzzMob and a few others leading the pack, the next generation of tech startups in Orange County will crop up in due time. Throw in a couple of startup incubators, recruit more talent and you might see French bulldogs become as common as having motorcycles and exercise balls in the office.

Trends come and go in numerous aspects of our world. Fashion renews itself with every season. Hashtags gain — and lose — popularity faster than the latest YouTube video. Trends should be analyzed because they reveal important aspects of our modern society (Kardashians aside — it’s best if we just leave that fascination alone).
The latest fads and styles have the potential to become yesterday’s trash or tomorrow’s standard. And in a city such as Los Angeles, rife with constantly shifting trends and plenty of culture, there is so much to learn.
Which brings us to the trending subject at hand: Indoor cycling classes. Exercise is necessary, if you’re into being healthy and sh-t like that, but often it is quite a pain to fit into busy schedules. Let’s be real; a trip to In-n-Out after a long day at work or school grants instant gratification, compared to a workout that requires, well, more work.
On the other hand, food doesn’t provide our bodies with the endorphins we crave. This is the allure of finding the right exercise that fits you specifically. And what better time to get back on that exercise grind than when school is starting? A return to school means having to look presentable every day, since you never know who you’ll run into on campus or sit next to in class.
Indoor cycling classes have been around for years, but lately they are making a fast and furious comeback. As is the case with so many trends, their popularity is on the rise after a period of being on the backburner. Naturally, USC students have caught on to this resurfacing workout quicker than Lance Armstrong rolling down a hill.
Commonly referred to as spin classes, indoor cycling courses are essentially Jazzercise on a stationary bike. You’re placed in a room full of mirrors (all the better to admire your sweaty self — because you will sweat, a lot) and at least 20 other riders that will probably be in better shape than you (all the better to motivate you when you’re exhausted after 10 minutes).
The idea is that for 45 minutes to an hour, you will be pedaling a bike at various speeds while listening to the instructor’s choice of music and performing certain exercise maneuvers. Your feet are strapped to the pedals to ensure maximum control and the music is fast-paced and upbeat so that you feel energized. Easy enough, right?
That’s what I thought before- taking both a regular spin class and a SoulCycle class. Then again, before these experiences I also thought that a spin class meant sitting in front of a pottery wheel à la the movie Ghost. Though I survived both of my classes without Patrick Swayze’s guiding hands, the path was not easy.
One of my closest friends, Bridget, has now been an indoor cycling instructor for eight months. She teaches at the Downtown L.A. YAS Fitness Center, which offers athletic yoga and indoor cycling classes. Since running is basically the only exercise I can ever force myself to do, I figured a spin class would be fairly easy because of its dependence upon leg strength.
I was partially right. Though keeping in constant motion wasn’t necessarily difficult, the coordination requirement caught me off guard. Spin classes involve a series of up-down, side-to-side, left-right movements atop a bike while maintaining proper form. When your bike is at a low resistance gradient that imitates going downhill, try bouncing up and down without shaking your a– like Miley Cyrus attempting to twerk. The riders behind me definitely got an eyeful.
Needless to say, I required lots of special attention from Bridget so as not to overwhelm myself and the poor bike I was riding.
After my first foray into the world of indoor cycling, I thought I was prepared for the SoulCycle experience. Located in West Hollywood, Brentwood and Santa Monica, I had heard friends mention that these spin classes were rejuvenating and, strangely, conducted without the lights on.
Once I was shown around the premises, handed a towel and strapped onto my bike by one of the helpful employees (who even gave me a free water bottle after I foolishly forgot to bring one), I was ready. The lights were, in fact, turned off, leaving the room only to be lit by a few electric candles. Our instructor, David, led the class with spirit and contagious enthusiasm. He let everyone go at their own pace, while also encouraging them to push themselves to their limits. The studio was, as he put it, our “sweaty, dance music, cycle sanctuary.”
By the halfway mark of class, it already felt like I had gone swimming in a pool of my own sweat. My muscles were incinerated and my water bottle was nearly empty. The movements I had struggled with during my first spin class still confused my clumsy body, but the darkness helped me feel secure enough to swerve like an idiot and not care.
But, strangely enough, I loved every minute of it. My mind was clear and in focus and my body, though exhausted beyond belief, felt energized.
Just like Bridget had done during that first session, David talked to us throughout the class. He gave us instructions, encouraged us and reminded us that we were a community. That’s the beauty of a spin class and, I suppose, the reason that these classses are a trend that has stuck around: Indoor cycling classes are simultaneously an individual and a group effort.
The inspiration to push further must be found on your own, from a personal motivation; but the rhythm and strength of the class are palpable effects of being around others pedaling toward the same finish line. Spin classes satisfy the basic human need to connect with others during times of stress.
My legs were certainly still shaking half an hour later, but I felt fulfilled after each class, physically and mentally. Also, I bet my butt looked great.

What happened to diversity at the box office? What happened to thinking outside the box? Instead of spending $14.50 to see a trite blockbuster at nearby L.A. Live, think Outside the Box Office. The Outside the Box Office event series isn’t new by any means, but continues to be one of USC’s underappreciated treasures. And now, it feels all the more important amid this year’s summer slump.

An event series produced by the USC School of Cinematic Arts and Alex Ago, director of programming and special projects, Outside the Box Office provides cinephiles and casual moviegoers with a much-needed respite from the mind-numbing entertainment Hollywood spews out. There are weekly screenings that feature a wide array of upcoming international, documentary and independent films from the prestigious Sundance, Cannes, Berlin, SXSW and Venice Film Festivals.
This summer’s marquees boasted epic titles promising action and adventure supplemented by star-studded casts and yet these films still fell flat. The upcoming autumn forecast offers no break in the monotony either, when the thrilling, suspenseful and horrifying flicks will dominate the silver screen. If the thought of being challenged or inspired by something different doesn’t pique any interest, maybe this additional incentive will leave an impact: All Outside the Box Office screenings are free, and all that’s required is a reservation.
“You can see a ton of independent movies and big-hit movies before they’re available to the public,” senior Ben Meissner, who has been working for the event staff for OTBO for more than a year, said. “We get a lot of movies that are only released pre-showing at the cinema school so it’s a unique opportunity to get ahead on a lot of movies you wouldn’t be able to see in L.A.”
And washed-up action films are ubiquitous in Los Angeles. To be clear, however, this summer trend is no new phenomenon. In 2012, audiences flocked to the theaters for Marvel’s The Avengers and Christopher Nolan’s Batman finale, The Dark Knight Rises. Though not as popular as the two superhero blockbusters, the box office also invited The Bourne Legacy, The Expendables 2, Total Recall and the disastrous Battleship. This lapse in creativity was easy to overlook due to the overwhelming success of The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises, but now the lack of options at the movies becomes glaring in the absence of quality entertainment.
As the weather turns, so will the films circulating theaters. Major distributors promise thrillers, including Closed Circuit and Getaway with Selena Gomez, and horror films such as Satanic and Insidious 2.  This year, going to the movies felt tired and stale. Audiences yawned at action flops such as The Lone Ranger with Johnny Depp, R.I.P.D. with Ryan Reynolds, After Earth with Will Smith and son Jaden Smith, and White House Down with Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx.
That’s why USC’s own Outside the Box Office is such a valuable resource. Ago curates films that challenge the predictable and formulaic Hollywood norm. This summer alone welcomed documentaries, television episodes, festival favorites, award winners but also did not shy away from the big production movies that can be caught in most major theatres. There’s a bit of everything for everyone—or at least anyone who closely follows the event calendar.
Highlights this summer included The Way, Way Back, a touching drama comedy in which a teenage boy must survive the summer with his mother’s stern boyfriend. The film, which originally debuted at Sundance before being picked up by Sony, is driven by an impressive cast including Steve Carrell, Sam Rockwell, Maya Rudolph and Toni Collette. It has since become a quirky box office favorite, a la the charming Little Miss Sunshine.
Outside the Box Office’s summer season also showcased critically acclaimed films such as The Spectacular Now, a coming-of-age romance and Fruitvale Station, a chilling drama based on the true events of a young black male’s death at the hands of a transit cop in Oakland. Other films that have been screened during the series include smaller gems such as Prince Avalanche and In a World… and bigger box office hits, such as 2 Guns with Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington and the apocalyptic comedy This Is The End with James Franco and Seth Rogen.
Outside the Box Office also welcomes guest speakers from the night’s showcased film who can offer firsthand insight into the moviemaking process after the screening. The speakers include directors, producers and actors. This summer, Ago interviewed Academy Award-winning screenwriter and Community star Jim Rash and Prince Avalanche actor Emile Hirsch.
When the summer Outside the Box Office showcase winds down in the coming months, the public can look forward to The Grandmaster, a cinematic and visual wonder that captures China’s beauty with sweeping landscapes and delicate camerawork as it tells the epic tale of kung fu master Ip Man, who trained Bruce Lee.
Other feature films include The Teacher, about a high school teacher who gets tangled in an affair with one of her students and Otelo Burning, about a teen surfer embroiled in the political controversies of South Africa when Nelson Mandela is released from prison. Also, Outside the Box office screened two documentaries: one that traces the lives of three families who struggle to acclimate to rapid globalization in Cambodia (A River Changes Course) and the Don Cheadle-narrated documentary about a Haitian man who returns to the country to supply clean water in the aftermath of the earthquake (La Source).
These films aren’t all guaranteed to be hidden jewels, but they’re innovative and experimental, or can at least give the casual viewer a different experience than going out to the movies. It all comes down to this: Deferring to big-name movies requires paying a considerable chunk of money to experience exactly what was anticipated. Taking advantage of Outside the Box Office is an opportunity to watch a film that’s unconventional or challenging without dropping a penny.
“Outside the Box Office broadens your horizons,” Meissner said. “You get to see a lot of movies that don’t even sound like they would be up your alley before you go. You show up just knowing a line or two about the plot and end up really liking it.”

Elysium, writer-director Neill Blomkamp’s eagerly anticipated follow-up to District 9, is another bold, bloody sci-fi action flick packed with sociopolitical commentary on issues ranging from healthcare and immigration reform to class warfare. The film, set in the dystopian future of 2154, explores the poverty gap between the ultra-wealthy, who have migrated to an orbiting space habitat known as Elysium, and the rest of mankind, who are left to toil in the factories and shantytowns of a desperately overpopulated Earth.

Visually arresting but thematically heavy-handed, Blomkamp’s movie is nonetheless a welcome addition to this summer’s crop of blockbusters, mainly because it’s one of the few not based on a pre-existing TV show, video game, toy line, board game or worldwide bestseller. The reason for this dearth of fresh material is not, as some have argued, a lack of imagination within the industry, but rather the studios’ longstanding reluctance to greenlight original or unestablished properties that lack the assurance of built-in audiences.
Steven Spielberg and George Lucas raised plenty of eyebrows during last June’s unveiling of the School of Cinematic Arts’ Interactive Media Building, where the two legendary filmmakers, often cited as the progenitors of the modern blockbuster, railed against Hollywood’s dependence on mega-budgeted, mass-appeal entertainment. Spielberg predicted the inevitable “implosion” of the studio system, and an industry-wide paradigm shift towards online and VOD content (and the niche markets they represent) that would be heralded by a series of high-profile theatrical flops.
If this summer’s box office returns are any indication, the pair’s apocalyptic auguring might not be that far off. Though profits are continuing to soar thanks to franchise stalwarts such as Iron Man 3, Monsters University and Fast & Furious  6, a number of unestablished tentpole releases have either dramatically underperformed (White House Down) or tanked outright (R.I.P.D.) in the face of critical scorn and general audience malaise.
Mitchell Block, an adjunct professor in the School of Cinematic Arts’ Peter Stark Producing Program, stresses the importance of “pre-selling” viewers through brand familiarity.
“Our whole world works on selling brand names,” Block said. “In the history of film, there have only been a handful of brand names. Hitchcock, Disney and Pixar, for example. And adaptation is everything. If you adapt a story from a previously successful movie or literary property, it’s much easier to sell. It’s hard to be excited about something you’ve never heard of.”
In a season sustained by a constant deluge of sequels, prequels and reboots, some of the summer’s costliest casualties have been franchise non-starters, such as Disney’s universally derided The Lone Ranger. Gore Verbinski’s and Johnny Depp’s bloated, tonally haphazard action-western risked upward of $215 million on a supposedly built-in audience that flocked to see Despicable Me 2 instead. Standalone efforts like Sony Pictures’ $130 million After Earth, the Will and Jaden Smith sci-fi vehicle that grossed a paltry $27 million during its first weekend, also did not fare well against Fast & Furious 6, which was in its third week of release.
“The Lone Ranger was just a bad movie,” Block says. “A brand name will only get you so far, and star power still requires something people want to see.”
With their smaller budgets and speedier production schedules, horror and comedy are often more conducive to telling original stories, as evidenced by several of the summer’s most successful releases. Paul Feig’s The Heat drew on Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock’s combined talents to charm both male and female audiences, spoofing the masculine excesses of the buddy cop flick and ultimately raking in $153 million (the movie’s budget was $43 million, pricey for a comedy but negligible compared to the average superhero sequel). The $3 million budget home invasion thriller The Purge, meanwhile, earned upwards of $64 million, while James Wan’s suspense-laden haunted house chiller The Conjuring grossed more than $120 million thanks to strong word-of-mouth surrounding the $20 million film’s atmospheric creepiness and a top-drawer cast (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga) that added gravitas to the goosebumps.
So how does Elysium stack up against the summer’s biggest winners and losers? Despite the financial boost of an IMAX release and the fearsome sight of District 9 star Sharlto Copley playing a samurai sword-wielding mercenary with the vocabulary of a deranged football hooligan, Blomkamp’s sophomore effort nabbed a solid but unremarkable $29 million during its opening weekend, topping the box office but failing to match District 9 ’s impressive $37 million haul from four years ago. Those figures are even more disheartening considering District 9 only cost around $30 million to produce in the first place, whereas Elysium’s production budget weighed in at a comparatively hefty $115 million.
A below-average domestic opening doesn’t mean all is lost, however. Elysium grossed an additional $10 million overseas, meaning the film still has a reasonable shot at succeeding at the global box office. If it does, it will be in excellent company. Though considered an underachiever stateside, Guillermo Del Toro’s Pacific Rim has proven a bonafide triumph in China, Japan and the rest of East Asia, where the Mexican auteur’s dazzling monster mash has earned a stunning $247 million thus far, prompting Warner Bros. and their ex-partner Legendary Pictures to reconsider the idea of a sequel.
Pacific Rim’s journey from underperformer to probable franchise breeder illustrates the rapid ascendance of foreign markets, a shift Hollywood has been quick to capitalize on, allowing moviegoers in countries like Australia, Germany and India to preview films like Skyfall and Star Trek Into Darkness weeks before their official U.S. release dates. Foreign audiences are also more likely to embrace the sound and fury of action blockbusters, where giant robots, busty love interests and interminable gunplay transcend all but the most stringent lingual and cultural barriers.
Perhaps this renewed focus on the global box office reflects the studio system’s final push to preserve the mass-appeal blockbuster, the same model Spielberg and Lucas seem convinced is ripe for a reckoning. How many more mega-flops like The Lone Ranger and last year’s John Carter can the industry successfully weather? What hope is there for large-scale original content in a business increasingly reliant on the safe and familiar? Will Hollywood ever again show us something with the grim vitality of Apocalypse Now or the sprawling ambition of Lawrence of Arabia? The answers seem about as remote and unattainable as Elysium itself.

It would help if the original movies were actually good. Pacific Rim had great robot scenes, but the characters were as bland as a bloody mary without tobasco.
