Stagecoach Music Festival is in full force out at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California. Taking over what was two weekends of Coachella, the country music festival is completely sold out. For the cowboys that were lucky enough to have snatched tickets, you better be well on your way to Indio. For those who were not as fortunate, AXS TV will be broadcasting select performers throughout the weekend.
The set times were released on Wednesday, and can be found in the attached photos. It features the festival’s biggest names on the pun-intended “Mane Stage,” and is much less likely than Coachella’s set times to put you between a rock and a hard place. That doesn’t mean, however, that you can take your time going from set to set. Tim McGraw’s closing performance on the main stage is bound to be just as crowded as Coachella’s main stage. And if any of you were there for Kaskade or The Weeknd’s set, you know what I’m talking about.
On a final note, make sure to catch the Brad and Angelina of Country Music – Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton.

Happiness is part of health, and nothing brings more happiness than a gift when you least expect it. Last week, one of my friends was dealing with some family issues and having a really hard time during school. I wanted to do something nice for her to turn her week around and I came across the most adorable gift idea called a little box of sunshine.
It’s incredibly easy and perfect for cheering a friend up during finals time. A Box of Sunshine is just what it like sounds — a box of yellow things that provide comfort and happiness to make someone smile. I went to our local USC stores a.k.a. CVS, Fresh & Easy, Goodwill and the USC bookstore in search of any kind of fun yellow items. I ended up getting yellow candies, like peanut M&M’s, Mr. Goodbar, Juicy Fruit and Sour Patch Kids. I looked for yellow things I thought she would actually use — nail polish, a journal, some cute yellow jewelry, pencils, chap stick and some other fun little things. Check out the pictures below for more ideas. Also put the print out the little sign on and put it on it. Something so small like this can go a long way and can really make somebody’s day.
In addition to this box of sunshine, there are of course millions of things you can do to make someone’s day during finals time. Here is a list of a few small things that can go a long way.
Happy studiers equal more successful students.

It’s getting to that point in the semester. The point when I have been rechristened “Leavey troll,” where I switch between counting days until summer and pulling my hair out at the sheer amount that needs to be accomplished in those days. Safe to say distinct meals are no longer a part of the day. If they ever were?
Hi, I’m Shalaka, and I’m a stress eater. It’s something I refuse to be ashamed of, because it’s the little pleasures that keep you going when things get gray (and teal and horrific pink, like the walls of my favorite building on campus). And most of the time, the little pleasures lie in chocolate. Chocolate will never introduce added stress into your life, it won’t refuse to show up to group project meetings and it won’t mark down your paper. Chocolate’s the true homie. Except when chocolate isn’t homies with my un-stretchy slacks.But slacks everywhere can rejoice, because I’ve got a solution for you, and it lies in that miraculous and exotic fruit known as the date. Less elusive and stressful than the eponymous social concept!

To the inexperienced eye, dates can look like shriveled brown hunks of fruity flesh. Yum. Are you sold yet? But to the knowledgeable user, hidden inside is nature’s take on the gooiest, sweetest caramel. In honor of Earth Day this week, a salute to Mama Earth for killing the fruit game, always.
We’re going to take the date and make fudge, no sugar added (because they bring plenty of their own), with wiggle room for plenty of personalization, for all your finals stress eating needs.
To begin your date initiation, the ‘Medjool’ variety are often the softest and sweetest, and Ralph’s sometimes has some! But even if you catch a sad/dry batch of dates (is this getting too real?) there are fixes: soak them in hot water for about 10 minutes before proceeding with the recipe. Does this technique work on boys? Someone please try and keep me posted.
Ingredients and volumes in this recipe are flexible/approximations, based on the consistency and strength of flavor you hope to achieve.

Directions:
Here’s a dessert that’s roommate-approved, vegan and slacks-friendly — what more could you want?

Some people have asked me what my favorite city I’ve traveled to so far is. I can’t exactly say I have a favorite (besides London, of course). Dublin had the friendliest people. Amsterdam was the prettiest. Bruges the most fairytale-esque and Paris the most romantic. And Berlin? Definitely the most interesting.
Coming to Berlin (it was the first stop on a weeklong Berlin – Prague – Budapest trip), I didn’t think much of it. Most of what is heard about the city was about hipsters and clubbing. I barely took anytime to think about the history of the city besides resolving to see the Berlin Wall.
Today Germany is a peaceful, powerful country — probably the most successful euro zone country even. Which, for a nation that’s only been reunited for about 25 years, is extremely impressive. But just under the surface of Germany’s recent prosperity is quite a tumultuous twentieth century history. World War I, the Weimar Republic, the Nazis and World War II, and the Cold War. And no place seems to exhibit that more than the capital through it all, Berlin.
It’s hard to walk a single block in Berlin without seeing the presence of this history. The former east side of the city, where most of the main sites today are located is covered in graffiti and street art. While many buildings are new and nice, some older, dilapidated ones still exist, mainly in the shades of brown preferred by the Soviet Union. Besides just from the general look of the are you’re in, you can always tell which side of the city you’re in my the pedestrian crosswalk signs: The east side has the cute Ampelmannchen figure telling you when to stop and when to walk.
There are signs of history going even further back than that. The current tax building used to be Nazi party headquarters. You can stand above Hitler’s former bunker, where he killed himself.
But while this can be jarring for a tourist, Berliners seem to think nothing of it. They go about their daily lives, the constant historical reminders not seeming to register much with them. The resilience of the population and the readiness to move on is I think what makes Berlin so amazing.
