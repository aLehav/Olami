The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Monday, Nov. 17. and Tuesday, Nov. 18. 
Crimes against property
At 7:37 a.m. on Nov. 17, Retail Unit officers who were monitoring surveillance cameras observed a suspect who removed a computer from a lobby display at the Pertusati University Bookstore and exited without paying for it. When the officers attempted to detain him, the suspect dropped the computer and fled on foot. He was located and detained by DPS officers, who responded to the incident and was transported to the 77th Station for booking.
At 2:10 p.m. on Nov. 17, a student at the Alpha Phi sorority reported her bike missing.
At 3:31 p.m. on Nov. 17, a student reported his bike missing at Annenberg House apartments.
At 5:24 p.m. on Nov. 17, two students reported that two suspects removed their cell phones which were placed on the table where they were sitting in Ronald Tutor Campus Center and fled on foot. DPS officers responded and located and detained the suspects based on descriptions given by the students and two witnesses at the scene. One of the suspects was found in possession of one of the stolen phones and, after being positively identified by the students, was transported to MDC for booking. The students were unable to identify the second suspect, and he was released.
Miscellaneous incidents

The Price School of Public Policy’s Women Leading Policy, Planning and Development along with the School of Social Work Diversity Committee and the Institute for Global Health held a screening of Honor Diaries, a documentary about the need to end honor violence, forced and underage marriage and female genital mutilation, in the Montgomery Ross Fisher building on Tuesday to promote awareness of these issues.
Professor Rafael Angulo of the School of Social Work kicked off the event by speaking about his connection to the film.
“As social workers, one of the things we are taught is to look at issues contextually,” Angulo said. “We constantly come across this issue of culture, and while we are meant to respect it, we are also meant to assess it and examine it from multiple perspectives.”
This critical examination of culture was the goal for the writer and producer of Honor Diaries, Paula Kweskin, who was present at the event.
“This film is about culture and the precepts it comes with,” Kweskin said. “One of my goals in this film is to create a discussion about these human rights violations and to bring these to action.”
The film depicts a salon-style setting with nine different women who have been working on Muslim women’s rights and come together to discuss these issues.
Honor Diaries is divided into sections, each dealing with honor violence, or violence against women in the name of a family’s honor; forced and underage marriage; and female genital mutilation, including the complete or partial removal of a clitoris to subdue female sexuality.
The documentary sheds light on the widespread violence. According to the film, nine out of 10 countries with the worst gender disparity are Muslim majority nations, more than 60 million women who are now 20 to 24 years old were married when they were minors, and at least 125 million women and girls have been mutilated in Africa and the Middle East since 1989.
One activist distinguished female from male genital mutilation.
“It cannot be compared to male circumcision,” said Ayaan Hirsi Ali, an activist, writer and politician. “It is very different.”
The women in the film discussed what makes it unique.
“It definitely is linked to honor because the gain is control of female sexuality,” an activist said.
Raheel Raza, president of the Council for Muslims Facing Tomorrow, discussed how women are a part of the problem.
“Why do we think patriarchy is never questioned? Because women are the main maintainers,” Raza said.
One such example in the movie was a midwife’s perception of the societal benefits associated with female genital mutilation. She said that girls who undergo such procedures are “purified,” and grow taller and marry better husbands, views  shared by those who advocate female genital mutilation.
The film also focused on the lifelong domination of Muslim women. Raza explained that throughout their lives, women are controlled by their fathers, then by their brothers, then by their husbands and sons.
At the conclusion of the film, Kweskin, Raza and Jasvinder Sanghera, founder and chief executive of Karma Nirvana, a U.K.-based nationwide helpline supporting victims of forced marriages and honor violence, joined Angulo for a panel discussion.
Sanghera spoke about her experience working on the documentary.
“I ran away from home when I was 16 years old, and the journey personally has been lonely,” Sanghera said. “But the salon setting reduced my isolation as an individual and a campaigner. It was extremely empowering.”
Students said they felt impacted by the film’s message.
“It has been really inspiring to hear how these women came together,” said Grace Hwang, a graduate student studying social work. “To come together to strengthen their own cause and further their movement has been empowering to see.”
Kweskin emphasized the potential influence of students in helping to end human rights violations.
“It is time for the United States to get on board and we definitely need universities to help that,” Kweskin said. “If USC would be interested in partnering us, we would be beyond thrilled to start that and push for this to get the recognition it deserves.”

Former USC student Kalman Levine, 55, was one of three American rabbis killed in an attack on the Kehilat Bnei Torah synagogue in West Jerusalem on Tuesday.
In remembrance · Mourners remember the lives of the victims who were killed during an attack on a synagogue in West Jerusalem Tuesday. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Armed with a gun, butcher knives and axes, two Palestinian men stormed the synagogue, located in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhood, during morning prayer services. After killing four and wounding several others, the attackers were killed at the scene in a shootout with police that fatally wounded one officer who died of his injuries on Tuesday evening.
Originally from Kansas City, Missouri, Levine enrolled in a pre-dental program at USC in the 1970s following his graduation from Hyman Brand Hebrew Academy in Kansas City, according to the Jewish Journal. He later dropped out of USC to pursue rabbinical study. Levine is survived by his wife and 10 children, according to Jewish Journal.
The USC chapter of J Street U, a student-run political organization advocating for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, released a statement on its Facebook page in response to the gruesome attacks.
“Despite today’s loss, we as both students and Trojans renew our efforts to be a voice for justice and peace for both Israelis and Palestinians,” the post stated. “Now more than ever, we call on all responsible leaders vested in a peaceful future for both peoples to work to calm tensions and avoid calls for revenge and similar actions that only further escalate an already toxic and untenable situation.”
The Jewish community at USC honored the victims’ lives during a vigil hosted at the Chabad house on Tuesday evening.
“It’s in our own personal ability to respond,” Rabbi Dov Wagner said at the vigil. “This is what shows that we do not allow evil to control what we see is important in the world. But rather, we ensure that we are focused. We are responding in the best way possible by adding means to the world.”

USC Swipes for the Homeless, an annual event which donates students’ extra dining dollars to people in need, will return this year from Dec. 1-5. The national organization won $30,000 in prize money from a social innovation pitch competition.
“At the end of each semester, we get people to donate their unused dining accounts, which is their remaining balances once winter break starts,” said Lauren O’Neil, co-president of USC Swipes for the Homeless.
USC Swipes for the Homeless typically stations members outside Trojan Grounds, the bookstore, and other prominent campus locations to encourage students to donate leftover dining dollars at the end of the semester.
The money is then converted by USC Hospitality into canned food, which is then donated to the Los Angeles mission.
Unlike last year, this year USC Swipes for the Homeless will also be on Tapingo, a smartphone application that allows students to order food for takeout or delivery.
“Students can sign up to donate their unused balances on the Tapingo app,” O’Neil said.
This was the first time that Swipes for the Homeless participated in the Social Venture Partners’ national fast pitch competition, and the organization was awarded three out of the six awards, amounting to a total of $30,000. O’Neil said hundreds of charities applied.
The three awards that the organization was given were the Judges Grand Prize Award, The Annenberg Audience Award and the Media Prize.
“One of them was the Audience Award, where the audience [was] able to vote for their favorite pitch,” said Rachel Sumekh, national executive director of Swipes for the Homeless. “The Grand Prize was given to us by a panel of judges, which amounted to $15,000.”
The company Ad-Prose also gave USC Swipes for the Homeless a donation of $5,000.
Sumekh was the youngest person presenting at the event, and Swipes for the Homeless was the newest organization.
According to the organization’s website, USC Swipes for the Homeless was created in spring of 2012 to assist with the issue of homelessness in the L.A. area.
“The last two weeks of every semester, we collect donations for Swipes for the Homeless,” O’Neil said. “It has been our basic model to get unused dining dollars at the end of each semester when accounts are frozen and students can no longer access them.”
The organization applied to the competition in July. Twenty semifinalists were chosen based on their applications. The list was then narrowed down to 10 finalists through presentations of their fast pitches to a panel of judges.
“The 10 finalists also go through a two-month training program on how to make speeches and how to make proposals,” O’Neil said.
USC Swipes for the Homeless was one of the 10 finalists chosen to present their three-minute fast pitch at the event, which was held at the Skirball Cultural Center on Oct. 29.
“It’s a networking event that connects innovators, sponsors, different philanthropic initiatives,” O’Neil said.
O’Neil and Sumekh attended the event as representatives for USC Swipes for the Homeless.
“The national director is going to use the prize money to create a national e-board,” O’Neil said. The national e-board will support the local chapters of Swipes for the Homeless and implement other awareness programs.
Originally, Sumekh was working out of a Starbucks, so this money will allow her to have an office. Hopefully, this will help her “to create the organizational structure to make Swipes for the Homeless stronger in a national sense,” O’Neil said.
The organization also plans to use the money to fund possible volunteer trips and support other local chapters of Swipes for the Homeless.

The Speak SC meeting at Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Tuesday night emphasized the role of students in maintaining a secure campus. Panelists from the Dept. of Public Safety and USC Transportation answered questions at the town hall-style meeting and encouraged a greater concern for safety at USC.
Safety first · USC and Department of Public Safety officials discussed the impact of their newly developed smartphone app, LiveSafe, on Tuesday. – Zhiliang Zhao | Daily Trojan
 
DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle told those in attendance that campus safety is a shared responsibility.
“The most important key to your safety is the same as it would be anywhere … smart decision making,” Carlisle said.
Student compliance is crucial for the success of DPS’s latest initiative, the USC Trojan Mobile Safety App, powered by LiveSafe Inc. LiveSafe is a smartphone app designed to improve incident reporting. Once installed on a student’s phone, LiveSafe functions in a similar way to blue light emergency systems around campus. By pressing a button, DPS can locate a student via GPS and respond without the student having to make a phone call.
Panelists paused the presentation so that attendees could download the app to their smartphone. Volunteers handed out fliers at the doorway and encouraged students to spread the word.
DPS has been promoting LiveSafe heavily on campus this week in order to meet President C.L. Max Nikias’ goal of 100 percent student participation in the program. As of Monday night, however, there have been only 1,200 downloads on both the University Park and Health Sciences campuses.
“It’s still a drop in the bucket,” Carlisle said.
DPS’s emphasis on safety segued into USC Transportation Director Tony Mazza’s presentation on the Campus Cruiser program.
“Part of safety at ’SC is a safe ride program,” Mazza said.
Mazza reported that Campus Cruiser can answer up to 1,400 calls per night on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, far exceeding comparable programs at universities such as the University of California, Berkeley.
USC Transportation is considering partnering with the San Francisco-based ridesharing service Uber to improve the program. Mazza, however, said he prefers a “closed system,” where cars are university-owned and students are the drivers.
“There’s camaraderie when a student gets in a car with another student in a car that’s owned by the university,” Mazza said.
Mazza said, though, that future collaboration with an Uber-like service is not out of the question.
Collaboration was also an important theme when discussing bike safety. Numerous thefts and collisions have led USC to considering additional bike lanes on Jefferson Boulevard and more secure bike parking.
DPS stressed the role students have in promoting transportation safety by complying with the rules regarding bike lanes and no-walk zones.
“We can only be so effective when it comes to enforcing bike policy. It’s not like we’re going to chase down a student and handcuff them,” DPS Chief John Thomas said.

Rivalry week between USC and UCLA has begun, and the Trojan Knights have gathered in full force around Tommy Trojan to begin their annual weeklong all-night vigil that will culminate in Save Tommy Night, a student rally in McCarthy Quad on Friday night. Members of Facilities Management Services were seen duct-taping the Tommy Trojan and Traveler statues in Hahn Plaza prior to the Trojans’ football game against the University of California, Berkeley last Thursday, when it was reported that the bear statue on UCLA’s campus had been vandalized.

In addition to the duct-taping of the two statues, a statue of George Tirebiter, USC’s unofficial canine mascot, has been put in its protective doghouse to protect against vandalism by UCLA fans.
On Sunday, a stuffed bear was hung from Tommy Trojan’s sword to kick off Troy Week, an annual week of school spirit activities preceding the football game with crosstown rival UCLA.
The Trojan Knights are a spirit and service organization with particular focus on traditions unique to USC. It is the oldest men’s service organization on campus.
“We focus on three things: brotherhood, philanthropy and spirit,” said Daniel Clancy,  president of the Knights.
The tradition of guarding Tommy Trojan has existed since the 1930s, when the statue was painted for the first time. The Knights refer to this tradition as Tommy Watch.
“My favorite thing about Tommy Watch is the amount of school spirit that kind of bubbles from all of us being here together,” said Konrad Mueller, philanthropy director of the Trojan Knights. “You see the university really come together: random people run by yelling, ‘Fight on,’ you have people walking their dogs in the morning, stopping to talk to us about a game they went to in 1978.”
This is Mueller’s third year participating in Tommy Watch. He said he was doing his best to deal with cooler temperatures this week.
“I’m from Chicago originally, so I have a little bit of that in my blood already, but that being said, I’m freezing my a– off,” he said.
According to Will Orr, the communications director of the Trojan Knights, the material for Tommy’s sword was changed to wood in 1946 after it was broken during a prank and could not be re-welded.
“We’ll be out here all week spending the night, people just spend as much time out here as they can,” Clancy said. If USC wins the football game, the Trojan Knights will be responsible for taking care of the Victory Bell, a 295-pound bell that is awarded to the victor of the annual USC-UCLA football game since 1942.
“We also do our best to keep an eye on Traveler and sort of patrol the different statues on campus,” said Peter Lockwood, athletics director of the Trojan Knights.
The Knights were founded in 1921, and the Tommy Trojan statue was unveiled during USC’s 50th Jubilee in 1930.
“I think us just hanging out around the statue is going to deter anyone from coming up, and it’s taped as well, so [guarding the statue] is much more just one of the traditions we maintain at USC,” Clancy said.
There has been a long history of pranks between USC and UCLA. Most recently, USC fans painted “SC runs LA” on the Bruin statue at UCLA. The school was caught off-guard because the vandalism was done before Rivalry Week had begun.
UCLA has since put the statue in a protective box to protect it from further damage.
“Every once in a while they’ll dump soap into one of our fountains and make it foam up, but that’s sort of a terrible prank,” Lockwood said.
So far there have been no known vandalism attempts by UCLA this year.
“Ever since the security on campus has been upped and they don’t let people in past nine o’clock, there have been a lot less actual threats, but we still keep an eye out,” Lockwood said.

Fall can be one of the most romantic times of the year. Thanksgiving break is the perfect time to ask that special someone out on a date — students don’t have school, athletes don’t have practice and the homework we were assigned can definitely wait until the night before class to start on. The opportunities for dates are plentiful. You could take that person out on a variety of fall-themed dates: roaming through pumpkin patches, picking for apples on a farm and sharing hot chocolate and warm apple cider in one of Los Angeles’ many parks.  Though those ideas are fun and sweet, however, they don’t show too much thought. Personally, when I go on a date, I want to know the guy has shown at least some consideration for my interests.
Though most people go home for Thanksgiving break, some don’t, and if you happen to be around the L.A. area, there are so many festive dates you can go on.

Like many little girls, 8-year-old Ren Martinez knew exactly what she wanted to be when she grew up: a singer.
Now a senior majoring in popular music performance at the Thornton School of Music, Martinez, a native of Malibu, is watching her childhood dream become a reality. Her original single “Dial Tone” was featured in this week’s episode of Fox’s New Girl.
Making connections · Ren Martinez had the opportunity to have her song “Dial Tone” featured on an episode of New Girl through a friend. After graduating from USC this spring, she intends to pursue music and acting. – Photo courtesy of Ren Martinez
 
Though the song is only played briefly in the background of one scene, simply having her music on television was a milestone for Martinez and her budding career.
“[Having my music on the show] is still super exciting and surreal,” Martinez said. “I didn’t believe it was happening until I saw it.”
Martinez said her younger self would be proud of her music’s appearance on a television show, especially a show that draws millions of viewers each week.
“I’ve been singing pretty much since I could talk. I started writing songs, not very good ones, at around 8 years old,” Martinez said.
Coupling her passion with ambition, Martinez realized at a young age that becoming an accomplished musician requires more than just wishful thinking. She devoted seven years of her childhood to singing in a choir and carried that dedication with her into college.
After performing background vocals on several friends’ recordings, Martinez recorded her first two singles in June, utilizing newfound skils from an arranging class she took at Thornton. She considers hearing the final product one of her proudest moments.
“Finally getting to hear the arrangements through speakers the same way I had heard them in my head just made me feel incredibly grateful and definitely proud,” Martinez said.
Martinez’s recordings, including “Dial Tone,” are available through her Soundcloud account, “renmartinezmusic.” Currently, she’s working on a five-song EP, which will be available in the spring.
A self-described “folky girl,” Martinez’s musical inspirations span several decades, from ’60s folk to ’90s pop. Her musical role models range from Jackson Browne and Sky Ferreira to Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys. This variety of influences is reflected by her unique sound, which is best described as a mashup of traditional folk music, with modern indie pop and electronic sounds.
When she’s not writing and recording songs, Martinez promotes her music through live performances, most recently at the Silverlake Lounge on Nov. 15. Other recent shows have included performances at locations including The Talking Stick and the Villain’s Tavern, yet Martinez still considers Tommy’s Place at USC one of her favorite venues to perform at.
“I love performing at Tommy’s Place because it’s really easy for a bunch of people to come out and support,” Martinez said.
Martinez’s second passion after musical performance is theatrical performance. She’s participated in two shows with USC’s student-run Brand New Theatre organization and noted that though both musical and theatrical shows involve performing live in front of an audience, there are significant differences between the two.
“Theater is really different because the words that you’re saying aren’t words that you wrote, but I’ve been really lucky to be a part of some very well-written and well-directed productions,” Martinez said.
Between her songwriting, acting and singing, it’s clear that Martinez’s success stems from her hard work and natural talent. But, she attributes many of her accomplishments to collaborations with others.
“I’ve learned that if you’re willing to open yourself to people, that’s when the best opportunities come your way,” Martinez said. “People can open doors for you, but it’s up to you to walk through them.”
Martinez has experienced this firsthand, from her first recording opportunities singing background vocals for friends, to the New Girl opportunity, which came from a close acquaintance. In addition to her solo work, Martinez provides background vocals for folk pop band Ghost in the Canyon. She met the band’s lead singer, Catherine Rose Smith, through USC’s popular music  program, which Smith graduated from last year.
After her own graduation in the spring, Martinez hopes to pursue both music and acting. When asked what advice she’d give to younger aspiring musicians, Martinez offered wisdom that can be applied regardless of their career.
“Everyone is their own worst critic, and that’s I’ve learned to trust myself to work hard and produce good work, instead of getting too wrapped up in not making mistakes,” she said.

Bertrand Bonello’s biopic Saint Laurent is a deliberately hot mess, simultaneously precise and excessive, much like its subject, Yves Saint Laurent, himself. Bonello has directed and co-written a curious film that slithers under viewers skin and stays there even as they exit the theater. Hopscotching through the ’60s and ’70s, the height of Saint Laurent’s career, Bonello dares the audience to judge Saint Laurent’s excesses.
Spitting image · Gaspard Ulliel disappears into the role of Yves Saint Laurent, expertly capturing the iconic designer’s quirks and eccentricities. His performace ties in with the film’s exacting attention to detail. – Photo courtesy of Mandarin Films
As Bonello intended, in the film Yves Saint Laurent (Gaspard Ulliel) remains a mythical fashion icon. Even after 150 minutes, Saint Laurent is still an enigma. Surrounded by his coterie of muses — the striking Betty Catroux (Aymeline Valade), whom he sees literally sees as a reflection of himself, and Loulou de la Falaise (Léa Seydoux), the original bohemian vintage goddess — Saint Laurent uses others as a shield. The man is interesting, but unsympathetic. He is so removed that it is difficult to care about him. Part of Saint Laurent’s alienation from the audience is justified because it mirrors the disintegration of his own relationships. It is easy to see why, in 1989, the aged Saint Laurent (Helmut Berger), eerily still voiced by Ulliel, sits alone in his apartment.
The man and the myth are inseparable. Ulliel’s performance is inspired in the way that he catches onto the performative aspects of being Yves Saint Laurent. Yves is simultaneously playful and cruel, guarded and vulnerable, and Ulliel constructs these contradictory traits through an extra-slim physique, a reedy voice and an analytical and intelligent performance. Catching glances of himself in the omnipresent mirrors in the film, Ulliel’s Yves Saint Laurent is just as much a designer of himself as he was of women’s clothing. Part of the realism is helped by the fact that Ulliel drew the actual drawings that appear in the film.
The Viscontian influence on Bonello comes through in the themes of nostalgia, change and stagnation. Bonello’s original score is a lush mix of Callas, Creedence Clearwater Revival and others. It is again about being stuck in the past and the present. Saint Laurent has such a fear of stagnation, but he is obsessed with Proust, emotionally attached to the recreation of past worlds like the ’40s inspired Liberation collection and Ballet Russes, and insecure about the ephemeral nature of fashion. He surrounds himself with a world of Grecian busts and buddhas and Matisse paintings. Bonello takes care to use film techniques to evoke Saint Laurent’s favored Mondrian in the geometric screen divisions. A montage of YSL collections split-screened with real world events, is an inelegant but accurate metaphor to express the simultaneous change and inertia of these people.
The film zooms in on his affair with the deliciously hedonistic and infantile Jacques de Bascher (Louis Garrel). The relationship is obviously dangerous from the moment the pair’s eyes lock across a club under a rainbow of neon lights, separated by frenetically pulsing bodies in various stages of intoxication. At the same time, Saint Laurent is bound by his strained relationship with his business partner and longtime-lover Pierre Bergé (Jérémie Renier). Renier portrays just the right amount of control and love in a quasi-heroic and chaotic six-minute business negotiation scene involving American investors and a simultaneous interpreter. He is sympathetic because it is clear how much Yves Saint Laurent, the brand and the man, need him.
There is, also the matter of that other Yves Saint Laurent film — the one, by Jalil Lespert, endorsed by YSL. It’s fitting that the film is titled Saint Laurent, because the film is also a love letter the people working behind the scenes. In the Saint Laurent atelier, headed by the formidable but warm Anne Marie Munoz (Amira Casar), dozens of seamstresses take measurements, cut, sew and drape. Munoz leads a team of seamstresses dressed in white coats as they cooly analyze every wrinkle. The textures and colors of the clothing and period are at their best the on 35mm film. Costume designer Anaïs Romand’s work is amazing and even more impressive considering the lack of assistance from the brand’s archives. Part of the credit goes to historic consultant Olivier Châtenet, who pulled from his own collection of vintage Saint Laurent.
The sterile atelier is a world apart from the passions that consume Saint Laurent and come out in his work. The atelier in itself is part of a gorgeous set design by production designer Katia Wyszkop, created in a Parisian townhouse that included Saint Laurent’s multiple residences and places in the film. The atelier in the film was also the costume construction shop for the film. The production hired seamstresses both to make the costumes and to act. It is only with their hard work that Yves’ Ballet Russes collection of 1976, which he says in the film is his proudest achievement, is able to come to life.

After an up-and-down first two games, the USC men’s basketball team will head east for the Charleston Classic. The Trojans will enter the tournament with a 1-1 record after a strong team win against Tennessee Tech on Monday night that saw the Trojans lead from start to finish.

Despite a rough start to the season, the Trojans have a strong shot at making a deep run in the tournament. The Charleston Classic features a total of eight teams: Akron, Charlotte, Cornell, Drexel, Miami, Penn State, Southern Carolina and USC, all of which are unranked.
As shown through the first two games, USC will rely on their highly touted freshman class, led by point guard Jordan McLaughlin. The first-year guard has been off to quite an impressive start, averaging 17 points and 6.5 assists, albeit with nine turnovers, through the first two games. Redshirt sophomore guard Katin Reinhardt has also played spectacularly for the Trojans in his first two games since transferring from UNLV. Reinhardt, who sat out last season due to NCAA rules, currently averages 15 points, 3.5 rebounds and two assists as he and McLaughlin have created a great one-two punch for the Trojan backcourt. Reinhardt hopes that the momentum will carry over as the team heads on the road for the first time.
“Any time you open a college season with a loss it’s tough,” Reinhardt said. “We should’ve won that game. We knew what we had to do and for us, especially going [on the road next], it was big to get this.”
But if the Trojans hope to make an impression, they need second-year big man Nikola Jovanovic to step his play up. The forward had an inspiring offseason as he led the Pac-12 All-Stars in scoring, but his play has yet to translate over to USC’s offense. Jovanovic struggled for his second straight game Monday night and is averaging a mere 6.5 points and five rebounds on 25 percent shooting.
“I was the most surprised guy in the city of Los Angeles when he played like he did on Saturday,” head coach Andy Enfield said afterward of his returning leading scorer.
Another aspect the Trojans must focus on is taking care of the ball. The team is averaging 20 turnovers per game, while only contributing 11 assists. Though the team improved drastically in their second game, they must clean up the turnovers if they want to compete every night. Enfield understands the importance of protecting the ball.
“Normally you can’t win when you turn it over 17 times,” Enfield said, “But we trimmed them down in the second half and I thought our guys played with confidence down the stretch. It was nice. We needed a win here.”
The Trojans will kick off the tournament against the Akron Zips (1-0), who are coming off a 17-point win over the University of Maryland, Baltimore Country. Akron entered the year with high expectations after winning the MAC Championship and earning a NCAA bid last season. But the Zips will be without who is arguably their best player, Demetrius Treadwell, who has been suspended indefinitely by the university for violating the school’s student-athlete code of conduct. Treadwell was a preseason All-MAC selection as he led Akron with 15.2 points and 8.6 rebounds last season.
Akron returns three starters from last season’s MAC championship squad and features a multitude of upperclassmen ready to contribute. To make up for Treadwell’s absence, the Zips will look to spread the ball around, as they had 10 players score in their first game.
The Trojans will have to focus on defense, especially protecting the three-point line as the Zips attempted 30 three pointers against UMBC. But Akron lacks real size or depth at the center position, so the Trojans should make sure to attack the paint and crash the boards for easy second-chance points.
Should the Trojans defeat Akron on Thursday, they would play either Drexel or Miami the next night.

It has absolutely nothing to do with the inaugural College Football Playoff. The last time either team claimed a national championship, Calvin Coolidge was president. It’s supposedly a rivalry game, but the favorite has won the last seven matchups and has home field advantage. The game won’t be broadcast on ESPN or any of the national networks but rather on a network-affiliated channel only available with certain cable packages. I could not name a single player on either team’s roster.
No game · Last year, Lee Corso picked USC to beat Stanford during ESPN’s College GameDay program. GameDay hasn’t visited a Pac-12 matchup this entire season and will head to Harvard this weekend. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
And yet, I’d argue the most interesting college football game this weekend is the one steeped in so much tradition that the game is known simply across college football as The Game.
Harvard vs. Yale.
Though Michigan and Ohio State might claim a trademark on the nickname “The Game,” the Harvard-Yale game truly is one of the classic rivalries in football. The programs, both founded in the 1870s, are two of the oldest in the entire sport, and Saturday will mark the 131st meeting between the two — Yale holds a 65-57-8 series lead. Though the last win was in 1927, during Coolidge’s second term, they’ve claimed 34 national championships, with Yale claiming 27 and Harvard claiming seven.
I was a little surprised to see ESPN announce that it would film this week’s edition of College GameDay on campus at Harvard. In fact, I was hopeful the set of the college football prediction show would come to Pasadena this weekend for the USC-UCLA game so I could spend my Saturday morning trying to get on TV. But the move by ESPN actually makes a lot sense, and it will provide a glimpse into a side of college football that honestly doesn’t make as much sense — or should I say cents? — compared to the football I’m used to watching.
For how exciting the season has been, this weekend actually looks like it will be relatively quiet in Division I-FBS college football, at least on paper. The Saturday slate features only two matchups between two ranked teams in the AP Poll — No. 24 USC at No. 11 UCLA and No. 15 Arizona at No. 20 Utah — and those four teams aren’t really in the discussion for a spot in the playoff. All the teams that are could hypothetically lose to their unranked opponent, but most of them play at home, so an upset wouldn’t even elicit the field storming of the week. With no games jumping out as guaranteed heavyweight barnburners or particularly probable upset chances, it makes sense for ESPN to go for a more unusual setting for College GameDay.
This year’s edition of The Game will also be particularly exciting as it will be crucial for the Ivy League championship. Harvard leads the conference with a 6-0 record to go along with a 9-0 overall record, but Yale, 8-1 overall and 5-1 in conference, could claim a share of the title with a win.
But what I’m most interested to see is the atmosphere of an Ivy League game, and really just any Division I-FCS game. It’s fascinating to me how little revenue programs make in that division, and yet schools still pledge the resources to field those teams.
The Ivy League doesn’t have its own TV network. When the Ivy League most recently renewed a two-year deal with NBC Sports Network, the deal required NBC to broadcast a minimum of six but no more than 10 football games a year on the network’s cable affiliate channel, not the actual national network. The league did not disclose the deal’s value. The Pac-12, on the other hand, does have its own network, and projected that each school in the conference would make $25 to $30 million per year from the conference’s media rights deal with national networks like ESPN and Fox.
Now, a school like Harvard certainly doesn’t have a shortage of money. Bloomberg recently reported that the school’s endowment is $36.4 billion. I can’t even comprehend what that means, and adding an extra $30 million from a TV deal would be less than a 0.1 percent increase in that fund.
It’s interesting to note, however, that Ivy League schools don’t give any athletic scholarships; only academic scholarships are given to those who qualify for financial aid. The NCAA Division I-FBS football model gets a lot of criticism for exploiting athletes by only compensating football players in scholarships, and this is a topic worth its own column. But the system gives 85 student athletes — insert NCAA sanctions joke and excuse for any performance shortcomings due to depth here — from 128 schools competing in Division I-FBS football full-ride scholarships to four-year universities. That’s an opportunity for over 10,000 football players in any given year to study at an elite academic institution for free, an opportunity many of them would not be able to afford without the scholarship.
The other common misconception among NCAA critics is that the revenue made from the mega TV deals all ends up in the pockets of university administrators and NCAA organizers. Not just the NCAA, but every school in the NCAA, is a nonprofit institution. It’s important to distinguish that this revenue is not profit because the revenue goes towards funding non-revenue sports in universities and providing other student athletes with the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to play college sports.
Now, of course, the money invested into a Division I-FBS football program only becomes revenue if the team wins often enough to sell tickets and get people to watch on TV. It’s a business decision with different answers for different universities. I have no idea what Prairie View A&M’s athletic budget looks like, but my guess is that the Panthers are doing just fine in Division I-FCS and that their athletic director would be delusional to think they run with the big boys. Harvard would, of course, have to find a conference to compete in — the ACC would make the most geographic sense — and that would be the biggest hurdle. But if Harvard wanted to be good at football, my guess is it would find a way to be good at football. Stanford provides a great model. Whether or not that would be worth the investment and change in image is an existential crisis regarding the value of college sports and college as a whole that I cannot answer for Harvard — I didn’t even bother applying there. But it’s something I find really interesting, and I hope ESPN discusses the possibility on Saturday.
I have high expectations for some hilariously witty signs and posters from students on set at Harvard during the GameDay filming. My perception of the student body at Harvard is still marred somewhat by The Social Network, but I’ve developed a much softer spot for the school since my older brother Chris was accepted there. I hope Lee Corso picks the Crimson to win, not because I’m invested in the result at all, but because the Crimson isn’t a real mascot and I’d be curious to see how Corso goes about wearing this nonexistent mascot on his head. And as I joked with Chris, I hope one team records a sack of the other team’s quarterback in the endzone so we can finally determine which of the two universities is really a “safety” school.
I don’t mean to undermine the significance of the USC-UCLA game. Somehow, the Trojans can still win the Pac-12 with a victory over the Bruins and one Arizona State loss. But the best is yet to come from that rivalry, and I look forward to when College GameDay comes to town the next time both of those teams are legitimately fighting for a playoff spot.
For this week, it’s all about the Ivies in college football. The matchup might feel as relevant as the Calvin Coolidge administration — did he do anything as president? — but it’s worthwhile for a sport that has changed so much in the last decade and will change even more in years to come to take a look at its old-school roots.

The USC football team was back on the practice field on Tuesday morning, just four days before a crosstown showdown with archrival UCLA. Saturday’s game carries serious Pac-12 implications, as both the No. 11 Bruins (8-2, 5-2 Pac-12) and the No. 24 Trojans (7-3, 6-2) still have a chance to capture the conference’s South division. For the third consecutive year, the two rivals are each ranked in the AP Top 25. Unfortunately, in what has been a recurring theme at USC this season, off-the-field issues have begun to dominate the week’s headlines.
Get it Shawty · Senior cornerback Josh Shaw, who was suspended from all team activities after admitting that he lied to the school about spraining his ankles while saving his nephew, was reinstated on Tuesday. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
The Shaw goes on
USC officially reinstated senior cornerback Josh Shaw on Tuesday afternoon, per a press release from the school’s sports information department. Shaw sustained two high ankle sprains a week before USC’s season opener against Fresno State but was suspended from the team indefinitely after it was revealed that he had lied about jumping from a second-floor balcony to save his drowning nephew.
The Palmdale, California, native issued an explanation of his injuries last week, telling Bill Plaschke of the Los Angeles Times that he leapt from his third-floor balcony after police responded to a domestic dispute involving Shaw and his girlfriend. Shaw maintained that he never used physical violence, a claim that was seemingly confirmed when the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office declined to press charges. This development was a crucial part of the school’s decision to lift Shaw’s suspension.
“For several months, local authorities have been investigating the August 23 incident involving Josh Shaw,” Athletic Director Pat Haden said in his statement. “They have now concluded that investigation and determined that no action will be taken against him.”
Haden also revealed that an internal investigation cleared Shaw of any wrongdoing.
“USC also conducted its own internal investigation of Josh [Shaw], evaluating both Athletic Department code of conduct and potential NCAA compliance issues,” Haden said. “Based on these investigations and their conclusions, and the 10-game suspension Josh has served for code of conduct violations, we have made the decision to reinstate him.”
Shaw, who was voted a team captain before the season began, was projected to anchor the Trojans’ young secondary going into the season. His role going forward is unclear, though he will practice and attend team meetings.
“I’ve welcomed Josh Shaw back to the team,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said. “I’m now in the process of evaluating how Josh can contribute to the team’s success.”
Buck the trend
After a 50-0 beatdown of the Bruins in 2011, USC has fallen to UCLA in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1997-1998. The series has been a back-and-forth struggle since 1990, with the Trojans winning 13 of 24 matchups. Sarkisian, who went 6-1 against the Bruins in two stints as an assistant coach, has been impressed by the quality of both teams over the rivalry’s history.
“That’s what makes rivalries great,” Sarkisian said. “If [both teams don’t win] it wouldn’t really be a rivalry. But I try not to focus on historical trends or patterns or anything like that.”
One difference between this year’s Trojans and the team that fell to UCLA at home last season is the continued development of redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler, who received praise from his head coach on Tuesday morning.
“[Kessler]’s been extremely efficient,” Sarkisian said. “He’s throwing the ball on time to the right people with accuracy. The end result is that he’s got really good numbers.”
USC’s ground game, led by redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen, has also put up stellar numbers this season. The unit struggled in last Thursday’s 38-30 win over Cal, however, leading Sarkisian to implement some changes.
“I think our patience needs to be better to allow our blocking schemes to occur,” Sarkisian said. “I also feel like Buck [Allen] has gotten a little bit high, almost searching for the run, rather than allowing it to happen. So that’s been a point of emphasis for us.”
Quick hits
Shaw is no longer a team captain, so the block “C” will be removed from his jersey for the team’s remaining games.
Freshman tight end Bryce Dixon returned to practice this week, but has not yet been cleared to play. Dixon missed last Thursday’s game against Cal after a non-academic, conduct-related incident involving another student.
Freshman safety John Plattenburg, who missed the Cal game with a thigh injury, was not limited at Tuesday’s practice.
Senior linebacker J.R. Tavai took reps on Tuesday. Tavai, who injured his knee against Utah, is expected to see his first game action in nearly a month against UCLA.
Finally, the Trojans made their debut in the newest College Football Playoff rankings at No. 19. The Bruins rose to No. 9.

Across California, Asian American and Pacific Islander students comprise 11 percent of the K-12 student population. In Santa Clara County, where I taught fourth grade, that number is nearly three times as high. But though these students make up a significant portion of the children in our schools, when it comes to the conversation around expanding educational opportunity for underserved kids, their voices and faces are glaringly absent.
Much of that gap stems from stereotypes that drive misperceptions of our AAPI community. You’ve heard them before: “Asian kids are good at math,” “All Asians go to college” and “Asian families have school figured out.”
The reality is that the AAPI community is diverse, consisting of more than 48 ethnicities, more than 300 spoken languages, varied socioeconomic status and distinctions across immigration history, generational status, culture and religion. The myth that Asians constitute a “model minority” obscures the nuances and distinctions of these subgroups. Most dangerous, however, is that this lumping together as a successful aggregate masks the needs and unique challenges of so many individuals. Like other communities of color and low-income communities, AAPI communities face very real barriers. According to the U.S. census, many subgroups — including Laotian, Samoan and Tongan — exhibit higher rates of poverty than the national average. The Cambodian, Hmong and Marshallese communities experience poverty at rates more than twice the national number.
In California, 40 percent of Cambodians and Laotians haven’t finished high school and more than 40 percent of Vietnamese, Koreans, Laotians, Hmong, Cambodians, Taiwanese and Chinese speak limited English.
So when we talk about ensuring all kids have access to a great education, creating culturally responsive academic supports, working with communities to help the next generation achieve personal and scholarly success, AAPI students deserve a place in the conversation.
To get there, we can start by strengthening the pipeline of AAPI education leaders. Nationwide, less than 2 percent of teachers identify as AAPI, leaving many of our AAPI students without role models who look like them and share their backgrounds. Though great teachers come from all backgrounds and identities, emerging data that tells us teachers who share the racial or ethnic backgrounds of their students have a profound additional impact.
As a kid, I had just two AAPI teachers from kindergarten to high school graduation. Most of my teachers knew little about my background or experiences, and I struggled to relate to them. It wasn’t until I took an Asian American studies course at the university level that I saw an alignment between my identity and my studies. I often wonder what might be different now if I had had more AAPI teachers who would have incorporated content relevant to my identity. When I entered the classroom as a Teach For America corps member, I was determined to leverage my experiences to help my students understand their own identities, strengths and potential to succeed.
My kids were at the top of my mind a couple weeks ago as I joined over 200 AAPI staff members at Teach For America’s second annual Asian American & Pacific Islander Staff Summit. As participants, we spent three days meeting with social justice leaders in the Los Angeles’ AAPI community. We explored how community organizations, teachers, parents and students can work together as community advocates for greater educational and economic opportunities for their students. Though there is much work to do, I felt empowered walking away from the summit with concrete steps to take. As AAPI leaders, we need to do more to get our kids’ needs on the agenda.
Any stereotype or assumption about a population is a problem — even when, like the “model minority” myth, the characterizations are seen as largely positive. Such stereotypes cause people to overlook or ignore urgent hurdles facing communities, and leave its members without the supports to help improve their circumstances. We can’t ignore our AAPI students. We owe them so much more.

Asian American and Pacific Islander students are a significant part of the population and school student bodies. OK, I get it. They need good schools, good teachers, caring parents, the opportunity to learn and to get help when their learning is impeded. Agreed. So what do you want governments and schools to do? Implement yet one more “affirmative action” program for them? Why not a special, unique “affirmative action program” for every student group identifiable by race, color, ethnicity or religion? Do you believe that to be a logical and reasonable way to improve education for all children? Wherever improvements in schooling are possible, government and schools should provide them to all students, not restricted to selected special, privileged, racial, color, ethnic or religion groups.

In  the ongoing battle against HIV, the media still labels the drug Truvada as controversial. Approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2012 for pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, against HIV infection, the pill has been shown to work effectively, but some  continue to stir up unnecessary and dangerous skepticism about the drug.
Linda Xu | Daily Trojan
The main culprit is Michael Weinstein, the president of the Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation. Starting this week, according to the The New York Times, Weinstein’s foundation will be putting out negative advertisements in gay-oriented newspapers around the nation. The ads are headlined, “What if you’re wrong about PrEP?” with the caveat that “the [Center for Disease Control’s] ill-advised strategy of mass treatment with Truvada poses a significant risk to the condom culture, which while it has eroded, has still prevailed among gay men for three decades.”
As Weinstein was quoted by USA Today in April, “If something comes along that’s better than condoms, I’m all for it, but Truvada is not that.” He added, “Let’s be honest: It’s a party drug.” While Weinstein doesn’t deny that Truvada can curb HIV transmission, what he objects to is an upsurge in PrEP use. The CDC now recommends PrEP for up to 500,000 Americans at risk of contracting HIV, which is a steep increase from the thousands of Americans on PrEP prescriptions presently, according to The New York Times.
Weinstein and the AHF argue that this kind of widespread PrEP use could be a poor decision because adherence to taking the drug has been low in clinical trials. When people don’t take it as often as they should, they become more vulnerable to infection, and there’s a possibility that the reliance on the drug as a prevention safeguard might discourage condom use and lead to higher HIV infection rates. This attitude could be a concern. As actor Zachary Quinto wrote in the Huffington Post last week, he’s “heard too many stories of young people taking PrEP as an insurance policy against their tendency toward unprotected non-monogamous sex.”
Though skepticism is healthy at times, a look at the benefits of PrEP through Truvada seems to clearly point at the drug’s ability to outweigh the risks cited. People might not take the pills or use condoms as often, but the efficacy of the drug will still help fight the contraction of HIV/AIDS. Weinstein’s concerns over the damage Truvada will inflict on the condom culture is unfounded because if that culture could actually stop the epidemic, it would have by now at least curbed a lot of infection cases. According to the CDC’s 2010 HIV  Surveillance Report, the number of diagnosed cases for HIV has remained stable from 2007 through 2010 in the United States, but that, more alarmingly, the numbers and rates continue to increase in subpopulations.
Since the first appearance of AIDS in the United States around 1969, the battle to stop the viral epidemic has been immense. Through trial and error, different treatments have been enacted, one of which involves azidothymidine (AZT), a drug marketed under the brand name Retrovir. The first U.S. government-approved treatment for HIV, AZT slows disease progression within the body by inhibiting with an enzyme called reverse transcriptase that helps HIV synthesize DNA for propagation. Prevention, though, is just as crucial. Casting doubts on whether or not people should use a drug that has so much potential to do good is dangerous because if those opinions spread and more people buy into the belief that Truvada is, as Weinstein has said, “a public health disaster in the making,” the risk of more people contracting HIV only gets higher. Such a mistake could limit the chances we have of eradicating the disease.
Not to mention how much data there is out there that shows Truvada’s revolutionary benefits. According to Science Translational Medicine, “intermittent prophylactic treatment with long-acting antiviral drugs would be as effective as daily dosing in blocking the earliest stages of viral replication and preventing mucosal transmission.” According to AIDS.gov, studies found that for those who took Truvada consistently, the risk of HIV infection was up to 92 percent lower compared to the control group.
With these results, it is necessary for people, especially those in powerful positions such as Quinto or Weinstein, to understand the overall positive effects that drugs like Truvada can have on society. Otherwise, their ignorance could lead to fatal decisions on the parts of those needing to take the drug. Outspoken activists like Weinstein should understand that activists for Truvada have never said anything about lowering HIV prevention methods, so to assume that will always be the case is wrong.
