Well, this was not part of the plan.
Before the season began, one could imagine what the Thursday before the Oregon game would be like: the campus buzzing with excitement, students posting pictures of the ESPN College GameDay crew setting up in front of the Coliseum and cardinal and gold scattered across campus in support of the national championship-bound Trojans.
Grounded · After entering the season as many polls’ No. 1 team, undisciplined play has derailed the Trojans’ hopes for a national title. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The reality of the situation is a bit underwhelming.
Yes, USC face-planted last Saturday in the hot Tucson sun, giving up possession of the ball on five occasions and giving up free yards in penalties too many times to count. Amid all the referees’ flag-throwing, you could just feel the Trojans’ fans back home throwing in the towel on what was supposed to be the perfect season.
As much as it pains me to admit it, for about an hour after the game, I was one of them.
I consider myself an optimistic person, and this attitude applies greatly to how I view my sports teams.
But after the game Saturday, I couldn’t help but look at USC’s remaining schedule and think of how grateful I would be if we could win just half of our remaining games.
But after seeing how other USC fans and students have reacted to the loss, my dedication to optimism was reaffirmed: We can’t fall apart now.
Let’s be clear, this season has been a huge disappointment.
The storybook ending that everyone was hoping for was torn to pieces after the Stanford loss. The scraps that remained after that were set on fire after the Arizona game, leaving behind ashes that only serve as a reminder of what could have been.
But this is exactly why we as a fan base and student body have to rush to the team’s aid.
Fans know what the nation expects to see on Saturday: They expect to see Oregon throttle USC in front of a two-thirds filled Coliseum.
Oregon has a knack for forcing mistakes, spelling huge trouble for this USC team, which has proven adept at shooting itself in the foot.
We can’t control how the team plays on Saturday; we can only hope it repeats last year’s performance in Eugene.
But what we can control is how we approach game day: We need to come and make life as difficult as we can for Oregon by making the Coliseum as loud as it’s ever been.
Just because we are at a lowly 6-2 (most teams would gladly take such a record) does not mean we are now allowed to abandon our team. Disappointing or not, they are still our guys, a part of the Trojan Family.
What sense would it make for us to jump ship when the going has now gotten tough?
After everything these players and coaches have been through, this season was supposed to be their payoff.
It still can be, even without a national championship game at the end.
And though there is no doubt that every member on that team was shooting for the stars this season, I think each one of them would agree that the chance to play for the Pac-12 championship is still a more than worthy pursuit.
In fact, after what most of these players have been through, just about any bowl game would seem like the Super Bowl at this point.
When the sanctions came down more than two years ago, everybody on USC’s roster had the opportunity to leave. The door was open for Matt Barkley and the rest to leave for greener pastures.
By now we all know that they chose to stay and finish what they started.
And though other matters of business may in fact be left unfinished, I guarantee that this team, with all of its flaws, will fight on ’til the end.
It’s our duty to fight right along with them.

Thanks for the much needed reminder that when the going gets tough, the tough don’t abandon ship. They “fight on”!!
Awesome article. The Trojan family will fight with them. TIME TO CARDINAL OUT THE COLI!
Fight on Nick.  Love it.

For the USC men’s basketball team, this week represents the calm before the storm.
Fierce competition · USC men’s basketball has several players vying for key reserve roles, including senior guard Greg Allen. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The Trojans are gearing up for the start of the regular season next Friday, Nov. 9, against Coppin State at the Galen Center. It has been only two and a half weeks since their first official practice of the semester on Oct. 12, but with the season just around the corner, USC coach Kevin O’Neill and his players have their chance to redeem last year’s dismal 6-26 record.
“We’re trying to take it practice by practice because we don’t want to look ahead,” O’Neill said. “I like what our guys have done in their approach in terms of playing hard every day. And that’s what they need to do to keep going and getting better.”
O’Neill is quick to lower the hype surrounding the ever-approaching 2012-13 campaign, pointing out that there’s still plenty of work to be done in the meantime.
“We’re eons away,” O’Neill said. “We’ve got so many new guys —  we’re a long ways away. But we’re headed in the right direction.”
Major questions that need to be answered before the opener remain; one such question involves junior transfer center Omar Oraby, who has yet to hear from the NCAA as to whether he will be eligible to play immediately with a hardship waiver. He was, however, back at practice alongside senior guard Jio Fontan after both sat out earlier last week because of injuries.
“Everything is good,” Fontan said. “When you’re doing three-hour days back-to-back-to-back, it’s kind of smart for my case to step out for a day. So everything is pretty good right now.”
The team’s three-hour practices are as intense as ever, which Fontan says is by design.
“It’s important right now to stay as aggressive as possible, because once the season starts you kind of want to slow down on how aggressive you are in practice with the constant games,” Fontan said. “So it’s important that this week and next week we really go at it. [O’Neill] has been doing a good job of putting us through a lot of contact stuff, and it’s working out.”
Most of the players are still adjusting to a new group of teammates and strategies, which might have spurred O’Neill’s comments about being “eons away” from where they eventually want to be.
“Everybody is learning still,” senior guard Greg Allen said. “They’re making easy mistakes that they’re not going to make later on in the season, but we’re just trying to learn it as fast as we can. The sooner the better, but everyone is trying.”
Tuesday’s practice, in particular, brought out some aggressive play from two of USC’s youngsters, freshman guards Brendyn Taylor and Chass Bryan.
“Both of them did a great job,” O’Neill said. “They’re both talented guys. They’re athletic. We want them to be aggressive, we want them to play like veterans.”
That seems to be the mantra of the whole team, however, not just the freshmen. With so many roster spots still up for grabs, the Trojans will likely continue to stay aggressive in the coming days.
“It’s just about competition,” Allen said. “Everybody is competing to see what their role is on the team to help out however they can.”

Point: Despite Oregon’s recent string of success and a better record in 2012, USC remains the premier program in the Pac-12.
This Saturday, Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota’s cannon of an arm — yes, it’s stronger than Matt Barkley’s — and the blur of all-purpose weapon De’Anthony Thomas’ legs will give Trojan defenders nightmares. Oh, and the Ducks’ Heisman Trophy candidate Kenjon Barner can also play a little as well.
There’s no question that No. 4 Oregon might traipse into the Coliseum and wallop No. 17 USC. Heck, I’m not sure I would bet against it.
Still, even if USC loses horribly, the Trojans currently boast the better program. Let me clarify my reasoning: The Ducks are empirically the better team in 2012, but they are not as well-situated as the Trojans for long-term success for three primary reasons.
First, Oregon coach Chip Kelly’s wandering eyes must make Oregon fans uneasy. Just this past offseason, Kelly seriously entertained the thought of bolting to the NFL and becoming the head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He didn’t just entertain the thought; in fact, he was on the verge of finalizing the contract.
He ultimately declined, but who’s to say that Kelly’s interests still aren’t piqued by the prospect of testing his “gimmicky” offensive schemes against the world’s best professional talent? What if a better NFL franchise comes a-knocking with a better contract offer?
There’s little mystery surrounding Oregon’s success: Kelly recruits talent that suits his schemes. In both of his years as Oregon’s offensive coordinator, the Ducks led the Pac-10 in scoring — 38.1 points per game in 2007 and 41.9 in 2008.
Since his promotion to head coach in 2009, Kelly’s record is 49-6 and his teams have never finished worse than 11th in the Associated Press poll at the end of the season.
Without Kelly, Oregon isn’t nearly the nemesis it has been for USC lately. Now, if only some NFL team wanted to take a flier on USC coach Lane Kiffin.
Second, swept aside amid another national title quest is the fact that Oregon awaits sanctions, although, given the glacial pace of the NCAA Committee on Infractions’ investigation, it might be some time before we know their severity. Oregon is currently under investigation for its association with Willie Lyles — a self-professed “street agent.”
Oregon reportedly sent Lyles’ business a $25,000 check. Lyles later claimed that Oregon paid him to steer big-name recruits, such as LaMichael James and Lache Seastrunk, to Eugene. Though the reliability of Lyles’ word is dubious, the NCAA initiated an investigation into the allegations in September 2011.
For Oregon fans, the investigation is a ticking time-bomb ready to blow just as the program is peaking.
Lastly, for all of Oregon’s success, USC still recruits better even amid sanctions. Sure, Oregon will poach the occasional De’Anthony Thomas or five-star defensive lineman Arik Armstead from USC’s backyard, but the Trojans’ Southern Californian recruiting field is plentiful and they have much better success recruiting nationally. The Trojans flaunt tradition, weather and, quite obviously, California girls.
USC’s 2013 football recruiting class, which is already fully assembled with 18 recruits (including at least three early enrollees), is the consensus top recruiting haul in the nation so far; Oregon is No. 23.
At some point in time, a lack of recruiting stars will catch up to Oregon. After all, you can only coach up lesser talent to an extent.
For the three reasons given above, Oregon’s recent success is unsustainable. Have the Ducks established themselves as USC’s greatest competitor for the foreseeable future? Of course.
But their program’s foundation has cracks that even Nike’s wads of cash can’t seal.
—
Counterpoint: The Pac-12 is experiencing a changing of the guard, as Oregon has won more than half of its last 14 meetings with USC. 
Yes, USC, for the better part of the last century, has been the top dog when it comes to college football on the West Coast. And the number of championships and Rose Bowl titles the program has to its name only further illustrates that. Few will argue otherwise. The Trojans have won 11 national championships — California is the next closest conference foe with five.
But USC’s historic pedigree continues to be overshadowed by Oregon’s recent run of success, particularly this season where the Trojans, once atop most preseason polls, are suddenly 6-2 after Saturday’s three-point loss at Arizona, while the Ducks rank No. 4 nationally at 8-0 — nearing a potential berth in the BCS title game.
This season evidently serves as a glimpse of a larger, ongoing development in the Pac-12: Oregon stands poised to displace USC as the conference’s premier program. We’re amid the unseating, so grab your popcorn or cover your eyes, depending on what jersey you’re wearing.
Here are just the recent results. Though USC holds an edge all-time in the series at 38-18-2, Oregon has won eight of the last 14 games since 1994, in addition to wins in two of the last three seasons with Chip Kelly as head coach. And the margin of those two wins over ’SC came by 27 and 21 points. Forget Notre Dame, forget UCLA and forget Stanford, the Trojans’ most daunting foe over the last decade has been Oregon: old-school tradition versus new-age flash.
This changing of the guard has been coming for a while.
Kelly has unmistakably built Oregon into not just one of the conference’s elite programs but one of the nation’s, leading the Ducks to a 42-6 mark during his tenure in Eugene.
And sure, Kelly might have a wandering eye when it comes to the NFL (don’t most coaches, by the way?), but the program, with Nike money and all, appears to be moving at 100 miles per hour no matter who’s sporting the visor on the sidelines.
Let’s be honest: Should Oregon, which comes to the Coliseum on Saturday for a primetime, nationally televised matchup against USC, upend the Trojans to seemingly put themselves in the driver’s seat for a fourth-consecutive conference crown, wouldn’t they be the prohibitive top dog? It’d be hard to contend otherwise, really.
As much as fans might opt to point to last season’s victory over the Ducks at Autzen Stadium and 10-win finish, the USC program still has not won a Pac-12 championship since the 2008 season, when Mark Sanchez was under center.
You can fault a coaching change, postseason ban, scholarship reduction or anything else you’d like, but the results are the results.
It feels like USC is losing its stranglehold. Of course, the Trojans had a near-decade run of dominance under former coach Pete Carroll from 2002-08, but it’s fallen short to Oregon in recent years — on the field, in the standings and in the polls.
Things might change Saturday — USC might very well pull off the upset. But as of late and looking forward, especially as the program faces upcoming scholarship reductions for 2013 and 2014, there aren’t enough reasons to suggest Oregon’s slowing down.
We’re watching the passing of the torch.

Neil Macready, who helped create the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies and the USC Dornsife Board of Councilors, was appointed senior associate dean for advancement in the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences effective Dec. 10.
Macready, a USC alumnus, currently serves as vice president for university relations at the University of Redlands but previously worked at USC for nine years, according to a statement released Wednesday. During his time at USC, Macready worked as USC Dornsife’s director of development from 1995-1999.
Dornsife Dean Steve A. Kay said Macready’s past experience will help Kay work more effectively.
“With more than 30 departments and programs and dozens of research centers and institutes, USC Dornsife requires a broad range of fundraising skills and experience,” Kay said in the statement. “As a USC Dornsife alumnus and a 27-year advancement professional, I believe Neil is perfectly suited to lead our Office of Advancement toward exciting new heights.”
Macready’s responsibilities include improving the possible-donor pool for major gifts and advising USC President C. L. Max Nikias and other senior administrators.
“We look forward to his leadership of the USC Dornsife advancement program and his contributions to USC’s overall fundraising efforts,” Al Checcio, senior vice president for university advancement, said in a statement.
USC launched a $6 billion fundraising campaign last September — the largest fundraising campaign in American higher education at the time of the announcement.
Macready received bachelor’s degrees in political science and geography from USC in addition to a master’s degree in sports management at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. During Macready’s senior year at USC, he served as captain of the men’s swim team.

A new smoke-free ban at UCLA, which was announced Tuesday, has re-energized the debate surrounding the implementation of a smoke-free ban on campus at USC.
UCLA is the first of the UC schools to put a restriction on smoking on campus.
Restrictions · UCLA announced a smoking ban Tuesday, prompting some to ask if USC, which allows smoking on campus, will do the same. – Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan
USC currently follows the same rules as California legislation: Smoking is not allowed inside public establishments, and smokers have to be at least 20 feet from a building to light up. To accommodate students who do not smoke, there are multiple designated smoke-free areas around campus.
As of spring 2012, 14.4 percent of USC students smoked daily or one or more days a week, according to a report by the USC American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment. The same study found that undergraduates smoke more frequently than graduate students.
Student reactions have been fairly positive to the designated smoking areas and the current rules about smoking. Many students, however, are opposed to adopting a ban on smoking.
Henrique Malvar, a senior majoring in political science, and a smoker, opposes having a smoke-free campus.
“I’m a courteous smoker so I’m fine with having a designated smoking area,” Malvar said. “It’s not fair for someone to walk out of a building expecting to get fresh air and instead gets a whiff of nicotine. But if you do a full-on ban that’s just too extreme.”
Some non-smoking students also are satisfied with the current smoking rules and do not see a need for a change.
“There’s already too many rules,” said Emily Frank, a junior majoring in business administration. “We are all college students so we have the right to choose if we want to smoke or not.”
Yet other students believe that smoking should be more restricted on campus and match up with the no-smoking ban that UCLA adopted. One such student, Sydney Golombek, a sophomore majoring in American studies and ethnicity, said she is in favor of USC going smoke-free.
“I think there should be a ban,” Golombek said. “It’s much safer and healthier and I’m all for that on campus.”
Last year, Undergraduate Student Government held a forum and distributed surveys to determine student interest in having a smoking ban on campus. Because some of the survey data was skewed, this year’s student government is redistributing the surveys. Last year, USG presented a senate resolution that favored keeping the current policy for smoking, yet advocating that the school better inform the students of the smoking rules.
USG Campus Director, Wiley Strahan, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies, said student government is working to gauge student interest in implementing more stringent smoking regulations on campus.
“We’re looking to see what the students feel with the climate on campus,” Strahan said. “It’ll be a few weeks before we can start moving forward, but right now we’re looking at what other large, private universities are doing with their smoking rules.”
USG President Mikey Geragos believes USG has to get feedback from the student body before they can take a stance on a smoke-free campus.
“We are taking a more comprehensive approach this year,” Geragos said. “We’re not sure if we’re advocating for a ban or not yet. We’re not trying to make a decision without knowing what the students will want first.”
USC has never had a ban on smoking on its University Park campus.
Though student input is important, health professionals believe the health benefits outweigh temporal student opinions.
The director of the office of wellness and health promotion, Paula Swinford, works with enhancing student wellness and reducing health risks for students on campus. Swinford remains an advocate for a smoke-free campus.
“There’s nothing good about smoking,” Swinford said. “You’re basically choosing to shorten your quantity and quality of life, but unfortunately it’s such an ingrained part of our culture.”
Some students oppose the smoking ban because they also believe that smoking is too ubiquitous to regulate.
“Smoking is already banned everywhere in California,” said Aneesa Al-Musawwir, a junior majoring in jazz studies. “I don’t know how much more strict these rules can get.”
Though student reaction is mixed, Swinford emphasized the importance of implementing a ban in light of UCLA’s newest policy. She said this is especially important considering students who make it through college without smoking are unlikely to smoke throughout the rest of their life.
“A student who goes to UCLA and lives on their smoke-free campus will graduate healthier than a USC student living in an environment of smoking,” Swinford said. “There is really no reason to not move forward on a smoke-free campus. It’s just a matter of when. I’m just surprised that UCLA had to beat us to it.”
I am disgusted when I get smoke in my lungs walking around campus.  This needs to be banned completely.  Step it up USC. 
Decent security on campus wouldn’t hurt either.
I agree!! Smoking is not only unhealthy but nasty.  Have you ever kissed a person that smokes? I hate the way people who smoke  smell when I’m in class and they sit next to me.  USC please step up to the plate and make campus more healthy by banning smoking!!!
I hope USC follows UCLA with the ban.  When we recently attended parents weekend the only negative on campus on game day was the people walking around smoking, especially the cigar people! YUCK.
If you want to be healthy and safe, choose somewhere to live other than Los Angeles.
The USC Catalina Campus has had a smoke-free policy for the last few years. Smoking is only allowed within 5 feet of four ash tray locations at the facility. The system reduces the potential for second hand smoke, cigarette butts littered all over the place, and the risk of brush fires. It has worked quite well and had good compliance.
Pretty sad that UCLA beat us to this.  We will catch up one day.

Citibank donated $150,000 Wednesday to continue the USC Bridges to Business Success program, which supports minority small business owners in the real estate management industry.
The gift will allow approximately 58 new participants to take an eight-week course at USC to further develop their businesses. The program focuses on navigating legal and regulatory issues in real estate and also covers business presentation analysis and project management training.
USC Bridges launched in January, and its first class of 42 students graduated in April. Graduates of the program have created more than 100 jobs in Los Angeles and have had a 100 percent success rate in bidding on and winning governmental contracts.
Bob Annibale, global director of Citi Community Development and microfinance, said he supports the USC Bridges program because of its mission of giving back to the community.
“Citi is proud to help business owners in Southern California receive the resources they need to succeed, grow and create jobs,” Annibale said in a press release. “Part of Citi’s mission is to empower individuals through financial independence, and through this innovative program we will reach hundreds of minority entrepreneurs and business owners, providing valuable training, networking opportunities and technical assistance.”
Citi Community Development originally funded the program with a gift of $60,000.
Other supporters of the program include USC’s Minority Business Development Agency Business Center, the Los Angeles Mayor’s Office of Economic and Business Policy, the Los Angeles Housing Department, the Southern California Minority Business Development Institute, the Small Business Administration’s Service Corps of Retired Executives, the Latino Business Chamber of Greater Los Angeles, the Black Business Association and the Asian Business Association.

USC Democratic and Republican students discussed the policies of their respective candidates, President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney, in a debate Wednesday night in hope of gathering a few more votes in the last days before the election.
Engagement · Christian Patterson (left), current events director for Trojans for Obama, and Fritz Pielstick, political director of College Democrats, discuss Obama’s platform on Wednesday. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
Panelists included Maddy Lansky, president of USC College Republicans; Alex Yebri, president of Trojans for Romney; Fritz Pielstick, political director of USC College Democrats; and Christian Patterson, current events director of Trojans for Obama. USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics Director Dan Schnur moderated the debate.
The panelists faced off on topics ranging from healthcare and economics to foreign policy.
In her opening statement, Lansky emphasized the struggles she and her peers currently face as graduating seniors looking for employment and the ongoing economic difficulties facing the United States.
“My friends and I are freaking out about our job prospects. The economy is still in the tank. We’re looking to move back home with our parents,” Lansky said. “I don’t think this is the hope and change that anyone voted for four years ago, when they voted for Barack Obama.”
The Republicans also said Romney’s plan encourages the growth of businesses by reducing corporate taxes and his policy against raising taxes for private citizens would most effectively reduce the federal deficit.
Democrats underscored the successes of Obama’s stimulus package and the bailout of the automobile industry in creating and saving jobs. They also highlighted the necessity of lowering taxes on the middle class to encourage spending, while raising taxes on the wealthy.
“You cut spending across the board … but you can’t just cut spending,” Pielstick said. “You need to increase taxes on the people the who have the greatest capacity to pay them, the wealthy people of this country, and that’s what President Obama is going to do.”
Panelists also debated the economic and social advantages and disadvantages of Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The students in favor of Romney pointed out that Obama’s health care plan lacked bipartisan support, and expressed the importance of restoring funding to Medicare and Medicaid as well as awarding states more control of healthcare.
Democrats said the reforms succeeded in ensuring that more Americans had access to affordable, quality healthcare.
“Thirty million people didn’t have access to healthcare in this country, and people were dying because they couldn’t afford it,” Patterson said. “He saw a crisis, he saw people were suffering, and he saw that Republicans weren’t willing to do anything about it.”
The panelists from both parties agreed that Iran is currently the United States’ chief foreign threat. However, Democrats advocated for multilateral military engagement should the U.S. need to intervene further, while Republicans said that it is important to keep a U.S.-run option on the table.
“Different situations warrant different responses, especially in the international arena when things get very complicated very quickly,” Lansky said. “However, multilateral action isn’t always effective. We simply don’t have the time sometimes to just wait for the U.N. to approve of everything we do.”
Each side used their closing statement to emphasize their candidate’s qualifications for improving the nation’s economy and advocate for the safety and civil liberties of American citizens.

There are two kinds of long-distance relationships: hard ones and harder ones.
I’m not going to lie, I get called a pessimist quite frequently. Apparently, my advice on love can be a bit hard to swallow.
To make things perfectly clear: I am not a pessimist. I love love. I love relationships. I love weddings, hand holding and romantic texts. I’m the girl who buys wedding magazines for fun. I’m the girl who stays up all night talking to my friends about their new crushes. I’m the black Katherine Heigl/Jennifer Aniston/Kate Hudson of the non-romcom world (but hopefully without being annoying).
So no, I am not a pessimist. What I am, however, is realistic — and there remains a clear difference between the two. I have lived my life thus far with pretty low expectations, and though some might call that depressing, I call it genius. If you constantly have low expectations, then you’re constantly surprised by how awesome life is.
I received some flak for my first column. It seems readers were dismayed when I told them their high school relationships wouldn’t last a semester in college: “As much as it might pain you, it’s much better to split up with your significant other on good terms now than to see it drag out in the mud later … College is a time of growth and learning, not a time of being chained down by someone you only see on FaceTime.”
I didn’t write this because I was trying to ruin someone’s happiness. I was merely speaking about an isolated situation. Long-distance relationships left over from high school are in a whole other ballgame than those that happen when one is older.
I still adamantly believe you should not go into your first year of college in a long-distance relationship. Even if things are going swimmingly, you and your partner need a few months to grow, to be independent and to live your lives. People change during college, and there’s no way you can stop it.
It’s really that simple. Eighteen-year-olds should not be sacrificing their independence for the sake of a high-school relationship — end of story.
Long-distance relationships beginning in college, however, carry their own set of rules.
Many Trojans will spend their next semester abroad, an opportunity that students should take advantage of if they so desire. A good number of these Trojans are probably leaving behind a loved one. And half of those Trojans are probably debating whether or not to stay together while their partner is halfway across the world, on a different continent.
To that I say: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. If your relationship is going well and it’s been long enough, then the relationship can probably withstand a few months of being apart from each other. Distance might make you two stronger, because the small trials and tribulations that come along with adult relationships can let you know if this is for real or not.
One USC junior, who wished to remain anonymous, had to sit down with her beau to decide if they wanted to continue, though she’s off to Europe in the spring.
“I’m more sad [about being apart] than nervous,” she said. “We’re staying together, [and] he’s planning a trip to visit me. We got into a relationship knowing that we want it to be long-term.”
Another USC senior, who also wished to remain anonymous, had the same idea. Though she was travelling halfway across the world for half a year, her relationship was valuable enough for her to keep it going.
“We both knew that what we had was worth sticking it out for the [next] six months,” she said. “So we basically decided to stay together but to try an open relationship. In the end, neither one of us acted on the open part — neither of us hooked up with anyone else.”
These two played it smart. By discussing these sort of matters in mature and logistical ways — and without letting your heart mess with your head — you and your loved one can come to a sensible plan.
After freshman year, one has a pretty good idea of who they are, and not much will change into early adulthood. Just think about it: How different were you freshman year as compared to now? That’s why I say freshmen should hold off on attempting to continue a long-distance relationship into college — it’ll stunt their growth.
It might seem like we’ll be with our boyfriends and girlfriends forever when that really is not the case. Sure, there are some couples who will certainly survive the transition and move onto marriage, a three-bedroom colonial and a Labrador Retriever. But let’s be real: The majority of couples from high school are not going to work out in the long run. It’s better just to accept that failure is OK and move on.
I’m not trying to rain on your parade or be a Debbie Downer, I’m just trying to help you see the light. No one wants to be delusional, a la Taylor Swift, but we all have the chance to fall in love — just when the time is right.
So stop the clock from ticking. We should be in no rush. If it feels right, then it feels right, but don’t stop yourself from growing. No amount of Skyping, visiting, phone calls, snail mail or owl delivery will make the distance easier, but if you feel mature enough to carry on, then it’s worth it.
So bon voyage, my friends, and remember that whatever you choose is up to you. You’ll probably be asking many people for some advice, but please listen to your heart. It knows what to do.

Even those who never picked up one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s stories nor looked at one of the adaptations know the character Sherlock Holmes. He’s been portrayed as everything from a drugged-up delusional madman to a buffoon to a near-omniscient genius — always a brilliant but flawed man.
It’s odd, then, that the latest Holmes adaptation is getting so much hatred from fans of another major television version. Elementary, CBS’s new Thursday night drama, has been under attack by some fans of BBC’s Sherlock. Both shows feature Holmes and Watson solving mysteries in the 21st century, but some Sherlock fans are denouncing Elementary as a ripoff or simply inferior and not worthy of Conan Doyle’s vision. Not only are those arguments premature, they’re wildly off base, especially since Elementary is quite good.
But first, some background: The idea of modernizing Holmes is nothing new. Basil Rathbone’s series of Holmes films in the 1930s and 1940s brought Holmes into the present day after a few adventures. BBC’s Sherlock was the first to bring Holmes into the new millennium, part of a recent trend to try to do Doyle justice.
But until recently, Holmes has been based more on a stereotype or parody of the character. Rathbone’s films, however enjoyable, helped push the image of the detective always clad in a deerstalker cap. And Nigel Bruce’s comedic relief forever marred the character of Dr. Watson as a large idiot, constantly having to be told the obvious.
Jeremy Brett, in a series of adaptations in the 1980s, brought Doyle’s text to life by providing the truest-to-the-books, Victorian version of the character. In terms of series length and accuracy, this television series is the best attempt to adapt the books to the screen.
But in the last few years, there has been an attempt to return to Doyle’s takes on Holmes and Watson that, although lacking the length of Brett’s run, stay true to the books.
Guy Ritchie’s two Sherlock Holmes films, even with a very kinetic and manic tone, are the best recent take on the characters yet. Jude Law’s Watson is probably the best portrayal of the doctor, very much the opposite of Bruce’s buffoon. Game of Shadows featured not only Jared Harris’s perfect Moriarty, but also a version of “The Final Problem” that did the story justice.
BBC’s Sherlock is full of references to Doyle’s text and crams numerous story plots into each episode of its very short seasons. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Holmes is very inhuman and distant, and the episodes themselves have far higher stakes than the original stories do, especially in the second season. It’s a great show, but perhaps suffers from trying to do too much at one time.
Both of these are equally valid versions of Sherlock Holmes. And with Elementary, there is now a third great, valid take on the Great Detective.
Though it’s still early in its season, the show is already showing itself to be a success. And that success comes from its cast.
Doyle described Holmes as Bohemian, brilliant, acerbic and troubled with boredom. Jonny Lee Miller’s Holmes is all that, and also very human. His take on the character is the center of a rather fun spin on the Holmes mythology.
In CBS’s version, Holmes is still a whip-smart consulting detective, but something happened to him in London that forced him to worsen his drug addiction. After a stint in rehab, he’s moved to New York City, where he is set up with a sober companion, former surgeon Joan Watson (Lucy Liu).
As Holmes, Miller is a broken genius. Instead of the more omniscient takes on the character by Rathbone and Cumberbatch, Miller’s version of Holmes doesn’t instantly figure things out. He can still deduce answers easily and is still the smartest person in the room, but he has to do more legwork. And the drug addiction element isn’t just for set up; it plays deeply into a self-loathing Holmes. The mystery of what exactly happened to him in London looks to be a driving force behind the show and one that serves both the plot and the character.
Liu’s Watson is equally interesting. Watson isn’t a simpleton, but rather a force of seriousness next to Holmes’ sarcastic nature and eccentricities. The chemistry between the two is platonic, which is odd for television. The interactions between Liu and Miller, then, can be more fascinating than the cases they’re solving.
Elementary dives into aspects either ignored or marginalized by other recent versions. Holmes’ NYPD contact, Gregson (Aidan Quinn), comes from the original stories, as does Holmes’ drug addiction. It’s a fresh element that helps set the show apart.
If there’s a major problem with Elementary as it starts its first season, it’s that it’s a procedural. Crime procedurals basically blot television today, offering formulaic series where each episode is just a “case of the week” instead of serialized stories or a greater mythology. Elementary is helped by the fact that it’s Sherlock Holmes lending his unique form of deduction and crime fighting to solve each case. But the mysteries themselves, although somewhat clever, feel generic.
Elementary is a great take on the Great Detective and has strong promise. It’s unique from other adaptations, but still a valid and interesting look at Doyle’s hero. If it can bring in more of Doyle’s cases and story elements rather than more generic crimes of the week then it could be one of the best Sherlock Holmes adaptations yet. Until it does, it’s a flawed but good show, well worth checking out.
I’ve been a Holmes fan forever, so I was a little skeptical of Elementary at first. A few buddies that work at DISH with me weren’t sure that the attempt to reshape Watson entirely would go over well either. But after catching up on all of the episodes on my DISH Hopper, Miller and Liu are very good. I’ve even watched some of the scenes multiple times. It’s nice to have a DVR with enough recording space to let me save everything I want to for those nights I feel nostalgic. Cheers to a new show with strong history.
“Guy Ritchie’s two Sherlock Holmes films, even with a very kinetic and manic tone, are the best recent take on the characters yet. Jude Law’s Watson is probably the best portrayal of the doctor, very much the opposite of Bruce’s buffoon. Game of Shadows featured not only Jared Harris’s perfect Moriarty, but also a version of “The Final Problem” that did the story justice.” – Great to know that there is someone who loves these movies and sees their true value.
Agree with you about BBC Sherlock and CBS Elementary as well.
Great article, Nicholas. Hats off to you!
With regards to CBS Elementary, I have noticed some references to the Canon in each episode. Check out my reviews and let me know what you think.
Cheers!
Nice review! It’s good to see that Elementary is getting good press, because the way the BBC fans act is atrocious.  I can understand the fans of Sherlock getting angry at the timing but they need to understand that there version isn’t the first and he will not be the last. Yes, BBC Sherlock is good, but its not the end all be all of Sherlock Holmes. In the future I’m more than positive there will be more adaptations of Sherlock Holmes done with new twist and turns.
We already had a great modern take on Sherlock Holmes on TV for 8 years. It’s called “House.”
Well said. Great review.
Ignore the first two comments.
for god’s sake… just shut up… who r u…??? An american, I’m sure… U guys are so pathetic… BBC does real justice to the show because of sherlock’s analytical reasoning and capability to deduce just by hearing out stuff.. Elementary is pathetic… It does not bring out the true powers of the holmes as portrayed by doyle… But BBC really does a gud job there…
and joan watson…??? for god’s sake… cut the crap… cant u guys not spare one show….?? all that the american programmes showcase have an element of romance and adult stuff in it… u cant get beyond the concept of a man-woman romance, can you..?? watson and holmes were friends… for god’s sake dont bring romance into it.. this is so pathetic…
rotten tomatoes for the show and the authour of this article who brags about it so much..
Elementary is a totally generic US procedural with totally generic lead characters. The only reason I can see that they’re named Holmes and Watson is to cash in on the success of the BBC and the Ritchie franchises. Otherwise these characters could be named Smith and Jones and it wouldn’t change a thing. Boring and inferior.

The world-renowned Scottish disc jockey Calvin Harris delivers his third studio album, 18 Months, in a somewhat dry season for the music industry. The album, released under Columbia Records, was released for public download and purchase on Oct. 30 and remains a highlight among fall album releases.
Diverse DJ · Calvin Harris experiments with new sounds, including hip-hop and soul beats, on his latest release, 18 Months. The DJ is also joined by popular artists such as Ellie Goulding and Tinie Tempeh who benefit from Harris’ poppy and heavily synthesized setting in stellar songs like “I Need Your Love” and “Drinking from the Bottle.” – | Photo credit RUKES, courtesy of Mitch Schneider Organization
The majority of 18 Months should not be a surprise for avid Harris fans, or even for those merely familiar with the Billboard Top 100 chart. Multiple tracks have made impressive appearances on the chart and have achieved great mainstream success. “We Found Love,” a collaboration with Rihanna, has been a radio staple for a year. Other singles from this album dropped throughout the year, including “Feel So Close,” “Bounce,” “Awooga,” “I Need Your Love,” “Let’s Go,” “We’ll Be Coming Back” and “Sweet Nothing.”
As far as the whole album goes, it’s meant to be listened to as if it’s a continuous mix, not just a series of singles. Harris cleverly designed the album so that songs are able to cross fade with each other seamlessly. But many tracks do feel more “highlight-worthy” than others.
“Feel So Close” has been a kickback favorite for more than a year now because of its electro-mellow nature. And the incredibly smooth vocals of Harris are surprising for a DJ — people don’t often think a disc jockey can actually sing. The song transitions into a tuneful electro cadence with Harris singing that “[he feels] so close to you right now” — quite the comforting feeling knowing that a world-class DJ is feeling so close to you.
“We Found Love,” which features Rihanna, was praised by popular music critics and charted first on Billboard in Nov. 2011. It is quite the club anthem, and radio stations last year seemed to be aggressively force-feeding listeners the tale of Rihanna finding love in a hopeless place. It is, however, still a solid listen, and this song is truly the epitome of Harris’ musical maturation. The blend and hybrid of sounds he mixes and  the different styles that emerge in the song are upgrades from his hits from yesterday.
It is still apparent, however, that Harris is a huge fan of synthesizers, and the familiar old Harris feel is still dominant on this album.
“We’ll Be Coming Back” is one such example. British rapper Example starts the song with soulful vocals, but those famous Harris synthesizers remain present. Still, the buildup and the drop of this song is also one of the more thrilling moments of this album. The whole track becomes a soulful party anthem that’s recognizably Harris, yet different from what he’s provided before.
Other artists also show new sides of themselves on this album, Ellie Goulding among them. She brings out her vocals in perfection in “I Need Your Love.” It is fascinating and kind of weird to think that Goulding’s voice, soft and high-pitched, can fit so well with hard-knocking house music.
Tinie Tempah also gets an impressive showcase, greatly aided by Harris. In “Drinking From the Bottle,” Harris brings out the dramatic tone changes of Tempah’s rapping with a backdrop crescendo that descends to a solid rhythm as Tempah deepens his voice. On tracks like this one, it’s clear Harris knows how to underline and emphasize the emotions of other artists.
The album’s later songs,  though not as notable, continue to show a maturation and evolution in Harris music. Now an established DJ and producer, Harris showcases more flexibility in his production. “Here 2 China,” which features Dizzee Rascal and Dillon Francis, displays sounds previously not heard  from Harris, such as a very low and thumping bass with a very hip-hop orientated scoring style. This might also be the influence of Dillon Francis, a special fan of 808 and room-shaking bass.
Harris’ new album stands as a very solid effort with lots of current favorites as well as new dance anthems that one should expect to hear relatively soon at many parties; the party playing vibe is strong with this one.
Let’s rage on.
This album is really stellar. I’ve really enjoyed his last two records, I’m glad 18 months wasn’t a letdown. http://smarturl.it/sweetnothingvideo

On Sept. 17, an 11-year-old girl named Khadijah Niazi in Lahore, Pakistan was taking the final exam for a college-level physics class created by a Silicon Valley startup.
Kate Wong | Daily Trojan
As she was watching YouTube videos for the course, Niazi was interrupted by a message telling her the website was no longer available. The Pakistani government had shut down access to YouTube in an effort to block the anti-Muslim film that sparked protests across the Middle East. She was only able to finish the exam with help from people across the world taking the same course online. Her participation in and completion of the physics course was possible for one reason: the intersection of the Internet and education.
An article in Time’s special report on education last week told Niazi’s story to explain the benefits of online education and the role it is playing in American higher education. In an era where student loan debt has been estimated to top the nation’s entire amount of credit card debt, with tuition costs skyrocketing and the question, “Is college worth it?” being asked more and more frequently, online education should be looked at as the missing puzzle piece in solving our higher education crisis.
Online education is not a new phenomenon, but recent investments by top universities have propelled it forward. This May, Harvard University and MIT teamed up to create edX, an online education platform that offers free online versions of both universities’ courses. edX’s technology is also available as open-source software, which means any other university, organization or individual can use edX’s learning platform and even tinker with it to improve the technology. UC Berkeley and the University of Texas have since hopped on the edX train, creating BerkeleyX and UTx.
This is what online education has the power to do — break down the walls blocking access to the nation’s top universities, in turn increasing the quality of many more students’ education while simultaneously slashing the hefty price tag associated with these universities.
Taking education online also makes the experience much more collaborative and interactive on all levels, from Niazi in Pakistan completing her course with the help from a Malaysian student and a physics professor in Portugal to Harvard, MIT, Berkeley and UT coming together to create a bigger and better learning experience for anyone who wants it.
Part of this also comes from the idea of “startup” online education.
The course Niazi was taking in Pakistan was part of Udacity, a for-profit online education platform founded by two Stanford professors who saw that most online courses were of subpar quality and decided to do something about it, completely on their own. Can you imagine what higher education would look like if we transferred the Silicon Valley startup mindset to education?
This is not to say that we should totally abandon traditional learning models or brick-and-mortar university campuses. The problem is that the traditional learning model used at brick-and-mortar college campuses isn’t fully functional anymore, and many students can’t afford to try to make something work that is draining their money and time without much reward.
Online education, supplemented with elements of traditional education that still work and cannot be reproduced online, could restore American higher education to its former glory. And most importantly, it could provide all students, regardless of their socioeconomic status or even location in the world, a chance to be a part of that.
The world as we know it is slowly, but surely, moving online. We no longer solely rely on newspapers for the news, but check their online pages and Twitter for the most recent updates. We no longer fly across the country or world for business meetings in person but instead convene on Skype. Why should the way we learn be any different?
 
Elena Kadvany is a senior majoring in Spanish and is the Daily Trojan’s Editorial Director. Her column “Beyond the Classroom” runs every other Thursday.
I agree with your view of online education, as those who want to learn will show it through these, but it is a much more complicated issue than what you have discussed. For example, how are courses/”certificates” to be treated by potential employers/colleges? How can one trust that the work was done by each individual (there have been multiple cheating issues for courses I have taken online, some of which threatened the existence of the classes themselves). How can students be motivated to do beyond the minimum work to get a passing grade and truly learn? (Let’s be honest: what do you actually remember from the last pass/no pass class you took)
I admire the work of Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig (two of the main guys who started this wave w/ his Intro to AI class) and enjoy classes that I take online (I’m from a CS background myself). However, in my opinion, the classes should be used as a *supplement* (for now) to traditional education.
The main problem with traditional college these days, to me, is the wide availability itself – college isn’t for everyone, nor should it be. It has saturated the admissions process and overall made a degree less valuable. And the problem with this is the entitlement that it brings: if everyone can get one, why can’t I? This extends to the working world: “with a college degree, I deserve a job.” What these online courses do to benefit us is to not only extend our own minds, but differentiate ourselves from other applicants, showing them that we actively seek to learn beyond the basic degree, that we are self-sufficient and take initiative. A degree on the resume might get you in the door, but many times it won’t be enough to close the deal and get the job – this is where online courses can help.
Online education here should supplement what students are already learning that isn’t covered by the university already (or high school, in some cases). Whether these classes become more prominent on their own has yet to be seen – it could take awhile.
Nowadays online education takes all the credit for giving or improving the knowledge in student life. Students prefer to gain knowledge from internet rather than from textbooks.
Thanks

At an Ohio campaign stop in October, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney stated that he would end federal funding of Planned Parenthood if elected. His reasoning for doing so? He is a “pro-life candidate” and would be a “pro-life president.”
This is the kind of delusional reasoning that has dominated the debate over Planned Parenthood, an organization that provides many other services besides abortions. By proposing to cut funding and shut Planned Parenthood’s doors, Romney is effectively dimming the future for women everywhere.
Planned Parenthood’s federally and locally funded clinics have taken an unnecessary and unwarranted beating from conservatives. The general conservative consensus has been that Planned Parenthood is a liberal, anti-religion organization that helps teen mothers abort their babies and gives out condoms to promote salacious sexual activity. Republican Rep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas even said in September, “Besides slavery, abortion is the other darkest stain on our nation’s character,” and called Planned Parenthood a “racist organization.”
As Planned Parenthood has become synonymous with abortion, an unnecessary, polarizing frenzy has taken over debate about the organization. This valuable organization, which was born out of America’s need to combat the problem of inadequate health care provisions for women, has been attacked by unwarranted hysteria.
Conservatives have yet to realize that only 3 percent of Planned Parenthood’s services is dedicated to abortion. The other 97 percent consists of life-saving cancer testing and treatment, advice for contraception, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases and various procedures  unavailable to women who can’t afford private health care, such as pap smears.
Cutting funding for Planned Parenthood will not stop people from having sex, but it will take away an organization that provides sexual health support and services that many women cannot access anywhere else.
Planned Parenthood is simply helping those in need. Instead of fighting the system, it gives young girls the chance to live their lives knowing that there is a place that they can go to for help with serious health issues.
Judging others is natural, but male politicians must cease making decisions on matters that are of no concern to them. Regardless of one’s stance on abortion, he or she has no right to force that opinion upon another. Vice President Joe Biden voiced this idea during the vice presidential debate in October.
“My religion defines who I am, and I’ve been a practicing Catholic my whole life,” he said. “I do not believe that we have a right to tell other people that women can’t control their bodies.”
A program such as Planned Parenthood gives the women of America options and freedom. It allows them to make decisions about their own bodies and to live their life healthfully, to the best of their ability. By shutting Planned Parenthood’s doors, Romney would only reinforce the idea that the U.S. government has appeared to have forgotten about women.
 
Sheridan Watson is a junior majoring in film critical studies.
These people who have answered are men.  Why not speak to women who choose abortion,  ask them 10 years later how they remember they might have a a ten yr old boy or girl and how much they miss that child.I am therefore against abortion, because after having had One 30 yrs ago I still miss my son or daughter every December. we cannot allow women, and young girls make this mistake, there are definitely other ways. As for planned parenthood , yes it does more good, put have you heard the saying ” one bad apple spoils the whole bunch.” well when one thing is bad it’s spoils everything even I. Ones mind . I say reverse the abortion rule, and that will solve the planned parenthood problem.
While planned parenthood talks a good talk and has great marketing, it has plenty of bigotry to expose. Andrew Breitbart did some undercover journalism to expose the fact that the business was founded by racists and has not fully escaped its past.
Regardless, we don’t have the money to give to any organization while we borrow 80-100 billion dollars every month just to keep up with Congress and the White House’s spending habits. If we can’t cut the baby killers marketing budget (planned parenthood is the country’s #1 abortion provider) then what can we cut?
Hey Sheridan-
Sit down and watch a U-Tube video that shows an actual abortion taking place.
Why should others have to pay for this gruesome practice?
Have you lost your mind?
You insult the intelligence and morals of common decency.
USC
Obviously, you didn’t actually read the article but decided to spout off like an ignorant right-wing extremist once you saw the title “Planned Parenthood.” This organization does a lot of good. As a conservative myself, I still recognize that I have no business in how a woman elects to take care of her body. In fact, this helps a lot of them that don’t have the means to do so (as the article states).
As a side note (because you brought it up), I don’t agree with all abortions, especially those that are frivolous or for nothing more than because someone changed their mind, but what about rape victims? What about life-threatening (to the mother) pregnancies? On the border: what about those that won’t have the financial means to provide for a child? Do you honestly want to ruin the lives of those affected by the above conditions?

Sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee was named the Pac-12 Player of the Week on Monday following his record-breaking performance in the Trojans’ loss to Arizona.
Lee had 16 catches for a Pac-12 conference record 345 yards, and was one reception away from tying junior wide receiver Robert Woods’ school record of 17 catches. Lee, who had touchdown grabs of 44 and 49 yards in the second and third quarters along with a 57-yard reception, also blew by Woods’ single-game receiving yards record of 260.
In addition, Lee also returned three kickoffs for 123 yards and ran once for a yard, recording 469 all-purpose yards. That represents the second most all-purpose yards in NCAA history, in addition to the fifth most receiving yards in NCAA history.
However, Lee’s superlative day was not enough to get the Trojans a victory as Arizona scored 26 unanswered points in the second half to turn a 28-13 deficit into a 39-28 lead that they would not relinquish. Arizona sophomore wide receiver Austin Hill also had a banner day, hauling down 10 passes for 259 yards.
Lee’s 255 receiving yards in the first half helped the Trojans jump out to a commanding lead, but mental mishaps doomed the formerly No. 9 Trojans at the hands of unranked Arizona. This is Lee’s second Pac-12 award of the season—he was named Special Teams Player of the Week after he returned a punt 100 yards for a touchdown against Hawaii.

After seven hours of backlash Wednesday, CNN took down an online article suggesting a relationship between women’s hormones and their voting patterns. While the story was both offensive and scientifically unsound, CNN should not have removed it. The network should own up to all of the news it posts—even poor stories—in order to maintain its integrity in media.
The article reported on a study conducted through internet surveys of 275 women with regular menstrual cycles who were not taking a hormonal contraceptive. The study reported that while ovulating, single women appeared more likely to vote for Obama and committed women for Romney, by a margin of at least 20 percent.
It was further purported that “when women are ovulating, they “feel sexier.” This would cause single women to lean toward more liberal views on marriage equality and abortion while committed women, trying to resist these “sexy” urges, would vote more conservatively.
The article immediately received a deluge of scathing but justified criticism. For reducing women to slaves of their hormones, the study was totally unfounded. Its initial hypothesis was discriminatory, meaning the surveys may have reflected a bias that impacted the results. Furthermore, the small sample size, the lack of a control variable and the complete reliance on voluntary response also make the study questionable.
Writer Elizabeth Landau even noted in the article that several political scientists had deemed the conclusions of the study invalid. So why write an article treating it as legitimate? Such journalism plays into the historic misrepresentation of women as untrustworthy and weak because of certain biological “limitations.”
CNN claimed they removed the story for having not passed through the proper editorial channels. Obviously, however, it made it through somehow. As a published piece, the network should have answered for it instead of avoiding confrontation by taking down the post.
CNN’s choice to cover up its mistake rather than confront the question of why such a study was developed to publication in the first place gives readers no reason to trust the network in the future. To earn the trust of the public, CNN must account for its good and its bad publishing decisions. Taking a story down just doesn’t cut it.

Former USC Song Girl Claudene Christian died Monday when the HMS Bounty sank off the coast of North Carolina because of Hurricane Sandy.
Remembrance · Former Song Girl Claudene Christian, who died at 42 in Hurricane Sandy, was remembered by USC coaches Tuesday. – Photo courtesy of Facebook
Christian, 42, was a crew member on the ship, which appeared in several films, including Mutiny on the Bounty and the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, according to CNN.
Christian was a Song Girl in the 1990s and graduated in 1992. She founded a business that makes dolls that look like cheerleaders, the Cheerleader Doll Company, in 1988.
She joined the Bounty’s crew in May. On her Facebook page, she said she joined the crew because she was a descendant of Fletcher Christian, the crewmember who led the mutiny against William Bligh on the original HMS Bounty in 1789, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The ship was en route to St. Petersburg, Fla. from London, Conn. when Hurricane Sandy hit, KTLA reported. The ship reportedly lost power Sunday night and called for the U.S. Coast Guard’s assistance. By 4:30 a.m. Monday, the crew began abandoning ship; Coast Guard rescue helicopters arrived about two hours later, the Times reported.
Fourteen of the 16 crew members were rescued from lifeboats, but Christian was found unresponsive. Her aunt, Patricia Saulsberry, told KFSM that Christian was in the water for nine or 10 hours before rescuers found her. As of Tuesday night, Coast Guard was still searching for the ship’s captain, Robin Walbridge, 63, according to the Times.
“The USC Song Girl Family is deeply saddened by the loss of one of our beautiful former Song Girls, Claudene Christian,” the Song Girls coaches said in a statement. “Our hearts and prayers go out to her parents and family. As a USC Song Girl, Claudene will always be remembered for her kindness, enthusiasm and charismatic personality. Claudene will be missed by all who knew and loved her.”
I didn’t know her, but reading about the person she was makes me sad that I’ll never get the chance. RIP!

A Tuesday evening event took students away from their everyday, campus lives to a contested international relationship: the Israeli-Palesitnian conflict. The event, co-sponsored by USC’s Students for Justice in Palestine, Jewish Voice for Peace-LA and the Levantine Culture Center, featured author and activist Miko Peled, an outspoken critic of Zionism and a firm proponent of peace in the war-ridden region.
Peace · Students for Justice in Palestine hosted Miko Paled, author of “The General’s Son: A Journey of an Israeli in Palestine,” on Tuesday. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
Peled, author of the groundbreaking memoir The General’s Son: Journey of an Israeli in Palestine, remains an outspoken advocate of the unitary state solution, which supports a secular democracy in which Israelis and Palestinians live as equals.
The discussion began with an introduction by moderator Jordan Elgrably, an Arab-Jewish cultural diplomat and director of the Levantine Cultural Center, who dismissed the age-old stereotypes of the region.
“One of the main motivations I have is to impart more cultural literacy in the Middle East,” Elgrably said. “It’s a diverse, interesting place. Not everyone is a crazy settler or a frothing-at-the-mouth Zionist.”
Peled, however, asked audience members if they believed that peace would be achievable in their lifetime. Most answered no.
“I’m 50 years old,” Peled said. “And there’s no question that there will be peace in my lifetime.”
To Peled, American understanding of the conflict is crucial, particularly given the United States’ close relationship with Israel.
“Americans are probably the least informed people on this issue, and they spend the most money on it,” he said. “You would think if you give so much money to an issue, you might want to be informed; $3 billion a year is a lot of money.”
Peled recounted the history of the conflict, dating back to November 1947.
Though highly critical of Israel, Peled ultimately ended on a somber note, speaking about the death of his young niece who died as a result of two suicide bombers.
To Peled, the violence that led to his niece’s death was brought on by the desperation the conflict perpetuates.
“These two young men were brought to such a level of despair and hopelessness that they took their own lives and the lives of innocent Israelis,” he said. “The brutality of the occupation is what brought these people to such a level of despair that they did this — and that has to stop.”
To Peled, peace can only be achieved when Israel becomes a secular democracy, similar to other multinational countries.
“You can’t have a Jewish state when half the population isn’t Jewish and call it a democracy,” he said. “Israelis and Palestinians don’t have to live like this. It can be done, but the name of the game has to be equal rights.”
In closing, Peled highlighted that this conflict is one that can be ended in the same way it was created — by people.
“The reality in Israel and Palestine was created by people,” Peled said. “It can be changed by people.”

USC President C. L. Max Nikias announced Tuesday a $25 million gift from Leonard D. Schaeffer, USC professor and a Judge Robert Maclay Widney Chair. The endowment  is expected to benefit the USC Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics.
The USC Schaeffer Center was established in 2009 with a gift from Schaeffer and his wife, Pamela. Both the USC Price School of Public Policy and the USC School of Pharmacy dually house the Schaeffer Center, uniting the two schools into a single organization that focuses on solving health care issues. Researchers at the Schaeffer Center conduct research in both public policy and pharmaceutical policy, integrating the two for a unique take on healthcare policy in America today. The center also concentrates on predicting the future of health care in the United States.
“Our nation faces grave health and fiscal challenges,” Schaeffer said in a statement. “I support this center because its rigorous, independent and interdisciplinary research provides the foundation for designing effective policies to address these issues in both the public and private sectors.”
According to Sadena Thevarajah, USC Schaeffer Center director of external affairs, the endowment will serve to preserve the long-term sustainability of the center, as well as recruit new faculty members.
“While the endowment will not fund any precise program, it will mainly help us to be able to recruit high-level faculty and researchers who will be fantastic assets to the center’s goals,” Thevarajah said. “The donation will also really allow us to continue to grow in the research of health policy the center has already really quickly excelled in.”
The research done at the Schaeffer Center doesn’t focus solely on fixing problems with health care policy, though; it also seeks to come up with policy solutions that will benefit future U.S. health care policies.
“We project and model what health care costs will be like in the future based on current claims,” Thevarajah said. “So, researchers will look at current Medicare claims and be able to project what costs will be burdening the country in the future, and that will allow us to create policy solutions that can hedge for and prepare for that.”
Ariana Wall, a senior majoring in economics, said the center will support her professional aspirations to curb childhood obesity through health care reform.
“I want to use my economics background to work in public health care so this center is exactly what would help me further my career path,” Wall said. “The center will certainly help to bolster USC’s status as a top research university.”
Professor Glenn Alan Melnick, director of the Center for Health Policy and Management and an expert in public policy issues relating to health care access, said the endowment not only benefits the Schaeffer Center, but also health care research on the West Coast in general.
“This center is significant for the West Coast because most of the policy centers are on the East Coast,” Melnick said. “This gift now establishes a large, well-financed, sustainable center which will allow West Coast researchers and what’s happening in this part of the country to influence health care policy. It turns out that a lot of the innovation in health care comes from California, but has a hard time making it across the country because of the policy makers.”
The Schaeffer Center has received more than $45 million in external research funding, helping it become one of the nation’s leading policy institutions, with its research having been featured in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Politico and National Public Radio.
Jon Miller, a freshman majoring in global health, said the donation puts USC at the forefront of an extremely important research area.
“Our future is dependent on research,” he said, “and while global health is a rapidly changing field, this donation is going to allow USC to make profound changes and continue to grow in the rankings.”
His donations eminate from his Guilt?

The Undergraduate Student Government passed three pieces of legislation at its Tuesday meeting — the most it has approved at one time this year.

The student leaders passed an amendment that will streamline funding to new organizations, granted fall exceptional allocations to student organizations  and passed a resolution to recognize USC Olympians.
The bylaw amendment affects how discretionary start-up funds are allocated to first-year student organizations and clubs. Previously, there were no specific guidelines for organizations applying for funding.
USG Treasurer Jennifer Guan, a senior majoring in neuroscience and psychology, said she felt the discretionary funding needed more exposure.
“It has been in existence, but was not well utilized or advertised,” Guan said. “Our goal is to make the process for this funding a lot more transparent and a have set of guidelines for everyone to follow.”
Organizations that apply for discretionary start-up funding can now receive $500 a semester, compared to the $400 in previous years.
Kameron VanWoerkom, the director of the USG discretionary fund and a junior majoring in accounting and business, believes the funding amendment will make the application process easier for organizations and provide them with the support they need.
“We want them to come out of the gates a step ahead,” VanWoerkom said. “This is easily beneficial because it gives them a better advantage to establish their brand as a student organization.”
In addition to the start-up money from the discretionary fund, fall exceptional allocations will also fund student organizations within Program Board. The goal for these allocations is to help organizations increase the quality of their events throughout the year.
Each semester, the university grants student government money based on student enrollment. Each student pays a programming fee in his or her tuition cost, and with the increase in student enrollment this year, an additional $70,000 was available in the fall exceptional fund.
USG President Mikey Geragos, Vice President Vinnie Prasad, Senator Matthew Arkfeld, Senator Vicken Antounian and Guan worked to allocate more money to the 13 entities within Program Board to help fund their programs.
Juan Espinoza, Program Board director and a senior majoring in communication and international relations, said the additional funding should benefit student organizations.
“All of the organizations have these projects and plans that they want to make happen,” Espinoza said. “So these funds help them out with helping them fulfill that vision and make the best things happen for the student body.”
For student leaders specifically, the increased funding will have a direct impact on the students involved in their organizations.
Lamar Gary, a junior majoring in business administration and the director of the Black Student Assembly, said having adequate funding makes a big difference in what the organization offers students.
“There’s a lot of start-up costs … going in and we don’t always have all the money we need in our budget,” Gary said. “We definitely wouldn’t have been able to fulfill all of our goals and we would have to cut some of our events or downsize them.”
The Alumni Affairs Committee also put forth the resolution to formally recognize USC Olympians at the homecoming football game Nov. 10 versus Arizona State. The committee believes it will positively impact the student body.
Antounian, one of the sponsors for this resolution, also hopes it will strengthen the student spirit on campus.
“It’s a great idea for both students and alumni,” Antounian said. “It will bring the Olympian spirit to life and show everyone that Trojans are always fighting on. The Olympians are true Trojan heroes.”
