Dr. Michael Fong, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine, remains in the hospital following a car accident involving a West Hollywood Sheriff’s patrol car on Thursday.
According to NBC4 News, Fong was in critical condition on Friday but his family reported he was doing OK on Saturday. 
The crash, which was reported at 11:15 p.m. Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, left one dead and three injured, including Fong.
Two sheriff’s deputies were responding to a domestic violence call when their car struck another vehicle near the intersection of Santa Monica and San Vicente boulevards and spun onto the sidewalk, hitting two pedestrians. All four men were transported to local hospitals.
The other pedestrian was identified as Jonathan Peña, a 27-year-old man from Los Angeles, according to NBC4 News. Peña later succumbed to his injuries in the hospital. The two deputies remained hospitalized as of Saturday.

On the run · The Undergraduate Student Government’s Special Events Committee, Trojan Pride and the USC Triathalon team organized a Zombie 5K run Friday night in Pardee Plaza where “zombies” chased participants. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
On Friday night, the Special Event Committee, Trojan Pride and USC Triathalon partnered to throw the Zombie Run 5K in Pardee Plaza.
Participants were given flags and ran two laps around campus while Undergraduate Student Government members painted by makeup artists to look like zombies chased them. The ”zombies” were only allowed to use two limbs to try and take the runners’ flags while they ran around campus.
The event was promoted by a social media campaign that had Trojan Pride members and other members of USG change their profile pictures to “zombified” versions of themselves.
Trojan Pride Program Director Joshua Chang thought that it was the energy of both the volunteers and the participants that made the event such a success.

“The zombies did a great job of scaring all the runners, and I’m glad everyone had a fun time. The impromptu dance party at the end with all the participants was probably the most random and entertaining thing that happened,” Chang said. “I want to thank all the participants and volunteers for making this an outstanding event.”
Patrick Macias, a sophomore majoring in industrial and systems engineering, enjoyed seeing so many organizations collaborate together to create a unique experience.
“It was a lot of fun to participate in, and it was great to see so many different organizations coming together to run an event.”
Avery McEvoy, a junior majoring in environmental engineering, also found the experience enjoyable and unique, as well as eye-opening.
“The Zombie Run turned out to be an amazing event. It was hilarious to see Trojans coming together not only to run a 5K, but to also be chased by zombies,” Evoy said via email. “The zombies were very dedicated and realistic, and I definitely heard screams all around campus. This event convinced me of two things. One, I may be less equipped to survive a zombie apocalypse than I thought. Two, Trojans know how to have fun.”

Students and community members gathered on Trousdale Parkway Sunday morning in preparation for the Bike on Fig to CicLAvia event, which gave riders a chance to explore the heart of Los Angeles on “car-free” streets. The event was coordinated by BikeSafe USC, a coalition of several different campus groups, and also featured booths from Transportation, Sustainability and Student Wellness.
Bikers met on campus at 9:30 a.m. to participate in bike safety activities, learn new skills and prepare for the ride to CicLAvia. CicLAvia allows cyclists to explore popular neighborhoods such as Downtown, Chinatown, Little Tokyo and East L.A., without regular automobile traffic.
“I hadn’t done the original Heart of LA CicLAvia — although I’ve been here for four years now and have participated in [other] events over [the past] three-and-a-half years — because I’ve always been sick or out of town,” said Lena Uszkoreit, a Ph.D student in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism studying communication. “[I’m] really excited about doing the original one.”
Community member Uzoma Mmeje said the event allowed him to learn more about safety protocols, and also to register his bike on campus.
“Now, any time we’re on campus, we can actually have that record,” Mmeje said.
According to BikeSafe USC coordinator Alison Kendall, the project was funded with a city of Los Angeles grant and also had a consulting team with expertise in biking to help and inform bikers. Student groups, including the Environmental Students Assembly and the Associated Students of Planning and Development, also helped coordinate and publicize the event.
Kendall said the event was designed in anticipation of the MyFigueroa project, which intends to improve streets around the area.
“The MyFigueroa project is incredibly exciting for Los Angeles because it’s what’s called a ‘complete streets project,’” Kendall said. “It’s one of the few street improvement projects that actually prioritizes pedestrians, cyclists and transit users over car drivers.”
In addition to promoting the project, Kendall hopes that the Bike on Fig to CicLAvia will encourage more students and community members to use bike riding as their form of transportation.
“Biking is a great way to have fun, stay fit, get around and also use your car less and pollute less, so it’s just wonderful on every single front,” Kendall said. “What we hope is that people become good bike citizens, that they become aware of how they can stay safe and how they can protect the pedestrians.”

Bizarre bazaar · The USC Libraries’ 10th annual Los Angeles Archives Bazaar covered a wide range of topics pertaining to Los Angeles’s history. The exhibit was held in Doheny Library on Saturday. – Marie McCoy-Thompson | Daily Trojan
On Saturday, USC Libraries held its 10th annual Los Angeles Archives Bazaar in Doheny Library.
The event was put on by LA as Subject, a consortium within USC Libraries dedicated to preserving the history of Los Angeles.
Tyson Gaskill, executive director of communications and events for USC Libraries, discussed how the variety of panels appealed not just to people interested in history, but also to those who may be interested in the popular culture of Los Angeles.
“This is really geared to anybody who has any interest in the local history in Southern California or pop culture,” Gaskill said. “There’s just some wacky, crazy things that, if you didn’t know that they existed, this is the place to come find out about these wonderful little idiosyncratic collections that are all over Southern California.”
The roughly 90 exhibitions covered a variety of topics including sports, music and the different regions of Los Angeles and Orange County. Aimee Lind, a reference librarian for the Getty Research Library, found that one of the greatest benefits of participating in the event was how it helped publicize the collections being exhibited.
“We’ve been in it from the beginning on some level, but just in general it’s to make our Los Angeles collections known to a wider audience,” Lind said. “It’s always nice to see what everybody has and get to know what researchers are interested in and how to better promote our collection.”
Gaskill said the event also aimed to unify the broader USC community.
“I would say it’s along dual tracks. Students are probably about 50 percent of it.” Gaskill said. “But it also reaches out to the larger community. We try to also hit the whole entire professional history community here in Southern California.”
Student volunteer Katherine Brunson, a junior studying mechanical engineering, said that the variety of exhibitions was what made the event so interesting.
“[The bazaar] is really interesting — it has a really wide range of history about Los Angeles,” Brunson said. “There’s a fascinatingly large amount of stuff going on and it’s really cool.”
Susan Berumen, the Orange County archivist whose exhibit focused on the history of the county, also spoke about how the event helped create contacts that could further benefit her archives.
“This is our seventh or eighth year with the archives bazaar, and it’s a great place to meet people,” Berumen said. “We’ve gotten a whole bunch of names and queries, and it’s just a wonderful location and event.”
Doheny Library has hosted the event for the last six years. Because the USC Libraries team responsible for putting on the event is so familiar with the space and since Doheny is situated in the heart of campus, Gaskill said Doheny is the perfect venue to put on the bazaar.
“The whole thing is administered by the Libraries, so we have a team here who knows the building very well, and it’s kind of a natural fit,” Gaskill said. ”Doheny Library is the heart of the University, and so to have this event — which is our premier public event for the year — in the library is pretty special.”
Berumen said the event has previously been very inviting.
“It’s always a positive event,“ Berumen said. “You meet different people every year, and there’s a real camaraderie here.”

USC may not have won the football game against Notre Dame Saturday, but it did beat the Irish for a charitable cause in the annual $10,000 charity challenge for the third time in a row.
In an online scoreboard, USC Credit Union generated 587 credit card applications against the 401 applications of the Notre Dame Federal Credit Union.
USC CU and Notre Dame FCU have committed $5,000 each for the winner-take-all challenge to raise the highest number of credit card applications that started on Sept. 14 and closed Saturday to benefit the charity of their choice, according to Credit Union Times.
Good Neighbors, the chosen beneficiary of USC CU, funds university-community partnerships that aim to positively influence the communities surrounding the University Park and Health Sciences campuses.
Good Neighbors’s campaign supports grants and other nonprofit organizations that promote a safe and healthy environment around USC.
Notre Dame FCU has chosen the Kelly Cares Foundation, cofounded by head coach of the University of Notre Dame Football team Brian Kelly and his wife, Paqui, a breast cancer survivor, to raise breast cancer awareness.
The football rivalry has taken a higher purpose by using this challenge to help the community.
To celebrate the 85-year football rivalry, the two credit unions created the “Tradition Never Graduates” trophy, which will reside in the credit union office of the winning school.
USC Credit Union, founded in 1972, is a nonprofit financial cooperative that provides its members the benefits of better rates and low to no fees for credit cards and loans.

A lot can change in a decade, especially in sports. Ten years ago, an undefeated USC team came to South Bend as the undisputed preeminent program in all of college football. Notre Dame and its coach, Charlie Weis, wanted a victory so badly they resorted to a Belichickian  move of growing the grass to slow down USC’s dynamic athletes. Ultimately, USC prevailed in tremendous fashion with one of the most memorable plays in Trojan history, the Bush Push.
The close loss to USC was lucrative for Weis, who used the 34-31 defeat to ink a contract extension that week. That was the power of USC 10 years ago. The Trojan program was so dominant and widely revered that even a close loss served as a signature victory of sorts. Not everyone may have liked USC, but everyone respected the Trojans. Opposing programs and fan bases got up for USC games. They were the biggest game of the season for every team who faced USC.
Fast forward 10 years, and the state of the USC football program is almost diametrically opposed. I was in South Bend this weekend, and there was no extra emphasis from the Notre Dame fan base because they were playing a great team. Sure, the rivalry created an electric atmosphere, but it didn’t seem like anyone respected or was scared of this USC team.
When Notre Dame won, it was just another victory over a mediocre team. It didn’t mean that much, which is a far cry from what beating USC used to represent. That is how you measure the strength of a football program: how excited opposing fan bases get when they beat you. By that metric, USC is a program in ruins, reduced to an ashen state by a pervasive combination of NCAA bias, poor administrative decisions and abysmal coaching.
Beating USC now doesn’t mean anything because it happens so frequently. The Trojans lose everywhere and to everyone, and it’s both frustrating and dejecting as a fan.
Of course the NCAA played a hand in this with its crippling sanctions. I hate that fraudulent and sham organization as much as anyone, but it isn’t completely responsible for what has happened to the USC program. The depleted roster and reduced recruiting classes that USC had weren’t conducive to a successful program, but USC still brought in enough talent to be in a better position than they are currently.
Let’s not forget that the NCAA punishment might have been diminished or even partially mitigated had the Athletics Department decided to fight the sanctions. Instead, administrators meekly sat there and took it without any fight, much like the Trojans’ defense each week. Combine that with the questionable at best, and horrendous at worst, management of USC’s coaching situation, and a lot of the blame for USC’s current state falls squarely on the shoulders of the Athletics Department.
Finally, the aforementioned coaching has been the key catalyst in the Trojan’s demise. Lane Kiffin seemed more interested in sparring with the media and breaking obscure statistical records than winning games. Forgetting about his off-the-field issues, Steve Sarkisian wasn’t exactly a world beater as head coach. He also seemed to care more about how the Trojans won than the simple act of winning. Poor coaching, an incompetent athletic administration and external variables created a confluence of factors that has ruined the USC brand.
A lot can be written about the loss to Notre Dame. I personally thought Clay Helton did a solid job as coach, and if he wins more this season he should be given fair consideration for the job. The Trojans showed fight and played inspired football. Unfortunately, they also gave up two 90-yard drives in the fourth quarter and senior quarterback Cody Kessler continued his unfortunate trend of disappearing in big moments and big games. The lack of urgency with which he played in the final few minutes was disheartening.
Those are micro issues however, symptoms of a program plagued by macro issues. The Trojans need a leader, a coach who can mold a team in his image and inspire players to compete and bring the Trojan program back. There are coaches out there who can do that — it’s about finding one and not settling for anything less.
The USC program is in tatters. The Trojans are not nationally relevant for anything having to do with actual football —  instead they are a has-been. It’s been seven years since the team played in a Rose Bowl, 10 since they played in a national title. For a University with such immense resources and such fertile recruiting grounds that is unacceptable. Thankfully, the right coach can come in and reverse this trend immediately. With the talent laden roster the Trojans have, the right coach ensures that the next time the Trojans come into South Bend it will be the biggest game of the year for the Fighting Irish. That’s how it ought to be, and that is how it will be for every opposing team when USC finally gets a respectable leader.

No, it couldn’t possibly be Pete Carroll’s lingering disastrous effects on a once-proud program. An internal acceptance of outside questionable influences on the athletes? No way. Cut-throat competition over all other values? Huh? Reggie’s amazing rides, oops…I mean free rides? Preposterous. A GSR among the lowest in D1 college football? That has nothing to down the it. Yeah, right. The problems within the Trojan program are self-inflicted wounds from a leadership culture of an NFL farm club, not a major collegiate program. Full disclosure. I’m an ND grad and have never liked Southern Cal, but had always respected the program up until Pete blew into town, and then ditched it for greener pastures in the NFL. Sorry, the author ought to look inside first at the root causes of the decline. Kudos to the Trojan players for hanging in there in spite of all this muck.
I’m a lifetime ND fan and 2nd generation graduate – so take that for what it’s worth.  But, I don’t agree with how the author portrays the program now.  When the ND fan base looked at the schedule this year, you better believe this was the game that was circled.  The big question we all had was what our record would be heading into the USC game.  Yes, ND made the plays they had to on Saturday, but it was far from the blowout that USC laid on us last year.  At the end of the 3rd quarter, USC was winning the game (and outplaying the Irish).  USC is too strong at recruiting to be down for long.  Fight on, guys.  This game will always be one of the biggest, if not the biggest, game of the year for the Irish.
This is a relatively worthless article that attacks USC and does not address the real issue.  USC is a great power in football.  The coaching is of poor quality and the establishment and the athletic director are not addressing some of the important aspects. USC must change the exercise regiments so that players do not get easily tired by the end of the third quarter.  Most of the games against good teams are lost in the second half towards the end of the third quarter and in the fourth quarter.  This is clearly indicative of the fact that endurance training is not sufficient, and USC should take this aspect very seriously.  Furthermore, USC must employ psychiatrists to build up the players with ability to handle pressure.
I agree with Baug – USC football continues to suffer from bias with NCAA
officials as seen with the penalties USC 10 for 104 yards vs ND 5 for 40
 yards. It was a PAC 12 officials, but there were no ND holding calls for their OL and clearly viewed things from the “blindside” with the Irish defense. We will get through these troubles as a Trojan family.  FIGHT ON !!
You got to move on. What used to be is in the past, and you can’t rest on your laurels. All things in life, whether it be sports, businesses, organizations, etc., go through this. They’re powerful one moment, then they fall. It’s up to them to rebuild themselves, or let the newcomers take over. 
Haden’s mistake was thinking that getting a former coach under Pete Carroll was going to revive the glory years. Nah, that’s not true. If you look at say, boy bands or R & B groups, only one person from there is successful whereas the rest fall by the wayside e.g. Justin Timberlake, In Sync; and Beyonce, Destiny’s Child. Human beings have this tendency to think that being part of something elite rubs off on them (Sark); not true. I knew him and Kiffin were bad hires from the get go. I guess we got to go through our baptism under fire.
Wow, Relax!
I agree USC needs a great coach and nothing less will be acceptable, but calling USC a fallen power is going a little overboard.  Perhaps it was a bit before your time, but there was once a 13 year losing stretch to ND and 8 years losing to ucla.  We got through those years and we will make it through this troubled time.
I for one am proud of how the team played against ND.  They played with intensity and kept it close considering all the distractions of the past week.
FIGHT ON!

Deja vu? · Head coach Mick Haley is hoping that this year’s Women of Troy can replicate his 2003 NCAA champion team that finished 35-0. Maya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Two top-15 teams came to the Galen Center over the weekend hoping for an upset, but it was the No. 1-ranked USC women’s volleyball team that came away unscathed. The Women of Troy earned two conference wins against No. 10 Arizona State and No. 14 Arizona to push their record to a spotless 20-0 on the season and 8-0 in Pac-12 play. USC is one of just two undefeated teams in the country and is off to their second-best start in program history under head coach Mick Haley.
Friday night saw the Arizona State Sun Devils come to Troy for a highly anticipated match up between two of the nation’s best teams. The Sun Devils were undefeated and ranked No. 5 nationally just a week ago, but a trip to the Washington schools resulted in two big losses — to Washington and Washington State — as well as the loss of their star outside hitter, Macey Gardner. With Gardner not in the lineup for the Sun Devils, USC was able to capitalize and pull out the hard-fought 3-1 (25-15, 25-21, 23-25, 25-23) victory.
“We’re glad we got out with a win,” Haley said. “It was a good match for us to stay in and fight, and it was a heck of a way to win.”
Sophomore opposite hitter Brittany Abercrombie had 11 kills and just one error for a .357 hitting percentage, junior libero Taylor Whittingham had 26 digs and senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio had a match-high 24 kills to go along with 11 digs and four aces.
Despite rough patches of play toward the end of the match, Bricio thought her team gained some valuable experience by battling through the adversity.
“I think we’re learning, especially in games like this,” Bricio said. “It’s good that it’s happening now so we know how to get out of these situations in the future, so this was a learning experience for us.”
Whittingham was also happy with the way her team fought throughout the match.
“Every match we learn something different about ourselves, which is a really good thing,” she said. “We’ve learned to battle and stay calm when situations get tight, and when we control what we know we can control, we’re really good.”
The win over ASU was also a milestone victory for USC’s own Mick Haley. The longtime head coach secured his 900th career Division I victory on Friday night, making him just the third active D-I coach to reach the mark.
Sunday’s matinee matchup against the No. 14-ranked Arizona Wildcats was a defensive battle that saw multiple ties and lead changes in front of a loud Galen Center Crowd. Arizona would put up a fight against the Women of Troy, but USC executed when they needed to and pulled out the exciting 3-1 (29-27, 25-22, 26-28, 25-14) win.
Freshman Alyse Ford came up big against the Wildcats with perhaps her best performance in a USC uniform, logging a career-high 19 kills on a scorching .571 hitting percentage. Bricio added 21 kills and three aces, Whittingham had a season-high 27 digs, and Ford’s freshman counterpart Baylee Johnson dished out a career-high 43 assists. Johnson would end the match on a setter dump to secure USC’s 20th straight victory.
USC will now travel up to the Pacific Northwest to take on Oregon State and No. 24 Oregon. USC will take on the Beavers first on Friday night at 8 p.m. before matching up against the Ducks on Sunday at 1 p.m.

The women’s soccer team defeated Oregon 4-0 on the road on Saturday.
The team improved to 5-1 in conference play after dismantling the Ducks. The Women of Troy posted their sixth shutout of the season while scoring a season-high four goals.
Jamie Fink opened the scoring in the 12th minute, giving the Women of Troy an early lead and setting the tone for the match. The veteran forward found the back of the net for the fourth time this season.
Nicole Molen doubled the lead with just minutes remaining in the first half. Scoring on the stroke of halftime can give a team a tremendous boost, which was certainly the case for USC on Saturday.
Molen finished off a corner kick for her second goal of the campaign. Her first goal of the season, which she scored against Oregon State, also came from a corner.
Molen once again proved what an asset she is on set pieces, as she has a knack for finding pockets of space inside the box.
The most dangerous lead in soccer is said to be 2-0, but USC was not about to let this game slip through their hands. The Women of Troy matched their solid first half with an equally impressive performance after the break.
The scoreboard stayed at 2-0 for quite some time in the second half, but with 14 minutes remaining Kayla Mills put the game to bed.
After scoring off of a set piece in the first half, USC took advantage of another dead ball situation late in the second half. Mills curled a free kick around the wall and past Ducks goalkeeper Lauren Holden.
Amanda Rooney added a fourth and final goal with just two minutes remaining, capping off a tremendous road win for USC.
Morgan Andrews was a major asset in the middle for the Women of Troy, logging six shots and two assists on the day. Her chemistry with Nicole Molen and Mandy Freeman continues to grow in what has become a dynamic midfield trio.
The Women of Troy have just four losses on the season but cannot crack the NSCAA top-25 rankings at the moment. USC’s strength of schedule, however, is off the charts.
In fact, the team’s only losses have come in contests against elite opponents Florida State, Duke, North Carolina and Washington.
These four losses must be put into context. The Seminoles are the reigning national champs. UNC is the No. 7 team in the country right now and is the most successful women’s soccer program in history. Duke has fallen out of the top-25 but plays in the grueling ACC along with FSU and UNC.
Washington is currently ranked the No. 18 team in the land and figures to make a major postseason push.
The Women of Troy lost all of those games by just one goal, and the team was on the road for those four matches. This USC team has challenged the best of the best and has looked like a legitimate national title contender in the process.
The team now prepares for upcoming home games against Pac-12 South opponents Utah and Colorado.
USC is riding a wave of momentum as it enters the business end of the season, with Stanford, Cal and UCLA also on the horizon.

Netting it · Freshman driver Nick Lavayen and the USC scoring attack aim to eclipse the 300-goal scoring mark on the season this weekend. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
The No. 2-ranked men’s water polo team notched a pair of victories over the weekend, beating two top-10 opponents in No. 9 Pepperdine at home and No. 6 UC Santa Barbara on the road.
Behind a second half surge and stellar defense, USC defeated No. 9 Pepperdine 8-2 on Saturday at Uytengsu Athletics Center, followed by an intense 6-5 win on Sunday at UCSB.
It was a low-scoring, tight game at halftime, with the Trojans leading 3-2. But the team recorded five unanswered goals in the second half to pull away for the victory.
“We played good defense,” head coach Jovan Vavic said. “We gave up only two goals, but we have to do a better job offensively. [In the first half] we missed way too many shots. We did a good job in the second half putting the ball away and just executing a little bit better.”
The dominant second half started with a power play goal by Lachlan Edwards, who finished in the middle after great ball movement by Nick Bell and Grant Stein. Then, on another 6-on-5, Bell lobbed one to James Walters, who finished to give USC a 5-2 lead.
The Trojans cashed in twice more before the period ended on goals by Bryce Hoerman and Matteo Morelli, extending the advantage to 7-2.
“Our start wasn’t that good,” sophomore Mihajlo Milicevic said. “It was hard in the beginning but after that we calmed down, focused a bit more and played our game.”
Stein applied the finishing touches with a goal early in the fourth period, firing a rocket from the right point for an 8-2 USC lead.
Vavic credited his team’s depth for its ability to distance itself in the second half.
“They got tired, and we wore them down,” Vavic said. “We played more players. Both teams were playing hard. Our depth in the end was the difference maker.”
Defensively, USC held Pepperdine scoreless in the second half and to just two tallies the entire game. Running a full-out press, the Trojans forced 21 turnovers by the Waves and held Pepperdine to just one goal on nine power play opportunities. The strong defense in front of goalkeeper McQuin Baron meant wasn’t tested often, as he had only eight saves in the winning effort.
“We made small adjustments to make sure we executed our plan, especially on defense,” Bell said of the second half changes.
The Trojans recorded the lone goal of the first period at the 6:20 mark when Blake Edwards lofted one over the goalkeeper. It would be the only points on the board until three minutes into the second period when Mark Urban evened it up for Pepperdine.
Twenty-six seconds later, USC regained the lead on Bell’s first goal. Just before halftime, Milicevic found the back of the net on the power play with a hard shot, only to have Pepperdine’s Gavin Scott score 16 seconds later. The flurry of goals made it 3-2 USC at halftime.
On Sunday, the Trojans headed to UC Santa Barbara for a road match against the No. 6-ranked Gauchos and escaped with a narrow 6-5 win. USC fended off a late power play by UCSB, which had the man-up advantage with 45 seconds to play in the fourth period but could not convert.
USC led 3-2 at halftime with two second period goals after trailing 2-1 after one period. The Trojans took a 4-3 lead into the fourth, and back-to-back goals by Edwards gave them a 6-3 advantage and some much-needed breathing room.
Despite closing the lead to just one, the Gauchos were denied in their final bid to even the score.
Sunday’s game was the first of three consecutive road games for the Trojans.
“It’s very interesting to play away, because all those [fans], we can just shut them up, and that’s fun,” Milicevic said.
USC will travel to take on Pacific on Oct. 25 and Cal on Oct. 31.

Go with the Florence · Florence Welch, lead singer of Florence and the Machine, performs a song during a concert at the Hollywood Bowl on Saturday. The band is just coming off of their third album. – Jessica Zhou | Daily Trojan
It’s a real testament to a musical artist if the live performance lives up to the studio album. It’s an even greater mark of genius when the live performance surpasses those recordings. And that’s what happened at Florence and the Machine’s concert Saturday night at the Hollywood Bowl.
The evening started out with an expertly chosen opening act, The Ghost of a Sabre Tooth Tiger. Made up of lead singer Sean Lennon and guitarist Charlotte Kemp Muhl, the music duo performed their hits, “Animals” and “Moth to a Flame” with a psychedelic-rock flair that mirrored that of Tame Impala. The most poignant moment of their set, however, was when Lennon thanked the audience, as he had been waiting his whole life to play at this specific venue. Lennon, the only child of musicians Yoko Ono and John Lennon, played on the same stage his father did more than 50 years ago with The Beatles.
But when lead singer Florence Welch ran barefoot onto the stage, the intensity of the crowd electrified. As she started to belt out the lyrics to “What The Water Gave Me,” the backdrop, a mosaic of metallic, disco-like tiles, fluttered to the beat. Welch set the tone for the night with her boisterous energy, twirling  endlessly on stage to “And oh, poor Atlas / The world’s a beast of a burden / You’ve been holding up for a long time.” The set design also featured industrial lights, which was reminiscent of the famed Los Angeles County Museum of Art piece.
Jessica Zhou | Daily Trojan
After a thrilling opening from  Ceremonials, Welch spotlighted her newest album, How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, with “Ship to Wreck,” during which she gave an introduction to her second night at the Hollywood Bowl. This began her immersive interaction with the audience, such as before “Shake it Out” when Welch explained she originally wanted a gospel choir for accompaniment but decided to employ the vocals of the audience instead. As the audience chanted, “Shake it out, shake it out / Ooh whoa,” Welch collected more energy. She continued to connect with her fans by racing to the middle of the crowd, approximately 15 or 16 rows up, crooning “This is a gift, it comes with a price / Who is the lamb and who is the knife? / Midas is king and he holds me so tight / And turns me to gold in the sunlight,” from “Rabbit Heart.” As the night went on, Welch continued to check in  with the  audience throughout the venue, making it clear how much she cared for each of the almost 18,000 attendees.
Welch also provided personal stories to some of her most beloved songs. She emphasized the significance of the setting as the beginnings of her latest album sprung from a previous performance at the amphitheater, where she also ran into the crowd, way up in the trees. Welch said she saw a crucifix and the Hollywood sign in the distance, and in that moment she was “falling in love with everyone I met.” As she said, “I want to give it back to you; it’s yours,” it cued “How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful.” “Cosmic Love” came with a more humorous backstory — Welch was nursing a hangover that spurred one of the first songs she ever wrote.
Jessica Zhou | Daily Trojan
Obviously, the core of Welch’s magnetism lies in her vocal ability. “You’ve Got the Love,” a cover of the original song by The Source and Candi Station, featured skilled runs and trills. Welch also gave a soulful rendition of “Sweet Nothing,” originally an electronic soundtrack produced by DJ Calvin Harris, which was accompanied by simple instruments and stripped of the electronic frivolousness. Of course, “Dog Days Are Over,” the song that put the band on everyone’s radar, not only highlighted Welch’s sound to carry across the arena, but also her voice control. Right before the renowned chorus, Welch held the audience in suspense, before launching into “Run fast for your mother, fast for your father / Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers,” heightening the overall spirit. This carried on into the encore performances, especially “What Kind of Man,” in which the entire audience started jumping around to the beat of the music.
With that, Welch ran off the stage, still barefoot and spritely. The only complaint was that Welch didn’t perform more songs, including “Seven Devils,” “Over the Love” or “Never Let Me Go.”  However, it was evident that each song had meaning tailored to the people Welch loves the most — her fans.

The much anticipated war drama, Beasts of No Nation, became available to public audiences on Friday, marking a new milestone for Netflix as the streaming media provider’s first feature film production.
Directed by Cary Fukunaga and based on a screenplay of the same name by Uzodinma Iweala, the film is set in an un-specified African nation that has become torn by war and rebel militias. The film’s protagonist, a boy named Agu (Abraham Attah), faces great adversity when rebels invade his village, causing his family to be separated in the chaos that ensues. The film perfectly captures the terror and distress in the many intense ambush sequences upon the innocents and the confusion that results from many different rival factions not being able to distinguish innocents from rebels.
This very case occurs when Agu’s brother and father are killed by the government soldiers believing they are rebels, yet Agu is able to escape into the forest. This leads into the central plot of the movie, where Agu is taken in by a rebel commander, played by Idris Elba, and hurled into the life of a child soldier. The relationship between the commander and Agu, as well as the other soldiers and child soldiers, is a multifaceted puzzle of conflict. While Elba’s character serves Agu and others as a father figure and appears to care for them, he can quickly transform into a ringleader of the boys he dehumanizes into murderous assets, and subjects them to poor conditions and rations. The control that Elba’s character has over the militia is what makes his performance particularly sharp, as he balances both a softer side and aggression, but always with an ulterior motive of self-interest, which makes the commander dangerous and unpredictable.
Attah, on the other hand, delivers a sincere performance that digs into the audience’s sympathy for his struggles and the disarray his life and nation have faced. As tribulations begin to surmount upon each other, his sense of self is further and further removed, and his description of himself as a “beast” in the eyes of others late in the film is especially harrowing considering his stable childhood. Though Agu’s dialogue comes in a large part in the form of voiceovers, the situations he faces are often what shows his greatest character development into the child soldier he once feared, which Fukunaga designs with precision.
That being said, the storyline at times does have a flow that lends itself to ambiguity. Certain scenes and sequences drag on during the 137-minute film, and the pace becomes convoluted in those moments. Nonetheless, the film is incredible in terms of a representation of the strife of war, the emotion involved and, particularly, set and costume design. Most of the child soldiers wear colorful, traditional hats, which are juxtaposed with the fierceness of their rifles and the what they do with them. Sequences with their vibrant costumes rushing out to ambush travelers appear especially striking and eerie, as the audience realizes these are just middle-school aged boys who have been indoctrinated by the commander to commit atrocities. Nevertheless, there are many moments like these which make Beasts striking as a whole, but none that distinguish themselves into specific, particularly memorable moments.
Then again, Fukunaga appears to have created a film that shies away from many cliches that may arise from war dramas set in Africa. Beasts of No Nation remains a film that doesn’t attempt to draw the audience in based on social issues and international issues, but truly on the art of the film and its stellar acting. Though the film may lose points with some for failing to capitalize on certain moments or for not adding to dialogue, it certainly does not stray away from reality, which should be commended.
The film ends with a time of reflection by Agu, and is somewhat reminiscent of stories told by other child soldiers removed from their wartime lives, such as Ishmael Beah’s A Long Way Gone. After leaving a war zone, it is often the most difficult time for soldiers to find themselves again and their expression, and Attah, despite his age, is at his most impressive in these scenes. Beasts of No Nation is remarkably honest, and Elba and Attah elicit standing ovations for their authenticity and mastery of portraying the life of rebel warriors, which is grueling and unfamiliar but shocking and riveting to the audience.

It’s a shame that “Hotline Bling” has yet to top the charts, and it’s garnered a lot of attention for that. The song, most likely an ode to booty calls, was dropped at the end of July during the second show of Drake’s Beats 1 OVO Sound radio show, and since then, it has become a phenomenon.
Drake’s skills as a songwriter are undeniable. He has a creative and clever way of saying something very simple. The track has everything one would expect from a Drake hit — a catchy, well-produced beat and an addictive yet simple hook: “You used to call me on the cellphone.”
In today’s pop world, a song’s success is measured by how many tributes it inspires, and everyone wants a piece of “Hotline Bling.” At this point, artists from Sam Smith and Disclosure to hot new talent Alessia Cara and several YouTube stars have covered the song.
But which one is the Hotline King?
One contender is certainly the amazing Erykah Badu. Earlier this month, Badu took on the song with a seven-and-a-half minute cover and remix version titled, “HOTLINE BLING BUT U CAINT USE MY PHONE MIX.” She tweaked the hook into “You used to call me on my cellular device at night,” and to be honest I completely enjoyed the goofiness. Starting at the three-minute mark, listeners hear a long voicemail with a bunch of humorous options for how to leave a message. “If you’re calling to beg for some sh*t in general, press four,” is my personal favorite. The whole thing is completely over the top, but as an attempt to introduce a note of levity, Badu does her own thing by injecting a dose of weirdness one expect only from her.
Next up is Smith with Disclosure. Smith and the Lawrence brothers teamed up and attempted to bring this song into their world by giving it some dance pep, but unfortunately their efforts aren’t entirely successful. “Hotline Bling” isn’t well suited for the duo’s signature house beats. Don’t get me wrong — Smith and Disclosure need to keep these collaborations coming, because personally, I cannot get enough.
While promoting her new single, “Here,” 19-year-old Alessia Cara is also showing some major love for Drake. Cara is a newcomer making waves, but she’s not new to covers — the singer recently covered Taylor Swift’s “Bad Blood.” Cara owns Swift’s song, making it her own. I saw Cara perform at an iHeart Radio show, and few times has an artist I’ve never heard of before left me wanting more. Cara’s gentle acoustic vocals on “Hotline Bling” are definitely too slow and not appropriate for the club, but they certainly have a time and place.
On the other hand, Keyshia Cole is the Hotline Queen. The singer offers up the female response to “Hotline Bling” that I had been waiting for. In my book, Cole sounds even crisper and cooler than Drake. The lyrical conceit of redirecting the same narrative from the woman’s perspective is fantastic as it reveals that there are two sides to every relationship. I’ve been listening to this remix, and every time I discover a new layer. She sings to Drizzy, you’re “running out of pages in your black book / Chilling with these girls I’ve never seen before.”
Undoubtedly, one of my favorite takes on “Hotline Bling” is a Spanish version by Dominican-American rapper Fuego. One of my friends spends large amounts of time lurking the deepest trenches of SoundCloud, and she knows I love Latin music and reggaeton. When she played Fuego’s “Cuando Suena El Bling,” she claimed it was “better than Drake’s,” and maybe I am completely biased, but the Spanish remix is excellent. The Spanish language rendition took social media by storm and its bachata feel gives it a more genuine emotional feel than the original.
The last contender is Charlie Puth. Kehlani’s presence accompanied by a stripped-down piano arrangement make a soulful duet that is one of the best covers of Drake’s original. It doesn’t take too much of an effort to transform “Hotline Bling,” into a sad cocktail-lounge jam, but the instant Puth and Kehlani’s voices blend as they belt out the chorus is incredible. This particular cover is very humane since we get to listen to both the female and male sides of the story. On Saturday evening, the depressing pop cover played on 102.7 KISS FM, and I wonder if it can become as popular as the original. Puth’s voice has already been featured on two heavy-handed tracks this years — a duet with Meghan Trainor, “Marvin Gaye,” and Wiz Khalifa’s hit “See You Again.”
I am still stupefied at the notion that Drake has never had a No. 1 single on the Billboard chart’s as a lead artist. At this point I could make a proper mixtape of Drake covers, with half its length devoted to “Hotline Bling.” I am thrilled at the prospect of “Hotline Bling,” possibly moving to the top spot in the next weeks.

On Oct. 6, members Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and Alpha Phi sorority organized a “Kanye Western” themed party, where some students dressed in baggy garments, put on cushioned bottoms and even sported a hint of totally racist “blackface.”
While the party is still under investigation by campus officials, Sigma Phi Epsilon and Alpha Phi have had their social activities suspended while their national offices look into the incident.
Dressing up as a celebrity is different than dressing up as a stereotype. And it’s definitely necessary to understand this difference. However, it seemed clear that this party, whether intentional or not, demeaned demographics, a culture and a history of oppressed people. An event like this is absolutely backwards, insensitive and unquestionably a form of cultural appropriation.
One’s cultural background is never an excuse to dress up in a costume and be made a mockery of. The backlash from the controversial party sparked several protests among the UCLA campus. About 200 protesters wore black and marched to Chancellor Gene Block’s office Thursday afternoon, many holding signs with messages such as “Black culture is not a theme,” “Our culture is not a costume” and “Black Bruins Matter.”
As USC students, it’s essential to recognize that this incident was not OK and there are no exceptions to any event that offends a person’s lifestyle or culture. It’s also important that we voice our support toward UCLA students who have felt personally victimized and outraged by the event, this serving as a prime example of what we should rally and stand against.
The “Kanye-Western” party isn’t just an isolated event. Many fraternities, even among the USC campus, have been criticized for questionable events that display some form of cultural appropriation. Last year, Arizona State University suspended the Tau Kappa Epsilon chapter for its offensive “MLK Black Party.” Recently, ASU’s Sun Devils Athletics “asked fans not to paint their faces at any sporting events,” requesting prior to ASU Football’s annual “blackout” game, demonstrating a powerful stance on the issue of cultural appropriation.
Photos of students at the party appeared to show them having a good time with absolutely no remorse for their arguably offensive costumes. It also seems as if mocking cultures has become a normal trend, even among the media and society. Celebrities from Miley Cyrus to Kylie Jenner have been criticized for sporting cornrows and dreadlocks, with backlash coming from Nicki Minaj and Amandla Stenberg.
“If you want to enjoy our culture and our lifestyle,” said Minaj in a New York Times Magazine interview, “bond with us, dance with us, have fun with us, twerk with us, rap with us, then you should also know what affects us, what is bothering us, what we feel is unfair to us. You shouldn’t not want to know that.”
This party could have easily avoided the racist undertones that were present. Minaj makes the valid point that it is okay to embrace this culture as long as one is aware and compassionate of what hardships were and are still present in the black community. If students took this into consideration before getting dressed up for this party, the racism and actions demonstrated could have been prevented.
There is no problem in celebrating one’s culture and the success of artists like Kanye West, but there is a problem when it is parodied to the point that fellow peers feel attacked.
 
Racism still runs freely through the veins of uneducated individuals and affects us all. It’s important to ask ourselves the origins of certain words (ratchet, ghetto, etc..), clothes, hairstyles, etc. Thank you Whitney for this article!
Fuck that. I would have put a pair of box cutters to whitey’s face to cut the charcoal used on their faces off to teach them a lesson they will never forget.
…. and, True …… you would be dead in a few second if you did anything close to that.   Tired of life? We can take care of that!
White students, the message is pretty clear.  Don’t assimilate anything from black or Latino culture into your style, and don’t make fun of any person of color.  Just let them live with their own style choices without any imitation, feedback or commentary.
l_h8_disqus  —   no one gives a rat’s ass about what some black or HISPANIC (btw, there is no such thing as “LATINO” … Latinos died out centuries ago) “culture” ….. these are nothing but SAVAGES  … ugly MFers, too.  So there!
noone wore blackface lmao. also if you actually saw the outfits of people at the party, they were dressed in flannels, yeezy tees, and distressed jeans. more SLP/punk rock kanye than any racial stereotype.
I am not surprised. There is probably racial undertones across the majority of universities in this country. 
Thank GOD there are!

Last Thursday, Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed bill AB 101 advocating ethnic studies in the California school curriculum. Drafted by Assemblyman Luis Alejo, the proposal aimed to promote learning objectives centered on inclusiveness. Though the bill introduces many aspects of education absent from the system so far, more faith should be placed upon the Instructional Quality Committee, an advisory entity of the State Board of Education.
It seems unlikely that Brown would ignore a chance to further diversity, especially in a state where 207 unique languages are spoken and more than a quarter of the population is made up of minorities. And he hasn’t. In a statement addressing Alejo’s proposed legislation, Brown recognized the need for ethnic studies but ultimately deemed AB 101 superfluous due to the current revision of the IQC.
Composed of 11 different committees with hundreds of academic instructors responsible for specific academic areas, the IQC is taking active steps in pursuing a curriculum to better reflect the California student population’s needs. For example, a workshop entitled “Ensuring Equity: Honoring the Cultural and Linguistic Diversity of California’s Children and Youth” is scheduled to be presented this week to teachers throughout the state. An updated, more comprehensive English Language Arts and Development framework is scheduled to be unveiled next year. Additionally, according to its guide to social content, the IQC oversees the accurate portrayal of “cultural and racial diversity of American society; the male and female roles; and the contributions of minority groups, the disabled, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered individuals” in academic texts and environments. And one of their projects aims to instill cultural pride in each child’s heritage. The IQC’s laundry list of contributions to the school system, though flawed and still incomplete, are innumerable.
Furthermore, compared to Alejo’s tactics, the IQC is the most optimal platform to implement reform in the education system. Though school boards in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Pico Rivera are now requiring diversity classes for graduation, these programs have worked on a microcosmic scale. Spearheaded by one force, this diversity-centered course directive is limited and cannot apply to all schools in California. For it to go further, a simpler version must be drafted, which might not be what Alejo originally intended. The IQC, with larger funds and the government’s support, can work to see that courses empowering minorities will be applied in all subject areas.
There’s no denying that California public schools still need to advance in their support of minorities. With an obvious achievement discrepancy, the diversity issue is currently being remedied by the IQC, a body of experienced teachers dedicated to get students excited about learning. In the end, Alejo’s passion is commendable, but if he partnered with the IQC for their expertise and resources, more students would benefit. So, before people jump the gun in expressing their discontent with Brown, let’s wait and see what the IQC has in store.

The past month has been rife with diversity debates here at USC. After our Undergraduate Student Government president’s experience with a racially motivated attack went viral, inciting more students of color to share their experiences on campus, many have proposed systemic changes to greater incorporate diversity into the University, be it through a vice president for diversity or a human rights center. And while the University can — and should — work harder to fund cultural centers and hire faculty of color to promote diversity, we’d be kidding ourselves if we really believed that USC administration could single-handedly solve the problem of the learned and internalized racism that has plagued the willfully colorblind millennial generation.
Gov. Jerry Brown broke new ground earlier this month when he made California the first U.S. state to ban the Native slur “redskins” from public schools’ team mascots statewide. So last week, when Brown vetoed Bill AB 101 mandating ethnic studies — the study of other cultures through differing perspectives — he surprised diversity advocates and echoed an institutional ignorance toward not only today’s insidious manifestation of eurocentrism in education, but also its lack of structural support during K-12 education for students of color.
Eurocentrism during K-12 education has been well-documented and yet it continues to persist. As a 2011 National Education Association review of K-12 textbooks revealed, “Whites continue to receive the most attention and appear in the widest variety of roles, dominating story lines and lists of accomplishments. African Americans, the next most represented racial group, appear in a more limited range of roles and usually receive only a sketchy account historically, being featured mainly in relationship to slavery. Asian Americans and Latinos appear mainly as figures on the landscape with virtually no history or contemporary ethnic experience. Native Americans appear mainly in the past.”
The exclusive portrayal of people of color only as they relate to whiteness devalues the accomplishments of individuals in those subcommunities and continues to reinforce a greater power structure that promotes white achievement at the expense of that of people of color.
As a corollary, the deliberate effort to learn about other types of people that ethnic studies entails provides structural support for students of color to reflect on, and take pride in, their heritage. And giving  white students the opportunity to learn about differing ethnic perspectives allows the next generation to become just a little more tolerant of other kinds of people. Ethnic studies is good for diversity, and it’s good for equity.
Opponents of ethnic studies worry that the class would jeopardize the prominence of STEM education in K-12 curricula. But just as it provides institutional support for students of color to succeed in their careers and academic education, ethnic studies also empowers them to achieve in STEM classes. And it gives white students a framework for productive collaboration with students of color both during K-12 education and for years afterwards.
Brown, however, had a different reason for vetoing the bill. He stated that the Instructional Quality Commission is already revising state standards to include ethnic studies, and thus AB 101 would be redundant. But such an explanation skirts the issue at hand — considering that AB 101 would have required the IQC “to evaluate existing standards, curricula, programs and training regarding ethnic studies at the high school level,” the bill works with the IQC instead of instituting a separate process. Brown’s statement, then, may really be more of a political answer in a state with the second highest nonwhite population, clocking in at 61.5 percent.
At USC, the diversity requirement allows students to explore and understand differing cultures. But two decades of an education that leaves out communities of color cannot be righted in one University class. It’s time for the effort for a more holistic education to pervade past the halls of higher education and into those of California high schools. Diversity, after all, comes from the ground up.

Sonali Seth calls for classes on ethnic studies. OK. Which ethnicities? Only blacks and Latinos? Not Greeks, Chinese, Poles, Russians, Samoans, Portugese, Eskimo Jews, etc.? These are all diverse ethnic types and not all European, either. Do they rate being part of the class that Seth advocates? No? Why not?
