For artists and music lovers alike, virtual concerts during the pandemic have become a haven to escape from the stressors of daily life. On Oct. 28, Living Records Mini Sessions hosted a concert at Flow House for artists to debut their new or upcoming music. These performers include USC artists Ashes to Amber, FUN SUCKR and Ella Collier, as well as Los Angeles-based musicians Iz LaMarr and David Kaiser.
The first of the five to perform was Iz LaMarr, an L.A.-based singer, rapper and producer. He has released a few singles in the past few months such as “Lightbulb,” “Westside” and “BLOW.” At the virtual concert, he performed songs from his upcoming EP, “Mapped to Stardom.” 
In it, his songs “Target,” “Bag,” “AF1” and “Tag” all have upbeat rhythms that compliment his high energy and rapping style. His songs talk about his aspirations and what he hopes to accomplish. For upcoming artists, he advises them not to wait around for things to happen and to “really make sure that you are the one in control.” 
Softening down from that high energy, Kane Acosta, a senior majoring in music industry who goes by Ashes to Amber, performed some slower beats while playing an electric guitar. In July, Acosta released his EP, “Miss Future,” as a way to help people stay happy during these times, and on Oct. 30, he released a song he didn’t perform, “1976 Horror Movie Chick” as a way to expand the genres he creates music in. 
Acosta played two unreleased songs for the concert, “Do Not Pick The Flowers” and “Going Down,” which are more sentimental and melancholic than his previously released music. The songs feel similar to the vibes of Joji’s music. 
Following Ashes to Amber, FUN SUCKR, a female pop band, matched the easy-going vibe. The duo includes Zoe D’Andrea, a junior majoring in popular music, and Samatha Short, a senior majoring in theatre and narrative studies. A couple years ago, D’Andrea and Short were in a musical theatre class, passing notes on band idea names, and that’s how the band came into being. 
“I feel like we really hit momentum after we released [‘Can’t Keep Me Away’], so we have definitely changed and grown a lot since then,” D’Andrea said. 
At the beginning of the quarantine, the two went home and took a break from writing music for a few months. Since they came back together, they have been writing a bunch of new songs they said they hope to release soon. For the concert, they performed “Pretty,” “Giving Love” and “Fun Suckr.” The last song is a tribute to Halloween fanatics who will be celebrating the holiday at home this year. 
After them, David Kaiser took the stage with heartfelt songs about the pressure society at large is under right now. Even in their ambiguity, his songs reflect his worry about society’s apathy for other people. 
“I think that there is a lack of compassion right now,” Kaiser said. “I don’t think that hatred is the opposite of love or compassion or empathy. I think apathy is … [when] you don’t recognize emotions in other people, you don’t recognize that’s an important thing.”
Kaiser’s song “Just Like That” expresses this idea and the confusion with society using abstract sounds and other voice-over clips to create multiple levels within the song. His raps are mixed with strong vocals to impart a feeling of tension on the listener. Kaiser also performed two songs he hopes to release before Nov. 4: “Stonehenge” and “Durrington Walls.”
“I think the path to healing has to do with compassion over apathy,” Kaiser said. “Because we all have to figure out how to heal, the journey is from apathy to empathy … Love realizes that there is no other, there is only us.”
The closing performer for the night was Ella Collier, a junior majoring in popular music performance who has been releasing music since she was 12 years old. With the release of her new single “cinderella,” which came out Oct. 30, Collier feels that her new music is “authentically me.” 
For the concert, she sang “cinderella,” “Like That” and a cover of UPSAHL’s “MoneynMyMind.” Throughout her whole acoustic performance, she showcased her strong vocals against the sounds of the piano and guitar.
Flow House’s cozy vibe gave the entire hour-long concert a personal touch. Each artist brought their unique voice to their performances, and I look forward to what they put out in the future. All the proceeds from this concert went to Suitcase Joe Foundation, which is working to fight poverty in the L.A. area.

Even though Halloween is right around the corner — and much more unusual than normal — not all is lost! Here are some great ways to spend Allhallows Eve while still being comfortable at home!  
Virtual Concerts
Looking for music other than the “Monster Mash” to complete your Halloween? Then a virtual concert is the way to go! Reggaeton singer J Balvin is having a virtual Fortnite concert this Halloween where users can watch on the new island featured on Fortnite. Rolling Loud will also have a virtual concert via Twitch on Friday and Saturday called “Loud Stream,” featuring headliners Gunna and Trippie Redd! And if you want to be the star of your own concert, USC is hosting a virtual Halloween karaoke night Saturday, so bring your costumes and your best singing voice!
Virtual Halloween Party 
Though Halloween parties will look a lot different this year, it doesn’t mean fun with friends is out the door. Having a virtual Halloween party over Zoom will still give you the opportunity to celebrate! There are themed games you can play such as horror movie trivia or murder mystery. 
Missing haunted houses? Take a virtual tour of eerie places like the Winchester House or The Paris Catacombs, or for a free experience, take a walk through these haunted houses! 
Drive Through Haunted Houses
Miss getting scared while walking through a haunted house? Well, there are still chances to feel that terror safely, and from the comfort of your own car, with drive-through haunted houses! If the Upside Down has always been a place on your bucket list, there is a drive-into “Stranger Things” experience in Los Angeles that feels straight out of Hawkins itself. For all-around horror, The Los Angeles Haunted Hayride is still alive and well in drive-up form. Tickets for the “Stranger Things” experience and Haunted Hayride are available on their respective websites.
Carve Pumpkins
Other than candy, what is Halloween without pumpkins? Whether it’s decorating your front lawn or roasting pumpkin seeds, pumpkin carving can be a fun way to get into the spooky spirit. Tired of the same jack-o’-lantern carving? Why not choose this year’s NBA champions with a Los Angeles Lakers pumpkin! Or channel your inner crewmate with an AmongUs pumpkin. If carving isn’t your forte, there are many other ways to decorate a pumpkin, such as painting it!
Movie Marathon
From horror films to comedies, there’s a Halloween movie out there for everyone. There’s a wide range of Halloween movies, so why not watch them all this year! For those who would rather laugh than scream there are movies such as “Hubie Halloween” or “The Addams Family.” 
For Horror fans, “The Invisible Man” and “Us” are great picks. For those who just want to enjoy themselves, “Hocus Pocus” or “The Nightmare Before Christmas” are perfect choices. TeleParty, an app that allows you and your friends to stream a show or movie at the same time across different locations, is a great way to enjoy your Halloween movie marathon!
Dress Up in a Costume
Costumes are a staple of Halloween, and while many won’t trick or treat this year, dressing up is still a great way to stay in the Halloween mood. You can take some dope pictures for social media or even host a virtual costume contest! There’s also still time to break out last year’s costume too, and if that’s not an option, last minute Halloween costumes are always a great way to go (I see your cat costume!).
Make some Halloween treats
For those who have a craving for treats (and hopefully not brains) this year, making some spooky treats is a great way to spend Halloween night. With all the candy still available at the supermarket, try out Halloween candy bark. People who enjoy the quick and simple route, ghost smores dip is a must-have. For the Halloween haters who wish it was Christmas already, maybe a haunted gingerbread house is right up your alley!

The 2020 presidential election is unlike any we have seen before — amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the national reckoning over systems of oppression, including racial inequities, police brutality, disparities in health care and economic opportunity, there is much at stake on Nov. 3. Over the past four years, President Donald Trump has divided the citizenry, corrupted democracy, condoned propagators of hate, stolen children from their parents, aligned himself with hostile foreign powers and failed to adequately protect the country from a virus that has since claimed more lives than any other nation and continues to run rampant. The Daily Trojan Editorial Board, for these reasons and many more, officially endorses Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. 
The endorsement of a Biden-Sen. Kamala Harris ticket is a call to restore the dignity of the presidency. Beyond the flurry of constant conspiracy theories and racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, colonialist and dangerously misguided anti-science rhetoric and tweets, the current administration has soiled the very notion of what acceptable and ethical leadership ought to look like. A Biden administration affirms that elected leadership cannot, and should not, use hate and fear-mongering to push sectarian buttons.
Setting the character and integrity of a Trump administration aside, the choice we make on Tuesday will invariably affect our future and redefine the political landscape of this country. Given the recent confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, securing a 6-3 conservative majority, and our Republican-majority Senate, it is imperative that we push back now and instill hope in the citizenry that meaningful change can and will occur . There are many reasons to support a Biden-Harris ticket over a Trump-Vice President Mike Pence one — here, we’ll touch on just a few.
It is not an exaggeration by any stretch that the sitting president has failed to adequately manage the coronavirus pandemic. Trump has ignored and contradicted top health experts, suggested that masks are ineffective and pushed states to reopen quickly at the cost of more than 200,000 lives. A Biden administration, on the other hand, would allow scientists to spearhead the national pandemic response. He is a proponent of mask-wearing and has promised to expand contact tracing and at-home testing. 
There is no reason to believe a second-term Trump presidency would do anything differently than the first, and giving them the benefit of the doubt on that matter alone could mean the difference between a robust national response to the virus or thousands more lives lost. 
On that note, our access to health care is also on the ballot, perhaps now more than ever. For the last four years, the GOP has been aiming to repeal the Affordable Care Act with little success. Now, with a majority-conservative Supreme Court, Republicans are conspicuously seeking to overturn the ACA and Roe v. Wade.
Biden, on the other hand, has promised to defend the ACA from legal and congressional challenges and expand its coverage to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, recipients. Health care is a human right, as is a person’s right to choose in the realm of reproduction. It is essential we have a leader for health care justice and reproductive rights in the White House.
It goes without saying that disparities in health care disproportionately affect communities of color and marginalized groups —  Black and brown Americans get sick and die from the coronavirus at rates higher than white people and higher than their share of the general population. We live in a country where people have to fret for their livelihoods due to the color of their skin and Trump exacerbates this  problem. 
He has failed to condemn white supremacist groups, made countless racist remarks toward Latinx immigrants, banned entry of individuals from majority-Muslim countries and repeatedly called the coronavirus “the Chinese virus.” The sitting president has continued to exemplify his willful negligence in shaping a country that is accepting of all individuals, not just white men. 
Currently, Biden’s plan to address racial disparities include protecting and constructing affordable housing, allocating $30 billion to minority-owned businesses, securing the rights of workers of color to fair compensation and making public universities and historically Black colleges and universities free for families whose annual incomes are less than $125,000. This, among other legislation addressing disparities in infrastructure, poses a stark contrast to the incumbent President, who does not and would not have any concrete plans to address systemic racism and inequality in the United States
Trump’s two — yes, only two — main priorities in addressing racial disparities consist of keeping unemployment rates down and supporting minority-owned businesses. These objectives are based solely on economic gain; they decisively fail to address the roots that allow systems of oppression to blossom and impale marginalized communities on their thorns. 
The harm at the hands of the police system and lack of accountability are a reality that has haunted the United States and the world. With the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery igniting the continuation of the Black Lives Matter movement this summer, race relations between police and Black community members have been once again cast into the spotlight. Although neither Biden nor Trump seem to fully grasp the extent of corruption and racial violence that is embedded in the police system, the differences between how these two candidates feel about police brutality are clear. 
Trump, for one, has continually labeled BLM protestors as thugs and criminals. He sent the National Guard to attack peaceful protestors, tweeting threats such as “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Trump has denied that the use of the police force or policing system in general is in need of any changes and instead assumes the support of police while dismissing and trivializing the death of Black lives. 
In contrast, Biden has explicitly laid out ways to reform policing through more comprehensive training and a number of other reforms. Although these initiatives are by no means sufficient to address the deep racialization and corruption of the police system, the alternative is to live in Trump’s complacency and blissful denial.
There is also an existential threat on the ballot. Under the Trump administration, much of the environmental protections put in place by the Obama administration have been reviewed and rolled back. In his first year in office, Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement, a multinational collaborative effort to combat climate change.  Trump has raised his own doubts about global warming, retorting “I don’t think science knows, actually,” when asked if climate change contributed to the September record-breaking wildfires in California.  
Conversely, Biden’s Plan for a Clean Energy Revolution and Environmental Justice relies on the Green New Deal as a framework for one of the most progressive climate plans ever proposed in U.S. history. Biden and Harris have pledged to work toward a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, investing in infrastructure and clean energy improvements to prevent and withstand climate change. The proposed plan emphasizes environmental justice, taking action against polluters and industries who are disproportionately harming vulnerable communities. 
For some, particularly unsatisfied progressives, a temptation not to vote might prevail on Election Day. However, for those who are discouraged — perhaps Biden was not your first, second or even third choice — it is essential to keep one thing in mind: Biden’s platform, despite not reaching the progressive heights set out by Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, is still the most progressive platform of any Democratic nominee in the party’s modern history.
This is not some contrived attempt to make Biden, a 77-year-old white man, suddenly palatable to young progressives;  it is simply the truth. Even Waleed Shahid, communications director for Justice Democrats, the same group that worked to get Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar elected, said as much in a recent interview with Vox. Americans cannot let their notions of the perfect candidate be an obstacle to the groundbreaking good that a Biden administration could bring about.
Coming from a primary election cycle marked by historic progressivism, Biden has also demonstrated an ability to learn from his colleagues and shift his own policies in a progressive direction. He has adopted plans from his chief primary rivals — progressive Sanders and Warren. From Sanders, he has pledged to make public colleges and universities free (to those with family incomes below $125,000); from consumer protection expert Warren, he has adopted her bankruptcy reform plan, which would allow student debt relief in bankruptcy. This diametrically opposes him to our sitting president, who shuns compromise and progress.
It cannot be overstated that Tuesday’s vote will be a defining moment in U.S. history. To the Daily Trojan Editorial Board, the choice is clear: The Trump administration epitomizes everything that is backwards, indecent and shameful about our nation’s past and present. A Biden presidency represents an opportunity to rebuild, reform and look toward a better future.Though the Daily Trojan Editorial Board officially endorses the Biden-Harris ticket and calls on all those who can vote to do so, we also feel any presidential endorsement is incomplete without an explicit mention of the voter suppression occurring across the nation. We acknowledge that the democratic process is, in many ways, broken and that it will not be fixed without substantive systemic reform and activism beyond voting. That being said, we still believe it is necessary to support Biden’s nomination to the fullest degree.

Ahead of the Nov. 3 election, the Daily Trojan Editorial Board has compiled a list of the state measures, constitutional amendments and some of the candidates for state officers that Californians will be voting on. Here are our recommendations for how voters should cast their ballots on Tuesday.
Proposition 14: YES
Funding for State Stem Cell Research
Touting possible cures for diseases from Parkinson’s to paralysis, Californians in 2004 opted to fill the federal void in research funding by borrowing $3 billion to create California’s own stem cell agency (to the dismay of anti-abortion advocates, who likened stem cell research to abortion). Now, that money is drying up. Without a fresh infusion, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine will cease to exist. The institute’s stem cell research has led to clinical trials, biotech jobs and research toward treatments or cures for ailments affecting half of Californian families.
Proposition 15: YES 
Undo Limits on Commercial Property Taxes
Under the current law, if a corporation purchased, for example, a commercial property worth $15 million in 1985 and the property is now worth $95 million, the corporation would still pay property taxes based on the property’s original value. This is an enormous tax break to some of the largest businesses in California, and they should be taxed based on their current, fair market value instead of their purchase price. By ending this tax break, $6.5 million to $11.5 billion can be raised to better fund schools and local services, helping the state and hard-hit communities to effectively rebuild themselves  after the coronavirus pandemic.
Proposition 16: YES 
Restore Affirmative Action
In 1996, Proposition 209 banned the use of affirmative action in California. In the wake of this year’s national reckoning on racial inequities and the coronavirus pandemic, Californians must recognize the urgency of combating systemic and structural racism in our state by passing this measure. We must promote educational and economic diversity and help address widening disparities and setbacks for Black and Latinx Californians.
Proposition 17: YES 
Voting Rights Restoration for Persons on Parole 
Currently, the California Constitution prohibits felons from voting until their parole or prison sentences are completed. The current statute does not function to serve any legitimate governmental interest — rather, the statute stands to further disenfranchise already marginalized members of our society. Restoration of voting rights enables a person to reenter society with dignity by giving them control over their civil rights.
Proposition 18: YES 
Primary Voting for 17-Year-Olds 
This amendment would allow 17-year-olds who will be 18 at the next general election to vote in primary and special elections for California. Eighteen states and Washington D.C. currently have such legislation in place. The ballot measure received bipartisan support in the California legislature and provides young people with the opportunity to amplify their voices and participate in civic engagement. Young people are underrepresented in electoral processes but are still affected by the decisions made by elected officials.
Proposition 19: NO 
Property Tax Transfers
This measure allows eligible members to transfer their original tax assessments to any property within a state, with an upward adjustment on expensive properties, as opposed to only to homes of equal or lesser value. Extending these tax breaks so far out would ultimately hurt the average taxpayer who does not benefit from the measure. It is mostly realtors who stand to gain in the form of added commission. Moreover, it would unnecessarily add a crushing tax burden to children inheriting properties.
Proposition 20: NO 
Criminal Sentencing, Parole and DNA Collection Initiative 
Proposition 20 calls for a series of amendments that further perpetuate California’s mass incarceration rate: It would raise the classification of misdemeanors (theft-related crime) to a wobbler, increase sentencing penalties, require people who committed misdemeanors such as shoplifting, drug possession and prostitution to submit their DNA to the state and federal databases and classify more crimes as violent so fewer convicts are eligible for parole. Most, if not all, of these amendments use taxpayer dollars to keep people in jail for petty crimes and cut funding for mental health, school, housing, homelessness and public safety programs. 
Proposition 21: YES 
Rent Control 
Endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders and the California Democratic Party, Proposition 21 would allow California cities to limit rent increases if a property is more than 15 years old. Property owners who own no more than two housing units, such as condos or single-family homes, will be exempt from rent control. Dubbed the “Rent Affordability Act,” Proposition 21 would help lower-income and working class families avoid being evicted due to skyrocketing rent prices. 
Proposition 22: NO
App-based drivers as independent contractors
Proposition 22 is the most expensive ballot measure in U.S. history. It is written and financed by Uber, Lyft, Doordash and Instacart to deny basic protections — a minimum wage, paid sick leave, safety protections — to workers. We have labor laws for a reason and app-based driving should not be allowed a special exemption. Do not allow big corporations to buy new laws for themselves — vote NO on Proposition 22.
Proposition 23: NO
Kidney Dialysis Clinic Rules
The proposition, which would place more requirements on dialysis clinics such as mandating the presence of one licensed physician at clinics while patients are being treated, reporting data on dialysis-related infections to state and federal health departments and obtaining consent from the state health department before closing a clinic, is unnecessary. There is little substantive evidence that the proposition would protect the health and safety of dialysis patients. At its core, this proposition appears to be a union ploy to pressure clinics and organize dialysis workers.
Proposition 24: YES 
Data Protection
This is a data privacy measure that would restrict businesses from being able to harvest various forms of users’ data without permissions on behalf of users. Moreover, it would establish a new state agency, The Privacy Protection Agency, to enforce the proposition. The importance of data protection for users and the need to restrict the power of unelected tech giants cannot be understated in the age of technology. 
Proposition 25: YES
End Cash Bail
Cash bail is a classist structure that keeps lower-income and working class individuals in jail as they await their trial; this is inherently unfair as those with generational wealth are in a position to easily absorb the cost. Proposition 25 would replace cash bail with a risk assessment that gauges whether the person is a flight risk and/or a threat to public safety. 
L.A. County District Attorney 
Daily Trojan Endorses George Gascón 
Incumbent Jackie Lacey has served as L.A. district attorney for two terms and is widely regarded as a punishment-first prosecutor. A majority of her backing has come from the law enforcement community, and she has been the recipient of critique most recently due to her failure to reform the law enforcement system in the city and hold officers accountable for use of unwarranted, deadly force. Under her leadership, Los Angeles has led the United States in law enforcement-related shooting deaths. Meanwhile, her competitor George Gascón, a former San Francisco District Attorney and assistant chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, is leading the path toward progressive prosecution. Gascón is a Cuban refugee and military and law enforcement veteran. Favoring mental health treatment for incarcerated persons, the elimination of cash bail and ensurance of resolution parity for undocumented members of the community, Gascón is the clear choice for those looking to ameliorate the broken criminal justice system in Los Angeles. The Daily Trojan Editorial Board joins Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sens. Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Eric Garcetti in endorsing George Gascón.

Despite the significant decline in positive coronavirus cases among students, USC Student Health expects an increase in cases following Halloween. In anticipation of the upcoming week, which includes Halloween, the election and the Nov. 7 USC home football game, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman urged in student media briefings and in her community health update email Oct. 26 that students remain vigilant when adhering to coronavirus-related guidelines.
Van Orman confirmed in a student media briefing Thursday that during the week of Oct. 18-24, five students tested positive through exposed and symptomatic testing administered by Student Health. This marks a slight increase in cases from the previous week, which saw only one positive case in students, according to Student Health testing data. 
“We don’t know if this is a trend yet, but … as you start to see numbers in L.A. start to creep up, it’s only going to take a slight bit of mixing in our student population [to cause] a slight uptick of cases,” Van Orman said. “We could very easily be in an outbreak situation in another two to three weeks right before finals and the holidays.”
Both weeks saw no new cases for asymptomatic student surveillance testing administered by external testing distributor Color, according to testing data. Van Orman said that Student Health has seen fewer positive cases but more students getting tested, which they want to continue through the end of the fall semester. 
According to Student Health’s COVID-19 dashboard that featured tier assessment data from Oct. 26, there are approximately eight new cases per 100,000 people in Los Angeles County, amassing a 3.7% positivity rate. Thus, the county still remains within the most restrictive tier for the state. As for potential reopening plans for the spring semester, Van Orman confirmed that Student Health will reach a final decision based on local public health conditions with the L.A. Department of Public Health in late November.  
In her Oct. 26 email, Van Orman cautioned against any parties or large gatherings especially during Halloween and the Nov. 7 game, as they are prohibited by both public health order and University policy. Tailgating and other kinds of gatherings are prohibited on campus properties, including USC Village, with Van Orman encouraging virtual watch parties instead.
According to the email, the L.A. County Department of Public Health now allows limited private gatherings with three or fewer households — with the exception of dormitories, residence halls, boarding houses, group living situations, fraternities and sororities.
“There’s going to be a normal want to … get together socially, so we’re really continuing asking students to be vigilant on that and to remember that those things are still not safe and not permitted,” Van Orman said in a student media briefing Oct. 22. “And it would be very easy for us to have a very significant uptick again. We want to keep those numbers low.”
Since symptoms can appear as late as two to three weeks after a coronavirus infection, Van Orman said Student Health could see a surge of cases in late November if students continue to attend gatherings. This could impact students preparing for finals, as well as pose risks when they go home for the holiday break. 
“Many of you may have heard Dr. [Anthony] Fauci speaking, but he’s been speaking about Thanksgiving and universities actually being superspreader events,” Van Orman said. “So if we imagine thousands of students, even at USC, traveling home over the holidays, if the rate of infection and the cases are high when people travel home, it’s really potentially very deadly to their families, to the communities they’re traveling.”
For Halloween, Department of Public Safety Assistant Chief David Carlisle said in an interview with the Daily Trojan that DPS plans to continue cooperating with students and housing management companies in limiting the spread of the coronavirus. According to Carlisle, Halloween normally sees a large number of parties, and especially because it falls on a Saturday this year, he stressed that students must remember that large parties are prohibited and that they must keep each other safe.
During the fall semester, Carlisle said that DPS has responded to well over 200 party-related calls — a number that is not atypical of a fall semester. Most of these party calls involved smaller social gatherings that did not necessarily involve coronavirus-related violations, Carlisle said.
“It’s not 200-plus complaints of COVID violations,” Carlisle said. “There’s many houses in the University Park neighborhood where you have multiple students living together, and so they can’t help but come in contact with each other at least to some degree. But if their music is playing, and it sounds like a party, then it’s in our system as a party call, and we would go and respond and ask for their cooperation.”
According to Carlisle, when DPS responds to a party call, they will try to identify the person hosting the gathering and record their information, as well as document who is attending if possible. If gatherings at a particular location, such as an apartment complex off-campus, become an ongoing problem, DPS contacts the corresponding management company for additional cooperation. 
At this point in the semester, Carlisle said DPS has been “fairly successful” in responding to gatherings and limiting the spread of coronavirus infection.
“[The number of party calls] is slowing due to people understanding that there are risks involved, and so working together with Student Affairs and other University departments and DPS to convey the message that it’s all about staying safe and healthy, we see the number of party calls slowing,” Carlisle said. “I hope that continues on Halloween.”
According to Van Orman, when cases increase in young adults, hospitalization and death rates begin to follow over the next several weeks, which is what L.A. County has recorded. Therefore, looking ahead to the upcoming week, Van Orman stressed that students continue to take coronavirus precautions seriously to prevent any potential outbreaks.
“We are in a way asking students to think of others, to think that you actually are a part of a public health solution, that your actions … directly will affect the number of people who might end up hospitalized or passing away from this virus in our county, and that feels very distant,” Van Orman said. “But it actually matters … I just can’t stress that enough.”

In previous in-person semesters, the USC community was able to celebrate LGBTQ+ History Month by attending open mic nights at Ground Zero and even taking in the various banners dedicated to the month hanging on Trousdale Parkway. 
However, this semester, USC and the LGBTQ+ Student Center have continued to celebrate LGBTQ+ history month — a month dedicated to celebrating the historic achievements of the LGBTQ+ movement in the United States — in a completely virtual setting.
To accommodate the new environment, this year’s events include virtual guest speakers, a creative writing workshop to share LGBTQ+ stories, the observation of  Intersex Awareness Day and more. The month also includes collaborations with cultural organizations including the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment  and the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly on the intersection of different social identities.
Michael Oliveira, an archivist at the USC ONE Archives, the largest repository of LGBTQ+ materials in the world, said LGBTQ+ History Month is about sharing the narrative of the people within the community. 
“It’s about raising awareness, creating allies, creating understanding. The LGBTQ movement has been tremendously successful because it has used many of the same tactics that the anti-war movement, the African American civil rights movement, the women’s movement … in order to advance equality,”  Oliveira said. “We hope that people look at this and see that the movement is very much part of their life.” 
Steven Vargas, a graduate student studying specialized journalism and former executive director of Queer and Ally Student Assembly, who has been actively involved in the LGBTQ+ Student Center since his freshman year, said that learning from the history of the movement is important for present members of the LGBTQ+ community. As a queer person of color, Vargas said he recognized the importance of establishing a safe space for his identity.
“I think that History Month is important in highlighting how we got here because this current generation [of LGBTQ+ individuals] lives their current identity a lot differently than the past generation,” Vargas said. “I think acknowledging how we got to this moment in time where we have a better sense of safety while expressing our queer identity is important.”
Christina Belcher, a professor at the USC Writing Program and the department of Gender and Sexuality Studies, hosted Coming Out Narrative: A Creative Non-Fiction Craft Workshop, a writing workshop for participants to write about their LGBTQ+ identity and coming out story in the context of their own unique social and cultural background. The event also provided writing prompts to participants, who were encouraged to later share their stories. 
“I think that [participants] really give us insight into the nature of homophobia, religion, looking for community, looking for acceptance, and that can be both really difficult but also really liberatory and something to be celebrated,” Belcher said. 
For Anna Randall, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies and the co-chair of USC QuASA Pride Fest, celebrating LGBTQ+ History Month has played a major part in her time with the movement since she came out in 2015. 
“I think LGBTQ+ History Month is really important to recognize and bring awareness to because that is how queer identities become accepted and [it’s] how we create allies,” Randall said.
Despite being conducted in a virtual setting, Randall said the responses among students to LGBTQ+ History Month have increased with more student engagement, even from those who do not identify as LGBTQ+.
“I think being virtual has actually really helped students access resources, because it can be difficult to find resources on campus if you don’t really know where you’re supposed to be looking,” Randall said. “I feel like even our meetings and being social have also benefited from being online because it gives people the ability to do it from the safety of a private room.” 
Although USC’s LGBTQ+ History Month has provided students a safe space to express themselves, Vargas said he believes that USC still has room for improvement. 
“USC has taken some efforts in acknowledging the need for equity and inclusivity within its campus, but I don’t know if it’s really taking the efforts to do so,” Vargas said. “For example, they’ll put out a statement, but what does that statement do? What do these forums really do without actually putting in the effort into even the smallest things within classrooms and within different social spaces?” 
With the upcoming election and political climate, Randall said she believes LGBTQ+ History Month has a larger role now more than ever. 
“There’s a lot of political conflict, and unfortunately, queer identities are, apparently, a “topic for debate” in politics, which is really unfortunate considering that these are people’s lives. You can’t help your identity. You can’t help your gender identity or your sexuality, it’s a part of who you are,” Randall said. “It’s important to educate people who do not know much about the [LGBTQ+] community and what we’ve fought for and what we’re still struggling with today in terms of acceptance and allyship.”

Despite the production delay due to the pandemic, season 22 of “Big Brother,” a reality TV show where 16 strangers move into a house and have no outside contact with the rest of the world for around 100 days to compete for half a million dollars, aired on CBS this summer. With an absent live audience, racially charged motives and insensitive comments from cast members, BB22 was one of the most dull seasons yet.
Initially, fans were ecstatic to welcome back previous houseguests for this second All-Stars season. Fan favorites Janelle Pierzina, Kaysar Ridha and Keesha Smith were among the returnees from previous seasons, but unfortunately, their time in the house was cut shorter than fans hoped for.
Cody Calafiore –– who placed second in BB16 –– won one of the first competitions of the summer, setting the tone for the rest of the season. Immediately, Calafiore’s alliance ran the house, evicting players out the door. Week after week, it became increasingly evident that BB22 would be one of the most controversial and predictable seasons ever.
At least one person of color was predictably nominated for eviction every week, similar to previous seasons where houseguests of color were often targeted first. David Alexander was the last contestant of color left until his eventual eviction placed him eighth. White players, including Calafiore and Tyler Crispen, had stronger competitive streaks as seen by both their respective seasons, but they did not touch the chopping block until after all the houseguests of color were evicted. Viewers questioned if this pattern was motivated by strategy or another factor.
Though CBS did not broadcast many of this season’s controversies, they were revealed through the 24-hour live feeds. Live feeds showed Christmas Abbott saying “I’m going to get shot” after nominating Bayleigh Dayton and Da’Vonne Rogers  –– two Black women –– for eviction. Some viewers speculate Abbott did not make her comment with malicious intent, but her use of microaggressions understandably raised concerns.
That same week, Abbott sparked a heated argument with her nominees. Dayton and Rogers voiced how if they, as Black women, had approached their conversation with Abbott, a white woman, in the same manner as Abbott had, they would be branded as “ghetto ass Black.” After CBS aired this altercation, fans were appalled by Abbott. Still, Dayton was evicted that week and Abbott placed fourth.
Numerous houseguests have also been condemned for mocking Ian Terry, who has publicly discussed his autism. The BB14 champion explained that rocking on the backyard hammock helps soothe his anxiety. Live feeds caught a conversation between Dani Briones, Nicole Franzel and Memphis Garrett when the latter described Terry as the house’s “redrum,” referring to the horror movie “The Shining.” 
Despite the disappointment that was this season, BB22 made history. Not only was it the first season made during a pandemic, but Alexander was the first Black man to make it to the jury –– the last nine evicted players who decide the winner –– since BB11. This season executed the American show’s first Triple Eviction, commonly seen in the Canadian franchise, where three people were evicted in one night.
BB22 also facilitated many important conversations. Rogers and Alexander communicated their reasons for coming back to the show: to raise awareness through the platform for the Black Lives Matter movement. Rogers’ emotional eviction speech demanding justice for Breonna Taylor and Black lives was heartbreaking and necessary on a show that has historically avoided exposing racial tensions in the house. Ridha conversed with Dayton about the murder of George Floyd, and Kevin Campbell also discussed his desire to positively represent the LGBTQ+ and bi-racial communities.
Nonetheless, BB22 was extremely underwhelming. BB is known for its unconventional twists that change up the course of the game each season, but the show’s motto, “Expect the unexpected,” rang false this season. Many decisions were based on group consensus, in contrast to the cutthroat, individualistic component of the game seen in older seasons. As Campbell said in his post-eviction interview, houseguests were “afraid of sticking out and making moves.”
The season finally started ramping up at the end with the final, three-part “Head of Household” competition. Franzel won the first part Oct. 23; Calafiore won the second Oct. 25. They went head to head in the third part on finale night Oct. 28.
Calafiore beat the BB18 winner and claimed the final HOH, leaving Franzel and Enzo Palumbo vulnerable for eviction. This season saw its first and only blindside as Calafiore evicted Franzel, bringing Palumbo to the Final Two. Franzel and viewers were shocked because Calafiore and Franzel had a Final Two deal since the beginning of the season and had remained close friends since their time together in season 16.
Ultimately, Calafiore took home the prize in a unanimous 9-0 vote, becoming one of two contestants to win and place second in two separate seasons. Both feats have only ever been accomplished by Dan Gheesling.
Palumbo was far from winning but earned $50,000 as runner-up. Rogers deservedly won the last prize of the night, America’s Favorite Player, making history as the first Black houseguest to win the $25,000 prize.
BB22, while shortened to 85 days, felt dragged out. From fan favorites being evicted first to houseguests’ distasteful actions, this second All-Stars season did not meet the level of excitement and gameplay displayed in the first. Regardless, Calafiore proved himself worthy of the win this summer. He balanced a decent social game with an extensive streak of eight competition wins and was never nominated for eviction. Though he will never be on the same level as Gheesling, Calafiore is a well-rounded player and will remain valued in BB history.

While we may all agree that the world is shit, on average, we disagree vastly on why that is. We need to know the undeniably nuanced truth about how we got here so that we can start to fix stuff, but that can’t happen if we all disagree on the origins of these problems. Enter Borat. 
Disclaimer: I do not intend to imply that Borat alone will save the world (though this is my privately held belief). Instead, I argue that Sacha Baron Cohen’s latest work is a decent case study that provides insight on how comedy can be one of our last epistemiological weapons in the war against truth. 
First, let’s contextualize the current war on truth. Where we used to disagree on the implications of certain facts, we now disagree on the facts themselves. Pew Research Center published an interesting finding on this in April: “Republicans trust Fox News more than any other outlet. Democrats distrust it more than any other outlet.” To trust a news source is to believe that its reporting is factual and accurate, but if two sides of the country are so diametrically opposed on what is factual and accurate, there is a giant disagreement on what the actual truth is in the United States. To reiterate perhaps the coldest take of 2020: people are increasingly cherry-picking which facts count as facts to confirm their pre-existing beliefs. 
By contrast, we cannot cherry-pick which jokes to laugh at. Laughter is an involuntary 
physiological response by nature. While we can perhaps be primed to laugh or sometimes suppress our laughs, in general, when we are presented with funny material, we distort our faces, contract our muscles and chuckle, snort or giggle. 
While the answer to the question “What is funny?” varies from person to person, there are competing theories on why one might find something funny at all. The incongruity theory posits that comedy emerges from a violation of our expectations. The traditional set-up-to-punchline joke format elucidates this idea well: The former sets up the expectation for the audience, the latter violates it and if it is performed sufficiently, laughter erupts. From this perspective, then, laughter can be seen as an admission that something has transgressed our notion of reality. So, if we are all forced by our own physiology to laugh at something, we are all equally forced to agree that it at least lacks a resemblance to what we’d expect. This is the exclusive revelatory power that comedy has. 
This is not to say that comedy is inherently the great unifier. The cherry-picking problem does not evaporate entirely with regard to comedic material. People can choose which comics or writers they feel are dishonest or partisan in their craft and subsequently ignore them, just like they do with news sources. The difference is that there is more personal incentive to seek out funny comedy rather than strictly biased comedy — and that incentive is laughter. 
Borat addresses this cherry-picking problem by dealing with real people in real time. Baron-Cohen is not the sole architect of all his jokes; he coaxes real, unsuspecting people to generate comedic effect. 
Most notably in the recently released sequel to his original (2006) film, “Borat,” there is a scene starring Rudy Giuliani, former New York City mayor and now President Trump’s personal lawyer. In the scene following what he believed was an interview for TV, (spoiler alert) Guiliani is lying in a hotel bedroom, his hands suggestively placed in his pants, with the interviewer nearby. This might be presumptive, but no one can help but laugh at how insane that is! Moreover, say what you will about Baron Cohen’s political bias, but no amount of partisan motivation could have forced Guiliani into such an unsightly position. It becomes very difficult to conjure up some accusation of bias to discredit his work.
By laughing at Borat, we’re all admitting that it violates what we feel reality should look like. We admit that we don’t think a man of Guiliani’s status should be behaving this way, we don’t agree that people should join in on songs about chopping up those who disagree with us, we don’t feel it is justifiable to sell gas tanks to kill Roma people. And the big joke of it all is that all of this stuff is actually real! Borat is showing us certain uncomfortable facts in a fashion that is hard to dispute, no matter who you are, and forcing us to acknowledge them as problems. All this is accomplished by presenting us with these facts in a way that makes us laugh. 
We find a rare shining light of optimism deep inside of Borat and it is, as he would say, very nice. What we see is that laughter has an exclusive ability to force individuals to acknowledge certain objective truths all on their own, even in a time when people bend over backward to avoid doing so. I’ll end with one of my favorite quotes of all time (that I may use as a consolation prize once the election results are in):  “Let me make the songs of a nation and I care not who makes its laws.” Sing Borat sing!

When presidential candidate Bernie Sanders suspended his campaign in the 2020 Democratic primary back in April, an exasperated sigh could be heard throughout the left-leaning electorate across the nation. 
For many, Sanders’ signature policy proposals and fervent dedication to low-income and working class individuals represented a much-needed shift toward socialist values in United States politics. However, once it became evident that the less galvanizing and more moderate former Vice President Joe Biden would likely take Sanders’ place, running against President Donald Trump in the general election, rhetoric quickly shifted from a socialist revolution to settling for the “lesser of two evils.”
Graphics circulating throughout social media pointed out a list of striking similarities between the two supposed presidential nominees, referring to Biden as “just Trump in blue.” Frustrated by their lack of choice, some began to question the significance of electoral politics as a whole, resolving that if they were unable to vote for someone they actually believed in, it was better not to vote at all. 
This disheartening yet familiar position is often referred to as the product of bipartisan politics. Compared to other economically-developed democracies such as the United Kingdom or France, the United States’ political landscape seems to be far scarcer. Although voters can register in the American Independent, Green, Libertarian and Peace and Freedom parties, there is a commonly held and statistically-supported belief that votes outside of the established Democratic or Republican parties don’t really count in elections. Coupling this with the highly conservative political homogeneity displayed in the 2020 presidential race, many people don’t see a viable way to communicate their views and have them be reflected through the current system of electoral politics. 
Part of the reason why this center-right ideological monopoly has held true in the United States has much to do with the religious origins of this nation. As you may recall from a grade school history lesson, the first European colonizers to settle on the rightfully-Indigenous land of Turtle Island (now commonly known as the United States) were Puritan Protestants fleeing Europe after the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century. Departing from the Anglican Church of England in favor of the religious freedom to practice greater piety, spiritual purity and adherence to the ideals of the Protestant reformers, many seperatist Puritans sought to create a “spiritually pure utopia” in The New World. 
In 1776, 150 years after the first colonizers founded the Plymouth colony, 75% of Americans were Protestants. Nearly 400 years later, 2014 statistics reflect that 71% of Americans identify as broadly Christian and nearly half of Americans still identify as Protestant. This religious affiliation demonstrates an aberration in American politics wherein the United States’ political landscape remains comparatively religious-conservative even as its economically-developed democratic peers have become increasingly secular-liberal. This is a result of a phenomenon referred to by scholars as cultural inertia, meaning that “the earliest communities of an emerging society exert a disproportionate influence on the culture’s fundamental nature.”
However, what makes the United States a particularly interesting case study in cultural inertia is the fact that parallel to its persistent conservative and religious adherence, the United States has also become widely known and criticized for its markedly hedonistic culture and hyperconsumerism. Although few American Protestants identify themselves as specifically Puritan, the beliefs and values of this particular sect of Protestantism have had an indelible influence on American culture and politics due, in part, to a concept called implicit social cognition.
While an individual might not credit their conservative or moderate beliefs to a Protestant upbringing, simply being socialized within U.S. society tends to impart Protestant values such as individualistic meritocracy and an association between work and divine salvation. This may lead not only to the endorsement of conservative positions on politically-defined moral issues but also to an absolutist view of the very nature of morality. Distinct from moral relativism and a hallmark of Puritanism, moral absolutism is defined as “belief that there are absolutely clear guidelines about what is good and evil. These always apply to everyone, whatever the circumstances.” This is part of the reason why issues like abortion and the death penalty are so polarized within U.S. politics; moral absolutism could also be the cause behind the United States imprisoning more people than any other country in the world. 
While college-educated Americans are known to display more publicly liberal views than their non-college-educated peers, purportedly rejecting moral absolutist or socially unacceptable conservative ideals on topics such as homosexuality or promiscuity, studies have shown that they implicitly endorse these same conservative views due to something called “hedonic ambivalence” — or  “tension between their implicit and explicit moral beliefs,”
These conservative views ultimately play out in the arena of U.S. politics. Because of the majority-rules, winner-take-all electoral system instituted in the United States, rather than being proportional to the voter base, political representatives reflect only the largest share of voters — which, in the case of the United Statesis moderate or conservative. Many political scientists oppose this method of electoral politics because of its tendency to obscure and suppress non-dominant political views. Instead, they favor proportional systems such as a party list or alternative vote system, which are widely used by other economically-developed democracies. 
Under our current system, congressional and local elections go to the candidate who gets the largest percentage of votes. Whereas in presidential elections, the candidate who wins a total of 270 electoral votes, regardless of whether they have the popular vote, wins. However, if the United States implemented a party list system and, say, 50% of votes for Congress were Democratic, 25% were Republican, 10% were Green Party and 15% were Peace and Freedom in a given election, those would be the percentages of politicians from each party represented in Congress. This way, minor political parties could still get a voice and elected officials would actually reflect the bodies of constituents they represent. 
Today, our nation’s 116th Congress is 78% white, 75.8% male and 88.2% Christian; this description sounds a lot more like an antiquated picture of the Framers than a present-day image of the burgeoning diversity of the United States. 
Until we can come up with new electoral processes that ensure everyone’s voice is heard, the United States is doomed to remain stuck in the 1700s, repeating the same unrepresentative center-right elections that we’re seeing in 2020, for centuries to come.

Alright, here’s the deal. Songwriters deserve more credit. 
The craft of songwriting is much like writing a beautiful poem but with words woven together by melodies and euphonic vocals, sounds of percussion and instruments as the backdrop. As a songwriter, you envision what you want your song’s message to be, line by line, what words you want to rhyme and how they’ll all flow together in harmony. It’s often the most challenging part of creating the song — deciding how vulnerable you want to be with the lyrics and how much of the story you want to tell or withhold from the listener. 
Songwriting is a method of storytelling. A songwriter can send the listener into another world — just like directors do with their films, authors do with their novels and singers do with their voices. 
But the decline of the solo singer-songwriter is on the rise as each year; more of pop music’s greatest hits are written by someone other than the voice singing it or rather a team of writers. The most recent song to hit No. 1 written by one songwriter was Ed Sheeran’s “Perfect” in 2017.
However, another way of looking at the decline of the solo singer-songwriter in present-day music is by examining the collaborative nature of music and the creative process. Sometimes the producer has a suggestion for the artist — change a word here, flip the phrase there, say it like this instead of this — but does the collaboration of people writing the lyrics behind a song make the artist singing it suddenly ingenuine? 
I wouldn’t say so. With the steady increase in the collaborative approach to songwriting and, at the same time, the growing demand for artists to always be releasing something new, the role of collaboration can sometimes be beneficial — at least when the artists’ voice and vision are also being considered. 
Rarely is music today written solely by one person. Record labels and management teams bring together writers and artists to get ideas flowing for music in a smaller window of time. As a result, collaboration has seen steady growth in the last decade. 
However, some prominent figures in the music industry worry that the declining trend of the solo songwriter will dilute the vision the artist has for themselves and their music. 
Look at the songwriting credits on any of today’s biggest hits — there are multiple writers attached to them. Fans adore authenticity, but can an artist still be authentic when they collaborate with multiple songwriters? I think there’s a way to collaborate without the artist’s distinctiveness being drowned out. 
Let’s take Ariana Grande’s latest single “Positions,” which came out Oct. 23, for example. Hop on Spotify or do a quick Google search, and you’ll quickly discover that there are eight writers attached to this song — Grande, Angelina Barrett,  Brian Vincent Bates, James Jarvis, London Tyler Holmes, Nija Chaeles, Steven Franks and Tommy Brown. Big surprise? 
Like Grande, many pop singers collaborate with multiple songwriters, but their identity as an artist isn’t always lost by doing so. Yes, there may be influence on the product of the song once it’s completed, but songs with multiple collaborators likely won’t ignore the artist’s stylistic choices and what they are trying to achieve in their music. 
If a song does, however, change the image of the artist, it’s typically on purpose — as we see with artists such as David Bowie, Prince and Lady Gaga — who embrace being a chameleon of their craft and morphing genres and styles with each of their albums or “eras.”
Before 2000, the majority of hit songs were written by a solo songwriter. As examples, Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Michael Jackson, Prince and Stevie Wonder all single-handedly wrote some of their No. 1 hit songs.
Although I appreciate knowing that the artist I’m listening to wrote their own lyrics, I don’t suddenly dismiss all of the music that has been made behind the scenes by songwriters. 
It’s important to understand that behind the artist delivering the message, there’s someone who created it, and though that someone may not always be the singer, their artistry is just as important. For some songwriters, it’s a huge compliment to have an artist sing the song they wrote. It can also be an honor that the song gets heard by a larger audience due to the singer’s caliber, notoriety and fanbase.
But does it then decline the artist’s authenticity if they didn’t write the song their listeners are praising them for creating? Should we no longer respect them as an artist if they’re singing someone else’s story?
While I don’t think it declines the authenticity behind the messages the singer is trying to relay to listeners, I do believe the writers behind their hit songs should be given more respect and acknowledgment for their work. 
I don’t think we should look down on artists who don’t write their own songs, but giving recognition to the writers who do write them would be a wonderful thing.
Often, when I connect with an artist’s music it’s because I hear something in it that lyrically resonates with me. I think the role of songwriters within the music industry should be recognized not only by the artists themselves, but also by the listeners.
Hardly any popular artists today write their music solely on their own. But all of this isn’t meant to dismiss the plenty of artists who do solely write their own music, all I’m saying is that secret songwriters who do some of the background writing behind popular hits shouldn’t remain such a secret.Emily Sagen is a senior writing about music’s lasting impact.

Well, I said it in the first column and here we are: Another scandal has found its way to the USC campus. Maybe I predicted it — but can something really be predicted when history almost guarantees it?
I’m talking about USC sophomore wide receiver Munir McClain’s suspension from the team amid an FBI investigation into an unemployment claim he made this summer. But, the scandal is not the fact that he filed — from the look of things, he properly filed for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits for his sneaker reselling service. USC is at fault for not presuming McClain innocent until proven guilty. 
The Los Angeles Times focused on the Office of Professionalism and Ethics’ role in its investigation. The fact that USC has to have an independent workforce to handle complaints and possible legal issues is a whole other story, but the supposed benefit of such a task force is its ability to give students and student-athletes “procedural protections” to resume their respective roles at USC while under investigation. 
McClain has been completely shut out of these procedural rights. His mother, Shanrika “Shan” McClain, claims neither the University nor any of the coaching staff has offered a complete explanation as to what qualified her son for suspension. 
It’s been over a month since the McClain family has gotten any updates. With Munir’s brother, redshirt sophomore linebacker Abdul-Malik McClain, still on the roster heading into the first game day, the McClain family is now torn between fighting for one son’s proper due process and another’s opportunity to compete. 
The McClains deserve the presumption of innocence on behalf of both USC and the Department of Labor-Office of Inspector General. McClain may very well qualify for benefits from the Employment Development Department of California as a full-time student and owner of a sneaker reselling business. The Department of Labor clarified its qualifications for students in April to include those who work part-time, and a misfiling would ultimately be the state office’s error in not reviewing correctly — not the young man looking for income in his own right. 
McClain’s filing reflects the void the NCAA threw its players into when the pandemic shuttered its operations. While government unemployment assistance is outside of NCAA jurisdiction, the association does heavily monitor and restrict the types of employment athletes can pursue. At the end of the day, even a minimum wage job can prove a headache for both the student-athlete and employer who must regularly confirm they are not benefiting directly from their student-athlete status. 
In an unsteady job market, that type of applicant isn’t appealing, and in the middle of a pandemic hitting the average American with terrifying financial uncertainty, McClain took advantage of the relief the association refuses to give to the thousands of athletes who need it. Many student-athletes are struggling to make ends meet during a pandemic, and the NCAA refusing to even bend the rules in extraordinary circumstances is telling of its indifference to those student-athletes.
Shame on USC for not having the guts to stick up for one of its own or giving McClain the bare minimum of a transparent due process before suspension. Our University should have the spine to back its students for capitalizing on available resources in a stability-shattering pandemic. 
So yeah, a USC scandal was guaranteed. 
But USC football throwing one of its own players under the bus for clean hands PR? That wasn’t even on the betting board.

As the USC Trojans inch closer to a football season like no other, it’s make or break time for head coach Clay Helton’s team as news of coronavirus outbreaks across rosters and coaching staff has canceled at least 29 games across the country thus far. 
Before practice on Wednesday, Helton taped an ESPN article to the locker room wall announcing Wisconsin’s cancellation of its upcoming Saturday game against Nebraska because of a team tally of 12 new positive coronavirus cases.
Helton implored the team to follow testing protocol, wear masks and think of the opportunity that a six-game season can bring for their game development and athleticism. 
“It’s kind of like time has stood still, and you don’t get that too rarely in life,” Helton said in a press conference Thursday. “And what I mean by that is this year is an unbelievable opportunity to go compete for a championship, play with your teammates, play with your brothers — and not one person’s eligibility [is lost]. They’re just getting great development and great education.”
In August, the NCAA Board of Governors approved a fall-sport-wide retention of eligibility due to the pandemic, regardless of whether conferences decide to hold a season. The retention exclusively applies to this year and gives teams the ability to test their depth, which is especially advantageous for a Trojan team with a small drop-off in skill from veterans to freshmen players. 
On the offensive line, coordinators Graham Harrell and Tim Drevno have several players making rounds in one to two positions each, with freshmen offensive linemen Courtland Ford and redshirt Jason Rodriguez at right guard, freshmen Jonah Monheim and Caadyn Stephen at right tackle and freshman Andres Dewerk and redshirt sophomore Liam Douglass at left guard — all praised for having productive camps and the right mindsets to step up when needed.
Helton reiterated that narrowing down the Trojans’ defensive front will probably be the most difficult decision that he and defensive coordinator Todd Orlando make in the days leading up to the conference kick-off against Arizona State. Fans should expect several players to get some playing time, as Helton said that newcomers like freshman defensive lineman Tuli Tuipulotu are “hard to keep off the field.”
Adding to the depth is a new health update, with several players returning to practice in different stages of individual, group and full-pad drills. 
Showing up and showing out the past few days are freshman wide receiver Joshua Jackson Jr., who is back from an ankle injury, and junior inside linebacker Kana’i Mauga and sophomore outside linebacker Drake Jackson. 
Past-season tailback standouts redshirt sophomore Markese Stepp, treading carefully after a new and minor mid-foot sprain, and redshirt -senior Vavae Malepeai are getting back into some contact plays and individual drills, respectively. Additionally, after changing up personal game plans and independent work, the team hopes to see freshman wide receiver Gary Bryant Jr. back in time for the Nov. 7 game. 
With depth, the absence of a spring camp and half the typical regular season schedule, Helton is looking to recover from past mistakes by staying physical each week, while balancing the health and safety of his players. 
“It’s a great advantage because — and we actually talked about it as a staff yesterday just out of coincidence about the ability in this early season, don’t be afraid to use guys, and be able to use our depth — whether that’s offense, defense or special teams,” Helton said. “Because in this scenario it’s a little bit different, I mean you can look up and three guys test positive or false-positive and the next guy’s out there.”
This week, the first mock game-week, figures to be the start of that pattern, full of practices that would normally compose a week in between matchups. On Saturday, the team will have a final run-though in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum with “Fight On” blasting and simulated fan sounds bringing players as close to the real thing as possible. 
After the mock game, Sunday won’t provide the Trojans any time to rest, as practices are shifted up so that Tuesday, Election Day, can be an off-day for players to vote.

Starting college amid a pandemic, Sophia Pelaez found it hard to connect with students online and have the same sense of community at USC that she would have had in person before she joined Troy Philippines.
Pelaez, a freshman majoring in journalism, first joined Troy Philippines to connect with others who shared the same cultural background and, despite the usual disconnection that comes with being online, said she was immediately overwhelmed with a sense of belonging when joining.
“Even though everything is online, I still feel comfortable on a Zoom call, like I felt more comfortable on a Zoom call with Pilipino club than I have in person with people I’ve known for longer,” Pelaez said. “I just think the sense of community and the upbeat energy of that club overcomes the barrier of awkward Zoom silence.”
Troy Philippines, the University’s only Pilipinx club, serves to create a safe, cultural space that promotes personal growth and cultural celebration, even for students who do not identify as Pilipinx.
Although this year presents the obstacle of members not being physically present, Troy Phi President Richelle Caday said she aims to uphold the same sense of community for new members as in years past.
“This year it’s always been my goal to recreate those spaces where people do feel like they are a community, recreate these spaces where people are able to see that family spirit or feel like they’re close to one another,” said Caday, a senior majoring in nongovernmental organizations and social change and psychology.
One way Troy Phi has made sure to involve new members is with Kuya Ate Ading, a big-little program that matches returning members with new members to create a family.
Organized by programming director Elianna Bautista, a sophomore majoring in occupational therapy, this year’s Kuya Ate Ading matching took the shape of Tinder-like profiles based on interest forms instead of the typical in-person social events Troy Phi would usually host.
“[For] a lot of our bigs, I encouraged [them] to send care packages beforehand so that their littles could open it during that day of reveals,” Bautista said. “Some people sent Postmates and things like that. So cute things that usually happen during reveals, I tried to implement online.” 
For new members such as Pelaez, the big-little program has fostered new friendships and opened up the opportunity for members to make deeper connections.
“Even though I just met [my big], and I think this speaks to the entire environment of the club, she is just so welcoming and friendly, and she genuinely has felt like she wants to get to know me,” Pelaez said. “The big-little program has just been so fun and so fulfilling. It’s an awesome way to get to know new people and feel like I’m a part of something.”
But Troy Phi is much more than just a social club. It also looks to both educate on and celebrate the Pilipinx culture. Weekly meetings take on different subjects such as wellness workshops and discussions on identity.
A staple series of meetings for Troy Phi is during Pilipinx American History Month in October. Events during this month bring in a multitude of speakers and activities for students to learn about past and current events in Pilipinx culture, with this year’s online format spearheaded by co-community and culture chairs Anthony Manliguez and Gabbie Santos.
“The mission of [the community and culture chairs] this year for me and Gabbie was centered around what we call ‘island connectivity,’” Manliguez said. “We want to educate our members on the Philippines as a whole and as a country comprised of a myriad of islands, not just one collective whole.”
After growing up in both the Philippines and the United States, Santos, a sophomore majoring in psychology and law, history and culture, wanted other members to have the same cultural awareness and appreciation that she received with this year’s PAHM series.
“I realized that I kind of treasured my experience and wanted to help other people because there’s lots of Pilipinos here who didn’t have that experience [of growing up in the Philippines],” Santos said. “I want them to have the opportunity to do the same or learn about the Philippines in a way they wish they could.”
Kicking off the five-week PAHM series, former  “The Voice” contestant Jej Vinson spoke on his experience and identity as a Pilipinx American immigrant. Following events included a discussion on Pilipinx representation by acapella group Filharmonic and professional NFL cheerleader Bianca Brooks, a dive into Pilipinx mythology of gods and goddesses and an exploration of Pilipinx languages with Kristian Kabuay, a calligraphy artist specializing in endangered Pilipinx writing systems. PAHM wraps up Thursday with actress Asia Jackson in a discussion of colorism and identity.
While this year’s PAHM series was not able to include events such as its usual Pilipino food feast, the online format opened up new kinds of opportunities. Manliguez, a sophomore majoring in linguistics and cognitive science, said that being online had its advantages — for instance, speakers were more accessible as they were able to call in from anywhere in the country. Celebrating PAHM over Zoom has also helped foster even more friendships with randomized breakout rooms.
“I think one of the beauties of breakout rooms is that they’re randomized, so you get to meet all these people from the organization. Whereas in person, we can stick with the people you know and circle up to them,” Manliguez said. “It’s one of my favorite things to see friendships blossom from breakout rooms and it’s one of the things that was so unexpected.”
With a growth in membership to about 150 students, Troy Phi has served in educating more students this year, coupled with strong family-like connections. Caday hopes to continue growing the Troy Phi community in both quantity and quality by constantly welcoming new members and advocating for the greater Pilipino community.
“Definitely the motto of Troy Philippines is ‘For the culture, for the love,’” Caday said. “We’re here for the love, for the love for each other, for the love for the club, for the love for our culture, like how that’s something that we really emphasize on and just being a community for folks.”
