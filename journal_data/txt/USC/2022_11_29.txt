If you’ve ever felt the need to write a thirst tweet similar to “Shawn Mendes can stomp on my body,” just know that it’s not as fun as it sounds — as much as we’d all like to get lost in his Japan. From attending Conquest and Springfest, there’s a phenomenon that has recently (violently) pushed its way into my life: moshing. 
So, what is moshing? I’ve been stepped on a few times recently — none of the occasions consensual, unfortunately — but moshing isn’t just about the death sentence or falling in the middle of a concert. 
“In my experience, [moshing] is a bunch of people colliding with each other,” said Landon White, a sophomore majoring in intelligence and cyber operations who often partakes in moshing. “It could just be jumping up and down, or pushing each other. Or, it could be literally beating each other.”
Out of our very own Orange County, moshing originated in the late ’70s. Taking from styles of dancing such as pogoing, jumping up and down with your arms against the sides, the expression is said to have been coined by East Coast punk rockers Bad Brains. In their song “Leaving Babylon,” the word “mash” was misheard due to the singer’s Jamaican accent, prompting crowds to understand the phrase as “mosh.”
At USC, it’s hard to find an event where some students aren’t taking advantage of the opportunity to slam their body parts into disinclined individuals. The practice, while common, can create an atmosphere that has led to numerous injuries and creates unwelcoming settings for those with less mobility. In 2017, Springfest was canceled during Migos’ set due to overcrowding. At the 2019 Welcome Back Concert, Samuel Sommerer, a senior majoring in computer science, found himself between a rock and a hard… body?
“The concert was going fine until the point Westside Boogie got on stage. I was standing in the middle [of the crowd] with a couple of my friends, and at one point he said, ‘Oh, if you don’t want to get hurt, get out of the crowd now.’ I was an idiot and I didn’t get out of the crowd. And then he split the crowd like Moses, you know how he split the Red Sea, right? He directed everyone to go into two halves, and then when the beat dropped, he told everyone to crash together and everyone ran into each other,” said Sommerer. 
Boogie’s irresponsibility as a performer had a direct effect on the safety of the students who were at the event. “Obviously a lot of people started falling down on each other. I heard people screaming. There’s a girl crying next to me. Three to five people fell on top of my left leg, and I thought it was going to snap for a second,” Sommerer said. “So, I started keeping my arms out to maintain a distance around me … and I had a preexisting injury, and someone bumped into my arm the wrong way and my arm dislocated.”
Even before events such as the Warped Tour rock festival banned moshing in 2014, there has been a history of prevention tactics that have been used to discourage rowdy rockers. One of these tactics is to set expectations with the performers themselves, a method used by the USC Concerts Committee. 
“USC will go so far as to not okay performers on campus who would encourage moshing,” said Alexis Farahi, the committee’s risk management director of the committee. “We have even had instances where they’ve tried to do the thing where they say, ‘I know that you usually encourage moshing, but if you incite that, then we’re gonna have to cut off your show.’”
However, let’s not make any quick judgments on this form of expression; jumping to conclusions isn’t nearly as fun as jumping on top of each other. White argues catharsis as a major appeal of moshing. 
“Mosh pits started with metal and hard rock culture and live performances of that music, which oftentimes deals with bouts of anger and isolation, stuff like that. It’s the opposite of isolation. It’s a bringing together of people in a literal sense,” he said.  
Maybe there’s something very human about only necessitating a cluster of bodies to indulge in a bit of joyful ruckus.
In the vast, diverse network of mosh-enjoyers, there are rules that are followed to ensure maximum pleasure from all parties. Here are three Au-fficial rules to surviving the frights and fights of nightlife: 
Rule #1
If you’re at a close-contact party, it may be wise to keep your hype closer to a pogo-style. Acting as a human torpedo isn’t attractive when you’re trying to get some. Torpedoing is for after you’ve wowed your crush, not the method. 
Rule #2
When someone falls near you at the club, it doesn’t mean they are automatically part of the dancefloor. Trampling is only hot when it’s consensual.
Rule #3
Treat others the way you’d like to be treated! Before you decide to channel your inner wildebeest and attack your fellow crowd mates, consider the Golden Rule.
Moshing, an integral part of modern nightlife, doesn’t have to be dangerous. For everyone who is involved to be able to experience the euphoric feelings of a communal rapture, it’s crucial to follow these rules. And the next time you’re at a USC-sanctioned event, consider all these things before jumping in and jumping on the opportunity.

On the corner of 4th Street and Broadway, Brian Sullivan and his husband spent Friday night at Precinct, a popular gay bar in Downtown Los Angeles. It was their first night out since news of the monkeypox virus broke in the queer community. 
Drawn in by familiar strobe lights pulsing to the DJ’s ‘80s disco mix, Sullivan weaved through tipsy strangers and barely audible conversations to the dance floor. He spent the last few weekends, Sullivan said, trying to find monkeypox vaccines for him and his husband. 
“The local government is nowhere to be seen,” Sullivan, a USC alum and 30-year resident of South Central L.A., said. “My husband and I finally got our vaccines through Redline, another gay bar on 6th.”
At Precinct, once you’ve paid the $9 cover fee, you can also receive the monkeypox vaccine, either by appointment or walk-in, with a side of gin and tonic and front-row seat to “Fat Slut,” the bar’s newest drag show.
In a grassroots campaign to expand monkeypox resources between South L.A. and DTLA, the L.A. queer community has transformed night clubs like Precinct into one of the ways residents can access their two-dose vaccinations against the virus. 
“Once again, the gay community is coming together and being there for ourselves. Where are we going to get a vaccine? Precinct, Redline, [The] Abbey,” Sullivan said. “We’re looking after our own when the government is slow to respond.” 
L.A. County currently has the highest number of monkeypox cases in the state, and it reported the country’s first monkeypox death back in September, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of the county’s 2,364 total monkeypox cases reported as of Nov. 9, 96% are male residents and 76% are gay, lesbian or bisexual, according to the L.A. County Department of Public Health. 
“One of the first reasons I wanted to get the monkeypox vaccine was because I knew L.A. goes crazy. I knew there’s going to be parties and they’re going to [have] super close contact,” said Sachin Dubey, a junior majoring in public policy. “[If] it’s ‘fuck following the COVID protocols,’ then the monkeypox protocols are not going to be followed at all.”
Dubey received their first dose of the monkeypox vaccine in Chicago at the University of Illinois Chicago, where they worked a public sector job before coming back to USC. 
Dubey’s search for a second dose of the vaccine, however, has been even more of a challenge now that they are back at USC. Unlike UIC, USC does not offer monkeypox testing or vaccinations for students or residents, with the exception of a USC School of Pharmacy clinic at Dodger Stadium in Elysian Park, according to the USC monkeypox information website. 
The website refers students and staff to guidance about the virus from the CDC and LAC DPH, adding that “eligible residents can walk up to receive the monkeypox vaccine at [LAC DPH] vaccination points of dispensing (PODs)” in an August 26 update. 
Dubey said UIC, a public university, may have had early access to the monkeypox vaccine due to its access to government funding, and that USC may not have had a similar opportunity yet.  
“But, it’s also very strange to see how stringent they were about COVID [precautions] last fall and spring,” they said, “and it literally went from a 100 to zero. There’s no effort being put into monkeypox prevention.”
To reach more eligible queer residents, clinics with federal supplies of the JYNNEOS monkeypox vaccine are partnering with queer bars, nonprofits and event organizers. St. John’s Wells Child and Family Center, a South L.A.-based network of medical clinics, partnered with gay bar Redline DTLA to distribute hundreds of second-dose monkeypox vaccines, according to a Sept. 8 press release. 
Simon Kilner, the bartender at Precinct, said he received the second dose of his vaccine at the bar, whose vaccination site is run by Studio City-based Elements Pharmacy. Kilner’s  experience getting the first dose, which he received at an L.A. County site, was drastically different from his follow-up shot at Precinct, he said. 
“I waited in line for three and a half hours, and I frantically had to lie and cheat my way into getting the vaccine,” said Kilner. “The second time I got it at Precinct, I got it in five minutes.”
Kilner said he did not find out about the vaccine until some of his queer friends contracted the virus. He said witnessing his friends deal with monkeypox compelled him to search for a vaccine. 
“It was gay men themselves finding out about it and doing what they could to make [vaccines] happen,” Kilner said. “It looked so painful and awful. I think that drove a lot of gay men to get the monkeypox vaccine.”
To veterans of queer nightlife like Sullivan, gay bars have been historical sanctuaries for the LGBTQ community. This network of mutual care, he said, is rooted in the community’s fight against the 1980s AIDS/HIV epidemic while the U.S. government neglected it.
“It was amazing to me when monkeypox started to surface, and all of a sudden, everyone was so quick to say, ‘Oh, that’s just another gay disease. Let’s not pay attention,’” Sullivan said. 
“It makes me feel like we learned nothing from that first epidemic, where so many tens of thousands of people in the queer community died because of such a slow response,” he added. “In the early ‘80s, I was a teenager. Now, I’m in my late fifties. We’ve made a lot of strides. But to see another slow response to what is considered to be a ‘gay disease’ is disheartening, to say the least.”
Kilner echoed Sullivan’s concern about the stigma of a “gay disease,” noting that AIDS was incorrectly labeled this way when it first surfaced. 
“And then it crossed over to the straight community, and everyone took interest in it,” Kilner said. “The same thing could happen with monkeypox. It’s prudent to to make sure it isn’t just a ‘gay thing.’” 
John Blosnich, director of the Center for LGBTQ+ Health Equity at USC, said public messaging about monkeypox failed to convey the complexity of the virus, prompting some to make false equivalences between monkeypox and sexually transmitted diseases. 
“People do not fully understand how [monkeypox] is transmitted. If they think it’s an STD, that inaccuracy leads them to not taking adequate precautions to protect themselves,” Blosnich said “An illness can be affecting one community disproportionately, but you can also balance that with anti-stigma messages.”
Dubey expressed concern about USC’s lack of effort to clear misconceptions about the virus. At the bare minimum, USC Student Health could guide students about prevention practices when socializing on and around campus, Dubey said. 
“I still think there’s a stigma where it’s hard to differentiate between a skin-to-skin contact-spreading virus and an STI,” they said. “A public information campaign geared towards the facts would be helpful to students.”
Frequent close-contact interactions at college, whether through hook-up culture or at crowded football tailgates, make it even more of an imperative for USC to dispel the stigma of a “gay virus,” Dubey said. 
Blosnich worries that a regional disparity in access to monkeypox-related resources could also disproportionately affect queer people of color and those who are low-income and live in neighborhoods lacking LGBTQ health clinics, including South Central and East L.A. 
“If a community doesn’t have resources in it and has to travel to get those resources, that’s automatically a disadvantage,” Blosnich said. “Can someone who serves in West L.A. really know the context of someone living in South or East L.A.? These areas don’t really have their own homegrown resources with providers who live in their communities.” 
The travel time Blosnich refers to is a 40-minute metro or car ride to the Ted Watkins Memorial Park vaccination site — the only one in South L.A., according to the L.A. County DPH. This disparity may be why South L.A. residents received just 6% of the 71,266 total vaccines administered in the county as of Nov 9. 
For USC students, lack of time and transit could hinder accessibility to the vaccine. 
“It’s a shame that in L.A., the closest by-transit monkeypox vaccines for me are on 103rd Street,” Dubey said. “I [have] to take the blue line all the way down to Watt, and then get off three blocks from a health center and get their vaccine.”
If USC rolls out monkeypox vaccination at any point, it has both the resources and opportunity to serve local residents in vaccine deserts, Dubey said — an approach that would diverge from the University’s coronavirus vaccine rollout.  
Sullivan and his husband live across from Kedren Medical Center in South L.A. They said even if the county expanded vaccination in the area, they would be concerned about white Angelenos from the West Side coming in and taking shots away from local residents.
“For the COVID vaccines, we’d all of a sudden see all these white people coming to our neighborhood because they’re getting the vaccine. And Latinos can’t take time off from work,” Sullivan said. “It was hard to watch. I have a front row seat to this despairing difference.”
Dubey is still unsure of where they will go to receive their second dose of the monkeypox vaccine. 
“If I could somehow make it into one of the bars close to campus, I would definitely do that,” they said. “I have zero experience going to these spaces.”
Dubey, who is under 21, hesitates to approach these bars since their websites and flyers don’t clarify any age restrictions for the immunization portions of their floorspace.
“But I do know that there’s a lot of queer people in our area, and they have trust factor like any minority group. We do have our own little network of people and community as a safe space,” Dubey said. “So it makes sense that the community would feel safe together building these locations where you can get the vaccine.”

A summer trip to Las Vegas and a mustering up of courage is all it took for Rudalys Ruiz, a senior majoring in global health, to imagine her perfect social life once she returned to campus.
Ruiz’s lack of a strong friend group on the trip forced her to take matters into her own hands. To create the experience she aspired to have, she spent the entire trip going up to random strangers, chatting with them and seeing where it would take her. 
Ruiz felt fearless. And despite feeling terrified in the moment, the reward of a good time was all she needed to convince herself to carry that same energy back on campus and into a new career endeavor. 
Described as a “whim of the moment” decision, Ruiz’s promotional service, Rue’s Hosting, coordinates outings to Los Angeles restaurants and clubs and provides access to private events. For each event Rue’s Hosting promotes, Ruiz ensures that a group of individuals have an amazing experience.
For her most recent events, Ruiz has focused on building a comfortable relationship with female clientele, conducting outings of around 10 to 30 women.
Her business’s female focus comes at a time when L.A. nightlife can often feel overwhelming and unsafe for women. A night out at L.A.’s most popular clubs often carries risks of being racially profiled, harassed or assaulted for many women. These negative interactions can sometimes seem unavoidable for Ruiz, who deals with this behavior both on and off the job.
“Sometimes the men that you encounter on these endeavors can be really disrespectful, misogynistic and racist,” Ruiz said. “I need to always remind myself, ‘You never want to overreact, even if they disrespected you and you have the right to overreact, because all it’s going to do is prove them right.’” 
It is Ruiz’s understanding of what it’s like to be a woman on the other end of L.A nightlife that allows her to look after the women she caters to. 
“Sometimes it can be unsafe, really uncomfortable and it can go to different extremes,” said Jolie Gross, a senior majoring in business administration. “But having a strong woman there will make you feel more comfortable.”
Whether it’s creating a group chat for every outing, communicating with bouncers who give women a hard time when getting in or making sure security is available for any altercation or uncomfortable situation, Ruiz takes precautions to ensure that women don’t have the same negative experiences that they might’ve had in the past. 
“I want Rue’s Hosting to have a strong feminine foundation because we have to stick together at the end of the day,” Ruiz said. “Because no matter how much we think we can separate ourselves from the patriarchy, it is still constantly looming over our heads.”
Her service works in partnership with RARE Nightlife, a promotional company that works directly with exclusive venues to provide them with guests. As one of their promoters, Ruiz ensures that the venues that work with RARE Nightlife gain traction. 
While Ruiz has generally received support from others in the promotional scene, as a young female college student in a male-dominated field, Ruiz’s legitimacy as a promoter can often be downplayed. For her, receiving doubt and negativity from others is something that comes with being in the industry.
Leslie Ann Lopez, the chief operating officer of RARE Nightlife and a recent UCLA graduate who partnered with Ruiz earlier this semester, expressed a similar sentiment. 
“I think being able to navigate [the space] is understanding your own worth as a girl or minority. Even if you’re not in a position of dominance, I think there’s still a level of respect that you should be getting,” Lopez said. 
However, Ruiz continues to prove herself. In only its first month of operation, Rue’s Hosting has gained access to some of the most exclusive clubs and star-studded events in L.A., including a Rich The Kid performance, a Zues afterparty and just recently, GloRilla’s afterparty for the American Music Awards.  
“Ruiz has definitely shown me a lot of new places that I wasn’t aware of. She knows all the best spots,” said Lexie Jackson, a graduate student studying entrepreneurship and innovation. “She has an insider view and knows which ones are good and which ones aren’t.”
Currently, Rue’s Hosting has weekly Sunday dinners at Toca Madera followed by a night at Nightingale Plaza, an exclusive nightclub in West Hollywood. Every Wednesday, complimentary dinners are also given at Tao Restaurant, followed by an outing to The Highlight Room, a rooftop bar and grill located on top of the Dream Hollywood hotel.
As a fairly new endeavor, outings by Rue’s Hosting have consisted primarily of Ruiz’s friends, However, Ruiz hopes to branch out and garner more clientele, serving all genders, primarily using the service’s instagram page, @rueshosting, for promotion. 
The service’s expansion also goes beyond just dinners and nightclubs, as Ruiz plans to host a variety of events, such as house parties, barbecues and downtown L.A. rooftop parties in the upcoming semester. 
While Ruiz’s nightlife experiences span the gamut — both personally and professionally —  her  social life drastically differed during the period of isolation that came from living through the coronavirus pandemic, which left her freshman year experience unexpectedly cut short.  
Ruiz described how unlike most classes, the freshman class – now seniors – lacked the same level of guidance from upperclassmen on how to navigate the University’s social scene. 
The global shutdown left people unsure of how to approach social interactions, and Ruiz emphasized how in an attempt to return to normalcy, a lack of transparency arose. 
“Coming back here as a senior and having a full perspective of what it was like beforehand and what it’s like now, a lot of people are struggling,” Ruiz said. “And we’re not so open to talk about it because we are putting up this facade.” 
Ruiz hopes Rue’s Hosting provides people with a glimpse of how things were before, promoting an atmosphere that prioritizes building relationships and connecting with one another.  
Rue’s Hosting’s pre-game dinners have aided in facilitating the one-on-one conversation and more comfortable experience that Ruiz has been wanting. 
Prior to traveling with groups to nightclubs, Ruiz often hosts more intimate complimentary dinners. There, people are forced to “break the ice,” interacting with new faces and bonding over the fun night they anticipate having.
“Her service is more like a friendship, a connection. She wants to connect with you on a deeper level, which a lot of promoters don’t do.” Gross said. 
Growing up in Massachusetts, Ruiz lived a relatively sheltered life, making L.A. nightlife an adjustment that she had to learn how to navigate. However, Ruiz accredits the values instilled by her mother and her life back home for how she runs her business today. 
 “I grew up with the value of integrity; just focus, and you’ll get the things that you want,” Ruiz said. “And one of the things I want is a fun atmosphere.”

You can have the venue, the lights, the refreshments and the people, but a party is nothing without the music. DJs breathe life into parties, mixing the latest, freshest beats that uplift the dance floor, get bodies moving and create a vibe to last a lifetime — or at least one night. More than that, though, DJs highlight the beauty of culture and community with music.   
On campus and in the city of Los Angeles, some USC students double as DJs, making their names known with sets that you wouldn’t hear at the average frat row function. Playing genres like Afrobeats, Brazilian funk, reggaeton and amapiano, two Black student DJs told us more about how they’ve been navigating the world of disc jockeying while honoring their cultural backgrounds.
Effa Fouda, a sophomore majoring in business, has navigated gigs in L.A. and on campus — including the 2022 Gear Fest, a USC concert hosted by USC’s Black Student Assembly and its member organization Creative Experience. The headliner musicians were IDK and D. Smoke. 
The African music Fouda grew up listening to has influenced his style and technique from the start. When he DJs, he hopes to share the Afrobeats genre with his audience and inspire them to discover music from different cultures. 
“I’ve always been someone that’s been interested in music and the history of music. And I think that music is really something that brings different people together,” he said.  “Hopefully when I’m DJing, I hope you discover new music that you like.” 
Fouda shares this love for spreading African culture through music with Pammie Emefiele, a sophomore majoring in electrical and computer engineering. Emefiele is looking to make his mark in the DJ scene with a vast range of genres, namely amapiano and Afrobeats. He also weaves in tunes from France and the United Kingdom. 
Emefiele’s set is largely inspired by his Nigerian pride, but his traipse into DJing is motivated by his very simple desire to allow people to have fun. Emefiele wants to be the person that creates a party’s perfect but delicate atmosphere, and DJing’s creative elements — mixing and experimenting — allow him to do just that. 
“I think what kind of inspired me to start DJing was the fact that I was going to a lot of parties [and] heard the same type of music, and DJs that weren’t really taking their craft seriously. It was just people that would just play music, fading in [and] fading out,” he said. 
The attention to diversity of these students’ DJ sets hasn’t gone unnoticed by students. 
Amuche Okeke, a sophomore majoring in pharmacology and drug development and the co-executive director of the Pan African Student Association (PASA) recalled Emefiele’s impact as a DJ. During a bonfire hosted between PASA and the East African Student Association, Okeke, who is Nigerian-American, appreciated the inclusion of Afrobeats, Black American music, and music from various East African countries.
“So when Pammie did play [East African songs], a lot of the East African students were like ‘Whoa, no way. Are you serious?’ and they got super hyped and fun. It’s important to have people like that on campus who will cater to your culture,” Okeke said.“I feel like people were really excited and really happy. They were satisfied with the music that was played because they don’t get a taste of that everywhere or really anywhere on campus.”
It’s positive feedback like Okeke’s that motivates student DJs such as Emefiele, who are often doing this work without any economic gain. In fact, Emefiele still holds on to a moment during his first gig when a professional DJ told him he had great potential. 
“To see that so many people are interested and anticipating seeing me DJ is what empowers me to keep DJing and to keep working on my craft,” he said. 
Okeke says that DJs such as Fouda and Emefiele are not only getting the word out about Afrobeats as a genre, but strengthening a push for more Afrocentric nightlife events at USC. Emefiele’s gig at the beach was just one event of the many that Okeke thinks will be organized more often. She weighs this prediction on the diversity of USC’s Black student community, and Afrobeats’ rise in popularity among students of different racial backgrounds. 
“A simple event like hosting a beach day and making sure people’s music from their culture was played — it’s just a simple thing,” Okeke said. “And people really were receptive towards this. I actually do think that we’re moving towards having a lot more events like that and other orgs are also following suit.”
Recognizing this, Fouda takes charge of planning events as well. With his parties, he wants to showcase not just his skill as a DJ and event planner, but also create opportunities for fellow DJs in the USC community. 
“[Planning] basically entails finding DJs that I think people would like and then bringing people together in event spaces [and] venues. Sometimes selling tickets, sometimes it can be free,” Fouda said. “So I guess for the future, [I am] trying to establish myself more in that scene and create a space for DJs to show off their talents as well as allow people to have a good time.”
For each of these DJs, taking on larger-scale events and eventually tours and festivals is the ultimate goal. But for now, they will be sharpening their next big set, lining up gigs and making their mark in the L.A. music scene. Be on the lookout for their sets on campus and around the city because they’ll be making sure they have you on the dance floor.  
“I love interacting with the crowd. So my biggest message would be ‘If you’re coming to one of my sets, you better be prepared to dance,” Emefiele said. “I don’t like wall huggers… I want everybody to be interacting, everybody to be dancing, everybody to be having a good time. That’s my biggest message every time I try to DJ.”

Before the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Evgeny Dengub planned to discuss Russian ballet, figure skating and pop music in his “Advanced Russian in Popular Culture” class. After Feb. 24, when the Kremlin launched its first assaults on major Ukrainian cities, he knew he no longer could.
“Neither me nor my students were suddenly [still] interested in the centuries of Russian great art or culture, or contemporary culture, for that matter,” said Dengub, a professor of Russian, director of the Russian program and director of the Center for Languages and Cultures. “All we talked about was the war.”
Dengub began to use articles about the conflict and official documents from the Russian government to teach his class Russian in today’s context. The war, which led nearly eight million people to flee Ukraine, became the elephant in his classroom, just as it did in USC’s Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures.
The department, which offers undergraduate majors in Russian and Central European Studies and describes itself as being “dedicated primarily to the study of the language, literature and culture of modern Russia,” released a statement condemning the Russian aggression shortly after it broke out.
“As scholars who devote our lives to the study of Russia and eastern Europe, the faculty of the department of Slavic Languages and Literatures unequivocally condemn Russia’s flagrantly illegal and barbaric aggression against its fellow Slavic nation of Ukraine,” the statement read. “We stand with the Ukrainians defending their country and nation.”
The department was initially concerned about being identified with the government of Russia and the Putin regime, said Interim Department Chair Thomas Seifrid, who also serves as a professor of Russian literature. Seifrid said he feels the distinction between the Russian state and the study of Russian culture and language is a critical one to make.
“In no way are we apologists for [Putin’s] brutal and barbaric war,” Seifrid said. “We don’t support it, but also we don’t feel that the study of Russia or Russian should be set aside or abandoned just because of this war going on.”
Dengub, too, is against the so-called “cancel culture” that, he said, leads certain things to be speedily “deleted” because they contradict contemporary rhetoric and opinions. Dengub pointed to Joseph Brodsky, a Nobel laureate who penned a poem depicting Ukraine in a negative light, who he believes should not be banned from academia despite his views. 
“I don’t think it’s reason enough — at an academic level, at the university level — to just say, ‘Okay, we’re not teaching Brodsky anymore. Brodsky’s persona non grata.’ No,” Dengub said.
A survey of world history, Seifrid argued, suggests that most cultures have engaged in bloody wars, repressed minorities and committed other heinous acts that make them worthy, to some, of being “canceled.” Scholars and the public, he said, should resist giving Russian culture the same treatment. 
“What is additionally significant about Russia, not unique to Russia, but I think stands out about its culture, is [that it is] the kind of culture … that was produced in opposition to the political regime,” Seifrid said.
Russianists’ role is critical amid the war, Seifrid said, as they can astutely explain the mindset that produced anti-Ukraine aggression without necessarily supporting it, and provide perspective on the conflict that only those with a wealth of knowledge on Russian history, culture and language can. 
Teaching not significantly impacted
The department didn’t issue guidance on curriculums after the war broke out, as professors have “fairly large autonomy” over the topics and materials they teach, Dengub said. 
Just as Dengub changed the focus of his popular culture class after the war began, so did Elena Petrova, an assistant lecturer of “Intermediate Russian II” and a graduate student in the department. The war, she said, led her to screen Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s TV show, “Servant of the People,” which fits into one of the class’ themes: household problems and chores. 
Petrova said the war hasn’t changed her teaching in a significant way, as Russian language pedagogy in the department isn’t about the state, but about culture. When the Russian mobilization began Sept. 21, however, Petrova, who is originally from Russia, had a weight bearing on her: the possibility of her brother being drafted to fight for the Russian military in Ukraine.
“I had to go to class after it and my task was not to burst in tears in front of students,” said Petrova, who also said she avoids taking up too much class time with talk of the war, preferring to discuss it with her students outside of class.
Considerations about teaching Russian history and thought, including expanding and de-imperializing the teaching of Russian — to encompass the greater Slavic world outside of Russia, including Ukraine, Poland, Belarus and other former Soviet republics — were not necessarily galvanized by the war, Seifrid said. 
In his class, “Russian Thought and Civilization,” Seifrid has made adjustments to the curriculum and language use for some years. In the early weeks of the class, he emphasizes the shared ancestry of Russia and Ukraine, using the term “Rus’-ian” instead of Russian on assignments and syllabi to highlight that the modern Russian state was once Kievan Rus’, an early feudal monarchy that lasted from 882 to 1240 A.D. 
Enrollment slightly down, not “total catastrophe”
Interest in the department’s courses decreased slightly since the war broke out, Seifrid said, but was not the “total catastrophe” in enrollment some department members anticipated. In the past, he said, when the Soviet Union was involved in a reprehensible act, such as shooting down Korean Air Lines flight 007 in 1983, the department saw dramatic increases in enrollment from students interested in learning about Cold War dynamics. 
Dengub said he hasn’t noticed a change in students’ interest in Russian language or culture, “for good or for worse,” which isn’t surprising to him. While some of his colleagues have expressed disappointment that students aren’t as emotionally involved or caring about the war, he maintains what he calls a realist perspective and doesn’t expect students to be as affected as he is.
“The war in Ukraine is huge, is tragic, is senseless — yes, but it’s not the only war,” Dengub said. “We should be realistic in our expectations of our students’ behavior and attitudes.”
Russia study abroad programs cease
Erica Camisa Morale, a Dornsife Fellow in General Education who studies 17th and 18th- century Slavic poetry and teaches classes on Russian literature and history, planned to study abroad in Russia after completing her graduate studies at USC. 
“When the war started, in my very naive mind, I hoped that the war would finish soon. And then it was like, maybe not summer 2023, but 2023, but I don’t think [it’ll be over by then],” Morale said.
Research in Russia for graduate students and faculty like Morale has become “essentially impossible,” Seifrid said, unless students are Russian citizens. The department does not advise anyone to go to Russia. In the case of language study, the department is looking at programs in former Soviet republics that have sizable Russophone populations. 
The Trans-Siberian Railway and St. Petersburg study abroad programs previously put on by USC were halted indefinitely at the start of the war. The programs began to be reworked amid the worsening of the relationship between the United States and Russia even before the war. All factors combined led to a switch from the Russian programs to a Russian-language program in Kazakhstan, Dengub said. 
“Maybe we will, in three, four, five, 10 years, probably go back to Russia — obviously, I do want to,” said Dengub, who used to lead a St. Petersburg program at Middlebury College, where he previously taught.
Slavic department aided graduate students
In light of the war, Petrova said the department responded “very humanely,” increasing graduate stipends and helping graduate students — most of whom, she said, are victims of the conflict — continue to attend and present at conferences. 
“They tried to help graduate students as much as they can, in terms of helping us to accommodate the situation and simply not to fall apart, which I’m very grateful for,” Petrova said.
Seifrid said that, thankfully, there was no need for emergency support among the department’s graduate students. 
No Ukraine specialist at USC
As a relatively small department, the Slavic Languages and Literatures department does not currently have a Ukrainist on its faculty, nor does it offer language classes in Ukrainian or dedicated classes on Ukrainian history or modern-day Ukraine. 
“We are simply not currently able to teach a course on, say, post-Soviet Ukraine,” Seifrid said. “I wish we could. But we don’t have that expertise here.”
Dengub said that while the field is discussing decolonizing Russian curriculums and bringing in diversity from other Russophone or post-Soviet republics, he doesn’t feel like he can teach extensively about Ukraine in his classes. He doesn’t exclude anything about Ukraine purposefully, he said, but tries to focus on his “actual charge,” which is teaching Russian language and culture. 
“I’ve only been to Ukraine once. I didn’t study formally Ukraine or Ukrainian language, so I don’t feel the authority to talk or to teach about Ukraine in my Russian language class,” Dengub said.
UCLA, which Seifrid said has a larger Slavic department than USC does, offers language classes in the Ukrainian language, both elementary and advanced, as well as Ukrainian literature. 
Seifrid described American higher education as highly “reactive,” only adjusting when outside conditions require it to, as with the rise of Arabic language teaching after the eruption of conflicts between the U.S. and countries in the Middle East. 
“There are departments that have been able to hire Ukrainianists and … I hope they’re able to retain them when, as I hope very much, the war ends and attention turns away from Ukraine,” Seifrid said.
USC, Seifrid said, did not come up with funds to hire Russian or Ukrainian scholars looking for a place to work away from political oppression after the war began, while other schools, including Yale University and the University of Chicago, did. 
Graduate students held fundraiser for Ukraine
Graduate students in the department organized a fundraiser to aid Ukraine in late April, raising $2,000 — double their initial goal. The group coordinated with colleagues in Europe, who were more aware of the kinds of supplies and forms of aid needed on the ground, said Morale, who was involved in the fundraiser’s organization. 
Proceeds from the event went toward Help Us Help, an organization based in Toronto, Ontario that is “providing urgently requested medical supplies to volunteer medical units in Ukraine.”
One graduate student created artwork for tote bags and mugs sold for around $20, while Dengub designed stickers sold for $1 at the group’s one-day stand outside Tommy Trojan. The students also distributed a flyer that included a geographical map of Ukraine and key events in the war, showing before and after photos of buildings affected by missile strikes and bombings. 
The fundraiser, Morale said, was motivated by the group’s stance against violence and military aggression. 
“We didn’t want this just to be a fundraiser in terms of getting money from people,” Morale said. “We wanted to also, on the other hand, inform and convey a message of peace.”

One hundred years ago, actor Douglas Fairbanks and the president of USC played a fencing match against each other. As they traded jabs and conversation across the piste, Fairbanks advocated for the school to begin offering film classes — now, in the middle of the top-ranked School of Cinematic Arts, there stands a statue of Fairbanks holding a screenplay in one hand, and a blade in the other.
This November, the USC Fencing Club celebrated its 100-year anniversary on campus, with team members and coaches alike reflecting on their storied history — including sending multiple athletes to compete in the Olympics, bringing together now-married couples and contributing to the beginning of the film school.
The club has accepted both beginning fencers and longtime champions alike to the Physical Education building on Tuesday and Thursday nights for practice, with its coaches and alumni hanging new stories and accomplishments on the club’s legacy throughout the years. Club alumna Janice Lee York Romary competed in more Olympics than any other Trojan; and Helene Mayer, another club Olympian who won gold in the 1928 and silver in 1936, was pressured into fencing for Nazi Germany as a Jewish woman to keep her family safe during World War II. 
Today’s head coach is Scott Frank, an alumnus whose tenure at USC fencing has lasted since 1998. In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Frank reflected on his long experience at the club.
“Coaching is not just about knowing the sport more than anybody else. It’s about making sure everybody there can learn at their own pace and get something out of it,” Frank said. “It’s about making sure everybody there feels fulfilled [by] coming every night.”
The late-night practices involve various activities, including drilling and free fencing matches between team members. The club uses all three different fencing weapons: the epée, where the entire body is the target to score a point; the sabre, where most of the upper body is the target; and the foil, where only the torso is the target. 
According to club president Jude Sorkin, a junior majoring in aerospace engineering, the members are close with each other and are always enthusiastic when showing up to practice, regardless of how much experience they have — or the time of the night.
“It feels a lot like a team, which is nice to see,” Sorkin said. “[At] just about every practice, we end at midnight, but a lot of times we’ll stand outside talking until about 1 a.m.”
Uniting athletes just starting out in the sport as well as lifetime fencers has proven to be a valuable element to the members of the club, including Matt Blanco, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering who had been fencing for eight years before joining the club last year. He said that fighting one-on-one matches each night at practice allows people to know what techniques they need to work on or build off of, calling the environment “very collaborative.”
“Our camaraderie is comparable to any NCAA team … we support each other, we grow with each other,” Blanco said. “I share my own experiences with fencing to my teammates, and they do the same to me. It’s a lot of team building and a lot of self-growth.”
That spirit of closeness brought some USC fencing athletes together for the long-term as well — Frank knows of at least three couples in the last 15 years who have gotten married from meeting at the club, one of which asked him to officiate their wedding.
“It’s just incredible to see thousands of people pass through your door and learn something, and they always remember 20 [or] 30 years later that they took that fencing class back in college,” Frank said. “It’s something you just remember forever, because you got to have fun and run around with the sword — and smack people.”

The newly official Pad Project at USC recognized National Homelessness Youth Awareness Month Nov. 1 by kicking off their first drive of the year: collecting menstrual products to donate to the SkidRow Community Refresh Spot, which gives unhoused people a safe place to shower, do laundry, use the bathroom, get drug testing kits and treat injuries, and is always in need of menstrual products.
Catherine Chan, a senior majoring in global health and president of the Period Project at USC, said that this location was chosen partly because of the safe haven it provides to unhoused menstruators.  
“The reason why we chose the SkidRow Community Refresh Spot is because in the topic of period poverty, there’s a focus on, ‘Hey, we need to get these products to people,’ but it really is about more than products. Pain medication, water access, a proper garbage disposal: all these factors come in when we’re talking about menstrual equity,” Chan said. 
Stephanie Lee, a graduate student studying health systems management engineering and a Pad Project member, said that by choosing the Refresh Spot for their donations, they were able to reach more people who may need them.
“Oftentimes, these menstrual products are only offered in women’s shelters, and not all women menstruate and not all menstruators are women,” Lee said. “By choosing [the SkidRow Community Refresh Spot], we’re able to be way more inclusive to the whole community of Skid Row.”
Last Thursday, the Pad Project at USC began sorting the initial donations into kits that could then be passed onto the Community Refresh spot. Each kit had 10 pads, tampons and pantyliners, and just from the first donations, the chapter was able to create 30 kits — the goal for the entire drive will be creating 100 by Nov. 30. Chan said she hopes that through these kits, they can help homeless menstruators maintain a sense of cleanliness and dignity.  
“Menstruators who do not have access to period products because they’re expensive, they’re hard to get and shelters don’t often provide them, they often have to resort to unsanitary alternatives, like old newspapers or rags,” Chan said. “[These donations provide] a way of being able to take care of their periods and manage their periods with dignity.”
Isabel Chavero, a sophomore majoring in political science and a Pad Project member, said she hopes this drive will provide a brief respite to unhoused people in L.A.  
“Donating these menstrual products hopefully will give [houseless people] one less thing to worry about for a short amount of time,” Chavero said. “There’s so many barriers that houseless people already have to face, and having a comfortable experience with your period or when you’re menstruating is something that shouldn’t be viewed as a luxury.”
Chavero said the aim of having the drive on campus is to bring attention to the fact that sanitary items are just as essential, and therefore just as needed by unhoused people, as food and water.
“A lot of the time when we talk about donating to houseless people, it’s very much about food, water and clothing, which are all very important,” Chavero said. “Sometimes, people don’t consider that people facing homelessness also get their period: it’s not something you can stop.”
Globally, Lee said the Pad Project not only aims to serve frontline communities, but to give them the resources needed to support themselves without outside assistance. 
“[The Pad Project] tries to implement this social enterprise model where they have pad making machines and, with that, these women are able to start their own business where they actually are able to manufacture these products,” Lee said. “It not only supports the delivery of menstrual products, but also supports women in business.”
The USC chapter, Lee said, specifically intends to deliver period equity within the greater L.A. community. When not running the drive, the club focuses on a different topic of menstrual equity each week, meeting in CPA 109 every Thursday from 7:30-8:30. Subjects range from the effect of menstrual inequality on L.A.’s unhoused population and incarcerated people, to Black activism within menstruation, to destigmatizing periods. 
The organization’s upcoming events include a screening of the documentary, “Period. End of Sentence,” and a “bleed green” event in April centered around eco-friendly menstrual options, such as menstrual cups, period underwear and sewing reusable cloth menstrual pads. Through the end of November, the club’s full focus will be on the period product drive.
“It’s exciting because we get to help people within our local community,” Lee said. “We’re able to see the big picture with what this larger organization does globally, but with the resources we have, we can focus mainly on community.”

For anyone who has ever commuted in Los Angeles, you know that there are two things you need to get through the day: coffee and music. Everyday, I venture from the hot and dry San Fernando Valley, the sprawling northern half of L.A. made up of countless small cities from Van Nuys to Burbank, to Downtown Los Angeles. A trip that should take only 20 minutes can often become an hour-long ride thanks to the infamous L.A. traffic. 
Through the countless hours commuting to USC, I have relied on music not only to make the drive more bearable, but also to help me reflect on my relationship with this chaotic yet beautiful city. So buckle up as I take you on the musical journey of my everyday L.A. commute. 
No matter what time you wake up in the morning, the sun will always be out to greet you before you get a chance to open your eyes. Even in the wee small hours of the morning, the vibrant L.A. sun gives me the energy I need to wake up and get on the road. With my sunglasses and cup of coffee on the ready, I start my commute with a song that reflects the bright and energetic nature around me: Boney M.’s “Sunny.”
Released in 1976 by the legendary disco quartet, this funky pop cover encapsulates my never-ending love for the “sunshine bouquets” that L.A. sends my way. While some may view the constant sunshine as irksome, the sun helps “ease the pain” of my long commute and keeps my spirits high. Blasting “Sunny,” I momentarily forget the soul-crushing traffic awaiting me on the freeways. 
Merging onto the 134 Freeway, I turn on “Another Day of Sun” from one of my favorite films, “La La Land” (2016). I always hope that the iconic freeway scene, where motorists jump out of their cars and start dancing on the highway, will magically turn into a reality. While I have yet to break out in song and dance with my fellow commuters, this ode to L.A. makes me feel part of a community of dreamers. 
In a city as large and sprawling as L.A., it is easy to feel lonely and isolated. However, “Another Day of Sun” reminds Angelenos of how we are all on the same boat (or in this case, freeway) “chasing all the lights that shine.”
As I reach the cursed 101 Freeway —always in a state of indefinite traffic — and my coffee dwindles to its last drops, I snap out of my sunny reverie and face the drudgery of commuting. The grueling traffic captures the irony of the city, as Angelenos are always rushing to get somewhere, yet they are stuck in the same spot. 
In these moments of stillness, my mind starts to wander and what better song to accompany my daydreams than “California Dreamin’.” While there are many covers of this song, my favorite is José Felicano’s, most notably featured in Quentin Tarantino’s love letter to the city, “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood’’ (2019).  This classic Southern California song captures the ultimate California state of mind: always dreamin’.  Even if you live the “California Dream,’’ surrounded by majestic canyons and the glistening sea, L.A. can feel elusive and almost unreal. Stuck in traffic and lost in dreams, it is easy to lose a grasp of time and reality in this fantastical city.  
At a certain point during my commute, my car’s Bluetooth always disconnects (I should really get that checked) and I have no choice but to turn on the radio. However, growing up in Los Angeles, I remember listening to the radio with my mom as she drove me to school across the Valley. Since our car did not have Bluetooth, we relied on the radio to keep our morning commutes entertaining. Radio stations, like KOST 103.5, KJAZZ 88.1 or KEARTH 101, shaped my lifelong discography. While endless advertisements deter me from listening to the radio nowadays, I enjoy discovering new songs from my favorite local disc jockeys, so I can expand my playlists. 
With the Downtown skyline finally coming into view and the Exposition Blvd. exit in sight, the traffic lightens up and I end my commute on a relaxing note in order to wash away all the stress incurred over the course of my journey. Opening all the windows and letting in the L.A. breeze flow through the car, I listen to the funk-jazz instrumental song “Breezin’” by jazz-guitarist George Benson. As the cold morning breeze cuts through the hot rays of the sun and Benson’s guitar flawlessly flows, I feel as if I am approaching the beaches of Pacific Palisades, instead of USC. 
So, is commuting everyday tiring? Yes. Does it feel like I waste precious time sitting around in traffic? Yes. But driving back and forth on the 170, 134, 101 and 110 Freeways (no, I’m not just listing random numbers), has given me the chance not only to listen to some great music, but also to appreciate my city and its culture in a new light.

For my eighth grade Halloween, I dressed up as Coraline from the 2009 movie “Coraline.” I sprayed my hair a bright blue — or as best as I possibly could, anyway — and paired it with a bright yellow raincoat and bright yellow rain boots. Although it took people who had watched “Coraline” to understand that I was, in fact, the titular character, that Halloween I felt like an intrepid (and bitter) explorer, feeling like I’d adopted a new persona even if it was only for a day.
Why did my eighth grade self choose to dress up as Coraline? Well, my eighth grade self thought that “Coraline,” produced by the formidable stop-motion company LAIKA Studios, was a testament to the power of animated storytelling. If you asked me today, I’d still say the same.
“Coraline” is one of those animated films that I think thrives on both artistic and narrative fronts. Adapted from Neil Gaiman’s novel of the same name, this story about Coraline Jones, a young girl who steps into a new, seemingly idealistic world with ideal versions of her parents, feels incredibly engaging. With all the careful detail that the stop-motion animators paid to crafting each character, how the story is rendered for the screen lends an atmospheric depth. 
“Coraline” showed my eighth grade self that animation didn’t necessarily have to be comedic and family-friendly. Classified as a dark fantasy horror film by Horror Film Wiki, “Coraline” uses the different freedoms associated with animation to take its character into a whole other world with supernatural, grotesque consequences. That kind of visual complexity — for the film, illustrated most visibly in the contrast between these two worlds — is a quality that I would only hope to achieve in my own scripts for my “Writing for Animation” class. 
As someone who watches mostly animated comedy films, the influence “Coraline” has had on me might seem a bit unexpected. After all, many of my own scripts have leaned towards the genre of dark fantasy by virtue of my own fascination with social messaging and how horror can represent issues to great extremes. (For USC students who are looking for a screenwriting class in SCA, “Writing for Animation” offers a comprehensive introduction.)
Looking back, though, it’s undeniable that “Coraline,” as an animated adaptation of a novel, showcased my two primary interests: literary adaptation and animation. For the latter, I became a fan of LAIKA Studios because of “Coraline,” which drew me to 2012’s “ParaNorman,” a film that I similarly found instrumental in my own study of animated stories. “ParaNorman,” about a boy with the ability to see ghosts, is another example of how the supernatural is imagined through the medium of animation. 
This past summer, I interned for the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences in the Academy Film Archive. Although I worked primarily remotely on the Cultural Equity and Inclusion Project, I was able to witness the importance of archival processes in the times I visited the Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study. Even as someone who doesn’t intend on becoming a film archivist, that experience exposed me to the world of public access.
LAIKA Studios has devoted itself to this mission of behind-the-scenes preservation, which has solidified my belief in the studio’s ability to make its animators’ talents available to the public. This September, they announced the “LAIKA Archives” series, released on YouTube, which gives users a look at the different elements involved in creating the studio’s films. In one of these videos, costume designer Deb Cook shows audiences the nuances in costuming. 
According to Cook in the video, Mel Jones, Coraline’s mother in the real world, has a “schlumpy” sweater with loose jeans, giving off a faded appearance. The Other Mother, on the “other” hand (I had to include this pun), has shinier pants with a more “tailored” sweater. These aesthetic differences add to the thematic symbolism of the two mothers, where the Other Mother represents the illusion that Coraline nearly chooses and Coraline’s real mother represents the reality that Coraline needs to sacrifice. 
It’s amazing to me that LAIKA has made the intention behind these pieces and their films available to fans of the studios in this digital, digestible format. One thing I’ll carry with me from my time working in an archival space is that engagement with the public should always be at the forefront of filmmakers’ minds. After all, archives are places of preserving memory — like the one that I think of about my eighth grade Halloween — but, as LAIKA demonstrates, they’re also places where we can think about how films, in all their fantastic identities, are made behind the screen.

Stormzy is the face of the U.K. rap scene. The MC is the king of grime and has performed at multiple big-name festivals like Glastonbury and Wireless. He’s known for his boisterous and cutthroat lyrics, so his latest project, “This Is What I Mean,” is a completely different spin on the 29-year-old’s usual sound.
It’s the project that Stormzy has always wanted to release. The Croydon, London rapper has always sprinkled more of a mellow and thoughtful feel to some of his tracks in his previous projects, but for this album, he really lets it run loose; his stylistic focus is evident from the first lead single.
Stormzy released “Hide & Seek” back in October, and it was completely different from his previous lead singles — “Vossi Bop” on “Heavy Is The Head” and “Big For Your Boots” on “Gang Signs & Prayer.” Both of these songs featured very aggressive tones and beats, following the typical formula that Stormzy has set for his songs, especially those that made him mainstream. 
But “Hide & Seek” is more mellow compared to the aforementioned tracks, with an afrobeat feel to it. The song sounds similar to a track that Nigerian singer Tems might make, which isn’t too surprising considering her involvement in the writing of the track. The vocals from Oxlade, Äyanna and Teni provide a soft feel for the track that defines Stormzy’s trajectory for the album. 
The majority of this project is what Stormzy previously dabbled with in his old albums. His hardman persona is out the window, with a more gospel feel being brought out in its place. He’s put these kinds of tracks on his previous projects, with “Velvet/Jenny Francis” and “Do Better.” He lets his desire to sing on tracks run riot throughout the project, allowing himself to open up. He makes himself vulnerable, singing about how he’s changed as a person and matured through previous relationships. 
The first track on “This Is What I Mean” sets the tone for the entire project. “Fire + Water” is heavily gospel-inspired, with the MC having more of a spoken word performance for the track. The eight-minute track is very confessional, with Stormzy talking and singing about his ex and Jacob Collier hopping on the latter end of the track to seal out the emotional letter.
The titular track, which is second on the tracklist, is more of what people are used to hearing from Stormzy. He goes back to his boastful rapping style, dropping lines like, “I manifest the shit and then it happened. Said that I’ma do it, then it happens,” and “Mind your business ‘fore you mind my bread.” He also name-drops a whole load of celebrities in his bars throughout the song, ranging from Daniel Kaluuya to Harry Styles and fellow grime rapper Giggs.
He then returns to the more mellow vibe that is consistent throughout the project. There’s no heavy bass or beats on the track, unlike on previous albums. 
A highlight track on the album is “Sampha’s Plea,” where Stormzy brings Sampha on the track to do what he does best. He delivers a soulful performance about what appears to be wanting to make a relationship last rather than acting on hasty decisions. Sampha’s vocals are strong as always, proving once again why having him as a feature for a project is so coveted.
The last track of the album, “Give It To The Water,” signs off with a piano played in the background, alongside vocals with Debbie Ehirim singing about the struggles of life and just letting God help guide her through her bouts. Stormzy joins her towards the end as the two simultaneously harmonize, signing off the album with a religious feeling to it, something that Stormzy has always tried to implement in his project. It rounds off the project well, ultimately showcasing something that Stormzy is proud of and a project that he’s always wanted to release. 
Overall, Stormzy’s outpour of emotions makes this a great project and beautiful experimentation by the London artist. It doesn’t matter if the project does well commercially; it’s evident that this is Stormzy’s album, not one that he feels needs to be catered to the public. There are no callouts towards other grime rappers and there are no features with popular U.K. rappers — it’s simply Stormzy speaking on his life throughout the years. He’s finally caved into making something he’s always wanted to, and while he isn’t the best singer out there, his message, tone, use of features and instrumentals aid him in creating a solid project that has tracks that will bring listeners back to the project.

The year is 2009. Zipping down the Dallas North Tollway, I’m six years old sitting shotgun in my dad’s BMW. My hair is strewn across my face, and I’m singing wildly offkey to “Gee” by Girls’ Generation. I’m smiling, oblivious to the world.
For five years starting at age eight, my parents put me in Korean school: Saturday mornings at a local Korean church to learn my language and culture. Despite the hours I spent there, I never learned the Korean language. Teased for my “American” accent until it (and I) became the baseline for most jokes, I stopped trying completely, resolving that if I couldn’t be the best at something, I wouldn’t try at all.
When I was 13, a girl I knew declared that she was more Korean than me because she could speak the language and I couldn’t. She wasn’t even Korean and yet, over the next four years, she took every opportunity to remind me of her advantage. I knew that it had no logical basis. I knew she said it to elicit a reaction. I knew that I shouldn’t let it affect me. Still, it did.
I stopped listening to K-pop. I held Korean food and culture at an arm’s length. I framed my inability to speak Korean as some form of stand-up. 
But lately, things have been different. As an introvert from a quiet Dallas suburb, USC has pushed me out of my comfort zone.
In high school, while I was involved in business clubs, choir and the like, my day typically consisted of gym, school and home. If I found anything even slightly uncomfortable, I used my parents as excuses: “My parents want me to study.” “My parents said I can’t.” “I have a thing with my parents.” Home wasn’t just a safe space. It was a space I could crawl into to escape from the clutches of the world.
Now, I’m out in the cold.
In my first semester here, between living in an eight-person suite and juggling demanding clubs and coursework, my default hearth of comfort is noticeably absent. 
I still miss home. I’m still an introvert. When that social battery runs out, no matter what, I’m still emotionally dead. But with these continuities, things are changing. I’m pulling my identity in and holding it close. I’m reclaiming the whole of who I am from the fragments people have taken and the impressions they’ve pressed onto me. 
Yes, I’m out in the cold — but I’ve learned to love the way the frost hugs my fingers. As the chilly air wraps around me, I rest in its embrace.
Since August, I’ve made an active effort to attend events advertised by the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, like the Student Coalition for Asian Pacific Empowerment dumpling making night. I’m in the Korean American Student Association (shoutout Aerin and Hongdae fam woo). And next semester, I’m joining Korean Culture Night — all the things I would have never dared to do at 13 years old.
By consistently inserting myself into situations that lie outside of my comfort zone, I’ve grown in ways unimagined. In getting comfortable with being uncomfortable, I’ve realized that I’m not any less Korean because I can’t speak the language, and it’s okay to not be perfect when I try to learn it.
I still remember a time from when I was in high school. My dad, excited that I wanted to spend time with him, began playing Girls’ Generation songs in the car — the songs I used to love. Instead of crooning out the lyrics like a maniac, I yelled at him and scrambled to silence the music. 
I remember the wild expression that painted his whole face: surprise, confusion, hurt. What was once a sweet bonding activity had twisted into one that had me pushing him away. 
As I write this, I’m crying. I’m crying because I can’t believe that I externalized the pain I was feeling onto my dad. I’m crying because I realize the path my pain took, and how it’s affected my perspective. I’m crying because I’m listening to Girls’ Generation again.
I’m still falling down, still getting back up, still growing.
It’s bittersweet.
And it’s beautiful.
My name is Victoria Sehyoung Lee. I’m a 19-year-old Korean American from Dallas, Texas, and I can’t wait to see you all next semester.

Upon my admission to USC as a sophomore transfer last year, one of the last things I expected from my education was how much time I would spend painstakingly studying material that does not contribute to my major. 
I do not wish to claim that USC’s General Education requirements are irrelevant or unnecessary — quite the contrary actually. The educational potential that GEs possess are vital, especially towards fostering an education in which multiple disciplines can be connected. It creates a holistic way of learning, one akin to that of liberal arts schools.
After all, according to USC’s Schedule of Classes website, “The University’s general education program is structured to provide a coherent, integrated introduction to the breadth of knowledge you will need to consider yourself (and to be considered by other people) a generally well-educated person.”
However, my qualms reside in USC’s execution of how we receive our GE material and how much emphasis is placed on the workload. 
Now, I cannot speak from experience in regards to the GE-A (The Arts) and GE-B (Humanistic Inquiry) courses, as I already either completed them at my previous institution, or they were fulfilled within my Bachelor of Arts degree in Art requirements, but I can and will complain about the rigor of the GE-D (Life Sciences) and GE-E (Physical Sciences) courses that I have had to take here. 
The format of these classes is already an issue: just four exams and labs throughout the semester with as much lecture material crammed into each class section as humanly possible in between. The professor simply reads from slides, occasionally adding additional information, with the expectation that anything mentioned in class — no matter how minimal — has the potential to appear on one of the exams. 
This results in desperately taking as many notes during lecture and attempting to make sense of the incoherent words afterwards when it comes time for an exam. The days leading up to said exams all look the same: me in front of my laptop, reading through my 100+ pages of notes — and no, this is not a fabricated exaggeration — trying to memorize as much information as possible. Then, the day of the exam comes. My head is fogged with facts on the specifics on DNA, reproduction, chemical bonds and more, which I always come to find is extremely irrelevant on the exam in front of me. No, instead, the hyper specific details that were mentioned for no longer than a minute in class are staring right back at me. I take the exam, receive a mediocre grade, attend class the next day and vow to write literally everything that leaves the professor’s lips and simply repeat the process over. 
This format sounds strikingly similar to how typical high school classes are run: privileging memorization and the ability to simply regurgitate information as opposed to building on ways of thinking as, I believe, a holistic education that was vowed to us, should. The problem with this method also lies in the fact that oftentimes, information is instantaneously forgotten as soon as the exam is completed because there is no application or discussion of the material to follow. Besides, we are on the way to the next topic instantaneously, leaving everything to the past. 
So, not only are these GEs extremely time-consuming, but they also have virtually no benefit. What I have been experiencing these last two semesters is feverishly reviewing lecture material — the sheer volume of it making me feel as though my major is chemistry, not art — instead of paying attention to my other classes. As an art student myself (and I am certain is the case for every major), time is extremely important. I find myself rewatching lectures and rereading slides everyday, further procrastinating larger art projects and assignments in favor of attempting to tap into my nonexistent left-brainedness in order to pass my GE. 
While I have been able to keep my head above the water so to speak by passing these required classes, it is absolutely at the detriment to my focus in other more important courses pertaining to the career and life I wish to have after USC. 
Because of the nature of these classes — in the way that they add unnecessary stress due to their formatting — GEs should be pass-no-pass in order for students to allot enough time to other courses and endeavors. 
I understand that this sends the message that GEs are of lesser importance than other classes (they are) but until the structure of these classes are altered in a way that I think I can benefit from their educational content, I will remain extremely displeased with the fact that I have to dedicate such a tremendous amount of time towards them. 
J.W. Powell, contributor to The Atlantic and professor at Humboldt State University, describes the problem well by positing the power that a more diversified education could have. He writes that we must re-examine bachelor’s degrees, and that General Education “could and should do so much more than it does.”
While Powell advocates for more emphasis on rigorous extra-disciplinary education, we agree in that GEs should broaden and expand beyond modern boundaries of study so that while one’s major may be in a different discipline than their GE, it still remains relevant. GEs should contribute to our lives after graduation amd add more complexity to our ways of thinking, moreso than simply completing our own or another major’s requirements ever could.
Whichever comes first: making GEs pass-no-pass or altering the way in which they are taught, is of little importance to me. What I do know, however, is that something needs to change. 
Until then, time to study for my forensics midterm.

One minute, you’re watching a video of a duck eating different types of ice, and then scroll to see the next video showing the victims of another school shooting. As we rapidly switch from one emotion to another while scrolling through overstimulating and vastly unpredictable social media apps, our minds aren’t able to ever fully grasp or differentiate what we see on social media as entertainment versus reality. The more we casually see depictions of violence and learn about human crises through casual and mindless scrolls online, the less we are shocked by them and the less we feel compelled to do anything about them.
Performative activism has, and continues to be, an issue when it comes to social justice. When social media activism was at its peak during the summer of 2020, we saw a flood of Instagram stories often featuring violent videos of abuse, including police brutality, animal abuse, etc. Although it is important to raise awareness about these issues, the vast majority of the people who were both sharing and consuming content about humanity’s issues weren’t, and still aren’t, actively try to change these situations beyond the bare minimum efforts of just raising awareness. While this is better than staying silent, our rampant and reckless “activism” online is highlighting issues at the cost of our mental well-being and true activism.
Social media activism is paradoxical. On one hand, there lie benefits in the accessibility of sharing valuable and important information about the many ignored and tragic issues in our world. If one individual shares something on their story, it can reach up to hundreds of more people, meaning usually at least a few people will see it and learn about it for the first time through just those few clicks. However, the utter simplicity of reposting leads to issues in and of itself. 
Many people who fall back to social media activism don’t think or research before reposting what they think looks informational or important. This often has led to misinformation being spread through persuasive and seemingly credible posts. Even when the information is accurate, issues arise when people use reposting information as an excuse to not make any other efforts towards these causes. Although the intentions behind social media reposting aren’t necessarily that important if furthering information, if most people use it as an end-all be-all, reposting becomes counterproductive. 
Beyond these, a side effect of social media activism that we often don’t think about is that the simplicity of reposting these graphics and stories leads to our desensitization to the issues being presented. The more that we see a cause on social media, the more we end up disregarding it and ignoring the whole thing as a result.
Through excessive exposure to problem after problem during leisurely scrolls, we forget that these posts are inspired by real people’s suffering and that many people and organizations actually do need our help. Although social media activism has its upsides through sheer accessibility and reach, it often becomes meaningless, with potential to even be harmful, to our motivation to take action against, or even understand, the problems in our world. Overexposure to constant negativity in the news can also lead to constant feelings of helplessness that do more harm to our mental health than good. 
When we see different issues being presented to us in the same manner, we subconsciously register all of them as relatively the same. Therefore, we would register a post about the dangers of Elon Musk buying Twitter and Kanye’s antisemetic remarks about the same as a post about the latest TikTok scandal between influencers: another social issue to think about. Although many of us care about what is being presented to us, we find it harder to distinguish between levels of importance when it is all shown in the same context and format. 
To be able to see people dying, assaulted and hurt through other forms of violence so casually and often isn’t healthy. On top of that, when we become desensitized to seeing this brutality, we start disassociating these representations with the actuality of these events. Seeing this violence on social media allows us to distance ourselves from these realities, and allows us to ease our moral responsibility to help by simply reposting the graphics for more people to see and do the same things. This easy way out that has become so commonplace has led to the artificial distance between what we see on social media and what we know is reality. Although we might see social media activism as a better than nothing tool for justice, we must ask ourselves: Is resharing going to make a positive impact on the world, or is it simply an excuse for our lack of other action?

Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams put an end to the Heisman conversation with a strong performance against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish to close out the regular season with a 38-27 win at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Williams went 18-22 passing with 1 touchdown and added 3 rushing touchdowns. Williams now has 44 total touchdowns for the season and is the heavy favorite to win college football’s biggest honor next month. Williams spread the ball around, with 10 different players receiving for over 20 yards. 
“We got a great team, and we know our identity. We are not shying away from it. We are attacking it. We know who we are,” said Williams about the team’s strive for success on the field. “I have been trying to lead more. There’s been times throughout games, practice where I’m not leading to my ability, I am for sure trying to pick that up.” 
The Trojans took the lead early against the Fighting Irish and never let it go in their first win over Notre Dame since 2016. Just 5 minutes into the game, Williams found redshirt junior wide receiver Tahj Washington for an 11-yard touchdown reception to go up 7-0. Redshirt freshman kicker Dennis Lynch scored a 31-yard field goal after some struggles last week against UCLA to put the Trojans up 10-0 at the end of the first quarter.
Notre Dame responded with a touchdown to their standout junior tight end Michael Mayer, closing in on USC’s lead. In a quick response, Williams methodically led the offense down the field before rushing for a 5-yard score to end the first half with a 17-7 lead. About halfway into the third quarter, freshman running back Raleek Brown scored on a 5-yard run, putting the Trojans up 24-7. Notre Dame answered with a 23-yard touchdown pass to sophomore wide receiver Deion Colzie to cut the lead back down to 24-14. 
A pair of touchdown runs from Williams and an interception from sophomore defensive back Calen Bullock clinched the victory for the Trojans, who ended their regular season with an 11-1 record.
“We have a rule about tak[ing] what is in front [of] you, and if it’s not there, then scan the field,” said Williams about his play style and going on these runs on his own. “It also reminds me that I am a little bit athletic, so sometimes take off.”
Other than Williams, there were many other key players and units that helped the Trojans get the win at the Coliseum, including senior running back Austin Jones, who now has an elevated role due to a season-ending injury to redshirt senior running back Travis Dye. The senior transfer from Stanford had 25 carries for 154 yards and now plays a prominent role in the Trojans’ dynamic offense. 
“Same thing as I said last week [against UCLA], no surprises,” said Head Coach Lincoln Riley about Jones’ performance. “Travis [Dye] and Austin [Jones] were 1A and 1B, and we are very fortunate to have some really good backs in there.”
Moreover, the defense had a relatively strong performance, despite allowing 27 points. Defensive linemen redshirt senior Solomon Byrd and junior Tuli Tuipulotu had key sacks on Notre Dame quarterback junior Drew Pyne, who completed 88 percent of his passes for 318 yards. When Notre Dame was threatening to score in their opening drive of the third quarter, senior Ralen Goforth recovered a fumble deep in USC territory. Finally, Bullock got a crucial interception toward the end of the game when the Fighting Irish were only down 10. These defensive efforts, along with limiting Notre Dame to only 90 yards rushing, shifted the momentum back to USC to ultimately hand them the win. 
“Defensively, honestly, kind of got sick and tired of hearing how well we were just going to get pounded in the run game. That didn’t happen,” said Riley about how the defense stepped up against the run game. “Really proud of the way we stopped the run, tackled, causing turnovers, and made big plays.”
Bullock said he was “very proud of the defense.” 
“We knew what type of game it was going to be,” said Bullock about the team’s efforts on the other side of the ball. “We knew they were going to try and come in here and thought they were going to out-physical us.” 
The Trojans are set to take on No. 124 Utah in the Pac-12 Championship at Las Vegas in a rematch of USC’s only loss this season. The teams will face off Friday at 5 p.m., with a potential College Football Playoff berth on the line for the now No. 4-ranked Trojans.
“I think we are as good as any team, and I am just not talking about today,” said Williams about his team’s potential and success this season as they prepare for the upcoming high-profile matchup against Utah. “The outside world is going to say what they have to say, and we are 11-1 right now … Whatever happens, is what is going to happen, but we got a game this week that we got to focus on.”

What if I told you about a program with years of poor seasons that recently hired a major head coach? Then, after an initial season of rebuilding, the transfer portal was utilized to reshape the roster with experienced players.
With all the new faces, the program had fresh hype. It was a more prosperous time, something unfamiliar to fans of the team in recent years. A strong start to the season followed the hype, reaffirming preseason beliefs.
No, this isn’t a column about football. It’s about the severely underrated women’s basketball team, which has had a similar turnaround.
Much of the conversation around USC Athletics has surrounded football, and rightfully so. A year ago, they finished 4-8 and are now sitting at 11-1 with a chance to make its first College Football Playoff.
The hiring of Lincoln Riley as head coach and elusive transfers such as sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams and redshirt senior running back Travis Dye stole the headlines. After a summer and fall camp with high hopes, the Trojans lived up to it.
But, if you look real close, the undefeated women’s basketball team is building something special too. We’ll get to the on-the-court play and transfers soon, since Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb and her staff just hit the biggest jackpot of the year — and no one is talking about it enough.  
The nationwide top recruit in the class of 2023, JuJu Watkins, committed to the Trojans earlier this month, shifting the landscape of women’s basketball at USC. She picked the Trojans over two staples of women’s college basketball — Stanford and the University of South Carolina.
Watkins is the third top-10 recruit to sign with the Trojans since 2007, two of which have come during Gottlieb’s tenure as head coach. Watkins is a two-time USA Basketball gold medalist and the reigning Gatorade Girls Basketball Player of the Year.
Simply put, she is one of the best high school girls’ basketball players of all time. Imagine coveted football recruit Arch Manning committing to the Trojans. OK, now times Manning’s status by ten. Now, it’s like JuJu. 
Yeah, it’s that big, even big enough to have a billboard set up at Galen Center announcing the commitment.
It’s a massive get for Gottlieb, who is in charge of rebuilding a program that has not made the NCAA Tournament since the 2013-14 season. Remember, this is a program that dominated the 1980s with four Final Four appearances and two National Championships. 
It won’t happen quickly, but Gottlieb has done something that previous coaches have been unable to do — recruit well and improve the product on the court.
The Trojans are currently undefeated, sitting at 6-0 for the first time since 2018 when they started 9-0. They’ve defeated teams with ease, beating teams by under 10 points just twice so far this season.
Coming into the season, USC had eight new transfers, including four graduate transfers, bolstering a roster that has only five players remaining from last season.
One of the best additions has been two grad transfers — forward Kadi Sissoko and guard Destiny Littleton. Sissoko is leading the Trojans with 17 points per game. Littleton, who came from the reigning national champion South Carolina Gamecocks, has scored in double digits in every game.
Last season’s Pac-12 All-Freshman team member guard Rayah Marshall has elevated her game, averaging 13 points and 10 rebounds a game so far, including a monster 19 points and 18 rebound game last week. 
The Trojans are clicking with a game that’s faster, an offense that’s smoother and a team that will make noise in the loaded Pac-12.
Gottlieb is a key part of all of this. She was a home run hire from the beginning, but now? It’s a grand slam, game-winning goal, buzzer-beater shot hire that has flown under the radar.
Her commitment to the program is second to none. After giving birth to her second child on Oct. 15, Gottlieb took just three weeks off and was back on the sidelines for opening night on Nov. 8. 
That’s a leader. That’s a coach. That’s somebody that’s going to lead this historically great women’s basketball program back to winning ways, competing for championships and filling arenas. 
Isn’t that just like what’s happening with the football team? Yeah, so let’s start paying attention as such.
