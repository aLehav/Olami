Ever had one of those days where you keep facing rejection? Susie Yankou, creator of the comedy web series 101 ways to get rejected, might be able to empathize. The USC student-created comedy web series, which has received more than 17,000 hits on Youtube, sheds light on the misadventures of what it’s like being a less-popular kid in high school. In addition to Yankou, a screenwriting major, the series also stars USC theater students Taylor Dearden, David Mandell, Grady Northrop and Alyssa Layne Overbeck.
Yankou, who loves writing comedic scripts as well as starring in comedy roles, had written a one-act play, a comedy about five friends set in an apartment. She had also written and starred in a 15-page comedy short film recently, called Stuck. But 101 ways is her first big project that she hopes will help get her name out there.
Set at the fictional Moore Park High School, each episode of 101 ways features different ways that these high school misfits get rejected by cooler, more popular kids. Sam, a more exaggerated version of Yankou, expresses insecurities and gets herself into sometimes awkward, sometimes embarrassing situations. The same can also be said about Dearden’s character, McKenzie, and her slightly-off but charming sense of humor. Then there’s Mandell who plays Smith, a happy-go-lucky but sometimes absent-minded guy,  and the “popular kids” played by  while Northrop and Overbeck.
Inspired by the frustration and chaos involved in getting ready for prom, Yankou wrote a monologue about the hyped high school experience. When she was thinking about a project to work on over the summer before college, this monologue came to mind. At the time, Yankou wasn’t too serious about expanding on this idea, since both time and content proved to be two major obstacles. But a friend agreed to help direct this series and soon 101 ways was born.
In addition to creating the show, Yankou also handled a number of other responsibilities, which included securing locations, organizing a production team and casting actors.
“I never knew I was capable of playing so many roles. 101 ways has taught me a lot,” said Yankou. “I had to leave my house at 7 in the morning, drive to the location for about an hour, and after filming for 10 straight hours, I had to come home and finish writing the script for the next episode.”
Despite the long nights, Yankou took away many lessons and memories from the whole experience. “One time, there was a scene in which Grady [Northrop] was supposed to kiss me.  So he had me against the locker, and we shared a very passionate kiss. Everyone was really happy with the take. But when he pulled away and said his line, his voice cracked, and all of us burst into laughter,” said Yankou. “Of course, we couldn’t use that shot.”
Even if you might not be able to identify with the characters of 101 ways, you definitely won’t be disappointed by the wit and humor in each episode.
New episodes of the web series come out every Thursday until the end of April, with a highly-anticipated prom episode marking the finale on April 25. You can watch these videos and more at: www.youtube.com/user/101waystogetrejected .
This sounds like a great idea for a web series. Looking forward to checking it out. Thanks for publishing this!
The article is good, also your journalist writes some good stuff…. The journo has a very good and an offbeat writing style which I think is a nice fit for the lifestyle section

The Figueroa Corridor Streetscape project, also known as MyFigueroa, will introduce the USC community to a newly designed Figueroa Street when completed in  2014.
The MyFigueroa project is an initiative led by the Los Angeles Department of Transportation and is being funded by a state grant from Proposition 1C funds.
The plan was voted on during an April 9 meeting held at the Andrew Norman Hall in the Los Angeles Orthopaedic Hospital.
Proposition 1C, which led to the Highway Safety, Traffic Reduction, Air Quality and Port Security Act of 2006, is a proposal that designates $1.35 billion for the development of urban areas and areas near public transportation. According to the grant’s stipulations, construction must be finished by the end of 2014.
Planners said the project will make travel down the Figueroa corridor safer for bicyclists and pedestrians while also encouraging residents to use more public transportation, such as the Metro Expo Line.
One of the project’s goals is to transform vehicle lanes into bicycle lanes. Currently, many of the bike lanes are separated from the road to enhance bicyclist safety. In addition, planners want to add platforms for public transit and install more lighting and trees to beautify the corridor.
The re-design will affect more than just the area surrounding campus. The three-mile stretch will impact Figueroa Street from 7th Street to Exposition Park, 11th Street from Figueroa to Broadway, and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard from Figueroa Street to Vermont Avenue.
Associate Senior Vice President of Civic Engagement for USC Craig Keys said the construction will greatly benefit students.
“[The project] is intended to make travel via bicycle safer and more convenient for bicycle users, and USC students are significant users of bicycle transportation,” Keys said. “It’ll impact them on a daily basis.”
Keys said the redesign also will allow students to go downtown and explore the city more easily.And in addition to greater access to other parts of Los Angeles, Keys emphasized that the project will increase overall traffic safer around campus.
“Safety is an issue right now with the major traffic on the Figueroa Corridor,” Keys said. “This [project] makes it safe for students to come onto campus for class, or to visit places in the community for shopping or recreation.”
The changes are also designed to have beneficial impacts on local businesses.
“The expectation is that this is going to invigorate the local economy because people who travel to shopping locations by bicycle and by foot tend to spend more money at their destinations and stay longer,” Keys said.
Some students, such as Yasmin Homayoun, a freshman majoring in business administration, said the reconstruction on Figueroa would encourage her to ride her bike more often, including toward Downtown Los Angeles.
“I think it’s a good idea, because I ride my bike all the time around campus,” Homayoun said. “It’s nice to know that they’re doing that.”
Others, such as Daniel Depew, a sophomore majoring in astronautical engineering, do not think the changes will make biking safe enough.
“Honestly, I don’t really use a lot of the bike lanes along the major streets. … I generally try to avoid the area,” he said. “It’s a safety thing for me about riding my bike along such a major thoroughfare. I usually take the side streets instead.”
Keys asserts that the university will be following the project closely to ensure that the needs of students and the administration will be met during the transition.
“We’re observing this progress and participating in the discussion,” Keys said. “If any issues arise which need to be addressed from the perspective of the project’s impact on students or issues related to the university’s activities, we’ll have an opportunity to address them.”
As of Tuesday afternoon, the MyFigueroa website does not list any scheduled lane closures. However, as construction begins, lane closures will likely occur soon.
“It’s not unusual for construction to be disruptive to transportation,” Keys said. “It would not be surprising if there was limited access along Figueroa.”
The planners did not give a definitive start day for construction.

Undergraduate Student Government unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday that urges the administration to increase funding to improve athletic recreational facilities and construct new facilities.
Spending · Senators vote to allocate funding Tuesday to improve recreational facitilies and create more space for students to work-out. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Senators hope money will go toward building a new recreational center or new recreational field in the The Village at USC, which is slated to be completed in 2019.
In January, more than 1,600 students signed a petition that called for more funds to be allocated to the Lyon Center and Recreational Sports. Greek Senator Logan Heley, one of the senators who sponsored the resolution, said these increased funds would allow for new athletic facilities to be built.
“We’re calling on the university to use the new University Village project to build a new recreation center and new field dedicated to recreation that will adequately accommodate the student body,” Heley said. “It’s time for USC to reassess the resources it allocates to student recreation to keep pace and stay ahead of other innovative universities.”
USG Director of Wellness Affairs Wiley Strahan and USG Assistant Director of Wellness Affairs A.J. Pinto authored the resolution. Strahan and Pinto collected the petition signatures and began working on a resolution to allocate more funds for students’ needs.
In the USG priority survey, which polled more than 500 students, the majority of students stressed the Lyon Center as their first priority for change on campus. Strahan said the resolution will be a much needed call for improvement.
“I have found that the areas in most disrepair are the places students spend most of their time, such as the Lyon Center, which is why I have been determined to get a resolution regarding student needs through the Senate,” Strahan said.
Those needs, according to the resolution, have drastically changed since the construction of the Lyon Center in 1989. At that time, nearly half of all undergraduates commuted and 90 percent of graduate students were commuters. Today, more students live on or near the campus compared to when the center was originally built.
“The Lyon Center was made when there was a significantly smaller amount of students living on campus,” Pinto said. “As USC increasingly becomes more of a residential college, the center has become increasingly outdated, and we must build a new center that accommodates the current student body.”
Pinto said there is no effective way to improve the current center; thus, the new project is crucial to solving the perceived problems of the Lyon Center and Recreational Sports on campus.
Furthermore, the fields on campus currently used for recreational sports are primarily devoted to the needs of the varsity and club athletes, often leaving other students without any facility to use. The resolution argues that a new space will alleviate stress and increase wellness among students.
USG also requests a meeting with university administrators, including Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett, Vice President for Real Estate Development and Asset Management Kristina Raspe and Senior Associate Director of Recreational Sports Justine Gilman.
Though the resolution only calls for a meeting, the authors want administrators to take action based on the requests of surveyed students.
“We’re really hoping that administrators will recognize the needs of our campus and will try harder to adequately accommodate those needs,” Pinto said.
How about more spending on critical LGBT&Q programming?

Seth Meyers captivated students by joking about the college experience during his first show in Los Angeles in Bovard Auditorium Tuesday night.
Live from Bovard· Saturday Night Live head writer and comedian Seth Meyers brings a weekday update to Bovard Auditorium on Tuesday. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
 
The event, which was hosted by the USC Speakers Committee, Performing Arts Committee, Political Student Assembly and Program Board, drew a crowd that lined up and down Trousdale Parkway from the front of Bovard to Jefferson Boulevard.
Meyers is best known for his success on the NBC’s Saturday Night Live, where he has been working for 10 seasons. This year marked his fifth season as head writer and anchor of the “Weekend Update” segment.
Before making his way to the SNL stage, he graduated from Northwestern University and later honed his skills at ImprovOlympic, a place where many SNL writers and actors have launched their careers.
When Meyers took the stage, he kept the audience erupting in laughter, even as he reminded everyone that flash photography was not allowed.
“If you use a flash, I can see it. I feel like people don’t think I can see that tiny pin of light in a sea of darkness on stage,” Meyers said. “It’s fine with me. I just want you to know given you’re college students.”
Meyers’ main material, however, focused on the lives of college students. Meyers had the audience out of its seats in laugher with jokes that were relatable to the students who made up the majority of the audience.
“My favorite thing was that he talked about futons and college hookup culture, [which was] very relatable and funny,” said Katie Lin, a sophomore majoring in business administration.
Some of Meyers’ other jokes touched on everything from the struggles of student debt, studying abroad, history and politics, Las Vegas bar fights and a peak at jokes that SNL censors in the past had not allowed him to use.
“I really liked it. The audience was super great and everyone was enjoying it and that made it even better,” said Ben Preston, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering. “My favorite was his routine about languages and if he got stabbed in France the only thing he could say in French was his name and to ask his killer ‘How are you?’”
Even students were not familiar with Meyers previously found the event amusing.
“It was really funny because I didn’t really know Seth Meyers. I just knew it was SNL, and I love SNL,” said Christel Tiu, a junior majoring in business administration. “I loved the part when he was talking about the towel. I found him relatable but, because I am international student, some of the stuff about politics I didn’t understand as well.”
Unlike a lot of the crude humor that is popular today Meyers referenced current and historical events.
“I was actually surprised because I thought his comedy was more slapstick, but it turns out he talked a lot more about politics,” said Daniela Cheng, a junior majoring in business administration and accounting.
Many students said Meyers lived up to their expectations. Shivangi Bhatnagar, a junior majoring in industrial and systems engineering who was also among the first student to line up, staked out her spot at 2 p.m. that afternoon.
“I was so excited,” Bhatnagar said, “Some of my friends and I have been watching his videos for the past two months.”

Junior Ray Sarmiento became the fifth Trojan to earn Pac-12 men’s player of the week honors this season after helping the No. 4 Trojans sweep No. 43 Oregon and defeat No. 33 Washington 6-1 last weekend.
Focused on the future · Junior Ray Sarmiento (above) will look to continue his strong play in USC’s final regular season match against UCLA before heading off to the Pac-12 championships, which begin April 23. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Ranked No. 14 in singles, Sarmiento defeated Oregon’s Jeff Mullen 6-2, 6-3 on Friday and Washington’s Marton Bots 6-1, 6-2 on Saturday. The wins extended his singles win streak to 11 and improved his solo record to 26-5 overall and 15-3 in dual match play.
Sarmiento’s victory over Mullen also gave the Trojans a 4-0 lead and served as the clincher over the Ducks.
Sarmiento also paired up with sophomore Yannick Hanfmann to register doubles wins in both matches. The No. 32-ranked pair took down Oregon’s Robin Cambier and Mullen, 8-3 and Washington’s Kyle McMorrow and Bots 8-2.
This is Sarmiento’s fifth career conference player of the week award after earning the honor twice in 2011 and twice in 2012. Sarmiento now joins junior Emilio Gomez, sophomores Hanfmann and Roberto Quiroz, and freshman Max de Vroome as Pac-12 men’s players of the week this season.
Sarmiento has peaked as high as No. 9 this year after concluding the 2012 season ranked No. 25 in singles. This season, Sarmiento has played primarily at the first and second courts in singles. Sarmiento is 7-3 when playing on court one and 8-0 when on court two.
In doubles play, Sarmiento and Hanfmann have gone 13-5 overall and 11-4 in dual matches and have won four in a row.
With ITA player of the year Steve Johnson graduating from USC last season, Sarmiento and Gomez emerged as the leaders of a USC squad seeking its fifth consecutive NCAA championship.
The two victories over the Ducks and Huskies extended USC’s win streak to 10 games and improved the Trojans to 22-2 overall and 5-0 in conference play. USC will now travel to Westwood to face UCLA, also undefeated in Pac-12 play, in the regular-season finale on Friday at 3 p.m.

Last weekend I wandered into The Artform Studio in the Downtown Arts District. It doubles as a record store and a place to get a haircut, which sounds like a strange combination, but it works.
As Stevie Wonder belted out “Do I Do” on an old-school cassette player, I explored every inch of the studio’s expansive record collection. The walls were littered with classic album covers from some of the best soul singers and rappers of all time.
I knew I would never actually use any of the records, but I purchased Al Green’s Call Me anyway, mostly because it was seven bucks but also because the photos of a sweaty Green strutting around in leather pants made me laugh.
But there was another album cover I almost bought instead. It featured a picture of Marvin Gaye, though not the image most associated with the R&B crooner famous for his “Sexual Healing.” Instead, Gaye looks subdued — saddened, even — as raindrops fall on his head. The record holds some of his greatest hits, as he preached about a wide range of topics relevant to the late ’60s and early ’70s.
In the wake of the horrific bombing that occurred at the Boston Marathon on Monday — leaving at least three dead and more than 144 injured — I find myself unable to shake that album from my thoughts. On “Mercy, Mercy Me,” Gaye sings about all that is ominous around him.
“Where did all the blue skies go?” He asks. “Poison is the wind that blows from the north, east, south and sea. Oh mercy, mercy me.”
Those lyrics might not seem so pertinent in relation to this tragedy, but how exactly does one quantify something so terrible? The pictures and videos that quickly flooded the Internet are beyond explanation.
One particular image of a man in a wheel chair, leg blown to bits, sticks out to me. He’s pushed forward by three determined adults who are trying their hardest to ignore the obvious — that this man’s leg is beyond repair. It appears he grasps the situation but hasn’t fully processed it. The look of disappointment, of opportunities senselessly lost, seems to hit him all at once. And for whatever reason, the overwhelming sadness I feel for this poor individual can only be expressed by a Marvin Gaye song that replays over and over in my head.
Events like the Boston marathon are meant to bring a group of people together. Really, that’s the point of any sports venue — for fans to participate, cheer, watch and engage in something that can unite us all. There are very few things left on this planet with such a poignant effect.
And that’s what makes this terrorist attack all the more disturbing. Sports are supposed to be a safe haven of competition and camaraderie. The finish line is sacred ground. In this case, it served as a killing ground.
It’s remarkable how quickly those on the scene turned from marathon runners to heroes. Consider the circumstances — when the explosions occurred, participants had just completed a 26-mile course. I’m in decent enough shape and try to play pickup basketball a few times a week, and I’d struggle to make 26 miles in a day, let alone a few hours. Yet some of these runners — after exhausting themselves all afternoon — kept running, all the way to local hospitals to donate blood to the victims.
So that’s what I keep telling myself, and I hope others find strength in the heroic actions of such a brave group of men, women and children. In times of hardship, citizens of all different backgrounds came together to help those in need. The sheer number of kind-hearted, empathetic people at the Boston marathon far outnumbered the soulless coward (or cowards) responsible for these terrorist attacks.
In the coming weeks, more harsh realities will come to light. Some of the injured will recover. Some, unfortunately, will not. Politicians will use the incident to push their own agendas. Conspiracy theorists will continue to spew nonsense to test the patience of a grieving group of people.
But through it all, I have no doubt the city of Boston will persevere. It has the full support of the entire country, and its citizens showed signs of true courage in the moments immediately after the two bombs went off.
“How much more abuse from man can you stand?” 
Gaye asks this question at the end of “Mercy, Mercy Me.” It’s a valid uncertainty to have. These violent acts are hard to swallow; they directly and indirectly affect the lives of thousands.
Sometimes our collective faith in humanity is tested, but I’d refer anyone whose confidence is shaken to the men and women who rushed to the aid of the injured. They are a reflection of our humanity, and that humanity is capable of absorbing this sort of senseless abuse to eventually emerge stronger.

Was Mister Rodgers an “old white republican”  that Professor Sragow spoke about?
I know nothing of the political leanings of Mr. Fred Rogers, but if you’ll pardon my generalizing, he seemed far to caring for the whole of humanity to be a Republican.
Just sayin’.
“When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, ‘Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.’ To this day, especially in times of ‘disaster,’ I remember my mother’s words, and I am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers – so many caring people in this world.” — Mister Rogers

On a blustery Tuesday in Los Angeles, a pair of long fly balls caught the wind and carried the Trojans to a 5-2 victory.
In their first road win during the week, the Trojans seemed to right a lot of wrongs that have, for most of the season, been weighing them down.

“I thought this was a great job of coming back after a real tough loss on Sunday, a game we felt like we could’ve and should’ve won,” USC head coach Dan Hubbs said.  “To come back and get this win was huge.”
USC (14-22) traveled across town to face Loyola Marymount (18-18) for a midweek, 3 p.m. matchup in its first of eight consecutive road games. The Trojans aimed to rebound from twin losses against No. 15 Arizona State despite USC’s late scramble to slate a starter.
In their previous meeting earlier this season, the Trojans battled their way through a pitcher’s duel, ultimately beating the Lions by a slim 2-1 margin. This time, USC headed into the bottom of the ninth with an uncharacteristically comfortable buffer and completed a two-game season sweep.
Hubbs, who said Monday that he didn’t know who would start the game, settled on sending freshman Brent Wheatley to the mound. Wheatley started against the Lions in the team’s February matchup and tossed five scoreless innings.
On Friday, when he was pressed with finding starters to replace injured junior Bob Wheatley, Hubbs prepared to send out a tag team of relievers to carry the team. Instead, junior Sean Silva (who was recently named Pac-12 pitcher of the week) and Brent Wheatley pitched a combined  one-hitter against Arizona State.
But on Tuesday, five pitchers contributed to the USC victory. Four of those five were freshmen, apparently ready to shed their rookie statuses and help improve the team’s last-place ERA in the  Pac-12 conference.
Brent Wheatley was on a shorter leash and allowed only one earned run in two innings of work before passing the ball to a couple of pitchers who have been struggling to find their commands.
Freshman Marc Huberman entered the game with a 9.53 ERA, having given up 12 runs in only 11.1 innings. Similarly, senior Matt Munson was posting a 10.34 ERA, with 18 earned runs in his 15.2 innings of work.
The two pitchers found their grooves, though, combining for four scoreless innings of relief.
“Huberman’s been scuffling a little bit so it was nice to see him have a good, clean inning,” Hubbs said. “And then Mudson threw three really good innings that we needed desperately.”
Freshman Brooks Kriske put up a pair of scoreless frames and freshman Kyle Twomey allowed a last-chance run before shutting down the Lions for good.
On offense, the Trojans initially showed signs of repeating their worn-out habit of threatening to score but being unable to execute. Two early singles from hot-hitting freshman shortstop Blake Lacey and senior left-fielder Greg Zebrack were immediately matched with a pair of strikeouts. Even a walk to load the bases was all for naught.
But a slow start at the plate was short-lived, and the Trojans were able to remedy their two pitfalls: failing to respond after giving up runs and hitting with runners in scoring position.
Immediately after Wheatley allowed a run on a groundball RBI, USC answered with a couple of hits off the bats of seasoned junior hitters James Roberts and Kevin Swick. The pressure was on Zebrack, who defied the implausible with a two-strike, two-out RBI single to tie the game at one.
And the offensive feats didn’t stop there. The big swings of the bat that would end up dictating the outcome of the game were delivered in the top of the sixth inning by Jake Hernandez and freshman right-fielder Vahn Bozoian. The two scorched twin home runs that seemed to follow similar trajectories and set off a domino effect that enabled USC to flex offensive muscles it didn’t know it had.
Also worth noting: standout freshmen Lacey and Timmy Robinson kept their hitting streaks alive. Hopefully, a couple more Trojans can contribute streaks of their own in the upcoming long road stretch.
“I’m expecting Utah to be tough. They’re similar to us,” Hubbs said. “They’re in every game and they’ve found ways to not win some of them, but they’ve been close games.”
The team will head first to Utah on Friday before facing Oregon State and Pepperdine next week.

As one Cooper moved out, another moves in.
Cynthia Cooper-Dyke is back home, and the USC hall of famer was formally introduced Tuesday as the new women’s basketball head coach in a reception at the Galen Center.
Settling in · Cooper-Dyke was formally introduced as USC’s head coach on Tuesday after coaching for eight years and compiling a combined 150-106 record at Prairie View A&M University, UNC Wilmington and Texas Southern. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Surrounded by many of her former teammates, new players, coaches and alumni, Cooper-Dyke took the stage with a feeling of excitement in the air after Athletic Director Pat Haden welcomed her back to the USC campus.
“If you had asked me years ago when I began coaching what was my dream and where I wanted to be, I wanted to be home, here at USC,” Cooper-Dyke said.
Cooper-Dyke, 49, opened by expressing her enthusiasm for finally being able to lead her alma mater and thanked Haden and the rest of the athletic department for “getting it right this time.”
And after only one practice with the team, the former WNBA and international superstar had plenty of great things to say about her roster.
“My team is a fantastic and wonderful group of very talented young women,” Cooper-Dyke said. “I look forward to working with them in order to build confidence and build a culture [with] an attitude of winning.”
A winning attitude in the women’s basketball program is nothing new to USC, as Haden expressed in his introduction.
“We have a long history of really good women’s basketball teams along with a history of national championships, and Cynthia was a very important figure on those national championships teams,” Haden said. “We are so thrilled to have her leading our program … back to greatness.”
Cooper-Dyke is what Haden believes to be a “Trojan icon,” as she is one of the greatest players to ever play basketball at USC on either the men’s or women’s side. Haden also mentioned how her number 44 jersey is currently retired in the Galen Center and how she has accomplished virtually everything one can in the sport of basketball.
“We think she is going to be a terrific coach for our Trojan basketball team,” Haden said.
After turning other collegiate programs into winning teams during her eight-year coaching career and going 150-106 (.586) during that time, Cooper-Dyke looks to accomplish the same feat at USC.
“I’m excited to get started and really put USC women’s basketball where we deserve to be,” Cooper-Dyke said.
After talking about how she couldn’t have imagined accomplishing so much during her basketball career, Cooper-Dyke expressed how this position in particular is something she never fathomed.
“It was always my dream to come back to Los Angeles and be at the helm of USC women’s basketball,” Cooper-Dyke said.
The four-time WNBA champion also brings a new coaching style to the Women of Troy, and she shared how she has learned from her coaching experiences thus far.
“I have learned how to break things that I wanted to teach down however far I needed to in order for my players to get it,” Cooper-Dyke said. “It is my job as a head coach to teach them, and it is so gratifying to see when a player gets it and see them demonstrate that out on the court.”
Even after one practice,  Cooper-Dyke’s coaching style already seems to resonate well with the players.
“She has a great sense of humor, has tons of energy and also is an alumni … so it is really easy to relate with her,” rising senior forward Cassie Harberts said. “She is so passionate and literally bleeds cardinal and gold.”
Another important member of this season’s squad agreed with Harberts’ assertion.
“She’s really easy to talk to and is very open,” junior Ariya Crook said. “She’s also a teaching coach, so if we had any questions, she stopped and helped us get through what we wanted to get through.”
Toward the end of the press conference, Cooper-Dyke fittingly stressed the importance of one of her main goals, which is to get to know her players and for her players to get to know her.
“It’s not about what happened in the past — rather, it’s about what we are going to do in the future, and this is my team’s time,” Cooper-Dyke said.
When talking about the team’s playing style, Cooper-Dyke mentioned how the Women of Troy are going to emphasize defense, get up and down the court and play a fun-to-watch style of basketball. However, for Cooper and the rest of the women’s program, it all comes down to one thing.
“The main goal is to win,”  Cooper-Dyke said. “We want  to be on top of the Pac-12 and become a national powerhouse again.”

A good song is like a good book — both are able to transport you to a totally awesome world of wonder and impossibility … at least for a few minutes.
The best songs are the ones in which you can actually feel the energy, the mystery or the fun of what the artist is trying to express. It’s really pretty amazing how a series of manipulations of instruments and computer buttons can create an entire world of its own, resonating with people everywhere.
Luckily, many musicians are great at executing this, including those featured in this week’s New Noise.
Whether it’s dark, light, homegrown or somber, these new tracks are examples of bands that use music to create an aural world of epic proportions.
LVMRKS: “Valentine”
After Neil Busch left powerhouse psychedelic post-punk outfit …And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead in 2004, fans of the band’s early sound wondered what would become of idiosyncratic styles of both Trail of Dead as a group and Busch himself, as his bass, vocals and songwriting were instrumental to the band’s foundation.
Fast forward nine years later, and all can rest assured that both are doing just fine. Trail of Dead just released its eighth studio album last October, and Busch has been keeping busy throughout the years with his own projects, including his latest venture, LVMRKS.
The supergroup features Busch on vocals, guitars and keyboards, Dave Clifford (Red Sparowes, The VSS) on drums and Jonathan Hischke (Broken Bells, Hella) on bass.
The band’s debut album, Pale Fairytale, is set to be released in May. The album’s sound is dramatic and gothic, with black metal styles and solid guitar riffs making up a majority of the songs.
“Valentine,” one of the album’s singles, is one of the more upbeat tracks from Pale Fairytale — the song builds up like a sea of guitars pushing against a 15-watt amp before it finally blows up, making for some nice suspense. There’s an early Trail of Dead sound in the music and fans of that band will definitely dig Busch’s new project.

Monks of Mellonwah: “Sky and the Dark Night, Part 2 — Control”
These Sydney-based alt-rockers are starting to make waves in the indie-rock scene. The band has already won awards from Artists In Music and the LA Music Awards, and its early EPs garnered critical acclaim.
The band is planning to tour later this year, and its latest single presents a more experimental direction than heard in previous songs. “Sky and the Dark Night” is an eight-minute-long song that literally takes the listener on an intense journey of ups, downs, speeds and stops.
Experiencing to the entire eight-minute long single is like reading a chapter of a book — there is a clear story complete with an introduction, a conflict, a climax and a denouement (and violins!). The second part of the (mini-)epic song is “Control,” a heavy tune with dark and enigmatic undertones.
Regarding the inspiration for the track, lead guitarist Joe de la Hoyde told the media: “We are each riddled by our own curses and battle our own demons. There are diseases and syndromes, and many things that we can’t understand, let alone hope to control. ‘Sky And The Dark Night,’ to me, is the journey from the beginning of our battles to their fruitless ends; the ups and downs, the triumphs and the failures. It is the undying hope that maybe somewhere along the way, we might find ourselves.”
So basically, if there could be a soundtrack to epiphanies, “Sky and the Dark Night” would probably be on there somewhere.

MY WOSHIN MASHIN: “They Live”
After all of your catalysts and epiphanies have dropped courtesy of Monks of Mellonwah, you’ll probably want a sip or 10 of something to bump up your mood.
Well, My Woshin Mashin is here to save the day. The Russian-German band has a unique blend of electro-dance-punk/synth-pop-on-crack music that Russian Billboard magazine actually described as being “better than amphetamine.” Now, that’s pretty legit.
Bibi Tulin’s also got a voice that is most likely one in seven billion and My Woshin Mashin was officially born after she partnered up with her friends Hugo Simons and Wolfgang Scherman (who apparently wears a crocodile mask because, well, you have to when your name is as awesome as “Wolfgang Scherman”).
April 30 is the day the band drops its debut album, succinctly titled EVIL MUST DIE, and “They Live” is the third track of debauchery featured on the record. Talk about moods – “They Live” will most definitely make you wonder where you left your head. The song delves into a universe of intricately controlled chaos, with menacing synth riffs bouncing along to a hard beat that forces your body to start moving.
After the song is over, you’ll probably be left wondering what you accidentally spiked your drink with, but don’t worry — it’s just My Woshin Mashin making your day.

Slim Loris: “Visions of Tomorrow”
We already made one pretty sharp turn with My Woshin Mashin, so let’s keep up the total lack of direction and head over to Slim Loris territory.
You know that saying “If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, looks like a duck, it must be a duck”? Well, Slim Loris is here to prove us all wrong.
The band looks and sounds like a homegrown, national treasure of bona fide Americana. The guitars twang in all the right places and the drums play all the right beats. This is where a band’s creation of an atmosphere and a different world offered to the listener comes into play. But though Slim Loris is straight up Easy Rider music, the dudes are from Sweden.
The band’s second album is titled Future Echoes and Past Replays and is set to drop on May 19. “Visions of Tomorrow” is a perfect example of the American classic-rock sound and ’60s stylings of the band’s music. Instead of being futuristic with embellished production, “Visions of Tomorrow” is simple and effective, and Slim Loris flawlessly captures the sound of a geographic region in the music.
Take a listen and be prepared to throw that duck theory out the window.

There has never been a shortage of criticism over the Kardashian family’s fame. The family is viewed worldwide as being beautiful, entertaining and, well, talentless.
Famous ties · Brandon Jenner and Leah Felder of Brandon and Leah decided against building their brand around their families’ fame. – Courtesy of Rogers & Cowan
 
The most talented member of the family, ironically, is probably also the least recognized. But Brandon Jenner, son of Olympian Bruce Jenner and brother of reality star Brody Jenner, is the lead guitarist for the musical duo known as Brandon and Leah, which released its first EP Cronies on April 9.
Interestingly enough, Leah Felder, the voice accompanying Jenner’s guitar, also comes from a famous family. Her father, Don Felder, was the lead guitarist for The Eagles. Felder inherited her father’s musical abilities but, like Jenner, passed on the opportunity to build her brand around her family name.
“We came down our own path. We don’t want to live in the shadow of our parents,” Felder said. “We don’t want to depend on others. It’s more gratifying to be our own people.”
Of course, Jenner is quick to add that he is not opposed to mixing family with business. After all, Felder is married to Jenner and it is a pleasant surprise to find that their relationship is as heartwarming as their music.
“It’s fun!” said Jenner in reference to working creatively with his wife. “It’s not whoever wins the fistfight makes all the decisions — we work together on everything.”
They are both on the same page when it comes to creating music, which is rare for a young pair of aspiring artists.
“We would both love to be in control, but we work better together when we play nicely,” Felder said with a chuckle.
When they first met at 11 years old, Felder was just a friend of Jenner’s younger brother Brody. As they got older, they each played with different bands, bouncing from group to group.
“Music came first. The sparks weren’t there yet, and we both had significant others,” Jenner said.
But the sparks eventually ignited, and the two started dating. They fell in love and eight years later, they were married in a private ceremony in Hawaii.
Almost a year after their wedding, their musical career is finally starting to take off with the band’s first EP, Cronies.
“This album is a long time coming,” Jenner said. “It’s our first real release, not just a single.”
A long time coming is an understatement. Despite the duo’s musical talent and undeniable good looks, the path to its first album release has been anything but smooth.
“Four years ago we signed with Warner Brothers, but we never released anything,” Jenner said. “We got off [the label] and connected with Red Light Management.”
Abandoning a record label is a risky move for relatively unknown artists. But both Jenner and Felder were determined to do it their own way, and they agree that the freedom to pursue music on their own terms is much more valuable than a recording contract.
“We were able to focus on the organic nature of our sound,” Felder said. “After that, we were able to just put our heads down and focus.”
Since opting for independence from Warner Brothers, the duo has been able to put out multiple music videos. The video for the song “Vaseline” is their most elaborate effort and, as a result, is easily their best. The Western-themed video includes all three of the Jenner brothers while still maintaining focus on a main strength of the duo: Felder’s seductive voice.
The music video for “Vaseline” shows that the duo have serious potential as artists. With a successful release of Cronies, the couple’s popularity could explode.
“This album is about finding the right songs to act as a window into our future,” Felder said.
The band has garnered attention and a small fan base by playing live sets in small venues around Los Angeles and on cruise ships. The casual listener would probably recognize the duo’s most successful song to date, “Showstopper,” which serves as the theme song for Kim and Kourtney Take Miami.
With this kind of publicity, it would be easy to think that the band has finally made it big, but Felder disagreed with that sentiment.
“There is never really a moment where you feel like you made it. It’s a continual process,” Felder said.
Cronies showcases Brandon and Leah’s talents not only as musicians but as songwriters. Delving into their Malibu roots and pulling from the intricacies of their experiences with success and defeat, the album has plenty to offer for listeners.
“Its not easy — it’s work!” Felder said. “But it’s incredible having him with me, experiencing the lows and highs together.”

Imagine it’s 11 a.m. and you’re walking through Chinatown: All around you, a host of men and women push metal carts loaded with all sorts of culinary curiosities.
You can’t see some of the food held in metal containers, but their smells waft through the room as cart after cart passes by your table. Eventually, someone stops and asks what items you want to indulge in next, and with every new dish you get more and more full until the food coma hits.
That’s the experience of sampling dim sum, a Chinese food staple normally reserved for the brunch hours. Los Angeles has a thriving dim sum scene and you can find plenty of dim sum restaurants throughout the city.
But one hotspot lies right near campus — Chinatown. The cultural space greets visitors with plenty of stores and a sprinkling of galleries as well as restaurants as far as the eye can see — many of them dim sum eateries.
To help you explore the offerings of the many dim sum eateries in that area, the Dim Sum Crawl will offer Angelenos the chance to try dim sum items with unique beer pairings. Sponsored by the Los Angeles Chinatown Business Improvement District, the event takes place Thursday, April 18, from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. Tickets go for $60 and you can only buy them until midnight tonight; that admission gets you samplings from four restaurants and four breweries.
The restaurant list includes Empress Pavilion paired with Noble Ale Works, Mandarin Chateau with Eagle Rock Brewery, Hop Woo with Kinetic Brewing Company and Plum Tree Inn with Craftsman Brewing.
“We wanted to do this to let people sample the different dim sum restaurants in Chinatown,” said Linh Ho, principal of Ideation Agency, who helped plan the event. “People know it’s known for dim sum but it’s hard to find which one to go to, so we wanted to curate all the dim sum and create a menu where people can really explore options besides just dumplings.”
Eagle Rock Brewery was the first onboard, and founder Ting Su invited others to join the fun. The restaurants were chosen based on what they offered best. Dim sum eating usually happens in the morning but the beer pairings transformed the event into a nighttime one. That might seem strange for some restaurants, but they’re all for the event.
“They’re not used to serving dim sum at night, some of them, and then we’re also looking at a pretty good-sized crowd, so I think to serve that many people at night, logistically it will be different than what they’re used to,” Ho said. “But everyone has been very supportive with the idea and we had people ask us before to do dim sum events in Chinatown, so it seems like an obvious thing we should do and we’re glad we’re finally able to do it this year.”
The event requires you to get a little more risky in your eating, but that might pay off for fans of the non-traditional.
“The people that go to this event will be foodies that are a little bit more adventurous,” Ho said. “We want to appeal to people that love dim sum but that also have an adventurous spirit — those that are willing to try things outside of the regular dim sum repertoire.”
That means the normal offerings of fried vegetables and dumplings but also more out-of-the-ordinary treats, including a beer float the end of the night.
“This is also a progressive dinner,” Ho said. “We start with smaller bites and as the evening rolls on it gets a little bit heavier and at the end of the night we’ll have had a savory meal, but we’ll also have a beer float. It’s gonna be French toast with ice cream with beer from Craftsman Brewing.”
After that, the afterparty will take place at Grand Star Jazz Club. This is the first event of its kind in Chinatown, so it naturally warrants a celebration afterward. Participants also get a souvenir glass to take home as their trophy for a long night of eating and drinking.
Ho just has two very important tips for Dim Sum Crawl-goers:
“Bring your appetite. Bring some walking shoes.”
Gee, Thanks for waiting until the last minute to publish this story.
You’ve made it so we ONLY can purchase the highest price option.
I don’t drink, and never could stand the taste of beer, but if I could have bought the $40 tickets, I could justify the cost. But at $60 x a date = $120 and neither of us drink, the price is too steep.
Thanks anyway

Ugandan parliament is currently debating a bill that would prohibit women from wearing miniskirts in public, according to a Los Angeles Times article published Monday.
Though it might seem antiquated for those with Western ideals, such laws are common in countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, in which women must be covered from head to toe in public.
But even though democratically elected politicans have earned the right to create laws, Uganda’s proposed miniskirt ban not only imposes upon freedom of personal expression but calls into question the values and ethics behind dress code policies worldwide.
Under the guise of limiting indecent exposure, the proposed law targets women and limits freedom of expression. Uganda’s Minister of Ethics and Integrity, James Nsaba Buturo, equated miniskirts with nudity in an interview with the BBC. He used this exaggeration to hold scantily-clad women responsible for distracting drivers and “enticing” rape.
Instead of addressing the issue of sexual crime in Uganda, Buturo plans to ban thigh-bearing skirts because he feels they “provoke” these crimes. This flawed logic exemplifies the rape culture that blames victims while simultaneously pardoning their attackers.
Citizens of the United States are lucky enough to not have to live under national laws dictating skirt length. However, local dress codes, especially in schools, can still infringe upon First Amendment rights. The First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech and non-verbal expression, yet certain institutions use dress codes to limit this right.
By forcing students to wear similar clothes, schools constrict creative expression and promote homogeneity. In addition, dress codes impose a standard of decency on students that only reflects the policymakers’ perspective. They force a standardized version of acceptable dress that does not take student opinion into account. Similarly, they neglect to consider the influence the fashion industry has on the availability of certain clothing and any cultural biases against donning merely “appropriate” attire.
Aside from the basic laws related to indecent public exposure, safety (such as closed-toed shoes being required at the gym) and the media’s censorship of nudity, federal and state law does not dictate clothing choices. Consequently, schools should also not limit students’ fashion choices by imposing strict clothing guidelines. Most institutionally sanctioned dress codes are instated to prohibit offensive or lewd forms of dress.  But, as with Uganda, the schools generally have more pressing matters to attend to.
For example, a school might ban certain colored clothing because it is emblematic of a local gang. This policy reflects only a topical solution to the underlying problem of gang violence. Instead of restricting liberties, the real issue of gang violence could be addressed through reform programs.
Fashion is a form of personal visual communication that allows people to express themselves non-verbally. This liberty of expression should be considered a basic human right.
According to the United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19, “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression.”
National precedent is even more definitive. In 1969, the Des Moines Independent School Distict attempted to prohibit students from wearing black arm bands in protest of the Vietnam War. School officials justified their actions by claiming these arm bands were a form of negative propaganda.       The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the students, upholding their fashion choice as a form of self-expression and peaceful protest under the First Amendment. In this instance, fashion spoke louder than words.
Though dress codes themselves are not wrong, the intention behind them should be evaluated. If, in the case of Uganda, the policy stems from a misguided attempt to address sexual assault, the policy should not be taken seriously.
Fashion is not a remedy for larger issues such as gang violence or sexual assault crimes. Instead of regulating clothing choices, energy should be put toward fixing the underlying problem.   Clothing choice, after all, is a powerful and non-intrusive means of verbal expression — one which should be universally guaranteed and protected.

For many, two dollars might seem like a trifling amount — or at least nothing to argue over. But in the case of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum at the World Trade Center in New York City, it’s a different story.
The memorial foundation’s recent announcement that a temporary two-dollar service fee for visitors wishing to make their reservations in advance has caused something of an uproar, Politico reports.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
Though continuing to charge such a fee with the goal of turning a significant profit would be wrong — not to mention an insult to the victims whose lives the memorial seeks to commemorate — the foundation should not be vilified for its attempt to keep the patriotic memorial operating until further funding arrives.
The memorial opened in 2011 and has since drawn more than seven million visitors seeking to pay tribute to the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and Shanksville, Pa., as well as to the six individuals who died in the World Trade Center bombing of 1993.
Since its creation, the foundation in charge of the memorial and upcoming museum at the World Trade Center site has raked in more than $430 million in private donations, according to The New York Post. Additionally, about $295 million in taxpayer-funded grants received from 2006 to 2011 were applied to cover construction costs, according to the Post.
However, the museum that was meant to be a supplement to the memorial failed to open on time because of a funding fight between the foundation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the 16-acre site that houses the memorial. This fight has purportedly interfered with the foundation’s financial planning, necessitating the controversial service fee, according to Politico.
Additionally, the foundation has stated that operating the memorial and museum will cost at least $60 million annually. Security will require an estimated $12 million, while an extra $5 million will go just toward operating the waterfall tributes there, according to the Post.
Despite the clearly high costs of constructing, operating and maintaining a safe and beautiful memorial space for honoring victims, people have expressed outrage over what they see as greedy, unpatriotic executives capitalizing on the unspeakable tragedy of 9/11.
Said one mother of a victim to the Post: “I don’t want the American public to have to pay a dime to pay respects to my son.”
And Jim Riches, a retired FDNY deputy chief and father of a fallen fireman at the World Trade Center in 2001, stated that the memorial should be free and that “you wouldn’t charge money to get into a cemetery.”
Riches is mostly correct in saying this, but the 9/11 memorial is obviously not the same as a normal cemetery. One only needs to gaze at the two giant waterfalls and reflecting pools measuring about an acre each, with the names of the victims inscribed in beautiful bronze.
It is understandable that people would consider the memorial foundation’s newly imposed charges to be a callous attempt to extract profit from tragedy, and any future charges should be heavily scrutinized. A foundation running such a significant memorial dedicated to the fallen victims of unspeakable terror should never use these national tragedies for financial gain, or for anything other than honoring and perpetuating the memory of those taken from us too soon by cowardly acts of violence.
At the same time, however, just because the memorial exists does not mean that it will always be able to run smoothly without any funding from the multitudes of visitors that will continue to visit in the years ahead.
Ultimately, a temporary two-dollar service fee is a small price to pay for such a beautiful public display of honor and remembrance for those who died.

How in the H, E, double hockey sticks…………… is this topic even in a column????     *There’s no fee charged to visit the vietnam memorial wall in DC,  cemeteries don’t charge fee’s to visit the memorials of those that have passed on!
No fee’s should be charged to visit the 911 memorial! They receive plenty of donations, all their doing is taking advantage of an emotional public!!!!!

There are times in life when we are no longer divided by a city, but united by our nation. Yesterday was one of those times.
When two explosions went off at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three and injuring over 100 people, Americans were stunned and in disbelief.
How could this happen? Who would do such a thing? Why? What motives could someone have to take innocent lives?
We still don’t have answers, and it seems every question has created another. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said that the event “appears to be a cruel act of terror,” but even that’s not definitive.
Regardless of how we classify the tragic event, there were signs that the positive outweighs the negative in this world, and that most people think of this act as despicable and intolerable.
When the explosion went off, most people naturally ran away from it to take cover. Except for first responders, who immediately rushed to the aid of those in danger. Those brave civilians ran toward smoke and fire to save lives.
Others on site rushed to donate blood at hospitals. Millions of people across the country looked for any way they could help, and showed their support on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social media platforms.
President Barack Obama demanded justice for those responsible for this unthinkable act. So do almost all Americans.
There were similar selfless acts in the world of sports.
The NBA canceled tonight’s game between the Boston Celtics and Indiana Pacers, which was to be held in Boston. Since the regular season ends Wednesday, the teams won’t reschedule another game and will instead finish with 81 games played instead of the regular 82.
Last night’s NHL game between the Boston Bruins and Ottawa Senators was postponed, and a rescheduled game has not been announced yet. No other major sporting events have been canceled.
Several pictures from New York were posted that had projections on walls and buildings saying “NY hearts Boston,” which speaks to the intense sports rivalry the cities have with each other, and how in pressing times none of that matters.
A similar act occurred in the Chicago Tribune, as it inserted the phrase “We are Chicago” in front of all of the Boston sports teams (i.e. “We are Chicago” Celtics, “We are Chicago” Red Sox, etc.), as an ode to Beantown.
Hundreds of athletes sent out empathic tweets and re-tweeted the phone numbers of helplines. Different athletes pledged to donate a certain amount of money depending on their statistical accolades next year. The outpour was enormous, as it should’ve been.
Tragedies reveal the cruelty of the world, but they also expose its courage and compassion.
There are more good people than bad people on the planet; it’s just that the actions of the bad can affect thousands or millions of the good. In a perfect world, there would be no terrorism or devastation. But our world is far from perfect. Still, it’s how we respond that matters most.
The toughest times show America’s true character, and if yesterday is any indication, we should be proud to be Americans.

Before the bombing of the 2013 Boston Marathon was even twenty-four hours old, conspiracy theories littered Facebook feeds and Google searches. The attack, which occurred on Monday in downtown Boston, was a series of two explosions located on the sidelines near the finish line of the race. CBS News reports that a third explosive was discovered and properly disposed.
Within hours, well-known conspiracy theorist Alex Jones tweeted about the bombing.
“Our hearts go out to those that are hurt or killed #Boston marathon – but this thing stinks to high heaven #falseflag,” the tweet read.
Theorists are already blaming the government for staging the bombing as a “false flag” operation. “False flag” is the term used to refer to an allegedly staged event with which the government will use to rally support for some specific cause. Conspiracy theorists allege that the 9/11 attacks were a false flag operation to gain the public’s support in invading Afghanistan.
Because Jones, who appeared on Piers Morgan after the Sandy Hook shootings to explain why he believes the school massacre was a hoax, made his tweet so early in the investigation of the Boston Marathon bombing, he should lose all credibility.
According to his tweet, Jones had the appropriate evidence to say that the bombing “stinks to high heaven” mere hours after it occurred. It is impossible for him to have known enough about the bombing to make this claim. There is no respectable reason for one to jump to this claim so instinctually, and yet, several blogs and hundreds of comments have already been made in support of this man’s completely unfounded remarks.
There are many ways to interpret evidence; if one examines what is available and decides that some extreme theory is the most reasonable, then so be it. But Jones had no strong evidence to interpret when me made his now-famous tweet. It seems that no victim of a terrorist attack will be safe from the basely irrational theorists on the Internet.
I might have more trust in the corporate media to disseminate factual information if they had shown any watchdog tendencies in any other areas of importance to our lives as citizens of this nation and the world. Pick pretty much any issue at random from torture to war to loss of individuals freedoms and they have failed us miserably.
Pretty hard to get happy about that
Happy that the Daily Trojan Editorial Department thinks it’s valuable to go on conspiracy watch.
“It is impossible for him to have known enough about the bombing to make this claim.”
As if, given more time, he would have had BETTER EVIDENCE? Glad the angle for this is that he doesn’t have enough information, as if had he waited a little longer, his claim would actually make sense. 
“He should lose all credibility.” 
How insightful. Because he clearly had lots of credibility before the incident, right? 
“It seems that no victim of a terrorist attack will be safe from the basely irrational theorists on the Internet.” 
Translation: “There are stupid people on the internet who say ill-informed things about acts of violence.” What a nice observation.
Will,  Has anyone followed up on what happened to Rachel Levy, a USC staff member, who was scheduled to run in the Boston Marathon to raise money for Soldier’s Best Friend.  The USC Chronicle had an article about this in yesterday’s issue.
