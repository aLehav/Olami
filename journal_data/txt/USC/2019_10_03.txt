No. 5 USC men’s water polo is preparing for two critical games this weekend against No. 13 UC Irvine and No. 4 UC Santa Barbara.
While the Trojans’ season thus far has been packed with road tournaments, the team will have home-pool advantage in its Saturday afternoon match against the Anteaters. UCI left last weekend’s SoCal Invitational with a 1-3 record, including a win over Pomona-Pitzer and losses to No. 7 UC Berkeley, UC San Diego and tournament co-host Loyola Marymount. 
The Trojan offense has been formidable so far this season, with their top three scorers — drivers junior Jacob Mercep, senior Marin Dasic and sophomore Hannes Daube — all posting 14 goals or more. However, UCI freshman goalie Harrison Land, who is averaging 10.3 saves per game, will pose a threat to USC’s scoring effort. 
“Against Irvine, we will prepare to our maximum, to know their matchups, to know the goalie, to know their strengths and weaknesses and then we will approach that game … very, very serious,” head coach Marko Pintaric said. “Because following the scores this year, every opponent is dangerous. [With] our team allowing on average 9 goals per game, [and] then if you have a bad shooting day, that’s an indicator that you can lose to anybody.”
The highly anticipated rematch against the Gauchos will take place the following day in Santa Barbara, giving the Trojans a limited turnaround to prepare and reset. 
UCSB’s momentum has slowed recently, with its undefeated win streak halted this past weekend at the SoCal Invitational due to close losses to No. 2 UCLA and No. 3 Pacific. USC’s upset loss to the Gauchos early in the season, which broke a 55-game win streak over UCSB, is still fresh in the players’ minds, but they are confident that a solid and consistent defense will be the key to avenging the loss. 
“Traditionally, we’ve always wanted to establish our teams as defensive [teams], so obviously this season we’re not accomplishing that goal,” Pintaric said. “And the focus will [still be] to figure out how to, as a team, perform as a defensive unit for a longer period of time, for the whole game, not just showing short brilliant, bursts of defense.”
At last week’s SoCal Invite, goalies junior Vaios Vlahotasios and sophomore Nic Porter saw some action with 11 saves and 21 goals allowed and 27 saves and 19 goals allowed, respectively. In the fifth-place match against Cal, the Trojan defense faltered, and even redshirt senior 2-meter Sam Slobodien’s impressive six exclusions drawn could not make up for the staggering 19 exclusions on both sides. 
The entire Trojan defense will be tested Sunday. UCSB junior attacker Cole Brosnan has racked up 38 goals so far this season, and senior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic posted a personal best offensive effort so far this season against Pepperdine with a hat trick and an assist.
Beyond the defensive intricacies, redshirt junior utility Luka Karaman said having the proper confidence going into the weekend will propel the team forward. 
“It’s always easier to play in front of a home crowd,” Karaman said. “But other than that, no, it shouldn’t change [our mentality]. We still have the same mindset going before every game, and that’s [to be] on top.”
The Trojans host UCI at Uytengsu Aquatics Center Saturday at 1 p.m. before heading to Santa Barbara to face the Gauchos at the Campus Pool Sunday at noon.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation Monday that will allow California college athletes to be paid for the use of their name, image and likeness. 
As someone who has been playing “NCAA Basketball 10” for nearly a decade and “NCAA Football 14” for half that — games which garner revenue from their portrayals of college athletes — this news really hit close to home.
California’s Fair Pay to Play Act will go into effect Jan. 1, 2023, providing ample time for other states and the NCAA to respond. Other states may attempt to follow California, the NCAA will continue to attempt to hide behind the rhetoric of amateurism and, once the rhetoric no longer works, the organization will find a way to get its cut of athlete compensation. 
In fact, all three of these actions are already in motion. 
Florida state rep. Kionne McGhee wasted no time filing a similar collegiate athlete compensation bill, and a New York senator proposed a bill that calls for the direct payment of college athletes through their universities. 
The NCAA, like the billion dollar corporation it is, responded exactly as most would expect, calling the payment of college athletes detrimental to amateurism and stating that “We will consider next steps in California while our members move forward with ongoing efforts to make adjustments to NCAA name, image and likeness rules that are both realistic in modern society and tied to higher education.” 
Albeit professional, that statement should strike fear in California colleges and student-athletes across the nation.
For those not versed in reading through media statements, first of all, enjoy that innocence. Secondly, allow me to return to the actual purpose of this column and point out a parallel between the student-athlete compensation situation and music. 
When Tekashi 6ix9ine’s former manager Kifano “Shotti” Jordan was on the stand facing several felony charges with a stack of evidence the size of a Chip Kelly playbook working against him, his response was to shout “We don’t bend, we don’t fold, we don’t break,” while backing the gang that led to his arrest and simultaneously threatening his adversaries.
The only difference between Shotti’s response to his future imprisonment and the NCAA’s response to the Fair Pay to Play Act was their target audience. The NCAA essentially threatened punishment to California colleges and told everyone else that it plans to adapt rather than bend, fold or break. 
But what will adaptation look like for a power-hungry organization whose main resource — its athletes — will soon take a slice of its once-monopolized pie?
The answer is to eat off the plates of the athletes that the organization has made a living off starving. It’s a method already widely practiced in, you guessed it, the music industry. 
When the multi-billion dollar music industry experienced a decline in record sales, labels found a new way to maximize their artists’ profit capability. Rather than taking a percentage strictly from the amount of records an artist sells, labels began to take from artists’ earnings from tour tickets, movie deals and even local pop-up shops.
This type of deal is technically listed as a “multiple rights deal,” but is commonly referred to as a 360 deal since the label takes artist money from literally every sector. 
Being a proud journalism major, I understand the importance of objectivity in media, so I will present both sides of the 360 deal. 
From the artist’s perspective, they are being robbed. Due to their label’s inability to sell records, they have to give up checks from other avenues like movie contracts and tour tickets. From the label’s perspective, they are stealing from the artist. In response to not being able to make as much money as they would like from an artist’s music, they decide to find other ways to take as much money from the artist as they can. 
I’ll admit that wasn’t very objective.
The actual stance of labels is that they are entitled to a percentage of every deal the artist makes because they contribute to the artist’s success by leveraging media networks and exclusive feature and tour placements. 
These were all things that labels provided in the past without taking percentages because record sales were high, but when sales declined, the industry had to adapt.
It’s easy to picture a situation in which the NCAA makes the same argument as the music industry: It is entitled to student-athletes’ endorsement dollars because it provides the stage for performance. 
The Fair Pay to Play Act is a step in the right direction, but by no means is the battle for college athlete compensation over. Much like the music industry did years prior, the NCAA will find a new way to make sure the hard work and talent of players feed those at the top first.

The USC volleyball team has a chance to turn its season around with a pair of matchups against Pac-12 opponents this weekend. 
After a win against Arizona, the Trojans will look to keep their momentum going this weekend against No. 24 Washington State and No. 8 Washington at Galen Center.  
The Huskies enter the matchup with an impressive 10-2 record this season, while the Cougars are 12-2 and will play UCLA before visiting USC. 
Meanwhile, the Trojans have had an up-and-down start to the 2019 season, coming into the weekend at 7-5. 
With each game, the Trojans seem to be improving both offensively and defensively. This weekend will be a big test for them, considering they are unranked in the AVCA coaches poll for the first time since 2017.
The Trojans are still 4-0 at home and will need to keep this win streak alive. Although the rankings are not in USC’s favor, senior libero Jenna Adams views the upcoming games as more of an opportunity than a challenge. 
“The Pac-12 is so competitive, and these are great opportunities to improve our rankings and just continue moving up in the Pac-12,” Adams said. “So I look at these as great opportunities to improve, learn and get better.”
In their last meeting against the Huskies, the Trojans lost 3-1. However, USC still leads the all-time series 41-28. 
Defensively, Adams said that USC has been dedicating a lot of time to scouting its upcoming opponents. This includes watching film, analyzing the various types of plays they run and discussing how to stop these Washington teams. 
As a libero — the defensive specialist of the team — and one of its more polished players, USC will benefit from having Adams back from injury.
USC will rely on AVCA All-Americans senior outside hitter Khalia Lanier and junior outside hitter Brooke Botkin to get the young team back on track.
USC has struggled with offensive rhythm and tempo this season, and it will be critical for the Trojans to improve against Washington State’s strong defense. 
“I think offense is something we work on every single day,” Adams said. “Getting rhythm with the hitters, sometimes it’s a day in, day out [sort of thing]. Some days it’s there, and some days it’s not.”
Playing at Galen Center will provide a big advantage for USC this weekend, and the Trojans will look to feed off the crowd’s energy. 
While it’s been a rocky start to the season, Adams believes the team is trending upward. 
“We’re learning more about our team culture and the team dynamic this year,” she said. “So I think each game we’re improving.” 
There’s no denying this hasn’t been the start that USC expected, but with two underdog wins this weekend, USC can right the ship and return to their usual dominant ways. 
The Trojans will try to do just that starting against Washington at 8 p.m. Friday, before taking on Washington State at noon Sunday.

As a child, Eliot Ohlemeyer was more interested in the background set of a production than those performing before it. 
“Since I was a little child, maybe four or five, I was always fascinated with theater [and] building,” Ohlemeyer said. “I would always have Legos and Lincoln Logs, toy soldiers, and I would just build, build, build. My parents would come in, and I was still building. I’ve always had a fascination with creating structures.” 
Ohlemeyer, now a junior in the BFA Theatre Design program at the School of Dramatic Arts, is designing the set of the upcoming show “Men on Boats” which premieres Oct. 3 in the McClintock Theatre. The play follows the true story of an 1869 expedition to chart the Green and Colorado rivers — the play, however, takes creative liberty with its casting.
“What I like about this story in particular is the journey that these women take,” Ohlemeyer said. “The play is about John Wesley Powell and his expedition down the Colorado. [But] what is unique about this play is that it is an all-female cast, but the cast [is] portraying the men on the boats.”
Along with stage design at SDA, Ohlemeyer is part of the ROTC program at USC. His experience in ROTC has helped him expand his artistic horizons by making videos for the group. It all started when he was called in by the head of Trojan Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Laura Skinner. 
“She called me in, sat me down and said, ‘All right Ohlemeyer … I need a recruitment video,’ and so I was like, ‘Roger, ma’am,’ walked out and I was like, ‘Oh my god, I don’t know how to make a video,’” Ohlemeyer said. “But you know, I’m here at USC, the No. 1 film school is here on campus. I will network and try to find people who can help me.” 
Ohlemeyer knew it was important to produce high quality content and was fortunate enough to use skills acquired through a film management course. These videos helped Ohlemeyer market himself as a video creator for future ROTC films. Ohlemeyer’s work even drew the attention of the Commander of ROTC for the United States Army. 
“He came to USC, saw the product and was like, ‘Hey, do you want to make videos for me?’” Ohlemeyer said. “So that’s what I did this summer.” 
With the same team who helped produce his first video, Ohlemeyer spent five weeks at Fort Knox working on another recruitment campaign. 
“It was such a great experience,” Ohlemeyer said. “If given the chance, I would totally want to do something like this again.” 
As a student in the ROTC program, Ohlemeyer is committed to following his passion for the arts while simultaneously fulfilling his moral duty to his country. He hopes that by staying in Los Angeles for his service, he can be a role model for other service members that they too can follow artistic passions even within the army. 
But what ultimately drives Ohlemeyer to pursue his art is his passion for telling unique stories that have not yet been told. 
“There is a concept called ‘the Other,’ and it’s basically like a society term. It’s people or a thing that can be anything different from you or your experience per se, and it’s about highlighting the ‘other,’ telling its story,” Ohlemeyer said. “It’s about highlighting the differences or telling that story, so it can potentially make a change or make you think differently on a subject or an idea that may be relevant today or could be something that happened in the past.”
This is why he plans to continue developing his artistic passions even while serving his country.
“Part of the commitment with ROTC is that I have an eight-year mandatory service,” Ohlemeyer said. “I’m leaning toward going to the reserves — that way I can still drill with my unit here in Los Angeles while growing not only as an artist but also growing my career on the side.” 
The work Ohlemeyer has done has helped him realize his love of producing and the satisfaction of completing a job. Ohlemeyer created a production company with fellow Trojans Jon Joei, a sophomore majoring in cinematic arts,  film and television production, and Brian Femminella, a sophomore majoring in intelligence and cyber operations and political science. Once he graduates, Ohlemeyer wants to work to ensure that veterans also have the opportunity to pursue film and art. 
“I know that there are a lot of veterans who are fascinated [by] or work in the entertainment industry,” Ohlemeyer said. “Later down the line, I want to start a veteran, solely veteran production company per se, that is helping out people who just got out of service or are in service and that still have a fascination with telling stories.”

Lostboycrow is on the road again — this time, with a new haircut, new sound and a new album in hand.
I chatted with the Oregon-born singer about his newest musical project “Santa Fe” ahead of his tour stop in Los Angeles alongside my favorite band flor. 
LBC’s music is evolving and ever-changing, and though I was hooked on some of his first tracks like “Powers” and “Talk Back to Me” back in 2016, his newest tracks evoke a newfound sense of maturity and vulnerability.
Take the vocally-driven title track for example, where LBC asks himself, “Who am I?” and reassures himself that “you could be strong.”
When you listen to the project, be sure to use earphones — “Santa Fe” is one of those albums you have to listen to from start to finish. With the “Passing Through” interlude between the title track and “Suburban Girl,” you can literally feel the music “passing through” your brain. It’s trippy and I love it.
“This new album was me really trying to be intentional with the sound and figuring out my sound,” he tells me ahead of the tour. 


Talk to me about this new album, “Santa Fe.”
We went to Santa Fe, a small group of us, and tried to really limit ourselves as far as the instruments we were using and the people that we brought in. We tried to actually just hone in on the sound of me. And a lot of that came from me starting the songs on the acoustic guitar. When the music is starting and ending with me [as] opposed to somebody else, then I think it is going to be a little bit truer to who I am as a songwriter. 
I would definitely say “Santa Fe” is the first, big monumental step [into] “my sound.”
Definitely. And how does that feel to even be able to say that as an artist?
It feels really good. That’s oversimplified, but I’m proud of all the music I’ve released. A lot of it has provided me with cool opportunities, and it has become a catalyst for what I do now. And I know it means a lot to other people too. But to actually have, where I’m at creatively, with what everyone else gets to hear for me, to have that line align closer and closer is always the goal. 
In any industry, you make art, and then you might be sitting on it for a while because it’s just not the right time to release it or whatever the reason may be, and so I think part of what I’ve tried to do now is just bridge that gap between what I’m creating, where I’m at now and what people actually get to hear.
How would you describe your general sound like when somebody goes on Spotify and goes to your profile?
That’s such a tough question. It’s a very, very valid question. I ask that question to other people all the time. But I think when you’re the artist being asked, it’s very hard to answer without sounding really pretentious. 
The older catalog was kind of blending genres between electronic and R&B. Those are two genres I feel comfortable describing the older stuff like. And then the newer album “Santa Fe” and the stuff I’m working on now, that’s all very guitar-driven. It still has elements of the other genres, I would just say it’s a lot more guitar-driven, vocal-centered dance music.
That’s probably how I would have described it, too. I love this album, and “Violet Sky” is definitely one of my favorites. I like how you made a reference to an older song, “Devil In the Backseat.”
I always kind of like tying things together like that because I think each album can be a chapter of the sound and the time of the artist’s life. I think it’s cool, even with different sounds to still lyrically bridge the gap sometimes and leave that trail for everybody who’s going along to the whole journey or for people to maybe go back and discover.
We’re getting a different sound but also a new look! Was that also on purpose or on a whim?
It was somewhat on a whim. I didn’t really think of it as “new era, I’m going to cut my hair.” But I think it was just time. Maybe subconsciously, it had to do with me beginning a new chapter. I just felt like I needed a weight lifted off of my shoulders, literally and figuratively. [It was] kind of time for a change. I think the hair is a very tangible change that you can make when you’re transitioning chapters in your life. I ended up cutting it quite a bit shorter last fall and gradually shorter and shorter. It’s kind of addicting too. After the first time I got it cut, it just felt like me or at least where I’m at right now.
So your L.A. stop with flor is coming soon. Obviously, you’re friends with flor. What’s that like touring with them?
It’s kind of surreal sometimes because it really is like a dream come true. I remember Kyle [one of flor’s members] and I, in high school, just being in our upstairs rooms just jamming out, trying to write songs. Like, “Wouldn’t it be great if we could do this together on a larger scale?” Then flash forward, he joined flor and I’m Lostboycrow, and we’re both kind of parallel on our journey. 
It was really special the first time that those journeys collided. We were able to do a short tour together, and now it just feels like that was just a taste of what it could have been. Now, it feels right. It’s hard to wrap my head around it because it seems like such a long time coming because we’re all so close. It’s pretty surreal to actually think that we are going on like a full U.S. tour together, but I couldn’t be happier about it. I think the fans have seen us over the years interact and how supportive we are of each other.
If someone logs on to your Spotify to listen to your music for the first time, what should they listen to?
I would want them to listen to “Waste of Time – Live at Lucy’s Meat Market.” That’s like a live version of the song and how we actually play it at a show. 
That’s your track with Bea Miller, right?
Yeah! It was really cool. I really value her as a human. As an artist, she’s really badass. She just knows what she wants and isn’t afraid to go for it. I knew I wanted another voice on “Waste Of Time.” She was already somebody that I really respected, and she’s easy to work with, so it’s really cool to have her on that.
Lastly, why should people stan you?
I’m so curious about what other people said! Well, because I stan them. I hope that someone would be a bit of themselves in their journey — in my journey — as I’m very transparent with the journey of who I am as a person and becoming Lostboycrow in my music. I would hope that somebody can see their own journey within my music and be inspired by that and feel that they stan themselves.

Imagine this: a college campus where sexual health is normalized, where campus organizations and leadership hand out condoms like candy, where students speak on these historically taboo subjects, where students feel emotionally, mentally and physically secure. A sexual health utopia, if you will, where students don’t need to pay an absurd amount of money to see if they have contracted a sexually transmitted infection.   
USC ostensibly projects that it is on the right track. Just this September, USG introduced an initiative through a USC Student Health program for free HIV testing in an effort to destigmatize sexual health and normalize STI testing on campus. While these efforts are admirable and a step in the right direction, they fall short of true destigmatization. 
The USG initiative reflects yet another ploy that, despite its sincere efforts and potential impact, stands as merely a promotion for the progressive standard USC strives to portray. In order for USC to complement its endorsement of a safe sex environment, USC Student Health should additionally fund and implement more comprehensive, free-of-cost STI-testing programs. 
On a campus where students rely on the Engemann Student Health Center for medical treatment, it seems like common sense that STI testing be readily available there. In fact, it is. But the advertised free annual STI screening only applies to students who have the student health insurance plan. 
While Engemann still conducts STI screenings for students with private health insurance plans, these students are expected to cover the costs of the tests themselves. Certain health insurance companies, such as TRICARE Prime, require that clients solely use their primary care provider to book appointments in order to be reimbursed. This becomes problematic when the primary provider practices out of state, leaving some students under private health insurance companies with limited options when it comes to finding extensive and affordable STI screenings.
Ultimately, however, this conflict should not waive the University’s responsibility to provide access to comprehensive screening programs. Although there are several off-campus locations that offer free comprehensive STI testing, including the LGBT Center in Hollywood, transportation is still an impeding factor. 
By relying on another Los Angeles clinic to carry out this responsibility, USC contradicts itself as a campus that preaches safe sexual health practices while ignoring the risks that still accompany them. Not to mention, these clinics, along with free HIV testing, act as scapegoats in this “dollhouse” of a campus that externally prioritizes sexual well-being but does not internally commit to a solution. On the outside, these resources do present as inclusive to all students regardless of sexuality. But upon second glance, stigmatization still exists, and it won’t go away any time soon unless USC approaches this issue from a different angle. 
If USC really wants to destigmatize sexual health and reflect both inclusivity and advancement, it should look to a different model. Take the University of New Mexico, for example. As part of its STI Testing Tuesdays initiative, UNM offers free testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia twice a month on select Tuesdays along with free HIV testing twice a month on select Thursdays.  
This model not only covers more STI tests but transforms STI testing into a publicized campus-wide event that promotes these screenings and fosters sexual health. By offering easily accessible monthly events, UNM acknowledges the risks that naturally accompany any sexual contact and takes responsibility for its students. USC could learn a thing or two from this approach. 
USC should abandon its efforts to pose as progressive with non-comprehensive STI screening programs and commitment to only half of the responsibility for students’ sexual well-being. If the University truly prioritizes sexual health on campus, a sexual health paradise may not be so far-fetched after all.

I was recently informed by some Daily Trojan reporters that the bust of Rufus von KleinSmid was found vandalized hours before the inauguration of President Carol Folt. As a 2018 USG senator, I issued a petition to encourage USC to formally disavow von KleinSmid’s racist and eugenicist legacy and change the name of the building. With the help of my team, I also introduced and successfully passed a resolution to encourage USC’s administration to adopt a new name. 
For this reason, I wanted to directly address those who committed this act of vandalism and those who might commit further acts: There is no need to take this type of action. Regardless of whether or not USC decides to make this change, the most important battle was won the day our student body chose to embrace its power to make change. By believing you have the power to forge a better future for USC, you have already embodied von KleinSmid’s greatest fear: that people of color can challenge power and reclaim their own destiny. 
First, I understand why you may have decided to take this action. You might be a person of color like me, and you might have witnessed generations suffer as supposedly “democratic” institutions fail to take the concerns of your people seriously. You may have learned the history of people of color through an elective class, where you discovered how colonizers conquered their land and reduced their lives to a degrading servitude. Their cultures and languages were replaced and erased, leading colonized peoples to develop an inferiority complex around their own culture while fetishizing the status symbols of their conquerors. 
You may have even come to a terrifying realization that people of color are actively participating in the education and society created by these same men and that, by merely existing within this system, they are being trained to think and behave in the ways these white supremacists desired. This realization may lead some people of color to nihilism and hopeless rage as they realize their minds have been molded by an oppressive system and their fate is seemingly forever shackled to a submission to white supremacy. This idea may cause people of color or those sympathetic to their condition to adopt a more absolutist mindset — one in which all actions that attack a racist system are appropriate. Including vandalizing the statue of an avowed racist like von KleinSmid.
There’s no need to vandalize VKC. No matter what USC decides to do, we are victorious. 
I’d like to note here that I say this with a keen awareness of the track record of USC’s administration and that I continue to be highly skeptical it will ever take the opportunity to right this wrong and change the name. 
During the campaign to pass that resolution, my own life was threatened. I had to reflect on whether this cause was really worth it. In the end, I decided that it was, even if it cost me my life. Not because I wanted to change the name of a building but because I felt a responsibility to show that no system of power can conquer the human spirit; that people of color have the power to throw off the yoke of white supremacy’s control over our lives and replace it with the absolute supremacy of our own human will. 
So don’t busy yourself vandalizing VKC. To truly defeat racists like von KleinSmid, recognize that you are not destined to live a cursed fate, that you have the power to reclaim your own destiny, that you have the power to change the world.

Both USC golf teams were in action this past weekend, as the No. 4 women’s team headed east to the aptly named Golf, Ill. to defend their title at the Windy City Collegiate Invitational, and the No. 11 men’s team traveled up north to Witch Hollow, Ore. for the Nike Golf Collegiate.
The women’s team posted another solid showing but came up just short of repeating as winners of the Windy City Collegiate Classic. The Trojans finished second in the tournament, an improvement from their fifth place performance in the season-opening ANNIKA invitational two weeks ago.
The Trojans carded 36 holes at the Glen View Golf Club on the first day, shooting 286 and 262 to place one spot back of South Carolina.
Tuesday’s round served as the deciding factor in determining who would take the top spot on the podium. Junior Jennifer Chang finished off the round with key birdies on the final par 4s, finishing with a 3-under 69. Senior Allisen Corpuz recovered from early bogeys with an eagle on hole eight and posted two birdies on the back nine to finish with a 2-under 70.
Despite taking the lead briefly before the final nine holes, the Trojans couldn’t edge out the Gamecocks, who finished with a three shot lead with a 14-under 850. Chang and Corpuz led the team individually as both finished third overall at 6-under 210. 
The tournament marked a career-best performance for Corpuz, who shot under par for 54 holes and led the field in birdies. She credited her success to the additional coaching on her short game in the week leading up to the event.
“[Head coach Justin Silverstein] mentioned something about my putting stroke on Thursday at practice, and it gave me something to focus on while I was putting this week,” Corpuz said. “I just felt a lot better over my putts.”
The women’s team’s effort was spearheaded by an impressive showing from Chang, who may have played in her last tournament as a Trojan. Chang is expected to advance in the second stage of the LPGA Qualifying Tournament, which determines if amateur competitors are ready to attain professional status on the LPGA tour.
Though Chang has not yet made an official decision, Silverstein said the coaching staff is “mentally preparing that she’s going to be gone,” adding that he has “at least five players, possibly six, [that are] eager to fill those shoes.”
Meanwhile, the men’s team ran into some difficulties in its second tournament of the season. The Trojans finished in 11th place despite solid showings from junior Issei Tanabe and sophomore Charlie Reiter. It was a step back from their fifth place finish at the season-opening Maui Jim Invitational.
Reiter said the tournament was tough for USC but still maintained optimistic for his team.  
“It’s just the second tournament of the year,” Reiter said. “So we’re getting ourselves situated for the upcoming year, and we’re going to progress.”
Freshman Yuxin Lin was a notable omission from the men’s lineup. He was unable to make the tournament after winning the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship in Shanghai, China, just a day prior to the Nike Golf Collegiate’s opening round. 
“Him winning that tournament is amazing,” Reiter said. “He’s going to be a great contributor for this year, and we’re excited that he’s here.”
Tanabe has been one of the team’s most consistent players this season, posting a score of 68 four times in his six rounds. Tanabe finished the tournament strong, climbing up 19 spots to tie for 36th on the final individual leaderboard with a 2-over 215. 
Reiter was in the top 10 early on in the tournament but eventually slipped to 19th place in the final round, posting a 3-over 74 on day three.
The women’s team will tee off next Oct. 11 in Stanford, Calif., for the Stanford Intercollegiate. The men’s team will be back in action Oct. 14 in Simi Valley, Calif., for the Bill Cullum Invitational.

With the MLB postseason beginning Tuesday, the Trojans have exactly zero former players taking the field on baseball’s biggest stage. 
However, that doesn’t mean that USC has no alumni who could make a potential Fall Classic run. It’s only fitting that former Trojan Aaron Boone is leading the charge for the New York Yankees as they look to add to an MLB-high 27 World Series championships, 25 years after he played for the program with double the College World Series titles of any other school in the nation.
Boone, now in his second season as the Yankees’ manager, played third base at USC from 1992-1994. He is the younger brother of Bret Boone, a retired 14-year major leaguer and three-time All-Star who also played for the Trojans. 
Though Aaron claims to have been a Trojan fan before his brother started college in 1988, he admitted that continuing the family tradition made his time at USC all the more special. 
“I had become a huge ‘SC [football fan] when I was in middle school,” the La Mesa, Calif. native said. “And then my brother happened to go to ‘SC, so it just got me more entrenched with the school and with the program. And then all throughout high school, I always wanted to go to ‘SC. So when that became a reality, it was pretty cool.”
Boone made the most of the opportunity to play collegiate baseball at USC. In his three years as a Trojan, Boone hit .302 with an .821 OPS to earn a third round selection by the Cincinnati Reds in the 1994 MLB Draft. 
Though Aaron and Bret just missed out on donning the Cardinal and Gold together, they finally had a chance to take the field as teammates with the Cincinnati Reds in 1998. On the last day of the season, the Boones made up half of the first starting infield in baseball history comprising two sets of brothers. 
“It was a great way to get my feet under me at the big-league level,” Aaron said of playing third base in the latter half of his rookie season while Bret played across the infield at second. “To have [my] brother over there, it was really cool.”
The Boone lineage in Cincinnati didn’t stop when Bret was traded to the Atlanta Braves in the winter after the 1998 season. Aaron only had to wait two years for his father Bob to take over as the Reds’ manager. 
The two had shared a clubhouse before. When Aaron was a toddler, Bob was a catcher for the Philadelphia Phillies. The future Yankees manager routinely hung out in the Veterans Stadium clubhouse with his father and his teammates — including Steve Carlton, Mike Schmidt and Pete Rose — who often got a kick out of Aaron’s impersonations of various Phillies. 
“One of the things I’m so grateful [for] with my dad is he always took us with him,” Boone said. “We were always at the park with him, so we got to know and be around so many great guys, got to do so many great things at the ballpark as kids growing up that  allowed us to fall in love with the game.”
But now, with father and son on the same team, the circumstances were different. Most people would find Boone’s situation peculiar and, at times, slightly uncomfortable, but that’s not how it played out. 
“He didn’t really treat me any different, wasn’t harder on me, wasn’t easier on me,” Boone said of his father. “I was an established player at that point, and he treated me with a lot of respect like I was one of his established players. And then away from the field, to have my mom and dad around was cool … I never felt weirdness from my teammates … I never wanted them to feel like they had to hold their tongue around me or anything like that, and I don’t think that was the case.”
The father-son duo in Cincinnati was short-lived. After two-and-a-half subpar seasons, the elder Boone was fired midway through the 2003 season. Just three days later, Aaron was traded to the Yankees. 
Boone spent half a season with New York. He hit six home runs, drove in 31 runs and posted a modest .254/.302/.418 line through 54 regular season games there. 
But this is the season you think of when you think of Aaron Boone. Not because of those numbers, not even because of his stellar first half with the Reds that landed him a spot on the National League All-Star team. 
It’s the year when Boone became an October legend.
The Yankees were facing their archrival Red Sox in Game 7 of the 2003 ALCS. Boone was at the plate against Boston’s Tim Wakefield in the bottom of the 11th. He was in the midst of a forgettable postseason, going 5-for-31 with nine strikeouts and 1 RBI to that point. 
With one swing, none of that mattered. Boone clobbered a first pitch knuckleball into the left field seats at Yankee Stadium, sending New York to the World Series.
It’s one of the most famous moments in baseball history, and it came out of nowhere — a surprising feat considering Boone’s lack of postseason experience (in the majors, at least).
In the last two years of Boone’s college career, USC reached the NCAA Regional Finals, where a win would have put them in the College World Series. The Trojans lost to Texas in 1993 and LSU in 1994, and Boone twice fell a game shy of Omaha. 
Still, his experience in those games would prove crucial. Though the stakes might have been a little higher, Game 7 of the ALCS wasn’t Boone’s first time playing for a ticket to the final destination. 
“Everything you experience in the course of your life prepares you and hopefully plays a role in your career,” Boone said. “Playing in huge regional settings at LSU and Texas with everything on the line — I think those are where you gain experience. I certainly think it helped me moving forward in my career.”
Perhaps Boone’s most remarkable feat came when he was a Houston Astro in 2009. That March, he received open heart surgery to replace an aortic valve. Boone had known of his heart condition since he was at USC, but the effects had recently accelerated. 
Six months after writing goodbye letters to his family in case he didn’t survive the procedure, Boone became the first Major Leaguer in history to play after undergoing open heart surgery. 
“To be able to get back to where I got to play in the big leagues again in the month of September — I remember my first game back, how nervous I was just being out in the field again,” Boone said. “But it was really rewarding to get to play with my teammates again for that month of September.”
2009 was Boone’s last season as a player. On Feb. 23, 2010, the 12-year veteran hung up his spikes, headed for ESPN’s Baseball Tonight and shuffled between the studio and the broadcast booth until 2017. 
Now, Boone finds himself back where he’s spent a good chunk of his life: in the dugout. From playing third base at USC to taking over as the manager of baseball’s most famous franchise, it’s clear that Boone can’t seem to keep out of the spotlight. 
“I guess it just kind of happened to work out that way,” Boone said, laughing. “I’ve loved, obviously, my ties to USC. I think people that know me know how much it means to me and how much the University means to me … I feel so proud and honored to get to come to work every day for the Pinstripes. I feel blessed [for] the opportunities that I’ve had in my lifetime in being able to chase my dreams.”
Through all of his career’s twists and turns, Boone hasn’t forgotten the campus that kickstarted it all. 
“It’s such a majestic place,” Boone said of USC. “I think they do a great job of preparing people for careers and for life after college, so to speak. Not just me and baseball — I think it’s just something that the University has always done well, and it’s a great place to have gone to school.” 
Boone has made a name for himself as a manager for his willingness to get in an umpire’s face when he disagrees with a call. His most famous rant, during which he screamed at a home plate umpire, “My guys are fucking savages in that box,” has become a rallying cry for the 2019 Bronx Bombers. Boone, who was ejected from his MLB debut as a player, described himself as “pretty laid back” before conceding that “I had my moments.”
Though he denied that college Boone was also a “savage,” it wouldn’t be an unfair word to describe his baseball career. Boone has already etched his name into the history books, and a 28th World Series ring for the Yankees would further cement his legacy as one of baseball’s greats. 
If there’s anyone in the game who’s up to the task, it’s Aaron Boone — the man who has seen and done it all.

As women’s soccer continues to gain traction in the United States, expansion of the National Women’s Soccer League appears inevitable. Within the last six years, the NWSL has welcomed three new teams — the Houston Dash in 2014, Orlando Pride in 2016 and Utah Royals FC in 2018 — affiliated with their city’s respective MLS team. It’s time for Los Angeles to finally have an NWSL team of its own.
Ever since the ownership group of the Los Angeles Football Club was announced, there have been whispers about expanding to the NWSL. Especially with the inclusion of ex-USWNT star Mia Hamm in the star-studded ownership team, many expected the discussion of investing in a women’s team to arise early. 
While some criticized Hamm for investing in a men’s team before a women’s team, her leadership and passion for the women’s game will position her at the forefront of such a decision. 
Hamm is the only woman on the ownership team and understands both the experiences female athletes face and the necessity for women’s soccer to grow. If LAFC pursues this opportunity, I’m confident that she will lead the charge in creating a world-class environment for women’s soccer.
Just as LAFC received early support before the team was even formed, many soccer fans have shown their enthusiasm about bringing the NWSL to L.A. NWSL’s social media accounts are constantly bombarded with questions and petitions for LAFC to invest in a women’s team. 
Excitement about bringing the NWSL to L.A. has spread to Banc of California Stadium. At the last few LAFC home games, LAFC’s loyal supporter union, the 3252, flew banners and flags with the NWSL logo saying “Bring NWSL to LA.”
LAFC’s success has garnered the brand much excitement in a short amount of time. In just two years, the club has already become a heavy favorite to win the MLS cup. Given LAFC’s early success, it’s not unreasonable to imagine the same results for a new NWSL team in LA.
The other most populous cities in the United States — New York, Houston and Chicago — all have NWSL teams. Given such widespread representation, it is baffling that Los Angeles is still without a team in the league. By not investing in an L.A. team, the NWSL is missing out on a large market.
Southern California is a soccer hotbed. Los Angeles has two MLS teams because the soccer market in L.A. has the capacity to provide both with many fans. The area’s role in women’s soccer specifically is also evident. Southern California has produced many talented female soccer players who went on to play for different national and professional teams. Two stars from the USWNT’s World Cup-winning roster this summer, Alex Morgan and Christen Press, hailed from SoCal. Many players have also benefited from the dominant youth clubs and successful college programs right here at USC and across town at UCLA. 
Bringing the NWSL to L.A. would give women’s soccer the representation it deserves in an area that needs it. Seeing strong, athletic women pursue their passions despite countless obstacles empowers everyone, from young girls who just picked up their first sport to high school and college players who are discouraged by the inequality they’ve seen in women’s sports.
So many groups of people are impacted by or connected to this sport in some way or simply drawn in by the confidence and resilience of the athletes. Bringing women’s soccer to L.A. will challenge our community to break gender stereotypes and uplift women everywhere.
There is no NWSL team in Los Angeles just yet, but that does not mean we should just sit, tweet “#BringNWSLtoLA” and wait. Follow the league, watch the games and help women’s soccer grow.

USC alumna Jennifer Zhang always had an interest in watches, but when she started tinkering with them a few years ago, she couldn’t figure out how to put one together. Even after scouring the internet for resources and instructions, she found few sites that could help.
“It took me about five months to assemble my first watch just because there was so much research to do,” Zhang said. “There’s not a lot of information on the internet on how to do it, and all the parts and tools came from over a dozen different suppliers from all over the world — shipping took forever.”
However, Zhang, who graduated from the Marshall School of Business in May 2019, said that actually constructing the watch was a relatively simple task. Had she been supplied a kit with the tools, parts and instructions she needed, she would have finished her first watch in only a few hours, she estimates.
No such kit existed — yet. 
About a year ago, Zhang decided to create Rotate, a startup that sells watchmaking kits. Before graduating in Spring 2019, Zhang took a business entrepreneurship class in Marshall, where she met her future business partners and founded the company. 
Those teammates were William Ma, then a senior majoring in architecture, and another classmate.
The specialized training of each member of the Rotate team worked to the advantage of the company. Ma said that his architecture schooling allowed him to better understand the moving parts of a watch, and his studies informed his watch design process.
While learning to build watches, Ma said he combined his knowledge of design with expertise in digital design platforms that he had used in architecture classes. He also talked to watchmakers to learn about the specialty parts of a mechanical watch.
After the team had learned the underlying mechanics of watchmaking, the project took off.
“We took a lot of photos, put together the manual [for the kits]  place then,” Zhang said. “We made our social media a few months later, started collecting lists of people who would be interested [in] building a website and everything.”
Zhang hopes to raise $20,000 through Kickstarter to make Rotate’s first line of kits, pay for marketing and help the company start selling at shops, markets and trade shows. 
Rotate purchases parts and tools for its kits from about a dozen suppliers around the  globe, and some items are custom made for the company.
“We chose the different suppliers based off of their quality, how relevant they were, whether they’re compatible and just put together what we felt like were the best combination of parts for these watches,” Zhang said.
Zhang explained that Rotate’s kits include all the equipment necessary for making a watch along with an instruction manual that guides the customer through the process. The intended market for the watch kits includes anyone with an interest in watches or building things in general, Zhang said. 
With Rotate, Zhang is taking a leap of faith — she said she quit her full-time job working in sales for a commercial real estate platform to focus on the startup’s launch.
Ma said that as Rotate prepares for launch, its main goal is to find a pool of potential customers. The company is currently trying to reach more people through in-person interactions and cold calls to tell people about the product.
“What we’re looking for is an audience that is engaged and passionate about our product, and we also want to find a new audience — people who are on the fence, who have never heard of this hobby and want to try it,” Ma said. “That’s kind of the vision of what we want to do: push the boundaries of what we normally think is fun and what we normally want to do.”
Zhang said that in the coming years, she hopes to expand Rotate’s reach to commercial platforms and big-box department stores.
“I would just love to grow it as far as I can,” Zhang said. “So like a general timeline would be the Kickstarter ends, we fulfill all the reward tiers, we have the proof of concept we need to get into trade shows, gift shows, shops, [then we start] pitching to bigger companies like Best Buy, Walmart and just growing as far as we can from there.”
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the class in which Zhang met her Rotate teammates was Strategic Management, a business administration course. It was a business entrepreneurship class.

The School of Cinematic Arts will decide if its John Wayne exhibition will be removed by the end of this semester, an SCA official announced at a Wednesday discussion hosted by the school’s Council for Diversity & Inclusion. 
Nearly 50 students attended the discussion prompted by a protest from two SCA students who held a banner in front of the Cinema Complex, calling for the removal of the exhibit, which they said supports Wayne’s legacy of endorsing white supremacy and the removal of indigenous people.  
SCA Interim Assistant Dean of Diversity and Inclusion Evan Hughes began the event by explaining the Council’s efforts to approach the controversy surrounding the exhibit, which features movie posters and memorabilia honoring the alumnus and football player’s film career. He also said that the conversation would provide recommendations to SCA administration for future action related to the exhibit. 
“This has been an issue that the [Council] has debated over a long period of time,” Hughes said. “At the end of last semester, we were trying to figure out different options for paths to move forward with this particular exhibit because not even students, but faculty that have walked by the exhibit said that we don’t think this accurately represents film history as it should probably should be represented.” 
Some students opposed the exhibit’s possible removal, stating the actor contributed to the Western genre in film. They said removing his legacy would erase an aspect of filmmaking history that many students strongly connect with. During the discussion, students were allowed to remain anonymous to create a safe space for conversation.
“Wayne made terrible and condemnable comments … but [that] is not what he is known for,” one student said. “I think there are many positive elements of John Wayne and looking at a figure historically, you have to look at the negative sides and point them out, and I think we should definitely do that, but I also think that he is a net positive figure.”
The initial proposal from SCA included adding a plaque to the exhibit critiquing Wayne’s anti-indigenous and racist work and beliefs. While many students supported this proposal, others argued that the only solution would be removing Wayne completely from SCA. 
Recent controversy surrounding Wayne arose after a 1971 interview with Playboy, in which the actor expressed support for white supremacy and the removal of indigenous people, resurfaced. Reanna Cruz, a junior majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, said the exhibit promotes racist attitudes and ideas.
“Since the reemergence of this particular quotes in [the Playboy interview] I have felt viscerally uncomfortable because of the promotion and glorification of a noted white supremacist [and] racist,” Cruz said.  “Having his items up is a stance against people like myself. And it honors and therefore by extension … is complicit in the promotion of white supremacy.”
Most students who spoke at the event agreed that SCA should remove the exhibit, and many suggested that the school implement a rotating exhibit highlighting filmmakers of color, who are often ignored. 
Throughout the conversation, some students discussed the lack of diversity in film and said SCA contributes to this by spotlighting white, male Hollywood stars in its curriculum and exhibits. 
Eric Plant, one of the leading protesters of the exhibit who created the banner, was almost unable to enter the event because they are not a current SCA student. Plant, a junior majoring in fine arts, said the exhibit makes students feel unsafe.
“It raises an important question that’s discussion,” Plant said. “Does the institution care about the students that exists? Or does it serve money?”
The exhibit on the second floor of SCA was installed in 2012 thanks to a donation. Hughes suggested that if the exhibit is removed, the contract with the donor would have to be discussed. At the end of the discussion, Cruz said the only solution that she and other protesters will accept is the complete removal of the exhibit but were happy that the discussion provided a range of perspectives they hope SCA will consider. 
“I think that the conversation that is happening is a really good one,” Cruz said. “It shows the administration that we are not alone.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law Wednesday that would allow victims of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall to revive sexual assault cases time-barred by the state’s statute of limitations. 
The new law allows cases regarding assaults between 1988 and 2017 seeking more than $250,000 in damages are eligible to be revisited.  Tyndall, who was charged with 29 felony counts in June, is currently being sued by more than 800 individuals in state and federal courts. The former USC doctor’s bail is set at $1.6 million, and he faces up to 53 years in state prison. 
Assembly Judiciary Committee Chair Mark Stone presented a policy analysis April 9 for the bill that argued USC thought the bill could “disrupt the pending $215 million federal class-action settlement for all former patients of Tyndall.” USC also hired a lobbying firm to oppose Assembly Bill 1510.
“While the bill does not name USC or Dr. Tyndall, the bill clearly seeks to allow the USC victims, in particular, to revive claims barred by the statute of limitations in effect,” Stone wrote. “Sponsored by the Consumer Attorneys of California, the bill has the support of several consumer, civil rights and women’s groups.”
USC filed a settlement in February, which would provide tiered compensation for any individuals who were patients of Tyndall. 
Stone said the bill can bring claims that have been voided due to the current statute of limitations, including allegations against Tyndall. 
“As amended, this legislation protects the federal class action settlement for the former patients who prefer the privacy and certainty of that option, while allowing other former patients to litigate their claims publicly if they choose to do so,” USC wrote in a statement. “Providing fair, respectful relief to former patients, while making lasting, impactful changes that safeguard students, strengthen our University, and rebuild trust with our community, remain USC’s top priorities.”
John Manly, an attorney representing over 30 several victims, said Newsom’s decision to approve the legislation represents a step forward for victims.
“What USC also did in 2017 is enter into a deal to pay Dr. Tyndall $200,000, which, by the way, is way more than any of the victims will get in the class action to secretly leave campus, knowing that he had sexually assaulted hundreds of women,” Manly said. “And  what the legislature did is say ‘You’re not getting away with this.’”
The law will now open up the statute of limitations for these assaults for one year, allowing more than 800 plaintiffs to file suit against Tyndall and the University.
“The legislature heard from many, many, many survivors,” Manly said. “The administration has not treated these women like family. They treat them like adversaries or enemies. USC did this to itself, by the way they treated these women.”
Gloria Allred, a prominent women’s rights attorney representing over 60 victims in the case, said she is pleased that all victims will be able to seek damages, regardless of when they were abused.
“We represent victims who saw Dr. Tyndall as early as 1991 and many others who will now be able to seek a fair and just recovery and not face dismissal of their claim simply because of statute of limitations defense,” Allred wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “Our clients are grateful to the California legislators who voted for passage of this important bill and to Governor Newsom who signed the bill today and that it be effective immediately as an emergency measure.”
In March, USC wrote that the legislation was “unnecessary” and “harmful” to plaintiffs. However, the University released a statement Wednesday claiming that new amendments made to the legislation will help protect plaintiffs. 
“[It would be] in part by encouraging members of the class to opt out of the settlement in order to bring or join a separate civil action,” Stone wrote.

Excited students, faculty, staff and guests filled the Iovine and Young Hall courtyard for the grand opening celebration of the school’s new facilities Wednesday. The new building, which officially opened its doors at the start of the fall semester, includes a collaborative makerspace, a podcast studio and an Alumni Lab that the school’s graduates can use for startups and projects.  
IYA Dean Erica Muhl opened the ceremony by thanking the many teams that worked to make the building and Academy a reality. She thanked Iovine and Young for their generous donations to the University and their ideas for the school. 
“The two of you gave us the inspiration that has provided us the greater fuel for everything we do,” Muhl said. “We also want to thank you, of course, for the generous gift of resources that make all of this possible.” 
The Iovine and Young Academy, USC’s newest school, aims to create a collaborative environment in the areas of arts, technology and business. The Academy was founded in 2013 by Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young, more widely known as Dr. Dre.
When the school was first established, all classes took place in “the Garage,” a collaborative work space formerly located on the fourth floor of Steven and Kathryn Sample Hall. The new hall comprises three floors of workspaces, undergraduate and graduate classrooms, conference rooms and a furnished balcony.
During the dedication and ribbon-cutting ceremony, President Carol Folt discussed the importance of IYA and said the program represents an innovative step forward in higher education. She welcomed the creativity the school fosters and praised the Academy’s ability to allow students to think freely.
“We’re at our best when we actually allow people’s imagination to flourish and do what we can to really help people take that innate creativity and talent and put it to use to do solutions that are innovative, sustainable,” Folt said. “In my time here, I know that all of those qualities are what drive our students, our deans and our faculty.”
Xavier Hernandez, an IYA graduate student studying integrated design, business and technology, was excited to see one of his heroes, Dr. Dre. 
“It was amazing to see them speak, amazing to [see] their ideas come to fruition with the help of my professors, my administrators, the dean, all the staff [and] all of these amazing minds coming together,” Hernandez said.
After members of The Spirit of Troy closed out the ceremony, Sydney Loew, a sophomore in the Academy, provided tours to visitors. 
“Today’s event was jaw-dropping,” Loew said. “I was so amazed to see the founders sitting there. They are just such a huge inspiration to all the students, so seeing them in person was just mind-blowing … I just really feel all the possibilities are endless. I’m so happy that all of us have this place to explore our passions or just brand new things as a whole.”
Luke Pottenger, a senior in the Academy, was inspired to see the support from the USC community. He said he hopes the new facilities increase collaboration across schools.
“It was really momentous at the end of my time at USC,” Pottenger said. “I hope to see more convergence of passion and disciplines. I’m starting to see that USC has that a lot throughout the campus.”
Iovine said the next step for the duo is to look into establishing a high school, giving younger students the opportunity to cultivate their creativity and ideas.
“We’re not educators, we’re cheerleaders,” Iovine said. “If we can catch these kids earlier, that’s even better.”
