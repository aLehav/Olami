On the first day of the fall semester, among the usual notes welcoming students back to campus and reminding them of advisement deadlines, one email landed in students’ inboxes with a different message — a letter from USC Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman. 
The letter, dated Aug. 20 and addressed to the Trojan Family, announced that a “new era in outstanding student health” is underway on a campus still reeling from reports that a campus doctor had been abusing students for decades.
“I have focused on improving both the care we provide as well as our ability to improve students’ health and well-being so they can achieve their personal and professional goals,” Van Orman said in the letter. “This summer’s developments in the investigations of former gynecologist George Tyndall makes it imperative that this work continues in earnest.”
Since a Los Angeles Times report in May uncovered over 30 years of sexual abuse allegations against Tyndall, more than 380 people have sued USC. Amid outrage from students, faculty and alumni, the University opened an investigation into its response, restructured the Board of Trustees and removed President C. L. Max Nikias. 
Now, at the start of the new academic year, the University has introduced changes at the Engemann Student Health Center in an effort to rebuild trust among the student body and prevent behavior like Tyndall’s from occurring. But some students, whether individually or as part of organizations like Undergraduate Student Government, are taking matters into their own hands. 
“USC is at the brink of major culture change, and I think change can also start with one person,” said USG President Debbie Lee.

Changes at the health center

In her letter, Van Orman announced that USC is “strengthening … communications to students about their rights and responsibilities” by introducing a guide to sensitive medical examinations, requiring medical assistants to be present for certain appointments and providing a phone translation service in multiple languages. She stressed that student health staff received “extensive” training on complaint reporting over the past year and that concerns about physicians would be reviewed immediately by the health center’s leadership.
Since the Times’ report about Tyndall, USC opened an online feedback form for students to report concerns with the quality of care at the health center. In addition, the University hired two female gynecologists to replace Tyndall, who was suspended in 2016 and forced to resign following an internal investigation into allegations.
“I have focused on improving both the care we provide as well as our ability to improve students’ health and well-being… ” — Sarah Van Orman, Chief Health Officer
Van Orman, who joined the student health staff in August 2017, said these steps are part of an ongoing effort to rebuild patients’ trust. 
“There’s a lot of interest in how we set the gold standard in student health,” Van Orman said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We’re working hard here, hiring a lot of folks, but we really want to have what we need here to make sure that we’re taking the best care of students.”
Anne Michels, one of the two newly hired gynecologists, graduated from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 2000 and completed her residency at New York Presbyterian Hospital in 2004. She spent 14 years at Kaiser Permanente, treating patients and reviewing complaints to improve care. 
In March, Michels applied to practice gynecology at Engemann, but when news of Tyndall’s misconduct broke, she said she had to think more carefully about what she wanted to accomplish. 
“I thought … maybe I should take this awful, upsetting thing that happened and try to make a big change, make a difference, make the quality of the protocols and the care experience better,” Michels said.

Michels along with USC’s other new gynecologist Deirdre Logan, will have a role that includes talking to students about contraception and sexual health, testing for sexually transmitted infections and performing routine exams necessary for women’s health. Michels said she will help educate patients on what to expect in any of these scenarios and help build the patients’ trust with Engemann staff. 
“I show people things, I communicate what are the side effects, what are the risks,” Michels said. “I think that it may take a while, but hopefully … just with time, students will feel more comfortable, safe, empowered and educated.”

Searching for reform
Meanwhile, hundreds of current and former students who have accused Tyndall of unprofessional or abusive behavior are suing the University. 
Mai Mizuno, a senior majoring in international relations and philosophy, politics and law, was one of the last patients to see Tyndall before he was placed on administrative leave on June 2016. 
Then a freshman, Mizuno went to Tyndall for a consultation on a brand of birth control she takes to alleviate her migraines. He recommended that she get a pelvic examination done since she’d never had one before. When Tyndall took her to the examination room and asked her to undress, Mizuno said she remembered that there was no chaperone with them.
“He then groped my breasts and my lower stomach and then … [inserted] his hand inside of me,” Mizuno said. “There was a lot of cognitive dissonance because it felt like rape in a sense, it felt like a very sexual thing that was happening.”
Mizuno said the questions Tyndall asked during the examination were also inappropriate and “divorced from the medical setting.” 
“Do you use lube when you have sex?” she recalled him asking. “How many times have you had sex before? What do you feel like when you have sex?”
“It really destroyed me,” Mizuno said. “He seemed like this extremely accredited gynecologist and for this to be happening was so weird, and I still can’t wrap my head around it.” 
For the next two years, Mizuno remained silent about her experience with Tyndall and started seeing a gynecologist off campus.
A few weeks after the Los Angeles Times report came out, she joined a class-action lawsuit against the University, from which she found a “cohort of fellow students [and alumnae] who had undergone this similar trauma.” Mizuno was also one of the women interviewed by the district attorney’s office, which is preparing a criminal case against Tyndall.
“There were unfortunately thousands of women who also had gone through the same thing, my question is why?” Mizuno said. “Why had this, how had this gone on for so long? And why were we not protected?”
Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso announced that USC is investigating its response to the allegations against Tyndall, and has hired law firm O’Melveny & Myers LLP to conduct the investigation under attorneys Apalla Chopra and Steve Olsen. Chopra has represented universities in legal challenges such as Title IX and Clery Act investigations, as well as sexual assault allegations.
According to her website, Chopra has represented Claremont McKenna College in lawsuits that challenged the enforcement of the institution’s sexual misconduct policy. She also led a summary judgment victory for Harvard University in a Title IX lawsuit alleging that the school “failed to respond appropriately” to a student’s sexual assault allegations.
Mizuno commended Van Orman’s letter for establishing measures for greater transparency and accountability at Engemann, but said that she will “believe it when [she sees]” changes come to fruition.
“Once I graduate this May, that will mark an end to the era of victimization,” Mizuno said. “I hope that the next generation of students are protected, that their interests are put forward before the interests of private individuals within our administration and before the image of the University that everyone has been trying to uphold.”

United for a cause
In response to the allegations against Tyndall, students like USG Sen. Michaela Murphy have also taken action. She aims to work with USG to update the resources listed on the back of the USC ID cards to include contact information for the Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services. 
“They have a hotline you can call, and it allows you to speak to a crisis counselor,” Murphy said. “So in a time of crisis or an emergency, you have something just in your back pocket.”
According to Lee, USG collaborated with the Graduate Student Government and the Office of Campus Wellness and Crisis Intervention to host three “connection sessions” open to students during the first and second weeks of the school year, with the last one taking place on Aug. 29. 
The sessions allowed students to have discussions about the events that occurred, as the news broke during the summer when most students were not able to immediately come together for support, Murphy said. The Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, Murphy said, is also planning to host another open forum sometime in September, though an official date has yet to be announced. 
Aside from USG, Murphy has been updating the Society of Women and the Law, of which she is president, to have each month spotlight a certain area of the law. For September, she chose to highlight sexual harassment and assault case law, which she said was most relevant to USC and the news about Tyndall. 
Throughout September, attorneys and speakers will talk about their experiences in the club meetings. She also plans to rent out The Lorenzo movie theater to host a screening of “Seeing Allred,” a documentary detailing the life of renowned women’s rights lawyer Gloria Allred, who is also representing women against Tyndall and USC.
“It makes me hopeful that so many different organizations on our campus are trying to take the initiative to say, ‘How can we help?’” Murphy said. “It’s been reassuring to see student leaders on our campus, to see different organizations on our campus say, ‘Maybe this is an opportunity for us to step in.’”
USC has also encouraged students to voice their thoughts at a series of town-hall style forums organized by the Division of Student Affairs. In a letter sent to the student body on Aug. 27, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry said that these Student Conversations are intended for students and administrators to “share important updates, discuss concerns and ask questions.” 
But for the first Student Conversation on Aug. 30, Carry said that issues specifically relating to Tyndall’s conduct could not be discussed due to the ongoing nature of the investigation.
“I think this time has proven that we need each other to move forward,” Lee said. “I think [you] just [need] to be an encouragement to your fellow peers while also holding onto what you are passionate about and bringing that onto campus.”

The Arts District in Downtown has gone from a gritty neighborhood full of industrial buildings and business complexes to the new creative hotspot in town. Located minutes from Little Tokyo on the eastern side of Downtown, the Arts District is a neighborhood with a rich history and even richer culture. From delicious restaurants to trendy art galleries, there’s something for everyone. Here are some lesser known spots in the Arts District that are worth checking out. 
House of Woo
209 S Garey St.
Although fashion designer Staci Woo has been running her company out of downtown L.A. since the late ‘90s, she only recently opened House of Woo, a classic Los Angeles boutique offering design workshops in addition to classic, beachy staples and installations that help bring out one’s inner designer. The unisex clothing shop on South Garey Street has been bringing a sunnier disposition to the Arts District for years.
Art Share L.A.
801 E 4th Pl.
This 28,000 square foot warehouse immediately catches the eye with its colorful mural exterior. Art Share L.A. serves as a home to dozens of artists by providing affordable lofts where they can simultaneously live and work. In addition to being a place of residence, the warehouse’s bottom floor has creative facilities such as a theater, art studios, classrooms and art galleries. It’s a great place to visit with friends and learn more about Los Angeles’ thriving artist community.
A+D Museum
900 E 4th St.
After moving from Los Angeles’ Museum Row in the summer of 2015, A+D Architecture and Design Museum found its home in the creative hub of the Arts District. Currently, A+D is the only museum in L.A. to have continuous exhibitions focused on architecture and design. Some of its current exhibits include “Wireframes: The Visualization of Architecture” and “Architecture in Perspective.” There is no admission fee but its website recommends a $10 donation.
The Pie Hole 
714 Traction Ave.
Food is as essential to life as art, so students should definitely stop by The Pie Hole for a delicious slice of pie to keep them going on their tour of the Arts District. From sweet classics like Key Lime and Blueberry Crumble to  more dynamic dishes such as the Cheeseburger Pot Pie, there’s something for everyone at this classic American pie shop. With “Happiness, One Slice At A Time” as its motto, it’s no surprise that The Pie Hole is solidifying its status as a quintessential dessert destination in the Arts District.
The Factory Kitchen 
1300 Factory Pl.
With colorful murals and eye-catching graffiti, the streets and sidewalks of the Arts District can be easily overwhelming. The Factory Kitchen’s stark opposition to the vividness of the streets is exactly what makes it stand out. This renovated industrial spot is home to some of the most coveted pasta in Downtown — divine cannolis, house made pasta and focaccia — and is a must-visit to satisfy any Italian food cravings.

Located in the same plaza as Spudnuts and Tutti Frutti, Pot of Cha is the latest milk tea shop to open doors near USC’s campus. Customers also have the option to control their drink’s sugar. (Jonathon Xue | Daily Trojan)
Teapot lamps hanging from the ceiling and wooden plaques engraved with the origins of their ingredients make it clear that tea means business at Pot of Cha.
“Cha,” or “tea” in Chinese, is the key to this small shop, and the three of the shop’s four premier teas come from Nantou, a province in central Taiwan, while the jasmine green tea leaves are from Vietnam.
Milk tea, which originates from Taiwan, has seen a recent increase in popularity in the United States as chains such as Gong Cha, Coco and Happy Lemon continue to pop up all around the country. Local chain It’s Boba Time and Figueroa Street staple Cup O’ Joy were the most accessible  milk tea shops to USC students prior to Pot of Cha’s opening. Now, Pot of Cha, located on Figueroa Street in the same plaza as Spudnuts and Tutti Frutti, will appeal to those living north of campus and those who love quality milk tea. 
For tea connoisseurs, Pot of Cha is definitely the clear winner. The Red Ruby premium black milk tea with brown sugar gives a jolt of caffeine along with a satisfying sugar rush. It’s no wonder that the drink is one of Cha’s top-selling items.
Sugar levels can be adjusted to 80, 50 or 30 percent, while ice levels can be changed to less, half or no ice. As a general rule of thumb, less sugar and less ice is a sure way to make sure one’s drink isn’t overly sweet, and the tea’s taste is more pronounced.
Customers can add classic toppings such as pearls, pudding and herb jelly, or other ingredients like mini pearls, basil seeds and ice cream to add more texture to their drinks. In addition to giving one’s drink an extra kick or crunch, the toppings taste delicious.
The Golden Phoenix green milk tea provides a lighter taste for those who prefer a sweet drink. It tastes just a little bit stronger than a typical jasmine green milk tea from It’s Boba Time, especially when you adjust the sweetness level.
Two other best sellers are the Okinawa black milk tea and the mango green tea. The mocha-colored Okinawa may be a bit too sweet for some tastes, but it gets the job done.Also, the mango green tea more resembles a thin mango juice. 
For a more smoothie-like drink, try the taro with milk ice blended with red bean, another best seller. Lower the sweetness level to really bring out the taro flavor. Or don’t. It’s whatever one’s preference is.
During its soft opening, Pot of Cha is offering up to a 40 percent discount on orders, determined by a wheel spin. 
For now, students and University Park residents have a brand new option to satisfy their cravings. At this location,  at least, customers can expect some authenticity in their milk tea.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Chef Roy Choi’s attempt at revolution, once as incendiary and bright as a firework among Los Angeles restaurants, has fizzled into darkness. 
Both the Watts and San Jose locations of his healthy fast-food concept LocoL have shuttered after about two years of operation, having been  beaten down by other restaurateurs, the Watts community and critical media (famously receiving a zero-star review from The New York Times). But LocoL burst with such fiery hopefulness that even in its last few months, standing on a broken leg and gushing, the place still seemed to smile.
I visited LocoL twice in May, and was fortunate enough to have met Choi during one of them. I wrote something about him then, which I believe rings even truer now.
As my friend and I pushed through the restaurant’s door, two voices struck me with the same eagerness as an Apple retail employee: “Hello, welcome to LocoL!”
Roy Choi, who was previously leaning against the pick-up counter and probably chatting with the employee behind the register, now stood with open arms — a welcoming gesture in an empty restaurant. I smiled, unsure if he really was Roy Choi or just some hired help greeting the customers. The Stussy shirt and ink-ornamented arms, however, were undeniable indentifiers of the celebrity chef. 
As we placed our orders, Choi backed away from us into the corner of the room. His eyes scanned the multiple TV monitors, the walls and eventually us. His phone slid between his hands before his back pocket, a habit of boredom or a nervous tick. I got the strawberry lemonade agua fresca, the greens and a bean and cheese foldie, unable to focus on what I was doing and moreso fascinated by Choi’s every movement. 
“Hey, I don’t mean to bother you, but can I get a picture?” I asked, in such deep dissociation that I felt like I was watching myself from the opposite end of the restaurant. He stared at me for a moment, and I began to panic: What if this actually wasn’t celebrity chef Roy Choi and instead some random customer that I have chosen to harass? 
“Of course!” We both forced a smile as I took the photo. 
“How often do you stop by here?” I asked. “I’m sure you’re very busy.”
“I come here whenever I have the time,” he laughed a bit. “Today, I have some time.”
“What are you doing the rest of today?” Now I’m going around asking his personal information. Great job, Chrissy. “You don’t need to answer that if it’s too personal.”
“No, no, it’s fine. I’m gonna stay here for another 30 minutes or so, then go to the beach before cooking dinner at my restaurant A-Frame.”
“Oh, A-Frame! Bomb pancakes.” I had never even been to A-Frame. I was lying! I was straight up lying. (Note: I have now actually been to A-Frame. The pancakes are indeed bomb.)
He smiled at this. “Really? Thank you!”
“So the beach?” 
“Yeah, I go there to clear my head. I usually go after going here.”
“Yeah, I would be stressed out too if I were you.” 
“Well, someone has to do it,” he responded with the same smile.
Though Choi had a warm demeanor, his weariness was almost breathable.
While I sat, Choi wandered through the kitchen and eating area, almost lacking purpose; just staring, perhaps full of thought. He sat in the back of the restaurant for almost the entirety of my time there, on his phone or looking around. At one point, I mentioned that the agua fresca was good, and he appeared immediately at my side to get me a refill. 
I say very little besides praise for LocoL within earshot of Choi, despite the fact that my meal was dripping fifty shades of grease and was the very opposite of healthy. But, since the restaurant is now occupied by six people (three employees, Choi, my friend and myself), everything I said was within earshot of Choi.
But I felt like he knew what I was really thinking. As I chatted about the food and each element that was unique or flavorful, Choi grieved as he took in the state of his dream social project. He stared out the window at Watts like it was a forlorn lover. And in a way, it was.
It was hard to ignore the population difference outside of LocoL and on the streets. People buzzed around on sidewalks, walking to the school or the store, leaning in the shade, smoking cigarettes and enjoying their routines. The people of Watts are energetic yet inviting. And while Watts is a food desert, LocoL is a culture desert. I doubt that the person who scrawled “F-ck LocoL” on the wall of the women’s restroom was a devout Choi follower from WeHo. 
When our class got off the Watts station before heading to LocoL just a few days later, a handful of people working at a corner store shouted, “Welcome to Watts!” at us as we passed by. It was loud, yes, and perhaps overly aggressive, but earnest. 
It reminded me immediately of my conversation with Choi. As we parted ways to go sit, he also told us, “Welcome to Watts.” It was a line, repeated over and over again at white customers who betrayed the very core idea of what LocoL was, but were the likely lifeblood keeping the project afloat. Instead of nourishing Watts, a neighborhood without a grocery store, LocoL fed visitors expensive, greasy meals masqueraded as a vehicle for social change. 
What part of Choi feels like he can welcome us to Watts? At the end of the day, he’s just as uninvited there as we are. Rest in peace, LocoL (2015 –— 2018).

In many ways, education is the bedrock of society. Our most praised authors and most talented engineers have gotten where they are largely because they had teachers who taught them the skills and values they practice on a daily basis. 
We champion our best scientists for medical breakthroughs and fancy new inventions, but we rarely think about the mentors that led them to those breakthroughs by teaching them essentials  that built the foundation of the rest of their life’s work — from reading and writing to critical thinking skills. 
They play such an essential role in making our society function, yet they are often paid poorly and not taken seriously by administrators. The United States is currently facing a nationwide teacher shortage because of poor working conditions that make them feel unable to effectively teach their students. 
For the past couple of months, tension has been building between the Los Angeles Unified School District and United Teachers Los Angeles because of these issues. The teachers’ demands are very basic. 
According to the Los Angeles Times, they want to limit class sizes (California currently ranks 48th in teacher-student ratio), hire full-time librarians and nurses, cap the student-to-counselor ratio at 500:1 and receive 6.5 percent pay increase, among other proposals. 
It’s surprising that most of these proposals aren’t already school policies — it is very difficult for students to learn in environments where they can’t access librarians, can’t go to a nurse if they’re hurt and can’t talk to counselors about their classes. Large class sizes often prevent students from accessing their teachers, too, and make it harder for teachers to effectively do their jobs. 
The pay increase they are demanding isn’t even a large one — the 2017 average teacher salary was $75,350, according to the Los Angeles Times, and a 6.5 percent increase would bring that to about $80,250. Underpaying teachers perpetuates some of the problems that constantly plague public education — teacher shortages, low staff retention rates and underqualified teachers. Students cannot be expected to succeed if their teachers are not given fair compensation. 
On top of that, just last year, the members of the L.A. Board of Education, whose pay is determined by a LAUSD committee, received a 174 percent pay increase. Board members now earn $125,000 per year. 
Teachers shouldn’t have to fight this hard to fulfill their basic needs. The LAUSD says the demands are unreasonable, leading UTLA to vote to authorize a strike. This doesn’t mean teachers will definitely strike, but union leaders can call for a strike at any time without calling their members to another vote. 
The vote is mainly a pressure tactic, but if the district and UTLA still fail to reach a decision, a strike is a real possibility. And strikes are highly effective — earlier this year, thousands of teachers went on strike in West Virginia, Oklahoma and other states as part of the #RedforEd campaign. Their demands, including pay raises, were ultimately met.
But we should avoid a strike in L.A., because it doesn’t just pressure the district into meeting demands — it also means students lose one or more days of instruction, so hopefully the strike authorization is enough to make LAUSD negotiate a fairer contract. 
At the same time, however, the problem isn’t entirely LAUSD’s fault. According to Education Week’s Quality Counts, California ranks 46th in per-pupil spending in the nation, despite being the richest state. Funding for education is funding for the future of the state and nation; if the population is not investing in its students, it can’t expect to produce future generations of creative thinkers and meticulous researchers that will drive innovation and progress. 
I’ve never understood why teachers aren’t as highly appreciated as the hundreds of bright young minds they shape every day of their careers. I think we should revere our teachers and provide them the resources and environment they need to be successful — not create untenable teaching conditions that are causing teachers across the nation to strike.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
The standard elementary school health class instilled the dangers of smoking cigarettes: rapid aging, horrific black lungs, a possible permanent hole in your neck just to breathe and even death. When talking to the average young adult, it seems like these lessons actually made a difference. “Cigarettes are gross,” they may say, “I just JUUL.”
The potential person living under a rock may ask, “What’s a JUUL?” JUUL is a small, sleek electronic cigarette that was introduced by PAX Labs in 2015. It can easily be mistaken as a high-end flash drive, and can be charged from any USB port.
JUULing should not be a trendy status symbol; it is a health risk. Just as how we disdainfully regard the rampant cigarette addictions among our parents’ generation, and can see the harmful effects taking shape now, soon our own children will do the same — if nicotine-borne reproductive issues don’t stop JUULing students from having kids of their own in the first place.
But the device is a force to be reckoned with. JUUL’s fast growth contrasts dramatically with its fellow e-cigarette competitors. The device’s retail sales exceed $100 million quarterly and $650 million every year. It is the largest e-cigarette brand on the market, taking up more than half the e-cigarette retail market share, according to a study jointly conducted by Georgia State University and the University of Chicago.
PAX Labs claims that JUUL products are targeted toward adult cigarette smokers wishing to get off nicotine for good. The device supposedly mimics the feeling of smoking a real cigarette with only five ingredients: glycerol, propylene glycol, nicotine, benzoic acid and food-grade flavoring. Looking around the average high school or university, however, and one will find their supposed plan took a direction of its own. 
Many USC students, who probably never had a nicotine addiction in their lives, can be found JUULing in their rooms, at parties or even in lecture halls, inhaling from the device and then dipping their heads into backpacks or sweaters so professors don’t notice the plumes of vapor in the air. A lot of them even add a little personal touch to the tiny e-cigarette, with colorful stickers or artistic etchings. 
It is hard to blame students for their JUULing habit. The refreshing menthol or fruit-flavored nicotine is both a stimulant and relaxant. It can get someone going during a rough morning and calm them down when anxiety hits — but it’s also as chemically addictive as cocaine or heroin, according to the National Institute of Health. 
Nicotine use issues don’t merely end with addiction. Nicotine is also a carcinogen, linked to increased susceptibility to four types of cancer: lung, gastrointestinal, pancreatic and breast. It weakens the immune system, can lead to erectile dysfunction and impair menstrual cycles and fertility. Any beneficial effects of nicotine are yet to be proven.
Each JUUL pod has the nicotine equivalence of a pack of cigarettes, according to the company’s website. Students finishing at least one JUUL pod a day essentially smoke at least a pack of cigarettes a day.
Researchers have no public data on the effects of long-term JUUL use, mainly because the product has only existed for such a short period of time. This is even more concerning, as present JUUL smokers will be the test subjects for a product that surely will reveal negative effects after long-term usage. 
An addiction that is so preventable doesn’t belong in the great minds of students who have and continue to achieve so much in their academic and life pursuits. Common issues such as anxiety and grogginess also come with a plethora of healthier, less self-destructive remedies alternative to JUULing: meditation, exercise and a healthier diet are only a few examples.
In the age of instant gratification, it can be so easy to resort to a tiny flash drive with a pretty colorful light as a temporary cure to recurring issues — but we know better, and can definitely do better, than to plummet into big tobacco’s obvious and sinister trap.
Big tobacco: the mighty behemoth that already has the blood of 480,000 Americans every year on its hands, according to the Center for Disease Control, does not deserve our attention — much less our precious time and business.
“My life may be an absolute mess,” Twitter user Ariel Rose tweeted, “but at least I don’t have a nicotine addiction from a flash drive.”
