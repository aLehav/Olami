On Thursday, the Price School of Public Policy held a discussion about the effects that the recent Paris terrorist attacks will have on U.S. national security policy.
The event, entitled “The Paris Massacre: What are the implications for the U.S.?” featured Dr. Erroll Southers, director of transition and research deployment at the CREATE National Research Center, and Dr. Raphael Bostic, director of the Judith and John Bedrosian Center on Governance and the Public Enterprise.
The panelists divided the discussion into three segments: Paris, the United States and future international governance.
Southers, an expert on homegrown terrorism, provided his view on the events in Paris.
“Paris has been challenging for some time,” Southers said. “You have a really interesting dynamic there, where you have a very large collection of Muslims, the largest population of Jews outside of Israel and a growth of both anti-Islamic and anti-Semitic sentiment.”
Southers also explained how the Paris shooting reflected the inefficacy of our current counterterrorism strategy.
“I was not surprised of the [Paris] attacks. Just look at the numbers. French intelligence knew of three to five thousand radicalized Muslims living in France. But you need 20 to 25 agents to properly monitor a suspect,” Southers said.
A possible solution to terrorism, Southers argued, would have to come not from the government, but from the vulnerable communities themselves — what he called a change in our present “top-down” mentality.
Bostic suggested a different form of addressing the dangers of terrorism: “De-evolution of governance. There is a tendency to tell the lower levels what to do, but we should actually be letting them dictate policy. If you do not engage the constituents, they do not own the policy and they won’t help you.”
Southers also explained how he is currently working to implement this policy in a burgeoning national initiative that would include Los Angeles, Boston and Minneapolis as pilot cities.
“We are really trying to become an equal partner with the people in the community and figure out what we can do about it. It takes a network to defeat a network. Terrorism is all local. Terrorists have families and live in communities. That’s why 40 percent of successful arrests related to terrorism come from people calling up,” Southers said.
Another policy issue discussed by the panel was the tendency to profile terrorists as originating from certain places.
“We tend to think of terrorists as coming from other countries, what I call ‘tourist terrorists.’ But some people that don’t necessarily have personal links discover these connections and become radicalized,” Bostic said.
Southers noted that the terrorists that targeted Paris this year and Madrid in 2004 were nationals of the countries they attacked.
“I was not surprised that the Paris attackers were French. In the Madrid bombing they were all Spaniards. These organizations are recruiting from the homeland,” Southers said.
Southers explained that the public’s unwillingness to cooperate with Muslim communities was also concerning.
Some of the students present at the discussion agreed with Southers’ community-based approach to fighting terrorism .
“I think it’s all about framing the dialogue in a way that communities feel they have ownership in the solution,” said Justine Dodgen, a graduate student studying public administration. “They must feel that the government is supporting them so that they don’t turn to terrorist organizations for recruitment.”
“One of the best parts of the talk was hearing Southers’ views on how we perceive terrorism,” said Jeremy Loudenback, a graduate student studying public policy. “We use certain code words that are misleading, such as labeling someone a ‘lone wolf attacker’ instead of a ‘terrorist attacker.’ We need to figure out how to properly designate someone as a terrorist.”
 
Let’s get real here.  The terrorists are all devout Muslims.  That is the common denominator.  They may be Muslims born as Spanish, or French or any other citizenry, but THE common denominator is their passionate adherence to Islam, jihad and the spread of the caliphate.

Silicon Valley entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel visited the Wallis Annenberg Hall Thursday evening for an open discussion about his ideas on competition, progress and technology.
The event began with a speech by Thiel on his No. 1 New York Times bestselling book, Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future, and was followed by a Q&A led by Annenberg Director Willow Bay.
Thiel listed successful businesses such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft as examples of companies that are so unique that they have effectively dominated and monopolized their respective industries.
Thiel holds a long list of accolades, serving as the co-founder of Paypal and Palantir and is the first outside investor and director of Facebook.
“PayPal came from a motivating idea combining cryptography and finance,” Thiel said. “The world is not only composed of those [ideas] that are conventional and those that are called impossible mysteries, but I think there are a lot in between.”
During his speech, Thiel talked about how characterizing startups in terms of set buzzwords, such as “big data,” is a big mistake. He said doing so would put the startup into a space where there is crazy competition and a lack of differentiation.
Austen Myers, a junior majoring in business administration, is starting a UI/UX (user interface and user experience) club this semester that will attempt to spread awareness of design-thinking and topics in computer-human interaction.
“I came to this event because I’ve always been interested in startups, and Peter Thiel has always been one of those key figures within the scene,” Myers said. “I know he’s a very knowledgeable person and best selling author, and I just wanted to expand my knowledge-side in another subject.”
Thiel said that he and his group have invested in 150 to 200 companies over several years. During the Q&A session, Thiel talked about why Silicon Valley has been such a successful location for startups. He mentioned the combination of good weather, infrastructure, an open culture and a history of innovation that makes the area very appealing.
“I really liked the part about monopoly versus competition in that competition is a negative thing in terms of trying to make it after college,” said Julia Cox, a junior majoring in communication. “I grew up in an environment where competition was definitely the thing to do in order to get to the next step. So to hear somebody who is successful say that being the most competitive is not something you necessarily want to be, because that will get you to where everyone else is going, is really enlightening.”
Thiel delivered his speech in the auditorium, and it was   streamed on a two-story screen.
“It was an extraordinary opportunity to hear from one of the great entrepreneurs today. The fact that we could host him in Wallis Annenberg Hall, have him deliver his remarks in the auditorium, which was nice and cozy with perfect audio, but then live-stream it in the two-story screen and open it up to everybody else who wanted to come and listen was a phenomenal opportunity for the school,” said Bay.
Bay said she thought Thiel’s book has a very distinctive point of view about the importance of breakthroughs.
“I think Peter’s advice is really interesting regarding his notion that competition is actually a bad thing. It erodes profits and creates insaneness amongst companies,” she said.

Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett,  has worked alongside a team of staff to design a new general education curriculum composed of eight core requirements and classes composed of 20 students for incoming freshmen starting the school year in fall 2015.
The categories will remain similar, though they will be lettered A through F and will span departments outside of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. In addition to taking classes in the arts, humanities, social sciences, life sciences and physical sciences, students will be required to take a quantitative reasoning class.
Instead of taking six general education classes, new students will  be required to take eight. Two new categories will supplement the material currently covered by the diversity requirement. These categories are “Citizenship in the Global Era” and “Traditions and Historical Foundations.”
Dr. Steven Lamy, vice dean of academic programs, explained that the change is not meant to eliminate the previous requirement, but evolve it.
“The new themes will not replace the diversity requirement. Instead, they will deal with the same issues of the diversity theme, but on a broader scale,” Lamy said. “General education courses will have tags indicating these themes. When people choose these, they will satisfy both their general education core classes and their themes.”
Dr. Gene Bickers, vice provost for undergraduate programs, explained that the diversity requirement will involve the study of past and current social issues.
“The ‘Citizenship in the Global Era’ theme will deal with contemporary issues and diversity outside of the United States. Meanwhile, the ‘Traditions and Historical Foundations’ will deal with the past and societal development,” Bickers said. “Students will not need to fulfill these requirements by taking additional classes. Students will fulfill these requirements the same way they complete their diversity theme now.”
Bickers explained that the idea behind this initiative is to provide more rigor and flexibility into the curriculum.
“General education classes will now be incorporating the whole university. Students will be able to fulfill their general education by taking classes in Annenberg, Roski and even Keck,” Bickers said.
Spanning such a wide array of schools, Bickers stressed that students who are not in Dornsife will now have the opportunity to start completing their majors earlier.
Miranda Mazariegos, a sophomore majoring in English who transferred from Boston University, explained that she considers USC’s curriculum to be relatively flexible.
“USC is definitely more flexible in terms of their general education. When I was in BU, I really wanted to double major. As a result of its general education requirements, it was almost impossible for me. In USC, the general education allows you to do more,” Mazariegos said.
The changes will only apply to   freshmen entering USC in fall 2015 or later. Transfer students will not be affected.
Students will also be able to complete one of their core requirements in a class of 20 students, as opposed to the large lecture style of many general education requirements.
“This is great news. This means that freshmen will have at least two small classes during their first year. This can be extremely helpful, given that USC is such a large school,” Lamy said.
Shea Carter, a senior majoring in communication, explained that she would have preferred to be enrolled in general education courses with smaller class sizes.
“When I came to USC, USC’s size was very overwhelming. If I would have had to take classes that were smaller, I would have had the opportunity to meet people and have classes that were more personal,” Carter said.
Bickers explained that this initiative has taken three years to develop and has received significant faculty input.
“Our main intention, though, is to give students more flexibility and provide them with classes that will be relevant to them after they graduate,” Bickers said.
