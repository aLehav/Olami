Content warning: This article contains references to sexual assault and violence. 
Editor’s note: This story was updated with information from LAPD.
Protests continued outside the Sigma Nu fraternity house Friday, two days after the University placed the Sigma Nu fraternity house on interim suspension following multiple drugging and sexual assault reports. 
Former Sigma Nu President Ryan Schiffilea is a “main suspect” in the sexual assault reports, LAPD confirmed to the Daily Trojan Friday. He was questioned by detectives last week, but has not been arrested or charged.
Starting at 12 p.m., students covered the walls of the fraternity with signs reading “Abolish Greek Life,” “You are complacent,” “I believe you” and “President [Carol] Folt, why the fuck are you not doing anything?” 
“Walk into this building remembering the trauma you caused all of them,” one protester wrote on the ground outside Sigma Nu.
Andrea Ortega, a sophomore majoring in law, history and culture, joined the Alpha Chi Omega sorority in August but dropped today. According to Ortega, the sorority told her to not talk about the incident. Following the recommendation from the sorority and other issues , she no longer wishes to contribute, financially or otherwise, to an organization that “protect[s] these men.”
Ortega also said Greek life does not realize the significance of the sexual assault reports.
“I just don’t think that they’re really realizing how important it is,” Ortega said. “They think it’s just gonna die down in like a week or so.” 
Around 1:30 p.m., protesters marched down the Row to the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house — commonly known as PIKE — where a student, Alyssa Delarosa, chanted through a megaphone until fraternity brothers left the house and addressed protesters. 
Carrying a megaphone, Delarosa, a senior majoring in psychology, led the protesters to Pike after hearing stories from multiple women outside Sigma Nu about drugging at other fraternities, specifically at Pike.
Following a discussion between the protesters and Pike, fraternity members joined protesters outside of Sigma Nu, bringing a ladder to hang up signs and talk to the protesters.
When members of Pike first left their houses to talk to the protesters, Delarosa said she was surprised. However, she said “it’s very telling” that the members only left their house once protesters were outside.
“It had to take me basically embarrassing them and calling them out on my little megaphone for them to be willing to do that,” Delarosa said. “We were there all day — we were there from like 3 p.m. to past midnight yesterday. They didn’t come out.”
In interviews with the Daily Trojan, members of Pike said they were not aware of what happened at Sigma Nu before the DPS email and that they will do “everything in [their] power” to stop an assault from happening again. 
In an Instagram post, @abolishgreekusc criticized the University’s response to the allegations that they said “place the burden of preventing rape on the survivor, not the rapist.” The organization also said that, while there will be calls for reform over the next few weeks, abolition is needed.
“We reject those calls for reform and their characterization of the problem; the solution is more simple,” the statement read. “We call for abolition. No more ‘taskforces,’ no more aimless DEI efforts, no more ‘statements regarding X.’ We want you gone. And we want it now.”
A representative for the Abolish Greek life movement said the group aims to address the broader scope of Greek life and the “horrid behavioral tendencies” it allows.
“Even if this house gets kicked off the Row, the issue is the system,” the representative said. “It’s not a question of whether or not you have a certain population of bad apples within the system: It’s the structure itself that creates an environment where horrid things like this can happen.”
Emma Gronstad, a junior majoring in computer and electrical engineering, said that, because fraternities are not punished enough, the problems with assault are “swept under the rug” after the initial reaction. Gronstad also criticized USC’s email about the suspension and assault.
“One thing that really sticks out to me is that the USC email is like ‘Oh, hey, here’s how to not be assaulted.’ I think that was honestly a really insensitive message to send, especially during a time when, you know, the seven girls who reported probably all received that message,” she said. 
In a statement posted on Instagram Friday, the USC chapter of Sigma Nu confirmed that the fraternity suspended a student accused of sexual assault.
Multiple members of the Sigma Nu — including the president and vice president — did not respond for comment.
DPS referred the Daily Trojan to the Los Angeles Police Department, which said no arrests have been made.
Students remained outside the Sigma Nu house at the time of publication. A vigil, as well as a walk from USC Village to Sigma Nu, began at 6 p.m.

Can you believe October is already almost over? Even though this month is flying by at a rapid pace, we can’t forget the reasons we have to celebrate this month. Yes, the entire month of October equals Halloween for many, but it also means commemorating Pilipinx American History Month.    
To celebrate, I compiled a list of six Pilipinx TikTok creators you should be following — many of whom are topping the list of #filipinotiktok, which has 463.5 million views and counting. A few of the creators I chose have intersecting identities in both the Pilipinx community and LGBTQ+ community, which is important to highlight as October is also LGBTQ+ History Month!
@ustheduo — Carissa & Michael Alvarado
If you have never heard of Us The Duo, you are probably living under a rock. This music duo consists of Pilipinx singer Carissa Alvarado and her husband Michael. If you’ve ever watched the animated movie “The Book of Life,” you have probably heard their song “No Matter Where You Are.” Their TikTok account is filled with videos showing off their angelic voices and their cute three-year-old daughter.  
@otakoyakisoba — Olly & Mama LuLu
Name a better mother-son duo, I’ll wait. Olly and Mama Lulu started their TikTok journey almost two years ago when Olly posted a video laughing at his mom’s phone screensaver of a K-drama character. Since then, it has been nothing but pure, wholesome content from them. Their most famous recurring skit (so famous that they made a YouTube compilation) is “Name that Celebrity.” In these videos, Mama Lulu attempts at naming celebrities such as Dua Lipa or, as she calls her, Lipa Dupa. Mama Lulu holds nothing back, often roasting her son Olly and insulting her haters in Tagalog. If you find yourself watching their videos, don’t forget to add your comment to the “EEDJIOT CHAIN” also known as the “idiot chain,” one of the many names that Mama Lulu likes to call her son.  
@aileenchristineee — Aileen Christine
Christine’s videos will make you audibly giggle. Her content frequently features her boyfriend, Deven Chris (@devenchris). She is constantly pulling pranks on him, asking him to do impressions and recreating dance trends together. Most of the time, her pranks are just an excuse to give him a small slap, but other times, they are used as a test for their relationship. Some of my personal favorite videos are when  asks Chris to imitate obscure sounds, such as a vacuum cleaner or orange juice swishing in a bottle, or when Deven acts like a Pilipino mom. Their videos are never a letdown and their energy and laughs are absolutely infectious. 
@ajclementine — AJ Clementine
Clementine’s videos give a glimpse into her experiences as a transgender, Pilipinx woman. On her account, no subject is off limits. She discusses topics of sex, gender, racism and body dysmorphia. A truly safe space for people with intersecting identities, AJ’s videos make you realize that you are not alone with some of the anxieties and experiences you are facing. 
@ay_sean — Sean
Sean’s account is a comedy epicenter for Pilipinx communities. He has found a way to make funny and relatable content of the Pilipinx experience. Joking about Pilipinx parties or POVs of getting yelled at by his Asian mom, his videos will make Pilipinx and non-Pilipinx people alike laugh about everyday occurrences that happen in most people’s households. Not only that, Sean has found a way to make the not-so-lighthearted subject of colonization into comical videos about the connection between Mexican and Pilipinx culture. 
@thelizjane — Liz Jane
If you want to learn more about Pilipinx culture, Liz Jane is the person to follow. Her entire account consists of videos teaching viewers about everything and anything Pilipinx. Whether you are curious about what Pilipino snacks to buy on your next trip to the grocery store or about the origins of Pilipinx American History Month, Jane definitely has a series of TikToks on the subject. 
@virginia_please — Jethro Patalinghug
Patalinghug combines drag and TikTok to educate viewers on all topics, including #BIPOC, #AAPI and #LGBTQIA+, according to his bio. While in his drag persona, Virginia Please, Patalinghug also discusses important topics such as coronavirus vaccinations, voting and women’s rights. If you don’t feel educated enough on these topics and feel apprehensive to ask people, Patalinghug’s account is a great starting point.

Never has the slight shaking of a recliner seat, rush of sound coming from overhead speakers and projected images on a large theater screen sent more chills through my body. Separate from the slight draft inside the TCL Chinese Theater in Hollywood, the chill going up and down my spine as I sat in that dark theater had more to do with the absolute spectacle that is “Dune.”
At the beginning of the film, as the action first gets going, the young protagonist Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is told “dreams make good stories, but everything happens when you’re awake” and believe me when I say that you will have no trouble staying awake for this one. 
Director Denis Villeneuve, who previously directed “Arrival” and “Blade Runner 2049,” first picked up the novel of the same name when he was 14 years old, immediately becoming fascinated by the story of a young boy setting foot in a dangerous new world. When the opportunity came up 40 years later to bring Frank Herbert’s classic science-fiction novel to the big screen, it was a no-brainer. 
“Dune” has a long history of being a cursed project as many past directors have attempted to do the book justice but to no avail. Villeneuve was aware of the book’s reputation when he took it up and yet something about this version clicked. Perhaps it was through shooting on location in Hungary, Jordan, Abu Dhabi and Norway or the incredibly stacked cast including Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Jason Momoa, and Oscar Isaac; but for the first time, a film was finally able to capture the incredible scope of Herbert’s novel. 
The film follows the story of young noble Atreides whose family must travel to the dangerous new planet of Arrakis in order to ensure their future. However, once there, Atreides and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) must deal with betrayal and an intergalactic power struggle at a scale unlike anything Star Wars has seen before, all the while Atreides copes with a destiny he has yet to comprehend.
Atreides’ unknown destiny is a recurring source of anxiety for him, as he deals with the growing hostility of an unknown planet and meets desert warrior Chaney (Zendaya), he is compelled to slowly assume a messiah-like role, the future of which he only gets glimpses of in his dreams.
Though based in the year 10191 and written in the year 1965, the story’s themes are eerily pertinent to the present day. In a roundtable interview with Chalamet and Zendaya, Chalamet expanded on the film’s modern relevance. 
“Its themes remain really relevant of fighting for what’s right socially, environmentally, and standing up for groups that are easily oppressed,” Chalamet said.
Reading the book beforehand is definitely recommended, as the plethora of different planet and character names does create some confusion if one is not fully versed in the “Dune” universe. 
However, whatever confusion is created in terms of a complicated plot is made up through the film’s pure scope and scale. “Dune’s” visual effects and cinematography are unparalleled, accentuated by enormous starships and massive desert worms that will forever change your view on the species. 
“I was in a constant state of being awestruck,” Chalamet said. “It makes you feel small in the very best kind of way.”
Beyond epic intergalactic wars and monster sandworms, the film is “all about the human emotion,” Zendaya said. 
“Having to grow up a little quicker — I can relate to that in a massive way,” she said. 
Particularly relating to the climate crisis occurring during the film on the planet of Arrakis and how comparable it is to the one occurring a little closer to home, the film questions how much responsibility one needs to assume to help solve the problem. 
“The issue is how to care without completely destroying yourself,” Zendaya said. “How much am I supposed to care before it’s crippling? How do I live and enjoy things and yet also care? … That’s a battle that both characters deal with quite a bit.”
Zendaya and Chalamet are hopeful that their presence in the film will draw in a younger audience to the decades-old story. 
“If young people can relate to what Chaney or Paul are going through at the center of it — then we’ve succeeded,” Chalamet said. “Transposing a story from the ‘60s and … having it be available to a generation that relates to the qualities in a lot of ways is powerful.” 
Despite the film coming in at an easy 2.5 hours, it almost feels as though it is cut short. The film exasperatingly ends right as all the pieces seem to finally be coming together, though perhaps this is part of Villeneuve’s plan.
“Dune” is split into two parts à la “Avengers: Infinity War,” and audiences will most likely be kept eagerly waiting for a couple of years for the second part. But put down your handkerchiefs and kleenexes for the moment being. As Zendaya’s character pronounces in the film’s dying moments, “this is only the beginning.”
“Dune” comes out in theaters Oct. 22 and is available for streaming on HBO Max Oct. 21.

Los Angeles-based artist Ken Gonzales-Day discussed his ongoing series, “Erased Lynching,” Thursday at the USC Fisher Museum of Art. Invited as part of the museum’s Fall 2021 exhibition “Art and hope at the end of the Tunnel,” Gonzales-Day talked about the history of lynching’s erasure in California, particularly of Latinx people. 
Comparing the crowds from the Jan. 6 Capitol Hill riot to the crowds of people in photographs of lynchings, Gonzales-Day focused on the prevalence of racially motivated violence to date.
“I was surprised that we hadn’t evolved or changed in basically 100 years, and that there’s still that sense of excitement and hurting people and public acts of violence that are, if not directly racially motivated, at least racially informed,” Gonzales-Day said.
The “Erased Lynching” exhibition presents historic photographs taken at lynchings, which have been digitally altered by Gonzales-Day to remove the victim and the rope, guiding the viewer to focus on the crowd in the image. The technique is used to make spectators think about the racial undertones of the act. The photographs came from diverse sources, such as postcards, newspapers and archived images.
Removing the victims from the photographs was important, not only to refocus the images, but also to avoid revictimizing the victims, Gonzales-Day said.
“You can kill somebody only once, but if you want to make it a lasting thing for them, take a picture of it so you continue to inflict pain,” Gonzales-Day said.
Gonzales-Day started his research for this project around 20 years ago by reading different California newspapers from 1849 to 1879. But because of the newspapers’ age and the unclear nature of records, his research proved to be a challenge. Nonetheless, the series now includes more than 60 images, and Gonzales-Day does not plan to stop his research.
As a Mexican American, Gonzales-Day said the project allowed him to reflect on the xenophobia he experienced growing up. It made him realize that it was not his fault but a systemic problem that is more than a hundred years old.
“You’re used to being called names and being treated differently growing up. I always felt bad about that and never understood why or how that was happening. I felt like it was my fault,” Gonzales-Day said. “The project helped me to work through that and realize, ‘No, this isn’t my fault. We’ve been here a long time. We were part of the country. We helped build the country.’”
Gonzales-Day also developed a self-guided walking tour of the lynching locations in downtown Los Angeles. However, he was able to identify locations throughout the entire state. This was surprising for Claire Smerdan, a sophomore majoring in computer science and business who attended the event.
“I grew up in the Bay Area, and to see these lynchings happen in places that I know really well was very disturbing,” Smerdan said.
Additionally, by focusing on the Latinx demographic, the event provided a perspective unknown to some attendees, such as Jessica Stacey, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law who attended the event.
“I didn’t actually know much about Latinos being lynched, so I think it was super important and definitely a very informative way to bring these pictures to life by removing the bodies and focusing on the people involved,’’ Stacey said.
The event also allowed attendees to consider the importance of learning about the different acts of violence that have been committed throughout history. For Smerdan, this helped her reflect on the importance of events like this one.
“I think it’s really important to learn about history because these events still influence our current time, as well when you study history … it helps us prevent them from happening again in the future,” Smerdan said.

Point guard Russell Westbrook’s final statline in his Los Angeles Lakers debut: 8 points, 5 rebounds, 4 assists, 4-13 from the field, 0-4 from the three-point line and 3 turnovers. 
The Lakers probably got the worst version of “Westbrick” possible. 
During the Lakers season opener against the Golden State Warriors, I wanted to hide my face behind my hands as I watched the nine-time All Star barrelling into packed lanes, forcing up contested jumpers and looking discombobulated and out of sorts. 
It was just the third time in 27 games the Lakers have lost when LeBron James and Anthony Davis brought 60+ points to the table. That’s not a great omen for the first look at this new squad.
However, there are a couple things we have to keep in mind.
First, it’s Game one of 82. Westbrook notoriously starts his seasons like he has never played basketball before.
In Washington last season, he struggled to get acclimated to his new environment until February when he began to look like an MVP candidate next to Bradley Beal. In Houston the year before, the Westbrook-Harden fit looked clunky at the start, until Westbrook got into a triple-double groove toward the latter half of the coronavirus-stricken season. 
Second, albeit how questionable they were, the rotations we saw against the Warriors won’t be Head Coach Frank Vogel’s rotations through the season. 
There is no reason for Rajon Rondo to be seeing the court — let alone next to Westbrook — clogging up driving lanes. When Kendrick Nunn, Talen Horton-Tucker and Wayne Ellington return from injury, Rondo will fall to the bottom of the guard rotation. 
Forward Carmelo Anthony does not need to see 26 minutes of game time. His shooting ability was a definite necessity, but his atrocious defensive rotations and overall lack of attentiveness cost the Lakers, and will continue to do so, especially against a ball movement-heavy team such as Golden State. 
With just under six minutes left in the game, the Lakers went on a run to pull within 2 points; it felt like the momentum in Staples Center was starting to favor the home team. Warriors sharpshooter Stephen Curry, who struggled massively all night, received a screen from teammate Draymond Green, who took Curry’s defender, Lakers guard Avery Bradley, out of the play. 
All night, the Lakers trapped Curry at the point of the screen to get the ball out of his hands. However, Green’s defender, Anthony, decided to sit near the free throw line in drop coverage, allowing Curry to step into and knock down an open top-of-the-arc three, his best look of the night. I repeat, DROP COVERAGE against the greatest shooter to ever live. 
Those kinds of mental lapses from Anthony won’t be as evident when he is playing 10-15 minutes per game, as small-ball power forward Trevor Ariza works his way back from injury. The Lakers will look a whole lot different come January or even come playoff time.
That being said, let’s overreact a little bit. 
What exactly is the Lakers plan in the half court? 
Teams will continue to pack the paint against James, Westbrook and Davis, and live with late contests on semi-open jump shots, but the Lakers need to have a plan of attack. 
Westbrook cannot be spaced one pass away, because his man will essentially leave him to provide help. He either has to be spaced to the corner or have the ball in his hands, but, when it’s crunch time, you want the ball in LeBron James’ hands, the best decision maker the league has ever seen. 
So, where does that leave former MVP Westbrook? 
The Lakers need to find continuity in their half-court offense, whether that be using Westbrook in screening actions or having him cutting off-ball, because the current hero-ball game plan is too easy to strategize against. 
But Big 3’s take time. Give Vogel and the Lakers a month or two to work out the kinks before you start spelling out doom for the season.
The bottom line is, against the Warriors, LeBron James and Anthony Davis looked fantastic and, most importantly, healthy, and coming into this season, the Lakers won 78% of the games that James and Davis played together the last two seasons.
At the end of the day, the Lakeshow still houses two basketball unicorns — I think they’ll be just fine.

USC will face No. 13 Notre Dame on the road Saturday in the 92nd rendition of the greatest intersectional rivalry in college football. Continuing a tradition stretching back to 1952, the winner of this matchup will receive the prized shillelagh, a Gaelic war club.
“Having the Shillelagh … is a big thing,” said redshirt senior tailback Vavae Malepeai after practice Tuesday. “We’re putting it on our shoulders to make sure we get that job done.”
Notre Dame leads the overall series 47-36, including the last three games played in South Bend. The Fighting Irish are not the only team with some history on their side. The Trojans are 7-5 in games after a bye week in the series and 5-1 in games when both teams had bye weeks. 
Interim Head Coach Donte Williams, who looks to rebound from USC’s first ever Coliseum loss to Utah two weeks ago, said the bye week could give the Trojans an edge Saturday.
“We had a good bye week as far as getting guys healthy and getting some guys back,” said Williams after practice Tuesday. “I think we have a good grasp of what we want to do and a slight head start on Notre Dame.”  
Among the Trojans that benefited from extra rehab time, this week is star junior linebacker Drake Jackson.
A final call has still not been made on Jackson’s status, but Williams said he is not optimistic about Jackson playing. 
If Jackson does not suit up, the Trojans could have trouble keeping up with a potent Notre Dame run game that compiled 180 yards on the ground against Virginia Tech. 
“Their tailbacks are super dynamic … if they get into the open field and they get some room they’re really hard to bring down,” said defensive coordinator Todd Orlando Wednesday at practice. 
USC struggles defending the run this season, giving up an average of more than 150 yards per game on the ground. Notre Dame’s committee approach at the quarterback position provides an additional layer of complexity for the Trojan defense. 
“They play about three [quarterbacks] every game. We have to be prepared because all those guys are different challenges,” Williams said.
On the other side of the ball for USC, junior receiver Drake London will look to continue his historic season. London’s offensive productivity this season has put him in the lead for the Biletnikoff award, with 64 receptions and 832 receiving yards in six games.
“If you look at the offensive hall, if you take Drake out of there, there’s really not enough skill guys that have much experience,” said Offensive Coordinator Graham Harrell Tuesday at practice.
London’s dominant target share is a testament to his talent but also a significant concern if the Irish can find a way to keep the ball out of his hands.
Notre Dame’s Kyle Hamilton echoed similar sentiments about London after Tuesday’s practice. 
“He’s a problem,” Hamilton said. “Our game plan is definitely centered around him. 
The Notre Dame defense is 10th in the nation at forcing turnovers, a worrisome statistic for a USC offense prone to error this season. The Fighting Irish will focus on putting pressure on junior quarterback Kedon Slovis, who has thrown five interceptions this season.
Notre Dame won their last 36 games against unranked opponents. Still, USC is no stranger to upsets, especially against Notre Dame.
In 1931, USC defeated Notre Dame who had been undefeated for more than two years. In one of the greatest comebacks in USC history, the Trojans earned their first win in South Bend. 
The eyes of the college football world will be focused on the Trojans as they look to repeat history against their biggest rival. 
Kickoff against the Irish is at 4:30 p.m. Saturday in South Bend, Ind.

USC will host Oregon State at the Galen Center for a Pac-12 conference matchup Friday. 
The Trojans currently stand with an overall record of 9-8 and conference record of 5-3, placing them seventh in the Pac-12 conference. The Beavers stand with an overall record of 3-15 and conference record of 1-7.
Just this past weekend, USC traveled eastward and delivered a statement sweep to both Arizona schools, Arizona State and University of Arizona, who are 3-2 and 3-1, respectively. With these additional victories, the Trojans now hold a three-game winning streak. 
 The Beavers currently rank second to last place in the conference standings; however, the Trojans are far from relaxed as they prepare for them.
Even though they have high hopes for continuing this streak, the team is focusing on one game at a time.
“It will always, always be about the next team,” said Head Coach Brad Keller. “It is about Oregon State. I know that’s a cliché thing to say, but at the end of the day, you start getting ahead of yourself and you start losing perspective on all that you’re trying to do. So, for a lot of us, it was about getting the proper rest, having a good mindset today and having a good game plan for Oregon State.”
 Now, as USC moves into the second half of the season, Keller made lineup changes to find the best fit for the team. Junior outside hitter Kalen Owes entered the game against Arizona State to cause a reverse sweep in favor of the Trojans.
“We have a lot of new faces, and we’re trying to figure out in one year’s time how to get to know one another,” Keller said. “That doesn’t happen overnight like people think. It takes time. So, I think we have been through a lot of different lineups which tells you that we’re open to whatever it takes to win, and this is a team effort and at the same time, we’re starting to get closer to a solidified lineup.”
To come out on top this weekend, USC needs to focus on minimizing their unforced errors. In past matches, the Trojans struggled at the service line, giving away a total of  27 points in the two matches in Arizona. 
Regardless of their standing, the Beavers will put forth all efforts to capitalize on service errors, so the Trojans plan to be diligent with limiting their errors and place more emphasis on their consistency, according to graduate student outside hitter Brooke Botkin.
“Consistency is getting more common,” Botkin said. “I feel that each game we are getting more consistent with our numbers and staying consistent all the way through to the end.”
With the end of the scheduled season on the horizon, the Trojans project what needs to happen in the coming moments.
“Honestly, it’s about winning games,” Keller said. “This team has been through a lot, but at some point, you either believe in this or you don’t, and I think this team is starting to believe and we’re starting to go in the right direction. So, it’s about gritting through tough situations and winning games.”
The Trojans will play the Beavers this Friday at the Galen Center at 7 p.m. and Oregon at 1 p.m.

Every semester, students are in a constant battle with sleep deprivation. Schoolwork, sports, clubs, family and social life require them to be continuously awake and alert. However, sleep deprivation often makes students doze off during the day. For students living off-campus, returning home and taking a nap on a busy school day is simply not a choice. Hence, the University should consider setting up nap stations on campus to provide a space for students to relax and refresh.
Although nap stations may sound new to the Trojan community, many colleges across the country already adopted them. UCLA recently set up a BruinHub with five sleeping pods for commuter students to take a short rest or even stay overnight. Sleeping pods, or napping pods, are bean-shaped pods that provide a private space for students to lay down and rest. Some sleeping pods also have music and pre-programmed nap cycles.
A New York Times article indicated that other universities, such as the University of Miami, Washington State University, Wesleyan University and Savannah College of Art and Design, all provide pods for students to take naps. At Texas A&M University, students can sign up for 30-minute or one hour naps in the sleeping pods. 
Some people may doubt whether sleeping pods can fully meet the demands of all students. The expensive cost of each sleeping pod may also pose a financial burden to the University. Luckily, sleeping pods are not the sole solution to this problem. Before the installment of napping pods, the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor’s napping station had vinyl cots and disposable pillowcases. Students received up to a 30-minute napping time when they got tired. 
Moreover, recliners or chairs with footstools in the libraries may also help students temporarily destress and clear their brains. Wake Forest University has recliners in its library. USA Today reported that UC Berkeley has “REST Zones” at five different locations on campus. These zones have lounge chairs that enable 40 students to rest and nap at a time.
It is important to address sleep deprivation among students because it may lead to a series of negative consequences. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said sleep deprivation may lead to health issues and poor mental health, which prevents students from working in their best condition. Research shows that students who sleep for six or less hours per night perform as poorly in memory and motor tasks as those who have not slept for 48 hours. In general, lack of sleep affects the normal function of the brain and makes students perform worse in academics.
Sometimes students may choose to consume coffee to overcome their sleepiness. However, this is not always helpful. In his interview with the Time Magazine, Robert Stickgold, an associate professor at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, said caffeine only boosts the consumer’s energy from 15 minutes to half an hour. On the other hand, sleep allows the brain to consolidate recent information and enables the person to recall information more efficiently. 
This research on sleep deprivation highlights the necessity for students to get enough sleep or at least take naps to make up for lack of it. Johns Hopkins Medicine pointed out that a 30 to 90 minute nap can help people have better cognition and better memory. Sleep Foundation also posits that taking naps helps improve learning and regulate emotions.
It is uneasy for students to cope with their work to balance their time between study and sleep. By setting up nap stations, the University can help alleviate the harms of sleep deprivation and promote student health and academic performance on campus.

Even the most normal-seeming people don’t show their true colors until you live with them. The friend you’re crushing on might be possessed by all the traits that make someone an intolerable roommate and you wouldn’t know it. Pig-like, mannerless, demonic, immoral — you name it, and they exist. 
The worst part about this cruel world is that exorbitant Los Angeles rent prices lead many students to inhabit the same spaces as these people, turning many homes into haunted houses — unpredictable, stress-inducing and unsanitary. 
The college lifestyle is already difficult as is, but what’s worse than living in a roach-infested apartment? Living with roaches that have a clashing personality. Better than Raid Ant & Roach Killer, Dr. Blingspice has you covered with advice to best treat all the pest problems in your apartment.
My roommate is disgusting. They haven’t done laundry once. They leave out dirty dishes for weeks and pile up trash in their corner of our room until it smells. What should I do?
L.A. is roach-infested, both literally and figuratively. People can leave the house looking clean but have their room looking like a landfill. 
You should plan an intervention with the messy roommate and set expectations for everyone. Explain the consequences of their actions — roaches, mice, bad hygiene, nasal destruction, etc. If they don’t comply with the house rules, you have the option to suffer through the unique odors and dirty laundry or flee; the latter is preferred.
In the case that you can’t leave, go to Bath & Body Works, buy a candle — or several — and light them up throughout the house. There’s nothing a Mahogany Teakwood can’t fix. If they don’t get the hint they’re radiating toxic fumes, continue pestering them to do their dishes and laundry until they get so annoyed they’re either forced to be clean or decide to live the “Ratatouille” lifestyle elsewhere.
I don’t want to live with my roommates anymore. How do I tell them?
If you’re best friends with your roommates, precede the confrontation by offering them snacks from Trader Joe’s — white truffle chips or green tea mochi typically sit well with people. Once they’re a couple bites in, express your appreciation for them or compliment their outfit — no matter how ugly it is — to alleviate any tension. The soft rice dough and a shower of flattery will soften the blow, making it so your besties aren’t offended when you tell them you’re not interested in living together. Roommate compatibility isn’t always a given, even if you’re friends; hence, no offense should be taken.
If you’re not close with your roommates, there’s no need to waste your food stamps on snacks. As soon as a conversation about housing arises, hit them with your decision. Alternatively, prepare to vanish one day with your packed bags, moving boxes and no warning. When they ask where you’re going, give them a vague response: “Home. I’m going home.”
My roommate won’t stop searching through my closet and smelling my clothes. She “accidentally” spilled coffee on my bedding and constantly makes fun of my hygiene to her friends. What should I do?
Signing a lease is like signing your soul to the devil — your landlord — and his spawns — your roommates. I recommend you flee as soon as someone starts searching through your belongings — it’s no longer repairable, no matter what exorcism is performed. 
Sage the apartment and notify your landlord about your demonic roommate. If they can’t evict them, put your lawyer hat on and get out of your lease as soon as possible. Begin looking for a new place to live; otherwise, next thing you know your roommate is pulling out the scissors to DIY your wardrobe.
If you’re unable, by any means, to escape your contract, it’ll have to be a game of who can make whose apartment life more unbearable. If your roommate wants to act like a clown, bring the whole circus. Blast awful music when you can, slam doors every time you can or spray Liquid ASS on their pillow. After a few weeks of playing them at their own game, you’ll tire out the demon. Just by blasting “Baby Shark” on your Amazon Echo while your roommate is home, you’ll cleanse your apartment of paranormal activity, strange coffee stains and entities sniffing through your closet.
If you need advice, feel free to reach out to Dr. Blingspice by direct messaging Daily Trojan on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook or by submitting your questions to the Google Form on the Instagram stories. 
Emanuel Rodriguez is a junior offering advice on students’ most pressing questions. He is also the Audience Engagement Editor at the Daily Trojan. His column, “Advice from Dr. Blingspice,” runs every other Friday.
