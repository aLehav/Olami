The No. 14 USC women’s soccer team opened its season Monday with a 4-3 win in overtime against No. 10 Brigham Young University. While the Trojans have typically played their home games at Soni McAlister field, their win against the Cougars took place in an empty Coliseum, their designated home field for the season.
The Trojans’ initial season-opener against Pepperdine was canceled due to positive coronavirus tests within the Waves’ team, forcing USC to miss out on its first scheduled game of the 2021 season. After waiting an extra few days to get started, the Trojans needed an extra 6:12 in overtime to secure a 1-0 start to their season. 
A defensive first half led to a surprising surge in attacking in the second, as the teams battled back and forth until graduate transfer forward Jennifer Westendorf’s overtime golden goal gave USC the win. 
Prior to transferring to USC, Westendorf played three seasons at Notre Dame and received All-ACC honors as a freshman and sophomore. 
The first 10 minutes of the game consisted of multiple defensive stands by both squads, with zero shots on goal by BYU. However, an offensive push in the 10th minute by the Trojans led to senior forward Tara McKeown’s first goal of the season. McKeown received a pass from sophomore midfielder Croix Bethune and navigated around BYU senior goalkeeper Cassidy Smith for the easy punch-in. 
Bethune, who missed the 2020 season due to an injury, made her first collegiate assist on the play. McKeown finished fourth in goals scored in the Pac-12 last season.
The Cougars answered in the 57th minute with a goal by sophomore forward Rachel McCarthy that leveled the game at 1-1. However, the tie did not last long. Two minutes later junior forward Penelope Hocking beat Smith in a one-on-one to put the Trojans back up a score. 
The goals continued in the 68th minute with sophomore midfielder Bella Folino scoring for the Cougars, again tying the game at 2 goals apiece. It only took two minutes for the Trojans to answer, when Hocking drew a foul in the penalty box and McKeown scored her second goal on a penalty kick. 
After 10 minutes of lockdown defensive play by both teams, Folino scored her second goal of the day, once again tying the game with just 13 minutes to play. Neither team was able to edge the other out in regulation, and it took a goal in the sixth minute of overtime by Jen Westendorf, once again assisted by Bethune, to secure a victory for USC. Westendorf’s goal was a powerful strike from outside of the box that never left the ground, weaving between two Cougar defenders.
Hocking and McKeown were one of the conference’s highest scoring duos last season, averaging a combined 1.49 goals per game last season. Hocking finished second in the Pac-12 in goals scored last season, netting 18. McKeown scored a total of 15, finishing in fourth in the conference. The duo accounted for 33 of USC’s 47 goals last season.
“I’m looking forward to them being even better,” said head coach Keidane McAlpine. “Last year was their first year to play up top together … I actually think the bond they have in their game is a little better than it was.” 
The pair are clearly continuing to ride that momentum, with 3 goals scored between the two in USC’s first game. Bethune also put on an impressive performance, recording two assists in her collegiate debut. 
McKeown, as well as Collins, were draft picks in the 2020 National Women’s Soccer League Draft. McKeown was the eighth overall pick by the Washington Spirit and Collins went in the fourth round to the Orlando Pride. However, due to a unique rule in the 2020 draft, both McKeown and Collins were able to defer for a year, and remain on the USC team. Fortunately for USC, their presence was clearly felt in Monday’s game.
The Trojans will open up conference play at Arizona State next Friday, Feb. 26. McAlpine is looking for his team to improve defensively, especially against the Sun Devils high-scoring offense. 
“I’m really hoping that we’ll just execute a little bit better over the 90 minutes, and hopefully, I can play a little bit deeper into our bench,” McAlpine said. 
The Sun Devils are 4-0 and have scored 3 or more goals in each of their games. Arizona State has also been impressive defensively with two shutouts so far this season. The game kicks off at 6 p.m. in Tempe, AZ.

The Undergraduate Student Government is intended to be the governing body of the undergraduate student population — a focal point for advocacy by connecting student voices to the USC administration for the overall improvement of the student experience.
 However, even within that definition, confusion and doubt has arisen surrounding the role of USG, leading to a fraught relationship between the organization and the student body. For USG Chief Communications Officer Shreya Chaudhary, the lack of transparency is one of the key issues that has ultimately led to distrust.
“Unfortunately, I think because of, oftentimes, the lack of transparency, amongst so many things, that’s one of the big things that has led to USG’s loss of trust with the student body,” said Chaudhary, a junior majoring in business administration.
For Alexia Sambrano, the co-executive director of the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, an ideal USG would be transparent. SAGE falls under the cultural assemblies that are under the programming department in USG’s executive branch. 
“[USG] would communicate everything to everyone in USG and to the student body,” said Sambrano, a junior majoring in neuroscience and cognitive science. “Any projects they have, any meetings they have with admin, what those meetings discuss and any changes that will be affecting the student body.” 
Currently, Sambrano said they feel like USG could do a better job at communicating updates and meetings with the student body. Considering the reckoning USG experienced last summer following the resignations of former President Truman Fritz and Vice President Rose Ritch under allegations of microaggressions and complicity, respectively, Sambrano expected USG to have a “wake up call.” 
“I think what’s been lacking has been just communication in terms of what exactly is going on to combat all of the things that they said they were going to combat over the summer,” Sambrano said. “So initiatives related to [diversity, equity and inclusion], whether it be the abolition of [Department of Public Safety] or structural changes within USC to make way for Black, Indigenous [people] and people of color to be in positions of leadership. So I would appreciate a lot more communication and transparency in terms of that.”
USG’s legislative committee posted a list of actionable items on Instagram Aug. 17 meant to address the list of demands Black students curated on @black_at_usc, faculty concerns and greater student demands. 
One of those actionable items was “publicizing upcoming meetings with administration/higher up and opening them up to the general student body (especially BIPOC) for comments and concerns.” The only meeting that has been publicized on the USG instagram following that post, however, was a USC DEI Council open meeting published Feb. 12, seven months after the initial listing.
Additionally, Sambrano also notes that within the programming branch, there’s been a lack of transparency with issues regarding budgets. On behalf of USG’s request, SAGE submitted three tentative budget proposals depending on whether the school year would be in-person, hybrid or online. When the organization was in the process of planning events for the fall semester, they found themselves without a budget until approximately halfway through September, according to Sambrano.
This presented itself as an issue when SAGE was in the process of planning Body Love Month, a program that typically takes place in the fall and focuses on body positivity and appreciation. SAGE was unable to properly plan the event given that they did not know how much money they had to work with, Sambrano said. 
“All we were told was just negotiate with talent as if you already have a budget,” Sambrano said. “But obviously, we can’t negotiate with talent if we don’t know what numbers we have to work with. And we weren’t even given a ballpark estimate of what exactly it was that we were receiving.”
By the time they received their budget, it was too late to file paperwork. Ultimately, SAGE had to move Body Love Month to the spring to avoid cancelling the program altogether because there was not a presiding officer. 
In an email to the Daily Trojan, USG Chief Financial Officer Zachariah Taymuree said that the late allocation of the Fall budget happened across all line items and that it was not particular to SAGE.
“The reason for this was simply because the USG Budget cannot be set without a CFO or Budget Committee,” Taymuree wrote. “Given that I was hired halfway through the month of September, it would not have been possible to set the budget at any point before my hiring.”
Nonetheless, Sambrano would like to see constant communication from USG. For programming and planning purposes, Sambrano would have preferred to receive early and consistent updates or at least be informed on conversations that USG has had with admin. Without this information, USG officers aren’t able to effectively do their jobs, Sambrano said. 
In terms of communication and transparency, Jaya Hinton, the co-executive director of Black Student Assembly, another cultural assembly within USG’s programming department, notes that accessibility to USG is important.
According to Hinton, USG needs to reach out to more groups, especially underrepresented communities, on campus to expand recruitment and diversify the organization, as well as become points of contact to understand student concerns.
“There are so many spaces designated for Black students, newsletters designated for those students that [USG] can put that information in to make sure they reach them, and they don’t,” said Hinton, a junior majoring in business administration. “They just use the channels that already mostly reach the same demographic that already makes up the majority of USG.”
For Hinton, a greater understanding of what USG’s powers and limitations entail is also necessary so students are able to make the most out of the organization on realistic terms and avoid frustration afterward. Hinton acknowledges that although the USG Senate can come up with “a million good goals,” what matters most is what is done upon the resolution landing on President Carol Folt’s desk.
“All a resolution really does is make a statement,” Hinton said. “[For example], this Senate wants 50,000 more dollars to distribute among our cultural assemblies to make sure that their needs are met. President Folt can throw [the resolution] away and then there’s nothing that happens after that.”
Currently, both Hinton and Sambrano do not have a clear understanding of what initiatives are being worked on within USG outside of programming, something that Hinton finds concerning on a wider scale. 
“I really have no idea what the majority of the senators are working on at any given time, or the cabinet is working at any given time,” Hinton said. “Even in USG, I have no idea what’s happening … because I know if I don’t know, nobody else could possibly know, especially a freshman who’s never stepped foot on campus — they probably have no idea what USG even means.”
According to Hinton, USG needs to be proactive and consistent when it comes to updating the student body. It is USG’s job to maintain that transparency, Hinton said. 
A potential avenue for disbursement of information takes place on the USG website. If students want to be informed about current senate legislation, they can go to USG’s website under the legislative branch — scroll all the way to the bottom — to access the senate legislation tracker for the 2020-21 school year. There is a senate database located there as well that leads students to an incomplete Google drive whose minutes for senate meetings have not been updated since Oct. 13.
Under the “resources” tab of the USG website, almost all of the information has not been updated since the 2019-20 school year. The budget is from 2019-20, as well as the senate database linked there, and even the office hours that list former USG executives Trenton Stone and Mahin Tahsin as USG president and vice president, respectively, still have not been changed.
According to Chaudhary, one of her main goals was to revamp the USG website. Fixing the website was also a general USG plan following conservations surrounding restructuring, Chaudhary said. However, due to a changing team and plans, the massive overhaul that was originally planned did not come into fruition. 
“I think it was everything that happened after restructuring that just led to everything kind of being thrown off,” Chaudhary said. “And so it’s really about trying to complete as much as we can, within this term, to set a solid foundation for the next.”
Moving forward, Speaker of the Senate Ruben Romeo said that it’s important to continue to make information digestible and accessible in order for students to take advantage of USG’s resources. 
“I think it’s highly an accessibility issue,” said Romeo, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention. “The fact that nobody knows they can write a resolution by being a student leader, the fact that people don’t know when or how senate meetings are hosted or the fact that this can actually get put into an admin’s inbox or desk for when they get that resolution passed — these are things all students should know.”
For Romeo, connecting the student body to this sort of information comes in various forms such as infographics that make senate meetings less daunting spaces, updated legislation and advocacy trackers or making legislation more accessible. While USG has spent time this year focusing on internal regroup and restructure, Romeo hopes that the next leadership will aim to address accessibility issues.  
“I hope that these attitudes of DEI, being embedded in everything, being accessible to the public, transpire to the next leadership that gets elected,” Romeo said.

The role of Undergraduate Student Government president and vice president is no small task, demanding an authentic desire and willingness to serve the USC student body with transparency, accountability and the utmost respect for the community they represent. 
Following the tumultuous onslaught of controversy in USG brought to light this past year — which led to the early resignation of former President Truman Fritz and Vice President Rose Ritch — it is all the more critical that USG’s upcoming leadership is equipped with equitable policies that lead the University forward and have character and ethical agendas that are demonstrative of the values held within our student body. For these reasons, the Daily Trojan has decided to endorse presidential candidate Shreya Chaudhary and vice presidential candidate Antonio Okeke. 
In regards to diversity, equity and inclusion, the Shreya & Antonio ticket had much to contribute, seeking to expand upon already existing propositions of diversity and inclusion, while also offering new ideas. They aim to shorten the length of the USG application to make it more accessible to students, emphasizing the importance of diversity initiatives in both staff and student pools and the necessity for establishing mandatory diversity trainings for the campus. 
When asked about Black and Palestinian students, Shreya & Antonio spoke directly about expanding physical spaces on campus for these communities. They voiced their desire to incorporate a Manasseh student group within USG. Additionally, they spoke about their support for the Black House proposition from 2015. 
The Alexis Areias and Lucy Warren ticket also supported the implementation of the Black House, similarly emphasizing their overall desire to build upon existing channels for diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Overall, the Shreya & Antonio and Alexis & Lucy tickets presented a striking contrast between their DEI initiatives and those of candidates Alexandra Gill and Dell Wood. When asked about addressing such issues on campus, Gill and Wood mentioned their desire to support Greek life organizations and their ongoing DEI efforts, stating they would also like to help them with socioeconomic diversity by “giving them some money to ease the barrier to entry financially.” 
Regarding security and the Department of Public Safety, the platforms hold starkly contrasting agendas. The Alexandra & Dell ticket posits DPS as a “very misunderstood organization” and opposes defunding it because “that is not practical while living in South Central L.A.” Instead, they propose that students should be allowed to shadow DPS to establish transparency and uphold accountability within the organization. The Alexandra & Dell ticket also proposes that students should be able to possess non-lethal weapons such as tasers on campus. 
The Daily Trojan acknowledges the discrimination experienced by Black and Indigenous students and students of color and community members that necessitates an anti-racist approach to public safety. Because we believe that the Alexandra & Dell platform supports policies that could potentially threaten the USC and South Central community, where Black and Latinx students and other community members experience racial profiling and violence at the hands of DPS, we instead support the public safety agendas of the Shreya & Antonio and Alexis & Lucy tickets, which call for providing DPS with the training to become better allies to the community and radical change within the organization, respectively. 
There is a clear need at USC to improve resources for international students and help them adapt to student life in the United States — especially during the coronavirus pandemic. All three tickets are adamant about bolstering funding for the Office of International Services and expanding the office, but the Shreya & Antonio ticket is the only one with a solid, tangible action plan that can serve international students from day one. 
Their platform includes a roadmap to make USC easier to navigate for the University’s large number of international students. Integral to their plan is developing an international student peer mentorship program which will help acclimate international students to USC. Additionally, the candidates’ plan to partner with the University’s Office of International Services in order to grow this program and provide official training for mentors.
Shreya & Antonio are also passionate about helping students avoid a situation in which they would have to choose between their mental health and their education. While all three tickets recognized the need to improve and expand on mental health resources at USC, Shreya & Antonio set themselves apart from the other candidates through concrete steps. 
Specifically, their ticket proposes reinstating doctor’s notes from Engemenn health professionals, allowing students to take time to prioritize their physical and mental health without being penalized for it academically. In addition, they aim to expand and diversify the counseling services and staff at Engemann — in alignment with their platform-wide goals to ensure diversity, equity and inclusion.
Shreya & Antonio also propose an extension of Engemann’s hours of operation during testing seasons, mentioning that mental health is not only an issue for students in the specific time block during which Engemann offers counseling services. In an interview with the Daily Trojan Editorial Board, Okeke also mentioned their hopes to work with Engemann and their financial managers, to ensure students have access to their services 24/7. 
Their platform also addresses the need to expand mental health services to students who are currently living outside of California. Shreya & Antonio plan to take a look at policies that prevent USC from serving out-of-state students. Alexandra & Dell also emphasized the need for accessibility to mental health resources.
On the issue of campus and community sustainability, the Areias and Warren and Chaudhary and Okeke platforms contributed substantive action plans to create change within current University practices. In support of DivestSC, both tickets called for the selling of University investments in the fossil fuel industry, totaling to a staggering $277 million. Both tickets also endorsed the ban of single-use plastics campus-wide, and shared a commitment to creating a commuter program to reduce student carbon emissions. 
In looking at current campus sustainability measures, the Chaudhary & Okeke ticket acknowledges the benefits of the University’s long term sustainability plan, but aims to create more policies that are responsive to campus pollution happening now. This includes the implementation of a carbon emissions offset program, taking into account University-sponsored travel and creating a program to invest an amount equivalent into community sustainability efforts. 
In speaking of their plans to work closely with the Garden Club, Chaudhary and Okeke emphasized their commitment to mobilizing USC and its surrounding community to create more green spaces around campus, aiming to reach better practices in sustainability in the coming year and beyond. 
Ultimately, unanticipated issues are bound to face whoever wins the election. The inevitability of the unpredictable is why trust in the judgment and character of whoever is elected is of the utmost importance. In this regard, the Chaudhary and Okeke duo offer what feels like true sincerity and humility, according to their virtual endorsement video with the editorial board. 
They understand their role as one to serve the community they are in, which was made clear by Chaudhary’s introduction of their ticket in the Feb. 4 virtual debate. Chaudhary began by offering a month by month breakdown of her and Okeke’s action plan. By contrast, Gill introduced their ticket with an emphasis on her and her running mate’s status as “outsiders,” demanding an end to career politicians. 
Moreover, throughout the course of the debate, some unbecoming personal attacks were levied, however Chaudhary and Okeke positioned themselves the least of the frivolous crossfire. Meanwhile, candidates Gill and Areias went back and forth about the extent of their personal involvement in Greek life, among other things. Chaudhary and Okeke’s behavior over the course of the undoubtedly tumultuous and sometimes-derailed debate showcases their focus and genuine commitment to issues of substance. 
On a final note, over the course of the endorsement interviews conducted by the Daily Trojan with all candidates, Chaudhary and Okeke offered by far the most straightforward answers to our questions. While platitudes and rhetorical fluff are always to be expected in politics, they were notably absent from the duo’s responses. For lack of a better term, they stuck to the real stuff. 
While the Daily Trojan has officially made their endorsement for the Chaudhary & Okeke ticket, it remains clear that the endorsement is not made in perpetuity. Our endorsement is reliant upon candidate interviews and an analysis of their public platforms and debates, which in no part serve to represent the actions, decisions and behaviors of candidates if they are to assume office. The Daily Trojan pledges to continue holding University leaders accountable for the problems and shortcomings they seek to tackle and the ones they may create themselves. 
While we have defended our endorsement with research and assessment of what we believe to be the best fit for student leadership, we call upon the student body to conduct their own research, and to critically engage and question the candidates on their platforms as well. Undergraduate student leaders are elected to represent the interests, values and needs of students, in which they can only be held accountable through the votes and participation of students in the election process. We are grateful to student activists who have demonstrated the importance of calling out our elected leaders when they have failed to uphold the interests of our community, and encourage all students to thoughtfully take inspiration from their work as we elect USC’s next cohort of undergraduate student leaders.
