I’m a straight man and the #MeToo movement has made me self-conscious. I want to support women, help them feel safe and make sure I’m being respectful. What are some ways I can do this?
Well, first of all, you’re doing right by asking a woman for her take. If there’s one thing we don’t need, it’s men explaining and litigating #MeToo among themselves without any insight from women. 
And thank you for being honest about your self-consciousness. We’re coming up on the anniversary of the movement, and let’s be real: There have been far too many media takes about how uncomfortable men are with the movement, which has forced them to — *gasp* — evaluate how their words and actions may make women feel. But your self-consciousness is the good kind. You’ve become more self-aware and want to do better by the women in your life, and that’s awesome.
For starters, #MeToo shouldn’t center around and prioritize the male experience and male fears and insecurities. We should care about and pay attention to how the movement has helped change women and survivors’ lives for the better, despite how, of course, there’s still much progress to be made.
Anyway, to answer your question, let’s start with some very, very low-hanging fruit. First, no matter what you think you know and no matter your relationship status, you should absolutely review the fundamentals of consent. For example, drunk people can’t consent; consent is a case-by-case, one-time exchange; and consent must be freely given without coercion and exploitation of power dynamics, or it isn’t consent at all. Far too many sexual assaults or other encounters that harm or cause women to feel unsafe are the product of dangerous ignorance about consent. You can do your part to help women feel safe just by making sure you understand consent.
You can also try to make affirmative consent language a part of your sexual encounters. Ask your partner(s) what they want, what feels good and certainly be respectful of their comfort and experience.
Of course, #MeToo encompasses more than rape culture. It also explores related issues of gendered power dynamics and exploitation, and generally speaking, the disregard for and erasure of women’s experiences. From crass, sexist jokes male co-workers may make in the office to any day-to-day language that could be demeaning or upsetting to women in your life, start to think generally about how your behavior could make those around you feel. 
That said, reach out to the women you feel close to and open up honest dialogues with them. Tell them you’re there to listen to their experiences and want to support them in any way they need. Ask them about any comments you’ve made, or anything you’ve done that’s made them uncomfortable before. If they’ve taken issue with anything, promise them it won’t happen again and to be more cognizant going forward.
When it comes to #MeToo, it’s important to realize the behaviors that we’re finally starting to take seriously and hold perpetrators accountable for have always been wrong. If you know you’ve been a part of this culture, recognize that there’s no good excuse. Take responsibility. And going forward, take real steps to listen to women, respect women, and adapt your behavior.

Abigail Menendez is an undergraduate student planning to study environmental engineering who served in the Navy. (Kevin Fohrer | Daily Trojan)
After graduating from the University of Minnesota in 2010, Katie Aleckson was at a loss. 
The economy was still recovering from the recession and it was difficult to find work. She decided to enlist in the Navy — a path that led her to the Master of Public Health program at USC, where she is scheduled to graduate in December.
While some veterans like Aleckson have faced difficulties during their time in the armed forces, they are now finding a community at USC. And though the services provided can be limited — especially for active duty members — the University is developing programs to better serve student veterans.
“We know the value of people who have served in the military is really strong because … less than 1 percent of the population serves, so they have a unique perspective on the many things that they’ve worked on,” said Shahla Fatemi, who manages USC’s Military & Veteran Initiatives. “They’re bringing a huge value to USC and it’s also influencing the other students, staff and faculty.”
A challenge for women
Abigail Menendez, 24, left home for the first time when she was 17 to attend boot camp in Chicago. In July, she ended her service in the Navy, after being stationed overseas as well as California and Georgia. 
“I like to challenge myself, so that really drove me,” Menendez said. “There were really tough times, but I really value those times because I grew as a person because of them.” 
Although Menendez couldn’t speak extensively about her duty, she described her co-service members as mostly male. She worked her way to serve as a supervisor, but said many men looked at her with doubt or hostility, an experience she said many women in the armed forces shared.  
An older male supervisor wouldn’t listen to anything she said, telling her, “I’m not afraid to embarrass you in front of everybody,” she said. A close male friend once told Menendez that she had only received her position because she was a “pretty girl.” 
“It caused self-doubt even though I knew that I earned those,” Menendez said. “It’s very like a boys’ club, so those things do happen, but I’m glad I got stronger because of that and know how to address them in the future.” 
Last summer, Menendez decided she wanted to earn her bachelor’s degree after not being in school for six years, despite re-enlisting in the Navy. She plans to study environmental engineering to help fight climate change and hopes to get into politics using her military background.
“I think it’s important [to know] that all veterans have something that they could teach people,” Menendez said.

Aleckson started in the Master of Public Health program, focusing on environmental health, after finishing her service in May 2017. She said that although USC does a good job recognizing veterans and providing services, she feels there is more emphasis placed on men, who are more visible as members of the Veterans Association and more represented in the Veterans Resource Center. 
Only 14.5 percent of active duty service members are women. But Fatemi said that because of this perception, USC makes an effort to encourage female veterans to attend events and has multiple female members of the Veterans Resource Center board.
“Nothing that we do in the Veterans Resource Center is male-specific,” Fatemi said. “It’s open to all females, all people, all gender orientations and all sexual orientations.”
Aleckson said that she didn’t experience any discrimination as a woman in the military, but recognized that not all women had similarly tolerable experiences. She said she hopes to see more female veterans at events and further support each other on campus. 
“We need to stop being ‘male or female,’ but [focus on] who people are as a person,” Aleckson said. 
Service and study
Raquel Orozco, 35, is a Masters of Social Work student and an active duty military police member stationed in Fort Bragg. She has been in the military for a little over 18 years, and was accepted into USC in May this year. 
According to Orozco, a lot of resources at the University are catered toward non-active duty veterans, which makes receiving help very difficult.
Free seminars and Continuing Education Units are only offered to personnel in the USC vicinity, making it difficult for active duty students to physically attend. Orozco said she wants USC to create an online service so out-of-state students can use the benefit provided for graduate students.
Fatemi added that the Veterans Resource Center is working on expanding its reach by talking to students like Orozco.
“We’re testing things out and we’re trying to develop programs, so a lot of it is just gathering information from the students themselves,” Fatemi said.
Fatemi said the Resource Center has been looking into establishing virtual hours for active duty members to give them the opportunity to Skype with the program coordinator. 
After retiring, Orozco wants to work with veterans in combat through social work, and aims to use her background in the military to help them with the remainder of their lives. She plans to seek new treatments for combat veterans affected by isolation, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and survivor’s guilt — issues that some veterans at USC may struggle with. Ultimately, Orozco said she hopes students will recognize what their peers with military backgrounds may be going through. 
“What inspired me to work with combat veterans is that for 18 years, I have been able to see how slow or limited mental health and assistance in managing isolation due to combat experience is,” Orozco said. “We don’t just think about going to war every day.”

Laura Faer, regional director of the San Francisco Office for Civil Rights, gave a presentation about how the OCR has been finding facts relevant to its investigation of USC. (Gabi Thur De Koos | Daily Trojan)
The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights visited USC Wednesday to discuss the University’s response to complaints about former health center gynecologist George Tyndall. Following a one-hour community meeting, OCR reserved two hours for private discussions with students regarding the sexual assault allegations. 
Over 300 women have come forward with sexual assault allegations against Tyndall during his tenure at USC, since revelations of his alleged misconduct were first made public in May. Tyndall was a gynecologist at USC for nearly 30 years.
The OCR is investigating USC’s compliance with Title IX, which prohibits educational institutions from discriminating on the basis of sex, including sexual harassment. 
Laura Faer, the regional director of the OCR office in San Francisco, started the meeting by speaking about OCR’s role in the investigative process. The investigation began on May 24, and concerns whether USC failed to respond promptly and equitably to notice of the harassment, and if they allowed any student to be subjected to a sexually hostile environment after being notified of the harassment.
“We do not represent the complainant, and we do not represent the institutions who have alleged to have been engaging in discrimination,” Faer said. “During the investigation, as I discussed before, OCR is a neutral fact-finder.”
Following Faer’s short presentation, three people testified publicly to nearly 30 people and the media. 
Mark Malan, a member of the staff assembly and an accountant in the Provost’s office, spoke on his experience with the “culture of silence” at USC. 
“I’m here to admit my guilt for not speaking out publicly on matters like this,” Malan said. “As staff at USC, we all know someone who knows something, who should step forward and speak, but we also know that they don’t. Because anyone who does, gets fired.” 
Malan argued that the University should abolish the arbitration agreement it forces employees to sign, which prevents staff members from suing USC. 
Malan said he believes USC equates legal actions with ethical behavior, which allows the University to discriminate systemically. 
“So I hope that part of OCR’s recommendation, to free the staff from the bonds that we are in, will be that the University needs to eliminate the arbitration agreement immediately,” Malan said. “Because otherwise, all of this is just going to happen again.” 
Dana Loewy spoke about her experience with Tyndall in the early 90s. She thanked OCR for conducting the investigation, and said she hoped there was more time being dedicated to this investigation than just the three-hour period reserved. 
“This is nothing short of scandalous,” Loewy said. “USC is guilty of maintaining a culture of silence and secrecy.” 
Loewy believes Provost Michael Quick and president emeritus C. L. Max Nikias should both step down from the University. 
Alumna Annette Richardson said that when she entered the University in the Fall of 2000, she needed a referral from Tyndall for an off-campus gynecologist. She called the encounter “the most uncomfortable exam” she had ever had. 
“At the time I was young, I didn’t know what else to do other than just go along with the visit,” Richardson said. “It felt like I was being molested by an unwanted sexual predator.” 
Richardson said she was extremely uncomfortable, in pain, and felt humiliated during the exam. After the appointment, she told the nurse what had happened. 
“She said, ‘That’s just how Dr. Tyndall is,’” Richardson said. “I’ve met women that have had horrible things happen since my visit, and it could have been prevented.”
Following the testimony, the OCR began its two-hour session of 15-minute meetings with those who had signed up to speak to them. The investigation is ongoing. 
“The reason that I’m here is I want to stand up for anyone that has been abused through this system,” Richardson said. “We need to make changes so this doesn’t happen to anyone in the future.”

Phi Sigma Kappa Fraternity will not be able to host Trojan Family Weekend or hold fundraisers while under suspension. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity released a statement Wednesday announcing that it may sue the University after it was suspended Friday for alleged hazing violations. The fraternity said USC has not informed them of any specific event related to hazing.
“Unfortunately, the University’s standard operating procedure has been to ‘suspend first, provide information later,’” the statement read. “We believe that procedure runs counter to the law, due process and fundamental fairness not only to us, but to our larger community.”
According to the statement, the fraternity contacted University officials and Greek life liaison offices and hired an attorney who sent a letter to the University requesting information.
The University declined to comment about the statement.
The alleged hazing violation was written with a notice of interim suspension on the Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development website. The Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity was also suspended Friday for the same alleged violation.
“We wish to be clear: We do not condone hazing, in any form, and believe it should be eradicated from Greek life,” the Phi Sigma Kappa statement read. “That said, we have spoken to our brothers and new members, and we are unaware of any ‘hazing’ incidents, complaints or other issues involving Phi Sigma Kappa, which makes the University’s action, and the speculation around its reasons, all the more frustrating.”
Phi Sigma Kappa President Bradley Billig said the issue was about the larger student body  rather than the fraternity. 
“This situation isn’t about us so much as it’s about the basic rights of all students and organizations to be treated with fairness and transparency,” he said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “The University has not made us aware of any improper conduct, but if there is, we simply would like to know what it is so we can promptly address and correct it in full cooperation with the University and regain our good standing in the community.”
In a general statement to the Daily Trojan Monday, USC said it takes hazing violations seriously.
“Organizations that are being investigated for alleged violations of the code of conduct can be instructed to suspend or modify social activities pending results of an investigation,” the University wrote.
The interim suspension will impede on the fraternity’s ability to fundraise and host events for Trojan Family Weekend. Phi Sigma Kappa believes the suspension will hurt the organization.
“We have a proud tradition and track-record of positive community involvement at Phi Sigma Kappa and, in our view, our future of community engagement, as well as personal, academic and professional development has never been brighter,” the statement read.

Redshirt sophomore running back Vavae Malepeai is on track to surpass his 2017 season rushing yard total. (Tucker Judkins | Daily Trojan)
USC took the practice field Wednesday ahead of Saturday’s matchup with No. 19 Colorado with two Buffaloes in mind: junior quarterback Steven Montez and sophomore wide receiver Laviska Shenault Jr.
Montez is a model of efficiency, as proven by his 11:2 touchdown to interception ratio this season. He has completed 75.2 percent of his passes, good for second in the nation despite attempting more passes than anyone else in the top five. The third-year starter doesn’t only rely on short passes either; his 9.3 yards per attempt ranks 14th in the FBS.
“Now he’s been in the system for a little bit, you can really see his maturity within the offense,” defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said. “He can make all the throws, and he makes a lot of plays with his feet as well.”
Unlike Montez, Shenault came into 2018 as a relatively unknown player, but he’s made a name for himself early this season. He ranks third in the country in both receptions and yards — 51 and 708, respectively — and has added six receiving touchdowns. 
Shenault is a multifaceted threat, reflected in his four rushing touchdowns in just five games. His 749 total yards from scrimmage rank 11th in the nation, partially a result of a creative Colorado offense.
“They line him up in a lot of different spots, they do a really nice job of covering him up,” Pendergast said. “I think the most impressive thing offensively that they do is multiplicity within their formations, and he’s a big part of that.”
Coming off a 13-reception, 127-yard performance against Arizona State that featured four total touchdowns and earned him Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week, the Trojans will be hard-pressed to limit Shenault.
Part of the Buffaloes’ offensive creativity comes from their use of trick plays and wildcat formations. Trick plays have burned the Trojans at times this year, most notably on a 71-yard touchdown run from UNLV during Week 1.
“We just have to play with good eye discipline and control, and play them when they come,” Pendergast said. “They’ve got a really good package of trick plays, and they use multiple people in [them].”
Although the calls may seem like a gimmick, players have full confidence in their coaches’ play-calling.
“It’s a lot of eye candy no doubt, but coach [Pendergast] just says ‘keep your eyes on your luggage,’” freshman safety Talanoa Hufanga said. “We need to see where our guy goes, and make sure that we follow up. When the ball crosses the line of scrimmage, that’s when we know we have to attack.” 
Wednesday’s practice featured an emphasis on third down, which Helton said would be crucial against a talented offense like Colorado’s, especially with Montez’s ability to create outside the pocket at 6-foot-5 and 235 pounds.
“You look at what he’s doing right now, escaping and creating, and not only running the ball and pulling it down, but actually finding his receivers,” Helton said. “We’re going to need to contain him and get off the field.”
That also applied to the other side of the ball; Helton said that Colorado brings a variety of pressures on third down, and that protecting freshman quarterback JT Daniels could be a deciding factor.
After a sloppy start to the season, the Trojans are looking to prove themselves in a matchup with a ranked team under the Coliseum lights.
“We’re trying to get back to that Pac-12 Championship [game],” redshirt senior cornerback Ajene Harris said. “Every game is important, and we’re all aware of that. We’re just ready to compete.”
Injury update
Sophomore running back Stephen Carr did not attend practice due to a stomach illness. The staff held out redshirt senior center Toa Lobendahn with back spasms. Senior linebacker Porter Gustin is expected to be at full strength Saturday after recovering from an ankle injury.
Senior linebacker Cam Smith left practice early with a tight hamstring. Helton said it was nothing serious, just a preventative measure. The staff also pulled Brandon Pili after the sophomore defensive lineman had his toe stepped on. Helton said they would get an X-ray as a precaution.

The women’s tennis team is already in midseason shape. Even though the team does not start conference play until the spring, the Women of Troy have played in two Intercollegiate Tennis Association tournaments and the Battle in the Bay tournament in San Francisco.
The Trojans are now preparing for the Women of Troy Fall Invitational, which will take place Friday through Sunday at Marks Stadium. This will be their first time hosting, and the team will play Oregon, Cal State Fullerton and Loyola Marymount University. 
“It’s been a while since we played a home match, so it will be fun,” senior Rianna Valdes said.  
This tournament will be the first chance for new players to showcase their talent. The team has already proven its dominance, however, winning both singles and doubles championships from the Battle in the Bay tournament. Freshman Danielle Willson won the singles championship, beating her own teammate, sophomore Ana Neffa, in the championship match 3-6, 6-4, 6-4. The former All-American will face some fierce competition this weekend.
Aside from the Battle of the Bay tournament,  freshman Salma Ewing had a solid performance at the ITA Oracle Masters event in Malibu. Ranked  No. 5 freshman in the nation, Ewing reached the quarterfinal in this loaded tournament field, but lost to Michigan’s Kate Fahey 6-7(1), 6-2, 7-6(3). The 18-year-old was the No. 1 recruit out of high school. 
“I’m looking to improve my serve and my overall movement on court, Ewing said. “Definitely moving forward, I want to incorporate that to my game.” 
The team has only one returning senior in Valdes, who looks to add onto her tremendous career. Currently ranked No. 74 in the nation, Valdes went 14-7 in singles and 12-10 in doubles. 
This weekend, Valdes will play with junior Angela Kulikov after their spectacular performance during the ITA All-American Championships in Pacific Palisades last week. Valdes and Kulikov made it to the quarterfinals, before losing to a 14th-ranked doubles team from Wichita State, featuring junior Fatima Bizhukova and junior Marta Bellucco, by a score of 8-4. Despite the loss, Valdes and Kulikov opened eyes as they beat five nationally ranked teams en route to the quarterfinal. 
“I think we found a lot of things that worked for us, different plays, so just take it back to practice, work on it and get better,” Valdes said.
Kulikov looks to have a great tournament, as well as another fantastic season. The junior from of Sun Valley, Calif. looks to build on a spectacular sophomore campaign, where she played number one doubles with Valdes the majority of the season. Head coach Alison Swain may also look to Kulikov to fill the vacant singles spot left by Gabby Smith this season.
Neffa and junior Constance Branstine are also eyeing another doubles championship this weekend. The pair displayed just how dangerous they can be when they won the doubles championship at the Battle of the Bay tournament. Neffa, a sophomore transfer from St. Thomas University, looks to restart her career after not playing during her freshman season. While Branstine begins her second season in a Trojan uniform; the former five-star blue chip recruit had a strong sophomore season, finishing 12-12 in singles and 11-11 in doubles. 
This season’s team certainly gives Swain high hopes in her second season as the team’s head coach. After finishing eighth in the Pac-12 last year, the Women of Troy have a chip on their shoulder.

Senior libero Victoria Garrick has tallied 300 kills in the 2018 season. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
After splitting games last weekend at home, the No. 15 women’s volleyball team is looking to take full advantage of home court this weekend as it faces No. 25 ASU on Friday and No. 23 Arizona on Sunday .
“We had  a weird game against Oregon,” head coach Brent Crouch said. “We weren’t slowing them down when they were in system offense, especially their middles. That’s been a theme for us in all our losses, so we want to take a step forward with that this weekend. Win or lose, we want to be shutting people down.”
The game against ASU offers another factor for the team to consider, as one of the ASU players is already very familiar with what it is like to play on the Galen Center court. Senior outside hitter Alyse Ford started her collegiate volleyball career at USC before transferring for her final season to play for the Sun Devils. At ASU she is currently averaging 3.02 kills per set. In her last season at USC, Ford ended with an average of 2.56 kills.
 “Ford and I were in the same freshman class, so I was her teammate, I lived with her, roomed with her and I played with her for three years,”said senior libero Victoria Garrick. “It’ll be weird seeing her in a different jersey, but I’m happy she’s happy and thriving on that team. I’m just excited to play her because I played against her in practice for three years.”
On the defensive front, the Women of Troy average 1.9 to 2 blocks per set and have only totaled 12 to their opponents 30 solo blocks. USC also averages the same number of digs as its opponents with 15.7 per set. 
The Trojans plan to improve their defense this weekend. 
“You’ve gotta get good at the things you do,” Crouch said. “[Tuesday] we were just reviewing our defense. We need to get better at our identity in our defense, so we’ve mostly been on that this week.”
Along with Ford, the Sun Devils’ junior outside hitter Ivana Jeremic is leading her team with an average of 3.67 kills per set. At Arizona, senior outside hitter Kendra Dahlke leads her team with an average of 5.17 kills per set. It will be up to the blockers and Garrick to hold down USC’s defense. 
“Both of the Arizonas have been doing really well this season, which hasn’t been the case previously,” Garrick said. “It’ll be challenging to play these new teams that the Arizona’s have built.”
The team is led by sophomore and junior outside hitters Brooke Botkin and Khalia Lanier, who are averaging 4.35 and 4.30 kills per set respectively.
Freshmen setter Raquel Lázaro has also been consistent with an average of 11.25 assists per set. Spending their practices on strengthening their defense and their offense with Botkin, Lanier and Lázaro, the Trojans are looking to prove they can do it all this weekend.
USC will host ASU at 7 p.m. Friday and Arizona at 1 p.m. Sunday.

Every time a former football star dies, I ask the same question — when is enough going to be enough?
Yesterday, the Daily Trojan reported on the death of Kevin Ellison, a former captain of the USC football team. Ellison died after years of struggling with mental illness, mainly bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, which his family believes in part was caused by traumatic brain injuries suffered playing football. 
Ellison’s brain will soon join those of the hundreds of fellow deceased football stars at the Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Center at Boston University, where Dr. Ann McKee has been feverishly researching CTE for years. When his brain finally lays to rest there, Ellison will become one of the many recent victims of the deadly risks of playing football, the most popular sport in America.
I want to know how many more deaths it’s going to take. I thought, maybe, that the decline and death of Junior Seau would be enough. But it wasn’t, despite the ESPN “30 for 30” and the countless memorial ceremonies. So I thought, okay, maybe it’ll take a kid, or a quarterback, to make this point. Then came Tyler Hilinski’s tragic death a year ago, and the same grief and mourning subsided and gave way to inaction. Maybe, then, it would take a player suffering a grave injury on the field — but no, Ryan Shazier was paralyzed from the waist down on national television, and the football world spun on.
The ugly thing about football is that it’s violent. We like it, most likely, because of this factor, for the same reason that we like watching war movies and playing shoot-’em-up video games. There’s something in our DNA that loves seeing someone get completely pummelled.
I get that. I love football for its physicality, and yes, for its violence. Most football fans are slow to admit it, especially now, but there’s a reason we all let out the same excitable “oooh” when senior linebacker Porter Gustin absolutely drills an opposing quarterback. Somewhere, deep down, violence is what makes football as popular as it is.
That is, after all, why it’s so hard to let go of it all. If football fans collectively, truly disliked the violence, we could cut it out in a second. We could turn the game into touch or flag, strip it down to a game of speed, not strength. If the violence was truly universally abhorrent, we could eliminate it so quickly that we’d wonder why it was a problem in the first place.
But we don’t. In football, we live for the hits, for the tackles, the sacks. Even offensive players love to lay out a good hit (just ask USC’s former star wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, who makes highlights with his bone-crunching blocks in the open field). We still love this violence, even when we know the pain it’s inducing, even when we know it’s killing the athletes we claim to revere.
I want to know when the turning point will come. I ask myself this question every week. Since coming to USC, I’ve studied CTE for journalism assignments and class projects on-and-off for four years. I know the risks. I know that many concussions come from contact to the body — not just to the head — meaning that no helmet can ever prevent CTE. I know that many athletes begin to forget details in their 30s and 40s, that they die decades earlier than  non-athletes, that many of their final years are spent living in a murky, painful swamp of splitting headaches and unending pain.
And yet, every Saturday, I’m at the Coliseum, in the press box or in the stands. On Sunday, I’m on my couch with breakfast at 10 a.m., tuned into NFL Red Zone, tracking Patrick Mahomes’ statistics. I want to see Gustin and senior linebacker Cam Smith rope up quarterbacks. I want the Chiefs’ defensive line to be the hardest hitting in the NFL. I know what happens with every snap, and I’m painfully aware of what I’m condoning and encouraging every week when I turn on the TV. And yet, I can’t stop.
So I ask this of myself, as much as anyone else. What is it going to take? Who has to die? Will it take a famous quarterback? Will it have to happen on the field? In the Super Bowl? Or will we just keep on moving, keep on watching, content to condemn these players to their deaths because we don’t want to give up our Sunday watch parties? 
I don’t have any of the answers. I know that my children will never touch a football, and maybe this is what it will take — a generation of reformed fans putting their foot down when it comes to their own children. But I do know that a change has to come.
A new football season is rolling on, and we’re adding to the body count with every passing Sunday. Someday, somehow, something has to give.

Simran Jehani, a senior majoring in communication started filming “The Skimmer” on Oct. 5 to give others a glimpse into Zoroastrianism, a religion practiced by over 250,000 people in the world today. (Emmeline Salazar | Daily Trojan)
When Simran Jehani first came to USC, people asked her a question she was all too familiar with — “what are you?”  
Telling them she was Zoroastrian caused some confusion — so Jehani, a senior majoring in communication, realized she needed to do something to increase representation of her religious background in popular media. 
That’s how Jehani came up with the idea for her short film, “The Skimmer,” about a Zoroastrian girl who navigates high school and tries to figure out her identity after her mom’s divorce. Jehani was born and raised in India, and said her culture is in many ways patriarchal. As a result, her film explores the lives of the two women independent of male influences. 
“I have watched so many movies that I haven’t seen people like me in,” Jehani said. “I haven’t seen people who look like me. I haven’t seen movies with storylines that I have experienced.”
Filming, which began on Oct. 5, took place in in five different locations in Los Angeles, including the Saban Center and a salon owned by a Persian woman. The project is scheduled for release in early January.
As one of 250,000 people in the world who practice Zoroastrianism, one of the world’s oldest monotheistic religions, Jehani believes it is her responsibility to share her culture with the wider public. The prophet Zoroaster founded Zoroastrianism 3,500 years ago in modern-day Iran, and the religion today centers around the cosmic and moral dualism of good and evil. 
“This is how we have been taught to live our lives and how we are trying to figure out our own place in this world,” Jehani said. 
Through “The Skimmer,” Jehani also aims to showcase the similarities between her culture and others that may be more familiar to American audiences. In particular, she wanted to challenge popular conceptions about women of color — especially those with religious or cultural backgrounds — to showcase the diversity of women’s experiences.
“I am very into ‘slice of life’ [stories] and like to show how people are and how they exist,” Jehani said. “I’m hoping we can normalize how women of color are portrayed on screen as mothers and daughters and not as [stereotypes.] We want to show that they exist and they exist in normal ways too.”
One of her goals for the film was to represent people of color, both in front of and behind the camera. According to the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative’s study of 1,100 popular films, females represented only 31.8 percent of all speaking roles and non-white actors represented less than 30 percent. 
Most of the cast and crew of “The Skimmer” comprises women and people of color (including the lead actors as well as Jehani herself). However, bringing the group together was not easy. Jehani and her producers — USC alumnus Hampus Wahlin, sophomore Aslan Dalgic and senior Ilana Spiegel — have been working on the project for four months and are still finalizing its crew members.
“There has not been a lot of opportunity to create stories and narratives like this,” Wahlin said. “Therefore, not many people seek out the opportunity to be a part of it because they don’t think they will be there.” 
By reaching out to friends and encouraging them to spread the word, Jehani and Wahlin were able to cast everyone they needed for the film. Wahlin said that although the process was difficult, the final product will be worthwhile.
“It is not just emotionally strong, like a good story, but it also just feels like it is something that has to be told,” Wahlin said.
Jehani and Wahlin also plan on submitting “The Skimmer” to film festivals, focusing on smaller venues that will allow them to target more specialized audiences. Jehani also plans to participate in film festivals in India, where she hopes to encourage those who relate to the film to join the entertainment and film industry. 
“The interesting, fun thing about short films is finding a audience,” Wahlin said. “When you have a final product, it’s really you seeking out people who will really push this film forward [and] make sure that the movie gets out there.”

“Kidding,” starring comedic actor Jim Carrey, premiered on Aug. 31. The show was renewed for a second season Wednesday. (Courtesy of IMDb)
At first glance, Showtime series “Kidding” serves as a comeback role for Jim Carrey, who’s starred in critically-panned and forgotten projects in recent years.
The show also marks Carrey’s second collaboration with Michel Gondry, who directed three episodes and serves as the show’s executive producer. Gondry’s involvement with “Kidding” speaks to its potential — his first collaboration with Carrey resulted in “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.” At the first season’s midpoint, however, it’s clear that it won’t recapture the magic of that film, despite being renewed for a second season Wednesday.
For 30 years, Jeff Piccirillo (Carrey) has played Mr. Pickles in the acclaimed PBS children’s program “Mr. Pickles’ Puppet Time.” However, when his son Phil dies in a truck accident, he starts to have trouble coping with reality. His ex-wife Jill (Judy Greer) leaves him, and he finds difficulty connecting with his son Will (Cole Allen). As a result of the trauma, his perception of these changes is warped and he views life as a sanitized version of a children’s show.
Mixing a “Mr. Rogers”-esque tone with heavy moral quandaries, “Kidding” raises questions about the staged nature of children’s shows and their tendencies to avoid dealing with pressures of reality. For example, in the show’s pilot, “Green Means Go,” Mr. Pickles talks about Phil’s death to a live audience of children by comparing it to accidentally putting your favorite stuffed animal in a donation box when moving to a new town. Much of the dialogue and themes are driven by a mix of tragedy and irony.
Piccirillo’s desire to teach children about mature topics are more than a projection of his distorted reality; his decisions for the show’s direction provoke discussions about the creative conflict between artistically-focused individuals and money-driven producers, a constant problem in Hollywood. 
Piccirillo’s father, Sebastian (Frank Langella), is opposed to his son’s creative decisions, as he becomes more intent on franchising his son’s creation with “Pickles on Ice” and an animated rendition of the show. Even when it seems like Piccarillo is putting the show back on track in the fifth, “The New You,” with a song about clouds, Sebastian still requests the scene be reshot because Piccarillo was not wearing his wedding ring.
“We are losing control of him,” Sebastian tells his daughter and head puppet maker Deirdre (Catherine Keener). “We need versions of him we can control.” 
Outside of these introspective themes, “Kidding” is also filled with incredible technical elements. Both the set and production design of “Mr. Pickles’ Puppet Time” are brimming with creativity — combining props, visual effects and variance in design and operation of the puppets. 
However, the highlight of the season thus far is when a character named Shaina (Riki Lindhome) remodels her house in “Every Pain Needs a Name.” Despite showing her performing many tasks over a few days in the show, the entire scene was filmed in one take, further emphasizing the talent present in the cast and crew.
Unfortunately, what restricts “Kidding” from becoming an exceptional show is how staged it feels at times. In the fourth episode, “Bye, Mom,” Greer overflows with emotion in a long tirade during the episode’s last minutes, but it feels disingenuous. Viewers are often reminded that they are just watching a television show because while the characters are well-written, the connections between them feel inauthentic. 
As a result, “Kidding” lacks a sense of empathy that would have greatly elevated it. Although there are no glaring flaws in the show, it does not leave a resonant, lasting impact.
With only five episodes released, it is concerning to see what the show’s future will hold. “Kidding” feels like it works better as a mini-series than a long-running, multi-season program, as its impressive cinematography and editing are ambitious. Additionally, many character arcs feel like they’ve already reached a halfway point. 
Perhaps, Carrey and Gondry have the series’ heaviest moments saved for the season’s last episodes. Judging from these five episodes, reaching the same impact the pair achieved in “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” feels like a longshot. But given the show’s potential direction and viability, it is certainly possible.

The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism held a research seminar called “Race, Ethnicity and Digital Communications Policy Debates: Making the Case for Critical Race Frameworks within Communications Policy Issues” on Monday.
The opening speaker was Lauren Sowa, who shared her research on the breakdown of casting descriptions for roles in television. In her presentation she pointed out several questions about the politics of representation in the entertainment industry. She questions whether minority actors are provided roles, whether ethnicities are stereotyped and whether other categories such as gender, sexuality and disability are represented.
“Beyond studying the inclusion of underrepresented identities in the media, it is crucial to examine the ways in which these characters falls into categories such as gender, race, sexuality and disability are portrayed,” Sowa said.
Rachel Moran and Matthew Bui, two doctoral students in the communications program, presented their research regarding how certain civil rights and racial minority advocacy groups have used the debates surrounding internet policy issues like net neutrality to serve the needs of underrepresented constituents. 
“We were seeing these gaps in the literature in terms of race,” Bui said. “The racial inequalities are described but not problematized. So how do we integrate politizations of structural power dynamics? And how do we draw from critical race theory, as well as other frameworks, and think about how does race intersect with these issues…not just on a descriptive level, but actually trying to address structural changes.”
Their research questions centered around working in those communities that are consumer advocates for people of color and how that information might help people reconfigure policy on the national scale. Moran and Bui took a case study approach by examining three cases to look at a variety of communities of color and variants across types of activist organizations related to telecommunications issues and policy. 
The first case that they studied was that of the NAACP’s role in the net neutrality debates; the second was related to the idea of set-top box liberalization; and the third was a case study of the tribal international carrier, which is a group that is trying to build broadband infrastructure across tribal lands in the United States. Each of these cases showed a different side of minority activism and the telecommunications industry.
“These are all …different case studies and we had to work with what we had available, so we were primarily looking at documents from these organizations and what they stated as their policy or their stances toward issues, [and] also the press coverage about the issue,” said Moran.
The duo went on to explain how it is more important than ever in this political climate to be aware of the needs and concerns that have gone unaddressed and there is a realization that there is an obligation to do something for those who do not have a voice. Their paper shows how beneficial it would be to enable grassroots organizations to implement change in internet policy. 
Bui and Moran’s research paper was awarded the Charles Benton Junior Scholar Award which recognizes scholarship in the field of digital inclusion and broadband adoption.

Where are our heroes when we need them the most?
This question is prominent in Mark Medoff’s Obie Award-winning play “When You Comin’ Back, Red Ryder?”, which the School of Dramatic Arts will perform at the Scene Dock Theatre starting Friday. 
First performed in 1973, the play is a tense drama that tells the story of a hostage situation inside of a New Mexico diner. 
The play was conceived during a turbulent period in American history: the end of the Vietnam War. The cast and crew (consisting almost entirely of seniors at SDA) are eager to remind viewers that the play’s message of heroism and injustice is equally relevant in today’s political climate. 
“The play does take place almost 30 years ago, but it’s a very similar sort of searching that people have now,” said Ian Stewart Riley, a senior who plays Teddy, a Vietnam War veteran turned drug smuggler. 
The characters’ search for a savior in the face of physical threat and danger resembles the wider prevalence of oppression in present-day society, bringing to mind issues like the #MeToo movement, continued plight in Palestine and others.
The cast warns that some elements of the play might be uncomfortable: in its entirety, “Red Ryder” makes for a harrowing show featuring depictions of blood, violence and physical and verbal abuse toward women. But these details are necessary to the play’s realism and overall purpose.
“I hope [viewers] leave this place questioning everything about themselves,” said senior Matthew Aberly, who plays white collar worker Richard Ethredge.
The show hopes to evoke an intense emotional response from both the cast and audience. According to director Nathan Singh, the play is one of the last major projects that many of the cast members will take part in before graduating, but the passion to be found in this performance is bittersweet when three to four years of hard work is over.
“If you say you’re an actor, they think you’re from cinema,” said senior Nathaniel Foster, who plays gas station owner Lyle Striker. “I would love to see the community of USC come to see these awesome plays and recognize SDA for the creative entity it is.” 
Senior Hansberry Quay, who plays the role of diner owner Tommy Clark, makes a comparison between this show and the 1972 musical “Cabaret,” which is set in 1930s Berlin in the last days of the Weimar Republic before the rise of the Third Reich. 
“There’s a famous line [in the musical], and it’s like, ‘If you’re not against it, you’re for it,’” he said. “And I think that’s similar to what goes on in this play, because it’s asking the question to the audience — are you going to stand up for people when they are marginalized, and made to feel discriminated against?” 
“Red Ryder” invites viewers to stop waiting around, wake up and find the heroes society needs within themselves. 
SDA’s  rendition of “When You Comin’ Back, Red Ryder?” premieres on Friday, Oct. 12, at the Scene Dock Theatre. Tickets are available at the USC Ticket Office and on the SDA website.

Jessie Chang | Daily Trojan
This month marks the 20th anniversary of the creation of Fair Trade USA, a nonprofit organization designed to help facilitate a more equitable global trade model for small farms. The nonprofit regulates business practices, wages and prices to create a level playing field for all. Fair Trade USA allows companies that comply with their standards to use Fair Trade USA’s label on their products, ensuring that customers’ purchases support the community that produced the product. When we buy products with fair trade labels, we pay a small market premium that returns to the developing community responsible for the product.
However, Fair Trade USA isn’t the only organization that can grant products a “fair trade” label, and each organization adheres to different standards to designate a product as fair trade. As a result, consumers often don’t know where their coffee is sourced from or if it’s ethically produced. 
Coffee is one of the most valuable commodities exported from developing countries, and the primary product that fair trade organizations are concerned with. Looking at the market growth of the last year alone, international coffee exports amounted to 10.1 million bags in July 2018, compared with 9.7 million in July 2017, according to the International Coffee Organization. Though brands like Patagonia, Dole and Pottery Barn all pay fees to Fair Trade USA for a “fair trade” label, coffee is Fair Trade USA’s biggest market.
Fair Trade USA came under scrutiny in 2011, when it cut ties with its umbrella organization, Fair Trade International, partly because of changes Fair Trade USA suggested. Critics thought the changes watered down standards and increased the number of “fair trade” designated products, yielding more fees that Fair Trade USA could collect, according to The New York Times. Another contested change was to allow larger farms the fair trade designation, which would reverse the original intent of fair trade — to ensure that smaller farms have a market to sell to.
The organization’s original strict certification requirements for fair trade designation made it difficult for producers to become certified, creating economic imbalances, according to a 2011 article by the Stanford Social Innovation Review. A group of growers, roasters and importers believed that fair trade was little more than an empty title, as Fair Trade USA lacked data on how fair trade-designated products reduce poverty in developing countries. 
The efficacy of Fair Trade USA was contested both before the split and after, but regardless, a new, redesigned label for Fair Trade USA entered an already saturated group of designators. This confused consumers and created another list of regulations and practices for fair trade farms that no one would take the time to read. Increased competition between accreditation organizations also means organizations may lower their standards to attract more businesses and yield higher returns — the very act of which Fair Trade USA was accused.
Since then, retailers like Starbucks have shied away from the language of “fair trade,” favoring other methods of assuring ethically sourced beans for customers. Starbucks does not use a fair trade label on its beans and has no mention of it on its site in regards to sourcing. Instead, Starbucks promotes an initiative it helped develop — the Sustainable Coffee Challenge, a “commitment to coffee the world’s first fully sustainable agricultural product.” They also gauge their supplying farms by compliance with Coffee and Farmer Equity Practices regulations.
Similarly, Peet’s Coffee created a program called Farmer Assistance, with the goal of “assist[ing] farmers who have the potential to grow the specialty coffee the world now demands, but who, for a variety of reasons, lack the techniques needed to do so.”
As consumers, we often don’t know where our coffee comes from. We don’t see the cafe’s purchasing processes, and the beans we buy aren’t wholesale or directly from producers. How do we consume conscientiously then? 
Read the labels. When you buy beans, check out what tags are on the bag. Even if you aren’t aware of the specifications of each accreditation, a brand marked with a “fair trade” label, whether it be from Fair Trade USA, Fair Trade International or another fair trade organization, it does meet standards of some kind to earn a label. 
Buy locally! The West Coast’s coffee game is strong, and getting to know your local roasters and farmers (yes, even Blue Bottle is serving California grown coffee now) can inform your decision of which types of coffee to drink. 
As a Bay Area native, I have been a long time fan of San Jose-based Chromatic Coffee. They have such close ties with their producers and importers that they list these individuals on their website and showcase interviews and behind-the-scenes videos, inviting customers to get to know the producers of their beans.
Stay informed. As with all social issues, being informed is a big way consumers can support the cause.
Know the different growing methods and how they rank ethically. Shade-grown, bird-friendly, organic — these are all also scales to gauge coffee farming and distribution from an environmental, health or labor standpoint.
Conscientious coffee consumption can be difficult. But if you are powered by a daily caffeine fix, you can take some time out of your day to be cognizant of the people who make that possible. It’s the least you can do to espresso gratitude.

Last week, Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed as an associate justice on the United States Supreme Court after a contentious journey to the seat. Kavanaugh was widely considered a lock to take the place of former justice Anthony Kennedy until September, when allegations of sexual assault were leveled against Kavanaugh by multiple women. The first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, captured the nation’s attention with her testimony, and Kavanaugh fired back with an equally dramatic one. The FBI started and ended a week-long investigation into Ford’s allegation, and even after all that, Kavanaugh was confirmed and is scheduled to start hearing cases this week.
Kavanaugh’s resumé, connections and capability weren’t the only factors affecting his confirmation to the Supreme Court. The vast gap in the Democratic and Republican parties’ agendas heavily influenced Kavanaugh’s appointment and obscured the true focus of the Kavanaugh hearings: sexual assault. There are certain issues that should not be politicized or exploited by either party, and sexual assault is one of them.      
“Unfortunately, the entire process [of Kavanaugh’s confirmation] was polarized,” communication professor Karen North told me. She noted that Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court wouldn’t have been likely if not for a recent change in Senate procedures.
When the procedure to end a filibuster in the Senate was changed in 2017 to allow a simple majority to end a filibuster or bring a Supreme Court nominee to a vote, we moved from a more collaborative system to a majority rules system. 
In 2017, Republican members of Congress declared that only 51 senators were needed to secure a cloture vote for Supreme Court appointees, making it substantially easier for a majority party to elect federal judges to the Supreme Court. The GOP has full power to appoint a federal judge if it chose to invoke it — which it did — and has been able to bring extremely conservative judges, such as Kavanaugh, to the Supreme Court because of this.
Sen. Susan Collins even pointed out how current political conditions already determined how Kavanaugh’s nomination process would occur before his position was even officially announced.
“The president nominated Brett Kavanaugh on July 9,” Collins said. “Within moments of that announcement, special interest groups raced to be the first to oppose him, including one organization, [the Women’s March] that didn’t even bother to fill in the judge’s name on its pre-written press release — they simply wrote that they opposed ‘Donald Trump’s nomination of XX to the Supreme Court of the United States.’”
It was clear that some members of Congress did not vote for our newest Supreme Court justice with the democratic process and judicial ability in mind, but rather acted in the interest of hindering the political party that they oppose. These partisan tactics, much less those that exploit the traumatic experiences of one brave woman, have no place in our political system.        
Regardless of the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh, his confirmation process to the U.S. Supreme Court was undemocratic — and Democrats and Republicans are both to blame.          
If it weren’t for the thick fog of political polarization, I believe that our country would have seen a more successful trial regarding Ford’s case as well. I believe that everyone wants to see justice for victims of sexual assault. This matter did not have to be made into a polarizing one; this news did not have to cause Democrats to be the ones who support victims of sexual assault and make Republicans those who turn a blind eye to those accused.
If not for our division, we perhaps could have seen a unified, sincere and thorough assessment of this case. The issues brought out in the #MeToo movement are neither liberal nor conservative. Issues of sexual assault are important to our entire nation, and are too important to be marred by the political horse race.

Lillian Zeng | Daily Trojan
Two weeks ago, I wrote an opinion piece on why Ben Shapiro should not be permitted to speak at USC. One week ago, Shapiro spoke on campus. In the intervening days, the Young Americans for Freedom, who hosted Shapiro on Thursday, canceled 150 student tickets. Many of those tickets belonged to the leaders of various cultural assemblies at USC. 
Yet because USC apparently does not care about discrimination against its students — or the very real fear many felt because of Shapiro’s presence on campus — the event went on as planned. Even after YAF cancelled student tickets, there was apparently no reason to withdraw the $4,100 in funding from Undergraduate Student Government. Considering the identities of the students whose tickets were canceled, it’s difficult to rationalize how the Office of Campus Activities found no evidence of bias.
On Thursday, hundreds of students who disagreed with Shapiro’s access to an official platform at USC crowded around Tommy Trojan to protest the speaker. Frightened by their own school’s lack of sensitivity, they sought safety and community in each other.
The other folks gathered near Bovard Auditorium, along with a buffer of police officers. And they weren’t afraid to capitalize on the protestors’ fear that evening.
Shapiro supporters with “Make America Great Again” hats would periodically interject to demean the rally. Some of them walked through the crowd, attempting to debate with individual protestors, hoping to stir up a reaction. When they didn’t get what they wanted, they’d walk away, writing us off as close-minded liberals who couldn’t handle some good-natured discourse. 
One of them punched my friend in the back and called him a “queer.” I looked at the cops standing inside the gates and asked myself who they were really here to protect, because I knew it wasn’t the protestors. 
Shapiro supporters who disrupted the rally didn’t want to talk, they wanted to intimidate. They wanted to provoke a response because they knew it would be painted the next day as an overreaction on student protestors’ part.
As the march moved past Bovard in a collective attempt to insist that our humanity be respected, the folks lined up to see Shapiro taunted protestors. People among the event attendees yelled at us. One protestor told me she was called the n-word. Some students with “Free Palestine” posters were labeled anti-Semites.
In all honesty, I’m so exhausted. I’m so exhausted of people asking why this matters and with institutions portraying students as reactionaries for not rolling over and politely yielding to injustice. I’m exhausted with people infantilizing our politics. Most of all, I’m tired of the status quo and of authorities regarding me as irrational or volatile for expressing any kind of dissatisfaction. 
It’s nothing new. The path to progress always faces roadblocks from self-righteous advocates of civility. It meets resistance from the same people who tell you to trust in the institutions that let us down over and over again.
These people remind me of a passage written by Martin Luther King Jr. (one of the few radicals they seem to trust) in his letter from Birmingham Jail. He wrote that people who praise order more than justice hinder progress more than anyone else. In his words, “Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.”
I struggle to see the difference between the paternalistic attitude that moderates took toward King and the attitude they take today toward progressives. Such moderates, as King said, feel they can “set the timetable for another man’s freedom.” They ask for civility; they tell us that listening to people who disagree with us is part of learning and growing. That the solution is more speech, not less speech. This is nothing but misdirection. 
Shapiro believes that transgender people are mentally ill. He’s advocated for the forced removal of Palestinians from Judea, Samaria, Gaza and Israel, saying that “decapitating” the leadership of the Palestinian Authority doesn’t go far enough because “the ideology of the Palestinian population is indistinguishable from that of its terrorist leadership.” Transgender and Palestinian students deserve a university that affirms their identity and actively decries these kinds of beliefs. 
Shapiro’s talk did not show USC’s commitment to free speech and to expanding its students’ intellects with “controversial ideas.” The University effectively told us that it cares more about letting right-leaning students host their leader than it does about the safety and dignity of its marginalized students. 
That’s why we needed to protest. We needed to show the targets of Shapiro’s hate that they have allies when the University fails to show up for them. I just hope that USC thinks harder about what side of history it wants to be on.
