Content warning: This article contains reports of sexual assault and violence.The Interfraternity Council is investigating multiple reports of “potential violations” of its suspension of fraternity activities, the organization confirmed in an email to the Daily Trojan Sunday.
“The Interfraternity Council has received multiple reports of potential violations of the moratorium on social events,” the email read. “IFC Chapters that violate the ban on social events will be held accountable by the Interfraternity Council, up to and including suspension and removal from the Interfraternity Council.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan Thursday evening, IFC wrote that all social events are suspended while the “Council takes deliberate action” following the DPS email Wednesday night about drugging and sexual assault at Sigma Nu.
The suspension will be enforced by the University and the Department of Public Safety, according to communitywide emails sent over the weekend. 
Multiple students reported violations of the ban on social events to the Daily Trojan over the weekend, including invites at locations outside the Row. The Daily Trojan also obtained photos of fraternity members at an off-campus event and multiple reports that the event took place, but could not verify whether these events were fraternity approved. 
A fraternity whose members were involved told the Daily Trojan in an email that there were no fraternity sanctioned events over the weekend, and that its invite, originally planned for Oct. 22, was canceled that day at 6 p.m.
In a phone call Sunday, the event planning company — The Perfect Event, Inc. — confirmed the fraternity’s version of events. 
In an email to the Daily Trojan Sunday, the University said violations of the fraternities’ suspension on social events “may result in disciplinary action against the student organization and its individual members.”

Content warning: This article contains reports of sexual assault and violence. 
The Department of Public Safety has received additional reports of sexual assault and drugging — including at fraternities other than Sigma Nu — since Wednesday, according to a communitywide email Saturday.
The email also mentioned increased security measures around W. 28th St. and enforcement of the Interfraternity Council’s voluntary suspension of social activities by the University until further notice.
Demonstrations continued Sunday down the Row, with students gathering outside the Sigma Nu fraternity house throughout the day, and around 20 students arriving at 6:30 p.m. After DPS’ announcement that there were additional sexual assaults at other fraternity houses, some demonstrators marched down the Row. 
There have been various reports of sexual assault at USC fraternities in the past.
In 2006, the Pi Kappa Phi National Council revoked the charter of the USC chapter after sexual assault reports stemming from a 2005 fraternity party, according to a 2006 Daily Trojan article. The fraternity recharted in 2010, until the University stopped recognizing it in 2019 after hazing allegations. 
In 2009, the University placed the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity on interim suspension after a student reported being sexually assaulted. The student consumed punch that could have contained an “unknown toxicant,” according to an LAPD press release at the time. While only one student reported a sexual assault, there were likely more victims, according to a 2009 Daily Trojan article. 
In 2013, the National Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity banned the Sigma Phi Epsilon California Beta Chapter for a minimum of five years after sexual misconduct reports. The fraternity does not currently exist at USC.

Content warning: This article contains references to sexual assault and violence.
Holding candles, having a moment of silence and sharing experiences, students gathered outside the Sigma Nu fraternity house Friday night for a vigil honoring sexual assault survivors following two days of protests after Wednesday’s sexual assault reports from the Department of Public Safety.
Speakers voiced support for survivors and criticized patriarchal systems, the University’s lack of transparency and the culture that allows for sexual assault, racism and homophobia within Greek life. Other students came forward and shared their own experiences with sexual assault, some of which occurred on that very street. 
“First off, I want to say to survivors: ‘We stand with you. We are fighting for your justice.’ This work does not end tonight. It does not end when all of these rapists are in prison. And it does not end until USC does more than meaningless words. And it does not end until patriarchy, in all of its shitty ways, is dismantled,” said Harriet Taylor, a senior majoring in English, narrative studies and literary editing and publishing. 
More than 30 students gathered in the USC Village at 6 p.m. holding signs before walking to the Row to join the vigil while chanting “Frat Row has got to go!”
During the vigil, a community-wide email sent by President Carol Folt and Acting Vice President for Student Affairs Monique Allard received criticism from multiple speakers as an insufficient and late response, sent nearly 48 hours after DPS’ initial email.
“USC has a history of sweeping things under the rug,” one speaker said. “We can’t allow this to be swept under the rug anymore. 48 hours is still too long.”
Mariana Kramer de Luna, a prevention specialist at Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention mentioned RSVP’s underfunding and the lack of urgency USC has when conducting investigations.
“The moment a girl comes forward and she reports and she takes the time to relive her story, USC will turn a blind eye and give an investigation. But what the investigation doesn’t tell you is the trauma and everything that she has to relive,” said Kramer de Luna, a junior majoring in political science and gender and sexuality studies. 
Earlier in the day, protesters marched to the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house, where Alyssa Delarosa, a senior majoring in psychology, used a megaphone until members left the house to see the protesters. After a confrontation outside the house, members joined the protest outside Sigma Nu and attended the vigil that night.
Hayden Miller, who attended Friday’s vigil, lived in the Sigma Nu House until Thursday, where he had been a member since the spring semester. The morning after DPS’ Wednesday email, he dissociated from the fraternity and moved out. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan Saturday, he said his decision to leave the fraternity was motivated by systemic issues within Greek life.
“If you’re part of a company and one of your co-workers goes out and does some horrific act, you don’t leave that company because it’s one co-worker in one isolated incident,” said Miller, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and economics. “But if there’s been systemic issues of whatever that horrific act is going on in the company for decades and decades, even though the majority of people are good people, you leave. You leave and you work to actively combat those things that are occurring again and again.” 
Celia Bartel, a junior majoring in political science and co-Executive Director of the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, said they question Greek life’s role in the protests.
“I don’t really see how people who are involved in Greek life can separate themselves from Greek life and also support our cause here, which is to stop sexual assault in the USC community,” Bartel said. “Because it is so perpetuated through Greek life.”
Former Sigma Nu President Ryan Schiffilea is the “main suspect” in the reports and was questioned by the Los Angeles Police Department last week. There have been no arrests or charges, LAPD confirmed to the Daily Trojan Friday.
Delarosa said she knocked on fraternity doors, shouting through her megaphone for members to join the vigil.
“To all the brothers that are here tonight from different fraternities. I understand that you have found your community in your home. I’m sure one of your brothers has information that will give these victims justice,” Kramer de Luna said. “I strongly urge you to start thinking about your brothers who actually care about this and to tell everyone that you know to take accountability.”
Kramer De Luna said she hopes for University action and accountability.
“USC, if you are watching this. If you are listening to anything your students are saying, please for once in your whole institutional life, give a crap about your students,” Kramer de Luna said. “Stop caring about the money, stop raising tuition for the fact that no change ever gets made in this school until students are fucking raped.”
