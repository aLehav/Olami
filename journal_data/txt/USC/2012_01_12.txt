Every USC fan aches for a win in this crosstown showdown.
The Women of Troy crave a victory just as badly — not only to overcome their rival Bruins in a game of basketball, but to take a crucial step on their road to a Pac-12 championship and a berth to the NCAA tournament in March.
Sky high · USC is looking for its fourth straight win this Saturday. The Women of Troy defeated Arizona and Arizona State last week. - George Chearswat | Daily Trojan
Led by senior guards Ashley Corral and Briana Gilbreath, the Women of Troy (8-6, 3-1) will take their three-game winning streak to John Wooden Center in Westwood and face UCLA (7-8, 2-2) Saturday at 2 p.m.
Currently tied in conference play with Washington State (9-7, 3-1), a win will also widen USC’s conference lead over UCLA to two games and maintain its proximity to Stanford (13-1, 4-0), ranked No. 4 in the AP poll and the sole Pac-12 representative.
A victory, however, will not come easily. UCLA has beaten USC in its last four meetings, despite USC holding a 43-37 record all-time against its rival.
In their most recent encounter, the Bruins pulled out a 74-67 victory at the Galen Center in February last season.
“They’ve been a great defensive team.” Corral said. “Their [defense] has hindered us in the past, but I definitely think that this year, our team has strived past that.”
The Bruins have had several personnel changes since their last trip to USC, including the loss of three starters, a season-ending injury for star senior forward Jasmine Dixon and a new head coach in Cori Close.
“I’m sure the new coaching staff they have now is just as good as the last one,” Gilbreath said. “They’re going out to win games just as hard as we are.”
Both teams will have had a week of rest before their face-off tomorrow.
The Women of Troy began a two-game road trip on Jan. 5 by dismantling Arizona State 60-48 behind Corral’s 21-point game. Two days later, they rode Gilbreath’s 17 points and Corral’s seven assists in a narrow 72-67 victory at Arizona.
Corral is four assists away from tying former USC women’s basketball forward and gold medalist Cheryl Miller for No. 6 all-time in assists, although she insists that the record is barely on her mind.
“If it happens, it happens,” Corral said. “There are more important things than me getting that record.”
USC junior guard Christina Marinacci has also stepped up her game in the Pac-12, averaging 13.5 points and 2.9 offensive rebounds in conference games. She scored a career-high 23 points with 9-for-14 shooting in their sole conference loss against Stanford on Dec. 29.
“I’ve been looking to be more aggressive in terms of taking it to the basket, and I’ve had mismatches that the coaches have recognized, and I’ve capitalized on those,” Marinacci said.
Sophomore forward Cassie Harberts also looks to continue her strong conference play. In a win against California on Dec. 31, Harberts sank a career-high 13 free throws on her way to a 23-point, 9-rebound performance.
On the other bench, senior guard Rebekah Gardner and junior guard Markel Walker will head the Bruins’ efforts in pulling their overall record to .500. Gardner leads UCLA in scoring with 14.7 points per game, while Walker pulls out an average of 8.9 rebounds per game.
Gilbreath, who averages 6.4 rebounds, hopes that the team will come together in an effort to dispel Walker’s effectiveness on the boards.
“[Rebounding] is going to be huge for us because we’re usually undersized, but as far as UCLA is concerned, they’re a little smaller than we are,” Gilbreath said. “We have to stick to our game plan as far as boxing out and limiting them to one shot.”
Despite the magnitude of any USC-UCLA clash, the Women of Troy insist this game is no different than the rest, and they continue to have their eyes set on hoisting the conference trophy at the end of the season.
“Every game is one step closer to the Pac-12 championship, and UCLA is just another team in our way,” Corral said.

Starting today, members of the No. 1 USC men’s tennis team have their last opportunities to hone their individual games before embarking on a spring season that might culminate in the Trojans’ fourth-consecutive NCAA championship.
Ten Trojans will join a 32-player singles draw and battle for a title at the Sherwood Collegiate Cup in Thousand Oaks, Calif., starting today through Monday.
The tournament, which includes players from No. 5 Baylor, No. 6 Stanford and No. 9 UCLA, will be USC’s last action before beginning its spring season with a doubleheader against Loyola Marymount and UC Santa Barbara on Jan. 21.
“We play [the Sherwood Cup] just to see where everyone’s at, and it’s a good way to start [the season],” USC coach Peter Smith said.
USC has packed the top eight seeds of the bracket with five Trojans, including ITA National Player of the Year senior Steve Johnson, who returns to collegiate action after taking the fall semester off to train for the professional circuit.
Johnson enters the Sherwood Cup seeded No. 1 alongside fellow senior Daniel Nguyen at No. 3. Sophomores Ray Sarmiento and Emilio Gomez possess the No. 2 and No. 4 seed, respectively, and freshman Yannick Hanfmann rounds out the top eight standing at No. 7.
Sophomore Corey Smith and freshmen Eric Johnson, Jonny Wang, Jordi Vives and Roberto Quiroz will also join the quest for an individual title. This will be Vives’ and Quiroz’s first collegiate action as spring additions to the tennis team.
Each of the Trojans will also pair up into five teams and participate in a 16-team doubles draw. Hanfmann and Steve Johnson will join forces as the No. 2 seed and begin play against Stanford’s Daniel Ho and Jamin Ball.
With more than two months of rest since their last tournament, the young, yet promising, Trojans hope to settle back onto the court and polish their plays at Thousand Oaks before beginning their journey for yet another NCAA championship.

It happened almost in an instant. A promising career derailed yet again by another injury.  Senior guard Jacki Gemelos tore  her anterior cruciate ligament against Texas A&M back in mid-December. Another season lost, another surgery and another year of rehab.
This was supposed to be the year the USC women’s basketball team took the next step. This was supposed to be the year Gemelos would help lead a squad filled with veterans to its first NCAA tournament appearance since 2006.
But there was no time to dwell on what could have been. Conference play began two games after Gemelos’ injury. Before the Stockton, Calif. native went down, USC was projected to finish second in the Pac-12 behind Stanford. The Women of Troy received one first-place vote, their highest vote since the 2006-2007 season.
Sure, her loss hurts. But it won’t be as bad for this USC basketball team, as evidenced by their results. I can guarantee it surely isn’t as bad as the Trojans losing senior guard Jio Fontan.
The men’s team is winless in Pac-12 play (0-4) and is struggling to generate offensive production. They’re ranked 341st out of 344 NCAA Division I teams, averaging 53.9 points per game.
That’s definitely tough to stomach.
But you shouldn’t have to worry. If you want to see another basketball team at USC, go catch the Women of Troy.
Since losing Gemelos, the Women of Troy are 4-1. They are 3-1 in Pac-12 play, with their only loss coming to then-No. 4 Stanford. After that loss, however they routed Cal by 20 at the Galen Center and swept the Arizona schools on the road.
The Women of Troy have a couple of things going for them despite the loss of third-leading-scorer Gemelos. They have veteran leadership that has dealt with this before, they have played without Gemelos, and they have dealt with  the loss of other players to injury before — they can certainly do it again for the rest of the season.
Senior guards Ashley Corral and Briana Gilbreath, who both have racked up more than 1,300 points during their time at USC, are certainly holding down the backcourt with Gemelos out. Corral has eclipsed the 20-point mark twice since stepping into the starting lineup when Gemelos went down and Gilbreath has strung together another all-around year, leading the Women of Troy defensively while being one of their main offensive contributors. Both have put together impressive resumes at USC thus far, but they’ve never been to the Big Dance.
And though just a small sample size, the Women of Troy are averaging almost two more points per contest (65 with and 66.8 without) and holding their opponents to less points per game (61.4 points with and 60.2 without).
In the frontcourt, junior forward Christina Marinacci and sophomore forward Cassie Harberts have solidified a starting lineup. Marinacci posted a career-high 23 points in the win against California and Harberts is building off an impressive freshman campaign in which she was elected to the All-Pac-10 All-Freshman team.
The Women of Troy might have lost one of the most important pieces to their squad early in the season, but it’s not too farfetched to see this team make a strong run at an NCAA tournament berth.
According to RealTimePRI.com, USC boasts the No. 2 toughest schedule nationally. The team faced two top-10 teams during the preseason: Notre Dame and defending NCAA champion Texas A&M. Despite losing both games, these types of games prepared them for what is to come should they be selected in March.
Gemelos’ injury surely hurt, there’s no question about it. But this team was built tough enough to survive the blow. The third time is the charm under Cooper: This is the year that it happens.

The USC men’s basketball team’s recent free fall has become puzzling — at least somewhat to USC coach Kevin O’Neill.
Though the Trojans (5-12, 0-4) have dropped eight of their nine last games, their current five-game slide marks a season-high record and they are the only Pac-12 team to remain winless in conference play. The third-year coach, however, insists it’s not all bad news.
Looking for answers · USC has lost a season-high five straight games. The Trojans hope to break their losing streak when they host the Bruins on Sunday at the Galen Center. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
“I go through all of our tapes and I like the shots we get,” O’Neill said. “I like the fact [that] we don’t turn the ball over. I like how we play defensively. I like how we rebound.”
The results haven’t all been pretty, but USC hopes the shots will finally start come Sunday, when it hosts UCLA at the Galen Center, where it hasn’t lost to its crosstown rival since 2009. Last week, when the Bruins (9-7, 2-2) earned back-to-back wins over Arizona and Arizona State, the Trojans arguably hit their low point last weekend.
O’Neill’s bunch stumbled, losing 62-53 against the Sun Devils, who featured just six scholarship players. Three days later, they made just one of 15 3-point attempts in an 11-point loss to Arizona.
USC’s offensive woes, however, haven’t been limited to just one weekend. The team is averaging 53.9 points per game, good for 341st in the country. It’s also shooting just 39.9 percent from the field 309th nationally.
“I’m telling these guys to keep shooting the ball,” O’Neill said. “It’s like the lottery, you can’t win unless you buy a ticket, so you have to keep shooting the ball.”
Injuries have complicated the team’s efforts for anything close to a midseason surge. Junior forward Aaron Fuller, who leads USC in rebounding with 6.2 points per game and is also the team’s second-leading scorer with 10.8 points per game, is currently day-to-day with a torn labrum in his left shoulder, which caused him to miss the second half of Sunday’s loss to Arizona. He was held out of practice Tuesday.
Fuller originally sustained the injury during a preseason scrimmage against Air Force and the left-handed forward has been forced to shoot right-handed for most of the season.
“Hopefully I can be ready to go by Sunday,” Fuller said. If Fuller can’t go, USC will boast just seven scholarship players, including junior center James Blasczyk, who has been held out of practices this season because of an injury to his right foot. And the list doesn’t stop there. Sophomore forward Evan Smith, out with a shoulder injury, and senior guard Jio Fontan, out with a knee injury, are still expected to miss the remainder of the season.
“We’ve been devastated by graduation and injuries unfortunately,” O’Neill said.
UCLA shouldn’t necessarily make things any easier on the Trojans, either. In its last game, sophomore center Josh Smith looked as good as ever, coming off the bench to record a season-high 18 points in the 17-point victory.
“They’re returning a ton of players,” O’Neill said of the Bruins, who have won seven of their last nine games. “I think they’re a very good team that is only going to get better.”
For USC to be successful, it will once again be forced to rely heavily on sophomore guard Maurice Jones, who is second in the country in minutes per game, averaging 38.65 per contest. Jones, who leads the team in scoring with 14.3 points per game, is just one of four players nationwide to average more than 38 minutes per contest.
“He’s our best creator,” O’Neill said of the second-year guard. “He’s the only guy we have who played at all last year. It’s a lot to ask of him, as a sophomore, to get you 20 a game, every game.”
Sophomore center Dewayne Dedmon, who has averaged just under 10 points per game in conference play, has been helping out Jones. The 7-foot center, who is second on the team in rebounding with 5.6 rebounds per game, had been playing with a stress injury on his right foot for most of the season, but Dedmon finally appears to be symptom-free and nearly 100 percent.
“We’re just about to get everything going because we have a young team,” Dedmon said. “Everybody is trying to get acclimated to the speed of Division I basketball.”
Tip-off is scheduled for 6 p.m. and will be televised on FSN.

Don’t let its location fool you — the new pizza joint, 800 Degrees, in Westwood is no foe. The restaurant, which opened its doors to the public on Jan. 3, serves certified Neapolitan pizza cooked in wood burning ovens.
And when they say “certified,” they mean it. There are specific standards that must be upheld for Neapolitan pizzas, which is an achievement this restaurant prides itself on.
Delectable fix · Fresh ingredients and affordable prices make for the perfect new pizzeria for college students to try. - Photo courtesy of 800 Degrees
Founded by Umami Burger creator Adam Fleischman and partner Allen Ravert, and headed by chef Anthony Carron, 800 Degrees is already developing new locations for the franchise. Fleischman is certainly no stranger to entrepreneurship, and it seems this pizza joint could become the next big thing.
With the restaurant’s simple set-up, customers line up at a long pizza bar and order their pie of choice. The possibilities are endless. Customers can order restaurant-designed pizzas ranging from the classic Margherita pizza to specialty pies, such as the Prosciutto and the Capricciosa — made with artichokes, mushrooms, olives and ham.
If 800 Degrees’ combinations don’t appeal, customers can create their own pizza, customizing toppings fit for their specific tastes. And instead of the typical, run-of-the-mill toppings, 800 Degrees offers unique, delicious options, such as smoked provolone cheese, rosemary ham and caramelized onions.
This variety and quality is the essence of 800 Degrees. The restaurant takes simple food that is accessible to the masses and elevates it to a true gourmet eating experience. The restaurant uses the best ingredients — from locally made fresh mozzarella to handcrafted crusts to fresh tomato sauce — and it shows. This attention to detail is what makes the otherwise simple food seriously impressive.
The Margherita pizza, made with homemade tomato sauce, large chunks of fresh mozzarella and leaves of basil served atop a chewy, charred crust, is considered one of the signatures at 800 Degrees. The pizza shows off a rustic elegance in its simplicity. It is distinctly un-American in its sparseness, and it’s not drenched in greasy processed cheese, which might turn away some diners. Regardless, the pizza is undeniably good.
The Prosciutto pizza, topped with fresh mozzarella, garlic, prosciutto and wild arugula, is another standout dish. The dough has a robust but not overpowering garlic flavor, and the chunks of rich, gooey mozzarella complement the peppery kick of the arugula and the salt of the prosciutto.
800 Degrees also offers salads, such as the Gorgonzola salad, which comes with dried cranberries and walnuts — a flavorful, light companion to any pizza. As if that was not enough, they also offer gelato from L.A. Creamery Artisan Ice Cream, as well as a selection of 109 — that’s right, 109 — different beverages from their automated, Ferrari-designed soda machine.
On top of the delicious food, 800 Degrees’ atmosphere is the perfect hybrid of modern and homey. The restaurant is outfitted with black and white tile walls, high ceilings, brown booths and tables in the dining area, giving the interior a clean, cozy look.
The lines move quickly thanks to the fast-cooking wood burning oven, which delivers pizza promptly.
The best part about 800 Degrees? It’s insanely reasonable prices: Pizzas start at $5. The price goes up with more complex pies, but even the most decked-out, expensive pizza is only $11.
There’s not much to dislike about the restaurant. 800 Degrees is an energetic place, comfortable yet sleek, and best of all, there is fantastic food for  the economically savvy prices.
All in all, 800 Degrees is a very hot — pun intended — restaurant.

Vinyl records are not just for DJs to spin any more.
These hunky, 12-inch pieces of wax are quickly becoming the physical medium of choice among music fans.
In an age when thousands of songs can be stored on a miniscule device like an iPod Nano, younger consumers are discovering that perhaps their grandparents were right all along: Vinyl is the way to go.
And artists, too, are taking note. From smaller bands like Punchline to mainstream artists like Katy Perry, it clearly behooves artists to release a record on vinyl.
Though the landscape seems nearly apocalyptic for CD sales in the wake of the digital downloading revolution, vinyl records are providing a glimmer of hope in their niche markets.
Since 2006, vinyl record sales have grown from 858,000 per year to 3.9 million in 2011, according to SoundScan.com. In the span of five years, vinyl sales have enjoyed more than a 350 percent increase.
Why such a meteoric rise? After all, it takes effort to play a vinyl record. Record players are cumbersome compared to MP3 players, and costly — the least expensive models, such as the Numark PT01 Turntable, tend to cost more than $70.
Then there’s the issue of sound quality. Vinyl records are known for their popping, crackling noises — caused by minute amounts of dust and grime on the record — that can kick in at any moment while the album is playing.
Vinyl records also need to be meticulously cared for, as the wax can be damaged by lying flat for too long or by being exposed to excessively hot or cool temperatures.
Ironically, these downsides are what make vinyl so beloved.
There is a great amount of satisfaction to be had by setting time aside to listen to an album on vinyl because doing so makes listening to a record an immersive experience as opposed to a background activity. Vinyl records often come with especially impressive packaging, containing enlarged artwork and unique liner notes with lyrics.
As a result, vinyl records encourage people to listen to new releases as a whole instead of disjointedly listening to a few tracks before moving on to something else.
Crackle and pop noises aside, the sound quality of vinyl is remarkably warm and superior to something with digital sound — listeners with a fine ear for music will surely notice.
The sound quality is superior because digital files distributed online for download tend to be compressed versions of the songs themselves. And even the highest quality downloads cannot match the pure sounds of a vinyl record.
Though digital files are by no means bad, a careful comparison of the two media will yield the understanding that vinyl records allow people to experience all the nuances of the recording and production process to the fullest extent.
These benefits are subtle things that the casual music consumer will not notice. Vinyl needed outside support to get to the prominent standing it enjoys today.
This support is evidenced in causes such as Record Store Day, an annual event co-managed by Michael Kurtz and Carrie Colliton. Now in its fifth year, Record Store Day claims to be a “celebration of the unique culture surrounding more than 700 independently owned record stores in the USA, and hundreds of similar stores internationally,” as stated on its website.
It is a day when artists and independent record stores team up to release special albums on vinyl — available for purchase only in participating stores — that contain unreleased songs.
Naturally, avid music consumers have responded to this support, and the event is expected to post its highest sales yet when it takes place this year on April 21.
Thanks to events, such as Record Store Day, and artists’ support of the medium, vinyl will only continue to grow as years progress. As more people are discovering, flaunting a new vinyl record is becoming a lot cooler than showing off an iTunes library.
Perhaps Matthew Pryor of punk band The Get Up Kids said it best when he gave his thoughts on vinyl in an interview with AbsolutePunk.net in August 2011.
“I think [vinyl is] the slow food movement of the music industry. They are bigger, more difficult to maintain, take longer and cost more to produce but they just taste (or in this case sound) so much better,” Pryor said.
As this trend continues, record players are likely to become dorm-room essentials much like they used to be in the 1960s and 1970s. So make some room in that SUV for the next move-in day: Record players, after all, take up more space than iPods.

I’ve got to listen to my old albums now…yes I do have a record player!!  Love hearing all of my Led Zeppelin and Jethro Tull albums “crackle” and all.  Can’t wait to go back to Vintage Vinyl and Amoeba Music now.
Hi Nick,
Great article! I will always love the “crackle” of vinyl and have several albums of my own, plus my dad’s collection. Whenever you’re in Long Beach, check out Dyzzy on Vynyl and Fingerprints.

With the Golden Globes Awards show on Sunday, it’s finally time to indulge in Hollywood’s illustrious awards season.
CBS aired the People’s Choice Awards on Wednesday, but who really considers that a part of awards season? It’s probably not wise to trust a group of voters who chose Water for Elephants as best drama and Maroon 5 as band of the year — no offense, America.
Aloha George · Alexander Payne’s The Descendants received a best motion picture nomination, and George Clooney (left), featured with Shailene Woodley (right), was nominated for best actor for the 2012 Golden Globes. - Photo courtesy of FOX Searchlight
And as usual, no awards show results entirely please the masses, and the Golden Globes are no exception. Here’s a list of predicted winners — and the potential losers that should win instead.
Best Motion Picture — Drama
What will win: The Descendants
What should win: Hugo
As much as audiences and critics enjoyed proclaiming their love for George Clooney’s The Descendants, the film is not all it’s cracked up to be. Clooney’s overrated — but still commendable — work does not make a better film than Hugo.
Martin Scorsese’s decision to delve into family-friendly material with Hugo was surprising and refreshing Thankfully, his risky undertaking succeeded. He visually stunned audiences and gave us something that we love, but don’t need to keep away from the youngsters — Goodfellas, anyone?
 
Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture — Drama
Who will win: Meryl Streep (The Iron Lady)
Who should win: Rooney Mara (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo)
This is Meryl Streep’s 26th Golden Globe nomination, and based on the praise surrounding her latest release, The Iron Lady, Streep will take home her eighth Golden Globe for her portrayal of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
She deserves recognition for brilliantly embodying Thatcher on the big screen, but what audiences saw from Rooney Mara in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is equally noteworthy.
Mara, who gained most of her stardom after appearing in The Social Network, plays a psychologically bruised Lisbeth Salander — a role she landed over Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson. Mara is freaky as Salander, ruthlessly punishing her personal enemies on her way to seeking out a serial killer.
Best Motion Picture — Comedy or Musical
What will win: The Artist
What should win: Midnight In Paris
The Artist is riding a wave of popularity and acclaim, and rightly so. French director Michel Hazanavicius wrote the film, which takes viewers back to the days of silent movies — no 3-D, no explosions, just old-school cinematic genius.
Nonetheless, another comedy that garnered critical acclaim this year deserves this award instead: Midnight In Paris, Woody Allen’s highest-grossing film to date.
The involvement of big-name stars, such as Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams, might have had something to do with the film’s success, but how about those cultural references? Allen brought Ernest Hemingway, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Salvador Dalí and F. Scott Fitzgerald to life on the screen with the same sleek style as his screenplays.
Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series — Comedy or Musical
Who will win: Tina Fey (30 Rock)
Who should win: Amy Poehler (Parks and Recreation)
Tina Fey had one of her best years in 2011: Her first book, Bossypants, was extremely successful and 30 Rock, the show she created and stars in, continued to air as a critically acclaimed comedy.
But 2011 was also the year in which viewers and critics finally noticed the greatness of Parks and Recreation, in which Amy Poehler stars as Leslie Knope, the neurotic Parks Department employee who can’t help being the perfect city worker.
Parks did not receive a best comedy series nomination, but here’s to hoping that Poehler wins one for the rest of the stellar cast.
Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Comedy or Musical
Who will win: Alec Baldwin (30 Rock)
Who should win: Anyone else 
Baldwin’s portrayal of high-powered network executive Jack Donaghy showcases the actor at his finest on 30 Rock. And though the role is a personal best, seeing Baldwin collect accolade upon accolade for his work is getting old — it’s time to end the monopoly.
Matt LeBlanc (Episodes) is nominated in the same category, and he deserves kudos for finally making a relevant comeback in the post-Friends era.
Fans of Friends probably want his spinoff, Joey, permanently erased from their memories, but his new role in Episodes suffices for past disappointment.
Also, look out for Johnny Galecki to potentially snag the award for his role in The Big Bang Theory, an often-overlooked show.
Best Television Series – Drama
What will win: Game of Thrones
What should win: Homeland
The fantastical Game of Thrones was highly anticipated from the get-go, and its popularity has made the show a favorite among critics and viewers. But Homeland premiered to an equally strong fan-base and continues to pull in solid reviews and ratings.
Based on a television series that airs in Israel, the Showtime drama is a jarring venture, and Claire Daines and Damian Lewis make for an intriguing pair.
The current events-heavy plotline, however, will probably be a turnoff for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, making the safer choice — Game of Thrones — the likely winner.
Ricky Gervais hosts the Golden Globes Sunday, Jan. 15 at 5 p.m. on NBC.

Who deserves the youth vote? The predominant concerns of young voters often differ from the rest of the electorate. Older voters are primarily concerned with economic issues, such as unemployment, the depletion of Social Security funds and the budget deficit. Most presidential contenders emphasize fixing these problems.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
 
Though economic issues should continue to be part of the national conversation, not enough attention is brought to fundamental issues that must be fixed to guarantee a persistently positive future for the United States.
The gradual erosion of individual liberties and the increasingly costly and dangerous system of American imperialism have only worsened since President Barack Obama’s inauguration.
Young people — especially college students, whose education will make them the leaders of the future — will inherit the problems created and left unaddressed by today’s leaders. It is thus in students’ best interest to boldly advocate whoever will make America better in the long run. In the upcoming election, the ideal candidate, in this respect, is Rep. Ron Paul.
The tides of political sentiment are already turning, as evidenced by a surge of support for Paul and his libertarian, anti-war philosophy. In last week’s Iowa caucuses, for example, third-finishing Paul won the most votes in the 18- to 29-year-old age bracket.
Still, Paul has been dismissed by many as nothing more than a senile ex-obstetrician.
Criticism aside, there are undeniable upsides to adopting his philosophy of making liberty a top priority.
Today’s college students have grown up in a world of dire economic straits, hatred and war. We have been taught that we must cede our rights of due process in order for the corrupt to be swiftly caught.
For example, there has been widespread uproar regarding the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act. Signed at the end of last year, sections 1021 and 1022 of the act allow for the indefinite detention of suspected terrorists, including American citizens, without charge.
We need a president who will directly address these issues. Obama has only propelled these threats further by such actions as signing the NDAA. Among the GOP presidential candidates, it seems that only Paul has been outspoken regarding such threats as these.
College students must begin to bring their concerns to the public’s attention. We can spark debate that could lead to more serious change in the future.
Paul has lauded the excitement for the cause of liberty on college campuses nationwide.
Young voters should not be afraid to stand up for what they believe in, despite questions of electability. What really matters is making our voices heard. Hopefully, we will be in a position to turn things around in the future.

We’re still 10 months away from the 2012 elections, but the traditional circus of candidate groveling is well underway. The candidates are all hoping to capture a piece of the college student demographic: a cache of young and impressionable voters still untapped.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
The six big names in the Republican primary have most of the nation’s attention right now, including the collegiate population. What they shouldn’t have is our support. The idealists among contemporary college students stand to gain much more via the Democratic vote, or at least the liberal one.
Consider the issues. As college students, two of our biggest election priorities should be unwavering support for education and lower taxes for when we go out into the world to scrape a living off our entry-level jobs. A liberal platform offers these benefits.
A Republican will not be spearheading a budget that’s generous to student loans and scant on defense spending.
Instead of generating ideas on education, current Republican favorite Mitt Romney is advocating a fence along the southern border to keep illegal immigrants out.
Despite an approval rating of 46 percent according to the most recent Gallup poll, President Barack Obama retains the potential for a successful second term.
Imagine Obama’s first term was a bit like his freshman year: a learning experience. He took office during a hostile and unfamiliar environment — a nation in dire straits — and had to focus on economic stabilization rather than a full-blown rescue mission. He ran into some big problems — the health care fiasco, for one — but he also did some undeniably good work, such as the capture of Osama bin Laden and the repeal of don’t ask, don’t tell.
Putting a young, relatively inexperienced candidate like Obama into office works like an investment. Maybe everything the candidate stands for — a reinvigoration of the nation, fresh ideas, change — explodes into the picture early on. Or maybe the candidate inherits simultaneous social, economic, and military crises and has to slog through a rough boot camp. Term two could very well be when all the insight gained during that time produces just the president we were looking for.
Obama, as well as other liberal candidates who will be running independently, simply have more presidential clout: They respect the citizens of this country. We, as the up-and-coming heirs to the professional and political world, cannot underestimate the importance of an executive demonstrating concern for equal rights — across class, gender, race, sexual orientation and physical capability.
Such concern guarantees true respect of the people by its government, an essential tenet of democracy. For these issues and for the ways in which conservatism threatens to set back our country, college students should vote for the liberal side this November.

Are you serious?  Since when do Democrats believe in lowering taxes?!  Liberals are very generous when it comes to spending other people’s money (i.e., taxes) on programs that you, as a future college graduate, will not likely benefit from. When you get that first pay check and you see all the deductions, remember who you voted for.
It’s not the point that you are necessarily the sole beneficiary of your taxes. You didn’t get where you are right now on your own; others helped you get there.

While there are national youth orchestras in many parts of the world, one of its kinds has never existed in North America – until now. Carnegie Hall, once again proving its significance to the classical musical community, is establishing The National Youth Orchestra of the United States.  The first session, however, will not take place until July 2013.
The orchestra will be comprised of 120 musicians from around the country, with ages ranging from 16 to 19-years-old. They will spend a three-week residency on the campus of Purchase College of the State University of New York, where they will practice before finally getting the opportunity to perform.
The orchestra will perform first at the Purchase College Performing Arts Center and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. before moving on to bigger and better things: namely, a tour to Moscow, St. Petersburg and London. However, the orchestra will not play at Carnegie until 2014 due to renovations.
The orchestra will tour different cities and have a different conductor every season. The first season will be conducted by Valery Gergiev, a Russian conductor and opera company director as well as the music director of the St. Petersburg Marinsky Theatre. The orchestra will go to different parts of the world every year, one of the reasons why Clive Gillinson, the executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall, chose Valery Gergiev – as a way to honor and pay tribute to the places the orchestra will first tour in 2013.
Youth orchestras are special, because they give skilled teenagers opportunities to play professionally, especially if they were unable to attend a college conservatory or have not yet had the chance to do so. Actually, the youth orchestra is neither open to conservatory students in college nor to instrumental performance majors.

Though many people typically perceive the upcoming Golden Globe Awards to foreshadow the results of the Oscars, recent trends indicate that the Golden Globes maintain more of an influential affect on the Oscars rather than a foretelling one.
When the Globe announcements are complete, there are still several weeks remaining before the Oscar polls close, meaning that rather than reining in their efforts, film campaigners actually intensify their efforts, especially in the case of films that did not fare as well in the Globe nominations.
Variety Magazine  pointed out that last year, while The Kings Speech and The Social Network were dominating the Globes conversation, True Grit was overlooked, failing to earn even a single nomination. However, due to intensified campaigning from Oscar representatives for the film, it assembled a whopping ten Oscar nominations, including the coveted Best Picture.
And this trend is not novel to the past two years. In 2010, the majority of films nominated for best picture at the Oscars, including The Blind Side, An Education, and A Serious Man, received very few nominations at the Golden Globes. As evidenced by these trends, it becomes increasingly apparent that while the Globes may foreshadow Oscars results in the terms of the types and genres of films that people are paying attention to, it certainly does not predict the specific films that will receive Oscar accolades.
So what does this mean for the upcoming season? Well, for the films nominated for the prestigious awards at the Globes, probably not much. It is unlikely that The Help, The Descendants, The Ides of March and War Horse, four of the noteworthy Globe nominations for best picture, will be overlooked. However, for critically acclaimed films that did not receive Globe nominations, including The Tree of Life and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, there is certainly no guarantee these films will also be ignored at the Oscars.
With increased campaigning efforts on all their accounts, any of these films, as well as any others that may have been overlooked at the Globes, could very well secure an Oscar nomination in even the most prestigious of categories.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety daily incident log between Monday, Jan. 9, and Tuesday, Jan. 10. 
Crimes against a person
at 2:18 p.m. on Jan. 10, a staff member reported that, while standing in a parking stall she was saving for her husband, a non-USC female forced her out of the space by intentionally driving her vehicle into her. The female was subsequently detained by DPS officers and witnesses confirmed the staff member’s account of the incident. The female was then arrested and transported to 66th station for booking.

The USC Center for Enrollment Research, Policy and Practice at the Rossier School of Education began a three-day conference Wednesday focusing on the future of high school education in the United States.
The conference, called the 21st Century Knowledge and Skills: The New High School Curriculum and The Future of Assessment, will feature keynote speakers, including MIT Dean of Admission Stuart Schmill and University of Texas Vice Provost for Admissions and Enrollment Kedra Ishop.
The conference, which has 170 registered attendees, aims to re-evaluate the current high school curriculum in an attempt to better prepare high school students for college and future careers.
Jerry Lucido, executive director of CERPP, said attendees of the conference will be examining the national high school curriculum and looking at international education models of excellence.
“We live in a rapidly changing world. The question is, when are we preparing students? Are we preparing them for that world?” Lucido said. “There are a lot of complaints about multiple choice testing and how that does not help prepare students. When we think about standards that we are setting, we have to teach them how to acquire the knowledge, skills and attitude that they will need.”
Jessica Payne, a junior majoring in dental hygiene, said it is important for high school curricula to be re-evaluated in order to prepare college-bound students for the real world.
“It would be a lot smarter for students in high school to be brought out into the real world because that way, once they are out of college, they know what is ahead of them, instead of thinking about the materialistic and superficial things that high school students mainly focus on,” Payne said.
