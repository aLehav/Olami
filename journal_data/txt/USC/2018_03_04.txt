Last May, President Donald Trump signed an executive order granting agencies and organizations — primarily those that receive taxpayer funding — exemptions when denying their services to LGBTQ people. The executive order’s logic: The constitutional right to religious freedom protects certain institutions and their refusal to serve LGBTQ Americans. 
Effren Villanueva | Daily Trojan
These are being called the “license to discriminate” bills. And they are doing just that. Just last month, the Virginia House of Delegates passed HB 2025, which would give taxpayer-funded agencies the opportunity to discriminate against LGBTQ people under the guise of religion.
For a president who utilizes Twitter as a primary platform of political interaction with his constituents, it is startling that the trending hashtag #LicenseToDiscriminate did not incite governmental response, let alone concern.
Fortunately for LGBTQ students at USC, resources are abundant and, more importantly, accessible. Under the leadership of Director Rev. Kelby Harrison, the USC LGBT Resource Center’s staff — comprising professionals, graduate students and undergraduates — aims to provide students with various ways to engage with the University’s queer community. The Lavender Lounge, Queer/Trans People of Color Lounge and Sexual Orientation Support Group are few of many organizations through which students can find resources and communities. 
Furthermore, the center’s bi-weekly newsletter presents students with some opportunities for careers and internships that specifically seek to hire queer individuals or advance LGBTQ causes. Such a resource proves to be invaluable, for it makes one message blatantly clear: There must be a place for all LGBTQ individuals in the academic realm and, for that matter, in all spaces.
On the national scale, it appears the fact that 47 percent of working LGBTQ Americans experience discrimination in the workplace is enough to prompt any government change. The fact that only 19 states explicitly prohibit discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation appears, too, to be inadequate. 
To worsen the matter, many states have used Trump’s unsettling bill to create their own laws disenfranchising queer Americans. Tennessee, for instance, has enacted laws that exempt mental health counselors from being required to treat LGBTQ patients on the basis of these counselors’ religious beliefs. Meanwhile, in seven other states, child welfare agencies are legally exempted from having to accept child adoption requests submitted by queer couples, or from placing foster children in these couples’ homes.
However, do not be fooled by the word “exemption” — in these egregious examples, the word “exemption” signifies nothing other than discrimination. 
When it comes to freedom of religion, there is a belief-action standard that must be applied. Indeed, constitutional safeguards exist to secure citizens’ rights to free religious belief and exercise thereof; they do not exist, however, to be weaponized by the government, or to be used by citizens as justification for violating the law or disenfranchising certain demographics. 
At the college level, campuses have a duty to provide services and create spaces that champion inclusion. In a nation where the mere existence of LGBTQ individuals seems to be at odds with the religious beliefs of a majority, colleges must support and defend their queer students.
In comparison to other institutions of higher education, USC is doing relatively well when it comes to LGBTQ support. Yet this is not to suggest that the standard has been set high. Consider, for instance, the fact that LGBTQ college students are four times more likely to experience depression or contemplate suicide than their cisgender or heterosexual counterparts.
Something is not right. Queer people still feel excluded, silenced by surrounding communities that are reluctant to invite them to join greater conversations. 
To be living within a queer body, then, is to be surviving and fighting for an equal stake in society. 
While USC has served in some ways as a haven for LGBTQ students, this sort of support must extend beyond the university sphere. Other institutions, namely states and federal legislatures, must recognize when the right to religion is misused by some as a means of defending discrimination against LGBTQ individuals. They must recognize that, in a world where there exists constant assaults — both physical and otherwise — on individuals’ identities, LGBTQ people need extra protection. Mere acknowledgement of this issue is a start, but is nowhere near enough.

Last month, President Donald Trump discussed his plan for education policy to bolster vocational schooling options as university alternatives, while also uplifting a wider array of students. His vocal support for vocational schools aligned with the release of economics professor Bryan Caplan’s new book, The Case Against Education, in which Caplan argues against taking the traditional four-year college route — and removing public funding of it altogether. Although problematic, these two system-shocking reformation ideas suggest there is an inconsistency in what we perceive the purpose of our education system to be — one that we need to agree on soon. 
Trump intends to maneuver a larger national investment in workforce development by means of encouraging job training through vocational schooling. He posits that by opening more vocational schools and encouraging high school graduates to attain job-training, more students will be able to fulfill their potential, and in turn, contribute to the workforce. Caplan, on the other hand, argues that the existing educational system is grossly overrated and encourages students to value grades over knowledge, ultimately leading to credential inflation and a lack of preparedness for the “real world.” 
After reading Caplan’s argument and analyzing Trump’s educational plans, the narrative against traditional universities as post-high school options is not the core focus. Whether they are aware of it, at the center of both ideas for reformation lies a deeper sentiment they seem to indirectly address: How do we guarantee students’ preparedness to benefit and succeed in society?
While both Trump and Caplan develop their ideas from commendable intention — that is, changing the education system to improve society — in both cases, the ultimate outcome would be problematic. They each attempt to reform education by focusing on the future of the workforce without realizing the enriching effects of the system currently in place. The education system is a tool in society to generate the minds of upcoming generations, built with intention toward a specific idea. With no clear image of what a desirable future looks like, how can they expect to agree on education system changes?
The president’s prioritization of workforce preparedness is a sentiment most people can get behind, but his adamancy of doing so through encouraging vocational schooling is blind to the current state of the labor force. At the rate technology is developing, the rate of unemployment among industry workers is declining. Automation is decreasing the demand for human workers in trades that deal with automotive, electronic, metal, plastic and chemical industries — all trades which vocational schools are geared toward.
The lack of vocational job demand does not translate to cutting publicly funded higher education completely, although Caplan seems to think so. In his book, he contentiously argues that education is a waste of time and money for everyone involved. From a student’s perspective, they dedicate four years to receive a degree and whopping debt. From the government’s perspective, millions of federal funding pours into public education while racking up national debt. 
But beyond the issue of money, Caplan criticizes the amount of  input time lacking any valuable output, in the sense that a bachelor’s degree translates to base requirement for any entry-level position. Caplan’s solution to better student’s education is to not fix what is broken — but to cut it out completely. His all-or-nothing moxie is thought-provoking and even commendable, but impractical when it comes down to the dominating educational structure in our society.
The real issue behind these flak-attracting opinions on education reform is how we mold students to be best prepared to enter and develop society for the better. Both Trump and Caplan are seeing the education system as it is and trying to change it according to their own opinions. But what both their ideas lack is foresight. If education reform policy is aimed at increasing employment, will vocational schools fulfill that objective? If not, what will? This is what we need to start focusing on. 
The current education system leaves students with significant debt and waters down bachelor degree value, and vocational schools feed workers into a closing industry. There is, indeed, a call for education reformation. The answer is not subjective to experience, but lies in consensus on how to use education as a means of moving society in the right direction. Before drastically changing the present education system or cutting it completely, as a society, we must decide what exactly a desirable future looks like.

On its grand opening Saturday, Rance’s Chicago Pizza became the latest culinary addition to USC Village. By offering 50 percent off its personal pizzas, Rance’s drew in large crowds for their first samplings.
The 9-inch personal pizza is large enough for two people to share, especially at its listed price of $18.95. Photos courtesy of Yelp.
Rance’s ambience, though consistent, is unoriginal. Most of the restaurants in USC Village have a wooden theme, and Rance’s is probably the darkest of them all — when paired with the brick walls and silver accents of the floor and chairs, the overall ambience is on the darker side.
While customers waited for their pizzas during the grand opening, the wait staff was attentive, checking up on each table to bring water or drinks. Rance’s expected customers to have a 45-minute wait time, but as the day wore on, the wait stretched to an hour, even an hour and a half in some cases. Though this was expected given the nature of their freshly made pizzas and the sudden influx of orders, it likely won’t be an issue as the restaurant establishes it’s footing within University Park.
Appetizers include five types of salad ranging from $5-8, bruschetta, artichoke dip, garlic cheese sticks, meatballs and an appetizer pizza. 
Rance’s offers three styles of pizza — pan pizza, stuffed and tavern. The pan pizza is the closest to the classic Chicago deep dish pizza, with their website boasting “buttery, flaky deliciousness with a bit of caramelized cheese around the edges.” Rather than a smooth tomato sauce, Rance’s opts for a chunkier sauce, reminiscent of another topping.
The stuffed style pizza uses the same chunky tomato sauce, but features an additional layer of dough on top to seal in all the ingredients. Similar to a flatbread, the tavern-style pizza is thin and square cut, with a smooth marinara sauce. 
A 9-inch diameter personal pizza is $18.95, and it is big enough for two to share. Their largest pizza is 14 inches in diameter, and is $30.95. However, for patrons who want to build their own pizzas, the prices are a bit lower, ranging from $14-23.
Their deep dish crust used in the pan pizza is light and flaky, more of a pastry than a classic pizza crust. This can be a bit unwieldy, especially when the toppings are heavy and the crust is too weak to support it. The thick mozzarella also releases a lot of oil, so the crust has to work doubly hard when it is soaked and weakened. 
Despite the shortcomings of the crust, the toppings Rance’s offers are a good mix of classic pizzas and entirely unique ones. From classic barbecue chicken to the more inventive Mediterranean-style pizza, Rance’s has an option for any mood or craving. One of the more unexpected combinations for a deep dish pizza is Rance’s Spicy Hawaiian pizza. It is a study in contrasts — loaded with pineapple and jalapeños, the slow moving spiciness of the jalapeños is mildly counteracted by the sweet pineapple.
Overall, USC Village’s new pizzeria is overpriced, but it does offer a fresh take on deep dish pizza with its original topping combinations and chunky tomato sauce. It’s worth it for a longer meal with someone with which you want to stop and chat.

Kenan Draughorne | Daily Trojan
With every aspiring teenage artist who breaks through the noise with a chart-topping hit comes a reminder that hip-hop is a young person’s game, a truth that has proven historically true. It’s relatively rare that you see a newcomer over the age of 30 arrive on the hip-hop scene, and even for those who have been active for years, questions of identity crises and growing out of touch can at times be far too common.
Eminem experienced this shift first-hand soon after the release of his latest album Revival, which was panned for its bland attempts at shock value and raised questions about the rapper’s abilities given his age. Before Shawn Carter gave us the wisest album of his career in the form of the landmark 4:44, even Young Thug called Jay-Z “too old” to be rapping, citing a disconnect between his music and the younger generation. 
That doesn’t mean it’s impossible for more seasoned artists to play a role in shaping the landscape, however — in fact, many have found success by embracing rather than resisting their seniority. The veteran MC Phonte is among the best in that category, with mature bars that contain life advice for those in need, and his latest album No News is Good News is no exception. 
Phonte keeps it short and sweet on the 33-minute project, touching on a range of topics while also taking an introspective look at himself. Much of the heaviest content comes in the stretch between “Expensive Genes” and “Cry No More,” as the 39-year-old rapper addresses health issues in the black community and how this has directly affected his own life. Opening the former song with a distorted sound clip of a routine doctor’s office check-up, Phonte proceeds to term blackness as “the most expensive gene of all,” as his fears have shifted from the trials of life in the inner-city to that of his own body breaking down from the inside.
“I wish that I could fit in these expensive genes / A waistline that’ll rip the seams,” he expresses in the song, describing how unhealthy eating habits over the years have taken a toll on him. On “Cry No More,” he details how some of these concerns stem from the death of his father, rapping, “Put my pops in the ground / And hit the repass and ate the same sh-t that killed him.” 
Effren Villanueva | Daily Trojan
There are a variety of reasons why health issues affect African Americans at an elevated rate, especially later in life, including family history, poor eating and disproportionate access to quality care. However, the subject often goes unaddressed in the overall discussion of the state of black America, and is especially absent in hip-hop. Even with more conscious artists such as Kendrick Lamar, Big K.R.I.T. and Joey Bada$$, health is rarely the center of their messages, as the equally important questions of police brutality and institutionalized racism often come to the forefront. 
It’s a message that needs to be heard, though, and the direct impact that poor health patterns have had on Phonte’s life makes it that much more rational that he is the one to tell it. The North Carolina-based MC has always had a poignant pen when it comes to social issues, but health-related lyrics are relatively recent, likely a product of his own aging and a shift in his personal priorities. 
Rapping one’s truth is arguably the most important aspect of a successful career, a relevant fact no matter their age and status. For those who have more experience than many burgeoning artists have years on earth, though, it’s especially imperative, as their unique perspective can extend the conversation in a way that others are unable to. Don’t write off an artist just because they aren’t part of your own age demographic; they just might be saying the things you’ll wish you’d paid attention to when you reach their point in life.
Why I’m smiling: Rae Sremmurd release three singles ahead of SR3MM
SR3MM season is officially upon us, and it’s shaping up to be one of the most anticipated projects of the year. The brothers of Rae Sremmurd kicked off March by releasing a trio of singles off the triple disc album, in Swae Lee’s “Hurt to Look,” Slim Jxmmi’s “Brxnks Truck” and their combined effort “Powerglide” featuring Juicy J. By dedicating a solo disc to each member while releasing the third as a duo, SRE3MM is the perfect way to maximize earning potential in the streaming age without overloading the project with filler material, and instead highlight their individual talents while simultaneously allowing the duo to continue to create music together. So long as they don’t try to cram over 20 songs onto each side, it should make for a well-rounded album when it finally arrives.
Why I’m shaking my head: Rick Ross hospitalized in Miami
Maybach Music Group mogul Rick Ross was rushed to the hospital on Friday after being found unconscious in his home, fueling rumors of a heart attack that had placed the rapper on life support. His status is yet to be confirmed, as several close to Ross have disputed the original TMZ report that he had been hooked up to the machine, but the hip-hop ecosystem has since come out in full force to show their support as the situation continues to unfold. After suffering two seizures in 2011, Rozay has made visible strides to get his health issues under control, shedding over 75 pounds in the process; hopefully he’ll be able to recover from the setback and return to full form before long. 
Why I’m hopeful for the future: SXSW 2018
The annual meeting of the minds in the film, music and interactive industries will be taking place over the course of spring break, and the Daily Trojan will be on location the entire week to bring you the news as it happens. Expect to see plenty of event recaps, artist interviews and other exciting content in our live blog coverage, which will be going live next Monday.
Kenan Draughorne is a junior majoring in journalism. He is also the lifestyle editor of the Daily Trojan. His column, “To Pen a Butterfly,” runs Mondays.

Surrounded by colorful balloon murals and booths adorned with sunglasses, roses and snacks on McCarthy Quad, students waited in anticipation for the speakers of the inaugural “INSPIRE: Arts & Music and Beauty” festival, which took place Thursday and Friday. 
Singer-songwriter Halsey spoke Friday night about what inspires her and how she realized her individuality, as part of the “INSPIRE: Arts & Music and Beauty” festival. Sarah Kim | Daily Trojan
Hosted by the USC Special Events Committee, USC Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment and USC Performing Arts Committee, this event celebrated “self-love, courage, creativity, passion and individuality,” as stated on its Facebook event page. 
This year’s theme stemmed from the Shampoo Movement, a campaign centered on individuality and inspiration.
“A Shampoo Queen is a person who inspires the people they’re around,” said Ines Ramirez, a freshman majoring in industrial and systems engineering. “Just someone very selfless and caring and definitely someone who has a very strong sense of individuality which is what the whole Shampoo Movement is about.”
Ramirez was one of the Shampoo Ambassadors who presented Friday night’s special guests, singer Halsey and former USC student and actress Sophia Bush, who both spoke about what inspires them and finding their individuality. 
Cheryl Koh, a senior majoring in business administration, was a student performer for Thursday night’s event, presenting her own renditions of Bruno Mars’ “Versace on the Floor” and Justin Timberlake’s “Suit and Tie.” 
Born and raised in Malaysia, Koh moved to Los Angeles to pursue her dreams of being a singer. She transferred to USC in Fall 2015 and performs under her stage name “Cheryl K.”
“This is my last semester here, I’m graduating in May,” Koh said. “So any performances on campus, I think it’s very inspiring to be able to be a part of it and be able to share my talent and my singing and to tell my story through music.”
Rainy weather threatened the second night of the event, but the organizers supplied attendees with 300 free umbrellas. At the event, sponsors such as Wicked Hippies, MAC and Girlactik also provided product samples, accessories and complimentary makeovers. 
Special guests for the second night were models Emily Ratajkowski and Irina Shayk, who were introduced by that night’s Shampoo Ambassadors, Danielle Kaiser, a sophomore majoring in public policy, and Lexi Maggelet, a sophomore majoring in gerontology. 
Jill Kickul, professor of clinical entrepreneurship and research director at the USC Marshall School of Business’ Lloyd Greif Center, led the interviews with the celebrity guests.
“[INSPIRE] is all about the individuality and keeping it real, keeping it authentic and inspiring the next generation of social change leaders,” Kickul said.
Ratajkowski answered questions regarding her acting and modeling career, as well as her take on the #MeToo movement and the gender wage gap, particularly in Hollywood.
“I think something that you guys here are all about, this award and this group, is all about is inner confidence and self-belief,” Ratajkowski said.

After studying social media culture throughout his career, computer science professor Len Adleman will be releasing “Memes, Genes, and Cenes,” a book that explores memes in popular culture, in late 2018. 
Viterbi computer science professor Len Adleman’s new book will explore memes and their role in popular culture and media. Photo from Viterbi website.
In his book, Adleman argues that memes are alive and behave in similar ways to biological beings, experiencing the same reproduction and extinction. Adleman says that they struggle to survive and evolve in a Darwinian fashion.
“Memes are a generalization of genes, and, among other things, they include your beliefs,” Adleman wrote in the introduction of an early excerpt of his book. “After studying memes for many decades, I have come to think that they are as indispensable to our understanding of human phenomena as genes are to our understanding of biological ones.”
In 1977, Adleman co-created the RSA cryptography system, which is widely used for public-key encryption and security of sensitive data, like credit card numbers, with cryptographers Ron Rivest and Adi Shamir. 
Adleman and his partners received the A. M. Turing Award in 2002 for this project, which is often regarded as the “Nobel Prize of computing,” according to the Association of Computing Machinery. Adelman’s system is used in almost all Internet-based transactions and has become a staple for e-commerce in the virtual world. 
Most recently, Adleman, Rivest and Shami were named inductees this year in the National Inventor’s Hall of Fame. The 46th annual induction ceremony will be held at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C. in May.
Adleman told Viterbi News that he has no plans to retire, and the almost 70,000 hours of research that he has accumulated for “Memes, Genes, and Cenes” is proof of this.
“The next time you run for president, fight a war or just deal with the ordinary problems that humans are heir to, perhaps the meme-centric perspective will be of use,” Adleman wrote in his book. “If you want to understand why you will die, or if you need guidance on achieving greatness, memes may help here as well.”

The USC Trojans went 1-2 in this weekend’s series against the No. 5 Arkansas Razorbacks at Baum Stadium, taking the Trojans record to 8-3 on the season.

The Razorbacks ended the Trojans’ seven-game winning streak in game one of this weekend’s series. The Trojans lost to the Razorbacks by a score of 4-0; however, the game was closer than the score suggested.
Star junior pitcher Blaine Knight pitched for the Razorbacks in game one against USC sophomore pitcher Chris Clarke. The Trojans managed to get seven hits off of Knight, who has a 0.53 ERA after three starts, however they were unable to score despite leaving eight runners on base throughout the game. 
The Razorbacks gained all the momentum in the first inning thanks to a 2-run homerun from senior outfielder Luke Bonfield. While the Razorbacks only had one more hit than the Trojans throughout the game, eight, they were able to score runners in scoring positions which helped them see off the game.
Game two, however, saw the Trojans go back to their winning ways as they beat No. 5 Arkansas 3-1 on Saturday. USC junior pitcher Quentin Longrie pitched 7.1 strong innings allowing only one run with four strikeouts to help lead the Trojans to victory.
Game two was a real team display from the Trojans as two of the runs scored were scored from sacrifice RBI’s. Unlike on Friday, the Trojans were able to score runners in scoring positions to close out game two. The scoring started late, as sophomore center-fielder Matthew Acosta singled in the top of the sixth to score junior shortstop Chase Bushor for the Trojans first run. Then, in the seventh, sophomore outfielder Brady Shockey hit a sacrifice fly to the outfield with junior second baseman Brandon Perez on third, scoring in the second run for the Trojans. 
In the bottom of the eighth inning, however, junior outfielder Eric Cole blasted a solo shot into left to score for the Razorbacks keeping the game close at 2-1. However, in the ninth, the Trojans scored one more run courtesy of a sacrifice bunt from Perez scoring Acosta and leading the Trojans to an upset 3-1 victory at Baum Stadium.
“Quentin pitched a great game,” said head coach Dan Hubbs to USC Athletics. “That’s all you can ask of your starter. […] Overall this was a big win for a young team that’s still learning how to win.”
Sunday’s rubber-match ended in a heartbreaker for the Trojans as they lost 7-6 on a walk-off single with bases loaded in what was a competitive game. The game had to be cut short to eight innings of play due to the Trojans’ travel arrangements, and unfortunately for the Trojans, the game was lost in the final inning of play.
Freshman pitcher Kyle Hurt took the mound for the Trojans on Sunday and was in control of the game. He threw for 4.2 innings allowing only one earned run on three hits and five strikeouts. Meanwhile, the Trojans also looked great on the offensive side as they had 10 hits through eight innings of play. However, the Trojans were unable to close the game for the first time this season which resulted in a disappointing loss.
The Razorbacks took an early one-run lead in the second, however, the lead didn’t last long as the Trojans scored a run in the fourth to tie the game up at 1-1 through four innings of play. The Trojans then had a big fifth inning as they managed to put 4 more runs on the board and take the lead. However, in the sixth, the Razorbacks fought back and scored four runs of their own to tie the game up at 5 runs apiece.
Despite giving away the lead in the sixth, the Trojans did not put their heads down. In the seventh, sophomore catcher Blake Sabol hit an RBI single to retake the lead 6-5, giving the Trojans all of the momentum. The Trojans then went scoreless in the eighth after shutting out the Razorbacks in the seventh to go into the bottom of the eighth inning with a one-run lead and star sophomore closer Connor Lunn on the mound.
Having not given up a run all season, it looked like a foregone conclusion that the Trojans would walk away from Arkansas with two victories when Lunn went to pitch. However, the Razorbacks showed composure and managed to score 2 runs in the final inning of play to steal game three from the Trojans.
Despite losing two out of three games this weekend, the Trojans managed to keep every game relatively close against a great opponent in Arkansas.
Next weekend, the Trojans will face off against three more ranked opponents in the Dodger Stadium College Baseball Classic.

In a rivalry game against UCLA, the stakes were high for the Trojans. Three-year captain Jordan McLaughlin, USC’s all-time leader in minutes played, and forward Elijah Stewart, USC’s all-time leader in 3-point field goals, were playing their last games ever at the Galen Center. The same was probably true for junior forward Chimezie Metu, a top prospect in the NBA Draft. The three of them have helped USC transition from worst in the Pac-12 three years ago to second in the conference this year. Along the way, they have shared two NCAA Tournament wins and two Tournament berths.

However, Saturday night’s game did not go their way. Although the Trojans (21-10, 12-6) took a double-digit lead in the first half, they immediately allowed the Bruins (20-10, 11-7) an 11-0 run. USC would regain a 3-point lead at halftime, 43-40. Yet, their final lead slipped away with 10 minutes to play in the game. Ultimately, the Bruins won 83-72, spoiling Senior Night and, perhaps, USC’s shot at a third consecutive NCAA Tournament win.
“We got outplayed for 10 minutes and that’s it,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “UCLA made shot after shot. We had trouble stopping them.”
In fact, a pair of Bruins flashed career nights: guard Aaron Holiday and small forward Kris Wilkes. Holiday, who led the Pac-12 in scoring this season, scored 34, converting on 6-of-9 3-point shots. In addition, guard Kris Wilkes, one of the top freshmen in the conference, scored 22 points.
McLaughlin commended Holiday’s performance. Either of them could be named the top point guard in the conference or the nation.
On Saturday, McLaughlin had an unusual but very good performance. Normally a pass-first player, McLaughlin shot the ball a season high 19 times. He scored 19 points and tallied four assists, more than three short of his season average.
This year’s home finale had several highlights for the Trojans. In the first half, the Trojans slammed home three dunks in a span of two minutes. McLaughlin connected with Metu on an alley-oop thrown from beyond half court.
Then, Stewart and redshirt junior Shaqquan Aaron each made a dunk of their own. Slam City, a label these upperclassmen have built for the program over the past few seasons, was on full display throughout their final home game. 
“Tonight was a rollercoaster of emotions,” Stewart said. He tried to stay mellow during the pregame festivities, but he could not help but feel excited once USC took a 10-point lead. 
The game was also exhausting for him. 
“Nowhere in the game did we think we were gonna lose, so we just kept playing as hard as we could until the time expired,” Stewart said.
USC will have to bounce back on Thursday night when they play their first game in the Pac-12 Tournament. Or else, they will not get an NCAA Tournament bid. After tonight’s game, ESPN has UCLA listed as one of the last four teams in the Tournament while USC is one of the last four teams out.
Enfield is worried about winning, not prognosticating. 
“We are not even concerned about the NCAA tournament,” he said. “We just want to play the best basketball we can in Las Vegas.”
It was a bittersweet season for the Trojans. Although they finished second in the conference, they failed to meet preseason expectations. They were swept by UCLA, lost to Princeton at home and lost rematches against Texas A&M and SMU, two teams they beat last year. 
Overall, they assembled a resume that puts them on the border of an NCAA berth. Of course, winning the Pac-12 Tournament will guarantee a bid. Two wins, which equals a trip to the conference championship, should be enough. One win or none and the Trojans might not be invited to the Big Dance. 
“Everyone has to strap up their shoes and play their best,” Stewart said. 
Any less than their best, and the Trojans’ postseason aspirations will come to an end in Las Vegas.

Sam Arslanian | Daily Trojan
Many fans, including myself, had low expectations for the USC baseball team entering the 2018 season. Coming off a 21-34 2017 season and a relatively young roster, there wasn’t much that made the Trojans look like a dominant team on paper.
They opened the season with a loss to Utah Valley, a team I had never heard of, and I thought to myself, “Oh, boy, this could be a rough season.” To my surprise I was proven wrong almost instantly as the Trojans won their next seven games, topping the likes of Long Beach State and LMU and sweeping the three-game series over Villanova.
Suddenly there seemed to be a glimmer of hope for this Trojan team. I tried to ground myself and realize that the aforementioned teams were not particularly strong lineups.
This past weekend, the Men of Troy traveled to Fayetteville, Ark. to face off against the No. 5 Razorbacks in a three-game series. This was the Trojans’ first true test of the season. They dropped the first game by a score of 0-4 and then bounced back with a 3-1 win the next day.
The team that was projected to have a very average season upset the number five seed. I investigated to find the key to the Trojans’ recent success. One word: defense.
With a fielding percentage of .997, USC has the best fielding percentage in the NCAA. They have made just one error this season, so far an astounding accomplishment.
Looking deeper into the Trojans’ 3-1 Saturday win over the Razorbacks, the importance of defense becomes blatantly evident. USC did not have a multi-hit batter and only recorded five hits compared to Arkansas’ nine. Moreover, the Men of Troy stranded nine Razorbacks on base.
A lot of people will look at this and assume that Arkansas should have found ways to score those runs. On the other hand, I look at the outcome as a testament of the Trojans’ strong defense.
USC didn’t have a strong game at the plate as the dominant Arkansas rotation wouldn’t allow that, but the Trojans found a way to limit the Hogs’ offense and put up the few runs they needed to win the ball game.
Prior to the series, head coach Dan Hubbs commented on how defense has been a focus and strong point for the Trojans.
“The defense has been fantastic,” Hubbs said. “They make the routine play. They made balls on the run, balls in the hole, we’re not killing ourselves with stupid mistakes. And that’s what we’re going to have to do. This team is going to be built on pitching and defense and our bullpen and then getting the timely hit. I think we’ve been successful at doing that for the first couple of weeks.”
I’ve played baseball for as long as I can remember. Although, I have never played at the college level, I played federation ball with the same team for almost a decade. Through those nine years, I learned a lot about the game of baseball and my team. The most important thing I learned was to understand my team. Our team seldom had big bats. Most of our wins were by a few runs, resembling score lines of 2-1 and 1-0. 
The average spectator and a lot of coaches would see this as a problem. Alternatively, we recognized who we were as a team and emphasized our defense. We knew we weren’t going to beat our opposition with our bats. We had to do it with pitching and defense. We very rarely made errors and because of that, we were able to strand a significant amount of runners and limit big innings.
In my opinion, that’s what the Trojans need to do. They need to recognize the composition and skill sets of their roster. In 2018, they have posted a team batting average of .263, but nonetheless this team is winning games. For now, they need to understand that maybe they won’t put up 5 or 6 runs in a game and that defense is key for this team. Ideally, at some point in the season their bats will come alive, and when they do the Men of Troy will be dangerous.
