Samuel Deutsch, a junior majoring in political economy, has become the first Trojan to win the Jeopardy! College Championship since the tournament began in 1988.
Deutsch competed against Sarah Dubnik and Niki Peters, students at the University of Pittsburgh and UC Berkeley respectively, in the final round Friday.
The show, which is an offshoot of the regular Jeopardy! game show that has been on air since 1964, brings together full-time undergraduate college students from around the country, who have to face a series of challenging rounds of trivia before competing in the finals.
“It was really cool meeting students from all over the U.S. who were not only incredibly smart but funny and interesting as well,” Deutsch said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Though we were competing against each other, at the end of the day I think we felt more like teammates than competitors; the producers did a great job at helping everyone loosen up and be friendly.”
The Jeopardy! College Championship has hundreds of in-person auditions, and only a select few make the final cut.
“I was kind of shocked. Finding out that I was one of the lucky 15 was surreal,” Deutsch said.
Going over history and geography, playing Sporcle (an online trivia game), watching old episodes and using a pen as a mock buzzer helped Deutsch prepare for the show and claim the grand prize of $100,000.
But Deutsch felt that he couldn’t prepare for being quizzed by Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek, one of television’s most recognizable figures, despite having practice rounds beforehand.
“I felt like a deer in the headlights, to be honest. The lights were bright,” Deutsch said. “I felt lucky to be even on the show and didn’t think about whether I could win.”
Deutsch subsequently qualifies for a place in the Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions.
Deutsch, who grew up in Bethesda, Maryland, was especially thankful that his friends and family were there to support him at the taping.
“The best moment had to be hearing my family and friends cheering me on. Since the show tapes in Culver City, a bunch of my friends were able to make it to the taping and root for me,” Deutsch said.
Deutsch noted how the interdisciplinary nature of his major helped him succeed.
“I like taking economics classes of course, and the political economy major allowed me to combine that with a bunch of fascinating international relations courses as well, and that unique combination of perspectives has helped me synthesize and build on what I learn,” Deutsch said.
Apart from being a political economy major, Deutsch’s versatility and love for music led him to DJing with his roommate Max.
“I’m into all sorts of stuff from hip-hop to indie to electronic, and L.A. is great because I’m able to go to concerts all the time here. Max and I enjoy doing parties on the Row and clubs in Hollywood,” he said.
His drive for constant learning is making him consider going to law school after graduation. His business law classes have also played a role in this decision.
Deutsch plans to invest a part of the prize money and use it in the future to help pay for law school. He is also willing to set aside some of it to go to Tokyo for a post-graduation trip. Deutsch is a travel enthusiast currently studying abroad in the Netherlands and hopes to find work that allows him to travel.
“I also plan on donating some of my winnings to the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research at Georgetown University,” Deutsch said. “I chose this charity, as it is one I have a personal connection to. My mom is a survivor and a huge inspiration. Every year she has run in fundraisers for breast cancer research, and I look forward to supporting her this year.”

Keynote Speaker of the M{2e} program and Global Head of YouTube Spaces, Lance Podell, discussed how YouTube is exponentially growing through his panel, “Four Reasons Why Digital Video Will Win the Decade” in Wallis Annenberg Hall Thursday at noon. The discussion was presented by Clinical Professor of Communication, Christopher Smith.
The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism’s M{2e}’s events, from Feb. 8-12, focused on media, economics and entrepreneurship to inform students about the importance of digital video.
Gabriel Kahn, professor of professional practice of journalism, and Smith organized this week’s events.
“It has been incredible, and it has really sparked a lot of productive work that we look forward to continuing,” Smith said.
YouTube’s business model changed the industry of digital video, Smith said. He also explained why YouTube speakers were noteworthy to USC’s student body.
“YouTube is right there, with all of the business models that are being experimented with. YouTube transformed what it means to be an influencer, what it means to be a celebrity,” Smith said.
The panel opened with Podell  welcoming attendants and encouraging them to be a part of the currently changing media industry.
“All of you are really at the front line of this massive shift,” Podell said. “There is a real need. There is a lot of opportunity for people who can think creatively with a business mind.”
Podell discussed how the mobility of media is helping digital video grow exponentially.
“The youngest millennials are already watching more digital video than television,” Podell said.
Bigger screens, better video clarity and better sound on “phablets” (phone and tablet combination) have revolutionized the industry.
“Digital video is inherently mobile and YouTube is a major driver of this shift,” Podell said.
This diversification has created a large following, especially from millennials. Anyone can make an impact, according to Podell.
“One billion views used to be an outlier,” Podell said. “TV cannot touch one billion views.”
Podell described the new digital experience in the panel.
“Digital video is immersive. It will grow even faster because it can create a much more immersive and interactive experience than TV,” Podell said.
Technologies, like Google Cardboard, a virtual reality headset, have made this immersive experience available to everyone.
“You will have big voices. Please use them. We really think it will make a difference,” Podell said.
Annenberg professors are excited about upcoming opportunities that partnerships, especially with companies such as YouTube can mean for students.
“YouTube cuts across just about every facet of the media landscape,” Kahn said. “So, for our students to get a chance to interact with them on all these different fronts has been like having a peek into the future.”
Students heard from many YouTube executives this week and enjoyed the opportunity.
“I really liked the discussion of the business behind YouTube as a company,” freshman communication major Dani Otter said. “It’s really interesting because it’s a rare situation in which the individual creators have full control over their content yet heavily rely on YouTube as the platform to share and connect with their audience.”
Through Annenberg’s {M2e} program, students are participating in real projects, especially through its partnership with Marshall’s Entrepreneurial Lloyd Greif Center.
“M{2e} is officially on the map of the Annenberg experience,” Smith said. “It is really exciting where we are going to take that in the coming year.”

Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
President C. L. Max Nikias delivered his annual State of the University address on Wednesday at Town and Gown.
Nikias mainly focused on issues of diversity, according to USC News, in the wake of recent events happening at USC as well as across the country.
“We know that when members of our Trojan Family stand up and speak out, we must lend our ears and listen,” Nikias said, according to USC News. “Because when we listen to each other, we learn from each other, and we understand each other in a deeper and more meaningful way.”
Nikias commended the creation of the Provost’s Diversity Task Force, and encouraged other faculties members to help create a public discourse.
“We’re developing a deeper dialogue with each of our schools, asking you to offer your ideas and your input to increase faculty diversity,” Nikias said.
But Nikias also stressed how important it was to discuss these issues at a national level rather than restrict discussions of diversity to college campuses.
“Despite all the talk about diversity in American higher education, nobody talks at the national level about the real crisis we face as a nation,” Nikias said.
Nikias specifically focused on the youth and how, despite current USC programs such as the Neighborhood Academic Initiative, public schools and K-12 education needed to do a better job preparing their students for college.
“If we are going to create more diversity in American higher education among our student body, our Ph.D. students, our postdoctoral scholars and our faculty, eventually we must pay attention to the pipeline,” Nikias said. “If we don’t do that, we have no chance.”

The No. 23 ranked Trojans are back on the road for a brief two-game stint against the Arizona State Sun Devils on Friday and the No. 17 Arizona Wildcats on Sunday.
Head coach Andy Enfield emphasized a balanced offensive attack and the importance of bench depth.
“Some of the players that aren’t playing a lot or don’t have that many minutes or don’t play at all are good basketball players. It’s just that the first seven or eight are really good right now; they’re playing at a high level,” Enfield said. “It is nice to have depth off the bench … It doesn’t matter who we have on the court; we can score at every position.”
As it stands, the Men of Troy have six players averaging in double figures, with five players averaging 12.2 points or more after a total of six players scored nine or more against the Bruins.
The Men of Troy have been shooting the ball with precision from beyond the arc this season, ranking 27th best in the nation, completing 38.8 percent of their shots from downtown including 40 percent against UCLA.
Arizona State (13-11) is quite familiar with the three ball as well, completing 190 of their 564 shots this season, ranking first in the Pac-12 in 3-point attempts and third-worst in 3-point percentage.
Their biggest long-ball shooter is sophomore Tra Holder, who makes 40 percent of his 3-point attempts and averages 15.5 points per game.
Overall, however, the Sun Devils have experienced adversity this season losing against Sacramento State, Cal and Stanford, while ranking in the bottom four in the Pac-12 in scoring margin, overall field-goal percentage and assists.
Arizona State’s biggest wins on the year have been against Texas A&M, Oregon State and Belmont, teams with a combined 50-22 record.
Freshman forward Bennie Boatwright commented on the strength of this Sun Devils squad and how well USC has been doing as of late.
“They’re very physical, and they shoot a lot of threes, so we have to close out on them and try to deter them a bit. Coach emphasizes defense, defense, defense,” Boatwright said. “Everybody’s been stepping up because we have a lot of weapons.”
Earlier in the season, the Trojans beat the Sun Devils at home, defeating ASU 75-65 in a true team effort that saw eight Trojans score 5 or more points including Julian Jacobs and Bennie Boatwright combining for 29.
In the game, USC went 7-for-16 from beyond the arc and 27-for-55 from the field while limiting Arizona State to just 7-for-25 and 26-for-68, respectively.
With a 7-3 conference record, the Trojans have an opportunity to gain a half a game on Oregon’s Pac-12 lead. Meanwhile, the Sun Devils hold the second-worst conference record in the league, holding a 3-8 record.
Boatwright said the Men of Troy have a renewed confidence and focus in practice.
“Our confidence is really high; we’ve been focussing on the game plan each and every day … We expect to go out there and play hard. That’s what we do. We’re not really focussed on the rankings right now; we’re just focused on getting better,” Boatwright said.
The 18-5 Trojans are set to take on the 13-11 Sun Devils at Wells Fargo Arena in Tempe at 5 p.m. Friday.

After four games on the road, this is the Women of Troy’s first weekend at home. They will start the weekend with a rematch against Washington, and on Sunday, they will finish out their weekend with a rematch against Washington State. Both Washington teams defeated USC by a margin of 12 points or fewer earlier in the season. Those victories came immediately after the turmoil of losing junior Jordan Adams and senior Brianna Barrett, two starters sidelined for eligibility issues.
Although both of the previous Washington games resulted in losses, associate head coach Beth Burns said that those losses were more of factor in the loss of Adams and Barrett. Their focus this weekend will be less on their opponents — which include Washington’s Kelsey Plum, the nation’s second highest scorer — and more on improving their own offensive game.
“The last time we played these teams, it was eight games ago,” Burns said. “This is a completely different team taking the court this weekend.”
The Women of Troy are coming off of a split weekend in Arizona. They started their weekend with a solid 67-57 victory over Arizona, improving to 17-7 on their season. On Sunday, the team played it close with No. 8 Arizona State right until the buzzer. The Sun Devils squeaked by with a 69-68 win.
Though the game against Arizona State is a loss on paper, both games served as a massive confidence boost for a team still searching for a rhythm midseason. Junior Courtney Jaco has risen as an offensive leader, notching 24 points — including four 3-pointers — in last Friday’s comeback win against Arizona. Her role has changed the most this season, as she left behind her role as an outside shooter to become the team’s point guard.
“Last weekend gave us the most confidence, and I think you can see that by how we played,” Jaco said. “Before, we weren’t getting our offense going; we weren’t hitting our outside shots, and that was all in our heads. It was a confidence thing. I think as we’re getting our confidence up, we’re seeing that we can really hang in there with anyone.”
Down low, sophomore Kristen Simon and transfer graduate Temi Fagbenle have become solid anchors for the team, with both forwards putting up double digits in at least one of the two games last weekend. Fagbenle said that one of the team’s greatest struggles has been endurance and keeping players healthy and eligible to suit up for each game.
“We have to stick together and stay focused because when you’re tired, it’s easy to lose that focus,” Fagbenle said. “It’s not easy. It’s certainly not making it easier on us, but it’s something that we can overcome when we stick together as a team. I think, at this point, we are very capable of challenging these supposed superior teams.”
Friday’s game against Washington will also be the program’s annual “Pink Game.” To raise awareness for breast cancer, the team will wear pink and is encouraging fans to do the same. To further raise funds for breast cancer, USC is asking fans to donate to the Kay Yow Foundation online. The foundation, inspired by legendary North Carolina State women’s basketball coach Kay Yow, is officially backed by the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association.
For the USC program, the foundation hits close to home. Burns was an assistant coach under Yow at North Carolina State, and head coach Cynthia Cooper won a gold medal in the 1988 Seoul Olympics with Yow as her coach. Now, Cooper is the Pac-12 coordinator for the foundation, and her goal for this year is to raise $2,500 from USC and $25,000 from the division as a whole.
“When [Low] had Stage Four breast cancer, she said that this was something that she wouldn’t beat it in her lifetime, but it is something that we can beat in the next,” Burns said. “This is one of the most important causes we can partner with, and we have a lot of faith in this foundation and in our ability to raise the money we need.”

Big opportunities don’t come around too often.
Three weeks ago, the men’s basketball team, fresh off its first appearance in the AP Top 25 since 2008, headed to Oregon for weekend road contests against the Ducks and Beavers with a chance to solidify or even improve upon a robust No. 21 ranking.
Instead, the Trojans fell flat, losing to both teams and dropping out of the rankings as quickly as they entered them.
“We worked so hard to be a really good basketball team and to get the recognition that we deserve,” redshirt junior guard Katin Reinhardt said to the Los Angeles Daily News last month. “We saw that ranking and then we lost it.”
Now, after sweeping a three-game homestand with strong wins over Washington State, Washington and UCLA, the Men of Troy find themselves back in the rankings and in a similar position as they were in mid-January.
Ranked 23rd in the nation in both the AP Top 25 and USA Today Coaches Poll, the Trojans once again will hit the road for a couple of games over the weekend, this time against Arizona State and No. 17 Arizona.
Adding to the parallelism, the quality of the opponents is alike.
Arizona State is a lot like Oregon State — a team that, on paper, the Trojans should beat. Arizona is comparable to Oregon as the more established ranked team against whom a road loss would be understandable, but the Trojans should be able to hang with.
USC has already beaten both the Sun Devils and Wildcats at home on Jan. 7 and 9, a weekend capped off by the classic four-overtime win over then seventh-ranked Arizona that turned a lot of heads around college basketball.
All they’re looking for this weekend is a repeat formula, except on the road. Here lies another massive opportunity not only for head coach Andy Enfield and the Men of Troy in their quest to become not just relevant but also to remain in the conversation as legitimate Pac-12 contenders.
Because let’s be honest: nobody expected the Trojans to even sniff the rankings this season, much less be points behind perennial powerhouse Kentucky this deep into the campaign. The Trojans are even one spot ahead of Texas, which was one Buddy Hield spectacular buzzer-beater away from upsetting No. 3 Oklahoma on Monday. If USC were to play the Sooners today, the result would probably not be very pretty.
But the thing about an up-and-coming team is that nobody — not even themselves — knows their true potential, and that should be very scary for any of the NCAA’s top dogs should the Trojans make it to March Madness.
Speaking of which, the Trojans are picked to enter the NCAA Tournament as high as a No. 4 seed in the Midwest bracket in USA Today’s latest bracketology predictions updated on Thursday, while Duke and Arizona are both projected to be sixth seeds — a development that would not have even been plausible prior to the season.
First, though, the Men of Troy must take care of business in their remaining eight conference games. Enfield has continuously stressed that his team should stay in the moment.
“Now we’re ranked again, and we’re on the road again, so we will see if we have learned anything from last time,” Enfield said, according to The Register Guard. “You can easily lose on the road in this conference whether you’re ranked or not, whether you’re overconfident or not because the road is so hard in this league.”
Multiple appearances in the rankings are yet another indication that the Trojans are moving rapidly in the right direction. This weekend presents a chance for the Men of Troy to take it a step further and stay in the Top 25 for consecutive weeks, stay ahead of Arizona and move closer to overtaking Oregon atop the Pac-12 and keep building their reputation as an up-and-coming program everybody wants to see come March.
Opportunity is knocking for the Trojans, and they better grasp it before it’s in their rear view mirror.

The men’s volleyball team will look for an upset when they take on No. 1 Long Beach State at the Galen Center Friday night.
This is the team’s second go-around this year. Back in January, Long Beach took down the Trojans 3-1 (20-25, 25-17, 25-21, 25-17).
In the first set, USC (2-9, 2-7) showed they have what it takes to beat the No. 1 team in the nation by hitting .450. However, they would fall in the very next set with a -.033 hitting percentage.
For the match, the Trojans were outhit .377-.191 and out-blocked 14-9.
Playing more consistently is something the Trojans are still working toward.
“After every game we win, somehow we mentally slow it down,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said.
Long Beach State (10-2, 7-2) out-hits, out-serves, out-digs and out-blocks opponents. 6-foot-4 freshman outside hitter T.J. DeFalco leads the team with 183 kills. DeFalco was a two-time OC Register Player of the Year at Huntington Beach High School (2014-2015) and AVCA Boys’ High School Senior All-American last year.
Two outstanding middle blockers anchor the team. Six-foot-7 senior Taylor Gregory, a third-team Volleyball Magazine All-American last year entered the season as Long Beach State’s 9th all-time leading blocker with 427 total blocks. This year, he has already added 35 more blocks, tied for a team high. The co-leader is 6-foot-4 junior Bryce Yould. Combined this year, the two have amassed 70 block assists, 156 kills and a staggering .572 hitting percentage.
USC felt the full brunt force of their dominance in the first matchup this year when Gregory went off for 11 kills on 12 attempts (.917) and five blocks, while Yould added 11 kills on 16 attempts (.625) and six blocks.
In that match, the Trojans were missing their biggest blocking threat 6-foot-9 junior middle blocker Andy Benesh due to an early season back injury.
In Wednesday’s game against Cal State Northridge, a healthy Benesh showed signs of why he was named a preseason second-team All-American. In the span of six plays in the second set, Benesh garnered four blocks. He would finish the night with a match-high six.
“We’ve been focusing a ton on [blocking],” Nygaard said. “I think tonight the light bulb went on and clicked for a couple of players.”
The light bulb seemed to click for junior outside hitter Lucas Yoder who recorded 17 kills on 50 attempts and added four blocks. In contrast to earlier matches, Yoder looked comfortable calling for the ball and running the show on offense.
“[Yoder gave] a great performance.” Nygaard said. “He started getting a ton of kills in rhythm.”
To win on Friday night, the Men of Troy’s offense will have to be multidimensional to get around Long Beach State’s big blockers.
No question, a win over Long Beach State would catalyze the rest of USC’s season.

After 15 years of waiting, Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) and Hansel (Owen Wilson) have returned fashionably late. Zoolander 2 had some decent moments that were unfortunately outweighed by a trying- too-hard-to-be-something-it’s-not feel. The film definitely did its best to captivate viewers just like the first did, but with slow, conventional writing, it proved unsuccessful and lacked a certain authenticity to it. While it didn’t live up to the expectations the first beloved film gave moviegoers, the sequel did have a number of celebrity cameos and funny one-liners that made the film a little more bearable.
The film begins as if it were something out of James Bond movies; speeding motorcycles are seen chasing the person of interest, who in this case is pop superstar Justin Bieber. What better way to start the film than with the assassination of Bieber? Just before he dies, he makes sure to tell his killers, “You can’t kill us all; we will protect the chosen one,” and his life ends — but not before he takes one last selfie. The scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie: humor, melodrama and danger all compiled into a film about the comeback story of two has-been male models.
The year is 2016, over a decade of trends and technology, Zoolander and Hansel have just come out of hiding to re-establish their modeling careers after tragic events ruin them. Immediately, the two are offered a gig in Rome by trending fashion designer Don Atari (Kyle Mooney). A myriad of celebrity cameos are made the night of the big fashion runway show, with appearances by Benedict Cumberbatch, Skrillex and Joe Jonas. Though the famed models make their way down the runway, they are mocked and shamed for their outdated careers in the industry.
After this moment, the plot begins to thicken, and the audience learns through the help of Zoolander’s love interest, Valentina (Penelope Cruz), that his son’s life is in mortal danger. Thus, Zoolander, Hansel and Valentina embark on a mission to rescue Derek Jr., who is chubby, awkward and far from model-esque. At this point, enter more cameos from Neil deGrasse Tyson, Willie Nelson and Sting that make up for poor acting and low-grade jokes.
The film’s antagonist, Mugatu (Will Ferrel), is locked up in a fashion prison, where he is then visited by Zoolander in the hopes of finding out more information about his son. With this return, Mugatu manages to make Zoolander look just as stupid as he did in the first film. Mugatu then escapes from the prison and returns to his evil doings that involve Derek Jr. Zoolander is determined to rescue his flawed son at the “IncrediBall,” where all the top fashion designers will be gathering.
At the IncrediBall, Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and fashion designers Tommy Hilfiger, Marc Jacobs, Alexander Wang, Vera Wang and Valentino Garavani are all thrown together in a bathhouse sporting black, spooky robes.The cult-like setting is led by Mugatu, and the climax unfolds. This scene was definitely the funniest of the entire film. With long overdue revelations and Mugatu sharing his smart sense of humor, the whole audience was left laughing.
Though the film had many cheap moments, it managed to make a full, coherent circle and incorporated profound elements from the first film, almost as if paying reverence, with the theme of “who am I?” asked by both Zoolander and Hansel. At the end of the film, both gain the answer to this existential question.
Overall, the resolution works out for almost everyone, and Zoolander and Hansel make a successful return back on the catwalk. Ultimately, this film was not Stiller’s best work, yet it had a few funny moments that stuck out. With random cameos from Susan Boyle to Katy Perry, it was definitely a star-studded lineup of actors. This film is not meant to be seen during a family outing with young children, and while it’s funny the first time around, it’s not worth seeing again.

Undergraduate Student Government’s International Student Assembly, had their International Food Fair on McCarthy Quad Thursday. ISA is part of the programming branch of USG, entrusted to promote the international student population’s concerns and interests, while providing cultural, educational experiences. The International Food Fair is an annual event that does just that, featuring food vendors from all over Los Angeles, ranging from Russian to Thai, Chinese to Brazilian and much more.
ISA’s food fair began three years ago, originally as a fundraiser where students were asked to bring cans in exchange for free food. However, this was eventually adapted to become the International Food Fair with the goals of showcasing food from all around the world to USC students. ISA’s member organizations, which include different international student organizations on campus, chose 18 different food vendors to be present at the fair that they felt represented the country their members were from, making sure the choices were authentic. In America, many foods from international countries are often adapted from their original recipes to appeal to the generic masses, but ISA wanted to step away from restaurant chains, offering more culturally accurate cuisine.
“It’s more cultural awareness about cuisine from all around the world and how they are different from each other,” ISA Director Gisella Tan said. “It’s not an American interpretation of that food.”
Choices at the fair include Greek food like spanakopita, hummus, tiropita and dolmades. The Burmese food included milk tea, tea leaf salad and tapioca, among other delicacies. Upon arrival to the fair, students were greeted by numerous tables, each boasting a different type of food. They were then ushered to stop by the check in table to sign in, like the ISA Facebook page and receiv two blue tickets. For each ticket, the student could then go to one of the many tables at the food fair and get a scrumptious plate full of food. If students liked ISA on social media, they received an extra ticket for more food samples. On top of that, for students who dressed up in traditional cultural clothing, they were able to receive one more ticket for food. Fast passes to cut the line were also given away via social media contests. AT&T made an appearance at the fair, raffling off 10 iPhones, tablets, Otterboxes and discounted service plans, which is exceptionally important to international students as they require new phones when coming to America.
Standout food at the fair included Taiwanese boba from the popular vendor Ozero, located in Little Tokyo. The milk tea was sweet and refreshing on the scorching 80-degree day, with delicious boba settled at the bottom. Likewise, the Ethiopian food — spicy lentils, split peas and curry potatoes from Azla Vegan — was so delicious that many students wished they had dressed up for an extra ticket. To top it all off was the sweet and flaky baklava from the Israeli table.
Overall, ISA’s International Food Fair was the highlight of the afternoon, taking students around the world for a delicious yet informative lunch.
The Fair is a positive step because being an international student isn’t easy, given our complex culture and language. Assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on life’s journey. A new award-winning worldwide book/ebook that reaches out to help anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they’ve contributed to our society, including students.  
   A chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture, friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work with/for an American firm here or overseas. 
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here. 
   Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow students, and informative books to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.  Good luck to all at SC or wherever you study!

Valentine’s Day is rapidly approaching, which means last-minute jewelry, chocolate and flower sales are most likely through the roof. Passive aggressive comments by boyfriends and girlfriends alike are being tossed across phone lines, and single people are sending “who needs a relationship when you have a …” Snapchats up the wazoo. Whether you’re nursing a broken heart, celebrating your singledom with a girl’s night/bro trip, spicing up an old relationship or honeymooning in a new one, there’s a playlist for you.
Wine connoisseurs could tell you exactly what glass of Pinot to pair with your dinner. Likewise, music connoisseurs could perfectly match a song to your personality. I, however, am neither, but I can combine the two and tell you what music to play during your Valentine’s plans.
While terms like “girl’s night” and “bro trip” may seem to be gendered, I use them only in their contextual sense. What I suggest for each is more-than-welcomed to be used by whichever gender if it fits the type of night they plan on having (if it doesn’t, I’m not going to show up at your place and berate you if you decide to listen to something I didn’t suggest).
It’s girl’s night; a night to be filled with ice cream, rom-coms, dancing about and pampering yourself. Maybe your group is looking for a distraction from loneliness or celebrating your single confidence, you need badass music. There’s the traditional route of Beyoncé, Kelly Clarkson and Miranda Lambert, but punk pop is always an unexplored second. Put on some Tokyo Police Club, some Heartsrevolution and some Does It Offend You, Yeah? for the perfect mood to dance in your underwear with your best friends.
Or maybe you’re more of the bro-y type and your weekend plans consist of a front yard tailgate or an outdoor camping trip. Daytime means it’s time to break out the trip hop — Griz and Big Gigantic will soundtrack you through the beer guzzling and meat consuming day of vague emotional expression. For added fun, throw in some experimental hip hop in with Yung Lean, Death Grips, Milo and Captain Murphy. Then when the sun lowers and it’s time to pitch your tent, it’s also time to switch from beats to zen and rock. Violent Femmes mixed in with Washed Out for an upbeat but soft punk experience interspersed with electropop vibes.
If you and your sweetie have been dating for multiple years, Valentine’s Day may seem more like a routine than a holiday. You’ve got traditional plans of dinner and a movie or a stay-at-home Netflix binge fest. Either way, the right background music can remind both of you why you still let each other through the door. Your night’s recipe is Sufjan Stevens, Passenger, James Bay, Iron + Wine and Father John Misty to create the perfect acoustic soundtrack. You know each other like the Netflix homepage and you don’t need lyrics to speak for you, you need a singer’s emotion to back you.
Lastly comes the situation Hallmark invented Valentine’s Day for brand-new couples ready to make any income dispensable in the name of the color red and anatomically incorrect hearts. The mood should be set by The Belle Brigade, Matt Nathanson, Avalanche City and Alexander. Upbeat indie and pop artists to mimic the never-ending smile that significant other brings to your face.
And for those of you who have no specific plans, I recommend Cage the Elephant’s newest album, “Tell Me I’m Pretty” for the perfect read-as-much-into-it-as-you-want, universal background music.

As high school seniors across the country transition from the college application to the college admissions process, it is more important than ever that USC reflect upon its own admissions practices and recognize that building a world-class university begins with the applicant pool.
The Coalition for Access, Affordability and Success, which formed last year, is a group of more than 90 universities that have pledged to improve the admissions process for students and college affordability. The coalition plans to research and develop a free online platform to level the playing field in college admissions and provide resources to students and parents to better prepare them to apply for college and for the universities to better evaluate candidates.
Out of the top 25 universities named by U.S. News and World Report, a staggering 19 of them are part of the coalition, the only schools absent being Georgetown University, Carnegie Mellon University, UC Berkeley, MIT, UCLA and USC. We need to continue building our University starting from the applicants and moving upward. A university is only as good as its students. Joining this coalition would be the next logical step.
Motives are key. USC should not join the coalition just because Harvard, Yale and Stanford are a part of it; it should join because these are schools that have pledged to put students first by employing the most holistic and fair approach to college admissions, and it ought to do the same. If USC really wants to invest in its future as a top-tier university, then it is time it begins viewing admissions as a process from the applicant’s point of view.
The Coalition is utilizing the most up-to-date research on college admissions to find the most effective ways to evaluate applicants.
For example, the first piece of this research released late last month by the Harvard Graduate School of Education, outlines concrete ways that universities can modify application processes to make them fairer and more accessible. In fact, some of the Coalition schools have already vowed to implement the recommendations cited. These suggestions include restricting the number of community service involvements that an applicant could list, but emphasizing how meaningful each commitment has been, as well as discouraging applicants from enrolling in too many AP courses as a way of demonstrating academic rigor.  The report also calls for schools to take into account familial responsibilities and part-time work that could limit a student’s extracurricular or scholastic involvement. Another aspect of the research is a call to minimize the weight that university admissions places on standardized testing because it can put low-income students at a disadvantage.
With more schools across the country joining the Coalition and committing to be allies of the student in the admissions process, USC should strive to stand at the forefront amidst rapid change. The University has an opportunity to not only show that they are committed to student well-being but also to usher in a new era of college admissions that promotes more than just competition.
Over the course of this past year, the USC administration has been criticized by student leaders for their unwillingness to enforce a tuition freeze, lack of proactivity when it comes to addressing issues of diversity on campus and instances of sexual assault during which they did not act as an advocate for its students.
Thus, it is paramount for the University to decisively show that they are working for the best interest of students, a pact that needs to be made even before students set foot on campus as freshmen. By joining the Coalition and engaging in the research, USC is saying once and for all that they are a university for the students, above all else, and that it strives to be a school based off of the holistic merits of students rather than applicants’ abilities to play the rigged admissions game. USC has a duty to students — both current and future — because an investment in admissions is an investment in a brighter future.

Very nice. Who will pay for all the extra personnel needed to screen the 10X (or whatever) applicants, now that application is free? Oh, no, a computer with the right software will do it. Very nice, again. Take the human element out and install a mechanistic program instead. Bad ideas. USC has many demands on it for expenses, including scholarships to many applicants now. That is the way to spend University funds, not on an army of admissions screeners and readers.

When I asked my classmate if he planned to vote in the U.S. presidential election, he responded with, “The election? There’s no point in voting, especially in California.”
He’s not the only one who thinks so. In a primary, some young voters consider their contribution to be somewhat irrelevant, since there is no partisan competition or historic state-specific party loyalty. But in the general election — in which whole parties tend to win whole states — young voters whose affiliations align with the favored party tend to consider their vote less effective or meaningful. And wrongfully so.
The millennial vote is one of the most highly analyzed and valuable blocs in the country because of its power in numbers and impressionability. And yet, millennial issues are rarely a central piece of any campaign. To be sure, fervent millennial support is an incredible boost to any campaign, and young voters tend to remain loyal to a candidate once they’ve committed. But achieving that commitment is so difficult — and millennial turnout is so unreliable — that mainstream politics has learned not to bother. Through decades-long legacies of voter apathy paired with the willingness to turn out for issues other than our own, we have taught modern politicians that, not only can our vote not be counted on, but our vote also does not depend on offering us anything we really want. So, with the 2016 presidential election close at hand, the millennial bloc is left with one stark reality; it is absolutely necessary that voters under 30, particularly students at colleges and universities, turn out this year — not only for the protection of our rights and the achievement of our interests, but also to reverse the notion that our voices as citizens are less important and less valuable than those of others.
To be fair, campaign strategists and political consultants aren’t entirely wrong in their dismissal of millennial issues — voter turnout among young people has been historically low. We don’t care, they say; especially now, in a world in which millennial interests are so easily circumscribed by technology, we are supposedly even less interested in politics. Some claim that we don’t understand elections, that they don’t matter to us, that we don’t read the paper and on Election Day, that we’re in the same place we’d be any other day — that is, not at the booths.
Elections are a science, after all. There is no point for campaign consultants, public relations experts or career politicians to spend their time on issues that matter to a constituency that won’t reward them with the vote. Young voters seem to think that if they don’t vote — especially if voting blue in a blue state or red in a red state — their candidate won’t notice. But to millennials, the reality is that if you don’t vote, your candidate won’t notice you.
Postmodern politics are littered with shining examples, if one cares to look — the cost of higher education has been climbing momentously for over 40 years and bringing down the price has only been a serious part of the executive agenda since Barack Obama’s run in 2008.
Young voters surged to support the President’s first bid for the Oval Office and again to spearhead his second term. Subsequently, pieces of the executive agenda became geared much more toward millennial issues. Voting is, by definition, the clearest form of representation — but it can also serve as an avenue to demand representation. For millennial needs to reach the agenda of the next president, college voters must continue and increase political involvement.
Luckily for us, the momentum from Obama’s era has manifested into the coming election; Wednesday night, Bernie Sanders of Vermont saw his first primary victory at 60 percent, beating Hillary Clinton by a 22-point margin. Eighty percent of his New Hampshire support base was under the age of 30. Clinton, by contrast, had the support of only 14 percent. True to the trend, the disparity in youth support is reflected in their platforms: Sanders supports free college tuition, more aggressively pursues economic equality and champions accessible health care — all especially relevant issues to voters under 30. By contrast, Clinton’s platform is much more focused on middle-aged and senior voters; she has proposed funding for Alzheimer’s research, expansion of disability rights, affordable health care and promises union support.
California might go blue regardless of whether a Democratic millennial chooses to show up on Election Day, but the role of millennial-voter issues for a future Democratic president’s agenda will depend on young voter turnout this year.
After decades of voter apathy, we’ve been able to turn it around. Let’s continue it for a third and fourth election and beyond — until our issues are considered platform-worthy national concerns instead of campaign-speech fodder.

Four years ago, the Women of Troy made their debut as a program, finishing the 2013 season with an 8-10 overall record. In just four seasons, the Trojans have made tremendous strides as a team and as a program, ending their 2015 run with a 14-6 record and a Round of 16 appearance in the NCAA championship tournament.
With 15 seniors on the roster this year and ten returning starters, USC’s 2016 campaign appears promising.
“[The seniors have] been in it from day one,” head coach Lindsey Munday said. “They’ve really bought in from top to bottom; every single person in the senior class is just all in and I think that’s all you can ask for as a coach, to have that level of buy in and for them to translate it to the younger players.”
Among the members of the senior class are All-MPSF First Team attacker Caroline de Lyra, who notched 38 goals last season and midfielder Amanda Johansen, who scored 40 goals of her own in the team’s 2015 season. Junior attacker and MPSF Player of the Year Michaela Michael will also be a key asset to the team’s offense, tallying 63 goals and 13 assists last season.
On defense, the team will look to senior Courtney Tarleton and junior Nina Kelty who recorded 34 and 12 ground balls respectively. To protect the net, sophomore Gussie Johns returns as the Trojan goalie with an 8.68 goals allowed average.
With a plethora of experienced upperclassmen and five new members to the squad, the Trojans look forward to beginning their 2016 season, kicking off their schedule with Stetson on Feb. 12th.
“It’s just time to get after it. We’re excited for our first game and to see our growth on the field,” Munday said. “We’ve seen it outside of lacrosse, in terms of leadership, and bonding and having fun and being able to compete at practice, but to see it now on the field is going to be the last step.”
In addition to the team’s experience on the field, the Trojans’ team chemistry will be beneficial, as the girls have gelled and gotten to know each other both on and off the field.
“We have a huge senior class and the chemistry has been really great this season. We’re all best friends on and off the field so that really helps,” Johansen said. “The chemistry is definitely there and it’s really improved season to season so I’m excited to see how the chemistry looks out on the field this year.”
After weeks of hard work in practice, the girls are looking forward to Saturday’s opportunity to translate their efforts into conference play. Looking ahead to the remainder of the season, the Women of Troy have a tough road in front of them, facing Duke on Feb. 20th, Stony Brook on Mar. 14th and Northwestern on Apr. 15th. Yet the Trojans are focusing on taking it one step at a time and one day at a time.
“We’ve faced our hardest obstacles growing to the point we are now so I think the next step is really playing to our potential and playing to the hype and really showing everyone how good we are,” Johansen said. “So we have to be pushing it every single day.”
For the seniors, this season provides an opportunity to leave their mark. Munday emphasizes that the girls have an ongoing legacy and that their commitment and dedication to the team began the moment they first put on that red and gold uniform.
“With such a big senior class, there’s always that feeling of wanting to leave a legacy and wanting to leave it the best you can possibly be,” Munday said. “But we are just trying to convey to them that they’ve already done all that. They left their legacy, they’ve already put so much into this program, so now it’s just time to enjoy it.”
The contest between USC and Stetson is slated for 3 p.m. Saturday Feb. 13th at McAlister field.

In 1993, Nirvana was king of the grunge world. Two years earlier, they released their breakthrough album, Nevermind, which garnered incredibly commercial success. Butch Vig produced that album, and he produced it very well; a little too well for the band’s liking.  (Butch would often trick Kurt into recording multiple guitar layers by telling Kurt he wanted to hear different takes of the same part.) When they began recording their third full-length LP in February of 1993, Nirvana decided it would return to its messy roots. They recorded for exactly two weeks, and later that same year, In Utero was unleashed onto the public.
The band was thorough in its search for a producer that would deliver the sonic landscape it was trying to achieve. Steve Albini was their man. Albini’s production work on In Utero has sometimes been criticized and even tinkered with, but I don’t think there’s any doubt that Albini made this record exactly how it was supposed to be made.
To start, Dave Grohl’s drums sound way heavier than they do on Nevermind. And the type of reverb Albini applies on the drums gives them a distinct sound that I’ve never heard reproduced. It does justice to Grohl’s relentless and deliberate drumming style. It also allows the drums to contrast nicely with the vocals and guitar, which are often left dry. All in all, listening to In Utero makes you feel like you’re in a garage with Nirvana as they play.
Though the record captures Nirvana’s shift to a much rawer sound, Cobain’s songwriting still possesses pop sensibilities. In Utero is a great example of the magic that happens when those sensibilities are mixed with the stripped-down anger of punk. Even songs like “Milk It” — a loud, rambling, abrasive piece of work — contain vocal melodies you can’t help but sing along to (just don’t destroy your throat). Make no mistake, Nirvana is not a pop band and In Utero is nowhere near being a pop album. In fact, the label was worried that the album had no commercial appeal. (They were wrong.)
As always, Cobain’s lyrics are not particularly happy; but they are still often amusing. The very first line of the very first song (“Serve the Servants”) is, “Teenage angst has paid off well, now I’m bored and old.” With this lyric and others Cobain shows how self-aware he is without being too pretentious about it. You always get a sense that, even during his most depressing lines, he’s being tongue-in-cheek.
Cobain also delivers an incredible vocal performance. Technically, it’s a nightmare, but In Utero certainly makes no effort to display a high level of technical prowess. I say it’s a nightmare because Kurt is constantly distorting his voice. And it sounds freaking amazing. His wailing on “Pennyroyal Tea,” his exclaimed “heys” in “Heart-Shaped Box,” even his incoherent yelling on “Tourette’s” gives In Utero the very last ingredient for a classic Nirvana album.
The one complaint I have about this album is that Krist Novoselic’s bass is sort of muddy and drowned out, so the audience misses out on his beautiful melodic bass lines. But whatever — this is still Nirvana’s best album.

The USC men’s volleyball team battled against No. 11 Cal State Northridge, but the Trojans fell to the Matadors in a tough five-set match (23-25, 25-22, 22-25, 25-13, 9-15) Wednesday night at the Galen Center. 
It was a battle between the two from the get-go. The Trojans (2-9, 2-7 MPSF) showed bursts of their true potential.
“How much closer can we be to being the team we know we should be?” head coach Jeff Nygaard said. 
USC managed to outplay CSUN ((8-4, 3-4 MPSF)  for the majority of the match. After the first set — even though they lost — the Trojans looked like their pieces were falling in the right places. 
Junior outside hitter Lucas Yoder had himself a strong first set, recording six kills while hitting .500. Yoder hasn’t seen much action in the last couple of matches. The junior finished the match with 17 kills and two blocks. 
“To start the match, he was the only one calling for it, so he got the set,” Nygaard said. “He started of getting a ton of kills, really in rhythm, and doing a nice job.”
Senior outside hitter Alex Slaught and freshman opposite Ryan Moss — who came off the bench — finished the match with 10 kills each. Slaught picked up two blocks and an ace, while Moss recorded four blocks. 
The Trojans threw themselves a bit of a block party in the second set, out-blocking Northridge 6-0. Junior middle blocker Andy Benesh hosted that party, recording four solo blocks in a span of six plays.
By the end of the match, USC had 12.5 blocks to CSUN’s 11.0. Benesh finished the night off with 6 blocks. 
“We’ve been focusing a ton on [blocking], talking about it, what we’re expecting, what we need to,” Nygaard said. “I think tonight the light bulb went on and clicked for a couple of players.”
Despite the team showing continued improvement, their play hit a lull heading into the fifth set, despite winning the fourth by 12 points. 
“We’re getting better at everything, we just don’t get over the hump,” Nygaard said. “After every game we win we somehow mentally slow it down.”
Slowing their game down affected their play following their win in the second set as well. In-game consistency is something that Nygaard sees the Trojans can improve upon. 
After the match, Nygaard was still in a bit of disbelief that they dropped that match that seemed theirs for the majority. 
“The way we played, I can’t help but feel we gave it away,” Nygaard said. 
Even though they lost, Nygaard is still optimistic about how much the team is continuing to improve. He sees the team as playing like more of a unit every day, but 
“It’s more of the frustration of looking at our record and going, ‘What is happening that we have this record with the talent we have, with the capability we have?’” Nygaard said. “If we play as that team consistently, all of a sudden the second half of the season is really going well for us.”

Bonita Nongluk | Daily Trojan
I am almost positive that every college student in his or her life has done one of the following:
Why are we like this? Is it just our generation that is so terrified of connecting, of engaging, of telling it like it is?
I’ve been on this campus a short six months, but every day I see countless examples of a terrified culture of millennials avoiding important interactions at every turn.
I myself am far from exempt. Just the other day, I spotted a new professor I have but avoided eye contact as we passed, in fear that he wouldn’t remember my name, or that we’d have nothing to say to one another.
This culture is dangerous.
College is the time to engage with everyone you can, to meet people from all walks of life, to be curious and friendly and approachable and to open as many doors as possible for yourself.
Universities have been revered not only as places of higher education but also as places where students have opportunities to frequently engage with one another.
When we pull out our phones instead of introducing ourselves to the person sitting next to us in lecture or when we stifle our thoughts and actions in fear of “coming on too strong,” we are changing the environment of our university to one where students are isolated and uninterested.
We are only limiting ourselves, walking right past opportunity, shutting doors left and right.
So many students here lack a true sense of community, but no one speaks up.
Perhaps this is because we live in a society where it is un-cool to reach out, to be straightforward or to show that you care.
Bart Campolo, the Humanist Chaplain at USC, strives to change this disconnected, unengaged environment. He hosts dinners every Sunday night for students looking for a sense of community to just get together, tell their stories, talk and connect. 
It’s so odd that this idea is such a novelty these days – that sometimes it seems downright impossible to “just be.”  
One of my best friends here, freshman Siobhan Boroian, is another student that echoes these sentiments of a detached, careless environment.
Ironically enough, it took us almost all of our first semester to even properly introduce ourselves.
In a freshman seminar class of only 12 people, almost all of us were either too afraid or  prideful to reach out, missing out on what could have been five more great months of friendship.
She and I were talking about this issue the other day and she showed me one of her favorite quotes by a modern day writer, Rachel C. Lewis.
Lewis writes, “I know how it is — we all want to be mysterious. None of us want to get hurt. None of us want to look desperate. So we wait to respond to texts, phone calls, emails … So we say vague, half-statements and expect people to read our minds … But what if we died?”
Yes, it seems a tad dramatic, but sometimes dramatic is what we need to finally hear the message, loud and clear.
This summer I had an ulcer rupture in my stomach and I had to go into emergency surgery. I was as close to being face-to-face with death as I could imagine, but oddly enough it wasn’t until I read the words by this obscure author that I finally understood the message.
As college kids we have potential oozing from our fingertips and opportunity knocking at every door. We are in an environment where exciting people, prospects and chances surround us. But in order to let our environment do us any good, we must live life as straightforward as possible.
We need to stop with the “chill Olympics:” no more avoiding eye contact and stifling introductions and hellos. We can’t be afraid to ask questions, make grand gestures and be candid.
Lewis writes, “There is nothing more risky than pretending not to care. We are young and we are human and we are not as in control as we think we are.”
Maybe it’s not always a matter of life and death, but it is a matter of our present and our future.
What do we want to make of this university environment? How do we want to be remembered and, ultimately, who do we want to be?
There’s no pause button on life, so go say hello to people, ask questions, introduce yourself and answer your texts in the first 30 seconds that you receive them. Do something you’ve always wanted to do.
No one ever remembered anything half-a**.

Samantha Lee | Daily Trojan
College is about learning, about knowing things. Yet, in my last semester of college I’ve been spitting out the phrase “I don’t know” like a broken record. 
“Are you going back to the East Coast after graduation, or are you staying in L.A.?” 
“I don’t know.” 
“What are you doing after graduation anyway?” 
“I don’t know.” 
“Do you think we should fly out to L.A. on Wednesday or Thursday before graduation?”  
“I don’t know.”
“Do you want to go to a late lunch or early dinner after your graduation ceremony?” 
“I don’t know.”
“What are you doing today?” 
“OH MY GOD I DON’T KNOW, JUST STOP ASKING QUESTIONS!” 
Recently, questions that I don’t have the answers to seem to be coming at me left and right, whether they’re being asked by my hyper-organized, serial-planner of a mother or innocent strangers who don’t know they are much better off just keeping the inquiries to themselves. There are a lot of unknowns in my life right now and I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t stressing me out a little. 
I prefer when things are planned out: when I can prepare and know what to expect, when I know what the future holds. Despite my best efforts, during the last few months my life has just not worked like this. Instead, unknowns have been popping up everywhere — from the big plans like where I’ll live after graduation, to the smaller details like planning travel arrangements with my family for graduation weekend. 
My mom has continued to nag me with emails containing a ridiculous amount of question marks, but I’m working to accept that fact that the unknown is okay right now. The questions I don’t have answers to at this exact moment shouldn’t keep me up at night, and it’s perfectly acceptable to put off my responses until later. Just like you can’t be expected to ace a class final on the first day of class, there’s no way I’ll have all the answers to everyone’s post-grad questions a month into the semester. 
At a school where everyone is so motivated to succeed and classmates land jobs, receive scholarships and awards that seem more and more impressive each day, it can be easy to forget that not everyone has all the answers quite yet. 
I know that over the next few months, one by one, my friends and classmates will inevitably begin to figure it all out, to come up with answers for the nagging questions from their mom, aunt, uncle, professor, acquaintance or random cab driver. 
In the mean time, I’ll try to keep reminding myself that in due time I’ll figure all this post-grad stuff out too, and that there’s no perfect timeline for making all these plans. For now,  there’s a good chance I’ll continue to field the same questions over the next few months, but for the time being, “I don’t know” will just have to suffice.

“Just as Dr. King asked all those thousands, I encourage you to uplift his legacy by continuing to dream,” Omete Anassi said to a crowd of onlookers in front of Tommy Trojan Wednesday afternoon. “Continue to dream that Martin Luther King Jr.’s ‘I Have a Dream’ speech will no longer be applicable to our nation because it will be fully realized.”
Anassi, a junior majoring in neuroscience, was joined by approximately 50 students and community members who gathered for the Black Student Assembly’s March on Trousdale event in commemoration of Black History Month and Martin Luther King Jr.’s March on Washington.
The march began at the Finger Fountain at approximately 11:20 a.m. In commemoration of the original 1963 march, students donned business attire and marched with signs reading, “We demand an end to police brutality,” “Black Lives Matter” and “Get in #Formation.”
BSA’s Next Generation Co-Chair Amaka Agodi said she and her fellow organizers were intentional about having a silent protest.
“We decided on a silent march because we thought it would be more impactful and convey a message of us trying to commemorate Martin Luther King Jr.’s March on Washington,” Agodi said. “We wanted to have it during Black History Month because it’s important to keep ourselves grounded and remember why we’re doing this and how far we’ve come.”
The march went through the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, where participants assembled themselves along the Steps of Troy and paused for a moment of silence. The moment of silence, which was symbolically held for four minutes in honor of the four hours teenager Michael Brown was left on the street after being shot by police in Ferguson, Missouri in August 2014, was also held in honor of Black Lives Matter activist MarShawn McCarrel, who committed suicide Monday.
Moira Turner, a junior majoring in anthropology and Undergraduate Student Government’s director of Diversity Affairs, highlighted the importance of the march going through main University centers.
“TCC is one of the golden hallmarks of USC,” Turner said. “So the fact that we could occupy that space and insert ourselves there to say that Black Lives Matter and that black students’ lives matter and that our mental health matters was very important.”
Though the event was organized by the BSA, the event drew out a diverse crowd of students. USG presidential candidate Edwin Saucedo, who is Latino, stressed the importance of solidarity among students.
“A big reason I came out was to stand in solidarity and support our groups on campus,” Saucedo said. “I think that it’s important to show a presence of the different issues we are experiencing across the nation and have people engaging in those conversations on campus.”
The march concluded in front of Tommy Trojan, where Center for Black Culture and Student Affairs Director Corliss P. Bennett-McBride led participants in singing the black national anthem, “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” This was followed by a spoken word rendition of King’s iconic “I Have a Dream” speech performed by Anassi, which he entitled, “Is the black American free?”
Though most of the participants were students, a number of members from the local community also took part in the event. Representatives from the Professional Community Intervention Training Institute, a local organization that trains and professionally certifies gang and crisis interventionists, encouraged students to create multi-disciplinary collaborations and partnerships.
“We were there for the originally ’63 march, for the March on Washington,” a PCITI representative said to the students. “Youth have led the movement and I say that to say that you guys are the leadership of what this country is going to look like in the next five, 10, 15 years. We are elders in the process … Use us to assist you in designing the direction you want to take — but you have to design the process.”
Some students expressed their frustration with the lack of administrative response to the event. Turner said that though both University President C. L. Max Nikias and Provost Michael Quick walked by the march, they did not respond to requests to address it.
“[The administration’s] complete and total silence is disheartening coming from a black student perspective on campus,” Turner said.
To BSA Executive Director Mykaila Williams, one of the primary goals of the march was to provide necessary spaces for students on campus.
“I’m hoping that what resonates with students is that they do have these opportunities on campus,” Williams said. “So they can say, ‘Even though I didn’t go to it, they do have marches on campus’. They do these kinds of things that give students the space to operate in the way that they want.”

The Trojan Marching Band performed in the Macau Chinese New Year’s Parade for the Year of the Monkey on Wednesday, making them the first American group to be invited to the event and the only college band in attendance.
The annual parade performed along Macau’s waterfront featured over one thousand performers from eight different countries, with televised broadcasts reaching more than 1 million viewers internationally. In addition to the parade, the Spirit of Troy performed at the historic Ruins of St. Paul, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
For junior and trumpet section leader, Emily Moneymaker, the ability to travel both domestically and internationally is one of the many benefits of the TMB.
“I’ve gone on over 20 trips with the band and have had so many amazing and unique opportunities thanks to my involvement in the TMB that would never have been possible otherwise,” Moneymaker said. “The TMB is truly a life changing group, and I’m so thankful for all of the incredible memories I’ve made with the group.”
Senior and former trombone section leader Roger Brown also appreciates the many opportunities the TMB has provided him.
“This is my first international trip with the TMB, and my second international trip in general. I am extremely grateful to participate in this event,” Brown said. “I’ve been on over a dozen domestic trips with the band, many of them to places that weren’t originally on my travel radar, [such as] Macau.”
For many members of the TMB, the trip was an opportunity to meet individuals from all over the world, including Spain, Portugal, Japan, Korea, France and Malaysia. For junior computer science (games) major and crash cymbals player Robyn To, a major highlight of the trip was the cultural exchange.
“We [had a] practice from 4:30 p.m. to midnight with all the groups performing in the parade and it was awesome to meet so many people from different cultures,” To said.
Whenever the group travels abroad, they accept their roles as ambassadors for USC. For fifth-year senior and drum major Chase Wagoner, representing USC abroad evokes feelings of privilege and pride.
“I take pride in the TMB’s role as ambassadors to the rest of the world,” Wagoner said. “For the parade, we’re performing ‘Fight On!’ and a few of our rock charts … [which] are great representations of the band and act as cultural exchange between the band and our audience.”
The group was also able to enjoy the city of Macau during their week-long visit. With extravagant shopping malls and an abundance of casinos, Brown relished taking in the local flavor and culture of Macau.
“We had a number of free nights to explore [and we] looked around some of the casinos, ate Chinese and Portuguese food, saw popular sights and participated in other cultural activities,” Brown said. “On our free day, many of us took a ferry to Hong Kong to explore there too.”
While traveling and enjoying international cultures is a unique experience, many band members’ true love for the TMB stems from a different source.
“Travel is a fantastic part of the TMB … my favorite part is the passion and camaraderie,” Wagoner said. “Being part of a 300-strong group yelling their hearts out for our defense or singing our fight song beats any other experience I’ve ever had.”

In the center of USC’s Health Sciences Campus Wednesday, a crowd of red-shirted demonstrators stood with picket-signs, chanting over the din of cars driving past, which occasionally honked in support. These health care workers participated in a one-day strike to demand better wages and more equitable treatment.
In negotiations that have been ongoing for over a year, Keck School of Medicine of USC staff represented by the National Union of Healthcare Workers has been trying to reach an agreement on a contract with USC-Keck.
Their primary complaints are short-staffing that strains adequate patient care, low wages that force workers to go on government assistance and a discriminatory lack of retirement and tuition benefits afforded to other USC employees.
Striking alongside NUHW workers were cafeteria employees working for Sodexo, a multinational food services company that employs 133,000 workers nationwide. Also picketing in solidarity was the California Nurses Association.
“It is not okay to short staff all of the departments: nursing, respiratory, PCT. At the end of the day we are running around, and really not taking care of the patients the way they deserve,” said Adela Rea, a respiratory therapist at Keck, during a midday rally. “This is a place of healing. If we rush that process and short staff, we’re not really healing, we’re just rushing them through.”
Keck administration has refuted these claims of short-staffing and poor treatment.
“This strike has nothing to do with patient care. It is a purely economic strike,” said Rod Hanners, chief operating officer of Keck.
Hanners emphasized the importance of remaining affordable and competitive with comparable health institutions such as Cedars-Sinai and the UCLA Health system.
The crux of the labor dispute, according to Hanners, amounted to three articles of negotiation out of 27 others that were agreed upon.
“We either enhanced a benefit or kept it the same. There were no takebacks,” Hanners said.
According to Hanners, Keck offered the NUHW workers a 9 percent wage increase over the life of the upcoming contract, providing the first wage increase of 3 percent last week, in addition to a $500 bonus.
“We offered a market-competitive increase,” Hanners said.
He also mentioned that the healthcare workers represented by the NUHW also receive a zero premium health care plan that other unions do not, the Anthem-Blue Cross HMO.
Following the one-day strike, the Keck Hospital of USC responded to the strike with a press release, stating that only a fraction of the represented workers participated in picketing and that treatment of patients continued as usual.

Oracle’s Larry Ellison was confirmed on Wednesday as the commencement speaker for the 133rd graduation ceremony. Around 60,000 people are expected to attend commencement.
Ellison launched tech giant Oracle in 1977. The company develops and markets database software and technology. Ellison stepped down as CEO in 2014 to become the executive chairman and chief technology officer.
Ellison is also a philanthropist and sports enthusiast. The Lawrence Ellison Foundation,  among other philanthropic efforts, supports biomedical research on aging and age-related diseases and disabilities.
Away from his professional pursuits, Ellison races sailboats and runs one of the world’s largest tennis tournaments. Ellison has financially backed the Oracle Team USA sailing team and brought the America’s Cup back to the U.S. Ellison also acquired the BNP Paribas Open, the fifth largest tennis tournament in the world.
“I think life is a series of acts of discovery,” Ellison told USC News. “We’re all interested in our limits, what we can accomplish in life and in discovering our own limits, we might find that in sport, we might find that in business. I think we’re always looking to discover new things about each other and about ourselves. I look forward to speaking with the Class of 2016 as they embark on their own journeys to seek out their limits and their accomplishments.”
Around 15,000 degrees will be conferred during commencement, either at the main ceremony in Alumni Park or at one of several satellite ceremonies. The event takes place at Bovard Auditorium starting 8:30 a.m. USC President C. L. Max Nikias will preside over the main ceremony at 9 a.m. in Alumni Park on May 13.

Members of the Black Lives Matter Los Angeles Chapter discussed the current treatment of African-Americans and the need for change at a panel Wednesday in the United University Church.
The discussion was hosted by the Price School of Public Policy, and the panel was composed of Melina Abdullah, a professor and chair of Pan-African studies at California State University, Los Angeles; Hector Villagra, executive director of American Civil Liberties  Union Southern California; Anya Slaughter, the mother of a child who was killed by Pasadena policemen; and Pete White, the founder and co-director of LA Community Action Network. The panel was moderated by Jody Armour, a professor in the Gould School of Law.
The panel opened with Slaughter sharing the story of her son, Kendrec McDade, who was shot and killed by two Pasadena police officers in 2012. She said that no justice was done to the individuals who were directly involved in the incident.
“They chased Kendrec with the lights turned on and never broadcasted that they were chasing him,” Slaughter said. “During the chase, one was driving the police vehicle and one was running behind him. They fabricated their stories to get off themselves of their wrongdoings,”
Abdullah said that stories like Kendrec’s become the fuel of their movement.
“For the families of people who have been killed, you cannot just keep moving,” Abdullah said. “Rather than simply wallowing in your sorrow, it is beautiful that you use it to help us get connected. What keeps us going is to recognize the way we are connected.”
Armour then asked the panelists about the power of social media in modern civil rights movements. Villagra explained the legality issues behind recording police abuse and introduced a mobile application, named Mobile Injustice, that the ACLU developed to encourage more people to participate in reporting injustice, using the 1992 beating of Rodney King that sparked the L.A. riots as a point of comparison.
“When Rodney King’s beating was recorded, it was almost one in a million,” Villagra said. “Now, the thought that somebody can have a cellphone on them and very quickly come to a scene and capture images of police violence, the odds are really high. Even if the officer were to grab your phone and delete the video you had recorded, it would not matter as the copy of it would be sent to our offices.”
White described what black people have gone through in the previous eras to achieve civil rights and proposed a guideline where the participants of the movement should stand now.
“We have to think about where the system came from – where it is rooted in,” White said. “Jim Crow, slavery, the Civil War, Martin Luther King Jr., the nationalist movement — the list continues on and on and no measure of tinkering is going to change that. The cell phone becomes a weapon and tool … it creates conversations that break through family table discussions.”
As the discussion reached its end, a student asked the panelists how they intend to advocate for people with different backgrounds, including the LGBTQ community.
“Among our co-founders of the organization, two of them identify as queer,” Abdullah said. “A core guiding principle for us is that ‘all black lives matter.”

Starting next fall, students living in Cardinal ‘n’ Gold  will be part of the movement to encourage sustainable living at USC.
Fourteen apartments in the building will soon become part of USC’s newest special interest community for people who actively want to participate in the reducing their carbon footprints. The “Sustainable Living” community will be encouraged to take part in recycling and composting, as well as energy and water conservation.
Though not mandatory, Erin Fabris, sustainability coordinator for USC Housing, believes students will participate willingly.
“Hopefully, the people who live there will want to participate, so we’re not really going to enact any enforcement measures. We’re just trying to make it as easy as possible for residents to recycle and compost everything they need to,” Fabris said.
In addition to resources to help students become more energy-efficient, the building is scheduled for extensive refurbishment this summer.
Each apartment will be outfitted with green technology including energy-efficient toilets, showers and LEDs. Existing furniture will be replaced by a third-party company that will use materials from the old furniture to create completely new pieces.
Fabris believes that the combination of students’ mindful behavior and updated technology could result in significantly lower utility bills.
“I would imagine that these are students who are already thinking about this and are environmentally minded, so a combination of technology and behavior will hopefully reduce the bill for these students,” she said.
Currently, various forms of green technology can be found in USC Housing, but come fall, Cardinal ‘n’ Gold aims to incorporate all of them in one place.
The program was initiated when USC Housing Director Keenan Cheung had the idea to start a zero-waste community at USC, where 90 percent of waste would be diverted from landfills for composting or recycling.
Months later it was reported that of all the other special interest communities, Sustainable Living had the second highest number of applicants.
“I think that the USC student body is starting to realize the importance and urgency of embracing the environment as something we need to care about,” said Ahlia Bethea, director of the Environmental Student Assembly. “With this being the second most chosen [special interest community], students are sending a message to administrators that sustainability is an issue that they care about and better practices are something they want to see at USC.”
This initiative is consistent with the USC Sustainability 2020 plan that was announced in Nov. 2015. Created by the faculty, staff and students comprising the USC Sustainability Steering Committee, the plan provides the framework for the university to incorporate sustainability. According to the website, the committee  hopes to reduce greenhouse emissions by 20 percent and divert 75 percent of all waste from landfills.
Though USC has made significant strides by replacing the majority of toilets, faucets and shower heads with low-flow models, Bethea believes there is still more that needs to be done.
“Many of our peers in higher education have done far more on their campuses in regards to sustainability,” Bethea said. “We have a long way to go, however, with the efforts of groups like ESA, the Sustainability Office and the assistance of faculty and administrators working collaboratively. More significant impacts are definitely on the horizon.”
