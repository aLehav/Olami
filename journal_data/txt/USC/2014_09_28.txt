Undergraduate Student Government officials are this semester working to revamp the spring admission and housing process at USC.
Instead of using a waitlist system, the university admits some students to matriculate in the spring semester. With the volume of applications reaching record numbers, spring admission has become a popular means of offering admission to students for whom there is not enough space in the fall semester.
Spring admission is not a process unique to USC. Many other schools, including UC Berkeley, Brandeis University, Northeastern University and Middlebury College also admit students specifically for the spring. Once current students go abroad or graduate early, spaces in housing, classes and other aspects of campus life become available.
The spring admission program at USC, however, is relatively new and underdeveloped compared to its counterparts. The administration began reviewing changes to the system after a panel of past spring admits voiced their complaints last semester, including concerns that they were not given the same opportunities to assimilate to into student life at USC.
USG Vice President Rini Sampath, along with USG Director of University Affairs Jordan Fowler and Assistant Director of University Affairs Brad Streicher met with administrators this past week to discuss the possibility of giving spring admits the option to live in university housing this fall. The group of administrators included Timothy Brunold, dean of admission; Katharine Harrington, vice president of admissions and planning; and Nahid Razavi, assistant dean of student development programs.
This suggestion is based upon the spring admission program at UC Berkeley, Fall Program for Freshmen. In this program, spring admits are essentially treated as fall students in terms of housing and extracurricular activities but take classes off-campus that fulfill UC Berkeley graduation requirements.
“Not offering students housing in the fall draws away from undergraduate experience,” Sampath said. “Students are missing a key semester of getting acclimated.”
A spring admit herself, Sampath said she experienced feelings of isolation from campus life and fellow students. She views the proposal to extend housing to these students as essential to improving their experience on campus.
Other spring admits also feel that being allowed to move into on-campus housing in the fall would have made a difference in their freshman year experiences.
“When I was initially accepted as a spring admit, there were little to no resources on how to spend my fall semester,” said Margo Brown, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering. “The university offered no abroad programs or partnerships with local colleges. Having the option to live on campus during the fall would have made me feel more a part of the university.”
According to Sampath, administrators were extremely receptive to the idea of offering housing to spring admits and creating other opportunities for these students during the fall. Once the construction on the new Village is completed in 2017, providing housing for spring admits will be a more viable option.
Harrington has encouraged the team of student government representatives to continue researching the spring admit process. New surveys are being conducted among past and present spring admits that will provide quantifiable information regarding the experience.
“Not living on campus during the fall definitely negatively impacted my freshman experience,” said Skylar Steinberg, a spring admit and sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies. “It would have been much easier to meet fellow freshman and get involved had I been offered housing.”
Though the proposal is in its early stages, USG hopes it will serve as a foundation to modifying the spring admit experience. The university hopes offering housing and other options for students will make starting school four months later than usual more attractive to prospective students.
“More students will be up to the challenge of being a spring admit if they can have the ‘freshman experience,’” Sampath said. “The university should not miss out on exceptional students because there aren’t the resources.”

Freshman swimmer Ian Silverman knows how to navigate the rough waters of life, both in and out of the pool.
Born with cerebral palsy, Silverman has faced his share of challenges early on in life. Cerebral palsy is a disorder that affects the brain’s cerebrum, the area of the brain that controls the body’s movement. The disorder varies in its severity but commonly results in decreased motor function in various parts of the body, as well as a loss of sensation, balance and muscle coordination.
Just keep swimming · Freshman Ian Silverman, above, won a gold medal in the 400 freestyle at the 2012 London Paralympics. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
“I don’t really view it as a disability at this point, mainly because I’ve just lived with it my whole life,” Silverman said. “I’ve just found ways to live around it.”
Silverman began his aquatic career at the age of 6. By the age of 8, he began to take his passion for swimming seriously and joined a local year-round team called the North Baltimore Aquatic Club, the program that produced famous Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps.
“Ian broke Michael Phelps’ Maryland age group record in the 50[-meter] freestyle when he was 10 years old,” Ian’s mother, Dawn Silverman, said. “What most people didn’t know is that when Ian was out of the pool, he wore braces on his legs. One set for day and a different set for night.”
Silverman, a native of Baltimore, Maryland, came to USC this fall in pursuit of higher education and to train with his teammates on the USC men’s swimming team.
Silverman was also recently nominated for the Paralympics August Athlete of the month in the Best Youngster category. Among five other established nominees, Silverman was the only one from the United States. Silverman said he was grateful to be nominated for the award.
“It’s definitely an honor [to receive this nomination],” Silverman said. “The other athletes, I know personally and they are great competitors. To be categorized with them is definitely a special feeling.”
Dawn Silverman said that Ian’s past coaches and mentors have fostered his can-do attitude.
“Ian is fortunate that his physicians, surgeons, teachers and coaches at North Baltimore Aquatic always focused on what Ian could do, and never his limitations,” she said. “One of the best coaches in the world, Dave Salo [head coach of USC men’s swimming], has invested in him. Ian’s in a great place to springboard into even more success in Rio and a tremendous life after swimming as a USC alum. A Trojan for life.”
Despite his condition, Silverman said he never stopped his journey to achieve his dreams and aspirations.
In 2012, Silverman went to the London Paralympics where he earned the gold medal in the 400-meter freestyle. He considers that moment one of his greatest accomplishments.
Additionally, Silverman has achieved the Paralympic world records in the 400-meter, 800-meter and 1500-meter freestyle and set Paralympic American records in the 200-meter freestyle and the 50-meter butterfly, among others.
“Ian has demonstrated much humility and humbleness amidst his accomplishments in the Paralympics and he has taken a leadership role among his peers on the Paralympic team,” said Henry Silverman, Ian’s father. “He has also become an inspiration to others in the disability community, as he has been an example of what individuals with disabilities can accomplish.”
Silverman said his parents are his biggest inspiration.
“They sacrificed so much for me,” he said. “Just driving me to the pool, there and back and then especially taking me to special doctors, specialists and surgeons and literally doing whatever they can do to make it easier on me. I mean it was incredible the lengths they went through.”
Silverman’s desire for high achievement is not limited to the swimming pool. Though he has not yet officially declared a major, Silverman hopes to transfer into the Marshall School of Business and also study cinematic arts, channeling his avid love for film.
”Ian has been a friend of me and my family for many, many years,” said William Cosgarea, Ian’s friend and teammate at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club. “In that time, I’ve gotten to know him as an excellent student, determined teammate, and amazing friend. Ian is a brother to me, and I look forward to seeing the great things he does as a USC Trojan.”
Silverman knew he wanted to attend USC after a campus visit and meeting with the USC head swimming coach Dave Salo.
“When I took a trip out here and visited I knew immediately this is where I wanted to be. From the swim team to the coaching staff to the school itself, it had everything I wanted and I just felt at home,” Silverman said.
After he graduates from USC in 2018, Silverman has his sights on the Tokyo Paralympic competition.

Two student representatives of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, juniors Rini Sampath and Luke Phillips, attended “Bipartisan Advocacy: Finding Common Ground,” a conference hosted by Harvard University’s Institute of Politics this past weekend that focused on civic engagement and bipartisan advocacy and featured top national political practitioners.

The Harvard Institute of Politics, part of Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, aims to expose undergraduate students to academics, activists and policymakers in the hopes that the students will consider careers in politics and public service.
“This conference really taught us practical ways that we can spur bipartisan dialogue on our campus,” said Sampath, who serves as the Undergraduate Student Government vice president.
USC is a member of the Harvard Institute of Politics’ National Campaign for Political and  Civic Engagement, a consortium of 25 colleges and universities that aims to engage the millennial generation in improving communities through collaboration and public service. At the conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Sampath and Phillips joined four dozen other National Campaign Ambassadors to formulate plans to address relevant policy issues in their home communities and on their campuses.
Speakers at the event included leading professionals with expertise in campaign and issue advocacy, government, and communications, including Dan Glickman, a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center; Steven Olikara, the co-founder and president of the Millennial Action Project; and Mark McKinnon, co-founder of No Labels, a nonprofit organization that aims to achieve bipartisan political action.
After returning to campus from the intensive training conference, Sampath and Phillips will use the skills they acquired at the Harvard Institute of Politics to implement advocacy plans through the Unruh Institute’s campus network, which combines the academic study of politics with practical field experience.
“Luke [Phillips] and I look forward to working with as many organizations as possible to bring the ideas discussed at Harvard to life at USC,” Sampath said. “Some issues aren’t specific to one political party. The beauty of bipartisan advocacy is valuing action and productivity over party alliances.”
Sampath and Phillips were selected for the conference by the Unruh Institute based on their academic achievement and demonstrated leadership on campus.
“This is a tremendous opportunity for our students to further develop their leadership skills and interact with some of the nation’s foremost political engagement experts,” Unruh Director Dan Schnur said.
“I came out of the conference with the renewed realization that — for better or for worse — our millennial generation will have a far deeper influence on the future trajectory of this country than any of us can now imagine,” Phillips said. “After attending the conference, I see that we need to open up a dialogue about what kind of country we want our kids to inherit, because that’s the country we will create in our lifetimes.”

This 1st of October marks the 50th anniversary of the Free Speech Movement that began at the University of California, Berkeley. On that day, thousands of Berkeley students surrounded a police car on Sproul Plaza and held it captive for 33 hours in protest of university bans against political activities on campus. The Free Speech Movement was an arm of the larger Civil Rights Movement, and it marked the nonviolent beginning of a decade of rebellion. The students and their movement reshaped national politics and planted universities as battlegrounds for public policy.
On this 50th anniversary, it is important to reflect on student activism at USC over the last few years. Why? Having experienced student cultures at different universities, it seems to us that USC students suffer from a moral and intellectual crisis with unorthodox politics. While classes consistently emphasize politics outside formal institutions, the day-to-day campus is disappointedly empty of any substantive political activity. Challenges and protests do occur, yet they seem to be passive, temporary and even isolated in nature.
Take sexual harassment and assault as examples. They occur constantly, yet University officials continue to lag on any real change that will punish those responsible for it. On their side, students supporting stricter punishments and change of school policy find themselves alone and even go unnoticed. Ari Mostov and Kaya Masler should be names familiar to USC students, as should be Emma Sulkowicz at Columbia University. Are they? But where were the large protests of students in response to the many rape incidents? Why wasn’t Bovard occupied? Why didn’t students walk out of class in protest? Perhaps we just don’t care enough.
Or take the incident regarding the controversial response of the Los Angeles Police Department towards the graduation party consisting mostly of blacks and Latinos last academic year. Regardless of the details, there were accusations of racial profiling towards the party, something that presumably would have not happened to its white counterpart. To protest the actions of LAPD and the subsequent responses by USC, students participated in a sit-in at Tommy Trojan and LAPD and DPS held a forum the following day to discuss racial profiling. While the forum was well-attended (which was great news), the sit-in was surprisingly small and composed of mostly black students. While sitting there, we asked ourselves: Why aren’t there more students here? Where are the members of other groups who suffer discrimination in other ways? What is causing USC students to be so apolitical in the face of clear abuses of power?
Our point is not to call out specific students who didn’t participate. Instead, it is to demonstrate that these social groups continue their fight alone, delaying any substantive change. At the risk of sounding controversial, where were all the black students who so eagerly attended the sit-in at Tommy Trojan, during events against sexual harrassment? Or where were all the Latino students during the event “Walk a Mile in Her Shoes”? Why don’t these groups work together and join as one in protest? Numbers are important.
Both students and administrators need to do their part. Former UC system president Clark Kerr famously stated, “The University is not engaged in making ideas safe for students. It is engaged in making students safe for ideas.”  Administrators and officials at USC have much to learn from these wise words. Our university seems to continually stumble when it comes to student safety and substantive policy change. Instead of seeking the next multimillion dollar gift, perhaps university officials need to pay more attention to the heart and soul of the campus, the students.
For their part, students need to understand that none of us are alone in our struggles. Pundits and academics alike continue to place solidarity and a broad support base as key in bringing about change. As a lesson, the Free Speech Movement would not have been successful if it hadn’t been for their inclusion of many student groups, including the Young Socialists and the Young Republicans (something we believe USC students might find unthinkable). Just as students at Berkeley joined together against an indifferent administrative apparatus, USC students need to do the same. All of this, of course, should be done in a peaceful, but united manner.
The clever ones among us will, of course, realize that the apolitical nature of our campus actually signifies the extremely political nature of our campus. Therein lies the problem.

Well, the truly clever ones among us will, of course, realize that the final paragraph of this column is not necessarily true at all.  Political apathy is just that.  Historically USC has tended to be a very centrist, or perhaps even slightly right of center, unlike public universities where students (particularly liberal or progressive students) tend to be more vocal.  
If however the writers are correct in their final paragraph assertion, then one might conclude that the “political nature” of students at USC is indeed generally more conservative, and therefore less vocal…. which in turn reveals what I suspect to be the true intention of the writers’ thesis which is that they wish USC students would be more vocal and politically active in favour of liberal causes.
If indeed the USC campus needs to be more active politically, then may I suggest the following:
Where was the outrage when the California Supreme Court decided that an illegal immigrant (who admitted to using false documents and to lying on countless forms through the years) was nevertheless admitted to the California Bar to practice, of all things, Law?
Where was the outrage when Governor Brown signed into law driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants, saying, “Now they can come out of the shadows, and drive safely to their jobs.” ?
Where was the outrage when Governor Brown (succumbing to the militant bicycle lobby) signed the law mandating drivers allow 3 feet of distance when passing cyclist on the roads… while NOT mandating or even addressing the fact that cyclist whiz past motorists with only inches to spare, and roll through stop signs and even red lights.
Where was the outrage over our President’s delayed reaction to the clear threat posed by ISIS/ISIL after two gruesome beheading played out on the world’s stage?
Where is the outrage over the DWP’s refusal to reveal financial records pertaining to the tax-payer funded special trusts it manages?
Where is the outrage over the zealous grasp that public unions continue to have on our local and state budgets as they continue to cripple our economy, while their members (police, fire, teachers) continue to do everything from filing false injury claims for leave, to billing for their time when they attend funerals, to inflating their pensions by applying last-minute vacation time?
The list is endless, but I suspect the writers of this column are really only concerned with specific activism.
This is a very silly reply and rather sadly typical of the kind of witless response than I fear is typical of many when it comes to this kind of debate. Firstly, the authors included the College Republicans of precisely the type of group they wanted to see be MORE involved. Secondly, what is left-wing about standing against sexual assault, racial harassment etc? It’s exactly the Right’s failure to even consider solutions to these problems that make them so irrelevant on campuses up and down the country. Lastly, your examples are one of national relevance rather than affect students as students on campus. That doesn’t mean that they should be cared about any less, but the authors are clearly talking about the former and your use of the latter examples is clearly designed to confuse rather than engage.
I don’t think my response was silly at all, and certainly not witless. To the contrary, I am told often that I elevate debate to a higher level (another reason I have the confidence to put my full name to my responses).
Second…, my initial references to conservative vs. liberal were meant to highlight the fact that liberals tend to be far more vocal (to their credit) with their concerns than are conservatives… and, that I have observed the USC community to be slightly more conservative overall than otherwise, which might account for the fact that the authors notice less “activism” at USC.
Third… I never suggested that the topics the authors raised were not worthy of debate or protest… or even that they were conservative or liberal.. (This is a distinction you drew.)
Fourth..  How could you possibly suggest that my concerns or examples were offered in an effort to confuse?  I was clearly suggesting that that there are all sorts of issues that deserve debate and protest, that are sadly rarely addressed by any sort of activism at USC.
Lastly…  How can you possibly suggest that the examples I provided are not of significance to students on campus?  That seems very narrow-minded to me.  And how are they specifically or only of “national relevance”?  I’m pretty sure they are of California state and local relevance, and I don’t think the authors were suggesting that the USC community should only engage in activism that affects “students as students on campus”.
I’m always happy to have an intellectually honest debate, but I’m afraid  your response to my reply was ill-conceived and misguided.
Whoever told you that you raise the level of a debate was lying to you. And I don’t think you can accuse interlocutors of assuming things in your post when the entire premise of your initial reply was a giant assumption about the authors’ intent. Anyway, the fallacy that undermines your entire argument is that apathy is conservative. There are Students for Life and College Republicans on campus, but they are as sparsely supported as any other cause. The apathy suggested a sort of narcissistic disregard for people who are not you. This is clearly problematic. The authors are arguing for an expanded sphere of human understanding that education is arguably meant to foster, although the utilitarian turn in Higher Education has arguably undermined attempts at fostering broader ideas of citizenship. The low-profile of religious groups on campus perhaps also points to this. But then you go on to suggest that, while you understand why conservatives might be less concerned than liberals about women getting raped on campus, that it is odd that people are not more concerned by people being able to drive to work elsewhere in the State. While people should feel connected to California as a political and cultural entity, it would surprise most that this should be of more concern than far more egregious thing happening yards from where many of us sleep. So your point seemed deliberately obtuse and designed to undermine an interesting and nuanced argument by the original authors. Their article deserved better than your rather unlettered tangent.
Jon – Your articulate (if not verbose) response suggests it would take much more than this feeble article to earn your praise as presenting an “interesting and nuanced argument”.  I’m further surprised that you are doubling down on your notion that the issues I raised should not be of concern to USC students.  That notwithstanding, no one should allow your pretentious prose or narrow-minded censorship to deter them from participating in conversation and debate.
*Sigh*. For there to be a debate, you’ll have to raise your level of reading comprehension. I never said that no one should be concerned or interested in the topics you raised, just that they were irrelevant to the article under discussion. An article which deserves a lot more constructive engagement than you have clearly given it.
…nor did I ever suggest, or give you reason to believe, that I “understand why conservatives might be less concerned than liberals about women getting raped on campus”.  You make too many personal attacks; It obscures and betrays your arguments.
I suppose it’s my “pretentious prose” and “narrow-minded censorship”! Seriously, just stop. You are not doing yourself any favors. But, indulge me by asking yourself one thing: why do you react so aggressively to being challenged to justify your own biases? Should one not learn to let go and perhaps admit one’s fallibility allows one to grow and learn?
Jon.. You’ve exposed yourself again.  Listening to others and learning from them works both ways.  You enjoy listening to yourself so much (yes, I’ve read your many other posts) that you assume others don’t also enjoy listening to you.  I’ve thoroughly enjoyed our conversation because I like to hear from others who disagree with me.  
My point was very simply from the beginning.  I reject the sincerity of the authors’ premise, if not the premise itself.  My experience has been that those seeking more activism are generally seeking more support for their own opinions.  I expanded the conversation by suggesting that to the extent more activism is “needed” at USC, perhaps conservative voices are the one’s not heard… and I proposed a list of examples that I feel should be important to all citizens.  
I appreciate and value your input, and certainly your right to express yourself.  I assert my right to the same, whether or not you agree.
I assume you’ll want to have the last word.
Feel free to continue. The problem is that you have not updated a very lazy assumption right at the start, despite my many attempts to correct you, as someone who is actually on campus. So let’s give it one last try:
a) The authors are not after people who share their opinions. They explicitly said that they want more activism from both the socialists and Republicans.
b) The authors are saying that no real voices are heard. That’s the problem. The focal point of isolated activism listed you have already pushed back as not something conservatives should ignore. So it’s not fair to say that ‘liberal’ issues are only getting an airing. And the campus is pretty much 50:50 liberal/conservative at the moment, with overwhelming apathy being the real winner.
c) Your list of national issues sidesteps the point the author is making: there are more than enough campus-related issues that students should care about. It seems strange to simply pick out your issues as somehow special, when there are rapes, murders, racism, educational issues etc that directly effect students on campus and should demand our energy as a community to tackle.
d) In summary, this isn’t a partisan thing. It’s annoying when conservative trolls on this site try and make everything about conservatives vs. liberals. It’s not. And it shows a certain pathology in modern conservatism that they seem to put ideology above our common community on campus.
Bravo! My son is a sophomore at USC, a political idealist, and a questioner of authority. He has been disenchanted with the lack of student activism, apathy, and complacency he senses at the university, as well as in our society at large. If our youth has lost its idealism, what is the political future of our country?

Earlier this month, YouTuber and British prankster Sam Pepper released a video, “Fake Hand A– Pinch Prank,” that featured him groping women on the street. Pepper, posing as a confused pedestrian with his hands tucked into his sweatshirt pockets, dissolved into giggles when the women discovered his arm reaching out from behind to touch them inappropriately. With a following of more than 2 million subscribers, Pepper incited heated controversy for his “prank.” Outraged followers called the YouTube star’s actions grossly inappropriate and uncomfortable. There are myriad methods out there to address aspects of sexual victimization, but a video of a YouTuber committing these acts isn’t one of them.

But Pepper, in a three-part series, insists his videos were merely part of a social experiment to raise awareness for sexual abuse. According to the Independent, Pepper claimed that “the clips were designed as a ‘social experiment’ to shed light on society’s flippant attitude to sexual abuse, which affects men and women equally.”  The second upload consisted of a woman doing the same actions Pepper did, but to men. Pepper, alongside the release of the video, tweeted, “Are you thinking yet?” to highlight the different reactions to women and men being sexually assaulted. YouTube subsequently banned the two videos on grounds that they had violated certain terms. The last served as an explanatory platform that panned out as little more than an excuse for his actions.
Pepper’s convoluted way of leveling gender inequality demonstrates that his message to curb sexual assault had gotten lost in his grotesque, butt-pinching actions.
Sexual assault is a serious and prevalent issue in today’s society. Pepper addressed this wholeheartedly. According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, some form of sexual assault happens once every two minutes in the U.S. Nine out of 10 rape victims are women, but that doesn’t mean the men who endure this horrific abuse should be forgotten either, another point to which Pepper attempted to call attention. He shared personal stories about his struggles with sexual abuse and his friend’s experience of being stuck in a marriage in which the wife was physically abusive.
Though Pepper’s words were poignant, his video stigmatized sexual assault all the more by making light of issues in a joking manner. We all know that sexual assault consists of disgusting actions that need to be stopped, and it is scarring for both men and women. But Pepper’s need to point out the difference between men and women in these cases is superfluous. He focuses too much on the reaction to sexual assault incidents rather than the very action of sexual attacks. Pepper fails to convey the gravity of committing sexual assault by demonstrating those very acts of offense in his video. Even though Pepper proclaimed he received consent from the paid “actors” in his video, they were still recipients of a gesture that invaded their private space. In many cases, this offense is punishable by law and could cause trauma and psychological damage.
Pepper, in missing the point completely, also doesn’t seem to understand his responsibility to his 2 million viewers. YouTube is a video powerhouse that streams around 6 billion hours of viewing per month, according to the Los Angeles Times. Every YouTube user holds the responsiblity to create content for a certain audience who will take in and, sometimes, internalize the images and audio that dance across the screen.
There is a responsible way to educate viewers, and Pepper has done that before. “Homeless — Tell me Your Story” is one of his past videos I personally connected with. In the video, Pepper engaged in intimate conversations with homeless people. Among the individuals he encountered, one homeless man shared his wish to lead a simple life and the obstacles such as self-identity and drug addiction that have kept him from achieving his dream. With this project, Pepper tactfully brought up the need to reach out to people living on the streets instead of just walking past them. It was an incredibly touching experience that taught through example, not through uncivilized pranking that would leave people furious.
In his past videos, Pepper has shown his ability to highlight a subject effectively, so I’d like to see him cover sensitive issues in a sensitive manner again. Works like “Fake Hand A–Pinch Prank” simply put that potential to waste.

Great article, but having the women’s consent to do that is no longer considered “invading their private space” I agree with the rest and I feel like the actors just simulated what the reaction would be when sexually assaulted, which it’s always not quite realistic. Lastly, I’m pretty sure that pinching someone’s bun doesn’t cause any sort of trauma…but it surely has psychological effects.

In its Mountain Pacific Sports Federation opener, USC’s No. 4 men’s water polo team got back on track with a 21-5 win over No. 11 Pepperdine after finishing fourth in the NorCal Classic last weekend. The Trojans extend their win streak against the Waves to 15, having not lost to them since 2005.
West Kostas Best Kostas · Senior driver Kostas Genidounias scored two goals against Pepperdine on Saturday. With this effort, he moved into a second-place tie for most goals scored in USC history. – Christopher Roman | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (11-2, 1-0 MPSF) started out with three quick goals to take an early 3-0 lead. Pepperdine then began scoring, and by the end of the first frame, the Waves cut the lead to 4-2. The Trojans turned on cruise control in the second quarter, extending their lead to 8-2 with four unanswered goals. The Waves and Trojans went back and forth scoring goals for the majority of the third frame, but the Trojans finished on a 3-0 run extending their lead to 13-4. USC continued to pile on the goals in the fourth, finishing on a 8-0 run.
USC threw the Waves off their game Saturday. Coming into the week, Pepperdine utility Luke Hewko might have been the second-leading scoring in the conference and Pepperdine’s top scorer, but he couldn’t manage a single goal against the Trojans. Pepperdine goalie Zack Rhodes averaged just over 10 goals-against per game, but the Trojans rocked the waves and Rhodes for 21 goals this weekend.
USC head coach Jovan Vavic said his team did not need a win against Pepperdine to gain confidence after two losses last Sunday to UCLA and California.
“I think we are a confident team regardless,” Vavic said. “I don’t think a loss is going to kill our confidence. We know that we are capable. This is an excellent team. It happens. Even the basketball champion Spurs have bad games … Against UCLA in the knockout tournament, we played pretty well. We didn’t win the game but played well in many areas.”
Nonetheless, Vavic did not undermine the importance of this win.
“We had a good week of training, and we played much better today … It is important to come here and play well,” he said.
Vavic’s faith in his team is understandable. In 2011, USC lost to Stanford and UCLA and finished fourth in the SoCal Tournament, but later went on to beat the Cardinal and Bruins and win a fourth straight national championship.
Ten Trojans scored against Pepperdine, and three Trojans reached significant milestones.   Freshman utility Bryce Hoerman led the Trojans in scoring with a career-high four goals. Furthermore, senior driver Kostas Genidounias’ two goals placed him in a tie for second place on the Trojans’ all-time scoring list. Lastly, freshman driver Lazar Pasuljevic tacked on the first goals of his career, scoring two in total.
Coach Vavic was glad to see his players get some rest after starting the season with three tournaments, each with four games in two days.
“They’re tired,” Vavic said. “We played four games in two days, and we’re traveling. By Sunday, we felt it. We were all a bit tired against Berkeley, but now it will be much, much easier to play just one game. We have the tournament coming up in two weeks with four games, but other than that most of the weekends are going to be one or two games.”
The Trojans look to bring their newfound momentum back home. They play their home opener on Saturday at 2 p.m. against No. 5 UC Santa Barbara. The USC Alumni game will follow at 3:15 p.m.

The college football season follows a predictable pattern each year. Early on, a number of teams have standout performances, with each squad making their case for elite status. Then injuries, upsets and conference play start, and the season begins to fall into focus. This generally happens at the end of September, when almost everything crystalizes.
This year is no different. We learned a lot in the first month. On a national level, elite defenses are few and far between this season. It seems like 56-49 shootouts are the new norm, an upgraded version of the old 17-13 grind-it-out slugfest.
At the Pac-12 level, it is abundantly clear there will be no easy victories this season. Combine a collection of coaches of the highest caliber and a crop of phenomenal quarterbacks leading explosive offenses, and you have the toughest conference schedule week in and week out in all of college football.
Such a demanding schedule casts a bleak shadow over USC’s upcoming games. The idea was that if the Trojans could get through Oregon State and Arizona State, October would be a cakewalk. But with the emergence of Arizona, Colorado and Utah as viable competition, gliding through October looks to be a demanding task.
That’s what we know. Unfortunately, there are still a lot of questions about the USC football team. While the 35-10 victory over the Oregon State Beavers appears to be a resounding blowout in the Pac-12 home opener, statistics certainly do not tell the full story of the matchup.
It was certainly a great bounce-back win coming off the bye, but USC’s victory left me feeling a bit uncertain about the rest of the season. There were positives, such as the freshman class taking another giant step forward. The collection of skill position players is the most impressive group of freshmen in a long time, anywhere. The linemen are continuing to progress, and there is not much more to say about cornerback-wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson, other than that he is one of the best freshmen in the country.
There are other bright spots on offense. Junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor and redshirt junior running back Javorius “Buck” Allen are dependable and dynamic. Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler shook off a first half where he was aiming it instead of throwing it, to look like his usual efficient, effective self in the second half. It appears that sophomore running back Justin Davis finally has his burst back, and junior Max Tuerk is developing into an All-American candidate as a center.
On defense, sophomore safety Su’a Cravens is phenomenal. He might be the best safety in college football, and if Saturday was any indication, he is gunning for most talented linebacker as well. Besides junior defensive end Leonard Williams, Cravens seems to make more plays in the backfield than any other Trojan. That is where the problems start, though.
I understand the preseason All-American is a dynamic, physical specimen. But a safety-linebacker hybrid should not be making more stops behind the line than the combined efforts of the defensive line and linebacking corps.
Though USC did not surrender a touchdown on defense, I can’t help but feel unsettled about the Trojans’ defensive unit. Whether it was junior cornerback Kevon Seymour failing to turn repeatedly on back shoulder throws or the bevy of avoidable penalties on an assortment of Trojans, the defense was underwhelming. This was not a dominant performance by any stretch of the imagination.
One bright spot was the tip by Jackson to emerging sophomore safety Leon McQuay III, who then secured the interception in the endzone. That duo will be the cornerstone of a stingy secondary for the next few years. The pick by McQuay had shades of Richard Sherman and Malcolm Smith for the Seahawks against the 49ers last season, which was only fitting as Smith led the Trojans out of the tunnel.
Overall, time will tell if the ’SC defense is suited for the 3-4. The Trojans seem to have trouble defending screen passes, which happens to be an Arizona State Sun Devil specialty. If ASU has its starting signal caller back next Saturday, the Trojans have to step it up in order to win.
Forget UCLA and Notre Dame, there are no certain victories over the next six weeks. USC could conceivably hold each team they play to low double digits like Oregon State and Stanford, or they could give up close to 40 like they did against Boston College. Four games into the year, the outlook of the rest of the season is hazy at best. While we know the future of the program is incredibly bright, the present has yet to be determined.
The direction of this year is not dependent on the defense though — it is up to the offense. Even though they sustained multiple drives on Saturday, the offense is not truly a fluid mechanism yet.
This could be the play calling or it could be the execution, or a combination of both. Either way, the offense will need to step it up in Pac-12 play. Maybe throwing it more to sophomore wide receiver Darreus Rogers, who happens to score almost every time he touches the ball, would be a step in the right direction.
It seemed that the team found a groove from the second quarter on, once Kessler started moving out of the pocket and putting some zip on his throws. Here’s hoping that continues, and Sarkisian and Kessler prove that they stack up near the top when it comes to quarterback-coach combinations in the Pac-12. After all, 52-49 gets you the same result as 10-7 — a victory. At the end of the day, that’s what matters.

It was USC’s redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler, not highly touted Oregon State gunslinger Sean Mannion, who looked like the future NFL star during the Trojans’ 35-10 win over the visiting Beavers on Saturday night.
Beaver beater · Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler went 24-for-32 (75 percent) for 261 yards and two touchdowns in Saturday night’s win against the Oregon State Beavers. The Bakersfield, California native has yet to throw an interception on 132 attempts this season. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
 
Then-No. 18 USC (3-1, 2-0 Pac-12) overcame some early jitters to dominate large stretches of the game, while Oregon State (3-1, 0-1) never seemed to be able to get its vaunted passing attack off the ground.
The Trojans’ much maligned secondary held Mannion, who entered the game averaging 301.0 yards per game, to only 15 completions and 123 yards. Kessler, meanwhile, picked apart the Beavers’ defense for 261 yards and two touchdowns.
Though the win was by no means perfect — the two teams combined for a ridiculous 232 yards of total penalties — USC head coach Steve Sarkisian was pleased with the result.
“I’m proud of our football team,” Sarkisian said. “We have room for improvement, we need to play better next week. But it’s great to be 2-0 in conference play.”
Sophomore safety Su’a Cravens foreshadowed a monster performance midway through the first quarter, intercepting a Mannion screen pass and returning it 31 yards to open the scoring. The Los Angeles native would go on to add six total tackles, a sack and another tackle for loss.
The pick-six marked Cravens’ first career touchdown.
“Credit to the coaches,” Cravens said. “We called a zone, we knew they wanted to get it out to the flats with their big tight ends. They ran them out and I just happened to make a play on the ball.”
Just as quickly as it arrived, however, the Trojans’ early lead vanished when Oregon State’s Ryan Murphy took the ensuing kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown. Murphy, who starts at safety for the Beavers, sidestepped USC sophomore safety Leon McQuay III while tiptoeing down the sideline for the score.
Mannion began to show off his NFL-ready arm in the second quarter, leading the Beavers on an 11-play, 72-yard drive that culminated in a field goal. The senior quarterback’s favorite target on the drive was wideout Richard Mullaney, who caught passes of 29 and 27 yards. The drive marked Mannion’s only sustained success all game, a point of pride for Sarkisian and the USC defense.
“Being disciplined was a point of emphasis for us,” Sarkisian said. “All in all I think for the entire game our discipline was very good. We were in the right places at the right times, I think we had bodies on their receivers and the windows were tight. We might have been a little over-aggressive, but we did enough to make [Mannion] uncomfortable in the pocket.”
USC would respond on its very next series, converting two crucial third downs in Beaver territory to set up a 16-yard touchdown strike from Kessler to sophomore tailback Justin Davis. Davis collected 112 all-purpose yards and two total touchdowns on the night.
The Beavers’ final drive of the first half looked destined for points, until freshman cornerback-wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson tipped a Mannion pass into McQuay’s waiting hands in the corner of the endzone. The Beavers had moved into USC territory with the help of multiple key penalties, including a 15-yard facemask call on senior linebacker Hayes Pullard.
McQuay’s brilliance set up a wild ending to the first half. Facing fourth-and-15 from Oregon State’s 48-yard line on the following drive, Kessler ran the game clock down to 0:01 before connecting with sophomore wideout Darreus Rogers for a Hail Mary-style touchdown. Senior kicker Andre Heidari’s extra point improbably made the halftime score 21-10 in favor of USC.
Kessler explained his mindset going into the play.
“I knew exactly what [Rogers] was thinking,” Kessler said. “We practice it two or three times a week, in case we get in those scenarios. [Rogers] made an amazing play. I really think that sparked us for the second half. It was a really big play that got the crowd pumped up too.”
Oregon State blocked a Heidari field goal attempt late in a third quarter that featured no points.
The fireworks returned just 30 seconds into the final quarter, however, in the form of 17-yard run from redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen. The scoring play was immediately preceded by a clutch third and long conversion from Kessler, who found junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor for a 11-yard gain while in the grasp of an Oregon State defender.
Davis added his second score of the day on a 21-yard run midway through the quarter, capping the 25-point win. Redshirt freshman quarterback Max Browne led the Trojans onto the field for the team’s final, clock-killing drive.
The Trojans will be back at the Coliseum next Saturday, facing off against Arizona State. The Sun Devils are currently without starting quarterback Taylor Kelly, and suffered a 62-27 beatdown at the hands of then-No. 11 UCLA  on Thursday — a loss that resulted in them dropping out of the national rankings completely. Still, Sarkisian knows the Trojans will have to improve in several key areas in the next seven days.
“We’ll take it,” Sarkisian said. “We love the fact that we won. We love the fact that we’re 2-0 [in Pac-12 play]. But we can be better.”

Many can still recall Ellen DeGeneres’s stunt at the Academy Awards earlier this year. The beloved TV host ordered pizza in the middle of the Oscars and even had Brad Pitt serve slices to the guests. But who were the creators of those Neapolitan-style pizzas, and where can we get our hands on them? Brothers Edgar and Erik Martirosyan are the co-owners of the Big Mama’s and Papa’s Pizzeria franchise. The duo has enjoyed a successful year so far: Not only did Ellen boost their publicity with her move at the Oscars, but the two also just opened a new restaurant in the heart of Silver Lake called Wood.
Named in her honor · Wood has a vegan cheese and vegetarian pizza named after Ellen DeGeneres, who boosted the owner’s sales at Big Mama’s and Papa’s with her famous pizza stunt at the Oscars this year. – Mac McDonough | Daily Trojan
Located near the corner of West Sunset Boulevard and Silver Lake Boulevard, the modern, trendy atmosphere blends in perfectly with the neighborhood. The top-notch artisanal pizza, on the other hand, is a definite standout. The interior of Wood is modern and minimalistic, but if you walk out onto the patio, the space immediately feels much more cozy and personal. Due to its location overlooking the street, it’s perfect for people watching.
The menu offers a wide selection of 12-inch, hand-formed, hearth-baked pizzas ranging from a classic margherita ($12) to vegan options, including “The Ellen” (named after the woman who helped put the brothers on the map), a vegan cheese pizza with grape tomatoes, garlic, purple cabbage, beans, red onions, serranos, avocado, cilantro, lime juice, extra virgin olive oil and a balsamic glaze.
After customers order, the service basically ends. Water is brought to your table along with your food but don’t expect to be waited on hand and foot. There appeared to be no service staff, except for the somewhat intimidating and abrasive cashier, who seemed to be having a bad day.
Luckily the pizza was able to make up for the unfriendly exchange. The Baby Zucchini and Patty Pan Squash pizza ($15) is reasonably priced, considering the ingredients were either purchased at a local market or shipped directly from the capital of pizza, Italy. This particular dish had fresh mozzarella, burrata cheese, grape tomatoes, fennel, roasted garlic and oregano. The pizza, four slices in total, arrived with a decent amount of perfectly grilled vegetables, atop a bed of savory melted mozzarella. The best element by far, however, was the creamy burrata blend, glazed with extra virgin olive oil.
The crust, a good balance of thin and doughy, held all of the ingredients together, and the edge was charred with a pleasant chewy-bubbly consistency. The brothers made sure to research every aspect of Italian pizza and are committed to serving quality dishes using the best ingredients and tools, which is evident in the mixer they shipped in from Italy for kneading the dough.
For those looking for lighter options, Wood offers a selection of sides and salads. A highly recommended starter is the Crispy Brussels Sprouts ($7), accented with a pomegranate molasses. The caramelized vegetable was a light, crispy appetizer great for holding appetites at bay until the pizzas arrived.
All in all, if you order right, you will leave Wood feeling satisfied without having burned a hole in your pocket.

The Wiltern Theater might not have been completely sold out on the evening of Sept. 27, but that didn’t stop Paolo Nutini from giving it his raucous best. The Scottish 27 year old brought a rousing two-hour performance to L.A. concertgoers this past weekend. Though he is perhaps most famous in the States for his upbeat “New Shoes” (with it’s catchy refrain: “I put some new shoes on and suddenly everything is right”) the Paolo Nutini that greeted fans this Saturday seemed to have shelved the chipper sound from his first album, hid away the sophomoric beats from his second and paved way for the entirely new sound of Caustic Love, his third album, which blends soul, pop and alt-rock, peppered with numerous allusions and references. 
Opening for Nutini was the Wisconsin-born PHOX — a dreamy, lyrical seven-piece band front-lined by singer Monica Martin, the only woman of the group. Despite the fact that the back of the audience talked through most of PHOX’s set, Martin held her own as her bandmates chimed harmoniously on a keyboard, bass, drums, electric guitars and the occasional (and extremely well-placed) French horn. While crooning out “all this leisure has got me tired,” it became clear the group’s mix of sounds reminiscent of Fleet Foxes, Feist and Grizzly Bear were a far cry from what the audience had paid to watch, yet they provided a well-chosen contrast to the bouncing, clapping, preaching new Nutini they were about to see.
Slinking onto the stage with his characteristically unkempt hair and an untucked white button-down shirt, Nutini was joined by The Vipers, a group with several guitar players, a drummer and a back-up female singer — all of whom Nutini thanked graciously and profusely at the end of the show. Channeling moments of Al Green, Nina Simone, Bob Marley and Rod Stewart, Nutini proved his weight in the variation between his upbeat, crowd-summoning anthems and his romantic, tortured, sorrowful love ballads. “Diana” and “Better Man” seemed to be his most heartfelt and personal songs of the night — both appeared to be about women whom he has both loved and learned from. Yet, Nutini also escaped from the ballad arena to find a moment to sing the beautiful, rasping “Iron Sky” — where he descended into an almost gospel-like sermon about salvation, freedom and life while sampling a speech from Charlie Chaplin’s 1940 film The Great Dictator that states: “You are not machines. You are not cattle. You are men … You the people have the power to make this life free and beautiful.” As he sang, Nutini crouched down to the ground, recreating someone in pain, and then sprung up as if suddenly consumed with the beauty of living. He continued bouts of these exaggerated movements throughout the show, which was perhaps the only thing off about his entire performance. For several of the songs, he seemed to want to explain exactly what he was singing about. He’d mug a sad face when singing about sadness or point out to the crowd when crooning “you” during his ballads; these moments of literal communication weren’t needed in a show filled with already clear and lyrical yet poetic imagery.
Yet, Nutini’s real adeptness as a performer came in playing with the audience, especially with the females in attendance. After finishing the first up-tempo song of the night called “Scream (Funk My Life Up),” Nutini took a breath and told the audience, “This song is for a special someone in my life.” As women catcalled and screamed in ripples throughout the audience, Nutini raised the mic to his lips, smiled and added, “my mother.” To which, of course, the audience went wild. He then sang “Someone Like You” — a short and sweet song made beautiful by “ooohs” and “ahhhhhs” from The Vipers reminiscent of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons while keeping Nutini’s trained yet appropriately rough Scottish voice ringing clearly at the forefront.
At one point Nutini asked the audience, “Are you sick of new songs?” apparently gauging the fact that his two major hits, “New Shoes” and “These Streets,” were missing from the lineup. Of course, he did revisit some old hits, most notably “Jenny Don’t Be Hasty” and “Pencil Full of Lead,” the former of which was almost unrecognizable in a reworked rendition. Ultimately, the reworked oldies showed Nutini’s great departure from his past. Yet, he still finished the night with the dizzyingly beautiful “Last Request” — a ballad from his first album that plucked the heartstrings of most everyone in the room that night.

If your team is struggling as of late, you might want to shake things up. It is getting to the point in the season where if your team is 0-4 or 1-3, things need to change. In most cases, this is going to take a drastic change and as a team owner, you cannot rely on just the waiver wire to drag your team out from the gutter.
Tampa Bay’s Doug Martin is one player that has the potential to turn your fantasy football season around. — Adam Bettcher / Getty Images
Perhaps your chance at changing the course of your season is with a massive trade that gets the rest of your league to take a step back and really appreciate its magnitude. While obviously it is ideal to trade for a stud like Aaron Rodgers, Calvin Johnson, amongst many other big time names… this may NOT be your best strategy.
Take a risk and target a guy that as of right now isn’t having the best season, but who has the ability to break out. He’s cheaper than a stud and could give you ultimate bragging rights by making you look like a fantasy genius. Most fantasy champions already have one or two of the major breakout stars on their team, so if you want the hardware at the end of the season, make a move. Here are some guys that could either turn your fantasy team around or keep you on track for your big celebration as league champion.
 
Doug Martin, RB, Tampa Bay Buccaneers
Doug Martin, or the muscle hamster, has been plagued by injuries since his rookie year. A knee injury has kept him limited this year and he is looking to week four to have his breakout game this year. The muscle hamster has all the potential in the world to return to brilliance and put up similar numbers to his rookie year where he rushed for 1,454 yards and eleven touchdowns. He is relatively cheap to acquire because of his injury history and if his current owner has any doubts in him, I would try and make a deal for him before he has a big game.
 
Keenan Allen, WR, San Diego Chargers
Keenan Allen came into this year with such high expectations after a stellar rookie season. He was highly drafted and thus far has let his owners down. However, do not let this deter you from acquiring him. Allen has been struggling with a groin injury and with Phillip Rivers as quarterback look for a good rest of the season from Allen. Hopefully whoever owns Keenan Allen is frustrated enough with his production to let you snag him away.
 
Rob Gronkowski, TE, New England Patriots
This target may seem rather obvious because lets face it its GRONK, but owners may forget how good he could be. When healthy Gronkowski was on the same level, if not better, than the best tight end in the game Jimmy Graham. If you can acquire Gronkowski cheap enough definitely take that chance because he has the potential to return to form and make a serious impact in every single game for the rest of the season.

The outrage over an article published in The Gazette, a student publication at the University of Western Ontario, on August 19, 2014 forced a lot of students to rethink their parameters of choosing a college to spend four years—or even more—at. The adverse response to this article titled “So you want to date a teaching assistant?” seems to suggest that colleges are becoming more thin-skinned by the day.
According to TIME, the union representing T.A.s called for the piece to be taken down for promoting sexual harassment and the university provost publicly reprimanded the paper for being “disrespectful.” The offending material was quickly pulled off from the paper’s website and the editors wrote a groveling, ritualistic apology, promising to report “on these issues in a more serious manner in the future.”
The article was all about tips that could possibly help a student to get the attention of the TA by standing out as a pupil of interest, asking smart questions and answering some dumb ones, dropping in at office hours. From how critics might see it, all of this advice would only improve the students’ performance in that particular subject so what’s the harm.
Another astonishing remark that the union said was that the piece had essentially been “a guide on how to sexually harass another human being.” Most likely, all the USC students who attended the Title IX presentation, a mandatory meeting for all incoming students each year educating them about sexual misconduct, among other things, won’t find it hard to spot a huge difference between ‘sexual harassment’ and taking little steps to make yourself look more presentable in front of someone.
American colleges are a global hub of knowledge with a contribution of $24 billion to the U.S. economy by foreign students during the 2012-2013 school year, 12% more than the previous year, according to trade group NAFSA, the Association of International Educators. Now, cases like this that suppress the students’ right to freely express their notions will gradually offset a lot of potential students. Also, barring students’ from discussing such topics in open leads to an atmosphere of superficiality and secrecy. Accepting all that’s happening around them without questioning is certainly not how our leaders of today would envision leaders of tomorrow.
The apology letter published for the Gazette’s Frosh Edition includes phrases like “lack of judgment”, “regret this mistake”, “removing the Frosh Issue from Campus”. This reflects how much impact the argument of an opposition to a frivolous, just for fun article can have. It’s a certainty that the topic isn’t one that has never been discussed before in college. Also, it does not mar the emotions, culture or beliefs of any individual in any way.  So, removing the article from the magazine seems like a step too harsh to be fully justified.
It’s true that TAs are there to guide students through the class, but it’s also true that outside class, they are students as well. It’s absolutely okay to discuss these topics in public and views from both the sides are obviously more than welcome. What could’ve been a better way to put forward their argument against the article was writing another article explaining how they felt about the topic for the same target audience. After all, pen is always mightier than the sword.
The topics, the issues and concerns that really need to be considered are neglected due to the shift of focus to things that will not make any sort of a gigantic difference. Amidst the debates on putting five unconstitutional Disciplinary Charges on a student of University of Oregon on June 13, 2014 for cracking a four word joke and threatening a student of Citrus College with removal from campus on September 17,2013 for asking a fellow student to sign a petition protesting NSA surveillance of American citizens, the essence of freedom of speech and expression granted to students in college is degrading. Increasing sensitivity from the critics is stopping students from becoming the thinkers of today’s world.
So, laws that bring all the rules and policies related to the extent of freedom of speech and expression through journalism of all the universities should be revised so that no student in any college is getting a less fair treatment than he or she deserves. After all, there’s very little point to college if it doesn’t allow students to think out of the box.

With the surplus of news segments, radio advertisements, and flashing reminders on the side of the freeway, everyone in California knows that the state is in the midst of a drought. Even with this knowledge, many Californians are blatantly ignoring the severity of the situation and continuing in their daily water habits without adjusting to the reality of the drought.
California residents are seasoned veterans of droughts, and have become nearly immune to the flurry of reminders to save water. However, this drought is the most severe drought on record in the state’s history. It is serious enough that in January, Governor Jerry Brown officially declared the drought a State of Emergency, and set a goal for the state to cut water usage by 20 percent.
While setting the record for the most severe drought on record, it seems as if California might also set the record for the most lackluster response to an emergency situation in recent history.
The drought simply doesn’t feel like an emergency. Residents are hardly in a state of panic; water habits largely remain unchanged, and many residents are just now starting to cut back on water usage.
An outsider observing water habits in California would never guess that the state currently only has enough water in storage to last 12 to 18 months. The lush lawns, green golf courses, and constantly clean cars certainly don’t point to the issue. For the most part, the “State of Emergency” is yet to make a palpable difference in the state’s water habits.
Some people argue that it’s pointless for residents to cut back on their daily water use because residential water usage is so small in comparison to commercial and agricultural water usage. This argument would be valid if residential water usage was completely insignificant compared to commercial use, but in reality, this is not the case.
Vik Cuthbertson | Daily Trojan
Although residential usage makes up just approximately 14 percent of California’s total water use, that’s substantial enough for individual water conservation to make a difference, if enough individuals conserve. Individual conservation is particularly imperative in Los Angeles, where annual residential water sales surpasses annual commercial water sales by 73 billion gallons.
Governor Jerry Brown’s call for a 20 percent reduction in water use wasn’t meant just for commercial users, nor was it directed only at residential users. Corporations and individual residents alike should take the 20% reduction goal as motivation to be more responsible about water use.
Water conservation begins at the individual level, especially since residential water use offers myriad opportunities for conservation. Voluntary conservation methods range from simply taking shorter showers to completely new landscaping.
Unfortunately, Californians historically haven’t been eager about voluntary conservation. If residents were more proactive about conserving water prior to the drought, there would currently be more water in storage.
This is exactly why government officials needed to step in. On July 15th, officials approved an emergency state rule that allows authorities to fine residents caught wasting water up to five hundred dollars.
Finable practices include excessive runoff from outdoor sprinklers, hosing off driveways, and decorative fountains that don’t reuse water.
These measures will hopefully at the very least force residents to start taking the drought seriously, and instill a sense of urgency. Obviously, not everyone who wastes water will be fined, so the new litigation probably won’t scare everyone into conserving water.
These fines basically function as a public service announcement. Their mere existence proves the seriousness of the drought, and hopefully this will motivate residents to make smarter water choices.  Commercial sites can conserve water through the same practices as residents, only on a larger scale. For example, farmers and residents alike can abstain from growing non-native, water-guzzling plants.  Even at the commercial level, water conservation depends on individual initiative. Farms, businesses, and factories are all led by individuals, and once these individuals make water conservation a habit at home, they could bring these concepts with them to their workplace.
Once again, solving California’s water shortage ultimately comes down to individual conservation efforts. It’s simple: all California residents use California’s water, so everyone is responsible for saving it.
Besides Jerry Brown’s 20 percent reduction goal, here’s another goal for California residents: make the drought conservation efforts a daily habit. Instead of returning to old wasteful habits once the dry season ends, Californians should consistently strive to conserve water.  Proactive prevention eliminates the need for future emergency control.

Most 20-something’s love water parks. Most 20-something’s also are in college. So, it makes intuitive sense to satiate the needs of 20-something’s thirst for water parks by adding them to college campuses, right?
Right – according to many Southeastern universities.
In 2016, Louisiana State University is expected to have a new lazy river, which will spell out the letters “LSU” in the school’s Geaux font. At Auburn University in Alabama, a 45-person paw print shaped hot tub provides a relaxation for students, while a 20-foot wet climbing wall provides exhilaration for those same students. North Dakota State trumps both schools, though, with construction scheduled to begin next year for a zip line students can ride out over a 36-foot-diameter pool, complete with an island in the middle of the pool with a recessed fireplace. Cozy.
At first glance, these renovations may seem amazing. It would be phenomenal to have a lazy day every once in a while and maybe soak in the pool when finals get a bit too hectic – but when you have a lazy river right on campus, how often does “once in a while,” become? According to a New York Times article, a junior at Texas Tech University says “As it gets warmer, you start seeing less people in class.”
When we think about a university, we should think about education. The very definition of a university, per the Oxford Dictionary is an “educational institution designed for…advanced learning.” The addition of recreational facilities above and beyond what students need start to detract from this definition.  
These rec-centers also quickly go from a relaxing day at the pool to an amusement park zoo, which takes away from the appeal of having a somewhat private water park. The same junior mentioned above also explained “Everyone will say, ‘Let’s go float in the river.’ There will be, like, 300 people there, and there won’t be any inner tubes or rafts left.” This number is nothing compared to the exponentially abundant population of students swarming Texas Tech’s two acres of lazy river, water slide and tanning deck, during the beginning of the year pool party.
Granted, many of these schools are huge athletic powerhouses, and recruitment is a huge deal. A lazy river always sweetens the deal during recruitment season. With a strong recruiting class, alumni are keener to donate and support their alma mater programs, and stronger recruits mean better games which mean more merchandise and ticket sales. However, the money that is generated is often for a specific population of students. It makes sense that many of these universities are competing in an arms race for the best recreational facilities, but are the funds divided fairly?
Even without the question of equitable divides, there is no question that college tuitions are continuing to rise. A rise in college tuition going towards research and development for your degree seems logical, but a rise in college tuition going towards creating an extra lazy river seems to perpetuate a lazy student body. A study by the Huffington Post recorded the average student who obtained a degree in 2012 to incur a student debt of $29,400 – up 63% in less than a decade. Rather than raise tuition prices and therefore raise the amount of debt students graduate with, these rec-centers add to the financial strain of students and their families, for quite a marginal amount of fun. In the long run, the costs grotesquely outweigh the benefits, but that’s a hard foresight to realize when you’re lounging poolside.
The students themselves shouldn’t be criticized, though, because it is the responsibility of the administrative staff to maintain the academic integrity of their university. Students are just being opportunistic, taking advantage of the luxuries of pools and water slides, conveniently located on their campus. Administration should take responsibility for the unnecessary arms race in making their university the best water park, by either regulating hours of use, and eventually allocating funding to other projects.
Lazy rivers or no lazy rivers, a university should have a strong enough academic, athletic, and social perks to encourage students to apply for their programs. If your college isn’t enough excitement and fun without a zip line and pool-centered fireplace, you’re doing it wrong.

Today, California voter support for the death penalty is at its lowest point in more than four decades, according to the L.A. Times. Since the beginning of this year, three of the country’s ten executions have been botched.
In January, Ohio inmate Dennis McGuire suffered a 25-minute suffocation. In April, Oklahoma inmate Clayton died after 43 minutes due to a heart attack from an untested drug mixture. And just last month in Arizona, Joseph Rudolph Wood gasped and snorted for almost 2 hours before finally taking his last breath.
Lili Sedano | Daily Trojan
These events, coupled with Judge Cormac Carney’s ruling that the penalty is unconstitutional in California, have rightfully put the death penalty by lethal injection under glaring scrutiny. Lawmakers must listen to voters and take the California ruling of the death penalty seriously in order to mend the system.
As with advancements in every field, practices that have been in existence for a long time should be checked. At first glance, the California ruling is astonishing considering that the U.S. Supreme Court has, in the past, upheld death by firing squad, hanging, lethal gas, electrocution and lethal injection. None of these methods of inflicting death violate the Eight Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, according to the high court. However, we can’t redefine ourselves without redefining the laws that govern us. Justice must certainly be served to every victim but the means of justice shouldn’t mean more inhumane bloodshed, as was in the case of Joseph Wood and others.
Not only is capital punishment unconstitutional in that it is cruel and unusual, but there are also multiple areas that need work.
The price tag of these executions is one such area.According to assessments by Judge Arthur Alarcon and Prof. Paula Mitchell in 2011, the cost of the death penalty in California comes up to over $4 billion since 1978. If the Governor commuted the sentences of those remaining on death row to life without parole, it would help save $170 million per year. Over the next twenty years, those savings accumulate to $5 billion.
The effectiveness of not only the execution method itself, but also the entire system, is another area that belies need for repair. Unfortunately, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, compared to states that do administer the death penalty, states that do not follow it have consistently lower rates of homicide. The gap has grown since 1990. According to these statistics, though the ultimate aim of condemning heinous prisoners with death penalty is to decrease the rate of murder in the society, the efficacy seems to be amiss.
As stated in The Economist, the average prisoner who is executed in California has spent 25 years on death row—much longer than the national average of nearly 16 years. The root of the efficacy issue seems to be that the long delays in executions fail to deter potential murderers out there. If death penalty is playing no role in influencing the minds of the criminals before they commit the crime, it doesn’t serve a point.
Yet, the victim’s family and friends should not be left out either. Most certainly, they will deserve a peace of mind after all they’ve been through. But people must understand that an eye for an eye only makes the world blind. The death penalty, in a sense, is simply based on revenge, a get-even measure that destroys people that have destroyed others. In the process, nothing is gained.
Rather than maximizing the punishment, lawmakers need to focus all efforts on minimizing the crime rate, the root of the issue. Education might be one key factor in tackling homicide. According to The Mercury, 70 percent of this nation’s prison population has failed to receive high school diplomas. Long-term research has shown that if more is invested into pre-K education, graduation rates can be boosted by as much as 44 percent and keep young adults on the right side of the law. According to a 2013 RAND (Research ANd Development) report, correctional education programs for inmates are also effective—those who participated were 43 percent less likely to become repeat offenders.
That being said, instead of investing so much into a penalty that is unconstitutional, inhumane, costly and ineffective all in one, preventive measures rather than consequential measures should pull more weight. The death penalty is a moral and financial disaster that needs to meet its own end.

It was USC’s redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler, not highly touted Oregon State gunslinger Sean Mannion, who looked like the future NFL star during the Trojans’ 35-10 win over the visiting Beavers on Saturday night.
No. 18 USC (3-1, 2-0 Pac-12) overcame some early jitters to dominate large stretches of the game, while Oregon State (3-1, 0-1) never seemed to be able to get its vaunted passing attack off the ground. The Trojans’ much maligned secondary held Mannion to only 15 completions and 123 yards, while Kessler picked apart the Beavers’ defense for 261 yards and two touchdowns. Though the win was by no means perfect — the two teams combined for a ridiculous 232 yards of total penalties  — USC head coach Steve Sarkisian was pleased with the result.
“I’m proud of our football team,” Sarkisian said. “We have room for improvement, we need to play better next week. But it’s great to be 2-0 in conference play.”
Sophomore safety Su’a Cravens foreshadowed a monster performance midway through the first quarter, intercepting a Mannion screen pass and returning it 31 yards to open the scoring. The Los Angeles native would go on to add six total tackles, a sack and another tackle for loss. The pick six marked Cravens’ first career touchdown.
“Credit to the coaches,” Cravens said. “We called a zone, we knew they wanted to get it out to the flats with their big tight ends. They ran them out and I just happened to make a play on the ball.”
Just as quickly as it arrived, however, the Trojans’ early lead vanished when OSU’s Ryan Murphy took the ensuing kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown. Murphy, who starts at safety for the Beavers, sidestepped USC sophomore defensive back Leon McQuay III while tiptoeing down the sideline for the score.
Mannion began to show off his NFL-ready arm in the second quarter, leading the Beavers on an 11-play, 72-yard drive that culminated in a field goal. The senior quarterback’s favorite target on the drive was wideout Richard Mullaney, who caught passes of 29 and 27 yards. The drive marked Mannion’s only sustained success all game, a point of pride for Sarkisian and the USC defense.
“Being disciplined was a point of emphasis for us,” Sarkisian said. “All in all I think for the entire game our discipline was very good. We were in the right places at the right times, I think we had bodies on their receivers and the windows were tight. We might have been a little over aggressive, but we did enough to make [Mannion] uncomfortable in the pocket.”
USC would respond on its very next series, converting two crucial third downs in Beaver territory to set up a 16-yard touchdown strike from Kessler to sophomore tailback Justin Davis. Davis collected 112 all-purpose yards and two total touchdowns on the night.
The Beavers’ final drive of the first half looked destined for points, until freshman Adoree’ Jackson tipped a Mannion pass into McQuay’s waiting hands in the corner of the endzone. The Beavers had moved into USC territory with the help of multiple key penalties, including a 15-yard facemask call on senior linebacker Hayes Pullard.
McQuay’s brilliance set up a wild ending to the first half. Facing 4th and 15 from Oregon State’s 48-yard line on the following drive, Kessler ran the game clock down to 0:01 before connecting with sophomore wideout Darreus Rogers for a Hail Mary-style touchdown. Senior kicker Andre Heidari’s extra point improbably made the halftime score 21-10 in favor of USC.
Kessler explained his mindset going into the play.
“I knew exactly what [Rogers] was thinking,” Kessler said. “We practice it two or three times a week, in case we get in those scenarios. Darreus made an amazing play. I really think that sparked us for the second half. It was a really big play that got the crowd pumped up too.”
Oregon State blocked a Heidari field goal attempt late in a third quarter that featured no points and a combined 20 penalties. The fireworks returned just 30 seconds into the final quarter, however, in the form of 17-yard run from redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen. The scoring play was immediately preceded by a clutch third and long conversion from Kessler, who found Agholor for a 15-yard gain while in the grasp of an OSU defender.
Davis added his second score of the day on a 21-yard run midway through the quarter, capping the 25-point win. Redshirt freshman quarterback Max Browne led the Trojans’ onto the field for the team’s final, clock-killing drive.
The Trojans will be back at the Coliseum next Saturday, facing off against No. 15 Arizona State. The Sun Devils are currently without starting quarterback Taylor Kelly, and suffered a 62-17 beatdown at the hands of No. 11 UCLA on Thursday. Still, Sarkisian knows the team will have to improve in several key areas in the next seven days.
“We’ll take it,” Sarkisian said. “We love the fact that we won. We love the fact that we’re 2-0 [in Pac-12 play]. But we can be better.”
