The topic I’m writing about in this week’s column is not very timely. I just learned of it Wednesday, and although it happened a few weeks ago on Sept. 7, it’s disappointing enough that I think it’s worth talking about. Buckle your seat belts. 
A women’s college field hockey game was stopped short so as to not interfere with fireworks before a football game. Kent State hosted a round-robin tournament with the No. 24 Maine and Temple field hockey teams. Maine and Temple faced off at 9 a.m. Saturday, and after one overtime, the score was still 0-0. But at 10:30 a.m., before they could play the second overtime, Kent State officials ordered the two teams to vacate the field so they could begin setting up the fireworks to be set off before the Kent State football game at noon. 
However, the football game was played in the football stadium, not on the field hockey field. This 10:30 a.m. hard cutoff was originally put in place by the fire marshal because the fireworks were going to be lit from the field hockey field, which is located behind the football stadium. It seems like Kent State could have easily allowed field hockey to finish their game, started the football game on time and saved the firework show for after the game, rather than before.
If you’re reading this article, I want you to pause and type “Riley Field fireworks video” into your preferred search engine. Click on the Twitter link and watch the video that Maine senior midfielder Riley Field posted of the fireworks. It will really help paint the picture of how ridiculous it is that the field hockey game was cut short for this. The Kent State Department of Athletics didn’t deem the football game to be more important than the field hockey game. They deemed daytime fireworks to be more important than the field hockey game. 
The teams tried to reason with officials, suggesting a shortened second overtime or skipping straight to a shootout. The best compromise Kent State could offer was to resume the game at 5:30 p.m. — seven hours later — for 10 minutes of play. Temple could not adjust its bus plans accordingly. Because the game could not finish, it was ultimately reclassified as a scrimmage. This was especially a shame for Temple, who went 2-16 last season, as that extra overtime would have been an opportunity for it to beat a ranked team. 
In situations like this, we should try to be somewhat understanding of the Kent State officials’ bizarre decision. In the moment, they made the decision to prioritize one of their own teams over other schools’ teams. That’s understandable. But Kent State made the commitment of hosting this round-robin tournament. The football game still could have been played on time without the fireworks, or the fireworks could have been set off after the game. The fact that their initial solution to the conflict was to cut off a field hockey game, rather than the fireworks, says a lot. 
In a statement, the National Field Hockey Coaches Association wrote that the officials’ decision was “unacceptable” and “a terrible message being communicated to female student-athletes in this year of 2019.”
Some may claim this incident is solely an issue of a money-making sport versus an unlucrative sport and that it doesn’t involve any sexism. It’s hard to say for certain, but I strongly believe that a men’s soccer game or a men’s lacrosse game — or any men’s sport, for that matter — would not have been cut short for fireworks. 
Yes, football generates more revenue for the athletics department than field hockey. However, the fact that football makes more money is not an excuse for anyone, especially the athletics department, to disrespect smaller, less lucrative sports.
“I want our players to know that their efforts and everything that they do, their training and hours of dedication and talent — that everything they do, it matters, because I think that’s what was maybe lacking this weekend,” Maine head coach Josette Babineau said. “I felt like on our team, after the game on Saturday and on Sunday, maybe there was this feeling of ‘What are we doing, and does it matter?’ That’s very sad.”
The football game could have started on time with a slight adjustment to the fireworks plan. Perhaps Kent State should have planned to set off the fireworks from one of the two neighboring football practice fields or Zoeller Field, the soccer field where no game was scheduled that day. Another solution, as I suggested before, would have been to postpone the pyrotechnics until after the football game. Besides, it is the game itself that makes money, not the daytime fireworks, so this doesn’t seem like a money issue.
Following the incident, I saw a tweet that read, “I bet those [four] field hockey fans were pissed.” Sure, field hockey has fewer spectators than football — I’ll give him that. But I would like for us to think for a moment not just about the fans, but about the players themselves. So often athletes are dehumanized, thought of as being on the field simply for fans’ entertainment, but those athletes are real people who deserve respect. 
Unfortunately it seems that, especially recently, people are so caught up in the financial aspect of sports that they forget every sport deserves respect regardless of the revenue it does or doesn’t produce. The purpose of Title IX is to eliminate discrimination on the basis of sex in any activity or educational pursuit, but it is clear that even with that law, there are some major flaws in college sports. If a college athletics department can’t respect field hockey or other women’s sports, what does that tell the public about how it should regard women’s teams? This incident isn’t about revenue; this is about football’s fireworks over women’s field hockey.
Kent State should be embarrassed about this, and hopefully this incident will cause athletics departments throughout the country to take a look at how they treat all their teams, not just the men and money-makers.

After upsetting then-No. 10 Utah last Friday, the No. 21 Trojans face another tough opponent Saturday in No. 17 Washington. The Daily Trojan spoke with the Daily UW managing editor Josh Kirshenbaum to get his insight on the upcoming game.
Daily Trojan: USC’s wide receivers dominated a supposedly strong Utah defense last weekend. How do you think Washington’s secondary will match up with USC’s talented receiving corps?
Kirshenbaum: This secondary is pretty young and new, but so far this season it has stepped up to every challenge presented. Despite so much turnover from last season — with three starters drafted and a fourth graduated — I’d say the strength of the group is its depth. Putting six defensive backs on the field has become almost the new normal for [defensive coordinator/defensive backs coach] Jimmy Lake; Washington did it pretty much all game against Hawaii’s run-and-shoot offense, and I could see something similar happening Saturday. I wouldn’t be surprised to see something similar to Washington’s performance against BYU last weekend, where the Cougars had a few shots connect downfield but also had a lot of trouble getting anything done once the field shortened.
DT: With junior quarterback Jacob Eason as well as a talented group of running backs, Washington appears to have a good offensive balance. Do you think the Huskies will rely more heavily on the pass or the run against USC?
JK: UW’s offense has generally skewed run-heavy, but this iteration may be the most balanced I’ve seen in awhile, or at least since 2016. Last weekend, Washington ran 39 run plays and 28 pass plays, and I’d guess that’s about the balance [head coach] Chris Petersen wants. The key to that on Saturday is going to be getting good yardage on first down. Washington, more than any team I’ve watched, suffers when it’s forced into obvious passing situations. As long as it can stay more balanced, I think the UW offense can have another good game.
DT: Eason and USC redshirt junior quarterback Matt Fink are both fairly new to the starting role. How do you think this will factor into their performance in this high-profile matchup?
JK: I think it’ll make a much bigger difference for Fink just because he’s the one that’s going to have to deal with the noise at Husky Stadium. This is Eason’s offense to run, and there haven’t really been any growing pains for Washington. He came in with experience playing in the SEC, and he’s got games at home and on the road under his belt this season. I haven’t seen any reason to believe he’s not completely comfortable with the offense and the environment here. 
DT: How much do you think it matters that Washington decisively defeated BYU 45-19 while USC lost to the Cougars in overtime?
JK: I think the main difference between those two games is how they started. Washington opened last weekend with a 21-point haymaker in the first quarter, while USC found itself in a close game early. Slow starts have been a problem for Washington in recent years, and when opponents can slow down and shorten games and keep it close into the second half, upsets tend to happen (see: Cal in the last two meetings). The fact that the Huskies are getting out to such fast starts, especially on offense, has been one of the most promising developments of this year’s team. That was the difference last weekend, and if Washington can do it this Saturday, it could be again this game.
DT: Which player do you think will be the biggest X factor for Washington in Saturday’s game?
JK: To start with an easy one, it’s probably junior tailback Salvon Ahmed, just on the basis that he missed the BYU game with a lingering leg injury, and if he’s back, the UW offense goes to a whole new level. Beyond injury developments, I’d say it’s junior tight end Hunter Bryant. He’s probably the most physically gifted option in the UW passing game, and through four weeks he’s quickly become Eason’s go-to option, especially on third downs. Through four games, he’s leading the Huskies with 285 receiving yards, and he’s going to present a matchup problem for pretty much anyone USC puts on him.
DT: What is your score prediction and why?
JK: This one’s tough to predict, just because I think so much of the outcome is going to be determined by what happens in the first 10 minutes or so. I’ve thought Washington was going to be in close games each of the past two weeks, and then the Huskies have dominated the first quarter en route to blowouts. I could definitely see this game getting out of hand early. Then again, I could also see USC keeping it close and staying within punching distance into the fourth quarter. I think the second option is a little more likely, but Washington ends up with just enough of a run to emerge with a 33-23 win.

Coming off an upset win over then-No. 10 Utah, USC football heads to Seattle to face its second ranked opponent in as many weeks. Now ranked No. 21, the Trojans meet the No. 17 Washington Huskies on Saturday in a critical Pac-12 matchup with the chance to move to 4-1 entering the bye week. 
The Huskies enter the game fresh off a blowout victory over BYU — the same team that beat the Trojans in overtime two weeks ago. 
USC Offense vs Washington Defense
Head coach Clay Helton announced Thursday that freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis will miss Saturday’s game. It will be up to redshirt junior Matt Fink to fill in for Slovis and carry the offense against the Huskies as he did against the Utes. 
Fink put up gaudy numbers against Utah, throwing for 351 yards and three touchdowns, but questions remain about the first-time starter’s arm strength and accuracy. 
Key to his success was his receivers’ ability to dominate Utah’s secondary. Redshirt junior Tyler Vaughns, sophomore Amon-Ra St. Brown and especially senior Michael Pittman Jr. were spectacular. Against a better Washington secondary, Fink might struggle to replicate his performance. 
The Huskies run an array of zone coverages, a sharp contrast from the man-to-man looks Fink saw from Utah. Don’t be surprised to see USC lean more on the ground attack this weekend against a Washington defense that gave up 192 rushing yards in a loss to Cal. 
Although the Trojans struggled mightily against Utah with only 13 rushing yards, they’ve shown in prior weeks that they’re capable of making plays on the ground. Redshirt junior tailback Vavae Malepeai has been consistent with the ball in his hands. Although junior tailback Stephen Carr has struggled running between the tackles, he’s still deadly on the edges. 
However, redshirt freshman tailback Markese Stepp may be the  X factor for the Trojan offense. He’s been productive in his limited snaps so far. If given more touches, he could do serious damage against a Washington front-seven that has yet to find its footing.
Washington Offense vs USC Defense
The Huskies’ offense has talent at every position, starting with junior quarterback Jacob Eason. In his first year as Washington’s starter, Eason has thrown for over 1,000 yards with a 73% completion rate, 10 touchdowns and only two interceptions. He fits throws into tight windows with regularity and displays tremendous decision-making. 
Eason has plenty of targets to work with, like senior wide receivers Aaron Fuller and Andre Baccellia — both of whom have over 200 receiving yards so far. The Huskies’ most dangerous weapon, however, is junior tight end Hunter Bryant. Bryant is one of the best tight ends in the country and leads the Huskies with 285 receiving yards this season. His route running and ability to come down with tough catches will be a challenge for USC to handle. 
On the ground, Washington fields a trio of athletic tailbacks in junior Salvon Ahmed, redshirt freshman Richard Newton and junior Sean McGrew. Although the status of Ahmed, the Huskies’ regular starter, is questionable, all three backs are explosive threats once they hit the open field. Though the Trojans did a good job containing Utah on the ground, this group could certainly do damage against a Trojan front seven that has been inconsistent against the run. 
One of the keys to this game will be that front seven’s ability to create pressure on the quarterback. After barely showing up the first three games, USC’s pass rush wreaked havoc in the Utah backfield. If the Trojans can similarly pressure Eason, they might disrupt a young quarterback who has gotten used to clean pockets through his first four starts.
Creating pressure might be even more imperative this week due to the mountain of injuries building up in the secondary. Starting cornerback sophomore Olaijah Griffin has been ruled out, as has sophomore safety Talanoa Hufanga. Though redshirt freshman cornerback Issac Taylor-Stuart will play, the Trojans have been inconsistent in the defensive backfield, and the absences of Griffin and Hufanga could be huge factors in how well USC can slow Washington’s offense.
Prediction: USC 28, Washington 35
The Trojans are talented enough to stay in this game, but with Fink making only his first start against a talented UW secondary in what’s sure to be a rocking Husky Stadium, the Trojans might fall just short. The game might hinge upon how well USC manages to run the ball and the health of its secondary. If neither of those go the Trojans’ way, it’s hard to see them leaving Seattle with a win. USC must also win the turnover battle — the Trojans can’t afford to give the ball away. A slip in momentum could be all it takes for the Huskies to win.

No. 3 USC women’s soccer faces rival No. 2 Stanford Saturday in one of the most anticipated Pac-12 matchups of the season.
USC is coming off a 2-2 overtime tie at Baylor. While Stanford has one loss and the Trojans are still undefeated, Stanford came away from last week with two solid wins over UC Santa Barbara and Santa Clara, pushing the Cardinal ahead of USC in the rankings.
For the past several years, Stanford has dominated the Pac-12 and the NCAA as a whole, winning the last four Pac-12 titles. In that time, USC has only beaten Stanford once; it came in 2016, the same season the Trojans won the national championship.  
“I think the people who have been here for a few years have really thought about the games in the previous years, and last year was really tough because we lost in overtime,” sophomore forward Penelope Hocking said. “I think we will all have that in the back of our heads … [We will] use that as motivation.”
This matchup will be critical later on in determining who will win the Pac-12 title this season. Both USC and Stanford have yet to get into the brunt of their schedule, but both have already been tested. So far, Stanford has come away with hard-fought wins over two solid teams in Penn State — who had the No. 1 recruiting class — and West Virginia, while USC defeated former No. 1 Florida State.  
Although the win against the Seminoles was certainly an important one for the Trojans, head coach Keidane McAlpine emphasized the significance of the team’s first Pac-12 match.
“There is always an excitement when you start conference season, and there’s definitely an excitement when we play Stanford, knowing that historically they’ve been at the top of the conference,” McAlpine said.
Stanford’s offense has been carried by the outstanding play of junior forward Catarina Macario, who already has 10 goals and six assists this year, including four multi-goal games. Along with USC junior forward Tara McKeown, Macario has been one of the frontrunners for the Pac-12 Player of the Year.
McAlpine said the team needs to limit Macario’s opportunities for shots on goal.
“If you can keep [Macario] playmaking instead of being the one on the [receiving] end of the ball … then you’ve got a chance to be really successful on the day,” McAlpine said.
With 7 goals and three assists already this season, Hocking will look to rival Macario’s offensive output on Saturday. She is currently on pace to top her 14-goal total from last season.
“I just have to stay true to what I know and stay confident in my own play,” Hocking said. “I have to work off my teammates and work with [McKeown] to get goals.”
McAlpine also noted that Stanford and USC match up well player-to-player position-wise. Stanford has consistently dominated opponents by overwhelming them with its offense, while USC has notched four shutouts this year.
McAlpine emphasized USC’s need to turn defense into offense.
“I like our discipline and defending, and I think that’s going to give us a chance to score goals,” McAlpine said. “It’s about limiting goals and limiting opportunities.”
USC’s backline has allowed few goals this season, but it can’t lapse like it did against Baylor, when USC allowed two goals in a five-minute period. Stanford is too good for the Trojans to make mistakes. The team must play a clean, consistent game to snap its two-year losing streak against the Cardinal.

The scene is all too familiar. A dimly lit room with freshmen and pounding music loud enough to hear throughout Greek Row. Enough alcohol to incapacitate an ox is presented to the first-years. A night of drunken debauchery and a morning of instant regret are sure to follow. 
 For decades, rituals like this have been common and expected by students wanting to pledge for USC fraternities. To prove they are worthy of being in a fraternity and having friends, pledges sometimes go through a kind of humiliating orientation, which involves hazing from senior members of the fraternity. In the past year, the University has begun a massive sting in search of misconduct among Greek organizations. According to the USC Office of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development, five fraternities have been investigated for hazing and drug abuse. Three of those five have lost University recognition. 
Investigations undertaken by the University have paired with a new policy that restricts all first-year students from the rushing process until they have completed 12 credits with a GPA of 2.5 at least. Greek organizations such as Sigma Chi and Beta Theta Pi have filed suit against the policy, saying the policy violates the right of free association enshrined in the First Amendment. Additionally, the suit alleges the University is discriminatory toward Greek life. With the case currently in review in the L.A. Superior Court, the fraternities must do one simple thing: accept those administrative investigations. 
It’s important to note that fraternities exhibit negative connotations. Where universities are bastions of academia and political correctness, fraternities seem to be the antithesis of that. There’s a reason why fraternities are stereotyped as being filled with drunk men and being dens for the hypersexualization of women — because most fraternities do actually contain such things.
For example, USC had 216 incidents in 2018 where DPS was called to The Row with connections to partying or drug-related incidents. Even more, eight USC fraternities, since 2018, have either been placed on suspension or have completely lost recognition due to hazing. But despite how dangerous some fraternities can be, the University’s deferred rush process policy is wrong. 
USC students are among the brightest in the entire nation. As a result, if some of them wish to join a fraternity and go through “hazing,” it is their freedom of association that allows them to do just that. At the same time, University fraternities must stand down because if they have nothing to hide, then nothing will happen to their status. By stirring the pot, fraternities will only prompt University officials to continue being wary of Greek life. 
Of course fraternities can taint the reputation of a university, but not all fraternities at USC conduct hazing rituals, as is the case of the law fraternity Phi Alpha Delta. Camaraderie and friendships are built through joining and participating in these organizations. The friendships last a lifetime, forming a generational connection — one that the University profits off of through its Alumni Association. Furthermore, attending an elite university often exposes one to opportunities within their field. Whether that be engineering, law, medicine or anything else, fraternities provide extensive parent and alumni networks. 
College is where individualism is cultivated within a student. Nevertheless, fraternities continue to be the microcities of controversy. One would admit that frat parties are nights filled with fun and memories, yet it is almost a guarantee that every year, fraternities and University officials engage in a tug-of-war over principles and safety. The University policy imposed on the Greek system is attached to academic merits, but it nonetheless restricts the essential freedom of people to associate with whom they wish to be associated, and therefore grow to be the person they wish to be. 
While the University policy and investigations may be antagonizing to some fraternities, the Greek organizations must not take the bait. More attention and bad publicity are the last things fraternities need at the moment after a year filled with suspensions and loss of recognition. As a result, it would be in the best interest of the fraternities to accommodate the University in its investigations. To ensure the survival of their frats, Greek life must learn to turn down the music for a while.

If watching adolescents engage in Marshall-esque competition, suffer at the hands of pesky hormones and ponder troubles more difficult than spelling the word “qaimaqam” sounds like a fun way to spend a weekend night, look no further than Musical Theatre Repertory’s upcoming student-run production of “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.”
The Tony award-winning musical opens at the Massman Theatre this Friday and is the first show of MTR’s 15th season. 
As director Tyler Ellis, a senior majoring in theatre, describes it, “Spelling Bee” follows six spellers trying to win a local high-stakes spelling competition and three adults asking themselves why they bothered to work the event — the result is pure comedic delight.
Despite the absurd premise, Ellis believes the show is relevant to USC students, including tongue-in-cheek refereneces to campus landmarks like Tommy Trojan and Parkside. 
“It’s present day,” Ellis said. “It’s not some weird period piece where people are confused … There’s USC student stuff that only we would understand.”
In addition to actor improvisation, audience participation is a unique feature of the show. Members of the audience are encouraged to sign up as “spellers” and directly interact with the performers on stage. 
“The show changes every night a great amount just because it depends a lot on the people that you call up from the audience,” said Lily Castle, a freshman majoring in theatre. 
Castle, who plays speller Rona Lisa Peretti, said she is most excited about interacting with the audience
“[I’m excited] to make snide comments about [audience members] and having to think on your feet is one of my favorite things that I’ve done so far,” Castle said.
The cast members have bonded over the story’s core message: Kids want to grow up but are unsure how to. 
“As incoming freshmen, we like to think that we’re adults,” Sam Avila, a choral music major who plays Chip, said. “But getting to come to the theater every night to rehearse and just letting all that go and becoming a kid again, tapping into what made childhood so much fun, was one of the highlights of this process.”
The score, written by “Falsettos” composer William Finn, features songs like “Pandemonium,” “My Friend, the Dictionary,” “I’m Not That Smart” and the childishly vulgar “My Unfortunate Erection (Chip’s Lament),” which all explore pubescent woes of uncertainty in identity and societal belonging. 
Ellis credited the nine-person cast as well as the crew and band, saying their common goal of creating a good piece of theater on their own has contributed to the show’s success in just three weeks of rehearsal. 
“See it for laughs, for surprising, touching moments and just to be brought back in time to when you were a kid, when the stakes were so high for something seemingly insignificant,” Ellis said.
Tickets for the show are currently sold out, but students who wish to join the waitlist are encouraged to arrive early.
