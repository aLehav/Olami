Discolored rocks and scratched-out lettering are the sole remnants of what was formerly known as the Von KleinSmid Center, marking the end of a more than five-year battle by students of color to rename the building memorializing USC’s fifth president, a known eugenicist. But it is also just the beginning for many community members, who see the change in nomenclature as a small step in USC’s long-overdue confrontation with structural racism.
The renaming of what is now temporarily known as The Center for International and Public Affairs came amid nationwide protests in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, including one held in early June on campus, and student petitions seeking accountability and action from University administration. 
Rising senior Jephtha Prempeh, who is majoring in nongovernmental organizations and social change, has been an integral part of renewing efforts to rename the building and spearheading the final push in presenting the issue to President Carol Folt. After starting a petition that demanded the president and administration acknowledge the fight against anti-Blackness, Prempeh met with fellow activists and the president on direct action that should be taken — the culmination of the years of student activism that came before them. 
Creative Experience co-director Prempeh said Folt started working on the name change months ago, although the issue of VKC nomenclature had been a focal point for student activism years before they began their studies at USC. Prempeh said they believe their meeting with the president re-emphasized how important the renaming of VKC was to the student body. This petition, along with the culmination of student activism at USC and across the country, finally led to its passage, they said. 
“I don’t think that it was my meeting by any means, but I do think that having that meeting really outlined to Dr. Folt how pressing of an issue this was to the student body,” Prempeh said. “I think it was probably a jarring moment to see that in a moment of like Black pain that the first thing that the student organizers are going to bring to her is the naming of the building … Our meeting gave her kind of the impetus to take that finalized …  to see that through to its end.” 
Jacob Pettis, a rising senior majoring in media arts and practice, said he remembers student activists seeking this change since his freshman year. Although grateful for Folt’s decision, Pettis said he feels the decision was long delayed.
“We’ve been advocating for this since my freshman year in 2017, and people were advocating for this even before I got to USC,” Pettis said. “The fact that it took this long is disheartening.”
Preston Fregia, a USC alumnus and former Undergraduate Student Government senator, said he and his peers drafted a resolution to create a task force of students and faculty that would consider the renaming of certain buildings on campus, including VKC. The Senate passed the resolution in 2018, with the drafting students facing immense opposition and death threats, and former Provost Michael Quick announced the creation of the Provost Task Force on University Nomenclature nearly a year later. Following the task force’s creation, USC administration did not reach a definitive decision regarding the name change for more than a year.  
Students initially approached the resolution through compromise and debate in hopes it would make administration more responsive, Fregia said. In a previous Daily Trojan article, former USG Sen. and presidential candidate Michaela Murphy said the resolution was meant to open up dialogue between administration and USG regarding the renaming. Murphy, along with former Sen. Noah Silver and Fregia, noted that the resolution did not call for specific action in renaming, but would establish the task force to discuss nomenclature. 
“The most important aspect of this resolution is that this is now the student body taking a stand,” Fregia said to the Daily Trojan in 2018. “I think that what everyone can do going forward is organize groups that can go and make rallies, sign petitions, and keep this grassroots movements alive.”
Fregia said although he believes the resolution he and his peers passed laid a foundation for the administration’s recent decision to rename VKC, he believes USC often utilizes task forces and committees to cause initiatives to lose momentum. 
“I do think that the administration does pursue things and makes task forces and wants you to get into a kind of compromised mindset because … they want people, the activists that are doing all this, to graduate and then slow down,” Fregia said. “They want to slow down the pace of change.”
Resistance to the name change also rose from a belief that renaming the building would erase history, according to Pettis. In her email sent out last week, Folt stated that von Kleinsmid had advanced research and academia in his field. 
“He expanded research, academic programs, and curriculum in international relations,” Folt said in the email. “But, he was also an active supporter of eugenics and his writings on the subject are at direct odds with USC’s multicultural community and our mission of diversity and inclusion.”
While creating recommendations to the USC administration on the process for renaming a controversial building, Paula Cannon, who co-chairs the nomenclature task force along with Vice President of Student Affairs Winston Crisp, said the group commented on the significance of a name’s intention — whether the decision was made under a donor’s wishes or to commemorate an honored University member. 
“We’re a very diverse community, and a name that somebody may find offensive somebody else may find is an important part of history … VKC, I think, is a bit of an outlier at the University in that I have not come across anybody who has advocated for that name to remain on that permanent building [on campus],” Cannon said. “But you can imagine the future, where reasonable people can have different opinions and so that lends itself to requiring that there is a process in place whereby a committee can be established with broad representation across the University communities.”
Despite von KleinSmid’s financial and administrative contributions to the University, Robert English, associate professor of international relations and former director of the School of International Relations, said he believes that von Kleinsmid’s racist stances negate the value of memorializing his name on campus. 
“He [held and espoused] views that are not only repugnant in hindsight from today’s perspective, but that were repugnant and inappropriate in their time,” English said. “Racism and, even worse, policies of eugenics and biological, as well as political discrimination, are abhorrent. So, I think it’s long overdue that his name be removed from our premier building that houses international relations and political science.”
Von KleinSmid’s racist beliefs are articulated in his publication “Eugenics and the State” where he called for the preservation of society on the basis that there were inferior and superior groups that should be controlled through sterilization. The Human Betterment Foundation, a think-tank von KleinSmid founded in 1928 that promoted eugenics, and its members had direct ties to Nazi Germany, influencing the ideology used to justify the Holocaust, according to a 2015 paper published in the Chapman Historical Review.
According to Fregia, sustained pressure on administration by activists and a relentless desire for change from students and the community are the main reasons USC finally agreed upon the renaming. 
“This thing would have never happened if it weren’t for the people that marched at USC,” said Fregia who also launched a petition March 2018 calling for the name change. “It wouldn’t have happened if there wasn’t protests around the country. Activism is what really pushed this over the finish line. The task force and the resolution and all this other stuff might have structured it, might have systemized it, but it was the activists that made it happen.”
USC alumna Joy Ofodu said the dedication from student activists speaks to their belief that USC can change for the better.  
“I believe, you know, if you love an institution, you should critique it and you should vocally oppose anything that threatens the credibility of that institution,” Ofodu said. “And there are a lot of aspects of USC’s administration that do threaten its credibility in saying that it’s a place that fosters diverse perspectives and multicultural perspectives while students were actively experiencing harm.”
After the USC Black Lives Matter march, students were inspired by the direct action their peers were taking and felt it was important to contribute to the cause as well. 
Win McCain, a rising senior majoring in dance, helped start a petition after attending the march that requested the immediate renaming of VKC and removal of the bust. Although he and his co-writers said they do not attribute Folt’s decision to the petition, McCain believes that the public attention and pressure on administration held them accountable.  
“Immediate, small fixes like this [are] just the tip of the iceberg of everything that needs to be fixed in order to achieve some kind of racial justice,” said Sidney Ramsey, a rising senior majoring in health and the human sciences and dance, who created the petition with McCain. 
According to Calvin Carmichael, a rising junior and Black Student Assembly co-director, an inspired and demanding student body of all backgrounds is necessary to create change on campus. 
“This isn’t an issue just held by the BSA and that BSA needs to take responsibility for in helping change the community,” Carmichael said. “This is an issue that the whole student body and … the student government has.”
In her email to the University community last week, Folt said the six initiatives she presented marked the beginning of a longer journey to combat anti-Blackness on campus. Many students hope the renaming of VKC serves as a catalyst for continued student activism on campus and amplifies the momentum of reforms from administration. 
“This is a long journey, and it’s going to take a lot of commitment,” said Folt in an interview with the Daily Trojan Thursday. “It’s a chance for us to really get a good look but start taking actions pretty precipitously with as broad involvement as possible. And if we do that, a month from now, it’ll be better, and two months from now, it’ll be better. And I think that’s the point … to keep moving forward, involving people and making actions that can get us moving ahead.”
According to Claudia Torres, a rising senior majoring in law, history and culture, the next step that should be taken is finding an appropriate and fitting permanent name for the prominent building on campus.
“I hope that they name it after somebody that’s a USC alumni, someone that is preferably part of the Black, indigenous, [or] people of color community,” Torres said. “Someone that really represents the value of what it is to be a Trojan, of what it is that USC stands for — which is inclusivity, which is about social justice, it’s about diversity.”
The nomenclature committee that was dedicated to advising administration about renaming processes no longer exists, Cannon said. The administration is now equipped to handle nomenclature debates as they arise. 
“Our task force recommended a way that that could exist — what the process could be — and also recommended the sort of overarching and guiding principles that the committee could use to look at requests for de-naming or renaming buildings or other spaces,” Cannon said. 
Although the prominent building at the center of campus no longer bears the name of the racist eugenicist, a New North Residential College building still displays the family name, memorializing von KleinSmid’s daughter Elizabeth.  
When asked about the University’s intention on looking into the renaming of the residential building, a media representative said Folt had no further comment on the issue beyond her interview with the Daily Trojan last week. 
“There are a number of buildings and things that aren’t even yet named,” Folt said in the interview. “We have an immense opportunity with naming on campus … I think it’s going to give us an opportunity to work together with students and staff and faculty and neighbors to take another look.”
Regardless of the long fight to rename VKC and the many fights to still be had, Prempeh said USC is headed in the right direction and hopes the president and administration continue to combat racism and anti-Blackness. 
“I’m not a person who’s super trusting of upper administration, especially at a super white-supremacist and very wealthy institution, but Dr. Folt has presented a very open and listening ear,” Prempeh said. “She is going to work for us, and I have a lot of faith.”

As protesters took to the streets to demand justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade and countless others who have been killed at the hands of law enforcement, Bobby Coffman was there beside them in Los Angeles. 
Coffman, a rising senior majoring in aerospace engineering, captured the energy of these moments on camera. With a click of a button, he photographed protesters on the frontlines, cop cars on fire and youth skateboarding in the street. 
“That was basically kind of what I based the little project, I would say, off of because you can see the resilience of Black culture even in times of hardship,” Coffman said. “You see these Black youth skating on a burnt-down car while police are shooting tear gas and rubber bullets at people. No matter what, the street will always belong to the people.”
The film photographer, who began his craft during his sophomore year at USC, wanted to document the experiences protesters had to go through to fight for justice. When taking photographs, he focused on capturing moments that highlighted the energy of the protest, such as protestors going head-to-head with the police while wearing face masks to protect themselves. 
“This is a very important movement for the culture, especially right now,” Coffman said. “I just kind of wanted to show everybody else what it is kind of like to be on like the frontlines of a violent protest, I would say, where things are on fire, and there’s definitely tear gas being shot.” 
Initially, Coffman did not intend to sell the photographs, but after people expressed their interest, he saw the opportunity as a way to raise money for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, a law firm that, according to its official website, “seeks structural changes to expand democracy, eliminate disparities, and achieve racial justice in a society that fulfills the promise of equality for all Americans.”
While on-the-ground protesting has been an avenue for many to get involved with the Black Lives Matter movement, Mekhla Kapoor has been unable to do so in fear of spreading the coronavirus to her grandparents. Instead, Kapoor, a rising junior majoring in computational neuroscience, has been using her love of painting to fundraise for the Black Lives Matter movement. Kapoor has never sold her own art on such a large scale before; the magnitude of the moment, however, inspired her to seek out more ways to get involved. 
“I care a lot about Black Lives Matter, and I don’t really see it as a political issue,” Kapoor said. “I wanted to do more to help towards it. I did the donations [with] what I could for my family [and] with our income and everything, but I wanted to do more.”
With every donation that she gets, Kapoor has been matching it through several contacts and organizations, such as USC Project RISHI, a nonprofit organization that leads initiatives in India and Los Angeles. 
Those who donate are able to choose between three different paintings: a cartoon character of the person who did the donation, two people holding hands and the Black Power fist. Kapoor creates the color schemes of the paintings based on the donor’s Instagram feed or their favorite colors. 
“I incorporate my own style for painting with adding flowers and a lot of nature-y stuff, so a lot of clouds,” Kapoor said. “And I’ve also added henna on a couple of the paintings like the hands since I’m Indian.”
Similar to Kapoor, Kendall Work is selling his art for the first time to collect donations. Work, a rising junior majoring in mechanical engineering, takes classes outside of his major at the Roski School of Art and Design and is selling posters of singer-songwriter Solange that he created in a digital design class. 
“I hadn’t sold posters before, but I decided it would be one of the ways in which I would be able to raise a lot of money really fast if I was able to just sell my posters and step out of my comfort zone and raise my voice to garner donations, and it ended up working out pretty well,” Work said. 
Work was initially hesitant about whether his voice would be heard, but thanks to support from family and friends, he has been able to raise more than $700 for ActBlue, an organization that splits donations between several groups fighting for racial justice. 
“I’m starting to become more comfortable just putting my artwork out for people to see because it’s been received fairly well so far,” Work said. “So I think it’s something that I can keep doing, and even if it’s not for other people, it’s something that I’ll still do for myself.”
Kevin Yin, a rising sophomore majoring in media arts and practice, has also been using his digital art skills to fundraise for racial justice. Yin has been creating commissions in order to aid in the movement as an ally, and he’s no stranger to advocacy work. In high school, Yin created graphics for student groups leading movements such as environmental protests, school walkouts and women’s marches. 
Yin is part of a campaign called #CommissionsForChange, a fundraising project originally started by Stanford University student Amy Lo. The process for getting a commission done involves submitting proof of donation, filling out a form and sending Yin one to three photos that he transforms into digital art. 
“Some people call it digital photo edits or photo art, but it’s supposedly like a collage feel,” Yin said. “You take different elements in the photos and you change them with blending layers and then other elements.”
Emily Fuesler, a rising senior majoring in art and media arts and practice, also participates in #CommissionsForChange as a way to support the Black community. From a young age, Fuesler found comfort in various forms of art. As she grew older, Fuesler knew this was the career path she wanted to pursue. 
“I’ve always sort of [wanted] to use my art to bring change to the world and to bring about escapism and to imagine sort of a better world,” Fuesler said. 
Fuesler has done similar advocacy work before; to help those who experienced stress due to the coronavirus pandemic, she designed a coloring book that doubled as a mood tracker. Now, she is creating stylized portraits for anyone who submits proof of donation to any organization benefiting the Black Lives Matter movement. 
“One of my friends nicknamed them acid portraits, so that’s sort of what I’ve been calling them,” Fuesler said. “They’re just really, like, bright and colorful and kind of trippy looking portraits of people.”
Fuesler has recently joined #CommissionsForChange and has received a positive response. So far, a lot of her close friends have submitted forms, but Fuesler hopes to expand her art activism and garner more interest. Fuesler, a Latina woman, said she wants to use this moment to uplift the Black community. 
“I think a really important part of being an ally is to understand that this is about something so much bigger than yourself,” Fuesler said. “And that you really need to educate yourself and learn and listen to other people who just haven’t been listened to for so long throughout our history.”

To help celebrate Pride Month, Arts & Entertainment staff writers have shared their favorite queer films. So whether you’re looking to learn more about the Asian American LGBTQ experience or the often overlooked history of Black queer representation in the film industry, our staff has the films for you. 
“Saving Face” 
From the same filmmaker who directed Netflix’s recent queer teen rom-com “The Half of It,” “Saving Face” was Alice Wu’s freshman debut. Released over a decade before Lulu Wang’s “The Farewell,” Wu’s queer classic centers around the first- and second-generation Asian American immigrant experience with a cast composed almost entirely of Mandarin-speaking actors.
The lesbian romantic drama is grounded in protagonist Wil’s (Michelle Krusiec) internalized fear of public and familial reprisal and the strenuous effects it has on her relationships with both her girlfriend and mother; in this way, “Saving Face” shares predictable similarities with countless other queer films that grapple with themes of self-acceptance and secrecy. Yet what sets Wu’s story apart is how it exists beyond the cliche, simplified girl-meets-girl trope — the genuity in its portrayal of the Asian American experience adds layered nuance to the internal conflict Wil faces as she struggles to reconcile her respect for traditional, Eastern cultural values with her repressed sexual orientation and Western upbringing. 
Along the same lines, I truly appreciate how ”Saving Face” doesn’t shy away from addressing the more problematic aspects of the Asian American community, adding a new dimension of representation by addressing larger cultural themes. Not only does the film underscore the cultural stigma against LGBTQ individuals and provide a brief glimpse into the colorism and anti-Black attitudes present in the community, but it also raises complex value-based debates concerning the balance between professional validation and personal indulgence, the guilt that follows straying from tradition and the extent to which we will sacrifice the self for family. 
If “Saving Face” is beginning to sound too heavy for a casual Sunday-night quarantine movie binge, fear not. Wu manages to tackle these issues in a lighthearted manner. Her accurate depictions of anxious Chinese mothers and wives reveling in gossip — comparing and disparaging their children’s careers and love lives, bickering with their husbands, making digs at American culture, fussing over shows of respect — strikes a chord with Asian American viewers and adds layers of comedy to the love story as we examine the intersectionality of culture and romance.
Through the characters’ mistakes, feelings of shame, self-doubt and fear and ultimate expressions of love, the movie emphasizes seeing our mothers as multifaceted human beings — women that exist beyond their maternal role — and glorifies the triumphs of self-acceptance.

“Foxfire” 
As someone who grew up adjacent to and in marginal contact with the Pacific Northwest, I seek out stories that utilize the lushness and gritty reality of the setting to complement the narrative. Aerial shots of rusty bridges and dilapidated houses covered with moss imbue such a sense of place for me in film that they take on an artistry nearly independent of the story. 
Discovering this specific setting during a binge of Angelina Jolie films was strange, to say the least. In between watching the shallow spy movie “Mr. and Mrs. Smith” and the unhinged spy movie “Salt,” I happened upon one of Jolie’s first features — “Foxfire.”
Shot in Portland, Ore., “Foxfire” is the exact fantasy of the Pacific Northwest I have in my head. Based on a little-known Joyce Carol Oates novel, the film centers on five high schoolers and the intricacies of their relationship.
Legs (Angelina Jolie) comes to town and immediately catches the attention of the protagonist Maddie (Hedy Burress) and her new friends. Legs pushes the group to rebel. Seemingly a straightforward setup, the “girl gang” aspect moves past cliche and forces an interrogation of the social treatment of young women. Blissfully embracing the potential of romance between the group members, the film teases some, highlights the poignancy of others and shows the difficulty of growing up in an environment averse to acceptance. 
Ultimately a coming-of-age film, “Foxfire” forgoes both the familiarity of the “coming-out” teen story (sorry, “Love, Simon”) and the pervasiveness of stories that only portray teenage girls as shallow dramatics in constant competition with each other. This choice, one that the gloomy Pacific Northwest setting greatly serves, makes the story stand as a beautiful, affecting and funny testament to the power and liberation of the “girl gang,” something the genre often forgets. 
— Quinn Soltesz, staff writer 
“Pain and Glory”
Pedro Almodóvar has continuously made an impact on modern queer cinema for decades, but nothing is more vulnerable and reflective of his own experiences than his 2019 “Pain and Glory.” This semi-autobiographical story revolves around an acclaimed filmmaker named Salvador Mallo (Antonio Banderas) trying to make sense of his previous relationships and past mistakes to develop a film before age makes him physically unable to do so.
First and foremost, the film boasts a wide spectrum of colorful scenes — some of the most elegant in recent memory. But don’t let these visuals fool you — much of the story is bittersweet. Cutting between past and present, Salvador tries to reconnect with the people he’s known over the years that he has either lost touch with or personally wronged. He finds himself in a creative crisis, and his declining health and reemerging dependency on drugs make him question if he’ll even be able to shoot another project again.
Because the narrative revolves around an older man looking back on his life, “Pain and Glory” captures a wistful mood that differentiates itself from other LGBTQ films. It reminisces on all of the obstacles Salvador has faced over decades because of his fame, upbringing and sexual orientation. I don’t want to spoil anything that happens in Salvador’s quest for creativity and reconnection, but what I will say is this: all of the scenes between Salvador and Federico, an ex-lover (Leonardo Sbaraglia), blew me away because of how well Almodóvar makes years of repressed romantic affection come to life on screen through his direction. Much of this can be credited to Banderas, too, whose performance as Salvador is remarkable.
It’s clear that this was a personal project for Almodóvar, and that sentimentality certainly rubs off on you. It is the story of a man and how he has loved, candidly weaving its way between memory and reality to convey Almodóvar’s own meditation on his sexuality. I cannot recommend “Pain and Glory” enough. It is a gorgeously introspective film that grapples with forgotten intimacy, the power of reunion (or lack thereof) and the eternal struggle for creativity.
— Charlie McCollum, staff writer 
“The Watermelon Woman”
Twenty-four years ago, Cheryl Dunye wrote, directed, edited and starred in the first feature film by a Black lesbian woman about a Black lesbian woman. Working outside of the studio system, Dunye was able to complete this autobiographical, documentary-style, comedy narrative that not only challenges the absence of Black queer representation in any film system, but also reminds us that this dearth obscures the full spectrum of identity that Black queer people have, beyond what Dunye called the “farcical, drag queeny, [or] commercial.”
That’s why we see Dunye appear in her own films so often. She talks to us, narrates her discoveries about the mysterious Fae Richards — a Black woman working in 1930s-era Hollywood and known to few as “The Watermelon Woman” — which in turn lead to discoveries about herself as she attempts to complete a biography about Richards through street interviews and oral histories. By her side is her faithful friend Tamara (Valarie Walker), steering her back to the true purpose of her project. 
Along the way, white women, including a new love interest that fetishizes Blackness, and the white lesbian gatekeepers of LGBTQ history — among those is the wonderfully named CLIT Archivist (Sarah Schulman) — attempt to change the narrative once again and erase the history of Black queerness. But, in a wonderful twist, that same history is what brings Dunye to make “The Watermelon Woman,” and it is that same absence of history that should bring any film lover to pay attention to what we haven’t seen done since Dunye’s contemplative, hysterical and cherishable project.

Weed is for gays and girls only. Sorry, I don’t make the rules.
OK, let me backtrack a little. 
Cannabis has long been emblematic of la résistance. For many generations, the government has racialized and criminalized weed, and the substance’s deliberate use in many political upheavals, such as counterculture, is not a coincidence. Even as legalization seems poised to sweep the country in the next few years, the issue of weed is inseparable from socioeconomic justice issues. 
With this in mind, it comes as no surprise that the cannabis movement and the gay rights movement were and are heavily intertwined. The most direct connection is cannabis’ use as treatment for AIDS, which disproportionately affected the LGBTQ community. Given federal and local governments’ unwillingness to acknowledge the virus’ existence and effect on a community it deemed expendable, patients with AIDS turned to cannabis for relief — both from the disease itself and the drugs they were prescribed, which were often just as harmful. 
Aside from this link, the two movements both gained ground around the same time and advocated for disenfranchised, outcast populations, working to radically shift what society perceived as deviant and delinquent. Without the intensive, dangerous labor of queer activists, weed would not be as (relatively) accessible as it is today. 
One such activist was the late Dennis Peron, who is now widely regarded as the father of the medical marijuana movement. Peron’s weed activism began in the 1970s but was greatly amplified amid the AIDS epidemic in the ’80s and ’90s. As a resident of the Castro District in San Francisco, a historically gay neighborhood, the crisis unfolded around him; when his former partner Jonathan West was dying of AIDS, he found that cannabis eased West’s nausea, depression, anxiety, pain and cachexia — or wasting syndrome. 
After West’s death, Peron threw himself into cannabis activism. He founded the Cannabis Buyers’ Club, a medical dispensary that became a hub for AIDS and terminally ill patients alike, and he co-authored and secured the passage of the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 in California, the first successful medical marijuana referendum measure in the United States.
Peron’s work was aided by fellow cannabis rights activist Mary Jane Rathbun, an ally to the LGBTQ community. Rathbun, who quickly became known as Brownie Mary, secretly distributed pot brownies to patients as a hospital volunteer for the Shanti Project, the first organization to offer medical services to AIDS patients. At the height of the epidemic, Rathbun baked nearly 600 brownies a day and was arrested multiple times, forcing her nonprofit business underground. After one of Rathbun’s testimonies following an arrest in the early 1990s, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution to make medical cannabis possession the lowest priority offense. 
Paul Scott, another activist who formed an integral part of the gay community advocating for cannabis in San Francisco, created the first medical marijuana facility in Inglewood, helping terminally ill patients cope through cannabis and support groups. Scott also helped found Los Angeles’ Black Gay Pride organization and continues to advocate for queer people of color in the industry today.
While activists such as Peron, Rathbun and Scott paved the way for greater cannabis rights, weed remains a dominant LGBTQ issue. Although queer people advocate for and use cannabis at higher rates than straight people — coexisting with queer individuals’ higher rates of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of oppression — LGBTQ leadership in the cannabis industry remains lacking. As cannabis becomes increasingly recognized as a legitimate business endeavor, corporations dominated by wealthy white cisgender men actively push queer individuals and people of color out of entrepeneurship — an insult to the communities that paved the way for cannabis accessibility.
The intersection of LGBTQ and cannabis rights is particularly relevant in southern states, where more than 60% of all Black queer men diagnosed with HIV nationally reside, according to 2014 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and where recreational cannabis use remains largely illegal and medical use is legal in roughly half the region. And, of course, it is well known that backwards legislation and restricted liberties affect disenfranchised communities, whether queer, poor or disabled, at higher rates than privileged ones — a reality that does not skip the cannabis industry.  
While queer people make up the historical backbone of the industry, we are routinely exploited, pandered to through pinkwashing or straight-up ignored. With Pride Month in full swing, we have to face yet another onslaught of tacky rainbow packaging and technicolor edibles that serve as nothing more than distractions for employers’ abysmal hiring records among the LGBTQ community. 
There’s no reason we should be begging the industry for a seat at a table when we created its infrastructure in the first place. Before weed was co-opted and whitewashed by the bigoted cishet male stoner persona, it was ours. With a purchasing power of $5.4 trillion, LGBTQ folks can and should buy their cannabis from queer-owned shops and inclusive companies where they see themselves represented.
So, to my queer friends, especially my fellow bisexual women (because, apparently, we smoke the most weed out of all demographics), keep getting smoked out by straight men for free. We deserve it.

It was 4 a.m. in Helsinki, Finland, and pitch black outside — a stark contrast to 2020 graduate Oona Wuolijoki’s bright laptop screen. At a time when many students might be sleeping, Wuolijoki, who majored in cinematic arts, film and television production, was hard at work. She was awake this early because she, like many other international students at USC, rapidly packed up her apartment in a matter of days, booked a last-minute ticket home and began taking online classes mid-March while staying with her family. 
Not only did Wuolijoki have to grapple with the time difference, but she also had a movie to produce. 
“I pretty much switched my schedule around, like my sleeping schedule, because all the post-production was happening, obviously, during the day L.A. time which is middle of the night Finnish time,” Wuolijoki said. “Because I’m the one that all of the communication flows through, I was staying up a lot.” 
All of this work was for Wuolijoki’s “Advanced Production” class, also known as CTPR 480, which is the School of Cinematic Arts’ longest-running production class reserved for students of senior standing. Designed to mimic the creation of a professional film, CTPR 480 students are assigned principal crew positions on four faculty-approved film scripts. This year’s chosen films included “Spit It Out, Margot!,” “The Order,” “You Missed a Spot” and “Strawman.” 
The class involves immense collaboration and coordination. Directors, producers, writers, editors and actors must come together to tell a cinematic story. The students involved are typically enrolled in 18 units and may have other internship or job obligations. Many students are assigned to these positions for the first time. 
Lead instructor of CTPR 480 and professor of practice Brenda Goodman knows that without a pandemic, the class is already a difficult undertaking as storytelling is not an easy task. 
“Time challenges are humongous,” Goodman said. “It’s creating art, managing time, doing all those things that, in and of itself, without a pandemic, is pretty challenging.”
A NEW SET OF CHALLENGES
Without access to SCA’s state-of-the-art facilities, including the scoring stages, recording studios, editing labs and classrooms, the 480 film teams had to overcome both technical and communication difficulties. 
Luckily, however, all of the 480 students were fortunate to have completed filming before USC transitioned to online instruction and were transitioning to post-production. 
“We have amazing technology that allows us to do so many of the functions in our business online,” Goodman said. “But how to do that collaboratively was really my biggest fear.” 
For Wuolijoki’s film, “You Missed a Spot,” one of the biggest challenges she faced as co-producer was sound editing. Since the sound editors did not have access to the SCA Foley sound stages, students had to find creative ways to execute their work from home. 
“Our sound designer … was building this home booth by wrapping curtains and clothes and just trying to get some sort of sound isolation,” Wuolijoki said. “We were not able to do pretty much any Foley for this film or ADR [the process of re-recording audio to improve sound quality]. Right now, all four films are still not in the proper theater mix.”
Director of “Spit It Out, Margot!” Ella Harris felt the challenge of balancing schoolwork while meeting class deadlines. Harris, who is majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, also said that it was difficult to keep everyone up to date without the luxury of being in the same room to disseminate information.
“Our biggest issue or biggest roadblock came just in post-production and really trying to stay focused when everything was happening,” Harris said. “Staying on the timeline was really difficult and demanding.”
With the absence of some of SCA’s in-house sound technology or image editing equipment, the wait time for uploading and transferring film clips to show drafts to project members increased. Miriam Sachs, a cinematic arts, film and television production major, writer and one of the sound editors for “Spit It Out, Margot!,” spent hours sitting at her home desk waiting for files to upload. 
“[There was] a lot of waiting for things to upload, things not uploading … spending so many hours just trying to get the film out so that the director and our producers could watch,” Sachs said. “That was probably the most infuriating part of it, to be completely honest, because normally you’re just all together in a room mixing together. But because it’s all virtual, we had to upload drafts.” 
Instead of meeting together in person, the teams had to communicate online via Zoom and other platforms to stay connected and manage time efficiently. Editor of “The Order” Yiwei Pu, who majored in cinematic arts, film and television production, remembers feeling both the strain of time management and the difficulties of communicating online. 
“Before the pandemic, we could just schedule a time to meet in the labs and just make adjustments,” Pu said. “But now, people can’t see those changes instantly. So they have to wait for the new cut to be exported and uploaded. And if it didn’t work, then we need to go back and change it and go through the same process again. So what usually takes maybe three hours in the lab will now take 10 hours or even a day because we all have other tasks and personal business that are also affected by the pandemic.” 
Co-producer of “Strawman” and cinematic arts, film and television production major Aditya Vempaty echoed Pu, stating that this abrupt transition took a toll on the traditional creative process.
“In post-production, it’s great to be able to sit together in groups and be able to watch cuts or a soundtrack or music or whatnot and be able to give feedback on it,” Vempaty said. “So just the fact that we weren’t able to do that affected [the film] a lot.” 
The separation also brought about surprising challenges. When the “Spit It Out, Margot!” team met with their professors to picture-lock — a process that involves all team members agreeing to be done with editing the frames — the group faced an unexpected distraction. While meeting via Zoom, co-producer Madison Holbrook had to simultaneously receive feedback from faculty and speak with firefighters who put out an accidental oven fire that erupted in her apartment during the meeting. 
“Usually [picture-locking is] this celebratory day where you’re all in the editing labs together,” co-producer of “Spit it Out, Margot!” and cinematic arts, film and television production major Caroline Quien said. “You have final little touches, you’re kind of working on the titles, the professor might be there with you. Instead, this was all remote. It was on Easter, we were all in different places, different time zones. When the faculty was like giving us final notes, Madison’s oven burst into flames.”
A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT
Fire or no fire, the teams grappled with perfecting their films. The spirit of collaboration and sense of community that is created among the CTPR 480 students would be difficult to maintain without in-person classes and meetings, Goodman thought. But her students shocked her. 
“These four films are fantastic,” Goodman said. “Other than missing the physical presence and maybe some things that they technically could do like sound mixing and color grading that maybe they could have done at a slightly elevated level, I’m hard-pressed to see how these films could be any better … I was really surprised and pleasantly surprised. That’s really because of the way the students just rose to the occasion.” 
The students may have pulled it off, but not without struggle. Quien said that, because of the collaborative nature of filmmaking, remote instruction led to a sense of creative and emotional distance from her project. 
“When you’re doing editing and you’re doing sound work, and you’re all in the studio together, as a team, it’s way easier to focus,” Quien said. “But if you’re just watching clips alone, you’re going to have a different experience, and it’s going to be hard to communicate.”  
Co-producer of “The Order” and cinematic arts, film and television production major Akshay Ravi affirmed that, without the luxury of face-to-face communication, coming together as a team is even more crucial. In what he called a “tumultuous school year,” supporting his crew became a top priority. 
“When we’re all separated … since the timeline for a specific work or things becomes so much longer, it becomes really important that we’re constantly checking in on each other to make sure that we’re mentally healthy,” Ravi said.
Kevin Maxwell, a graduate student and co-producer of “The Order,” felt that, with a great deal of teamwork, he believes that this year’s CTPR 480 experience has left students with invaluable lessons about the industry as it moves forward amid the pandemic. 
“One thing that it taught us as a whole is the power of collaboration, the power of flexibility, the power of clear, coherent communication and patience,” Maxwell said. “We’re not able to sit in class with each other and to react to the film. That really changed things for us and doing screenings online is a different experience. That taught us a lot about the power of cinema and the communal experience of the theatre.”
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE
The effects of the coronavirus have extended into almost every aspect of life, and the film industry is no exception. While the future of the industry remains uncertain, the CTPR 480 students believe that the production of their films equipped them for a career that will continue to evolve in a post-pandemic world. 
As protocols for filming are being worked out by the industry and by SCA, future student productions will need to adhere to public health protocols once they are implemented on campus. Currently, SCA faculty are talking with their students about scripts and stories that allow both student filmmakers and actors to work safely. 
“Production’s never going to look the same because we can’t be that close to each other on set anymore,” Harris said. “I think the exciting thing is, as we move forward, we get to be a part of that change … We get to be the ones to figure out what the new wave of this industry is going to look like.”
Director of “The Order” Ryan Zhang admitted that, at times, a film school education can be overwhelming. But, this experience, he believes, taught him the importance of empathy in the creative process and looking at film production from a broader perspective. 
“We’re just people struggling through life, and we just all care about making the movie as best as possible,” Zhang, a 2020 graduate who majored in cinematic arts, film and television production, said. “But sometimes, life gets in the way. And this is the most perfect example.” 
Although the pandemic interrupted the typical workflow of CTPR 480 production, co-producer of “Strawman” Erik He stated that the entire process reinforced his belief that, despite all the hours spent in pre-production, things will never go perfectly according to plan.
“This was such a good exercise in learning that you sometimes don’t have control … Even with everything prepared, there can be the absolute worst-case scenario,” he said. “It’s such a humbling lesson that no matter how much time you devote … ultimately, it’s not like assembly work. It really comes down to being flexible and just being prepared for absolutely anything.”

On Aug. 6 last year, then-85-year-old Tom Capehart penned a letter to USC registrar Francisco Chang. Capehart was a Rossier student-athlete more than 60 years ago but fell short of earning a physical education degree because there was still one class he had yet to complete.
“My four-year scholarship ended in 1956 when I still needed the four-unit class,” Capehart wrote. “At that time, I did not have the money to continue my education, I needed to go right to work and support my family.”
Ten months later, Capehart, now 86, penned a new letter — this time as a speech to his fellow graduates of the Class of 2020.
Born in the small town of Kingsburg, Calif. in 1934, all Capehart knew growing up was sports. His mother died when he was 4 years old and his father was hospitalized later in his childhood, leaving his high school football coach Laurence Langley and the community to raise him. His closest friends included Rafer Johnson, who would go on to become a decathlon champion in the 1960 Rome Olympics, and future 49ers and Detroit Lions coach Monte Clark.
By high school, Capehart was a four-sport athlete in football, baseball, basketball and swimming. He earned 13 varsity letters and led the basketball team to a league title during his four years at Kingsburg High School.
It wasn’t long before he caught the eyes of scouts from both the collegiate and professional levels. Among the offers were full scholarships from Stanford and USC as well as a contract from the Boston Red Sox. In the end, Capehart followed the lead of USC alumnus Langley and signed with the Trojans, becoming the first ever in his family to go to college. 
From a graduation class of just 52 to lectures holding more than 300 students 196 miles from his hometown, college was nothing short of an adjustment for the young student-athlete. 
“I can remember to this day my first class,” Capehart said. “It was, I believe, ‘Man and Civilization’ in Bovard Auditorium, and there must have been 350 or 400 students — more in the class than in my entire high school.”
The structure of college sports was different in the 1950s, with the NCAA requiring first-year student-athletes to compete on freshman teams for a season before joining the varsity squad. Capehart played under football coach Jesse Mortensen in Fall 1952, serving as team captain in the game against Stanford. 
Capehart’s athletic career began to change direction following his first football season. During one basketball game, he sustained an injury requiring surgery and a season’s recovery. While in the hospital, Capehart received the news that his dad had died. Not even a year later, he suffered a knee fracture in the season-opening football game against Washington State, and Capehart was told he could no longer participate in contact sports.
A college career without sports was impossible for Capehart, who depended on an athletic scholarship. When a teammate joked that he should try out for the water polo team, Capehart took it seriously. Coming in with left-handed pitching and swimming backgrounds, Capehart impressed the coach in a practice and scored 3 goals in his first game.
“I didn’t know the rules,” Capehart said. “I got numerous penalties called on me because I didn’t know what I should do or not do.”
Capehart stayed with the water polo team for the rest of his college career and picked up swimming as an additional sport. Even with his athletic skill, time in the pool wore on Capehart. He received the nickname “The Puker” because the high levels of chlorine in the indoor pool frequently caused him to throw up.
Capehart was also progressing on his physical education degree, but his series of injuries prevented him from taking a required four-unit course involving impact sport activity. As a senior, Capehart began taking night classes on insurance, and after licensing and growing a clientele, the goal of completing his degree was no longer attainable.
After founding Capehart Insurance Services, the former student reached out about his transcript and learned that USC no longer offered a physical education degree. So for around 60 years, Capehart remained just two units short of a diploma.
“It’s always sort of bothered me,” Capehart said. “I guess I sort of felt unfulfilled, so to speak, or maybe felt like an imposter because everybody thought I was a graduate when in fact I wasn’t.”
It wasn’t until last year that the possibility of finally getting that degree became real. When Capehart met assistant athletic director Scott Wandzilak for lunch at the Annendale Golf Club in the summer of 2019, Wandzilak encouraged him to contact current Rossier Dean Karen Symms Gallagher. Wandzilak had previously worked with athletes who were unable to finish their degree in four years and wanted to return, and he had the connections to make the transition happen.
“It was such a unique circumstance that some intern across campus had to go in the basement of one of the libraries to find his records and all these different things,” Wandzilak said.
After the letter to Chang and months of coordination with Student Academic Services, Capehart was matched with assistant professor Dr. Angela Hasan for a directed research course in the spring. 
Hasan first suggested Capehart complete the course online in January to avoid a commute from Pasadena. But Capehart insisted on meeting in person and showed up every week to USC’s City Center campus in a sport coat and tie to work one-on-one with his professor for more than four hours. 
What began as a course studying the biographies of famous athletes turned into an internal study of Capehart’s own story. Hasan, who has been at USC for more than 11 years, was floored by her student’s performance.
“He had a lot of data to go through,” Hasan said. “He recorded hours of conversation that he even went back and transcribed and edited himself just in terms of reflections on his own thinking.” 
The expectation for the autobiography assignment was set at around 30 pages. Capehart finished with 200. 
His research in the classroom extended to topics beyond his own life. Capehart often arrived early and stayed after the class’ allotted time to speak with students about their studies, careers and home lives. After a semester with Capehart, Hasan saw firsthand what the University meant to its alumni.
“Throughout the years, even though he’s coming back now to finish this degree, he’s always associated still USC as kind of being an extended family,” Hasan said.
Wandzilak believed Capehart should tell his story to the class he was graduating with. Once his coursework and degree eligibility were confirmed, Wandzilak reached out to graduation coordinators and then asked Capehart to be a speaker at the student-athlete ceremony. 
“He wanted to redo the speech over and over again because it was never good enough for him,” Wandzilak said.
On May 14, Capehart shared his story during a virtual graduation ceremony. A day later, he became the literal definition of a graduating senior 64 years after first becoming a Trojan.
His speech was simple, spread across seven double-spaced pages in large font. After a bulleted list of five life lessons, Capehart shared his final observation as a USC student from his Pasadena home.
“Remember, a winner listens, and a loser can’t wait for his turn to talk,” Capehart said. “And with that, I’m outta here!”

To say that last Wednesday was a historic day for USC football and the Athletic Department would be quite the understatement.
On June 10, USC ended its disassociation with one of the most dynamic college football players ever in Trojan running back great Reggie Bush, the same day that the NCAA’s mandated 10-year disassociation between the University and Bush expired. Athletic director Mike Bohn made it clear the University wanted to end the disassociation the very day it was permitted to do so as a sign that Reggie was unequivocally back — as if he had never left. 
“I’ve dreamed of this day for 10-plus years, and I’m excited to come home!” Bush said in the USC Athletics press release announcing the decision. He later added in an interview with Colin Cowherd on The Herd that the decade-long disassociation period had been a difficult one; he struggled with self-confidence issues and had to deal with plenty of backlash during his 11-year NFL career after he and USC were levied some of the harshest sanctions the NCAA has ever imposed. And it’s hard to blame him — Reggie was the man at USC, and all of a sudden, he was ostracized from the school where he became one of the greatest players in college football history. Understandably, that experience took a toll. 
But now, he’s back, and presumably, much of that weight — though perhaps not all of it — has been lifted off of his shoulders. As it pertains specifically to USC fans, though, let’s be totally honest: Not much about that particular era of USC football had ever changed. 
The NCAA’s sanctions — vacated wins, postseason bans, scholarship losses — didn’t change the fact that USC had college football’s most dominant team from 2003 to 2005. Trojan fans will claim the 2004 BCS National Championship to the grave and don’t give two shits what anyone else thinks. Bush’s Heisman Trophy forfeiture in 2010 didn’t change the fact that his 2005 season was one for the books. I’ll try to make this as cheesy as I can because I know no better way to put it: The record books may have been wiped clean, but the memories persist. And besides, last Wednesday didn’t formally restore any chapters in said history books anyway. 
OK. So what now?
At least from the look of things, Reggie seems to be all in on his return to USC. And in the interview with Cowherd, a consistent theme emerged: He wants to Make USC Gr — no, no. Not that. Let’s word that differently: Bush wants to help re-create the USC program that once expected a Rose Bowl appearance at the bare minimum year in and year out. 
There are many ways to do that, of course, and — warning, unpopular opinion — many of those don’t require the removal of the Trojans’ current head coach. (That’s for another column.)
If USC football wants to become the elite program many Trojan fans are accustomed to, and if it wants to let Reggie be a part of that transformation, it’ll allow Bush to become one of the most impactful recruiters the school, the conference and the country have ever seen.
Think about it this way: USC can throw the old adages at top prospects all it wants, and I’m sure it’s already doing that: “Look at all our championships, check out all our Heismans, examine all our draft picks,” yadda yadda yadda. It carries a certain weight; USC does have plenty to offer in terms of player development that holds true even in the presence of that aforementioned head coach. Offensive coordinator Graham Harrell, cornerbacks coach Donte Williams or even head coach Clay Helton can say those things and they’ll present a strong case for five-star recruits and NFL hopefuls to don the cardinal and gold. 
But a beefed-up recruiting staff can only get the Trojans so far. And if those words are instead coming from Reggie freakin’ Bush? That weight is much, much heavier. It’s hard to ignore the persuasion of a guy who became the co-face (see: Kobe Bryant) of Los Angeles sports while he was there. Coaches and recruiting personnel can promise elite high school students hypotheticals: “Look at what we can do for you,” while Bush can testify from personal experience: “Look at what they did for me.”
This isn’t to say that I’m only glad Bush is a Trojan again because USC can use him as a tool to haul in the Korey Foremans of the world; the connection is much more personal. He should be publicly and officially celebrated as the USC legend he is, he should get his Heisman back, he should be led to the 50-yard line for a standing ovation during every quarter break of every USC home game for the next 20 years. The Athletic Department should give Bush as much time as he wants to reacclimate to the campus and the University — after all, it’s been 10 years apart.
But Bush made it clear that he wants to help bring USC back to the promised land, and there are tangible ways to do that. If Helton and Bohn’s aspirations are similar, the Trojans must recruit, recruit, recruit — and bring Reggie along every step of the way.

A Trojan Grounds Starbucks employee has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a communitywide email sent by the Department of Public Safety Tuesday. The individual last worked Thursday, and employees who were potentially exposed are advised to self-monitor for symptoms.
The Starbucks undergoes a daily cleaning regimen, which includes sanitizing surfaces about every 30 minutes, according to the email. The location will receive an “enhanced cleaning” Tuesday. 
In the email, DPS reiterated that students, staff and faculty should limit community transmission of the coronavirus by continuing to follow public health guidelines, including wearing a face covering in public, practicing social distancing and washing hands regularly. Students and employees who develop symptoms of coronavirus infection should self-isolate, report their illness to Student Health, submit to testing and stay at home.
The email was sent in compliance with the Clery Act, which mandates that universities disclose campus-related statistics and criminal incidents. The email also included an attached memo in Spanish.
The University did not comment on the incident in time for publication.

While the School of Cinematic Arts prides itself on having a diverse student body, it does not take students of color like myself long to notice how the school reflects the systemic racism deeply ingrained in the film industry.
The excitement of getting accepted to the world’s top film school is quickly hindered the moment we walk into SCA, knowing that we have to fight to make our voices heard.
During the first semester, SCA requires its graduate production students to take a “Cinematic Ethics” course with a required diversity and inclusion lab as part of its initiative to “change the industry.” While the diversity lab does address a few important issues, it falls short in a big way: It often serves as a platform for white students to debate whether or not it is OK for them to capitalize on the pain of minorities by telling stories that are not theirs in order to climb the ranks of the industry.
In short, SCA profits millions of dollars from a class that, frankly, ought to be a workshop for its predominantly white faculty rather than its students.
The main issue that frustrates production students of color, myself included, is that the staff and faculty do not accurately reflect the diversity of the student body — which is not even that diverse to begin with.
I can count the professors of color that have taught me during my three years at SCA on one hand — and that’s coming from a student who actively sought out professors of color.
On the first day of our graduate orientation, we were introduced to the program by the dean, who remarked that “the person next to [us] will be the one who hires and fires [us]” – an accurate representation of how SCA hires its predominantly white faculty by exclusively hiring their friends and collaborators.
Every section of all intermediate and advanced courses across all disciplines is exclusively taught by white faculty.
As graduate students, we are also required to complete an advanced project in order to graduate — this is known throughout SCA as our calling card to the industry. Each semester, only three projects pitched by student directors are selected from the entire graduate program, for documentary and fiction each. The selection process for both documentary and fiction is determined by the faculty teaching the courses, all 14 of whom happen to be white.  
Getting chosen to direct one of these projects at one of the world’s most selective film schools is extremely competitive. Even if we decide to independently fund and direct our own advanced project, we still have to apply and get selected by an all-white faculty.
Having taken the advanced production documentary class twice — as a director and as a producer — I can tell you that the faculty have much to offer to their students. They are extremely supportive, accomplished and very sensitive to our experiences and stories. However, not having a single documentary professor of color in such an esteemed film school is extremely problematic; it limits our opportunities to work with professionals who would be able to empathize with our experiences on a more profound level.
While some of our white peers often complain that a spot is “reserved” every semester for a “diverse student” to direct, the fact of the matter is that not a single semester has gone by without a white director selection since the birth of the program. Diversity at SCA often feels like a brush with one shade: It boxes all students of color into one category, forcing them to compete for that “one spot” in order to meet an unspoken quota.
Even when we get selected, our hard work is often discredited as a diversity selection — a salient reflection of the industry’s entitlement to only tell white stories. Moreover, when we are faced with direct instances of racism, our point of contact — SCA interim Assistant Dean of Diversity and Inclusion Evan Hughes — is white.
Despite good intentions, our white faculty cannot understand our stories, our perspectives or our experiences. From the scripts we have to rewrite to the microaggressions we begrudgingly laugh off, students of color navigate the program differently than white students. Before I even enroll in any class at SCA, I often have to do my research on whether the professor teaching the class has political views that perceive me as lesser.
Bringing up these issues is often seen as a threat to the white entitlement to tell stories, run universities and monopolize industries. By not offering a diverse range of professors, SCA perpetuates an environment of inequality and further encourages the white supremacy that already runs rampant in Hollywood. 
For a healthier and more inclusive option, SCA’s administration must hire faculty and staff members that are not their friends and collaborators — a small but significant step toward fixing the deeply rooted systemic racism that SCA can no longer ignore.
Until then, SCA isn’t the change — it’s a big part of the problem.

“Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling’s most recent viral transphobic tweet and essay show why minor linguistic nuances can significantly impact the general population’s mindset around the LGBTQ community. 
In the post, Rowling made fun of an article on period poverty during the pandemic for using nongendered terms to refer to “people who menstruate.” 
“I’m sure there used to be a word for those people,” Rowling wrote facetiously. “Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?”
Rowling has publicly voiced her trans-exclusionary radical feminist beliefs, better known as TERFism, before; in late 2019, she tweeted support for a woman who lost her job in the United Kingdom after posting and reposting bigoted comments about transgender and nonbinary people on her social media. Rowling and many others subscribe to an anti-transgender branch of feminism that argues equality for transgender people will take away from women’s rights. 
TERFs such as Rowling deliberately misgender transgender people and view transgender women as men, stifling the transition to widespread use of gender-neutral language when discussing periods, pregnancy and other topics typically associated with women. 
This particular strain of resistance is rampant in the United States, too. Last year, when Berkeley announced it would adopt gender-neutral language in its city codes, such as saying “firefighter” instead of “fireman” or “artificial” rather than “man-made” and replacing all uses of “men and women” with “people,” the internet erupted. Headlines from many news outlets focused on the city’s replacement of the term “manhole” with “maintenance hole,” leading many a Twitter user to chime in online about the “PC left” being too worried about the gender implications of a manhole cover. 
In reality, the city changed about 40 terms, showing that it’s possible (and not that hard) to officially do away with gendered language to make women and nonbinary people feel more included at the institutional level. 
A set of experiments conducted in 2019 among about 3,400 Swedish adults sought to investigate the impact of formally incorporating gender-neutral pronouns into the language. The results showed that language affects gender role perception and LGBTQ acceptance. Researchers found that using gender-neutral pronouns made people more likely to view women and nonbinary people on an equal playing field to men and more readily accept those who identify as LGBTQ. 
Unlike what Rowling and other TERFs believe, adopting and normalizing gender-neutral language doesn’t erase women’s rights or experiences. Instead, it helps mitigate biases toward women and the LGBTQ community.
Kids growing up are often told that words can only hurt if we let them. That “sticks and stones” mentality glosses over the impact language can have on our perception of ourselves and others. Accepting and proactively endorsing gender-neutral language, as Berkeley did in its city code and period product companies are working toward, will only help more women and LGBTQ people be seen as equal with cisgender men (both by themselves and by others). 
There are more pressing issues facing LGBTQ people. The Trump administration recently stripped Obama-era reforms that protected transgender people from discrimination from hospitals, doctors and the health care industry. Despite the Supreme Court’s recent ruling that anti-discrimination laws do indeed apply to LGBTQ workers, transgender people continue to face discrimination across health care, employment and housing. Especially considering that this transphobic pushback is occurring during Pride month, it becomes all the more important to take the simple step as allies to combat this systemic bigotry by implementing progressive rhetoric and inclusive language in institutions and everyday life. 
Adopting gender-neutral language is a simple, immediate change that all institutions can put in place to eliminate biases against women and LGBTQ people. It’s a small step that will receive pushback from folks like Rowling, but it could also help change the general population’s mindsets and attitudes so that more people fight for acceptance and equality.
