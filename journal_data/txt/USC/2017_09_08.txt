Matt Boermeester, the former kicker expelled from USC, cannot return to campus, a court ruled on Friday. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Amy D. Hogue stayed the expulsion, but ruled that Boermeester would not be allowed to re-enroll at USC or return to the campus until further notice.
A trial on the petition filed by Boermeester’s attorney asking for Boermeester’s expulsion to be reversed and for his reinstatement at the University will be held on Jan. 3. 
Boermeester was expelled and removed from the campus in July, after a USC Title IX investigation ruled that he had violated the student code of conduct following an alleged violent altercation with his girlfriend, fellow USC student Zoe Katz, in which he was accused of placing his hands around Katz’s neck and pushing her against a wall at least twice around midnight on Jan. 21.
Katz wrote a letter through her attorney in July calling Boermeester’s expulsion unfair to both parties, and she denied ever being abused, assaulted or mistreated by him. Katz added that she was intimidated by USC’s Title IX office.
But in her initial statement to Title IX investigators, revealed in a USC court filing last month, Katz said that she would often have bruises on her legs and arms because Boermeester would “hit her or grab her tightly when he was angry.”
The court ruling comes a day after Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos used Boermeester’s case as an example in her plans to roll back Obama-era Title IX regulations that she claims are unfair toward those who are accused.
“The young woman repeatedly assured campus officials she had not been abused nor had any misconduct occurred,” DeVos said during a speech at George Mason University in Virginia. “But because of the failed system, university administrators told her they knew better.”
Shortly after the ruling, Provost Michael Quick sent out a memorandum reinforcing the University’s commitment to the mission of its Title IX office. 
“In light of recent news about suggested revisions to federal guidance under Title IX, I want to reassure our campus community that we will continue to take seriously our responsibility to handle sexual misconduct on our campuses,” Quick wrote. “It simply cannot be overstated: this university will not tolerate sexual misconduct in any form, whether it is sexual violence, abuse, stalking, intimate partner violence, harassment, or discrimination.”
Though Quick did not directly address either the Boermeester case or DeVos’ comments, he defended the procedures used by the Title IX office and spoke to their role in preserving the rights of all parties involved.
“Over the past several years, we have worked hard to create standards and processes that are fair and protect the rights of all parties, but which have serious consequences for those who are found responsible for violating USC policy,” Quick wrote. 
Boermeester, a redshirt junior placekicker on the football team last season, kicked the game-winning field goal in the Rose Bowl in January.

As she chuckled at the irony of the situation, Thuy Thanh Truong confessed her shock when she received the news in September of last year.
“I was like, what? How is that even possible? The person who goes to the gym every single day and doesn’t even smoke,” Truong said.
She initially went to the doctor for back pain and had planned a meeting later that day. Even after the diagnosis, she had no intention of missing it. After she presented, they spoke about moving forward with the project, but she trailed off, contemplating what she had just heard from her doctor: Stage 4 lung cancer.
Born in Vietnam, Truong immigrated to the United States in 2003 with her parents to pursue her education. After graduating from USC in 2009 with a bachelor’s degree in computer science, she moved back to Vietnam against her parents’ wishes to continue her career as an entrepreneur. Now at 32, she’s already been deemed “Vietnam’s startup queen” by BBC and featured in Forbes Vietnam’s “30 under 30” list.
On the day of her diagnosis, Truong recalls speaking to her cousin, a surgeon.
“He said, ‘If you’re going to stay in Vietnam, you’re going to go for more procedures here,” Truong said. 
She recalls how she replied decisively, “No, let me go back to the U.S.” 
Two weeks later she was at the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center in Los Angeles beginning her treatment.
“You just want to be at a place where you feel at home, and USC Norris feels like my home,” Truong said.
 During her undergraduate career at USC, Truong founded Hackathon at the University of Science at Vietnam National University, an event for tech students to network and show off their app-building skills. After graduation, she went back to Vietnam and immersed herself in various business ventures to hone her entrepreneurship experience.  
Today, Truong continues to formulate dynamic enterprises which make an impact while she undergoes treatment for lung cancer. She and Peter Kuhn, a USC professor of medicine and biomedical engineering, developed an initiative for another Hackathon, Hack for Health,  this time with cancer resources in mind. She credits her motivation for the event to the uncertainty of what the future held.
“I used to spend two years developing an app, but I don’t know how much time I have left, so instead of developing 20 apps in two years, I’ll develop 10 apps in two minutes,” Truong said.
Truong is also working with a team of volunteers for her recent non-profit program, Salt Cancer Initiative, designed to bring support to cancer patients in Vietnam. The lightbulb for SCI went off while she was taking a yoga class during her treatment at USC Norris.
 “When I first got diagnosed, I went to the class every week and got inspired by the teacher and the class,” Truong said. “I thought, I wish that they had a class like that for cancer patients in Vietnam.”
Today 100 SCI volunteers host monthly meet-ups throughout Vietnam for patients, weekly yoga classes at upscale fitness clubs and coloring, singing and drawing activities for children battling the disease in hospitals — each owned or organized by USC alumni.
With the average salary in Vietnam less than $2,000 annually, the membership fee to the fitness club where SCI hosts yoga classes for patients is higher than what most people can afford. Truong said she chose this club in particular not only because it was owned by a USC alum, but also because of its state-of-the-art facilities.  
“It’s something very few people in Vietnam have experienced before,” Truong said. “Because they have cancer, we don’t know how much time they have left. They could have three months left, six months left, three years left. It doesn’t matter — I want them to experience something they’ve never experienced before.”
Truong’s roots are strong in Vietnam; after graduation, she returned to start her first company, a frozen yogurt shop. The shop lasted three years and expanded to five stores, but Truong eventually shut down the company, citing lack of experience. 
Truong didn’t, however, let her first unsuccessful business run slow her down, and quickly switched gears to her next venture.
In 2013, she and a former classmate from USC developed GreenGar, a mobile application and development team that created the popular application Whiteboard, allowing users to work collaboratively from various devices.
GreenGar became the first company in Vietnam to be accepted to the 500 Startup Accelerated Program in Silicon Valley, but after a year of not being able to fundraise and scale up the business, Truong went back to the drawing board to start her third company, Tappy, a social messaging app.
Tappy quickly rose to success when it was bought by Weeby.co, a cloud-based game building software in Mountain View, Calif., for a seven-figure sum. Truong stayed involved with the company for more than a year before she became restless for yet another new experience. She decided to leave for a two-month solo road trip across the U.S., from California to New York, visiting national and state parks. 
It was after the cross-country trip that Truong received her lung cancer diagnosis. 
Truong is currently undergoing treatment for a target drug she qualified for after DNA testing at USC. If the drug is not effective, she will soon begin chemotherapy.
“I have the Trojan Family who support me in everything I do,” Truong said. “It’s a real family. Once you’re a Trojan, you’re Trojan for life.”
When discussing the fight ahead of her, Truong references the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who accomplished debatably his most esteemed work while being treated for cancer before his death.
“There are a few things that the world wants to have before they take me away,” Truong said. “I don’t know what it is yet, but I hope for the best.”
 
As another young person with lung cancer, I appreciate the coverage of Truong.  #fighton

The USC Gould Immigration Clinic will provide financial and legal assistance for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients looking to renew their work permits.
The Immigration Clinic put out an “Urgent Message to DACA Recipients” on Thursday, encouraging undocumented USC students, employees and their family members with DACA work permits that expired after Sept. 5 and before March 5 to renew them. 
President Donald Trump issued an order Tuesday that will terminate the DACA program, an Obama-era policy that gave renewable two-year periods of deportation relief and work permits to undocumented immigrants who entered the United States as minors.
The order’s enforcement will be delayed for six months, but immigrants currently under the program can renew their permits and retain their legal status for up to two years if their permits expire between Sept. 5, 2017 and March 5, 2018, according to Immigration Clinic Director Niels Frenzen. 
“[They are] allowing people whose current DACA work permits expire between [Sept. 5 and March 5] — a 30-day period to file for a DACA work permit renewal,” Frenzen said. “Normally, they wouldn’t be thinking about filing to renew … until January or February, but they only have until Oct. 5 to file to renew if they want to have their two-year extension.”
If DACA recipients don’t renew their permits before Oct. 5, they will lose the ability to work legally in the United States and will lose their deportation protection, Frenzen said.
The Gould Immigration Clinic will provide legal assistance to DACA recipients to help them complete applications and file them before the deadline, but Frenzen also stressed than any non-citizen immigrants should consult the clinic about their legal status and potential path to citizenship.
“The basic thing we’re suggesting to anyone who’s an immigrant is to come in, sit down with one of our attorneys, and we will identify whether you have any options to get legal status,” Frenzen said. “In some cases, we identify a possible form of relief that they were unaware of. If someone has a path to citizenship, we’ll assist them with that, or give them a referral as appropriate.”
According to the email, USC is also providing financial assistance for both undergraduate and graduate students who need help paying to renew their DACA work permits. 
Frenzen said funding for the financial aid is in part coming from the Undergraduate Student Government, which allocated $10,000 for DACA students’ renewal fees Tuesday night.
The renewal filing fee for the permits is $495, and the message urged individuals to not delay their renewal applications because of financial reasons. 
Frenzen said that paying attention to developments in immigration policy is important for any non-citizen in the United States, so they know about actionable changes, such as the Oct. 5 renewal deadline. 
“Things could change,” Frenzen said. “I have no reason to believe that the shutdown of the DACA program is going to change, but Trump sent out a tweet [yesterday] that is a strange tweet — one interpretation would be that he might give serious consideration to restoring DACA within six months.”
The tweet, which President Trump published on Thursday, read: “For all of those (DACA) that are concerned about your status during the 6 month period, you have nothing to worry about – No action!”

Cathy Liang | Daily Trojan
The Latina/o Student Assembly organized a protest on Thursday night next to Tommy Trojan in defense of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an Obama-era immigration policy which guaranteed temporary legal status to undocumented childhood arrivals.
Hundreds of students came out to voice their opposition to President Donald Trump’s decision to rescind the policy. The protesters wielded posters with messages such as “Resist” and “Defend DACA.”
Karen García, executive director of the LSA, galvanized the audience early with some chants. She shouted, “When DACA is under attack, what do we do?” The crowd responded, “Stand up, fight back!” Later in the rally, the crowd excitedly cheered “Sí se puede,” the Spanish equivalent of “Yes, it is possible,” or “Yes, we can.”
García offered other words of encouragement and advice. 
“I hope everyone is just as outraged as I am,” García said. “We are going to fight. We are going to stand up together and do this with you … Passivity is not an option.”
Jesus Carreon, a freshman studying law, history and culture, is a DACA recipient and member of the LSA.
He explained how important DACA is to the Southern California community. 
“People don’t quite get how much DACA means to us,” Carreon said. “DACA is our source of income, in a way, because those are our work permits.”
Carreon said that without DACA, undocumented California residents will have to pay out-of-state tuition to University of California schools should they choose to attend one, and would no longer be entitled to many government benefits and forms of assistance.
García said that many fellow LSA members have been affected by the recent DACA decision. 
“At our LSA meeting on Tuesday we opened up with a couple questions like: ‘Who’s first gen[eration]? Who’s a child of immigrants?’” García said. “One of the last questions was: ‘How many of you are affected or know someone who is affected by the DACA program?’ And everyone raised their hands.”
García also praised Undergraduate Student Government for passing a proposal earlier this week allocating $10,000 to help students pay for their DACA renewal fees. 
“I’m actually really proud of USG for being so reactive to the situation,” García said. “The fact that the decision was announced on Tuesday [by Trump] and USG voted to allocate $10,000 that same day represents a huge step for USG … I am very much proud to be a part of USG this year.” 
Senior Cindy Cox, an assistant director for LSA, also praised USG’s action in support of DACA recipients.
“I think it was really powerful,” Cox said. “USG is supposed to represent the student body and that’s exactly what they’re doing.”
García added that in the uncertain political climate, LSA’s goal will remain the same: to give a voice to those who need one. 
“LSA is committed to representing underrepresented communities,” García said. “I definitely do encourage anyone to come out to LSA meetings and reach out to us, either me or Cindy. We will do anything in our power to help them out.”
While García applauded USG’s funding of DACA students, she also said that it should serve as a first step toward more support for DACA students. 
“This is a good start but we need to keep pushing,” García said. “And we need to look for other resources for assistance.
Cox said she hopes the support for DACA students will continue and grow at USC.
“I think this was a wake-up call for the University,” Cox said.
 
Sadly, Trump’s contentious issue is yet one more thing that makes being an international student away from home difficult, on top of our already complex culture and language. Assimilation assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on their life’s journey. Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow students, and even informative books to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.
   An award-winning worldwide book/ebook that might be of help to anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” Used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors, it  identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they’ve contributed to our society, including students.    
   A chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture, friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work with/for an American firm here or overseas. 
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here. 
   Good luck to all at USC or wherever you study or wherever you come from, because that is the TRUE spirit of the American PEOPLE, not a few in government who have the loudest voice!

Rachel Atherly | Daily Trojan
On Monday, USC President C. L. Max Nikias released a letter to the student body declaring his support for undocumented students and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Act, a policy established by former President Barack Obama to protect undocumented children that President Donald Trump has recently announced he will rescind.
“As president of one of the most global and diverse university communities in the world, I am deeply concerned about the adverse impact that potential DACA changes might have on our DACA and undocumented students,” Nikias wrote. “We are enriched every day by the presence and contributions of our students from all backgrounds in our classrooms, labs, residence halls, and campuses.”
USC is a prominent stakeholder in the conflict surrounding DACA. The Daily Trojan reported in 2016 that the Financial Aid Office works with as many as 46 undocumented students — though many more could attend USC without voluntarily revealing their identity. As part of the effort to support DACA recipients, USC has taken decisive action — offering financial assistance with the $495 renewal fee and extending legal assistance to USC students, employees, contract employees and famlies of USC students. 
Last year, the University also took an equally decisive stance in response to Trump’s attempted travel ban on Muslim-majority countries. As an immigrant himself, Nikias has identified the issue of protecting access to higher education and equal opportunity for Americans of all backgrounds, races and ethnicities as a personal one to him.
USC directly engaging itself in political discourse is a decisive break with precedent. This is an important step for USC, which has largely stayed out of political debate in the past.
The DACA decision and the travel bans provided USC — a private institution — with good reason to step into the political fray. The University spoke up on behalf of a group of marginalized students who need powerful institutions, now more than ever, to support them, and USC acted as one of these institutions. For that, we should applaud the University. 
However, this should not be a one-time grandstand. Universities are political by nature and thus, USC should use this as a first step in standing up for the political issues that affect the most vulnerable sects of the student body.
In the past, USC has remained silent on many issues of identity-based oppression affecting students, ranging from the defunding of Planned Parenthood, to racially charged police violence, to — more recently — the Department of Justice’s announcement that LGBTQ people will no longer be a protected class under Title VII, USC failed to issue statements standing with affected students.
Affordable access to contraception, pregnancy tests, STI tests, breast cancer screenings and a number of other reproductive health services allows female students to have the same educational and professional opportunities as their male peers. The threat of discrimination and even violence from our institutions weighs heavily on LGBTQ and minority members of USC’s student body, and can also limit the opportunities they will be able to pursue.
As an elite institution of higher learning, USC has an obligation to position itself at the forefront of the nation’s political dialogues, especially where the livelihoods of marginalized members of the Trojan Family are concerned. It is critical that USC raise its voice and be proactive — especially amid its crusade to solidify a legacy of global leadership — when it comes to DACA and other identity-based political issues going forward. At a time when politics and higher education have become inextricably bound and silence on politics further marginalizes Americans who lack the resources to stand up for themselves, not taking a stance on these issues is simply not an option anymore. 
The policy proposals emerging from this U.S. presidential administration could stand in the way of students accessing equal education, and USC’s words bear just as much weight as its silence. The University has the responsibility of not only shaping today’s dialogue around its students’ rights, but also doing everything it can to protect its students’ rights. Without a student body of diverse backgrounds and experiences and without their unique contributions, USC’s chances of emerging as an Ivy League-tier university will deteriorate. 
USC senior administration’s swift response to the threat to DACA — in which Nikias outlined resources available and described his own immigrant journey — must be a model for future responses to political decisions that can have a real impact on USC students. 
But further, it is absolutely crucial to support students affected by devastating political decisions, and it is equally as important to understand that discrimination and threats to diversity do not only manifest in instances thrust under national spotlight. Challenges to diversity and equality exist everywhere in our institutions, and silence enables and strengthens them. Standing up for DACA students should be the start, not the end, of USC’s public support for marginalized communities.
Daily Trojan Fall 2017 Editorial Board
 
ICE could arrest and deport every single undocumented alien on campus and USC would still be “one of the most global and diverse university communities in the world.”  Condoning illegal immigration is no different than accommodating test cheaters or essay plagiarists.
It would be a shame if USC put itself at the forefront of all identity politics as the authors wish.  USC is a school of higher education — not a special interest lobby.  Let’s hope it stays that way.

On Thursday, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced her vapid eagerness to rescind former President Barack Obama’s Title IX guidelines — measures that were necessary to ensure both women and men retained their civil and human rights in the wake of sexual assault. These were incremental changes that positively contributed, but stopped far short of solving what remains an endemic problem across all American universities. Of course, DeVos’ heedless commitment to dismantling almost every piece of common-sense, Obama-era educational reform — from regulations on for-profit colleges to a path to more affordable higher education — is nothing new; to say DeVos is a grossly unqualified and incompetent Secretary of Education is also repetitive, though necessary. What remains to be said, however, is that actions like these truly represent a different sort of crisis in American government: the inability of the Trump administration to represent any sort of leader in American cultural progress, national solidarity or moral principle.
I won’t waste time outlining the dire necessity of sexual assault reform and Title IX guidelines to a student body largely aware of these concerns. Nationally, however, sexual assault is on the rise; this University’s statistic is itself higher than the national average, and the vast majority — perhaps nearly the totality — of cases go unreported. Most women who report having experienced some form of sexual assault also report they were afraid to go to authorities. Our own Secretary of Education — the one their taxes bankroll — just took drastic steps to confirm and enforce those fears. 
Let me make this very simple: Betsy DeVos thinks the major problem with Title IX is that it is too easy for rapists to be convicted. Are her fears founded? Nationally, the number of assault cases that go unreported hovers around 63 percent. The number of reported cases found either baseless or unsubstantiated is about 2 percent. Moreover, DeVos isn’t rolling back guidelines that unfairly discriminate against the accused — she is removing protections on the rights of survivors to pursue due legal action. The consequences of that action are largely subject to the processes of universities.
Nonetheless, if your child decides to spend his or Saturday nights physically and psychologically traumatizing fellow students, yes — they have forfeited their right to his education. That’s the meaning of the “law and order” Trumpians like DeVos are supposed to love so much — and I don’t know about you, but this ultra-sensitivity toward violent criminals sounds like the stuff of “snowflakes” to me. 
But back to the larger problem: From Nazis to college rapists and climate change deniers, from white supremacist-led terrorism to police brutality, contrary to traditional decency and objective common sense, the new morality of the Trump administration is clear: Let your kids eat ice cream for dinner.
The administration equivocates the 98 percent of scientists who have observed and demonstrated evidence of climate change to the 2 percent who refuse to believe it. It equivocates the desires of neo-Nazis to terrorize with the civil rights of those citizens they seek to exterminate. It equivocates the voluntary danger of the police role with the involuntary danger of constant, life-threatening racial discrimination. You can say and do almost anything: praise Nazi ideas, defend rapists, commit acts of terrorism,  argue against life-saving science, use a police badge as a license to kill, and the president and his cabinet will go out of the way to give you time. There is no larger purpose to the office as Trump sees it; he is not interested in crafting his administration to be a role model for the loftier ideals of American culture and society.
Of course, let me also add that these groups should have, and are entitled to, the full extent of their free speech. But when an administration goes out of its way to give a national platform to white supremacists, it is because that administration does not have the moral or social backbone to tell the crying children of a dying whitelash to put that swastika away and become a productive member of society. When an administration thinks the problem with Title IX is that it’s too hard to get away with rape, it’s because that administration does not have the moral or social backbone to tell these pathetic, entitled predators to assume some personal responsibility to change their behavior. 
The highest office in the land should send a higher message — that is to say, if you felt bad for Brock Turner because his rape of another student destroyed his career of swimming to the end and back the fastest, you are not in line with the values of brotherhood, legalism and honor upon which this country was originally founded.
Be aware of the larger message the Trump administration is sending, and be vigilant that we do not allow it to be internalized into mainstream American society long after Trump is gone: In this country, we do not let anyone do exactly as they please. That is the alt-right’s bastardization of the meaning of American freedom. This administration is weak in myriad ways, but most especially in being a reliable leader in social progress and moral responsibility.

Brian Chin | Daily Trojan
Stanford used to be considered an easy conference game for the Trojans (USC leads the all time series 59-32). But when Jim Harbaugh coached the Cardinal to a jaw-dropping upset over No. 2 USC back in 2007, the matchup shifted into a full-fledged rivalry. Since that fateful afternoon in the Coliseum, Stanford has won seven of its last 10 games against USC, including its current three-game winning streak. 
“They seem to never drop off,” junior linebacker Cam Smith said. “This is my favorite game every year leading up to it … We still have a salty feeling from last year.” 
In order for the Trojans to capture their first win over Stanford since 2014, Smith and the defense will need to be much more effective at containing the run. In last year’s game, Stanford was anchored by a 172-yard rushing performance by Christian McCaffrey en route to a 27-10 victory. This year, there appears to be little drop off in the team’s ground and pound attack despite losing McCaffrey to the NFL – in the Cardinal’s opener, star running back Bryce Love raced for 180 yards. 
After being overshadowed as the backup last season, Love enters this campaign as the feature back who inherits an experienced offensive line. The team also returns Keller Chryst at quarterback, whose efficiency balances out the team’s offensive game plan. 
“Love is a kid with tremendous explosion,” head coach Clay Helton said. “I don’t know his actual time, but he has to be a 4.40 [40-yard dash time] kid. He’s not a 220-pound back, but he runs extremely strong.” 
Slowing down Love and the Cardinal will be a major challenge for the Trojans, as USC’s run defense looked less than promising in week one. Against Western Michigan, USC gave up 263 rushing yards, and the Broncos dominated time of possession by nearly 10 minutes. On the bright side for USC, junior linebacker Cam Smith can play the entire game unlike last week, when he was serving a first half suspension stemming from a targeting penalty in the Rose Bowl.
When Smith entered the game on Saturday, the Trojan front seven came alive and started finding penetration, as all four of the Trojan’s tackles for loss came in the second half, with Smith notching two of them. Perhaps most importantly, the team captain brought leadership to a struggling defensive unit. 
“There’s so much experience that Cam brings to the table,” Helton said. “He’s kind of like [redshirt sophomore quarterback] Sam [Darnold] on the other side of the ball. He’s kind of that quarterback of the defense that gets everybody lined up and makes plays.” 
Like the run defense, the passing attack is another aspect of USC’s game that will need to be improved upon from week one. Junior slot receiver Deontay Burnett hauled in seven catches for 142 yards, continuing where he left off from his remarkable performance in the Rose Bowl. However, outside of Burnett, Darnold’s other targets struggled to get open. Junior Jalen Greene was thrown to multiple times, including on a deep 50-50 ball that got intercepted, but finished with just one catch for 11 yards. Sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe entered the season as one of Darnold’s most trusted pass catchers, but he was limited against the Broncos due to a nagging hip injury. He also caught one pass on the day.
Given that talented sophomore wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. is still about a week away from returning from an ankle injury, USC will look for other fresh faces to emerge at the receiver position. Redshirt freshmen Velus Jones and Tyler Vaughns both caught passes on Saturday but have yet to make an impact, while true freshman Joseph Lewis IV should be in store for more playing time after a solid week of practice. All three could be called upon in big moments against a stellar Cardinal secondary.
“We challenged them today,” Helton said. “This is going to be one of those games, it always is, where you have to make to make the tough catches. They have a very experienced, older [secondary] group that are all juniors and seniors. This is not going to be a game where you’re wide open.” 
Unlike in the passing game, where Darnold’s two-interception performance drew plenty of raised eyebrows throughout the sports world, the Trojans’ running game elicited universal acclaim. Junior Ronald Jones and true freshman Stephen Carr both looked like they were shot out of canons as they combined for 228 yards and five touchdowns. Their cause received another boost on Thursday, as Helton announced that offensive tackle Chuma Edoga should be good to go against Stanford after suffering a knee bruise in last week’s game. 
After Wednesday’s practice, Smith said that he had “something to prove,” against the visiting No. 14 Stanford Cardinal. On Saturday, he and his teammates will get that chance.

After kicking off the season with 27-3 and 24-3 victories over the Labor Day weekend, the second-ranked men’s water polo team is already looking ahead to taking on No. 3 Stanford at home on Friday.
While the weekend games allowed the Trojans’ new freshmen and redshirts to get their first touches during a collegiate game, the team knows that it must be prepared to take on a full-strength Stanford team.
“I think this weekend was kind of a confidence builder,” said sophomore 2-meter Matt Maier, who was named the MPSF Newcomer of the Year in 2016. “It kind of built that we are a good team, so I think that will help us this year and going into the Stanford game.”
The Trojans have won five straight games against the Cardinal, and they have been looking forward to taking on their Pac-12 rivals again. But the team also knows that it must stay within the system that head coach Jovan Vacic has created, which has kept USC a powerhouse program for so many years.
“We always approach it one game at a time,” senior driver Blake Edwards said. “You know, we have a very long winning history and culture at this program, but it all comes down to treating each opponent we have with the same level of respect, studying our opponents and [making sure] that we are well-prepared going into every game.”
After the Trojans’ disappointing finish last season — an overtime loss to Cal in the NCAA Championship — the squad is ready to prove it can take the final step and bring home the program’s 10th national title, which would tie Stanford and UCLA for the second most all-time. 
“We didn’t really lose much from last year,” Maier said. “I think we are a much better team from last year, so I think we will be able to show a lot of people that we are going to be a really good team.”
USC has already kicked off its season, but Stanford’s visit will mark the Trojans’ home opener. Playing at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center means the comfort of a home crowd and pool, and the team is looking forward to playing for fans, friends and family.
“We love playing at home, especially in front of the band and in front of our crowds,” Edwards said, “But Stanford games always bring in really big numbers, so everyone is just really excited for the support.”
Even with the support of a home crowd, the Trojans must be wary of a surging Cardinal team. Stanford is off to a perfect, 4-0 start to the season, and it already boasts three wins over ranked opposition — including a 21-5 drubbing of No. 10 Harvard, a 2016 NCAA semifinalist. In three games against top-25 teams, the Cardinal have outscored their opponents by a combined score of 61-10.
Last weekend may have been a good confidence booster, but the Trojans know that each game presents its own challenges, and they are locked in on being prepared for each one as they come.
“I just think we have to really focus on our systems and play in our style of play,” Edwards said. “I think if we can put that together, then we should get the result we are after. We know if we play our best water polo, no one can stop us this season.”
USC takes on Stanford at 5 p.m. at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.

After a mixed weekend of results for the Women of Troy — with one win and one loss during their Midwest road trip — the No. 12 women’s soccer team will look to come back to Los Angeles ready for their games Friday and Sunday against Santa Clara and Iowa State. 
Santa Clara (2-3-1), which is also returning from a weekend Midwest road trip, already has a wealth of experience playing Pac-12 opposition this season, with games against No.1 UCLA, No. 24 California and unranked Washington State under its belt with the Broncos.  The team’s last game was against Notre Dame and ended in a 4-1 defeat to the Irish, with the Santa Clara defense surrendering 24 shots with 10 on target.  These stats represent good news for the Trojans who achieved 19 and 13 shots respectively this past weekend.
However as advantageous as this might sound, the Trojans and Broncos have history, with Santa Clara beating USC 3-2 in a thrilling overtime game last year.  The Trojans’ backline, led by junior defender Ally Prisock, will have its hands full due to the lack of a single main goalscorer for the Broncos, with three players scoring multiple goals this season.   
Head coach Keidane McAlpine is looking forward to Friday’s game as he sees a solid match-up between the Trojans and Broncos, noting that Santa Clara’s “well-coached” and “great defensive team” will be a test for USC. 
The opponent for Sunday’s game, Iowa State (2-3-1), is a team that, at least on paper, looks like an easier proposition for the Trojans.  The Cyclones will have just concluded a Friday night game at Cal State Fullerton and come to Los Angeles without the experience of playing a single nationally ranked opponent this season.  
The Cyclones are led in scoring by freshman Courtney Powell, who has a conversion rate of one goal every 146 minutes.  The freshman leads the team in shots, shots on goal and goals even though she has only started one game this season.  The Trojans will have to keep an eye on this freshman throughout the game to prevent her from adding to her season’s goal tally.
However, there is good news for Trojan fans as both the Trojans and Cyclones have faced a common opponent this season in Mizzou, with each team experiencing contrasting fortunes.  The Trojans left Missouri with all three points while the Cyclones were on the wrong side of a 2-0 result back in August. 
The Trojans must take advantage of a Cyclones defense that gives up an average of 15.5 shots per game, with a little over five shots testing the goalkeeper.  This task will be left up to the Trojans’ front line, led by redshirt senior Alex Anthony, who has two goals in three games starting the season.
Even with this seemingly good news favoring a Trojan victory, McAlpine is not so confident.  He sees a challenge with the Cyclones’ defense as they are a unit that “defends really well and are really organized.” 
Both games should be good tests for the team as both opponents represent unique challenges.  As long as the Trojans fix what has been lacking in the attacking third of the field, being more clinical and converting more of their shots into goals, victory in both games should be easier to attain. With positive results this weekend, the Trojans should aim to break back into the top 10 in the national rankings.

Daniel Zhu | Daily Trojan
USC’s highly anticipated 2017 football season kicked off in a lackluster way on Saturday, as heavy underdog Western Michigan went blow-for-blow with the Trojans, who were unable to pull away until the fourth quarter. For a top-five team, the mere possibility of losing to a Mid-American Conference team in the opening weekend was disappointing.
This week brings a much greater challenge; the 14th-ranked Stanford Cardinal come to the Coliseum for a rivalry game after pounding Rice 62-7 two weeks ago. Here are the key areas the Trojans will have to improve on to defeat Stanford for the first time since 2014.
Stop The Run
Western Michigan ran for 263 yards on Saturday, on 5.5 yards per attempt. The Trojans were unable to get a push from their defensive line, and the result was consistent openings for Bronco running backs. USC’s lack of physicality was evidenced by the four tackles for loss and one sack during the afternoon match.
The front line wasn’t the only issue. Trojan linebackers and defensive backs missed a lot of tackles in the secondary. USC struggled to track down and wrap up open-field runners.
This type of play will be an issue against a Stanford team that bludgeoned Rice for 287 rushing yards on 8 yards per attempt. The Cardinal have four returning starters along the offensive line, and they looked dominant in Week 1. USC’s run defense must be tougher, not only this week, but also moving forward.
Darnold needs to take the helm
To be clear, Darnold wasn’t bad on Saturday. He was 23-of-33 for 289 yards, ran for a touchdown and converted on six of his eight third down attempts. He made the plays the team needed, and did the best he could behind a slightly spotty pass-blocking offensive line.
However, the type of performance that can down Western Michigan isn’t the same as the one that is necessary to defeat Stanford. Darnold’s two interceptions, while coming on tipped balls, were not placed in the right spot for receivers to make plays. He lacked chemistry with every receiver but junior Deontay Burnett, missing multiple throws downfield on miscommunications, and he didn’t throw a touchdown.
Darnold was far from USC’s biggest problem Saturday. But Stanford’s defense will be much stouter than Western Michigan’s. They won’t let junior Ronald Jones II and freshman Stephen Carr run over, around and through them. The receivers likely won’t gain any more separation. For the Trojans to win, Darnold will need to make plays with his feet and complete tough throws. He needs to prove he is worth the hype.
Cut Down On Mistakes
Issues of discipline plagued the team last season, especially during the 1-3 start, and it was the same story Saturday. 
The Broncos scored touchdowns on a double pass and a kick return, which were key in maintaining an early lead in the second half. Junio linebacker Porter Gustin was inches from intercepting the double pass and taking it to the house, but once quarterback Jon Wassink had the ball in his hands, he had a clear path to the end zone. 
The team committed two turnovers on Darnold’s interceptions, and it would have been three if the Broncos recovered an errant snap. The Trojans were penalized nine times, including four on the offensive line, for a total of 94 yards. The line’s communication struggles were apparent on a third down sack in which the pass rusher reached Darnold untouched. 
Receivers dropped no fewer than four Darnold passes, and sophomore cornerback Jack Jones set the Trojans back when he let his knee touch the ground while receiving a kick. These type of unforced errors will be deadly against an opponent of Stanford’s caliber, and the Trojans will be embarrassed at home if they don’t clean up their act.

OK — let’s try this again.
The Trojans escaped with a season-opening win last week, battling back from behind to beat Western Michigan 49-31, but it was an inauspicious beginning for a team with championship aspirations. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold also got off to a sputtering start after being the preseason Heisman Trophy favorite, throwing two interceptions in a home game for the first time in his career. Surviving the unexpected Bronco stampede actually cost USC two spots in the AP Poll, as Oklahoma, Penn State and Clemson all leapfrogged the Trojans, who now sit at No. 6.
Head coach Clay Helton and his squad brushed off last weekend as a learning experience, but they must get through their growing pains before Saturday night. Conference rival No. 14 Stanford is in town seeking its fourth consecutive win against USC, and the Cardinal don’t fear the Coliseum: They’ve won in four of their last five visits there, and most recently, they hung 41 points on the Trojans in 2015. A repeat of Week 1’s performance would lay waste to all the momentum Helton’s team has generated since last October.
So we’re at a tipping point. It sounds melodramatic to say in Week 2, but it’s true. With no bye week during the regular season and a strong schedule, USC faces a steep climb to the playoff if it comes up short against Stanford. It would likely have to win out — ten consecutive victories — coming off two shaky showings and with back-to-back road trips to Cal and Washington State on the horizon.
Beat the Farm, on the other hand, and all the first-game overreactions go out the window, and business resumes as usual for the Darnold-era Trojans. Based off the current AP rankings, Stanford is the most formidable opponent on USC’s schedule. Once again, it’s early, but a victory this weekend would be a significant boost to the team’s confidence and playoff resume.
But besting the Cardinal has always been a challenge, even during the Trojans’ golden age under former head coach Pete Carroll (this year marks the ten-year anniversary of Stanford’s upset against USC in 2007, when the Cardinal entered the Coliseum as 41-point underdogs). Western Michigan exposed multiple holes in USC’s game last week, including an inconsistent air attack, a still-green offensive line and an unconvincing run defense. Time can sort these issues out, but that’s not a luxury Helton and company currently have. They must put the pieces together on the fly if they are to live up to their lofty expectations.
As Darnold’s introduction proved last fall, the Trojans are capable of adjusting in-season to great effect. And they have the talent to do so again this season — especially on the defensive side of the ball, where they have numerous established impact players: junior linebackers Cam Smith and Porter Gustin, junior cornerback Iman Marshall and junior safety Marvell Tell III, who grabbed the game-clinching pick-six last Saturday.
On the offense, however, question marks abound. The run game looks healthy, as the Trojans look to establish another two-headed rushing monster with junior Ronald Jones II and freshman Stephen Carr. Junior wide receiver Deontay Burnett appears set to continue his breakout 2016 campaign, and despite his relative struggles, we know better than to doubt Darnold. 
But aside from that quartet, no offensive player really appeared a threat during the season opener. Many assumed Darnold’s presence would be more than enough to cope with JuJu Smith-Schuster’s departure to the NFL. One week into the season, it appears they underestimated the star wideout’s impact.
Fortunately, it appears USC may have found a weapon to kick-start their aerial offense. Freshman wide receiver Joseph Lewis IV was Helton’s highest-profile recruit alongside Carr last spring, and there were whispers around practice that he could be ready to take on a bigger role. At six-foot-two, 205 pounds, Lewis offers wingspan that Darnold doesn’t get throwing to the likes of Burnett and redshirt senior receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. Furthermore, sophomore Michael Pittman Jr. is about a week away from returning from an ankle sprain, adding a six-foot-four, 215-pound frame to the mix in the near future. Lewis and Pittman’s presence could bring a sizeable boost the Trojans’ vertical, big-play situations — an explosiveness USC seemed to lack against Western Michigan.
It’s obviously no easy task for a team to maintain a lethal ground game and passing offense alongside an in-sync offensive line and shutdown defense. But the Trojans are also one of the few programs that even have the depth of talent to achieve that kind of well-rounded strength. That’s what made them a popular preseason pick for the national championship. That’s what convinced more than 60,000 fans to flock to the Coliseum in ungodly hot weather last weekend, and that’s what will bring Trojan Nation out in full force this Saturday.
They’re here because they believe USC has championship chops. Let’s see if the Trojans can prove it against the Cardinal.

From Petrarch’s sonnets to Taylor Swift’s heartbroken ballads, there exists a historical tradition of recounting tales of lost love and transforming the art that stems from the relationships into some sort of retribution. That is exactly what Brooklyn-based artist Kate Stone seeks to capture in her month-long installation, The Altar: Good Memories of Bad Love, set to debut at the Museum of Broken Relationships. The interactive project will run from Sept. 9 to Oct. 1 and aims to provide visitors with a place to fondly look back at past relationships and honor the bygone memories they created.
Patrons are invited to box up objects that hold the worst memories of a relationship and then sacrifice them at The Altar. With its assistance in the symbolic act of letting go, The Altar hopes to be a centerpiece in an ongoing journey of an appreciative and mature perspective on what once was.
The project is a sequel to Stone’s illustrated book of short stories, How We End, which was made in collaboration with L.A.-based writer Hannah Schneider. The book traces the romantic past of an unreliable narrator to underscore the volatility of heartbreak and the way we continue to tell stories despite their distance from the truth. The pair began writing the book in an effort to chronicle their relationship struggles while dating in their mid-20s. The installation will include relics featured in the book as well as those contributed by visitors.
“Because of our different backgrounds — mine in photography and Hannah’s in writing — it is really interdisciplinary. It’s photography, it’s fiction, it’s a book, it’s installation, it’s performance,” Stone said. 
Stone also emphasized that the objects on display in the exhibit would be symbolic of life, death and love.
“They include things like flowers, spiders, moldy fruit, fishing lures and moving boxes,” Stone said.
Stone and Schneider added a personal touch to the installation, with phones that visitors will be able to pick up in order to eavesdrop on recorded conversations the two had with their exes about the stories based on them.
In the midst of the Museum of Broken Relationships’ generally heart-wrenching vibe, The Altar provides a therapeutic platform at which to let go of sadness and instead focus on the rebuilding of the self. Moreover, the permeation of Stone’s and Schneider’s personal romantic pitfalls offers visitors shelter from any feelings of consuming loneliness. In contrast with a revenge narrative or a bitter chronicle, the installation serves as a reminder of the universality of heartbreak and the many ways one can infuse tragedy with transcendental meaning.

On Wednesday evening, the Brain & Creativity Institute’s Joyce J. Cammilleri Hall was buzzing with anticipation for the latest Visions & Voices Event, “O Solo Homo.” The event was a celebration of queer performance and headlined by Marga Gomez and Tim Miller. Gomez is a writer, actress, stand-up comedian and recipient of the GLAAD award bestowed by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation;  Miller is a performance artist whose pieces focus on his exploration of his identity as a gay man. 
“[Miller and Gomez] are two of the most accomplished solo performers in the queer performance world,” said David Roman, faculty organizer of the event and a professor of English. “These artists are committed to creating social change and building communities. I wanted to introduce these artists to a new generation at USC who have never seen them before. It is also really important for queer students and their allies to gather and meet early on in the semester and come together as an extended USC community.” 
Miller opened the night with a set that centered around June 26, 2013, the day that the Defense of Marriage Act was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court and Miller was able to get married and receive the same federal benefits that heteroseuxal couples receive. He also recounted a Gay Pride night in Bozeman, Montana, in 1997 where the event was met with violence from anti-gay groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. 
“It was never enough that they tried to ruin our lives, they wanted to hold our hands to the griddle, ruin our love with their views of hate,” Miller said. 
He ended the set on a happier note and circled back to 2013 when after almost two decades, his husband finally received his green card. 
“It felt like taking a breath I had waited my whole life to take,” Miller said. “We were ready to dive into a new world together, hand in hand.”
After Miller’s set, Gomez came to the stage. She discussed her struggles as a Latina actress and the lack of representation of people of color in Hollywood. 
“There were always the same three roles, a maid, a hooker or a midwife,” Gomez said. 
She eventually transitioned into writing and performing her own skits, two of which she performed called “Lovebirds” and “Pound.” 
After both performances, the event concluded with a question and answer session with the audience and Gomez and Miller talked about their upcoming shows. Gomez will be premiering her 12th show in Los Angeles called “Latin Standard.” Her show will discuss her experiences as a Latina performer and the influence her father had on the Latino communities in New York.
“Being a Latino artist and so outside of the mainstream, we have to keep our history alive,” she said. 
Miller will also be starting his own show in 2018 called “Rooted” in New York City. His pieces will focus on the American identity, incorporate some of his reactions to the current U.S. sociopolitical climate and discuss the parallels between the political unrest of today and that of the Civil War.
Both Miller and Gomez reiterated that they hope to continue to create social change and safe, positive spaces for artists in coming generations. 
“I have a commitment to [making] spaces and avenues for younger acts,” Miller said. “My mission is to generate and embolden, to encourage and use my skills to make art and get through the challenges of today.”

Throughout the years, everyone around me seemed to envy the girls who could “fit in with the boys.” In movies and in real life, I heard on multiple occasions, “I don’t know, I just get along with guys better. They’re so much less drama.” A younger me looked at those girls in amazement. I thought they had some special ability that I lacked, and for a good part of middle school and early high school, I idolized those girls. 
This was heightened by my all-girls school environment that treated boys as an ethereal, mysterious object to be attained. When a boy our age would walk onto campus for any reason, the whispers and stares were common. I was asked on a regular basis, “How could you ever go to school with just girls? Isn’t there so much drama?” and it made me question the school I was going to and ask myself whether there was a void in my life because I wasn’t constantly surrounded by boys. My select guy friends were badges of honor. 
When I first came to USC, I found that I had more close male friends than I did female. I was happy that I had been able to make the transition from all-girls to co-ed smoothly, but my overwhelming emotion was confusion as to why I gravitated away from girl friends despite realizing my immense appreciation for them.
I found that the hyper-idealization of girls who were “cool with the guys” and “not like other girls” made me appreciate the women in my life less for a significant part of my adolescence.  I felt that I was missing out on something that wasn’t as necessary as I made it out to be. As I grew older, became a better feminist and read several articles about how media has created a culture that doesn’t recognize strong female friendships, I understood that my insecurity was completely unfounded. I was unbelievably blessed to have grown up in a community that celebrated strong women and focused on building lifelong bonds between girls.
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Representation of healthy, realistic and supportive female friendships in the media has become more common, but is still greatly lacking. Movies being produced today still fail the Bechdel test at alarming levels. Years of friendship will unravel because of a boy in several shows. Women will constantly prioritize relationships over their most supportive friends. Competition between women is far more common than teamwork. I have often been disappointed with how few of the positive aspects of my female friendships are shown in the media. 
What they don’t show are the countless nights my friends and I spent talking about social justice issues and the things in the world that we want to change. The number of times my best friends have pushed me to advocate for myself and reach for the opportunities that seemed too far to even fathom. How my girl friends have spent hours helping me understand some of the things I want from life and the direction I see myself going. How I can constantly tell my friends that they look beautiful — and mean it every single time — but also tell them that their beauty doesn’t define who they are. For every Blair Waldorf and Serena Van Der Woodsen, there are a million Leslie Knope and Ann Perkins. For every petty, toxic female friendship there are a million unconditionally loving, stimulating female friendships. 
Along with celebrating strong female friendships, there has to be a push toward supporting women in general. Internalized misogyny is rampant, and it manifests itself especially viciously in the political and entertainment worlds. While feminism is becoming more mainstream and girls are exposed to it at an early age, attitudes of slut-shaming, double standards and unrealistic expectations detract from the fight for equality. Building and encouraging healthy individual relationships is the best way to grow this network.
In a society that pits women against each other constantly, female friendships need more recognition. I am in no way trying to undermine girl-guy relationships, and as gender becomes more fluid and people begin to feel more comfortable expressing their identity as they choose, social norms for relationships will hopefully change. But until we reach that point, I encourage all adolescent girls, especially those who want to be the “cool girl” like I did, to celebrate your strong female friendships. The intimacy, reliability and reciprocity that I’ve experienced is not something to be underappreciated. 
Toss out the images of catfights, immaturity and competition that are constantly thrown at you. Enjoy each other’s company, understand what motivates each other and be there for each other when you need it. Simple nights of laughter, food and conversations will be the ones that are etched in your memory forever. The friendships that are worth it will last a lifetime and give you more happiness than you could have ever imagined.

It is an example of what horror movies should be: fun, exhilarating, terrifying, humorous. Far too often, horror films nowadays rely on shock value, whether it be through excessive gore or obnoxious jump scares. While It may employ the occasional jump scare, the film instead tends to rely on atmosphere, tension and suspense to keep the audience on edge at all times. Director Andrés Muschietti is a devoted fan of Stephen King’s 1986 horror novel of the same name, and his appreciation for the book shows. In his pitch to direct the movie, he came equipped with drawings and concepts for what his vision of the film was; two years later, Muschietti has directed a compelling film that does justice to the original work. 
It features a talented cast of young actors and actresses, and their performances carry the film. With an R rating, the middle school characters are actually allowed to swear, which adds humor to the film as well as a level of believability. That’s one of the surprising points of this film: It’s hilarious. Comedy is woven throughout the film, and the jokes almost never misfire. The teenage actors give the film heart — an element many modern horror films seem to lack. The characters’ on-screen chemistry is reminiscent of that in The Goonies or Stranger Things (Finn Wolfhard, star of Stranger Things, plays one of the main juvenile characters in the film). Pennywise the clown, played by Bill Skarsgård, is just as terrifying and disturbing as Tim Curry’s original portrayal in the 1990 television miniseries.
Tyler Kowta | Daily Trojan
It is a film about inner struggle; the main villain feeds off of the fear and dread each individual harbors inside. Whether it be an abusive father, a family tragedy or even a simple fear of clowns, It is about conquering and overcoming fear. Pennywise the Clown, or “It,” is the manifestation of each character’s worst fear; It is fear personified. The effects in the film are top of the line, whether it be Pennywise’s makeup, or a disfigured woman in a painting literally crawling off the canvas.
If there is one aspect of the film that was lacking a bit, it was the actual scares. The film is indeed terrifying and disturbing at times, but never truly blood-curdling. The film is dark, but nowhere near as threatening as other contemporary horror films. For every truly scary moment, there was another filled with laughs. At times it felt as if the audience was more afraid than the actual kids in the movie. They displayed an almost irrational bravery, considering what they were going up against. Despite these critiques, the cast delivered a believable and genuine performance.
It is a good horror film; a great one, in fact. But it isn’t just high-quality for a horror movie — it’s an extremely high quality movie in general. From the storytelling and cinematography to the extremely talented cast and special effects team, It doesn’t just deliver horror, but is a masterful piece of cinema.
