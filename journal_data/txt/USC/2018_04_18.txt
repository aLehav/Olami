As the FBI probe into college basketball drags on, we find ourselves victimized by news fatigue. With each passing week, there seems to be another school involved, another coach or agent accused of passing on illicit benefits to players. Eventually, this might become pointless, because the notion that a majority of schools are in violation of NCAA rules is not too far-fetched, and it would be impossible to sanction every single school.
Keep that in mind as you follow the developments of the Todd McNair trial that began on Wednesday. McNair, a former USC running backs coach who became a central figure in the sanctions leveled against the University after the Reggie Bush investigation, is accusing the NCAA of defamation in a lawsuit that was filed back in 2011. 
Here’s the SparkNotes-esque summary: The NCAA claimed McNair was aware that Bush received illegal benefits that resulted in USC vacating its 2004 national championship and Bush forfeiting his Heisman Trophy. It also alleged that McNair provided misleading information about the case, and slapped him with a show-cause penalty, endangering his employment. USC did not renew his contract when it expired, and he has not coached since.
So McNair filed a lawsuit, which has taken seven years to reach trial. Several attempts by the NCAA to have the case thrown out  have been dismissed, and eight separate judges have been assigned to the case. 
In that time, the football program has gone through a rebuild, cycling through two infamous head coaching dismissals and finally settling on Clay Helton, who has restored stability and respectability to the team. Two seasons ago, USC won the Rose Bowl. Last year, it won the Pac-12 title. And it could very well produce the top pick in this year’s NFL Draft in Sam Darnold. The state of the program in 2018 is far from what it was in 2011. 
But still, this last fragment from the sanctions that have become known as college football’s “death penalty” remains, and the ramifications have surely been felt. Aside from the tangible effects — championship and scholarships stripped, a postseason ban, etc. — USC has become much more stringent on athletes who may have committed a violation. Last year, when family friends of former men’s basketball player De’Anthony Melton were alleged to have received benefits through a would-be sports agent, Melton was held out of the entire season, much to the chagrin of his teammates and head coach Andy Enfield, who made repeated comments to the media lamenting Melton’s status.
While O.J. Simpson’s jersey still sits on the Coliseum peristyle, prominently displayed during home games, Bush’s jersey is no more. Bush’s Heisman trophy is gone. His name has been wiped off all records, like he never existed. In press releases and game notes, USC is extremely careful to note wins, stats or records that have been vacated because of the sanctions. A season’s worth of games never happened.
The verdict of McNair’s lawsuit will have no legal bearing on USC. But it will, at the very least, harken back to the dark days when the NCAA poured gasoline all over USC and then lit a match — all because one man received improper gifts.
Which brings us to the present and this FBI probe that seemed so eye-popping upon first glance, but is looking more and more like a waste of time and resources. Bush’s violation is no different from the types of infractions that the FBI is currently looking into. But right now, it has literally tens of programs in its grasp. Will the NCAA issue the death penalty to every single one of these schools?
That’s doubtful. While it is noble of the FBI to help the NCAA enforce its rules, the bureau surely has more important things to do than use wiretaps and undercover officers to determine which athletes had the audacity to seek compensation for their own talents and violate the NCAA’s holy model of “amateurism.” And the NCAA should have known, even a decade ago, that this model is outdated. 
Of course, it doesn’t. That’s why we’re here today. It’s why Bush’s college football career, one of the most illustrious ever, was wiped off the books; why McNair’s coaching career was ruined; why USC is terrified of this all happening again. Think of the money, the time, the resources, the manpower spent over the past seven years just for McNair’s case to begin on Wednesday, just so we can determine what he knew about a teenager accepting gifts.
Forget about amateurism. The silliness of all this — that is the real shame.

The USC Annenberg Institute for Diversity and Empowerment in conjunction with the art collective When Woman Disrupt installed a controversial mural on March 22. 
The sentence “Dismantle Whiteness and Misogyny on this Campus” is painted on the ceiling above it. The word “whiteness” is a poor choice for this mural, and the artwork’s purpose loses its impact because of its sweeping hostility. 
To be clear, I believe dismantling misogyny and racism are in the best interest of the University and society in general. However, by using the word “whiteness” instead of “racism,” “prejudice,” “bigotry,” “intolerance” or countless other options, the mural fails to draw the empathy and attention of the very people it should be targeting. 
IDEA Co-Director Alison Trope reached out to the group When Woman Disrupt to paint and install the mural, and told the Daily Trojan that “whiteness” is being misinterpreted to mean “white people,” when in fact it is being used to connote broader systems, not individual people. 
And yet, by dictionary definition, “whiteness” means exactly what the mural’s critics believe it does: the quality or state of being white. 
The notion that “whiteness” refers to a broader and more complex idea is not recognized by most. That does not necessarily mean the mural’s artists did not have positive intentions, or weren’t referring to “whiteness” as an overarching system of oppression. But if that is the case, then there is a fundamental problem with this ideology: Why try to inspire change with implications and connotations rather than with a direct and straightforward message? 
It would make much more sense not to allude to or connote this more complex “system,”  “culture” or “climate” that Trope mentioned in her interview with the Daily Trojan, but rather, to be forthright and say this directly in the message. 
It’s hard to argue pale skin is what causes superiority and inferiority in American society. Though the mural nor Trope ever contend that all white people are racist, by the mural explicitly calling for the dismantling of “whiteness,” it comes off as attacking white skin color. 
And despite the mural and its label not intending to attack white people for the color of their skin, the word “whiteness” repels certain white students from taking its message of tolerance to heart. Few disagree with the belief that misogyny and racism are aspects of our culture that should be eliminated. This message is not meant to divide the University, but seemingly — because of its choice of a single word — it has.
The faculty response to the outcry and criticism from conservative media outlets has been the continuous assertion that the artwork is meant to spark conversation. But according to Annenberg Media, a poster put up next to the mural that read, “White Male Privilege is a Myth” was taken down. It is unclear who took down this poster, though the faculty denies that it was them. If the true intention is to initiate conversation, then this poster should have stayed up alongside the mural regardless of whether or not the students or faculty agree with the counter-poster’s message.
Di Wu | Daily Trojan
That said, it is futile to make personal attacks on the students or faculty members who chose the word “whiteness” for the mural’s label. I don’t believe they had bad intentions or are out to get white students at USC. After all, the mural’s intention is to initiate conversation and get students to begin thinking about issues such as racism, and this is exactly what is happening, as demonstrated with this week’s “Point/Counterpoint” topic.
I hope those who selected the word “whiteness” understand how their mural could be interpreted to mean something negative and unintended, and subsequently join the conversation and debate around the mural.
“We understand that there may be those who disagree with the statement offered by the artists,” the Office of the Dean said in a statement to Fox News. “However, we firmly believe that civil discourse and the free exchange of ideas around sensitive topics are critical to the resolution of differences and to addressing issues facing our community and society as a whole.”
While the University senior administration should not force IDEA to remove or alter the word “whiteness,” it would benefit both sides of the controversy if the mural’s installers made an effort to change the word to something more direct and consistent with the message they intend to spread.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that a poster hung by the mural that said “White Male Privilege is a Myth” was removed by faculty. The poster was removed, but not by faculty.  The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

People have a real problem with whiteness — and with the term “whiteness.”
Since the art collective When Women Disrupt placed a mural asking passersby to “Dismantle Whiteness and Misogyny on this Campus” near the Annenberg School for Journalism and Communication, the mural has caught the attention of local news and conservative media outlets. Most of the controversy revolves around that w-word: “whiteness,” what it means and whether it’s an appropriate or accurate word to use on a public art project.
Like many English words, “whiteness” has multiple definitions. While several dictionaries define “whiteness” as having some relationship to “white” as a racial identifier, it’s also quite clear that a sign at an elite research university might refer to the academic definition of “whiteness,” often explored in critical whiteness studies. In a piece called “Dismantling Whiteness in Academe” for Inside Higher Ed, Salvador Vidal-Ortiz clarifies several times that the discussion of whiteness as a structure is inherently different from whiteness as a race.
“Here, I talk about whiteness as a discourse that enables a set of practices, which activates, with its own set of codes, certain responses and actions,” Vidal-Ortiz wrote. “But I am not speaking of white people — whether administrators, colleagues, students — or even whiteness as a race.”
“Whiteness” does not imply white people; it refers to socially constructed systems of power and privilege. And Alison Trope, faculty co-director for the Annenberg Institute for Diversity and Empowerment, has made that clear.
“We’re talking about different lenses or frames we see the world through, when they say [whiteness], that is not directed at individual white people or individual males, it’s about a system, it’s about a culture, it’s about a climate,” Trope told the Daily Trojan.
The creators of this public art project did not imply harm toward white people when they wrote to “dismantle whiteness,” but they did imply that we live in a structural system of whiteness that confers social, cultural and political advantages to white people — to the detriment of people of color. That is the stronger, more salient point, and one which critics fail to see.
Scholarship supporting this reality is vast. A 2015 study from data scientist David Mosenkis found regardless of income level, majority-white schools consistently received more funding than schools with more students of color. John Schmitt, co-author of a 2014 study from the Center for Economic and Policy Research, found the evidence of racial discrimination in the labor market “overwhelming,” pointing to studies that sent identical resumes to companies with white and black names, and found that white Americans were hired twice as often as black Americans.
Di Wu | Daily Trojan
Additionally, in interviews, white Americans with criminal histories were more likely to be hired than black Americans without criminal histories. In 2017, a ProPublica investigation found car insurance companies charged customers in white neighborhoods lower rates than those in black neighborhoods, even though the neighborhoods were comparable in risk. The empirical evidence goes on and on: Compared to black Americans, in many situations, white Americans receive a better education, are hired more, paid more, pay less and are killed less by the hands of law enforcement — simply on the basis of race. Hence, “whiteness.”
But why use “whiteness” at all, if it incites so much controversy? In his counterpart to this column, my peer Shauli Bar-On suggests “racism,” or “bigotry,” or “intolerance.” But until we recognize the issue of advantages conferred to white people — yes, on the basis of their race — is systemic, that it is entrenched in our nation’s history and that it has inherently created racialized experiences for everyone, we can’t really begin to dismantle these power structures. It’s not just bigotry or prejudice or intolerance or racism — what we refer to here is this system of “whiteness,” and it is important to call it by its name.
Criticizing conversations about racism by challenging the appropriateness of its tone or the diction is a worn leaf out of a conservative playbook. It’s obvious that “dismantle whiteness” did not refer to actual white people. Rather, “whiteness” incites discomfort because a system that continues to benefit white people at the expense of others is uncomfortable. Racism is uncomfortable. We shouldn’t coddle those who are white by sanitizing or downplaying the forces that we face. Rather, we should challenge them to meet us where we are, so that we can collectively understand each other.
Perhaps replacing “whiteness” with “bigotry” would have resulted in a statement that felt more comfortable for passersby. But public art isn’t supposed to state the obvious — it’s supposed to provoke and stimulate thoughtful dialogue and vigorous debate.
Looks like it’s done its job, then.

As the spring semester draws to a close, it’s as good a time as any to look back on the new music 2018 has already produced. After a somewhat slow start to the year, the release calendar has recently picked up in sweeping fashion, with three of the top five albums on this list having dropped in the month of April alone. Here is a list of 2018’s top hip-hop and R&B albums thus far. 
10. Chris Dave and the Drumhedz by Chris Dave and the Drumhedz
Chris Dave makes a formidable entrance into the spotlight on his debut album, weaving between fast-paced funk and slow, soulful R&B with ease. The talented drummer has more than proved his abilities on collaborations with high-profile artists during his long, decorated career, and on songs like “Spread Her Wings” and “Dat Feelin’,” he shows that he’s just as capable when it’s his name on the cover. The Anderson .Paak-assisted “Black Hole” is a tremendous starting point if you’re looking to introduce yourself to his music, but the entire album makes for an engaging listen-through as well.
Sango has made a name for himself as a one-of-a-kind producer, and his new album In the Comfort Of sees him further developing his sound on his most fully formed project to date. Photo courtesy of Last Gang Records.
9. Sango – In the Comfort Of
Sango’s latest album In the Comfort Of is his most complete project to date, themed around the process of finding overcoming times of turmoil and finding one’s comfort. A laundry list of features find themselves at home above Sango’s intricate production; Smino’s brilliant wordplay on “Khlorine” deserves special commendation, while Dave B, Jean Deaux and JMSN shine elsewhere when called upon. A refreshing journey through exciting, energetic highs and introspective, heartfelt lows, the project further establishes Sango as a top-of-the-line producer, who shines alongside vocalists as well as on his own instrumentals.
8. Trouble – Edgewood
Edgewood is further evidence of the possible benefits of working exclusively with a single producer for an entire project, and there are few producers who are more qualified for that distinction than Mike-WiLL Made-It. He and Trouble together form a menacing combination comparable to the magic made by 21 Savage and Metro Boomin on Savage Mode, although Edgewood invites many more signature sounds to the table in the form of names like Drake, Quavo and The Weeknd. While each of those collaborations more than holds their weight, the unassisted “Knock It Down” is the true standout of the project, as Trouble settles into an effortless, rhythmic flow over Mike-WiLL’s booming production.
7. Phonte – No News is Good News
A soulful blend of earthy, thoughtful bars and a melodic soundscape, Phonte’s latest album No News is Good News is 33 minutes of wisdom from a veteran in the game, touching on themes of love and aging. Phonte speaks on health-related worries that have taken a toll on his mind, withholding nothing from his audience to allow them to glean as much as possible from the performance. An album to be studied rather than glossed over, there’s likely at least one message on No News is Good News that you need to hear.
6. SiR – November
In 11 songs, SiR makes his official TDE introduction, and finds few missteps in the process. The smooth sounds of “Something Foreign” and “D’Evils” are perfect for a sunny Saturday afternoon, while harder-hitting percussion on cuts such as “I Know” create impressive variety on the project. SiR’s vocals shine throughout November, showcasing him as an excellent crooner with a promising career ahead of him. 
At long last, Cardi B’s debut album has arrived, and on it, she proves why she’s been the hottest name in hip-hop for much of the past year. Cardi B is humorous, genuine and versatile on Invasion of Privacy, while keeping the confident, authoritative essence that has endeared her to fans. Each of the impressive features such as Chance the Rapper, SZA and Kehlani deliver as well, while Cardi B stays in the spotlight throughout by making the most of every verse.
4. They Might Have Even Loved Me by NoMBe
NoMBe’s addition to this list is questionable since he released over half the songs on the tracklist as a single in 2017, but the project’s cohesiveness despite it’s disjointed release certainly deserves praise. They Might Have Even Loved Me is an ambitious ode to the women in NoMBe’s life, right from the very first song “Man Up:” “This world was never meant for us/It’s for the girls and children first, and then men.” A wild, adventurous spirit permeates the album with an infectious energy on songs like “Signs” and “Freak Like Me,” while slower cuts such as the acoustic “Rocky Horror” embody a night around the campfire after the day’s excursions have turned to memories.
3. CARE FOR ME by Saba
Saba’s always been an introspective rapper, but CARE FOR ME is more than that, as Saba slows the tempo and dampens the mood for pensive bars that leave you thinking long after the moment has passed. Look to the seven-minute-plus “PROM/KING” to find the pulse of the album neatly wrapped into one song, as Saba narrates the story of John Walt, close friend and fellow labelmate who was stabbed to death in Chicago. 
2. Isolation by Kali Uchis
“Ridin Round” first highlighted Kali Uchis as a burgeoning star in 2015, and three years later, Isolation is proof that her star is now fully formed. Delicate and soothing while still retaining a constant, irresistible groove, songs such as “Just a Stranger” and “Tyrant” are just as infectious even on repeated listen, while “Tomorrow,” produced by Kevin Parker of Tame Impala, creates a psychedelic soundscape that shifts the direction of the album gracefully.
1. Black Panther The Album Music From and Inspired By by Various Artists
The best movie of the year is also the best album of the year thus far, with a sprawling sound that matches the massive scale of Wakanda itself. Kendrick Lamar excels in his first attempt in the role of executive producer, curating a magnificent body of music that finds cohesion in its diversity. With few sonic threads to link the album together, the dominant theme throughout is that of pride; manifesting itself in the commanding lyrics, passionate singing and fierce production. Hollywood needs to pay attention to what Black Panther was able to accomplish: It’s one thing to craft a fantastic movie, but crossing media to create an equally heralded accompaniment is not only possible, but also encouraged in 2018.

Kitty Guo | Daily Trojan
There are very few things in this world that I hold sacred. They include: my cat Neptune, who was a spritely newborn when I adopted him in the second grade and is now an elderly retiree; the El Dorado Nature Center, where my parents took me on nature walks before I could walk; and the books I loved growing up. 
The common thread here seems to be childhood, which is, in and of itself, sacred; I will defend to the death everyone’s right to a joyous, carefree childhood. I was lucky enough to have the most blissful, loving one possible (shoutout to you, Mom and Dad). 
But the older I get, the more sentimental I get about my elementary school days, and the rosier my glasses are when I look back on those years. And for God’s sake, I’m only 19. By the time I’m middle-aged my memories will all be saturated with a fuchsia hue. 
Yes, I know, I already wrote about a children’s book for my last column. But that was just one of many that I love. Plus, children’s books have broad appeal, enjoyed by young and old alike. I mean, is anyone actually interested in witnessing my attempts to make sense of the absurdity that is Trout Fishing in America/The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster/In Watermelon Sugar? Yeah, didn’t think so. 
So, without further ado, here were (and are) some of my favorite books growing up:
Happy Birthday to You! by Dr. Seuss 
Sure, Green Eggs and Ham is great, but of Dr. Seuss’ extensive oeuvre, Happy Birthday to You! takes the cake. If you weren’t delivered massive bouquets by 50 Hippo-Heimers, pulled through the air by Funicular Goats and serenaded by Dr. Derring’s Singing Herrings, was it even your birthday?
Stella & Sam series by Marie-Louise Gay
Stella is Star, Queen, Fairy and Princess of, respectively, the sea, the snow, the forest and the sky. Such a slew of roles and responsibilities may seem daunting to anyone else, but Stella and her little brother Sam take their duties in stride, and waste no time exploring every inch of their kingdom. 
Too Many Pumpkins!  by Linda White 
I love pumpkin: as a pie, a decorative gourd and a spiced latte, and I firmly believe my affinity stems from reading this book. Rebecca Estelle lives a quiet life with her calico cat Esmeralda in a little cottage, until some pesky pumpkins invade her neat and tidy garden. But these unwelcome intruders may just turn out to be a blessing in disguise…
Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson 
The world is divided into two types of people: those who read Calvin and Hobbes as a kid and those who didn’t.
Winnie the Pooh by A.A. Milne
Pooh and his friends like to play a game called Poohsticks. The rules are: Everyone picks up a small twig or leaf, stands atop a bridge and simultaneously drops it into the stream below. Then they rush to the other side and see whose will emerge first. This is a game I play with my parents at the Nature Center to this day. 
Moomins by Tove and Lars Jansson 
I thought I was the only one who followed the wonderfully whimsical, hippopotamus-shaped creatures in this Finnish comic strip — until eighth grade, when I wrote an article for the lifestyle section about them for my school newspaper and the librarian sent me a lovely note expressing his own enthusiasm for the Moominworld and encouraging me to stop by. I hovered outside the library doors for a solid 10 minutes, but was too painfully shy to go in. Mr. Kovac, if the offer is still on the table, I’d love to take you up on it!
Joscelyn Stocks | Daily Trojan
As this is my last column of the semester, I didn’t want to nominate yet another pretentious venture undertaken by some White Male Intellectual. It would be easy to retreat behind postmodernist blasé, impersonal and impenetrable in its lofty abstruseness. Writing about something sacred to me is harder, because I can’t quite put my finger on where poignant ends and saccharine begins. I strive desperately for the former; I am deathly afraid of the latter. It is a line I have not yet learned to walk.
It’s not enough to say that these books hold a special place in my heart. They are the tangible embodiment of an ephemeral time, the happiest time of my life, that exists only in the memory of a select few. When my cat finally kicks the bucket, and eventually my parents too, there will be no one left to remember me at 5 years old, lying on my stomach perilously close to the bridge’s edge, straining to catch a glimpse; at 7, flipping back and forth between designs trying to decide which one to carve into my Jack-O-Lantern; at 9, hauling my entire Calvin and Hobbes collection aboard the airplane to keep me occupied during a 13-hour flight to China. No one except me — and my books.

Over 150 students, faculty members and custodial staff gathered at Tommy Trojan on Tuesday to advocate for USC custodians to receive higher wages and affordable health care from the University’s subcontractor Aramark.
Colored signs that said “Custodians deserve more than minimum wage,” “Aramark treat custodians as Trojan family” and “Trojan family ready 2 strike” were passed out around Hahn Plaza. Participants wore lanyards attached to badges that read “2018 Todo o nada ¡Ya Basta! #faircontractnow” on one side, and “Trojan family ready 2 strike 4 fair contract #custodiansaretrojans2” on the other. 
“[Custodians] are people, they are raising families, they have children, many of them have lived in Los Angeles for generations, and so they deserve fair pay and health care because that’s what everybody deserves,” said Stephen Boardman, the communications coordinator for the west coast branch of Service Employees International Union. “Minimum wage is never sufficient; just think about living on minimum wage in Los Angeles. You’re talking about living on less than $14 [per] hour. It’s not something that allows you to actually live and care for a family.”
Led by a small group of workers playing snare drums, participants marched down Trousdale Parkway to USC Village and ended their march at the intersection of 32nd and Hoover Street. 
“Some of the custodians are unsatisfied and do have trouble on paying for certain things,” said Veronica Perez, a custodian who said she has worked for Aramark for the past 10 years. “From my personal experience, it is troubling because the rent in Los Angeles is high at the moment, we all have different bills and other necessities that we have to pay for. With our current wages, it is something that we have trouble with on a daily basis.” 
At the end of the rally, the intersection was blocked off by police. Participants sat on the ground in a huge circle as the custodians sang in Spanish. Different chants such as “Estamos en la lucha,” which translates to “We are in the fight,” and “What do we want? A contract! When do we want it? Now!” were called out to capture the attention of passersby. 
When the marchers headed back to USC Village, Stephanie Solis, a freshman majoring in sociology and a student organizer of the rally, gave a speech. She emphasized the importance of supporting all members of the USC community.
“Our fight doesn’t stop here,” Solis said. “USC has boasted about being a Trojan family, but I don’t see that Trojan Family happening here. We are neglecting this part of the community, and both students and administration need to unify together to demonstrate that we are supporting this part of our family.” 
Tuesday’s march  was the follow-up to a rally on March 26, as well as a resolution proposed by the Undergraduate Student Government Senate on April 10 to improve the conditions of the USC custodians. 
The resolution was unanimously approved by the senate at its meeting Tuesday, where some custodians were in attendance.
USG senators proposed reducing the out-of-pocket costs that custodians had to pay monthly for health care. They also proposed increased wages.
Some workers said they would have gone on strike had the resolution not passed.
“We have seen a strong response from students and faculty members,” said Cesar Quiles-Borrero, the lead organizer for SEIU United Service Workers West. “We encourage them to be a part of the struggle because at the end of the day, the campus should be a place for everyone to feel at home. It’s amazing to see the students getting involved and we are really thankful for their efforts.”
Boardman said SEIU has been working on negotiations with Aramark to settle a fair contract between the company and its USC workers to be finalized and signed on April 20.

Some Undergraduate Student Government officials proposed a resolution calling for the creation of a permanent center for undocumented students at the Senate meeting Tuesday.

The resolution was presented by Mai Mizuno, the outgoing USG director of external affairs, and asks for a new space on campus dedicated to a dreamer center that would feature at least one full-time coordinator to work with undocumented students. 
The resolution also proposes that USG and Graduate Student Government create an official resources page for undocumented students to access on the University’s Student Affairs website.
“The investment will be aimed at ensuring that the undocumented or at-risk student population is provided any and all information needed regarding proper legal assistance or guidance concerning their immigration status or their family’s immigration status,” the resolution states.
The resolution also detailed what the role of this center’s coordinator would be if this resolution is passed, stating that the person to take on the role will be “directly involved in the continuing efforts of USG, [GSG], the administration and other organizations on campus to provide the proper support and assistance to undocumented and at-risk students.”
GSG passed a nearly identical variant of this resolution last month and coordinated closely with USG in writing USG’s resolution. The resolution acknowledges the efforts made to address the needs of undocumented students thus far, including the creation of a pop-up center by the American Studies and Ethnicity department.
“The pop-up dreamer center has been created by faculty and students to provide a safe space and resources to undocumented undergraduate and graduate students,” the resolution states. “But this center has not been given full-time recognition by the administration nor a dedicated staff member to facilitate its activities.”
This pop-up dreamer center was created during Fall 2017 and has a part-time staffer who began holding office hours last week. However, advocates for the new center believe that the current center is too small and understaffed.
“Right now, the space is smaller than the USG supply closet,” Mizuno said. “It really only fits a sofa and a desk. That is obviously not enough if you look at the other resource centers on this campus.”
The senate also voted 10-1 to approve the USG budget for the 2018-19 academic year. The budget was amended to strike a proposed partnership with The New York Times that would cost $8,000 to provide physical copies of the newspaper on campus. The $8,000 were instead allocated to staff salaries of USG organizations and the philanthropy fund.
The Senate also unanimously approved the resolution proposed last week to enhance wages and compensation for the custodial staff at USC. Several custodians attended the meeting to watch the resolution pass. 
The Senate will vote on the undocumented student center resolution in next week’s Senate meeting, which will be the final meeting of the 2017-18 academic year.

Students met at Tommy’s Place on Tuesday to hear Democratic strategist Donna Brazile talk about past elections with USC Unruh Institute of Politics director Bob Shrum in the Institute’s final installment of its semester-long Political Conversation series.

The series has hosted a diverse group of guest speakers this semester, including well-known Republican pollster Frank Lutz and former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci. 
Brazile, now an adjunct professor in the women and gender studies department at Georgetown University, has led a well-rounded political career. She is the first black woman to manage a presidential campaign, acting as the campaign manager to former Vice President Al Gore’s 2000 campaign.
Brazile and Shrum discussed the 2000 presidential election, which is  remembered largely for leading to a recount of votes that resulted in George W. Bush winning the presidency. Brazile believed Gore won the election but there were mal-voting processes in Florida where the votes were contested.
“I’ve worked very hard over the last 18 years to improve access to the ballot box,” Brazile said at the event.
Additionally, Brazile is the only person to serve as the Chair of the Democratic National Committee twice. Her first time was during the 2012 election and her second time came in the 2016 election after Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned from the position following a leak of emails from the DNC that indicated a bias toward former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. 
After serving for a second term, Brazile said she conducted an investigation and found that the Clinton campaign had already assumed control of three DNC departments before securing the Democratic nomination. 
At the event, Brazile discussed her new book, Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House, and the backlash she received from President Donald Trump supporters, Senator Bernie Sanders and Clinton. Brazile said she believes multiple factors lead to Clinton’s defeat.
“I think it was the absence of a strong message [and] the failure to engage voters — especially young voters,” Brazile said. “I do believe that the Russian interference in our election had a huge impact in the closing days of the campaign.”
Brazile said Congress needs to take more aggressive steps to “protect the vote” and discourage Russian interference in future elections. Cybersecurity is the nation’s greatest security threat from countries that are attempting to destabilize Western democracies, Brazile said.
Shrum posed the question of whether Trump has changed the nature of American presidencies moving forward, saying that former presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan were able to appeal to the majority of Americans while “lifting them up.” But Brazile says Trump’s behavior runs contrary to this ideal, which will have a lasting impact.
“This is a president who is often unhinged when it comes to promoting himself but almost at the expense of our own democracy,” Brazile said. “He never talks about preserving and standing up for our democracy, he only talks about himself.” 
Brazile said the Democratic Party needs “new blood” and a positive message that will appeal to voters in the 2018 midterm elections and the 2020 presidential election. 
“We have a wealth of activism going on right now within the Democratic party,” Brazile said. “It’s not coming from the Democratic party; it’s coming from grassroots Democrats all across this country fueled by a lot of young people who are willing to put their names on the ballot.”

USC faced Long Beach State and Grand Canyon in a double-header on Tuesday,  winning each matchup 3-2.

Before they took on 6th-ranked Long Beach State at Merle Norman Stadium, the team celebrated Jenna Belton and Jo Kremer’s Senior Day. Playing extensively at the fifth court for the past few years, Kremer and Belton’s contributions were crucial to USC’s national championship runs.
“Jo and Jenna carried us to three national championships,”  head coach Anna Collier said. “They were our rock, and every time we won a big major event, they won. It’s really sad to see them go. They were really the foundation of what we had for the last four years.”
The matches opened up with Belton and freshman Maja Kaiser taking on Long Beach State’s Zoi Konstantopoulou and Nicci Reinking on the fourth court.
Konstantopoulou and Reinking went up early over Belton and Kaiser, going up by as much as 7-16 before taking the first set 11-21. Konstantopoulou and Reinking would go on a 13-7 run the rest of the way to earn Long Beach State’s first point of the evening.
Looking to tie the dual, USC turned to graduate transfer Alexandra Poletto and freshman Haley Hallgren, who took on Hannah Matt and Marisa Ramsey. In the first set, Poletto’s height proved to be a difference maker as she blocked many of Matt and Ramsey’s efforts to score and led to a 21-16 win in the opener.
In the second set, Poletto and Hallgren had the game on the brink with a 20-19 lead before Matt and Ramsey went on a 3-0 run to steal the set. In the decisive third set, Matt and Ramsey came out aggressively, taking a 7-10 lead. However, after a timeout, Poletto and Hallgren would go on an 8-3 run of their own to take the point.
Looking to bounce back from a 1-3 record in last weekend Pac-12 North Invitational, sophomores Joy Dennis and Cammie Dorn battling Megan Kruidof and Rachel Nieto were locked in early on and kept the match tight at 13-15 as a timeout was called. 
After the break, Dennis and Dorn were shutout, dropping the set 13-21. The two then went on to lose the second set 8-21, and Long Beach State claimed their second point.
On the third court, USC’s pair of junior Terese Cannon and freshman Sammy Slater took an early lead over Kristyna Adamcikova and Hailey Harward in the 1st set. They then crushed the Long Beach State duo winning the set 21-9. The second set was more competitive, but Adamcikova and Harward were unable to solve Cannon and Slater’s defense, losing 21-15 and tying the dual for USC.
Despite powerful shots from freshman Tina Graudina and junior Abril Bustamante on the first Court, Long Beach State’s Nele Barber and Sasha Karelov responded well on the first court, leading up to a 17-17 tie late in the first set. Eventually Graudina and Bustamante’s onslaught proved too much too handle as a few costly errors from Karelov and Barber gave USC the first set 21-18. 
It was the same story in set two, as Karelov and Barber were unable to match Graudina and Bustamante’s power and the match ended in a win for the Trojans. 
After the 3-2 win against Long Beach State, USC took on No. 16 Grand Canyon.
Poletto and Hallgren played Grand Canyon’s Jessica Clark and Jamie Walsh. The match started unevenly for USC’s fifth pair, falling behind early 2-8 and eventually losing in the first set. Despite responding well in the second set, Clark’s and Walsh’s crafty shots would prove to be too much too handle and USC conceded the second set 20-22, giving Grand Canyon the first points of the dual.
On court four, Belton and Kaiser looked to bring USC back against Katie Pyles and Madi Relaz. Kaiser and Belton went up 13-8 early in the first set and never looked back. In the second set, Belton and Kaiser fought back from a deficit to take an 18-15 lead, and Kaiser would score the next 4 points to tie up the dual for USC.
On the first and second court, Graudina and Bustamante, and Cannon and Slater both took care of business as usual to seal the win for USC. With the dual already decided, Grand Canyon’s Natalie Honzovicova and Katie Sarber defeated the struggling Dennis and Dorn 21-17, 21-16.
Along with the matches’ importance for the standings, the two wins were also crucial for the Trojans’ mindset moving forward.
“These were must-wins for us,” Belton said. “Today was big because both matches that we won were huge team wins. Different people won at different spots and that’s what it’s about at the end of the day.”
The Women of Troy will have about a week and half to prepare for the Pac-12 Tournament beginning next Thursday at Stanford.

In the days leading up to the 2018 NFL Draft, running back Ronald Jones II and linebacker Uchenna Nwosu joined the ranks of the greatest names in Trojan athletics on the USC All-American Walk. 
Running back Ronald Jones II and outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu became the newest additions to the Walk. Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
The All-American Walk is reserved for a special group of USC football players — a collection of 168 athletes who earned All-American distinctions while playing in the cardinal and gold. Last year’s All-American class included cornerback Adoree’ Jackson, right tackle Zach Banner and left tackle Chad Wheeler.
Nwosu was an aggressive standout for the Trojans’ smothering defense throughout the 2017 season, earning himself the team’s co-MVP award and a slot on the All-Pac-12 first team by the end of his senior year. As a captain, he served as one of the primary leaders for the defense alongside junior linebacker Cameron Smith.
He finished his final season as a Trojan with 75 tackles, including 11.5 tackles for loss and 9.5 sacks. Along with his ability to pursue running backs and quarterbacks along the line of scrimmage and in the backfield, Nwosu excelled throughout the season in his ability to anticipate passes. He finished with a team-high of 13 deflections, the most tallied by a single USC athlete since linebacker Chris Claiborne in 1998.
While Nwosu provided a spark on defense, Jones served as the motor of the offense all season. As a junior, Jones dazzled opposing teams with his speed and ability to tip-toe sidelines. But after packing on 15 pounds of muscle in the offseason, Jones — who was nicknamed the “Texas Tesla” — introduced a new aspect to his game. The extra muscle allowed him to pummel his way through defensive lines, grinding consistently for extra yards after contact that made the difference between first downs and turnovers.
At the end of his senior season, Jones led the Trojan offense with 1,550 yards and 19 touchdowns. With a grand total of 3,619 yards over his years in a Trojan uniform, he finished No. 5 overall on the program’s career rushing list. Jones’ performance earned him a spot alongside Nwosu on the All-Pac-12 first team. He also finished with finalist distinctions for the Earl Campbell Tyler Rose Award, which recognizes the nation’s top offensive players, and the Doak Walker Award, which recognizes the best running backs in Division I football.
The pair’s latest distinction was announced by the USC Athletics department on Monday, when the program posted a picture of two newly minted plaques emblazoned with a portrait of each athlete alongside their names, positions and hometown. With the NFL Combine and their pro days behind them, Nwosu and Jones now await the commencement of the NFL Draft, which will begin on April 26.

Last Tuesday, Andre Ingram played in his first-ever NBA game after spending 10 years in the G-League. 
The 32-year-old “rookie” forward didn’t waste his opportunity debuting for the Los Angeles Lakers. He dazzled the Staples Center crowd, scoring 19 points on a hot 4/5 3-point shooting. 
Ingram went undrafted out of American University in 2007 and has spent the last decade toiling to make his NBA dreams a reality. In order to supplement a roughly $25,000/year G-League salary, Ingram took on a side job tutoring kids in math. 
On Tuesday, his years of hard work finally paid off, with Lakers head coach Luke Walton presenting Ingram with a game ball. Lakers legend (and Oscar winner) Kobe Bryant even toyed with the idea of making a movie about his life. 
“Dude, (the story is) ridiculous. Like, are you kidding me?” Bryant told USA Today. “I mean to have the courage and resolve to stick with that dream, and to now get your shot and to come through in that way? I mean, that’s impressive, man.”
Ingram’s debut represented one of the best feel-good moments of the 2018 NBA season. It also illustrated what the NBA’s developmental league players are capable of. 
In addition to Ingram, another un-drafted G-League player has made waves in recent weeks. Golden State Warriors guard Quinn Cook stepped up to replace an injured Stephen Curry in March and has performed up to the lofty task. 
Over the final 20 games of the regular season, Cook averaged 13.8 points and four assists per game, eventually earning a two-year contract to stay with the team. Cook is now playing significant minutes in the NBA Playoffs, the same season he received first-team All-G League honors. 
Ingram and Cook have proven that G-League players can make an impact on the highest stage. Now, it’s time for more to get a shot in the NBA. Instead of functioning as a distant, alternative league for basketball’s journeymen, the league should operate more as a feeder for big-league teams, similarly to baseball’s minor league system. 
Two-way contracts are a huge step toward this reality. Introduced last season, two-way deals allow NBA teams to sign two extra players (roster sizes increased from 15 to 17), who can play in both the G-League and the NBA — the latter for a maximum of 45 days. Before signing his new NBA-exclusive contract, Cook played on one of these contracts, which allowed him to move back and forth between Golden State and their G-League affiliate, the Santa Cruz Warriors. 
The two-way deal has been successful at creating more ties between NBA teams and their G-League counterparts, allowing for closer development of raw prospects, like Cook.
They also give undrafted players incentive to choose the G-League over more lucrative leagues overseas. Players can earn up to $300,000 a year on two-way deals. 
Still, the G-League has a lot of work to do. Two-way deals have their limitations — they allow players little freedom of movement during seasons, and the 45-day cap on time spent in the NBA is far too low in giving prospects a taste of the big leagues. 
But it continues to make strides in the right direction. The D-League’s rebranding as the G-League in 2017, under a new long-term partnership with Gatorade, was a wise marketing decision for an organization with little existing brand value. It’s already paid dividends, with the league announcing on Tuesday a 35 percent salary increase for players.
Personally, I’d like to see the G-League compete with NCAA programs for high-profile recruits on a more frequent basis. Pay-for-play scandals dominated headlines for most of the 2017-18 college hoops season, slowly breaking down the facade of amateurism in collegiate sports. 
By playing in the G-League, prospects can develop their skills against decent competition and get paid for it, without having to go under the table. The G-League may not compare to playing for college basketball heavyweights like Duke or Kentucky in terms of competition, but for athletes who would rather jump straight to the pros, the G-League allows them to do so without going overseas. 
One high-profile prospect has already made this decision, potentially creating a blueprint for many to come. A few weeks ago, five-star recruit Darius Bazley decided to join the G-League instead of Syracuse, where he originally committed. He’s not the first to choose the G-League over college, but he might be the most high-profile recruit to do so thus far. 
“In the G-League, which I’m about to go into, you’re preparing for the NBA,” Bazley told the Cincinnati Enquirer. “When you’re in college, they prepare you a little bit, but for the most part, you’re preparing for your opponent, preparing for that game.”
This season, Ingram and Cook have proven G-League players can shine when given the chance to play on NBA rosters. They may just be the tip of the iceberg. 
Here are a couple of things I enjoyed in sports this week:
USC baseball shines on Saturday

For most of this season, USC baseball has been incredibly inconsistent. Defensively, they’ve held their own, but the batting order has struggled mightily against upper-tier Pac-12 competition. Last year’s standouts juniors left fielder Lars Nootbaar and third baseman Brandon Perez were supposed to take the Trojans to another level. Unfortunately, both have regressed dramatically in 2018. 
For all of their faults, USC is still capable of the occasional high-scoring performance. On Saturday, they destroyed 21-12 Arizona 12-2 on 14 hits. Nootbar, who’s currently batting .232, went 2-4 with an RBI single. 
While USC is far from being a contender in the Pac-12, games like these offer reminders of their potential. Hopefully, they can put it together more often during the final stretch of the season. 
NBA Playoffs
I always find myself enjoying the NBA Playoffs, with its more physical style of play and heightened stakes compared to the regular season. But this year’s Playoffs has a chance to really stand out — there’s a sense of uncertainty unseen since the Warriors dynasty began in 2015. 
In the Western Conference, the No. 1 seed Houston Rockets offer a direct threat to the Warriors, especially with Curry still out due to injury. The Eastern Conference is even more wide open with the Toronto Raptors, Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers looking like legitimate threats to keep LeBron’s James’ Cavaliers from a fourthstraight NBA Finals appearance. 
Sit back and enjoy the ride, because this could be the most unpredictable NBA post-season in recent memory. If the Warriors and Cavs still end up facing each other in the Finals, well then I give up.
