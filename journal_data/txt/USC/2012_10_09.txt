Dana Gioia, the Judge Widney Professor of Poetry and Public Culture at the Sol Price School of Public Policy, said he is probably the only person in the world who went to business school to become a poet.
Published · In addition to his other accolades, one of Professor Dana Gioia’s collections of poetry won the American Book Award in 2002. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
“I always wanted to be a poet, but I had to figure out how a poet made a living,” Gioia said. “I wrote at night and on weekends for all the years I was in business, and when there came a point when I had to choose between business and poetry, I chose poetry.”
Since leaving his job of 15 years as a marketing executive at General Foods to focus solely on poetry, Gioia appears to have had no trouble turning his passion into a career. He has since published four collections of poetry, one of which won the 2002 American Book Award, and has served as chairman of the National Endowment of the Arts from 2003 to 2009.
Besides his involvement at USC, Gioia’s will serve as head of the panel of literary scholars who will select the first-ever poet laureate for Los Angeles. The committee is currently evaluating candidates and will announce their appointment on Nov. 1.
“There are at least three qualities that we would like to see in a poet laureate: literary excellence, an enthusiasm for public service and a meaningful connection to Los Angeles,” Gioia said.
According to Gioia, a poet laureate will serve a practical function in terms of visiting schools, libraries and other public organizations to bring the community increased access to the arts. In addition, he believes that the position will serve a greater symbolic purpose to the city.
“Los Angeles is the center of 21st-century arts. This city is driven by creative energy,” Gioia said. “It is therefore fitting to have, as part of the civic structure, an artist whose role there symbolizes the importance of creativity, art and the imagination to a free and prosperous society.”
It is Gioia’s personal affinity for poetry that has allowed him to recognize the importance of a poet laureate’s potential contributions to Los Angeles. He believes poetry is “the most concise, expressive, and communicative way to use language,” and that it allows people to articulate what it means to be human.
Gioia accepted his first full-time university appointment at USC in 2010 and is now involved in several professional schools, including the Sol Price School of Public Policy, the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, the Thornton School of Music and the Marshall School of Business. He currently teaches an Arts and Letters poetry class and a special topics course in arts leadership and entrepreneurship.
Gioia sees his role at USC as more than just teaching in the classroom.
“Last year, I said yes to every invitation I had anywhere in the university,” he said. “I gave general talks to classes, student organizations and other community groups.”
Gioia has also partaken in several Visions and Voices programs, including an event on Monday with former U.S. poet laureate Kay Ryan.
Gioia said one of his most valuable experiences as a professor has been working with all kinds of students in multiple subject areas, an interest he has become more involved in through the USC Sidney Harman Academy for Polymathic Study. These unique opportunities for collaboration of different arts are what Gioia said have allowed USC to stand out among other universities.
“USC is not only full of energy but full of confidence that it will become better and better with each year,” Gioia said. “I find it exciting to be part of a great institution entering a golden age.”

If you think you know your tacos, you’re probably wrong.
Spend an hour listening to Jeffrey M. Pilcher talk about his new book, Planet Taco: A Global History of Mexican Food, and you will feel like a taco novice.
“Planet Taco” · University of Minnesota Professor Jeffrey M. Pilcher talks about the cultural origins of Mexican foods like tacos and burritos. – Zhaoyu Zhou | Daily Trojan
Pilcher, a professor at the University of Minnesota, spoke at Doheny Library on Tuesday in conjunction with the Spanish and Portuguese department and the history department.
Pilcher specializes in the history and culture of food from Mexico, Latin America and the Caribbean and, as a result, his talks often begin with an exploration of the taco.
“I want to look at the word taco,” Pilcher said. “If we look at the historical development of words we can have a more accurate chronology of the foods.”
It is a common conception, he said, to look at the word “taco” and credit it to the Aztec period. Pilcher then went on to list different words that are similar to “taco,” their meanings and how one might interpret them.
According to Pilcher, the taco was not mentioned as a snack until the late 19th century.
“Tacos go from absolutely invisible in the historical record to everywhere,” Pilcher said. “At this point it’s hard to go anywhere in Mexico City in the working class neighborhoods without tripping over a taco vendor of some kind.”
Pilcher said he believes the word “taco” dates back to the 18th century when it was used in reference to little explosives used to excavate silver ore in Mexican mines.
In reality, Pilcher said, “there’s quite a similarity between a chicken taquito with a good hot sauce and a stick of dynamite.”
And if you think about it, Pilcher said, it is understandable that tacos would be popular among miners.
“You can just imagine miners going down in mines and taking this as a very simple food,” Pilcher said.
Pilcher said oftentimes, when trying to understand where food originated, people attribute food items to famous personalities — like the “Earl of Sandwich.”
The taco, however, is especially important because it is a “working class food.”
“Real workers are preparing and consuming them,” Pilcher said. “We don’t need to make any story up. In fact, the taco shop became a place where people from all over Mexico could gather and meet and develop a community,” Pilcher said.
About half-way through the conversation, Pilcher changed subjects.
“Now let’s take the time to talk about burritos,” Pilcher said.
Pilcher began discussing the history of the word “burrito,” its connection with donkeys and the fact that no one in Mexico really eats burritos.
After discussing the burrito to the same degree as the taco, Pilcher began talking about the taco’s spread around the world.
“The taco appeared in Mexico City and then it spread out over the country,” Pilcher said.
Pilcher noted he does not believe that Mexican-American food is “non-authentic.”
“Just because they’re different from the foods being produced in Mexico doesn’t make them any less Mexican,” Pilcher said.
According to Pilcher, we’re used to focusing on the clash between Mexican traditional authentic food and American corporate fast food. What is lost in between, however, is the Mexican-American culture that is adapting Mexican food into their American lives.
“If we get too hung up about what’s authentic or what’s supposed to be, we’re missing out on the possibilities available to us,” Pilcher said.
Sara Carlson, a sophomore majoring in international relations,  was surprised by this aspect of the talk.
“It’s interesting that he thinks Tex-Mex food is real,” Carlson said. “I’ve never heard that before.”
After his talk, an audience member asked a question regarding the impact of food on history. And though Pilcher seemed stumped at first, he amazed the crowd with yet another historical story regarding Mexican food.
In 1838, Mexico was going through a time of great instability, according to Pilcher. Mexico was invaded by the French, who were trying to recover unpaid loans. Soon, however, Mexico found out that one of the debts was that a French pastry chef’s Empanadas had been stolen by Mexican revolutionaries.
“The Mexicans actually dubbed this invasion the ‘pastry war,’” Pilcher said.
In concluding the talk, Pilcher discussed Mexico’s reaction to the “Americanization” of their food. Pilcher said that some Mexicans believe their food has been ruined by being poorly created all over the world. Pilcher also said, however, that Peru wants to be like Mexico.
“Even though Mexico has been misrepresented this whole time, there is still a marketed interest,” he said.
Fitting with the theme, the conversation ended with free tacos for audience members.

USC received a $200,000 grant from the Fogarty International Center of the National Institutes of Health to begin planning a new Global Environmental and Occupational Health hub in Ethiopia.
Along with Addis Ababa University’s School of Public Health, the Department of Preventative Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine and the USC Institute of Global Health will spend the next two years working closely with their Ethiopian collaborators to plan a center that will investigate health problems stemming from environmental issues.
The National Institute of Health is a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and gives out many research grants, whereas the Fogarty International Center specializes in partnering the U.S. and foreign countries to conduct research on global health.
Jonathan Samet, director of the USC Institute for Global Health, is a co-principal investigator for the project along with Professor Kiros Berhane, who is originally from Ethiopia. Samet said the team had “been looking to develop collaboration in Ethiopia,” partly because of Berhane’s roots.
The two have been applying for grants for about a year and a half now for funding to establish the first GEOHealth hub.
The next year will be spent making trips to Ethiopia to collaborators there, holding a workshop for stakeholders and identify what the high-priority projects are.
“By the middle of year one we will put together a grand proposal to establishing the full GEOHealth hub,” Berhane said.
In the second year of grant funding, the other three countries that are involved in the project — Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda — will be invited to help plan the hub.
“I think what’s unique about this is that[it is] … an initiative funded by the National Institute of Health that we hope will lead on to the development of a larger center,” Samet said.
Since the GEOHealth hub is still in early stages there are little opportunities for student involvement at the present moment, but organizers said this will soon change. Once up and running, the hub will provide opportunities for students in a variety of fields such as medicine and the sciences.
Berhane also emphasized that the hub will be very “interdisciplinary,” as it involves “experts from climate change, from the healths, from exposure assessment and from some engineering aspects,” and therefore it might appeal to a variety of students, not just ones at Keck.
Julie Paul, an undergraduate student majoring in Spanish, said she believes the health hub will benefit both students at USC and those in Ethiopia.
“As someone who wants to eventually go to medical school, I think this project would be a cool thing to be involved in in a few years, and also is great for the people in Ethiopia who it will benefit,” Paul said.

Legal scholars and world-renowned economists gathered in London as part of the inaugural USC Global Conversation on Monday and Tuesday.
The two-day event titled “The Future of the Global Economy” began Monday evening in London with an opening reception hosted by Elizabeth Garrett, provost and senior vice president for academic affairs.

Garrett highlighted USC’s commitment to recruiting students overseas. USC currently enrolls more international students than any other university in the United States, she said.
“Our scholarly community — faculty, students, alumni and supporters -— extends to every continent, and we rely on this community to represent our institutional values across the world,” Garrett said in a statement. “We believe that rigorous discussion of issues that are important to governments around the world help us form meaningful connections.”
Attendees included members of the USC Alumni Club of London and various deans from the university’s schools. Also in attendance was swimmer and Trojan Gold Medalist Rebecca Soni, who spoke following a panel discussion.
Tuesday’s events began with a keynote address from British Labour Party politician Jack Straw. Following the keynote presentation was a panel discussion moderated by Lord John Eatwell, who holds several academic posts at the University of Cambridge. The panel was made up of a combination of London-based experts on the global economy and USC faculty who are also experts on the same topic. The panelists included M. Hashem Pesaran, a USC economics professor; Sir David King, director of the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford; Pip McCrostie, a vice chair at Ernst & Young; Manuel Castells, a USC professor in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism; and Straw.
Eatwell began the discussion by questioning the state of the global economy during a time of technological prosperity.
“Given all this remarkable technological change going on around us, why are we doing so badly? If things are so good, why are they so bad?” Eatwell asked the panelists.
In addition to the discussion of prosperity in certain fields and depression in others, Castells explained how the entire economy is interconnected.
“What this crisis has shown is that we are not simply a global economy, we are not simply an interdependent economy,” said Castells. “We are a network economy where everything is connected in real time through digital communication networks and therefore everything expands immediately.”
Another issue McCrostie highlighted was the lack of confidence in the financial industry.
“Probably one of the points we haven’t discussed this morning is the lack of confidence — the lack of global confidence — that the business community is feeling right now,” McCrostie said.
McCrostie said he sees growth in the global economy, though it is at low and stagnant levels.
“We’ve got to focus on what we can do to stimulate growth in a disciplined, measured way, learning the lessons of the last four years,” McCrostie said.
Pesaran also emphasized the imbalance between the financial market developments in the emerging world and the real development.
“There is no financial market in China,” Pesaran said. “The Chinese currency is not convertible. Indian currency is not convertible. There is no long-term bond market in China. There is no longterm bond market in India. You need to develop financial sectors in India and other imaginary markets.”
King, a former chief scientific adviser of the British government who currently holds posts at Oxford, Cambridge and other universities, focused the conversation on the underlying resource challenges posed by the financial crisis, citing oil production as an example.
“Oil production increased from 67 million barrels a day to 74 million barrels a day over the period from 1999 to 2005 and the price increased from $15 to $40 a barrel,” King said. “From 2005 to 2011, the price has been oscillating between $60 and $140 a barrel and that oscillation is a factor in this relatively poor attempt we’re having in regrowing our economy.”
King attributed the resource challenges to technological and behavioral inertia.
“We are damaging the global commons at an enormous rate,” King said. “Our economic system at the moment means that scarcity pushes up price and therefore we push things into nonexistence by that process.”
Eatwell ended the discussion on a more optimistic note, highlighting humankind’s ability to “bounce back” and the optimistic spirit of universities, such as USC.
“The program which USC has defined for itself, looking towards the future, points toward that fundamental optimism,” said Eatwell. “It’s an optimism that all universities fundamentally have in their DNA.”

One of the major storylines in this week’s game against Washington is the coaching battle between USC coach Lane Kiffin and Washington coach Steve Sarkisian. Kiffin and Sarkisian were both on Pete Carroll’s USC staff and are both considered offensive masterminds. Kiffin, however, is already downplaying the rivalry.
Not an option · Sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee reportedly told USC coach Lane Kiffin that he could play the cornerback position. Kiffin, however, has not seriously considered Lee’s offer. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“Once you get to the game and it’s kicked off, you forget about all that,” Kiffin said. “But it’s a healthy rivalry between the school, and [Sarkisian’s] done a great job making it competitive.”
According to Kiffin, the key to the game will be how the No. 11 Trojans respond to Washington’s home crowd. The crowd noise was a major reason why Washington upset Stanford earlier in the season.
“The concern for us on offense is handling the crowd and playing with good composure,” Kiffin said.
With USC having played three of its first five games on the road, though, the team is already accustomed to playing away from the Coliseum.
—
There’s a new positional battle brewing for the Trojans, and it’s in the secondary. Through its first five games, USC has yet to find a consistent cornerback to play opposite Nickell Robey, and they are trying out sophomore transfer Josh Shaw at the position.
“Josh Shaw has taken reps [at cornerback],” Kiffin said. “We’re just rotating all the guys in there.”
Kiffin has not been using star wide receiver sophomore Marqise Lee to address his cornerback problem, despite Lee proposing the idea on the return flight home from Utah.
“[Lee] is so valuable in the reps when the ball doesn’t go to him based on the defenses that are called, it’d be hard to take him off the field on offense,” Kiffin said.
When asked whether or not Kiffin considered him a serious option for cornerback, Lee said, “Who, Kiffin? No.”
—
Injuries that happened to several members of USC’s offense in last Thursday’s game were addressed Tuesday.
Running back Silas Redd said that it was a back issue that kept him out in the late stages of the game, but he said he felt fine today. Running back Curtis McNeal did not enter back into the game after leaving early because he did not pass a concussion test. Wide receiver Robert Woods also suffered a concussion, one that caused his mom to shut off the TV because she was so nervous. Both players said they do not feel their concussions anymore.

CBS Sports rolled out a college basketball preview Monday, featuring predictions for All-American finalists and Final Four contenders, along with a list of the top 100 players in the country.
Needed boost · Junior guard J.T. Terrell averaged 11.1 points per game in his one season at Wake Forest. His scoring is a welcomed addition for USC. – Photo courtesy of Sports Information
The Pac-12, despite being uncharacteristically weak last season, has a fair number of athletes who could end the season with some serious accolades. UCLA alone produced three players in the top 100, including No. 3 Shabazz Muhammad — that is, of course, dependent on whether or not the NCAA clears him to play. In total, the conference had nine players in the rankings. And the last of those nine, No. 98 J.T. Terrell, is set to suit up for the Trojans this season.
Normally, a Trojan making headlines for his skills on the court wouldn’t be noteworthy in the slightest. USC might not have achieved much success holistically in its men’s basketball history, but individually there’s been plenty of NBA talent. In the last 15 years, the school has sent out guys like Brian Scalabrine, Nick Young, O.J. Mayo and Nikola Vucevic.
But Terrell is an interesting case for two reasons. One, USC had its worst-ever season in terms of win-loss percentage in 2011-12. Again, poor seasons are not out of the norm for the men’s team. But last year was truly a train wreck, which has managed to derail expectations for this roster to monumentally low levels among casual hoops fans.
And second of all, and perhaps most importantly, Terrell is a transfer student who most recently played at the junior college level and very few onlookers know what to expect from the virtually unknown guard, who began his college career at Wake Forest.
With the season set to kick off Nov. 9, the assumption has long been that senior guard Jio Fontan would serve as the de facto leader of the squad. But Terrell’s national recognition from college basketball analysts begs the question — should he instead be considered USC’s top option?
In terms of who will serve as the leader of the team, Terrell has little say in the matter. The oldest, most tenured players are going to command the most respect in that regard, and Fontan is the senior starting point guard returning from a torn anterior cruciate ligament. Tennessee transfer Renaldo Woolridge is a senior, as is backup center James Blasczyk, forward Aaron Fuller, guard Greg Allen and UC Irvine transfer Eric Wise. It’s safe to say Terrell has a while to go before he’s in the running for team captain.
But on a squad chock-full of depth (yes, this year’s roster is nothing like last year’s), someone is going to have to score points during crunch time if USC wants to make plays at the end of close games. And Terrell has the raw talent and work ethic to be that guy.
Terrell is actually helped by the dismissal of likely sixth man Maurice Jones, because he’s now by far the best swingman left on the roster that can handle the ball and score the basketball. As a freshman at Wake Forest, Terrell averaged 11.1 points, including a season-high 32 points against Iowa. He has a silky-smooth step-back jumper and athleticism that should lead to a higher number of highlight reel plays for the Trojans, especially compared to the 2011-12 season.
Both his shooting and jumping abilities were in full display following his senior season of high school, when he won the North Carolina/South Carolina All-Star Dunk Contest and 3-Point Contest. He’s likely to log major minutes, and is expected to put up numbers in the mid to high teens every game.
A quick YouTube search of Terrell’s highlights only confirms what the CBS Sports pundits already know — this guy has a chance to be one of the best players in the Pac-12. And by the end of the season, I’d be surprised if he wasn’t seen that way.
Fontan is penciled in as the emotional leader and one of the team’s two or three best players after averaging 10.5 points and 3.9 assists as a junior. Impressive, yes, but to expect him to take over the offensive load seems like a bit of a stretch.
Starting center Dewayne Dedmon, meanwhile, might have the most pro potential — he’s listed as a second round pick on NBADraft.net — but he’s still too raw on both sides of the court to really be trusted down the stretch. And guys like Woolridge, Fuller and sophomore Byron Wesley will certainly play important roles and “have their shining moments,” but none have shown the capability to be big time threats. Wesley might reach that point in 2014, but he isn’t there yet.
So, by season’s end, USC’s most valuable player will be Terrell. The Trojans can compete against some of their opponents sans the junior guard, but they would really struggle to contend in the Pac-12 standings without him. He’s a major catalyst for the team’s offense and holds the key to its chances at making an NCAA tournament appearance.

Following their two-game losing streak, the Women of Troy have won three straight Pac-12 matches as they head up north to face California and No. 4 Stanford on Wednesday.
The No. 6 USC women’s volleyball team (16-2, 4-2) has bounced back nicely after a humbling weekend at the end of September, especially last Sunday’s win over upstart Arizona State.

Not only did the win provide a great morale boost for the team, but it also marked a landmark victory for USC coach Mick Haley. With the win, Haley notched his 300th win as the head coach at USC, making USC the third school he has won 300 games with.
“I liked the way we played this match [against ASU],” Haley said. “We got in a little rut and didn’t get out of it as quickly as we wanted to, but overall this team has been hurting people and they’ve been scoring at will with their left sides, so I’m glad we limited them to .140 hitting.”
The Women of Troy have displayed quite a bit of resiliency in recent weeks after falling twice to Pac-12 rivals.
“We’ve been working really hard in practice, and that’s helped for our confidence. How you play in practice determines how you play in a game,” said Hagglund.
Haley has stressed defense as the key to USC’s success, and its play at the net and passing remain an important part of its approach throughout the season.
Against Stanford, the Women of Troy face off against a team undefeated so far in Pac-12 play as they try to avenge last season’s 3-0 sweep. Stanford is first in the conference in digs per game and also ranks third in blocks, so the USC offense will need to be in fine form if its wants to challenge the Cardinal.
The Women of Troy will have to keep tabs on junior middle hitter Carly Wopat, who leads the team (and conference) in blocks per game and also ranks as the team leader in kills.
To counteract Stanford’s dominance in the middle, USC will use junior Alexis Olgard and rising freshman Alicia Ogoms.
“You’re starting to see Ogoms start to grow under her body and if Alexis keeps doing what she’s doing, that will make our defense really great,” Haley said.
USC’s defensive prowess has been the catalyst for its recent winning streak, and it will have to once again be in top form Wednesday.
The Women of Troy shouldn’t overlook a Cal squad that has been beset by injuries from the start of the season. Playing without starting libero Robin Rostratter and All-Conference opposite Correy Johnson, the Golden Bears have definitely struggled early on, but Haley points out this is still a rivalry game and a formidable challenge.
“This is the hardest trip, going to the Bay Area and knowing how hard they’re studying right now,” Haley said about this upcoming week. “Stanford is always difficult to beat on their home court.”
Haley said the weekend could be a good barometer for some of the team’s young players, however.
“We have a good matchup to see how we do because they’re also starting four freshmen,”
Haley said. “Having a late match Friday night against Cal will be a big challenge for us, and it will allow us to see what we’re made of.”

In 1962, things were quite different in the land of Troy. Apart from gas being $0.31 a gallon and West Side Story being the top movie of the year, USC football was, to put it mildly, nonexistent.
“No one expected us to be good,” star running back Willie Brown said. “No one had heard of USC before.”
Best of the best · Led by legendary coach John McKay, the 1962 Trojans won the school’s fifth national championship. McKay would win four titles during his famed USC tenure from 1960-1975. The 1962 team featured USC Hall of Famers Willie Brown and Hal Bedsole. – Photo courtesy of Sports Information
After that year, however, every sports fan in the country knew what USC was. Members of that 1962 team gathered Monday at the Annenberg Auditorium for the 50th reunion of the illustrious squad, one that won the school its fifth national championship.
The Trojans, who have claimed 11 national titles in their illustrious football history — among the most in the country — are perennial contenders. That wasn’t always the case, though. Before head coach John McKay arrived, USC hadn’t won a title since 1939, and the team had seen its fair share of struggles.
Before the days of ESPN and 24-hour coverage of all things college football, USC had become an afterthought, a non-factor in the grand scheme of things. Heading into McKay’s third year at the helm, the team had gone a combined 8-11-1 in 1960 and 1961. Expectations were dismal.
“We had lost the first couple of years with McKay,” fullback Ken Del Conte said. “Going into my senior year, we were excited, but no one thought we could go out and do what we were able to accomplish.”
Though the now-legendary McKay struggled to win in his first two seasons, he was able to excel in recruiting, an area in which he was very successful during his USC tenure, and it paid off in his third season.
“I had the opportunity to go to any school I wanted to,” Brown said. “I came to USC mainly because of two reasons: I was a mama’s boy, and John McKay.”
Brown also credited legendary baseball coach Rod Dedeaux as a reason for choosing USC. In addition to playing on the football team, Brown started on USC’s baseball team in 1963, which also won a national championship.
Unlike 2012’s version of the Trojans, little attention was given to USC early in the season until it upset highly ranked Iowa in Iowa City. That same week, UCLA pulled off another upset over the No. 1 ranked Ohio State Buckeyes. This, combined with the Trojans’ surprising start, was the first indication things might go their way.
“Coming home on the bus, we heard that UCLA had beaten the No. 1 team in the nation, Ohio State,” Del Conte said. “We looked at each other and said, ‘Hey, we’re 2-0. Why can’t we win all the rest and win this thing?’ And that’s what happened.”
Though the team was blessed with talented players, namely Brown and wide receiver Hal Bedsole, who is in the College Football Hall of Fame, it was McKay’s innovative offense that is credited with the drastic turnaround.
“We won the championship in 1962 not because we practiced hard,” Brown said. “We won the national championship because John McKay installed the I-formation.”
With the I-formation came the famed “Student Body Left” toss play that became iconic in college football. The play is aptly named because of the large amount of blockers that pull to one side of the field.
In addition to his coaching prowess, McKay was known for being an excellent motivator. And fear was his most effective mean for motivation.
“John McKay was a dictator.,” Brown said. “People were scared to hell out of him … When he walked down the street you crossed to the other side. We all were afraid of him. But with that came a great deal of respect.”
That respect became the foundation of what was the beginning of a football dynasty at USC. The Trojans finished the season 11-0, including a thrilling 42-37 Rose Bowl victory over No. 2 Wisconsin to win the Associated Press national championship, the school’s fifth at the time and first of four that USC would win during McKay’s 15-year stint as coach.
Though few parallels can be drawn between this year’s version of the Trojans and the 1962 team, players from both teams hope that this season ends in a similar fashion: a national title.

Anyone who’s been to a Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra concert has enjoyed a view of the Alex Theatre.
Classically trained · USC alum Andrew Norman joins the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra this season as a composer-in-residence. – | Photo courtesy of Andrew Norman
One of Glendale’s foremost cultural centers and historic landmarks, the theater was originally used for  vaudeville acts and motion picture screenings. The Alex features a classic cinema style billboard and outdoor courtyard. Yet, the inside of the theater provides a sophisticated atmosphere with Greek and Egyptian details and boasts a finely tuned acoustic quality.
But just as the Alex features contemporary and classical elements, the 44-year-old LACO does not fit the mold of a crotchety old orchestra. In its new season, LACO blends classical masters’ work with modern composers and pushes musical boundaries.
[Correction: A previous version of this story stated the LACO is 15 years old. The orchestra is 44 years old.]
As it attempts to bring young audiences to time-tested music, LACO offers Campus to Concert Hall season passes that cost less than a full tank of gas and allow students to experience live orchestral music. LACO also has a strong partnership with USC’s Thornton School of Music. The unique LACO-USC Thornton Strings Mentorship Program gave USC student Mary Reed the opportunity to perform with LACO last April.
LACO’s Oct. 7 opening night performance of Ravel and Beethoven featured the West Coast premieres of young musicians Andrew Norman and James Matheson’s pieces. Through the preludes, audience members learned how Alexander Calder’s iconic sculpture “La Grande Vitesse” in Grand Rapids, Mich. inspired Norman, a USC graduate and current LACO composer-in-residence, to write “Great Swiftness.” The new interpretation of the sculpture uses shifting melodies to lend a sense of movement to the piece and to reflect Calder’s undulating work.
For James Matheson, it was Werner Herzog’s film Encounters at the End of the World that gave him the inspiration for his piece “True South.” The unusual inspiration seems to keep the old musical form fresh.
The program opened with a stunning Ravel piece, “Piano Concerto in G Minor,” where Jeffrey Kahane conducted and played the piano. Aside from being a testament to Kahane’s skill as a musician and conductor, the concerto stuns with three distinct movements. The first movement features a sunny melody line interspersed with a few passing clouds. In contrast, the second movement fades to sunset and sounds like a mourning for a lost day. After a long grand pause, the third movement picks up with a bittersweet sunrise that incorporates some sunshine into the somber mood.
Norman’s “The Great Swiftness,” the next performance, provided a stark contrast to Ravel’s classical style. “Great Swiftness” highlights the orchestra’s ability to change styles and features swooping sounds reminiscent of a pinball rolling down the machine. Unlike strictly classical pieces, Norman’s music incorporates abstract sounds, relying more on feeling and tone then melody and harmony.
Matheson’s “True South” followed and, once again, highlighted LACO’s versatility, adding rhythmic layers on top of sustained pitches. A lack of silence makes the piece  all the more prominent with its dynamic and tonical contrasts. At times, the sound is as gentle and ephemeral as soap bubbles but can change just as quickly to a sonorous roar.
Following a brief intermission, the orchestra welcomed Augustin Hadelich to perform Beethoven’s “Violin Concerto in D Major.” A classic Beethoven piece, the music is lively with undertones of storminess. Hadelich’s solos are like caramel candies for the ears: They melt and evolve to highlight these rich undertones and leave a lingering sweetness. The orchestra beautifully balanced Hadelich’s cadenzas, as the piece took on a conversational yet majestic tone.
Afterward, Hadelich also treated the audience to an encore performance of Bach’s “Sonata No. 2 Andante.” This performance was the icing on LACO’s already-enjoyable evening.
But LACO connected with music lovers before and after the performance. The orchestra offers free Concert Preludes with the composers before each show. These chats are not just for music buffs: audience members get to know the composers by asking questions. The informal preludes also give background on the inspiration for the pieces and provide a context for listening to the music.
After the concert, KUSC broadcasts LACO’s entire 2011-12 season on Sundays at 4 p.m. on 91.5 FM, giving everyone a chance to enjoy LACO’s dynamic, innovative music.

College is never quiet.
The sounds of police sirens and cars honking from the street echo through the thin walls of the dorms. The Ronald Tudor Campus Center constantly buzzes with busy chatter, and even the library hums with rustling paper and clicking keyboards. It’s rare to find a time to sit back and enjoy an actual melody.

But tucked away in the Trojan Family Room, students and faculty alike breathe in pure music with no distractions for an hour each week.
It’s not just any music either — it’s probably the best music you’ve never heard. Students at the Thornton School of Music perform classical and even jazz pieces in the calming atmosphere at the United University Church every Wednesday in a program dubbed “Music at Noon.” Here, audiences can enjoy the hum of cellos, pianos and violins reverberating down the aisle of wooden pews as sunlight gleams through stained glass windows. The performances have a very fantastical feel; it’s almost hard to believe the performance takes place on a college campus. The tall wooden ceiling and sparkling melodies feel like something out of a dream.
[Correction: A previous version of this story stated “Music at Noon” at the United University Church occurs every Tuesday. The program takes place every Wednesday.]
Instead of the familiar works of Bach and Mozart, the students choose more current pieces, such as “Two Mythological Birds,” written last summer and performed last Wednesday by second year doctoral violin performance student Clara Kim. She also played “Evergreen Steps,” a song based on a jazz tune written this fall, with two other students in a trio. Many of the pieces include novel rhythms that keep listeners engaged and interested.
Students typically volunteer for the program in order to gain more experience playing to an informal, casual audience of appreciative peers.
“It’s great to get these more friendly environment opportunities to be able to try new pieces and to bring them to anyone who happens to be walking by,” Kim said.
Brian Head, assistant dean for curriculum at Thornton, currently runs “Music at Noon.” James Smith, the previous organizer of the program and a classical guitar instructor, passed away two years ago after a long battle with cancer, and the program has been trying to maintain its previous quality and popularity ever since.
“He was a great visionary, a person of huge intellect and interest,” said current graduate student and assistant in organizing the program Mak Grgic. “He was like a big spinning wheel that gathers people along the way, does all the work, and brings people in.”
Head, who had Smith as a teacher and watched him create the thriving program, was able to lead the concert series in its legacy.
“One of the challenges of a music school is to provide opportunities for students to play outside of the academic constraints,” Head said. “But we work very hard to transition students into real world performance opportunities.”
Thornton aims to bring the USC community together by facilitating programs such as “Music at Noon.” The performances allow students from different areas in Thornton to work together and collaborate on musical projects.
Also, by giving students an opportunity to see their classmates and friends perform for free in a casual setting, Thornton hopes to engage the USC community at large and raise awareness of the work it has been doing.
“What’s been consistent is the high level of performance,” Head said. “The playing is extraordinary. It was something you would imagine hearing at any major concert hall. The level of talent is so great here that it’s a shame that we don’t have more opportunities to hear the students play.”
In the future, program performers and organizers hope to fill the entire church by attracting audiences of up to 100 people to help expand the concert series and gain recognition.
Since the concert features current students playing newer melodies, the up-close-and-personal feel will likely help classical music gain a little more popularity among students. The concert series runs throughout the fall semester and is very laid back — there is no application process in order to play at “Music at Noon,” the performers stick around after the show and there is always free food available for audience members once the music has finished.
Whether audiences enjoy the concert in the cozy Trojan Family Room or the sanctuary of the United University Church, it’s clear that “Music at Noon” represents a much-needed period of appreciation and recognition for the arts, as well as a moment to relax and unwind in the average college student’s busy schedule. At a school with a huge emphasis on academic and sports, it might be valuable to spend some time experiencing the other strong aspects of the university.
Maybe “Music at Noon” will help students enjoy more of the sounds Thornton has to offer.

Hot off of last week’s presidential debate, everyone has the November election on their minds. The Huffington Post cited the debate as the most tweeted event in U.S. political history, clearly showing that it’s easy to get a message — even one about Big Bird — across to viewers.

Unfortunately, recent political films haven’t quite managed to impact audiences to such a large extent.
Modern film is not short of political works. We have biopics, documentaries and many true stories recounting past and present events. But these films aren’t reaching the audiences they need to in order to influence today’s political climate.
In an election year, when filmmakers have the opportunity to take advantage of their creative medium to voice opinions and administer their influence, the political message is getting lost.
It’s about time that filmmakers and studios alike manned up, tackled contemporary politics and distributed these works far and wide.
But this isn’t happening right now and it can be attributed to two things: One, some films lack relevant content that relates to modern issues, and two, other films have strong opinions to share on the state of our world but fail to reach a broader audience.
Take period pieces for example. Steven Spielberg’s Lincoln is a biopic that follows the life of former President Abraham Lincoln in the wake of the Civil War. Ben Affleck’s Argo, in turn, documents the 1979 Iran hostage crisis.
These films are undeniably political in their subject matter, but don’t speak to the modern world. Lincoln and Argo deal with issues of race, war and international relations — all relevant issues — but audiences might not draw connections between the past and the present. Oftentimes, these themes simply fail to transcend into contemporary politics.
Small-scale, low-budget documentaries, in turn, face the opposite problem. Many documentaries tackle controversial modern issues, but don’t have the funding or distribution to get their strong points of view across to wider audiences. Writer-director Eugene Jarecki’s The House I Live In, for example, investigates the ongoing War on Drugs, arguing that the battle is not a superficial drug problem, but rather the result of a slew of socio-economic factors.
Here, the problem lies not in content but in distribution. In fact, Jarecki’s point of view is so strong that at times the film feels heavy-handed as it attempts to garner sympathy from the viewer. The House I Live In sets out to say something about the state of our world, and it does — but it only screened in two theaters, bringing in a mere $16,453, according to Box Office Mojo. Again, the political sentiment is there, but if hardly anyone sees the film, how much of a difference can it make?
The House I Live In doesn’t stand a chance against Lincoln or Argo, which are backed by big names and even bigger studios, nor does it have the same credibility as Academy Award-winning director Kathryn Bigelow’s upcoming Zero Dark Thirty.
But, strangely, Zero faces the biggest issue of all.
This film is controversial in its subject matter, tackling the killing of Osama Bin Laden, and has the name and distribution to make it accessible and well-known. Yet, Zero stands as a testament to cinema’s failure to push the limit with political films, as it caves instead to the studio system and political pressure. At its simplest, Zero — and the team behind it — is a pushover.
The much-anticipated film was scheduled to hit theaters before the upcoming presidential election, but was later pushed back to Dec. 19 — mostly because of accusations that the filmmakers had access to classified information about the attack and because it wanted to avoid being seen as a propaganda piece.
I don’t know the filmmakers’ political affiliations, but Zero serves as the perfect platform for the creative team to use their power to say something that could potentially affect the election. If the filmmakers support President Barack Obama’s re-election, the film could take a congratulatory tone, and if they don’t, the film could be more critical. Instead, Zero shies away from the election, when it should be tackling the issue head on.
Of course, filmmakers aren’t completely to blame. There’s an entire studio system working against controversial films. The film industry is a business after all, and accordingly studios and filmmakers alike have to take political pressures into consideration.
I don’t think the team behind Zero is composed of a bunch of cowards. Film as a medium, however, should be used to express strong, and sometimes unwelcomed, opinions. If these views can’t be expressed when they’re meant to be expressed — in this case, before the election — then, to some degree, the industry is enabling censorship.
Not all political films have to reflect upon the modern state of politics, but in an election year, filmmakers need to create publicly accessible works that are relevant to today’s economy, social issues and international relations. Here’s hoping for that four years from now.

In a time when the horror genre has hit an all-time low, V/H/S reminds audiences of what they’ve been missing.
As an anthology film, V/H/S features individual segments of varying quality, ranging from reasonably innovative and original to truly terrifying. At times, the content of these segments far surpasses the quality of any traditional horror film in the last 10 years, largely because it embraces truly dark thematic material.
Masked madame · Kate Lyn Sheil stars in “Second Honeymoon,” V/H/S’s second segment. The installment proves one of the best of the entire film and relies on a realistic rather than fantastical plot to scare viewers. – | Photo courtesy of Magnet Releasing
But when all is said and done, V/H/S is a true example of a film only as good as the sum of its parts. The assembly of the film is the largest flaw, and viewers are compelled to view V/H/S as a collection of short films rather than as a single, cohesive piece.
The body of the film contains five segments, and a sixth framing segment which establishes the anthology premise: a group of ragtag criminals invade an allegedly empty house in search of a crucial video tape. To find it, they must sift through a huge stack of VHS tapes, and these tapes contain the five core segments of the film.
Each segment has its own director, writer and crew, but they all share a common “found footage” style. The contrast from segment to segment creates one of the most intriguing elements of the film but also one of its chief weaknesses — the innovation evident in the first and second stories is largely absent from the third, reappears in the fourth and disappears again in the fifth. As such, audiences are left bored and jaded by the decreased quality in the third and fifth segments.
The framing segment, “Tape 56,” functions quite well as the film’s overarching story; it’s highly unnerving at times, but employs a slow-burn technique that allows us to feel somewhat more comfortable upon returning to the original narrative from one of the main stories. The main segment does have a satisfyingly creepy culmination — although that culmination comes too early — and “Tape 56” awkwardly ends before the fifth and final segment, making it an incomplete framing device.
“Amateur Night,” the first story in the body of the film, is quite possibly the best. It chronicles the simple story of three college-aged guys who go out to a bar and bring girls back to their hotel room. But this seemingly innocent premise is quickly transformed into something profoundly disturbing. “Amateur Night” features a nearly perfect pace, unfolding gradually but eventually unleashing horrifying moments that can make an audience full of grown men scream.
“Amateur Night” makes for an extraordinary first impression when watching the film but creates problems for subsequent segments, which fail to measure up to the quality of the first.
The second segment, “Second Honeymoon,” honestly tries to measure up to the horror-quality found in “Amateur Night” and is likely the next best of the film. This portion of V/H/S unfolds at a tortuously slow pace, much like the first segment, and involves a couple with a seemingly troubled relationship going on a road trip. There’s considerable innovation in the use of the found-footage premise in this segment, which organically generates much of the suspense. “Second Honeymoon” distinguishes itself by totally avoiding all references to the supernatural, instead relying on disturbingly real human behavior to unnerve the audience.
The first two segments are followed by a drastic drop in quality with “Tuesday the 17th,” which riffs on conventional ’80s slasher flicks: a group of teens ventures out into the woods for a risque weekend, only to discover the site of several grisly murders committed years earlier. This third segment has, by far, the weakest dialogue and performances and comes off as incredibly amateurish compared to the preceding sections of the film. It does have an interesting visual flair, but the section elicits more curiosity about how the visual effects are accomplished than actual fear.
Thankfully, the film picks back up with the fourth segment, “The Sick Thing that Happened to Emily When She Was Younger.” This segment uses a webcam conceit to delineate the story of an off-kilter long-distance relationship between two young people. Their video chat interactions comprise the whole running time of the segment. Though the use of the webcam ends up being more of a gimmick than a valid storytelling device, the segment nonetheless has terrific scares and a sharp, unpredictable storyline.
The film concludes with the fifth segment, “10/31/98,” an enjoyable piece that, unfortunately, loses most of its suspense after the first few minutes. It involves a group of friends arriving at a Halloween party to find the house eerily empty, though audiences quickly realize it might not be so empty after all. “10/31/98” generates strong jump scares and moments of surprising levity as well as a strong ending that would work well as a transition into another segment, but unfortunately, the film ends there, without returning to the framing device or providing a truly satisfying climax.
As such, the film’s strongest elements are individual segments, and the whole lacks cohesion and punch. Nonetheless, three of the individual segments are so strong that those weaknesses seem irrelevant in comparison to a momentary reinvigoration of the horror genre.
Just saw this a little over a week ago and I agree: the entirety of the movie is so-so, but three or so of the fragmented VHS segments were very well done and saves the movie.

USC junior guard J.T. Terrell was named No. 98 on CBS Sports’ list of the top 100 NCAA basketball players on Monday. Terrell, who was recruited to Wake Forest as a freshman, joins this year’s squad as a transfer in an effort to improve on last year’s 6-26 record. Terrell most recently played for Peninsula Junior College in Washington state. He was ranked as the top junior college player in America by Swanny’s Roundball Review.
In high school, Terrell was highly recruited and was named the No. 49 player in America by ESPN. As a freshman, he led his high school to the 2A state title in North Carolina. During his senior year, Terrell was one of the top scorers in the country, averaging 30 points per game.
The 20-year-old junior is one of many Pac-12 players on the list. The No. 3 ranked player, shooting forward Shabazz Muhammad, attends UCLA as a freshman, as does his teammate, No. 20 ranked point guard Kyle Anderson. The Pac-12 gets more representation on the list in the form of No. 36 Colorado junior shooting forward Andre Robinson, No. 42 Arizona senior guard Mark Lyons and No. 46 Cal shooting guard Allen Crabbe.
The Trojans will look to incorporate Terrell into their system as they hope to make improvements under head coach Kevin O’Neill. They open the season against Coppin State on Nov. 9 at the Galen Center.

As winter approaches, many students are eagerly flooding the pharmacy to get their flu shots. Few people, however, give enough thought to the negative aspects of the shot.
Besides causing side effects like fever, headache and coughing – symptoms recipients of the shot hope to avoid in the first place – the influenza vaccine also contains many dangerous chemicals.
Trace amounts of mercury, formaldehyde and aluminum, have all appeared in some types of the flu shot—toxins linked to developmental and behavioral disorders, as well as Alzheimer’s disease. We strive to keep these compounds out of our food, water and children’s mouths, but don’t even think to check for their presence in the flu shot.
Animal rights activists also take issue with the flu shot because the vaccine is often cultured in fertilized chicken eggs. According to the Center for Consumer Freedom, it takes three eggs to produce one vaccine. The Center for Disease Control wants 70% of Americans to be vaccinated. This requires nearly 645 million chicken eggs, placing excessive demands on an industry already condemned for raising birds in deplorable conditions.
Perhaps most importantly, researchers have argued that excessive use of the flu vaccine and other anti-flu drugs can create “super viruses.” Because the vaccine knocks out most strains of influenza, only those stronger, mutated strains survive to reproduce, ultimately making deadlier types of flu more prevalent.
There are ways to prevent the flu and still avoid these negative consequences. Getting one’s daily recommended dose of Vitamin D, for example, stimulates multiple kinds of immune system cells that attack and destroy viruses such as influenza. The body absorbs nearly all the vitamin D it needs by spending just 10 minutes a day in the sun. The vitamin also exists naturally in foods such as eggs, fish and mushrooms.
Flu vaccines do help prevent the contraction of influenza; however, for young people who have strong immune systems to begin with, they may pose a pointless risk. In any case, students should make an effort to learn more about the vaccine before they allow its injection into their bodies.
Has the author taken a science class? Spoken to some physicians? Researched the concept of herd immunity? 
This is an utter puff piece that no decent editor should have allowed to be published, “opinion” or not.

Unfortunately when walking across campus, you’ll find many men wearing frat tanks and shorts. Although their clothing decisions aren’t overwhelmingly disappointing, they could add a little more variation to their outfits.
It would be refreshing to see college men walking around USC in trendy attire. Here are some quick tips to keep in mind when trading in the standard block-colored tanks and shorts for far more interesting clothing combinations.
The first suggestion for mixing things up is to add blazers to your options. Before you put on a blazer, switch the tanks for casual buttoned shirts or printed T-shirts. Following the separation from the tank, you should let your shorts have a day off and sport blue or black jeans.
A black blazer is fashion savvy but isn’t adventurous and, quite frankly, too standard. Luckily, you can easily upgrade from black by choosing a dark blue blazer with gold buttons. This look is still subtle but adds a little more spice and requires some courage. A great place to look for these styles is Ralph Lauren; the intricate crest on the front is an added bonus to your look.
If you really want to radiate style, you should play with daring colors and textures. Go out of your comfort zone and try velvet, which is a classy way to wear bright colors. A dark red velvet blazer may sound strange but it’s a showstopper when well-worn.
Last but not least, colored pants are also a great way to add an edge to your outfit. Stay away from wearing a colored blazer with colored pants unless it happens to be an exceptional combination. If the outfit is loaded with too much color, you could look like you’re trying too hard. Red and dark blue are colors to keep in mind when choosing pants. H&M is a great place to explore when searching for colorful pants.

Los Angeles might have a notorious reputation as a driving city, but the city closed some of its roads Sunday in order to make room for vehicles that don’t guzzle gas.
The occasion was CicLAvia, a semi-annual public festival designed to transform the congested, polluted streets of Los Angeles into a safe place to walk, play, skate and ride a bike.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
Dubbed “LA’s largest block party,” CicLAvia offered extraordinary appeal for USC students — this time, the final stretch ran parallel to campus — but beyond a brief Dept. of Public Safety email informing students of a road closure, the event was hardly advertised by USC at all.
Though USC, and its students in particular, could benefit immensely from engaging with the burgeoning L.A. bike culture represented by CicLAvia, the university seems intent on keeping its distance.
For example, USC’s participation in the festival did not extend beyond coordinating traffic regulation with CicLAvia organizers, in contrast with the involvement of a variety of small businesses, restaurants and landmarks along the route.
The university does little to promote or publicize the multiple other biking events that take place in Los Angeles each year, including LA Critical Mass — the largest community bike ride in the country, which takes place on the last Friday of every month.
Even within our own walls, the university frequently portrays biking as a nuisance, despite its crucial role in meeting USC’s housing needs in buildings farther from campus. Every year it seems the amount of space in which students can legally ride their bikes on campus decreases. The University Park Health Center reports that 33.4 percent of students use their bicycles on or around campus at least once a week, but cyclists were only apportioned about a fifth of Trousdale Parkway during the construction of bike lanes last summer.
This makes little sense. USC prides itself on positive community engagement and on making Los Angeles a healthier, better city. Promoting bike culture is a cheap, easy way to accomplish these goals through pollution reduction, diversification of city transportation and the growth of an underappreciated recreational activity that can contribute beneficially to fitness, peer bonding and mental health.
By embracing the L.A. bike scene, USC would also expose its students to a segment of L.A. culture of which most Trojans are woefully ignorant.
Los Angeles is ideal for biking. Good weather year-round means bikes are always a viable option for cheap, long-distance transport or an alternative workout. Bike racks are readily available at or near the vast majority of businesses, restaurants and public parks, as well as on the front end of every bus in the city.
Southern California, meanwhile, abounds with opportunities for student cyclists to take a break from their typical recreational pursuits and to get to know their community better. These include de facto street festivals like CicLAvia; city cycling hubs like the Bicycle Kitchen, where visitors can learn to repair or build their own bikes using spare parts; and cycling races, like the UCLA “Shut Up Legs!” Road Race that took place in February.
Too often, I hear students complaining about how they can’t explore Los Angeles because they don’t have a car. I’m more afraid of missing out because I don’t own a bike.
USC openly and actively promotes engagement with Los Angeles as a means of bettering itself, its surroundings and the experiences of its students during their time here. But we’re missing out on a distinctly Angeleno cultural revolution happening all around us — simply because we haven’t given biking the chance it deserves.
Though it might be too late for us to grab our bikes and parade down the middle of Figueroa Street for CicLAvia, movement forward is just getting started. If we start exploring bike culture now, who knows? We might even turn things around in time for next year’s block party.

Biking is a nuisance when bikers fail to exercise proper riding etiquette and/or disregard traffic laws.  Distracted riding while on a cell phone.  Going against the flow of traffic.  Riding through crosswalks when the “Don’t Walk” sign is already flashing.  Etc.  Sound familiar?
Such improper biking is a big issue given the congestion on/around USC.  Biker-pedestrian collisions are far too common.  USC students (like many other cyclists) need to learn how to ride properly.  It’s not taught (there’s no licensing for bicycles), and college students in general aren’t known for common sense or restraint.
A big part of Critical Mass is taking over the streets and blowing through red lights.  That’s not the type of cycling attitude you want to foster at USC.
That said, it’s disappointing that USC wasn’t more engaged with CicLAvia.  At worst, it was a great opportunity to showcase USC’s beautiful campus and promote USC-owned eateries (e.g., The Lab).  It would have been nice, for example, to have the greatest marching band in the history of the universe serenade riders from the steps of DCC. 
Look into the MyFig project.  It might be stalled given the disbanding of Community Redevelopment Agencies.  I think it’s now in the hands of LA DOT.  MyFig plans call for segregated/protected bike lanes from USC to downtown.  USC (and the students) should do what they can to push that project forward.
As noted by another commenter, USC is now served by rail transit — a great option for carless students to explore more of LA.
Miss Bessey makes a great point, but unfortunately even she misses the fact that the newly-operational Metro Expo Line HAS a bike path component.  Most of it is on City streets, but you can take the bike path from USC and connect to the bike path at Ballona Park in Culver City, which will take you to the ocean.  Expo Phase II has begun construction, and that also includes a bike path (+ ped path), which means USC students will be able to take their bikes to Santa Monica (Third Street Promenade, Pier, etc.) in a few years!  If someone wants to write an article about bike riding, that person should check out the bike plans in the area.  There are many sources.  Thanks!
I find the cartoon offensive to the LGBTQ community.   It should be removed!
Great editorial! Coincides well with today’s LA Times story that suggests we might see monthly CicLAvia events in Los Angeles. http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/10/las-ciclavia-bike-ride-might-become-monthly-event.html

Though debate over capital punishment is primarily framed as a moral issue, an upcoming ballot measure that would eliminate California’s death penalty reveals an important sub-issue that voters should consider: the potential economic benefits of banning the death penalty.
In light of its weighty costs and negligible benefits, abolishing the death penalty by voting “yes” on Proposition 34 simply makes sense for the future of the state and its taxpayers.
Prop. 34 would replace the death penalty with a life sentence in prison with no opportunity for parole. For an increasingly struggling state economy, this makes huge financial sense. California’s death penalty is a money guzzler: A study spearheaded by U.S. Ninth Circuit Judge Arthur Alarcón revealed that the state has spent $4 billion on capital punishment and associated costs, such as increased security for inmates and legal representation in lengthy and expensive death penalty trials, since the Death Penalty Act went into effect in 1978. That comes to $184 million spent annually.
And for all its costs, the state’s death penalty is quite fruitless. In California, the average death penalty case takes 25 years from conviction to execution because of the exhaustive process of trials and delays. Many prisoners don’t even make it to the end of the process — of the 92 death row inmates who have died since 1978, dozens died while waiting for legal representation and court dates. Only 13 were actually executed. If you do the math, that’s $308 million per execution.
Not to mention, the fact that only 13 death row inmates have been executed in the last 34 years debunks the pro-death penalty claim that keeping inmates alive fills state prisons beyond their capacities. Overcrowding is a legitimate problem, but capital punishment isn’t the solution. It’s just a big investment with few returns.
Another reason to support Prop. 34 is that the estimated $1 billion it would save over the next five years could be put to better use. The ballot measure proposes the institution of the Savings, Accountability and Full Enforcement for California Act, which would appropriate $100 million to update forensic technology, hire more law enforcement personnel and ultimately solve more crimes.
The purpose of law enforcement is to solve crimes and make people safer; the ultimate reason for prisons is not for punishment but for safeguarding the outside world from convicted criminals. So by draining millions of dollars from forensic laboratories and police stations, the death penalty is pragmatically counter-intuitive. The $100 million from Prop. 34’s SAFE fund, along with the money saved by eliminating capital punishment, would be more effective in fighting crime than the lethal injection of a criminal already behind bars.
Voting “no” on the measure would perpetuate a policy that spends excessive time and money on a handful of criminals already in custody, which does not improve Californians’ safety nor save them tax dollars.
Prop. 34 is an economically and pragmatically sound ballot measure. Whether or not a voter supports the death penalty from a moral standpoint, it makes little sense to throw millions of dollars at a policy that doesn’t accomplish its goals.

Thanks  Adrienne Visani for writing this article.  Prop 34 will replace death penalty with life in prison without the possibility of parole
YES on Prop 34 will save 130 million dollars each year without releasing one single prisoner
YES on Prop 34 will mandate criminals to work to pay restitution to victims’ families
YES on Prop 34 will invest million of dollars saved by ending the death penalty in catching more killers.
YES on Prop 34 takes away the risk of executing innocent people.  
Please vote YES on 34 to make California safe.  Thanks
This column repeats several distortions that supporters of this referendum have repeated for months, most without any real scrutiny.  First of all, the Alarcon-Mitchell study was never peer reviewed, does not even take into account the amount saved by state when defendants plead guilty to avoid a special circumstances trial altogether and is contradicted by the legislative analyst who places the cost of capital punishment at 130 million annually.  The LA also indicates that this figure might be off by “many tens of millions of dollars”.  Nobody has any idea what the death penalty costs but supporters of this referendum are hoping low information voters will buy this conflated figure.  LWOP does not exist.  Jerry Brown just signed a law changing sentencing guidelines for juveniles who had been given LWOP that influenced 300 individuals. 100 million over three years for “cold case” investigation is a joke.  The LAPD budget for a year is 1.2 BILLION dollars.  Even if they got all 30 million in money from the AG, that is meaningless.  34 also supposedly forces all former death row inmates to work towards restitution, an aspect that 34 proponents know is unworkable and will be ignored by the Corrections Dept. I’m no fan of the death penalty, but dishonesty towards the voters and stupidity on the part of the media who blindly prints these misleading and false statistics earns a “NO” on 34
