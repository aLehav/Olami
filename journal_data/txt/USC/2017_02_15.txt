President C.L. Max Nikias announced on Wednesday that the Campaign for USC will reach its $6 billion fundraising goal nearly 18 months ahead of schedule, according to USC News. Due to its success, the campaign will be extended five more years through Dec. 31, 2021.
Half of the funds will go toward the University’s endowment, which currently stands at $4.6 billion. The remaining money will be used for new buildings, labs and expanding research. So far, the funds have created 100 new faculty positions, endowed 19 new research centers and institutions and raised USC’s financial aid pool to $330 million annually, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The Los Angeles Times reported that more than 322,000 people donated to the campaign. Non-alumni donations made up for 64 percent of the funds raised, while $2.2 billion was donated by alumni and $1.9 billion by parents.
The Campaign for USC aims to advance USC’s academic priorities and expand the University’s positive impact on the local and global community. When it began in 2011, the campaign was considered the largest fundraising goal in the history of higher education. It was also the third time USC had set a record-high campaign goal.
USC has raised as much money in the last 6 1/2 years as it had during the last 6 1/2 decades combined. Since 2013, USC has ranked in the county’s top three universities for annual fundraising, next to Harvard University and Stanford University.

Students from Delta Phi Epsilon, USC’s professional foreign service and international relations fraternity, lined one side of Trousdale Parkway with postcards on Wednesday, while Trojan Advocates for Political Progress helped students make phone calls on the other side.
Delta Phi Epsilon and TAPP hosted an event Wednesday called “Postcards for Representatives,” which encouraged students to contact their representatives regarding political issues.
Sloane Martin, a freshman majoring in international relations and a new member of Delta Phi Epsilon, said that the event gives  a unique opportunity to those who believe their voices have been silenced after the election.
“In this current political state, a lot of people feel like their voices have been silenced,” Martin said. “It’s really important to give people a platform for them to express how they feel … [and] to remind people that they do have a voice and they do have a say.”
Alex Bosch, a freshman majoring in international relations and global economy and a new member of Delta Phi Epsilon, said that because many students’ feelings about the current political climate vary, they chose to leave the postcards blank and allow students to write what they wish.
“One of the things we’re trying to do is provide an outlet to get [out] anger, frustration or appreciation for a senator,” Bosch said. “We’re providing free postcards and free postage — write one and we’ll mail it out for you. It’s just another way to get your voice heard past Twitter and Facebook because as we’ve seen, those sources are only so efficient, and so there’s something about a handwritten letter that has even more of an impact.”
Alec Vandenberg, a freshman studying public policy who is also the founder of TAPP and a writer for the Daily Trojan, said that the event comes off the heels of a similar event that the club hosted during the anti-Muslim ban rally at Tommy Trojan on Feb. 3.
“We were able to distribute 300 leaflets talking about how to contact Congress, so we wanted to do something similar,” Vandenberg said. “Some new issues have come up since last time we did it, so today we are focusing on healthcare and making sure Obamacare isn’t pulled away too quickly and that people are still covered. We’re focusing on different issues such as climate change in regards to keeping America in the Paris Climate Agreement, making sure we maintain investments in sustainable energy and renewable resources and things of that nature.”
Vandenberg said he encourages everyone to use their voice to call their representatives.
“Everyone call Congress. It’s really important to have your voice heard, it’s really easy, it only takes a few minutes and civic engagement continues despite the results of the election,” Vandenberg said. “We as students have power, and we have a voice.”
Delta Phi Epsilon Philanthropy Director Sheriden Smith, a junior studying international relations and Central European studies, said that the fraternity spearheaded the event to spread awareness about political activism.
“Since we are a nonpartisan organization and we have no political preference of any kind, this is just a medium in which students can get their voice to be heard because in this political climate we see a lot of people who aren’t exactly liberal, who aren’t exactly conservative, and we see a lot of those people in the middle who don’t know how to express their political feelings,” Smith said.
Smith added that they were actually inspired by a similar errors put on by the Women’s March in Los Angeles.
“They had a similar campaign to this where it was postcards that you can send to senators,” Smith said. “But our biggest worry with that was that the Women’s March is associated with a left movement and a liberal movement when we are very neutral. So something we wanted to do is provide a blank slate for people to just write how they feel and have the resource to look up their representative and find a way to get in contact with them.”
Smith said that the main purpose of Delta Phi Epsilon, which was brought back last semester after a 40-year hiatus, is to serve as a resource especially to students of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
“We restarted the organization in order to have a group of people to talk about what’s going on in our political climate in a professional, organized way and also to develop skills for the workplace,” Smith said. “We hold a lot of events for Dornsife students, specifically those who are interested in international relations, journalism, political science, economics and business. We hold organizational events that are in regards to professional development and talk about what’s going on in political climates at home and abroad.”

Donald Kinder, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, compared the 2008 and 2012 U.S. Presidential Elections at the Department of Political Science’s event Wednesday morning in the Von KleinSmid Center. Kinder highlighted race as the primary driving force of former president Barack Obama’s election in 2008 and reelection in 2012.
Kinder emphasized five indicators of the weight of race in the elections: racial divide in vote, race and turnout, prejudice and white vote, racial solidarity and black vote and racial polarization of the party system.
According to Kinder, the 2008 elections generated a racial divide in America as Obama received 95 percent of the African American votes and 44 percent of the white votes. Kinder mentioned that it was expected that the racial divide in 2012 elections might narrow compared to the 2008 elections, but it didn’t happen.
“Some blacks might have decided that Obama was not the president they had hoped for,” Kinder said. “Some whites might have come to the conclusion that Obama was not the radical race man they had feared. Evidently not. The difference here [2012] is within a hair of the difference in 2008.”
Black voter turnout in 2012 was lower than in 2008, as was the white vote, Kinder added.
Prejudice in the white vote played an important role in 2008 elections, according to various researchers.
“Obama paid a political price for his racial identity in 2008 among whites,” Kinder said. “He lost [the] support of racially conservative and racially resentful white voters that a typical white democratic candidate would have expected to win.”
According to Kinder, researchers predicted that race would play a smaller role in election results in 2012 compared to 2008. Kinder also concluded that Obama’s rise to presidency had no impact at all on racial prejudice.
Kinder observed that there was no evidence that racial group solidarity diminished from 2008 to 2012. Kinder also mentioned that racial group solidarity caused a major number of African Americans to vote for Obama in both the elections.
Skylar Freels, a sophomore majoring in political science and philosophy, felt that racial prejudice is still a major factor in politics.
“I learned kind of unfortunately that racial prejudice is still definitely a massive influence in politics,” Freels said. “The 2012 election was the most polarized around race that we have ever seen. So that’s bad.”
Kinder noted that given recent events, race will continue to play a role in politics.
“Race and politics seem as entangled as ever and going forward, that seems to be the likely case for some time to come,” Kinder said.
Correction: The headline for this article previously stated that Donald Kinder was a USC professor. He is a professor from the University of Michigan. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Next step forward · Cornerback Adoree’ Jackson will look to impress NFL scouts at the combine, which starts on Feb. 28 and runs through March 6. Jackson will be joined in Indianapolis by seven other Trojans – Brian Chin | Daily Trojan
Eight former Trojans will join the best of the best in Indianapolis in two weeks for the NFL Scouting Combine. A total of 330 athletes who declared for the NFL Draft following the completion of the 2016 season will attend the week-long event, which tracks the physical talent of the prospects.
Offensive tackle Zach Banner, running back Justin Davis, cornerback Adoree’ Jackson, guard Damien Mama, wide receivers Darreus Rogers and JuJu Smith-Schuster, nose tackle Stevie Tu’ikolovatu and center Chad Wheeler will represent USC in
on-field exercises.
After three days of examinations and interviews with teams, Banner, Wheeler, Mama and Davis will take the field on March 3 in offensive line and running back on-field workouts. Jackson might also be selected to work out on this day to gauge his abilities on special teams.
Smith-Schuster and Rogers will take the field the next day to compete against an array of
top-ranked wide receiver prospects, including Clemson’s Mike Williams. Tu’ikolovatu will be the sole Trojan working out in Sunday’s defensive line sessions. At 26, Tu’ikolovatu will also be one of the oldest athletes participating in the combine. Finally, Jackson will take the field with the defensive backs’ group.
Jackson is the highest-ranked Trojan, followed closely by Smith-Schuster and Banner. However, the entire group is ranked very closely: At the top, Jackson was given a 5.9 entering the combine, while Davis earned the lowest rank of the group at 5.1. Those numbers still have the possibility of changing over the combine week depending upon each player’s result in the tests and on-field workouts.
The combine is an important factor in any prospect’s draft value, showcasing both raw physical ability and position-based skills. An athlete’s performance in the 40-yard dash, the vertical jump, the bench press or position-specific drills can make the difference between a first-round or second-round draft pick.
The Trojans have produced 496 draft picks, more than any other football program in the country, with 79 of those picks going in the first round. At least one Trojan has been drafted every year since 1939. After the combine, it will only be a waiting game until April 27, when the Cleveland Browns will kick off this year’s draft and begin shaping the next year of the NFL.

Locked in · Sophomore infielder Dillon Paulson will look to build on a strong freshman campaign in which he appeared in 40 of USC’s 56 games – Tal Volk | Daily Trojan
As the USC baseball team winds up for the new season starting this Friday against Coppin State, excitement and uncertainty is brewing in the air.
“Opening day is always special because it’s the start of a new season,” senior outfielder Corey Dempster said. “Everything resets, a new lineup, everything is new. You can’t compare it to last year, you can’t look forward to next year, all that matters is opening day.”
The Trojans lost 12 players from last year’s team in a record-breaking MLB Draft for USC. Former stars such as David Oppenheim and Jeremy Martinez, who provided excellent hitting and power, will need to be replaced with younger, more inexperienced bats. With a completely transformed lineup and pitching rotation that will likely evolve from game to game, freshman players will need to take on important roles.
“They’re going to have to come off the bench to do well,” Dempster said. “They’re not going to think they have a big impact, but later in the season it always rolls around to them.
“Definitely on the mound because our staff is so young, they’re going to have to step up in big spots. Get zeros, compete — that’s really all it’s about. Just go out there and give us a chance to win.”
Despite a very young and reshaped roster, USC does have some familiar faces on this year’s squad. In addition to Dempster, who batted .290 last year with 10 stolen bases, redshirt junior infielder Frankie Rios (.323 batting average) and junior infielder Adalberto Carrillo (seven home runs) return to strengthen the top of the order. In terms of pitching, only junior Mitch Hart and sophomore Marrick Crouse started more than two games last season, but the bullpen will be aided by the arrival of Brock Larson, a senior transfer from University of San Francisco who pitched to a 4.28 ERA last season.
“On the mound, I think whether it’s Mitch Hart or Brad Wegman or Marrick Crouse, we’re going to need those guys to really step up and be significant weekend starters in our league,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “[And] you look at Adalberto Carrillo at third: He’s a plus defender at third and he has big, big power.”
Last season, the Trojans finished an even 28-28 overall and 15-15 in conference play. This year, the team aims to find more consistency on its journey to once again become a national powerhouse.
“We’ve started to put ’SC baseball back on the map, but I think this group is ready to make its mark,” Hubbs said. “They practice hard, they play hard and they’re going to play with a lot of energy and passion. I think it’ll be fun for students and fans to watch us play this year.”
The team’s path begins Friday against the Coppin State Eagles, a Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference team based in Baltimore. Last season, the Eagles finished 14-38, and they are four years removed from a 1-52 season. But regardless of the opposing team’s pedigree, the Trojans know that opening day will be special.
“Just the fact that we’re getting back out onto the field,” Hubbs said. “I think that if you’re a Trojan fan, these kids will give you a lot to be proud of, and you’ll like the way we play. The style of play — it’s going to be exciting. It’s always fun when you get the opportunity to see a bunch of new guys out there.”
USC kicks off its season on Friday, playing the first of a three-game set against the Eagles at Dedeaux Field. First pitch is scheduled for 6 p.m., and the series will wrap up with two weekend matinees, beginning at 2 p.m. on Saturday and 1 p.m. on Sunday.
It was a sad state of affairs that with all the talent last year the team was only .500. This year’s club is picked for 2nd to last in the conference in one poll so nowhere to go , but upwards. Realistically the program has accomplished very little under Coach Hubbs  on the national scene.

Last Friday, Eric He penned a column in the Daily Trojan about sportswriters and athletes being told to “stick to sports” in today’s tumultuous political climate.
“Yes, athletes are committed to sports, as are those who write about them,” he wrote. “But we can — and should — treat ourselves and, likewise, be treated as so much more. Never just ‘stick to sports.’ Please, never do.”
Given that He is the associate managing editor of the Daily Trojan (and my boss), I don’t want to step on his toes too much … but he’s wrong. I’m not an advocate of some codified separation of sport and state, and I certainly don’t believe players and writers should be barred from voicing their political opinions. Having said that, I also believe sports are at their most effective — and affective — when their crossover with the so-called “real world” is kept to a minimum.
I remember the moment when sports impacted my life the most: It was a regular season NHL game between the Buffalo Sabres and Boston Bruins on April 17, 2013. I don’t remember too much of what transpired on the ice — only that Boston lost and not a soul in New England cared.
I do remember the pregame ceremonies, though, as a shell-shocked region filed into the TD Garden and tuned in on TV to watch the first local sporting event following the Boston Marathon bombing. The manhunt for the terrorists responsible was still ongoing, and people were overwhelmed by fear, grief and utter bewilderment. An overly emotional Rene Rancourt was unable to belt out his usual rendition of “The Star Spangled Banner” in the arena, so the crowd helped him. A 20,000 person choir performed the national anthem that night, ending with defiant chants of “USA! USA!”
Then we wiped away our tears and forgot about it all for a few hours while watching men crash into each other at high speeds on ice.
To me, this is sports at their best. Because as hard as we all rep our favorite teams or poke fun at the Warriors blowing a 3-1 lead, sports unite people. Even before that night in the Garden, teams around Major League Baseball had begun playing Neil Diamond’s “Sweet Caroline,” the Boston Red Sox’s seventh inning stretch anthem, at their games to show support for the city. The team that came up with the idea to do that? The New York Yankees. Signs littered Yankee Stadium: “YANKEE FANS LOVE BOSTON.”
When I look back on how much sports helped heal New England in 2013 (the Red Sox won the World Series, and the Bruins made a run to the Stanley Cup Final), it’s easy to forget how politically charged the Marathon bombing was. The fallout from the terrorist attack predictably included more fear mongering about the Islamic State, and Rolling Stone angered millions by plastering the murderer on its front cover. Some wanted the bomber burned at the stake; others thought he was a sympathetic victim of radical propaganda. Sports provided a distraction from the anger. I was already a Yankee fan before arriving in New England, but I’ll admit it was sweet to see the Red Sox celebrate their championship with “B STRONG” emblazoned the outfield grass behind them. Boston felt strong indeed.
Things feel different now in the Trump era. If that Bruins’ pregame ceremony took place today, would a player sit on the bench during the anthem in protest? If President Donald Trump threw out a first pitch — like President George W. Bush did post-9/11 during the 2001 World Series — would he be booed? Would players or coaches speak out against Trump’s presence? Unlike sports, politics are inherently divisive, and the deeper divisions Trump brings are threatening to hang over sporting events as a four-year shadow.
This is what I’m afraid of: not that athletes, coaches and sportswriters aren’t “staying in their lane” by speaking out politically, but that their trend will soon turn sporting figures into political figures, too. Such a trend would rob sports of what I cherish most about them. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has inextricably linked himself to the anti-national anthem crusade, and no matter where he plays next season, that will follow him. All of a sudden, rooting for Kaepernick’s team unavoidably aligns you with his movement to some degree, which is fine with some, but not with others. The same goes for Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr and his many passionate objections to Trump and his policies. In other words, sports are slowly becoming a springboard into political arguments — and that’s my nightmare.
Of course, without politics mixing with sports, Jackie Robinson may have never broken the color barrier in Major League Baseball. You might even say that the sports world’s response to the Boston Marathon bombing was a type of political stance. So I’m not going to sit here and join the chants of “stick to sports.” But the rare occasions in which sports crossed into politics are now becoming far too common, and instead of healing and bringing people together, sports are now drawing fresh dividing lines.
Whether it comes to athletes, coaches or sportswriters like myself, let’s be careful. We should never be afraid to speak out about what we care about, but we also shouldn’t equate that boldness with an invitation to play Chuck Todd. We all hear enough every single day about how the world is burning to the ground. Tuning into a ballgame is our amazing escape from all that. Let’s keep that in mind and keep sports great.
Oliver Jung is a junior studying print and digital journalism. He is also the sports editor of the Daily Trojan. His column, Jung Money, runs on Thursdays.
Agreed.  I too really wish athletes would focus on the sportsball more.  I got really mad when Colin Kaepernick started talking a lot about the politics.  I think he should be allowed to talk about non-sportsball things, but only if it doesn’t overly stimulate my brain since all society’s problems are solved.  Please Colin, just work on throwing the footballs from now on you are supposed to be my sportsman not a politic boy lol.

The NCAA Innovations in Research Grant and Practice Grant Program awarded USC Athletics a $25,000 grant on Wednesday. The funding will be used toward the development and evaluation of a mindfulness training program aimed at improving the mental health of the vibrant student-athlete population at USC.
The Trojans are one of five research teams in the country who received a grant from the NCAA this year. The grants are funded through a program that supports projects aimed at improving the mental health of college athletes.
The proposal was selected from a group of 63 projects by a panel of athletics administrators, mental health practitioners, student-athletes and scholars from all three divisions of the NCAA.  Overall, a total of $100,000 was awarded this year.
The program is in its fourth year, helping to support work that tackles issues of career development and mental health in student-athletes. The USC team will head to the 2018 NCAA Convention in Indianapolis in January to present their findings, along with the other winning teams from Rowan University, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Western Kentucky University
and Sonoma State University.
The Trojans’ grant proposal was written by Dr. Robin Scholefield and Dr. Dylan Firsick, two psychologists at the Engemann Student Health Center. The proposal cited the fact that many student-athletes are reporting a rise in the “severity and number of mental health symptoms.”
These symptoms include anxiety over demands on their time and performance, along with increased risk factors for both psychological and academic struggles.
Now that it is funded, the study will use a five-session mindfulness training program to attempt to reduce the anxiety and increase the well-being of student-athletes. If successful, this program will then be implemented in all NCAA sports programs.

re:, a show featuring original artwork from eight students experimenting in the mold-making process, is the newest display in the Roski School of Art and Design.  Each piece copied the original design in a unique way, presenting work ranging from excessively functional sculptures to somber artistic statements about society.
The eight featured artists all created their pieces for the Fall 2016 course “Modeling and Mold Making,” taught by Professor Julie Schustack. The course itself introduced students to plaster mold making for various sculpture materials, including ceramics, styrofoam and bronze.
Each art piece in the exhibit features multiple copies of an original art piece with slight variations. Some pieces featured two similar pieces, while others included dozens of models created from their original mold.
Many of the art pieces delved into deeper themes related to mimicry, copying and molds. Consumerism and industrialization especially lend themselves to artwork in re:.
“My focus was really on American society and the consumer culture that infects it,” said Cameron Dehn, a junior majoring in fine arts.
He created two pieces featured in re: called “Three Headed Spoon” and “Swiffer Lamp.” The first piece shows a cross with three spoon heads while the second features three lamps that end in a ceramic swiffer mop.
Though the two creations use different materials and creative styles, they speak to a similar theme. Dehn felt that the idea of consumerism guided his two projects in an absurd, satirical direction.
“I was creating objects that make things more convenient, like with the ‘Three Headed Spoon,’” Dehn said. “But in a sense, it’s not convenient anymore.”
Sharif Farrag, a senior majoring in fine arts, also felt compelled by the concept of mold making.
“I wanted to be able to make replicas or serial objects, stuff I could make a mold of and crank out a bunch, like 10 or 20 of them … It becomes this process, and I really like that,” Farrag said. “And it’s this industrial thing — they use molds in making toothbrushes, making deodorant sticks. That’s a part of my work that I’m interested in, so I thought the class fit into it pretty nicely.”
Rather than having students curate the exhibit, Schustack initiated the exhibit’s application process.
“She did it all herself — she just applied. She didn’t even tell us or any of the class,” Farrag said. “She told me three weeks ago … I think we had a good group of students, and I feel like everyone was pushing themselves to make something substantial, so I think that’s why she wanted to showcase what happened in that class.”
Following the opening of the exhibit, Dehn reflected on how the experimentation conducted in the mold making class impacted his current artwork.
“Last semester, I was focused on looking at American and consumer culture in a negative light and a satirical way because I don’t agree with the way it exists,” Dehn said. “Now I’m more focused on promoting the earth and promoting positive things that I’m interested in rather than focusing on more satirical things.”
Farrag was also impacted by his work with Schustack and hopes that seeing his artwork and the exhibit will inspire viewers to be creatively active, choosing to create instead of acting as consumers in their daily lives.
Re: will be on display in the Helen Lindhurst Fine Arts Gallery from Feb. 13 to Feb. 23. The gallery is open from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays, but it will host an opening reception for the exhibit from 5 to 7 p.m on Thursday. The exhibit is free and open to the public.

On Valentine’s Day evening, the crowd at Drago Ristorante surprisingly filled up only three quarters of the restaurant. However, despite not having a full house, the service at Drago Ristorante was slow at best.
Nestled in the Petersen Automotive Museum, Drago Ristorante is the newest Italian restaurant to open on Museum Row. The design of the restaurant itself is sleek and modern — falling in line with the general aesthetic of the Petersen Automotive Museum.
Clean lines and monochrome colors offset by colorful walls give the restaurant an elegant feeling and look. The restaurant feels open and larger than the space actually is as an open bar faces a  kitchen, while in between are perfectly spaced out seating.
Upon entry, the hostess was not present to greet patrons. As a result, it took a while before someone got seated. After being seated, it took at least another 20 to 25 minutes before a server could bring water or bread to the table. Afterward, it took another 15 to 20 minutes for the server to come back to take an order.
The restaurant offers a variety of Italian dishes commonly seen in Drago restaurants: pastas, pizzas, appetizers (antipasti) and entrees such as veal with truffle mashed potatoes. In comparison to other Drago restaurants, Drago Ristorante offers food under a similar price range. Dishes typically range from $11 to $28, and the other entrees could be anything above $25 to below $50.
The food is typically what people will find in many of the upscale, less traditional Italian restaurants throughout Los Angeles. Though the ingredients used were high quality, the dishes were not unique to the restaurant.
The waiting time between appetizers to entrees was long. However, the appetizer list does offer a unique twist at some points. In replacement of the typical bread that is usually served on a charcuterie board, there were square, fried bread pieces that are made fresh to order. These pieces were savory and a mixture of both crunchy and soft that complemented the cold cuts.
The main entree that stood out was the veal with truffle mashed potatoes. However, it was not the piece of steak itself, but rather the truffle mashed potatoes that was truly extraordinary. Unlike other restaurants, the mashed potatoes at Drago Ristorante were as smooth as a puree and infused with a heavy dose of truffle oil and truffle pieces that made the dish savory and fragrant.
Despite the quality of Drago Ristorante’s food, the restaurant wasn’t necessarily special — not for the price tags of the menu offerings nor the slow, unsatisfying service. The Drago brothers should focus less on the aesthetic of the restaurant and start improving the service they provide to their patrons.

Chief inspirational officer · Annabel Nava graduated from the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism in 1996. Now, she serves as a motivational speaker and mentor to help others find their purpose – Amrin Khurana | Daily Trojan
Annabel Nava did not realize her life’s purpose until she experienced the loss of her father. Now, Nava serves as a mentor for students who are eager to find a fulfilling career.
Though she has today nurtured her career in broadcast journalism for years, in retrospect, Nava was unaware of the sudden turn her life took. When she applied to USC as an undergraduate, Nava dreamed of entering the film industry, but she cautiously decided to choose a more stable career path by pursuing a degree in communication.
“I can pretty much do anything I want, but I still loved television broadcast,” Nava said. “People across the nation are looking at my work … It was very rewarding for me to be able to do that.”
Since she was already exposed to television production in high school, Nava felt she should pursue what she already knew how to do.
Nava graduated from USC with her bachelor’s degree in communication arts and sciences in 1996. After entering the professional world, she worked her way up from an assistant position to writer to producer for end credits of shows at Fox Broadcasting Company. In three years, Nava changed her mindset from “at least I’m in the industry I want to be in” to “I’m getting to where I need to be.”
During that period of time, Nava’s personal life and career path appeared stable. She was happy with her marriage and her children and was developing a balance between her professional growth and family life — until disaster struck. Nava’s greatest source of support, her father, was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer.
This moment inspired Nava to concentrate on present moments, on aspects that mattered in real life  — not on a television screen. She left her position as operations manager at Fox, and Nava knew she needed to be the strong and supportive soldier to defend her father’s faith in life.
“It all happens for a reason,” Nava said.
She didn’t feel an internal struggle after she quit her high position of overseeing the production process at Fox. In the National Latina Business Women Association,  Nava found support in receiving the necessary skills to help her husband with his construction business. Through those moments, Nava realized she could combine her passion for empowerment with a mission to support family.  As a board member for the organization, Nava now serves as an inspirational speaker, and hopes to impact the lives of Latina women in their self-development.
Charged by her change in life perspective, Nava made her way back to Fox, adding soul to production management as a connector between creative departments and executives. She has been through personal struggles, but those experiences allow Nava to help others balance their emotions and perceptions within the workspace.
She now coaches diverse groups of people and nurtures her gift to impact those in her audience.
“It feels like I’m a messenger,” Nava said. “Everything starts feeling easy and natural. You know you’re in the right place.”
She acknowledged that her job requires soft skills and strong interpersonal communication, strengths she obtained while studying at USC.
“Sometimes when I have conversations with people, I get so in the zone that I don’t even know where the words come from,” Nava said, about  hosting workshops with her favorite audience — students.
When asked to share her wisdom with those just beginning to form their life goals, she addressed students’ common desire to perceive others’ criticism as a personal attack.
“Don’t take things personally,” Nava said.
Nava learned that the real challenge is setting limits while being fully committed to work and being sensitive to others’ feedback.
“Know that if you step away, they’re going to survive without you,” Nava said.

It took a long time for Geetha Somayajula to set her sights on being a music major. She’s always enjoyed singing in choirs and playing the piano, but she never saw it as a viable career path.
But two things helped her. Now, as a junior majoring in choral music and business administration, she’s found her way.
The first was a transformative experience during high school. She brought a ticket stub to our interview.
“The first time I saw Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony when was I was 16,” Somayajula said. “I saw it with the San Francisco Symphony with Michael Tilson Thomas performing — I love him. That was the moment I thought I was going to do music as a minor, and I didn’t know the extent to which I wanted to do it.”
But she still had one problem — convincing her parents that she really wanted to pursue a degree in choral and sacred music.
“My Hindu parents were quite shocked that I picked that for a degree,” Somayajula said.
However, Somayajula won them over by drawing an analogy between Western classical music and south Indian classical sacred music.
“I was born into a very traditional south Indian family. My mom loves classical Carnatic south Indian music,” Somayajula said. “My grandfather was a lecturer on classical south Indian Carnatic music — back in rural India he was a college professor, so I think in our family, high art was something that my parents really enjoyed.”
It’s her grounding in Carnatic tradition that has helped her excel as a singer of Western classical music. Somayajula told me that she has always felt a strong correspondence between her training in Western and south Indian classical music. It’s in the world of pop music that she said took some time to find her niche.
“From the day I was born, [my mom] was taking me to Carnatic music concerts,” Somayajula said. “So I think I was very accustomed to sit upright in a concert [and] clap when you’re supposed to. So I never felt like it was unnatural for me. But it’s tough though, when you’re growing up and everyone knows the Beatles and Michael Jackson and stuff. I never had cultural context for that, so that music came later for me.”
But that also meant that when she started listening to pop music, it was with an attentive ear. Because of her second major, Somayajula is now interested in learning more about pop music’s ubiquitous presence in culture.
Somayajula’s double major sometimes divides her sympathies between the practical impulse to balance the ledger and her artistic reverence for music — especially classical music, which has been on uncertain financial footing lately.
“As a business major, do you ever listen to music thinking, who’s going to buy this?” I asked.
“It makes you kind of sad actually, when you are a business major and you go to the LA Chamber Orchestra,” Somayajula said. “I’m very cognizant of how revenues are paying out. And the advancement of classical music — that’s really important to me.”
But Somayajula remains aware that this kind of bottom-line thinking puts many music purists off. She hopes musicians can let go of some of the stodgiest strictures of performance practice to welcome new listeners into the fold, while still maintaining a reverent atmosphere that puts the focus on the music.
“You have to strike the right balance,” Somayajula said. “There’s like, an old school and a new school. In order to make this music accessible — because it is — I think it’s just the way that we market it and portray it that alienates people.”
Somayajula offered a few examples of local groups that she things are hitting this balance on the nose.
“I’m really inspired by Kaleidoscope and Wild Up, and the exciting initiatives they’re doing at the Phil,” Somayajulia said. “The LA Master Chorale is doing more pops concerts. These are good things because this music is important. It’s the education, I think, that we are lacking.”
“Education” means both for musicians to learn more about streamlining their operations and marketing effectively and for the general public to have a deeper understanding of classical music and high art from a young age, as she elaborated. That made me curious about her career goals going forward, and she offered two compellingly different answers.
Somayajula is considering delving deeper into Carnatic music. She recommended one work to give me a sense of how challenging south Indian music can be: a set of five pieces called the “Pancharatna Krithis” by the composer Thyagaraja. Geetha’s favorite is the last from that set.
“It’s called ‘Endaro Mahanubhavulu’ and it’s about the great saints of music … Even though [Thyagaraja] was like the greatest composer of all time, he was also a very religious and humble man. When I hear that music, it makes me feel grateful for all the fantastic Indian and Western music education that I’ve had. And it’s just a fantastic piece too,” Somayajula said.
Though she’s heard the piece since a young age — it’s also a favorite of her mother’s — Geetha has never been able to perform it.
“In my Carnatic music study, I still have a long way to go to be that technically adept,” she said. “Once I graduate, I’d really like to get a master’s degree in choral music. I’d really like to continue to work on crossing over — things from other cultures.”
In India, rather than study at a university or conservatory, she would seek a tutor to take her on as a protege. But Geetha’s immediate goals have her looking another direction: She wants to join an a cappella group like the one she had in high school.
“It’s like an alter ego that I kind of miss sometimes,” she said. “I’m not in a cappella here, but I think next year I might. I think my voice is growing stronger and as I grow as a singer I’m more able to adapt to different vocal styles. It’s something that’s hard to do when you’re growing in one vocal style.”
For now, Geetha continues to be deeply invested in her study of the Western canon. Rather than keep her from enjoying other styles of music, her classical study deepens her understanding of her own voice — and her artistic person.
Wherever music takes her next, I am inspired by her reverence for music. It means she can sing in a way that’s truly inspired — once the books are balanced, anyway.

Held during the peak of Los Angeles rush hour, Music@RushHour encourages students and faculty to come by and enjoy the live performances of students at the USC Thornton School of Music.
Wednesday’s Music@RushHour featured students of Grammy-award winning guitarists William Kanengiser and Scott Tennant. Music@RushHour featured compositions from a variety of places and musical genres, including Italian romantic melodies and Hungarian dances.
The hour began with Aaron Haas, a classical guitar graduate student, and Elissa Brown, a junior studying flute, playing Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco’s Sonatina Op. 205, a neo-classical, romantic duet.
The first movement, Allegretto grazioso, fluttered throughout the room, as the guitar and flute echoing each other softly.
Meanwhile, Tempo di Siciliana: Andantino grazioso e malinconico slowed down the pace of the composition, becoming a melancholic love story filled with longing. Scherzo – Rondo: Allegretto con spirit lifted the audience’s spirits as Haas’ guitar and Brown’s flute chased one another through the highs and lows of the movement, ending the composition in a whirlwind of sound.
The next act, featuring David Steinhardt, a classical guitar graduate student, and Annie Jacobs-Perkins, a junior studying cello, contrasted the styles of Austrian composer Franz Schubert and modern, Welsh composer Stephen Goss while showcasing the creativity of Tedesco once again. The performance of Goss’ Park of Idols, transitioned from fast-paced staccato to smooth jazz and finally ending with passionate, intense rock.
Haas’ performance of Tonadilla sur le nom de Andrés Segovia, Op. 170, intertwined two distinct themes that spelled the name of the eponymous guitarist throughout the piece.
The last performance by the “Bokyung Quartet,” comprised of Bokyung Byun, Tomasz Fechner, Daniel Marx and Jaxon Williams contrasted the impressionism of Cuban composer Leo Brouwer and Hungarian composer Franz Liszt’s romantic, folk dance melody. Cuban Landscape in the Rain started with a melody of soft rain, then ascended to discordant and loud heights of a storm and ended  with the gentle pattern of a drizzle, mirroring the cycle of nature.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Fantasy No. 2 danced between tempos, going from exciting loud beats to gentle, drawn notes and finally leading into its all-too-familiar folk theme. With the ending of Hungarian Fantasy No. 2, Music@RushHour also came to a close. However, the tunes of the classical guitarists will continue to echo through the audience’s minds.
Music@RushHour returns next week with a focus on piano performance.

Katlyn Lee | Daily Trojan
For as long as anyone can remember, the corner room on the fourth floor of the Student Union has belonged to the Daily Trojan.
Mona Cravens, USC’s director of student publications, has worked here for 40 years and says the newsroom has always been here, exactly as it is now. The editor-in-chief’s office, where so many decisions have been made and long nights have been spent, has stood there ever since a fourth floor was added to the building in the 1940s. And the balcony that overlooks Tommy Trojan and has an unreasonably spectacular view of Downtown has witnessed the comings and goings of presidents, provosts and faculty members alike — and was even the site of at least one marriage proposal.
Steeped in history as it is, it’s no wonder that the layout of the newsroom itself seems unchangeable. There’s the table for the managing editors in the center, impenetrable as an island fortress; the news desk off to the side, clearly indicating that the city editor is too busy with layout to socialize; the red couch facing the TV, ready to watch the latest presidential address or sports event; and the copy corner, walled off from the rest of the room by a plexiglas screen that may as well be a concrete barrier.
At least, this is how it seemed to me for many of the first weeks I spent in this room. As a freshman, I would come in to the office, too intimidated to talk to the managing editors working busily on pages at the center table and too shy to make conversation with the lifestyle or sports editors sequestered in the back rooms of the office. Everyone had their place, and everyone stuck to it – and this seemed efficient to me, but also rather lonely.
I’ve been an editor for almost three semesters now, and I’ve certainly experienced times when this rigidity is real and not just a figment of my over-analytical imagination. I’ve seen it on the faces of freshmen who, much like my past self, are afraid to break what seems to be a deeply ingrained balance by coming up to the managing table or moving around the room and talking to different editors and staffers. At times it’s worked out OK — and at others, it’s hindered the development of deep relationships between editors and writers and even restricted the flow of ideas from one editor to another.
But this semester, something is different. When I enter the newsroom now, I see not only editors hard at work on their individual pages and articles, but also writers, photographers, designers and copy editors who come in to mingle with other members of the staff and end up staying far longer than they ever need to. I’ve seen editors move into the main office to do their work in a more open environment where they can more easily collaborate, and sit at the managing table with ease, knowing that nothing keeps them from doing so.
What changed? The way I see it, a tightly-knit team of editors — the most closely bonded I’ve experienced during my time here — makes all the difference because these editors are more comfortable with each other, and in turn, pass on that feeling of easy collaboration to their staffers. Breaking down emotional barriers leads people to want to remove physical ones too — and that means working more closely together in one area instead of feeling isolated simply because of one’s position.
The physical space that the newsroom occupies has an enormous impact on the people that work there and the overall quality of the paper, in a much larger way than most people realize. It’s not just about being able to tap someone on the shoulder and ask them a question, but about feeling like we’re all part of one team, instead of individual units working on individual sections. The newsroom, in all of its 70-plus year history, may not have been designed to evoke this kind of intersectional collaboration — but maybe, after all this time, it’s time to create a new tradition.

On Monday, actress and model Emily Ratajkowski took to Twitter to defend First Lady Melania Trump after a New York Times journalist allegedly called Trump a “hooker” off the record.
“Whatever your politics, it’s crucial to call this out for what it is: slut-shaming,” Ratajkowski tweeted. “I don’t care about her nudes or sexual history. Gender specific attacks are … sexist bullsh-t.”
Ratajkowski, a vocal feminist and victim of endless gender-based attacks herself, raises a crucial point that was often throughout the campaign trail by supporters and opponents of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton alike: Whether or not you agree with an individual, attacks on the basis of identity are never appropriate. They serve as attacks on whole communities of people rather than one single individual. In this sense, weaponizing female sexuality to degrade the first lady isn’t an attack on her, but on all women.
In the same vein, despite how conservative commentator Ann Coulter has literally called for reversal on women’s suffrage and is open about her disdain for Mexican immigrants, African Americans and essentially all marginalized groups, calling her a “b-tch” or “c-nt” — as some of her liberal critics often do — only serves to stoop to Coulter’s level and steal attention from legitimate criticism of her backwards and offensive stances.
This doesn’t exclusively relate to gender: For example, throughout the 2016 primaries, I wondered why New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was being dragged by progressives for his weight and appearance, when it would be exponentially more productive to criticize his problematic policies.
That being said, Melania Trump’s gender hardly excuses her from valid criticisms, such as her refusal to recognize and advocate for the many women who lack her privilege. This is a deeply pervasive issue worth considering in an America where 53 percent of white women voted into the presidency a man who has attacked with his rhetoric and policies virtually every marginalized community.
Sexism isn’t just overt, self-avowed hatred of women, and sexism isn’t exclusively perpetuated by men. As the women of President Donald Trump’s administration — from his wife, who seems to turn a blind eye to Trump’s bigotry so she can continue to enjoy vast economic privilege, to adviser Kellyanne Conway, who tells blatant lies to defend the president’s attacks on people who lack her privilege — demonstrate so clearly, sexism is also perpetuated by women who throw poor women, LGBTQ women and women of color under the bus to advance their own narrow interests.
An individual’s gender, race or sexual orientation doesn’t excuse complicity in attacks on those who lack their privilege. At a time when one’s right to exist in this country is being increasingly challenged on the basis of nationality and religion, when one’s access to bodily autonomy is becoming increasingly contingent on economic status, those who fail to utilize their privilege to help those who lack it can no longer be held above criticism — whatever their gender.
As Conway deflects valid criticisms (after breaking the law by promoting Ivanka Trump’s business) by portraying these criticisms as sexist, and Ivanka Trump identifies as a feminist while offering deafening silence on her father’s stances on poor women, immigrant women facing deportation, indigenous women disproportionately harmed by climate change and, of course, women seeking healthcare and reproductive rights, it is crucial that media call out this underhandedness. To criticize a woman is not inherently sexist. That being said, being a woman can render one more susceptible to petty, seemingly gender-neutral derision.
At the end of the day, the list of Melania Trump’s acts entirely unrelated to her sultry past as a model that warrant criticism is endless. On top of doing nothing with her privilege to help those being persecuted by her husband’s administration and refusing to educate herself, Melania Trump is also costing Americans millions in tax dollars every day to live in New York while refusing to do her technical job as first lady and oversee White House tours.
Anyone who takes issue with  Trump’s nude photos and allegations that she was once an escort — none of which hurt marginalized people — but not the aforementioned behaviors ought to reevaluate their priorities.  To equate the “sin” of revealing photos and allegations of sex work with the actual sin of condoning bigotry is pure sexism.
When former First Lady Michelle Obama said, “When they go low, we go high,” she didn’t mean that people in positions of power, regardless of any facet of their identity, should not be held accountable. She didn’t mean that we should hold our tongues and never say a word against bullies, oppressors and those complicit in bullying and oppression. It seems more likely she meant our criticisms of them must be identity-neutral, that to “go high” ought to include fostering a climate in which those with privilege are encouraged to advocate on behalf of those who lack it and those who do not are called out for their harmful silence and apathy.

On Feb. 7, leading Republican donor Betsy DeVos was confirmed by the Senate as the U.S. secretary of education. After a contentious confirmation period and a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence, DeVos was appointed to the position despite weeks of protests from Democrats and two Republican defections from confirmation. And as a wealthy Republican donor with no substantive experience in public schooling, she should be questioned.
Now that DeVos is officially in charge of public education, teachers and administrators throughout the nation are voicing their disdain for her views, especially on charter schools and voucher programs at the K-12 level. At public colleges, students are worried about DeVos’ Republican politics resulting in budget cuts and tuition hikes. At a private college like USC, students may think that they are generally safe from policy changes from the Department of Education. Though private university students are more insulated from federal education policy than those at public schools, DeVos has demonstrated worrying stances on sexual assault and other hot-button campus issues that can still affect USC students.
When Senator Bob Casey asked DeVos if she would uphold the Obama administration’s guidelines around campus sexual assault in her confirmation hearings, DeVos dodged the question.
“If confirmed, I would look forward to working with you and your colleagues and understand the range of opinions and understand the issues from the higher ed institutions that are charged with resolving these,” DeVos said. It’s a characteristically weak stance that showed that perhaps she wasn’t ready for the question, which is surprising because campus sexual assault is one of the most visible education issues in the nation.
As the national head of the public education system, DeVos could reverse the reforms that former President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden put in place to make campuses safer for sexual assault survivors. Under the former administration, the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights released a famous 2011 letter entitled “Dear Colleague,” which advised higher education officials to make changes in their treatment of sexual assault cases. These changes included considering sexual assault as a form of sexual harassment that violated Title IX and using a lower standard of evidence in sexual assault cases than that required in criminal cases. This acknowledged the difficult nature of collecting evidence for sexual assault cases, which can leave survivors traumatized and too afraid of shame and blame to come forward at all.
OCR’s actions, combined with the creation of a special White House task force on sexual assault and the vice president’s “It’s On Us” campaign, established the Obama White House as a strong fighter for victim’s rights.
Under DeVos, the education department could lose this reputation, or even proceed in the opposite direction. Though the secretary didn’t assert a stance on the issue, her donations tell another story. Between 2012 and 2013, DeVos and her husband donated a total of $10,000 to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. FIRE is dedicated to defending the individual rights of students and professors, but also advocates for the right of those accused of sexual assault. At one point in the Obama administration, FIRE sued to raise the standard of proof for victims and increase the role of law enforcement in sexual assault cases. Though these objectives are  a small part of the organization’s platform, DeVos’ involvement with FIRE shows that she may pursue the same policies.
Additionally, there is speculation among anti-campus sexual assault advocacy organizations such as End Rape on Campus that DeVos might require colleges to leave cases of sexual assault solely to law enforcement, and it could be within the scope of her authority to do so. Since survivors tend to be intimidated by outside law enforcement, research suggests that this would dramatically lower rates of reporting and thus lower survivors’ chances of receiving justice.
By rolling back the Obama administration changes — which still were not enough to truly address the issue — the nation’s higher education systems will be taking a giant step backward. Tipping the scales further away from victims and moving the responsibility toward law enforcement will only leave students in more danger. The systems that we have on college campuses are not perfect by any means, but the changes made in the last six years have been hugely beneficial to provide support for victims and improve campus culture.
With an administration that has already proven itself to be insensitive to the issue of sexual assault (note the “grab them by the p-ssy” scandal), even private college students cannot sit back and let changes be made. Beyond her complete lack of competence in the job, DeVos could seriously ruin the policies around sexual assault that have changed campus culture for the better.
Permit the accused to have his “day in court” – jurisprudence as practiced in our court system – and you will partially regain credibility.  The fact that the accused on college campuses is presumed guilty followed by unchallenged punishment with no appeal is, in fact, part and partial to fascism.
Paranoia runs rampant via ignorance. What we do know is DeVoy is pro school choice. She wants to improve educational opportunities kids living in poverty and low income families.  The only groups who are against the appointment are the teachers unions because they will lose their power over you. Big government will be reigned in. Under Obamw, the federal government got fat and is overweight. Trump’s administration will put the feds on a diet and bring it back to a healthy state of mind.  
SomInsay, have an open mind and spend your time studying and learning. As it was in the 60 revokution, looking back on it we learned that most of the leadership of that effort were manipulated by the Soviets, paid by the Soviets and other anarchist donors, and it hurt our country for a decade or so.  The same thing is happening now. You and the 30000 active anarchists and the 25000 being trained right now are being manipulated by the “dark governemt” of George Soros and Barack Hussein Obama.  They are working to over throw the Trump Administration,  and like Trump or not, the insurgency you’re witnessing today is going to get much worse before it gets better, and people will be hurt or killed because of it.  This is civil war, and the DeVos issue is just making folks take their eye off the ball.  Folks like you, my kids, all young people for “you do not know what you are doing”. Be careful.  The anarchists really n don’t care ab I UT u ou. They want power of the governemnt and control over you.  We’ve seen this type of anarchy before and it doesn’t work.  Why do you think the Dept of Ed under Obama didn’t teach you kids civics and accurate history?  They want to dumb down the kids.  Conservatives want you to he smart and a contributor to society not a leech.

Department of Public Safety officers responded to reports of a vendor on Trousdale Parkway selling shirts and albums with swastika symbols Wednesday afternoon.
About 50 students gathered in front of the vendor’s booth and demanded for him to leave campus, according to DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle. The vendor had obtained the proper permits to sell at USC and agreed to leave peacefully. There were no fights and no arrests were made, Carlisle said.
“The merchandise the vendor was selling did not meet community standards, per USC guidelines for vendors,” according to a statement from the University sent in an email to the Daily Trojan.

Ilana Spiegel, a junior majoring in communication, first noticed a graphic T-shirt with the words “Friends of the Swastika” along with the symbol on her way to class. Spiegel said she confronted the vendor, Gordon McGinnis, who explained that it was a “reclaiming of the symbol.” According to Spiegel, McGinnis told her to have “tough skin” and said the swastika has deep historical roots in Asian culture.
“I’m very disappointed that this man was allowed to sell this T-shirt and these albums with swastikas on them,” Spiegel said. “I told him, ‘I’m mixed-race Chinese and Jewish,’ but I know there is no way to erase the connotations of evil, destruction and death.”
McGinnis said he curates most of the items carried in his shop. According to McGinnis, the intention of putting out the items was to educate people about the origins of the symbol.
“I didn’t set out to promote racism — my intention was to promote anti-racism,” McGinnis said. “I didn’t mean to offend so many people. As soon as the student said she was offended, I took the T-shirt down. I hate racism. I’m black and white.”
Carlisle said that despite the vendor’s intentions, DPS responded to the scene because its first priority was to keep students safe.
“In a situation like this … we are going to keep the peace, and we want to make sure that any conflicts between students and anyone else on campus are peaceful,” Carlisle said. “It is our job to enforce University policy, [and] in this case no enforcement action was taken. It was cooperation on behalf of both the student and the vendor.”
Claire Hill, a student studying anthropology, defended McGinnis’ business and said she did not see a problem with the shirt being sold because “it’s a free country.”
“It’s really quite disgusting that anyone would go so far out of their way to cause an issue for this man and affect his business based on something that offended them,” Hill said.
Hill also said that differences of opinion should be “celebrated” and “encouraged” on college campuses, adding that any student who felt offended by the shirt could just walk away.
“It’s really depressing that we cannot have equal representation of ideas and beliefs,” Hill said. “I might not agree with what they’re saying, but I will defend to death their right to say it.”
Zach Larkin, a senior majoring in history, said the swastika could not be reclaimed, as it still an emblem of the Neo-Nazi movement in America and Europe. According to Larkin, he and other students will refuse to defend McGinnis’ products.
“I think freedom of speech is incredibly important, if not one of the most fundamental threats to civil liberties under fire right now in our country,” Larkin said. “That’s why we need to have precise conversations to understand what those are. [The incident today] is not that form.”
Henry Levy, the prior of the majority-Jewish fraternity, Sigma Alpha Mu, said that this incident “hit close to home.” He said his great uncle had been in an internment camp during the Holocaust.
“A lot of our members were deeply offended by it,” Levy said. “It’s best to approach the subject with peace, just because the entire goal of eliminating the symbol itself is to create peace among everyone.”
The executive director of USC Hillel, Bailey London, also sent out a memorandum to the members of the organization regarding the incident. The memorandum said that items like the ones being sold “have no place on our campus.”
“These items are anti-Semitic and trivialize the Holocaust, an incredibly dark period in history in which more than 6 million Jews perished,” the memo said.
McGinnis typically sells records and clothing at a booth on Trousdale Parkway. He said that in order to use the space at the University, he had to pay dues and present proof of insurance. McGinnis said he also went through a process to obtain a permit from the University.
“I’m so sorry about this incident,” McGinnis said. “If I had known about the commotion this would cause, I would not have promoted it in the first place.”
Porshad Elie, Alina Abidi and Diana Kruzman contributed to this report.
 
BTW, WE didn’t say WE were reclaiming the swastika, #ManWoman did, you need to take that down or you will be hearing from our legal team.
What nonsense. The man was trying to remind these people the swastika is much more than a Nazi symbol. Visit a vast swath of Asia even today and you will find it all over the place-daubed on temples, houses, stores, vehicles, wedding invitations and what have you as a symbol of good luck. And these countries and religions which revere the Swastika never had any anti Jewish sentiment. So why should they surrender their symbol for the actions of a crazed European? By this logic we must also deem the cross a hateful symbol and ban it-since it is used by the KKK to terrorize people. Not to mention the cross was an omnipresent symbol during the Inquisition which lasted for centuries and impacted multiple parts of the world
Thanks to the students that support Beatology and to those that do not, OPEN AND READ SOME BOOKS WITH REAL INFORMATION and we will be back. Thanks for the publicty
You sell T-shirts with a symbol that, in the western world, is widely reviled as representing hate, and you think it’s great publicity?
It has helped my brands tremendously. Thanks again. Smart folks understand and accept my actions. Research #ManWoman
How pathetic that someone like Claire Hill could be a student at USC. Her comments are just plain stupid and insensitive.
The fact that you printed her diatribe was completely wrong lowering the newspaper to her level of antisemitism, and not
free speech.
What’s more pathetic is that you have no understanding or appreciation of Claire’s point of view.  A university campus must offer differing points of view so students can learn and grow from those interactions.  You sound like you are caught up in the “sheeple” mentality whereby there is one correct way of thinking and everyone has to mindlessly follow the leader without question.  Anyone who disagrees with that viewpoint must be quashed at any cost.  That, sir, is just plain stupid, to use your own words.
You are a complete idiot without a doubt. The symbol promotes nothing but hate, but of course what do you know of the Holocaust and what the Nazi’s stood for against Jews and the rest of Europe. It is not about correctness when it is absolutely disgraceful. Tell me what the different point of view could be in this case.
Hope you didn’t get educated at USC with  your lack of knowledge. If you are Curious learn what that symbol
really stands for, and about all the men who lost their lives fighting against it.
Not sure what you are really saying. But if you did not know – the swastika is much more than a Nazi symbol. Visit a vast swath of
Asia even today and you will find it all over the place-daubed on
temples, houses, stores, vehicles, wedding invitations and what have you
 as a symbol of good luck. And these countries and religions which
revere the Swastika never had any anti Jewish sentiment. So why should
they surrender their symbol for the actions of a crazed European?
The man was trying to educate clueless western folks that a world exists beyond them-but was shut down for his pains
No., moron.  It’s time to demystify the symbol.  Nigga!
Your childish crap of a reply is worthy of only one response. Go F yourself where it hurts. You are less than a moron!
How are her comments “plain stupid and insensitive?”  What was her “her level of antisemitism?”  
I cannot find any references she made to Jews or Semitic people.  You been smoking some powerful stuff before hitting the keyboard, Steve?

Undergraduate Student Government voter turnout increased by 46.2 percent from last year’s election, totaling 5,411 votes, according to numbers announced at the USG Senate meeting Tuesday night.
According to the USC USG Elections Facebook page, over 1,000 votes were cast in the first nine hours and 4,500 votes were cast by the beginning of the last day of voting on Feb. 9. Students voted both online and in-person at various on-campus locations.
The voter turnout by the beginning of Thursday already had superseded the 3,700 votes that were cast in the 2016 USG election.
Voter turnout in 2016 dropped by 39 percent when compared to the 6,027 votes cast in the 2015 USG election. 
Voting in the 2017 election took place from Feb. 7 to Feb. 9. Students received free food as an incentive for voting.
Kat Lee, the associate director of elections for USG, said that this increased turnout was due at least in part to intentional efforts made by USG to get people to cast ballots.
“From the beginning, our goal was to increase voter turnout from last year, so we’re very excited that we were able to keep that and make people engaged from all over the student body,” Lee said. “I think a lot of that came from the diverse people running. We had a lot of people who were new to USG, and that definitely made people more engaged.”
The Austin Dunn and Morgan Monahan ticket garnered 43.2 percent of the votes, while Rachel Udabe and Rebecca Harbeck acquired 28.9 percent of the votes and Daniel Million and Timothy Vorhoff received 27.9 percent of the votes.

Trousdale Parkway on Valentine’s Day was bedecked with booths selling roses and candies in addition to the usual club fundraisers. One booth, upon closer inspection, did not match the usual expectations: The Preloved Fashion Association hosted the first Spring Clothes Swap in conjunction with USC Housing and My Closet Cloud.
Students could walk up to the booth and get free clothes in exchange for donating some of their old ones. 
The idea came out of the association’s President Cherry Tung’s own experience. Tung, a senior studying accounting, noticed that she was always buying too many clothes, leading to a lack of closet space, seldom-worn clothes and overspending. This led her to notice the waste in the fashion industry, especially on a campus like USC, where trends seem to change every week, and students want to keep up with the latest trends but aren’t sure what to do with their old clothes.
Tung’s observation is certainly supported by a quick scan of the Free & For Sale Facebook group. On any given day, multiple people put up old clothes to sell at a fraction of the price, but often, these individual sellers have a difficult time finding people interested because of the stigma around second-hand clothing and buying from other students. These unsold items are often then wasted, either thrown away or left to rot in the back of someone’s closet until graduation day.
“Our short-term goal is to reduce waste in the community, and our long-term goal is to eliminate the stigma against second hand clothes,” Tung said.
The Spring Clothes Swap itself was born out of a partnership between the association and USC Housing’s sustainability coordinator Erin Fabris as a way to reduce waste and continue working to make USC’s campus sustainable. Bins were set up at CSC offices around campus right after winter break to collect old clothes that students didn’t want anymore, which were then collected by the association in preparation for Tuesday’s Spring Clothes Swap. 
Kate Mahony, a sophomore majoring in communication, got a chance to browse some of the clothes. 
“I thought there was a good selection, a good range of pants, shirts, sweaters, dresses, a lot of variety,” Mahony said.
Andrew Hurlow, a senior majoring in business administration, said he joined the project for philanthropic reasons. 
“[We] want to promote a sense of reusability and sustainability through the USC community and give back to the community,” Hurlow said. “A lot of people [got] clothes, and a lot of people came away [understanding] that just because it was donated by someone else doesn’t mean it’s long forgotten.”

The 2017 USC Global Health Case Competition was held at the Health Sciences Campus on Tuesday. Undergraduate and graduate students were challenged to propose solutions to a case in front of USC faculty and global expert judges, and the winning team will represent USC at the International Emory Global Health Competition in Atlanta, Ga. on March 25. 
To qualify for the USC Global Health Case Competition, teams of five members from at least three different USC schools were challenged with designing sustainable, innovative and low cost operating rooms which could meet cleft palate surgical needs in Nicaragua. 
The winning team of the USC Global Health Case Competition comprised of Brantynn Washington, Ashley Millhouse, Julian Cernuda, Hrant Gevorgian and Cristina Gago.  Winners of this case competition will represent USC in Atlanta, Ga. at the fifth International Emory Global Health Competition. 
EGHI has focused on global health-related cases for six years now, offering international and domestic undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to propose solutions to critical global health issues. Last year, students from 24 universities came together at the international competition to develop strategies for preventing and treating obstetric fistula in India. Students from USC received an honorable mention in 2012. 
This year’s winning team at USC presented a holistic, multidisciplinary approach to the case, developing a solution using solar-powered autoclaves, unused medical equipment, online technical repair forums and building recycling and storage containers. Their goal was to create a system which can work anywhere in the world, using solely sustainable equipment.
Freddie Brindopke, a judge for the competition, said that the winning team had a unique strategy.
“There were a lot of really good presentations today, but a lot of them only took one angle,” Brindopke said. “This team really took a whole, comprehensive approach.” 
A judge’s panel of USC faculty and global experts such as Brindopke, the project manager of Operation Smile and project coordinator of Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, critiqued the teams’ creativity, innovation, quantitative and qualitative analysis, strategies of implementation and delivery. 
“It was done in a very professional manner. You could tell they put a lot of time into it, and they were all in sync with the presentation,” Brindopke said about the winning team. 
Each team was required to present their analyses and proposals in a Microsoft PowerPoint, and was given only 15 minutes to present and 10 minutes to answer questions from the judges. 
“It was very humbling to win because we were against teams from everything ranging from education, social work, business school, engineering, physicians, so it really just was wonderful to see all of the ideas,” said Millhouse, a master’s student in public health.
Team members will travel on their own to the international competition, which comprises of global multidisciplinary guest university teams. Here, Washington, Millhouse, Cernuda, Gevorgian and Gago will face a new challenge and compete with other students from all around the world. 
“I really wish we had more opportunities like this,” Millhouse said. “For people all over the world to come together because I think that’s where feasible solutions really happen.”

After a dominant performance between the pipes for the No. 2 USC women’s water polo team over the weekend, junior goalie Victória Chamorro was named MPSF Player of the Week for the first time in her career.
The Rio de Janeiro, Brazil native was locked in on defense down in La Jolla, Calif. at the Triton Invitational, recording 19 saves in just two games. Her standout performance in the championship match against No. 5 Arizona State included 12 saves, which helped USC (14-0) secure its fourth consecutive Triton Invitational crown.
In Saturday’s game against No. 17 San Diego State, Chamorro stopped seven shots in just three periods of work and allowed only two goals to lead USC to a 17-4 victory over the Aztecs.
USC came away unscathed in pool play, and after a win in the semifinals of the tournament against No. 6 Michigan, Chamorro would once again man the cage for USC against MPSF rival Arizona State. After giving up one goal early in the first frame, she silenced the Sun Devils in the second and fourth periods and allowed just one more goal en route to the 12-2 win in the title match. Chamorro’s strength and quickness bothered Arizona State the entire evening, as she tallied a couple of key steals and finished with 12 stops in goal. In total, she allowed just four goals over the weekend.
The 2016 Rio Olympian leads USC with a 2.48 goals allowed per game average, only letting 13 goals get past her so far this season. In 21 total periods of work, she has recorded 55 saves for a 10.48 saves per game average and leads a stingy USC defense that allows just 3.36 goals per game, compared to the team’s 18.5 goals per game scoring average.
The junior is also ranked No. 6 all-time in the USC record books for career saves. In her freshman season, her 207 saves were the most ever recorded by a first-year goalie at USC and the ninth most in program history. For her efforts in 2015, Chamorro was named to the MPSF All-Newcomer Team and earned All-American Honorable Mention status.
As a sophomore last season, she helped USC capture the program’s fifth national championship with a 6.7 saves per game average.
Chamorro and the Trojans will now head down to Irvine, Calif., to take part in the 2017 UCI Invitational. Action begins on Feb. 24 and will conclude Feb. 26 at the Anteater Aquatics Center.

Following a 7-0 sweep of San Diego State, the No. 22 USC women’s tennis team prepares for a matchup with its crosstown rival, No. 20 UCLA. The Bruins will come to Marks Stadium on Saturday for a noon tilt with the Trojans. The match, however, will not count toward Pac-12 play.
But despite the fact that it doesn’t have direct conference implications, pride will be at stake, as is the case with any matchup between the Trojans and Bruins. The match has significant weight towards the annual Crosstown Cup, with the winner of Saturday’s match taking home 5 points (out of 10 allotted for the sport) for their school. USC has won the Crosstown Cup 10 out of the past 15 years, but the Trojans are currently trailing 45-35 to the Bruins. A win this weekend against their historic rival would help the Trojans’ cause significantly.
The Bruins are led by freshman Ena Shibahara, currently ranked No. 3 in the ITA rankings, and No. 91 redshirt freshman Jada Hart. Both women have been selected as Pac-12 Player of the Week recently, with Hart getting the honor on Jan. 30 and Shibahara a week later on Feb. 6. The doubles team of Hart and Shibahara is currently ranked No. 12 in the country. The doubles team of Hart and junior Terry Fleming is also ranked at No. 38. Before their match with USC, UCLA will host Pepperdine on Friday in Westwood.
The Trojans have time to wait and prepare for the Bruins. With a 7-0 sweep of San Diego State nearly two weeks ago, the Trojans improved their record to 3-1 on the season. Despite its win over the Aztecs, USC slipped from No. 18 to No. 22 in the ITA rankings. Junior Gabby Smith, went from unranked to the No. 25 singles player in the country. Smith, currently riding a nine-match win streak will look to keep the train rolling. Smith’s impressive run has included beating five ranked opponents. Other Trojans in the ITA top 100 include sophomore Jessica Failla (No. 61), senior Zoë Katz (No. 62) and junior Madison Westby (No. 82). In the ITA doubles rankings, the pair of Katz and Westby rose from the No. 27 to the No. 14 ranking. USC has two other ranked doubles teams including Katz and Smith (No. 47) and Failla and sophomore Rianna Valdes (No. 55).
In a historically close matchup, USC has a slight lead over their rival Bruins with a 50-44 all-time record. In their last matchup with UCLA in April 2016, the Trojans defended their home court with a 4-1 win that sent USC to the Pac-12 Championship.
Weather conditions on Friday led to a cancellation of USC’s matchup against No. 1 Florida, and the match will not be rescheduled. With 17 days between their win against San Diego State and their match against their rival from Westwood, the Trojans will be well rested, while the Bruins will have to recover quickly from their match on Friday.
Coach Gallien has been a fixture long enough without a title, and this year’s team is one of the lower ranked
ones during his tenure. No law says he can’t recruit a top five or ten player. Obviously the appeal has disappeared
to play for him.

Geno Auriemma barely reacted when the buzzer sounded to signal his 100th straight victory.
Behind him, a sold-out crowd decked in white T-shirts roared in support of the victory. WNBA stars Maya Moore and Breanna Stewart made their way to the court to hug their former coach. But for the Hall of Fame coach, the moment was more of a breath of relief than a milestone victory.
It was, after all, just another win.
UConn women’s basketball is the most dominant athletic program in the history of sports. Period. The Patriots, the Yankees, the Celtics, the Crimson Tide — they don’t even come close. No team has ever won this much and this big for this long without even flinching. We’ll probably never see it again.
In their recent win-streak, the Huskies clinched 98 of those victories by double-digit margins. Of those games, 56 were won by 40 or more points.
That streak extends into last season, when UConn won its fourth-straight national championship and graduated the first, second and third picks in the WNBA draft. With 11 total championship rings, Auriemma still has yet to lose an NCAA championship game.
They’re the best. No one can dispute that. But as Auriemma and his Huskies continue to eviscerate the rest of the NCAA, it raises the question — is all this winning good for women’s basketball?
It’s not that dominant teams are inherently bad for the game. My home team, the Kansas Jayhawks, is one of the most dominant programs in college basketball. Head coach Bill Self has more Big 12 championship rings than home losses in his 14-year tenure in Lawrence. As a fan, I’m not complaining.
But that dynasty isn’t bulletproof. Just a few weeks ago, Kansas dropped a home game to an unranked Iowa State team. That is, after all, the fun of college basketball, and of any sport — anyone can win.
It’s why we call it March Madness, why we sit on the edge of our seats even when the Patriots are down by a handful of touchdowns in the Super Bowl. Because it doesn’t matter how invincible Steph Curry looks when he’s taking that 30-foot jump shot — even he can lose a 3-1 lead.
But when it comes to collegiate women’s sports, the competition just isn’t the same.
College sports for women haven’t been around for as long. Take basketball for example — women didn’t even start playing five-on-five full court until 1971. The first NCAA women’s basketball championship took place in 1982, a full 43 years after the first men’s championship took place.
Because of this, women’s sports are still growing. And amid all of the debates surrounding equal pay and equal coverage, an important issue is missed — how a smaller pool of prospects keeps talent from being equally spread.
With fewer post-collegiate options for female athletes, the competition for collegiate athletics is lower. A few great teams can snap up the top talent, leaving a gaping canyon of talent between ranked and unranked squads.
More than the lack of dunks or the smaller 3-point arc, this disparity in talent is what makes women’s basketball less fun to watch.
So why UConn? That’s easy to answer. Auriemma was named the U.S. women’s national team head coach in 2001. Since then, he’s won 10 NCAA championships and three Olympic gold medals.
The method of recruiting athletes is clear — if you want to be the best, play with the best. It’s hard to argue against the undefeated U.S. coach when defining who is the best coach in the nation. So Auriemma gets the best, year after year.
That has to change. For women’s basketball to be taken seriously, for the game to grow at every level, something will have to give. And as impressive as it is, the end of the UConn dynasty will be the best thing to happen to women’s basketball.
If you don’t believe me, look to NCAA women’s soccer.
For decades, North Carolina stood in the same dominant shoes as UConn basketball, winning 21 national titles in the 34 years that the College Cup has existed. For the entirety of that time, Anson Dorrance served as the head coach. For the first eight years, he also served as the American head coach, just like Auriemma.
North Carolina starters and alumni made up over half of the U.S. roster for almost a decade. Players went to North Carolina because they wanted to play for America, and in the process the Tar Heels created a culture of dominance.
But women’s soccer has changed since then. Thanks to Mia Hamm, Abby Wambach and Alex Morgan, women’s soccer has earned more viewers, more fans and more support with each passing year. And as talent and interest continued to spread, the Tar Heels have won less and less, with new programs rising in the rankings and our own Trojans taking the title this year.
It’s time for that diversity of talent to seep into women’s basketball.
It’s not anything that UConn is doing wrong. They’re just recruiting the best players to the best program with the best coach and winning. A lot. It’s easy to hate the Huskies for winning, but it’s hard to fault them for continuing to succeed. But now it’s time for the playing field to begin to level in women’s basketball.
For now, we can celebrate their legacy. But down the road, when that win streak is snapped and the NCAA trophy is hoisted year after year by a coach other than Auriemma — it will be a victory.
The legacy of women’s basketball will be much more than a collection of dynasties. And though the Huskies might reign now, the sport will truly flourish when it becomes any woman’s game.

It all starts on Friday. 
After fall ball, intersquad scrimmages and practice after practice, baseball season is finally here. And for a USC team that missed the NCAA tournament last year, it’s a shot at a lengthier campaign.
“It’s been a little monotonous just doing intersquads and practice. It’s nice to have umpires, fans and playing someone else that you don’t necessarily know,” senior outfielder Corey Dempster said. 
The team looks quite different from last season. The Trojans lost a third of their players to the MLB draft last summer and have brought in 15 new faces to fill the void. 
“I think [the newcomers] play a huge role,” redshirt junior infielder Frankie Rios said. “We have a lot of good pitchers coming in, so I think they are going to get a lot of innings.”
The Trojans lost eight pitchers to the draft but gained seven through transfers and freshmen. The team also lost four of its most productive hitters to the draft: Jeremy Martinez, AJ Ramirez, Timmy Robinson and David Oppenheim. 
“The scary part is that, for the last two years, we have basically put the same lineup out there,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “We’re cautiously optimistic that we have the people in place to go out there and do a good job.”
Hubbs stressed the importance of the players staying themselves and not trying to replace those who left or graduated. 
“We don’t have as much power as we had the last two years,” he said. “We’re going to rely on more guys being able to get on base and run and do some different things to generate offense.”

Of the 13 players who were drafted, only Dempster chose to stay at USC.
“I was more interested in getting my degree than starting my pro ball career,” he said. “I’d learn much more during this year than trying to start pro ball early and getting forgotten about in a pro ball system.” 
Dempster had been drafted by the Yankees in the 37th round. 
Players are eligible to be drafted by a major league team after their sophomore year and, like many other college athletes, many cannot pass up the offers that the teams give.
“I started with Corey, AJ Fritts, and David Edson. We’re the only ones standing from our class,” Rios said. “I’m excited to go out with them — go out with a bang.”
With the incoming 15 players and several redshirts, there will be plenty of new faces to watch.
“AJ Fritts is the comeback kid,” Dempster said. “He hit a home run his first at-bat freshman year and hasn’t seen any playing time since. He’s worked his butt off all three years, and it’s finally starting to pay off.”
Senior catcher Fritts has been on the team since his freshman year but has only recorded three career plate appearances, one in each year. 
In addition to Fritts, Hubbs mentioned sophomore infielder and outfielder Lars Nootbaar as a player to look out for. Nootbaar hit .238 last season in 33 games. 
“Nootbaar really looks like he is primed to have a big year,” Hubbs said. “He’s going to hit third for us, and he’s the guy that we think has the chance to be in the conversation for best hitters in the conference.” 
Given the newcomers, team chemistry is more of a focus this year than in years past.
“Our team is more put-together, both with team camaraderie and chemistry. I think we’re going to have a lot more fun than previous years,” Dempster said. “Because of that, we’re going to win more games and have fun winning, rather than just hoping to win.”
Some of the highlights of the season will be when the Trojans take on San Diego, Michigan and UCLA in the annual Dodger Stadium College Baseball Classic. Before that, USC also makes a trip to North Carolina to take on Wake Forest and Duke.
“Traveling to North Carolina to play Wake Forest and Duke will be a good experience — it’s the farthest trip we’ve had,” Dempster said. “It’s always fun to travel to play everyone. The UCLA series is always fun since they’re our hometown rival.”
Conference play will not be easy for USC this season, with five top 35 teams in the Pac-12 according to the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association: No. 7 Oregon State, No. 16 Arizona, No. 23 Stanford, No. 26 Washington and No. 35 Arizona State.
“I think Oregon State on paper is probably the team to beat,” Hubbs said. “I like a challenge. I think the depth of our conference is better than just [a few] teams being ranked, though.”
Before the team turns its attention to league play in March, however, USC looks to start strong in its non-conference slate. The Trojans will take on Coppin State in a three-game, season-opening series starting Friday at 6 p.m. 
Believe  you have to stay three years before eligible for the draft unless the rule changed recently.
Hubbs has only himself to blame for lack of hitting. Lot of seniors last season giving him time to
recruit some hitters the last couple of years to fill the roster. Pitching has good potential if they can
stay healthy like Hart and Crouse. The program has had way too many seasons of being mediocre
since the early 2K when Mark Prior was the man.

Last year at the Emmy’s, screenwriter, producer, director and actor Alan Yang delivered an eye-opening speech on the importance of media diversity as he stepped on stage to receive his award.
“Asian parents out there, if you could just do me a favor and just a couple of you get your kids cameras instead of violins, we would be all good,” Yang said in his Emmy speech, eliciting good-natured laughter from his audience.
Yang is the headliner for the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly’s annual speaker event in Bovard Auditorium, which will take place on Friday night.
APASA is one of nine assemblies of Undergraduate Student Government’s Program Board. The organization programs and advocates for Asian Pacific American students on campus, providing funding and marketing for various student organizations.
Last year, APASA invited actress Constance Wu from the popular television series Fresh Off the Boat to headline the speaker event. Wu inspired students with her compelling story about breaking into Hollywood as an Asian American actress, an industry where Asian Americans experience limited screentime. This year, Alan Yang will continue to inspire students and show that the Asian American community will not be bound by Hollywood stereotypes.
“We hope that APA students can learn from a role model in the entertainment industry — one in which there is traditionally less APA representation,” said Michelle Su, the Events Coordinator for APASA. “Since the event appeals to a larger audience as well, we hope that the general USC community can benefit from the talk with Alan and that the topics discussed can help to build a greater sense of community.”
Yang grew up in San Bernardino, Calif. to Taiwanese immigrant parents and went on to study biology at Harvard University, though Yang always had a passion for comedy writing and veered from biology to be a screenwriter. He first wrote for Last Call with Carson Daly in 2009. From there, he became a producer and consultant for Comedy Central’s South Park, and then finally landed a steady role as a writer for NBC’s Parks and Recreation.
However, Yang may be best known for co-creating the Emmy award-winning Netflix original series Master of None with comedian Aziz Ansari. Master of None follows Indian American actor Dev, played by Aziz Ansari, as he faces issues of love, stereotypes, friendship and family as a millennial living in New York City. The show is witty and thoughtful, capturing Ansari’s humor but at the same time working to break down stereotypes that many Asian Americans face on a daily basis.
Master of None was nominated for four Emmy awards, with Yang and Ansari winning Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series in 2016 for the episode “Parents.” The episode looks closely at the immigration journey of Dev and Brian’s parents and the sacrifices they made by coming to America for a better life.
Yang is set to speak Friday at 6:30 p.m. in Bovard Auditorium. Students can also win a chance to attend a Meet and Greet by entering a Facebook contest on USC APASA’s page.

It is near impossible to watch Girls without constantly thinking of the show’s creator, Lena Dunham, a fallen-from-grace millennial icon whose recent statements push her into problematic territory. There’s the comment she made about Odell Beckham Jr. ignoring her at the annual Met Gala because he, in her eyes, didn’t deem her sexy enough. There’s the comment about not including more characters of color in Girls, which is set in New York City, because she lacked personal understanding of their lives. And then, there’s the comment about wishing she has experienced abortion. 
The conversation of whether we can or should separate an artist from her work will go on for as long as art exists. But with the premiere of the sixth and final season of Girls airing on HBO last Sunday, the show is preparing to enter a long, rich history of past television, and viewers are now able to consider not only its merits but also what role it played in the social dynamics of its time. And I believe that after this season finishes, we’re better off that a show like this existed on HBO. 
Girls isn’t an honest portrayal of New York; it wasn’t created by someone who gives her full effort in trying to understand how society works, but it’s the first series I’ve ever consumed where the idea of femininity was challenged — where women were not just objects who wanted and were wanted, but who romp through the world as if it were theirs. And it is.
Girls has always been committed to its devilishly honest portrayal of young womanhood, in all its curves, tears and complications. And yet, this season’s premiere seemed more tiresome and inconsequential than most past episodes. It was as if the writers, unsure where to take the sprawling and weaving relationships they had built up for five seasons, instead decided to hit them on the head over and over with dry self-awareness. For example, Marnie and Ray call each other “baby” again and again, Jessa and Adam wrestle nude over a carton of yogurt, and Hannah returns more bumbling and disengaged from reality than ever before. What’s new? 
Interestingly, I have never been a fan of Dunham’s Hannah. And actually, I don’t really watch the show for any of the individual characters at all. It’s more the relatable and realistic parsing of friendships and romances that I find worth coming back for. It is always somewhat disconcerting to me how many relationships Hannah seems to dip in and out of, simply because she speaks so bluntly and behaves so selfishly. Throughout the show, she displays narcissism and childish immaturity, and yet also a carpe diem attitude that is hard not to admire. But it seems like Dunham’s character returned from season five almost a caricature of herself: the nuances painted externally instead of internally. 
For the first time in Girls I can remember, there was a bounty of body humor the likes of which I haven’t seen on the show before. Part of me wants to celebrate scenes of Hannah struggling, nude, out of a wetsuit or pulling up her dress to messily slather sunscreen on her legs, for normalizing the female body. But that’s what Girls has always done, which is why this season premiere feels a little different — the jokes feel cheap. I don’t want to laugh at Hannah’s foibles around her body, I want to laugh because she makes situations feel honest and organically funny. Girls has proven they can do that. Laughing at female bodies reduces both the writing and the women on the show. And that’s not what Girls has historically been. That’s not what Girls wants.
And yet, that is where the Catch 22 of the show lies. Maybe we don’t like the jokes. Maybe we don’t like Hannah. But we like her for being unlikeable and comfortable with her body and on top of that, having a boyfriend who looks like Adam Driver. This is also why a show like Girls is so necessary, even in its problematic foundations and mistakes. Plainly and confidently, it demonstrates that girls are messy and complicated and flawed. They are not ideals, and sometimes they want something or someone they can’t have. They’re not always the unattainable, aloof beauties decades of television want us to believe they are  — girls are individuals. They crave cupcakes and yogurt; they take the reins in relationships. And sometimes, they think only of themselves.

Boba fanatics at USC all recognize the unspoken rule. In order to find decent, accessible boba, one must venture beyond the Law Cafe or Dean’s List to one of two off-campus locations: Cup O’ Joy or It’s Boba Time. But when given the option to choose between the two locations, sometimes it becomes difficult to one’s advantages over the other. 
In terms of pricing, both Cup O’ Joy and It’s Boba Time charge approximately $3 to $4 for a regular-sized drink. Given almost identical prices, deciding between Cup O’ Joy and It’s Boba Time really boils down to what one is looking for in one’s boba drink. 
Lychee Tea with Lychee Jelly
Cup O’ Joy’s regular lychee green tea with coconut jelly provided a strong syrupy flavor; it contains a refreshing taste. The coconut jelly complemented the green tea, enhancing the tea’s sweetness. However, the tea itself was weak, with none of the rich herbal hints one can expect from well-steeped tea. The tea tasted much more like a fruit juice than a tea, and even as a fruit juice it was heavily artificial with very little natural fruit flavor: The drink entered with a concentrated sugary profile but left a mildly bitter aftertaste. This aftertaste was half-covered by the sweet lychee jelly, which, in addition to disguising the bitterness, also added a fun texture to the drink. 
It’s Boba Time did not sell pure lychee tea; instead its lychee green tea was mixed into a peach lychee iced tea (which was essentially a lychee green tea with peach fruit bits). The peach lychee iced tea had a less blatantly artificial flavor than its Cup O’ Joy counterpart — perhaps part of this was due to the fact that it incorporated real peach fruit to give it a more natural sweetness. Along with tasting less artificial, the peach lychee iced tea was also milder, and the tea profile was much stronger: instead of being syrupy sweet, the flavor focused on the green tea and incorporated subtle hints of lychee and peach. Most of the sweetness came from the lychee jelly, allowing the jelly to serve an independent purpose from the tea and also allowing the tea and the jelly to symbiotically coexist to create a more complex flavor profile.
Winner: It’s Boba Time
Jasmine Green Tea with Boba
Similar to its lychee tea, Cup O’ Joy’s jasmine green tea focused its spotlight on the sweetness of the tea rather than the tea flavor itself. At 100 percent sweetness, the sugary taste drowned out most of the green tea essence, surpassing even its extraordinarily sweet boba. While the resulting flavor was far from unpleasant, the tea did not offer respite from the boba’s onslaught of sugar. Instead, the boba used its glutinous texture to buffer the intensely sweet tea, releasing the sugar in a strong but steady stream. The boba itself retained a soft and chewy texture — much softer than usual boba and slightly sweeter than expected.
The jasmine green tea sold at It’s Boba Time was far less sweet and far richer in its green tea profile than its Cup O’ Joy counterpart. Even at mild concentration, the jasmine flavor stood out from the delicate sweetness, making the drink much more a tea and much less a dessert. The boba was also less pliant and less sweet than that of Cup O’ Joy, creating for a much more texture-filled (as opposed to flavor-filled) experience.
Winner: It’s Boba Time
The Final Verdict
In choosing between Cup O’ Joy and It’s Boba Time, the real question is one of flavor — those preferring sweet drinks to tea-flavored drinks might enjoy Cup O’ Joy better, whereas fans of high tea quality would probably prefer It’s Boba Time. Ultimately, the best boba place near USC is It’s Boba Time.

After years of protesting and expressing their discomfort, students at Yale University successfully convinced their university’s administration that the name of John C. Calhoun College should be changed. The University announced that the name of Yale alumnus Grace Murray Hopper would be replacing that of the controversial Yale alumnus and 19th-century American politician. This change comes in the wake of pressure from movements all over the country dedicated to re-evaluating historical buildings that bear the titles of controversial figures.
USC is no stranger to this pressure. The Daily Trojan published a column over a year ago that called for renaming the USC Von KleinSmid Center in light of allegations raised against former USC President Rufus B. von KleinSmid’s character. Urban legends and rumors about von KleinSmid abound, but few have credibility. However, let it be known that there is no doubt as to von KleinSmid’s loyalty to the theories of eugenics — he delivered a presentation on the topic in 1913 and spoke very highly of intensely controversial topics, such as sterilization of the “unfit” and compulsory institutionalization of the mentally disabled. Practices like these represent a horrific threat to civil rights and liberties, which goes without saying, but von KleinSmid did much more over the course of his life than advocate for debunked and dangerous theories of pseudoscience.
Documented facts about von KleinSmid’s positive contributions to USC are numerous. These facts include such distinctions as secularizing the University in 1928 (it was a Methodist institution in its early years). Additionally, under von KleinSmid’s leadership, the University’s student body swelled in size and diversity. Finally, von KleinSmid’s dedication to international affairs, cooperation and education helped create one of the first schools of international relations in the world — right here at USC. Clearly, von KleinSmid’s influence over the development of USC in its most formative time was critical to the creation of the modern, international university that we now attend.
With greater access to information, it is very easy to draw attention to a historical figure’s faults, both perceived and real. In many cases, rightfully so, the theories of eugenics that von KleinSmid supported were undeniably used as an excuse to marginalize and do great harm to minority groups in the 20th century and so ought to be spurned. Yet, spurning those theories does not necessitate the erasure of von KleinSmid’s legacy.
Erasing the names of historical figures like von KleinSmid also erases recognition of their contributions to the communities that they served — communities that we are members of. That some historical figures held views contrary to modern conceptions of morality should drive students to discuss and seek understanding of those views, not to clamor for their proponents’ erasure. It would be ridiculous to argue, for example, that Abraham Lincoln’s exalted name and immense contributions to the United States should not be remembered because of the documented fact that he did not believe in the inherent equality of white people and people of color.  Likewise, von KleinSmid held unsavory views, and those views ought to be freely criticized; but he also spurred the University’s growth from a denominational college to a reputable and secular research institution. To remove his name would pay short shrift to his critical guidance of the University.
The names of buildings on USC’s campus should be reserved for those who have made the greatest contributions to the Trojan community. Since the Von KleinSmid Center is the among the most visible and central buildings on USC’s campus, it is appropriate that it be reserved to honor the legacy of one of USC’s most influential administrators. Certainly, there are past and present members of the Trojan family who have also made momentous contributions to the USC community and have less controversy attached to their names than Rufus B. von KleinSmid. Norman Topping is one of them; Minnie C. Miltimore is another. 
That those individuals should be remembered and commemorated is not in question. What is being debated is if it is proper to censor the name and recognition of a pivotal figure in USC’s history in order to make more room for them. When the weight of each figure’s contributions to USC are compared, it clearly is not. The name of the Von KleinSmid Center should remain the same, but that should not stop Trojans from requesting that figures like Topping and Miltimore get recognition of their own by naming future University buildings after them, as well.

Good call. It shames an institution to discard its history and heritage to comply with “political correctness.” Dr. Von Kleinsmid was speaking about a concept that was in style in 1913. Today, the concept is certainly unpopular. His contributions beyond that were large and USC should not discard its heritage because of political correctness over some of his social theories of 1913. And Yale? Boo to them for being politically correct and discarding their history. RADM Grace Hopper was a national treasure and certainly Yale should be proud of her. So name the next new building after that wonderful computer scientist who gave us so much – don’t throw away the history of Yale.

This week, after years of student pushback, the president of Yale University announced that it would rename a residential college named for John Calhoun, a 19th-century defender of slavery, replacing it with computer scientist Grace Murray Hopper. 
In light of this step, USC should finally rename the Von KleinSmid Center, named for noted supporter of eugenics and the University’s fifth president, Rufus B. von KleinSmid. Yale’s decision sets the example that a concentrated student effort can eventually receive results. 
By now, many students have heard the story behind von KleinSmid. He was a passionate supporter of forced sterilization programs, and he co-founded the Human Betterment Association, a leading eugenics organization. Forced sterilization programs were part of a dark but rarely discussed period in America — and especially in California — which played a large role in popularizing the practice. Von KleinSmid’s view of these programs was clear. In a paper titled “Eugenics and the State,” he wrote, “The application of the principles of Eugenics to organized society is one of the most important duties of the social scientist of the present generation.” 
Von KleinSmid also has a history of racism, notably withholding transcripts to colleges enrolling Japanese American citizens after their release from internment camps in 1945. These actions clearly contradict USC’s values as a diverse and inclusive global university and should be enough to warrant the removal of von KleinSmid’s name from one of our University’s most visible buildings. While von KleinSmid was undoubtedly an influential USC administrator and helped the University progress, his public values are very much at odds with what the University is striving toward today. If USC wants to be a progressive university open to students from all backgrounds, it needs to strip the very building dedicated to international studies of a name tainted by racism and discrimination. 
USC has seemingly endless prominent alumni and past administrators who made valuable, positive contributions to our University community. If it were entirely up to me, Minnie C. Miltimore is the first USC alumni who comes to mind who is deserving of more recognition on campus. Miltimore — a woman — was USC’s first valedictorian in the school’s graduating class of 1884.  Very little additional information is easily available on Miltimore, and her name is not prominently visible on campus. Naming a building after her would speak to the University’s commitment to its past by recognizing the first graduating class, while marking its commitment to progress and continued commitment to empowering women in higher education. 
Realistically, USC would probably either name the building after a top donor or after another former school administrator. In the vein of past University presidents, Norman Topping presents a much more positive representation of our University’s history than von KleinSmid. 
During Topping’s 12-year term as president, he raised over $100 million for the University in around five years. Also under Topping, USC entered the Association of American Universities and began to transform its image from a regional to a national university. These actions had a lasting impact on USC students today, as USC continues to be recognized as a leading national and international institution. Unlike von KleinSmid, Topping’s activities outside of USC had a largely positive impact. He was widely regarded in the medical field and helped develop a vaccine against typhus that is still used today. He also had a vested interest in USC’s surrounding community, serving as president of the Los Angeles Transit Authority after his tenure at USC ended. 
Also, unlike most other past University presidents, Topping both studied at and presided over USC, demonstrating his strong connection to the Trojan family. Topping received his bachelor’s and his medical degree from USC. Naming the building for Topping would allow USC to recognize students, alumni and University administration with one action. While Topping’s name is currently recognized through the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund and a building on the health sciences campus, it should also be recognized through a physical building on USC’s main campus. 
Norman Topping is a solid and fitting choice as the potential new name for VKC. However, the point remains that there simply needs to be a new name for VKC — but if students want this to happen, it will require a concentrated effort, as it did at Yale.

On Monday, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee announced that the city will make community college free. This decision comes in a tumultuous time for education, with the controversy of Betsy DeVos’ appointment as Secretary of Education still raising questions about the future state of public education in our country. While San Francisco’s declaration sheds light on the plight of lower- and middle-class America and the worth of scholarship programs like USC’s, the efficacy of free higher education remains questionable. 
Funding for San Francisco’s free city colleges will come from “an increase in the real estate transfer tax for commercial and residential properties valued at more than $5 million.” Essentially, the wealthier citizens of San Francisco will have their houses more heavily taxed to pay off tuition. This program is expected to help 30,000 students obtain an associate’s degree for free. While this decision is aimed to aid lower-income students, there are no rules for who can enroll, so wealthy students would be able to seize the opportunity as well. However, given the privilege that higher-income families can afford to send their children to four-year institutions, it would be exploitative to take advantage of a system built to give low-income students a level playing ground. At the very least, however, individuals with higher incomes would be paying disproportionately higher taxes to fund the free college program.
The idea of “free” education, popularized by former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, sounds encouraging, but its flaws must be acknowledged. This tax will merely offset but not cover amenities like books and supplies, which cost roughly $1,700 a year. Additionally, this only applies to community colleges, and while they are higher education, the job market is still bleak without a bachelor’s or master’s degree, which offer much higher professional growth rates, position availability flexibility. But that being said, attending community college is still a vehicle for socioeconomic mobility that poor students are much better off with than without.
 Lack of affordability for higher education is an unresolved issue that has increasingly plagued our nation’s lower and middle classes. In the United States, education has simultaneously become not only a requirement but also increasingly unattainable. One study conducted by the New York Times in 2016 showed that public education directly correlates with annual income, and students in sixth grade in the wealthiest areas of the United States are educationally four grade levels ahead of students in the poorest areas, as public schools garner additional money through property taxes. Lack of funding for poorer schools guarantees less opportunity for later success and scholarships, which further diminishes hope for higher education, rendering free college a solution that comes too late. 
Private universities like USC have attempted to combat this with aid and merit scholarships, some offering full tuition: About 28 percent of students enrolled for the fall 2016 term are receiving some type of merit-based scholarship. 
Additionally, approximately 13 percent of USC’s freshman class are first-generation college students, which may be demonstrate an upward trajectory. However, some merit-based scholarships focus not only on GPA, but also SAT and PSAT scores. The Trustee, Presidential and National Merit Scholarships (which comprise the majority of students receiving merit scholarships from USC) rely heavily on test scores. In fact, these admitted students make up the top 1-2 percent of ACT/SAT scores in the nation. These tests that most students are encouraged to take can be costly; students who are wealthier can also afford private tutoring and practice books. While scholarships were primarily built to encourage high-achieving poor students, they have become naturally skewed toward the wealthy.
There is no easy way to solve the modern education crisis. While free community college may decrease financial burden in the short-term, the long-term effects of such a program are minimal. Until there is equal opportunity for low-income students long before they consider applying to colleges, the U.S. educational system will continue to be underscored by  its vast income inequality gap.
Providing school choice and v I u her programs will help e erroneous to find ways to get their children a better education that what the Dept of Education has provided over the past 40 years or so.  This is another reason why DeVos will work towards the goal of providing a better educational opportunity for kids.  The DOJ has failed.  Teachers unions have failed.  They forgot what their mission is, and that is to educate our kids to get them to the next level.  
Teachers unions are about money and power, not providing kids with a qua L it education and school experi3nce.  Why do you think the unions are so vocal abiut the DeVos apointment?    Follow the money.
Personally, I would prefer to see the states have the mission of educating our kids, not the federal government.
