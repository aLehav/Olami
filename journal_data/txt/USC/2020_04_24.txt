USC has set plans for the Class of 2020’s virtual commencement ceremony, which will take place May 15, the originally set date for commencement, President Carol Folt announced in a Universitywide email Friday. The ceremony will include a conferment of degrees, performances and virtual events from individual schools.
“You have all let us know how important it is to share personal moments with your friends, mentors, loved ones, and your individual schools,” Folt wrote. “We hope to bring you that personal feeling with a meaningful, fun, and interactive celebration of your extraordinary accomplishments.”
Individual schools will hold virtual celebrations following the main ceremony, which Folt and Provost Charles Zukoski will kick off at 9 a.m. and will feature performances from the Spirit of Troy. The USC website will also display video, photo and livestream messages throughout the day from deans, staff, alumni and students celebrating the Class of 2020. USC is currently accepting media submissions to use on the webpage.
The University still plans to hold an in-person commencement in the future though details are still being determined, the email read. A date has not yet been set.
“You have achieved so much under extraordinary circumstances, and I could not be prouder of each and every one of you,” Folt wrote. “On behalf of the entire USC community, I salute you and look forward to joining you virtually on May 15 and in person when the time is right.”

Michael Pittman Jr. became the latest Trojan to join the NFL fraternity when the Indianapolis Colts selected the wide receiver with the 34th overall pick in the NFL Draft Friday. 
“I am super excited to be a Colt,” Pittman said in a video posted to the Colts’ Twitter. “Let’s bring the juice.”
Pittman will be the newest target for potential Hall of Fame quarterback Philip Rivers, who signed with the Colts this offseason after a lengthy career with the Los Angeles (formerly San Diego) Chargers.
“I just couldn’t be more happy that I get to start with a Hall of Fame quarterback,” Pittman said of Rivers. 
The Colts finished with a 7-9 record last season, third place in the AFC South, following the surprising retirement of quarterback Andrew Luck just a couple weeks before the season’s start. Pittman will look to help add to an Indianapolis offense that finished with the eighth-fewest total yards per game and the third-fewest passing yards per game last season. However, the Colts finished with 22.6 points per game last year, 16th in the NFL.
“I was almost certain that I was gonna be a Colt today,” Pittman said. “You see the blue shirt? … Just based on the conversations that we had. I felt like we had a good connection and I just felt like it was the right fit … I think that they brought me in to impact right now.”
Pittman is the 511th Trojan of all time to be drafted into the NFL, the most of any school in the nation.
Pittman was the eighth wide receiver selected in this year’s draft. He doesn’t profile as one of the faster receivers in his draft class — he ran a 4.52 40-yard dash at the NFL Draft Combine — but he has been lauded by scouts and draft analysts for his hands, size and ability to make contested catches downfield. Scouts also view Pittman as a potential special teams contributor, a role which he occasionally played during his college career.
“I feel like I try to be diverse in what I can do,” Pittman said. “I feel like I use my hands well. Being a bigger guy, people expect me to be physical and strong. So I have that, but I can also do all of the stuff that all of the smaller guys can.”
In 2019, Pittman proved himself to be one of the best receivers in the nation, finishing fourth in receptions and 10th in receiving yards en route to a nomination as a Biletnikoff Award finalist. He started all 13 games for the Trojans and was named to the All-Pac-12 First Team and AP All-American Second Team.
Pittman also won the 2019 Pop Warner College Award, given to a senior who made an impact on the field, in the classroom and in the community. A team captain for USC, Pittman won USC’s MVP, Community Service Award and Lifters Award.

When students at the Center for Advanced Manufacturing, an interdisciplinary center at the Viterbi School of Engineering, realized that healthcare workers are more likely to become infected with the coronavirus, they began modifying their robot, ADAMMS, into an ultraviolet light disinfection robot: ADAMMS-UV. In just six months, the robot will be able to aid overwhelmed hospitals by allowing healthcare workers to disinfect rooms safely from a remote location. 
The original robot is used in manufacturing, and  extracts 3D printed parts late at night when factory employees are not present to collect parts for printers to begin producing the next batch. The new robot builds on those functions and integrates them with UVC light sources — ultraviolet light with wavelengths between 200 and 280 nanometers — to break apart the DNA of viruses and bacteria, sterilizing the area the light reaches. 
“We realized that a lot of the functions that we have in [ADAMMS] can be easily transferred for its use in disinfection … In the previous application we had to open doors, open drawers and pick up objects,” said Shantanu Thakar, a doctorate student studying mechanical engineering and the robot development manager. “In this case, we have to do the same things except we needed to add a disinfection motion where we move the [robot] arm to disinfect.”
The robot consists of a UV pillar, a large, vertical ultraviolet light on top of the body of the robot that shines in all directions and disinfects the surrounding air. There’s also a UV wand that the robot arm holds to disinfect hard to reach areas. Once the robot approaches an item or area to disinfect, the user can select boundary points and the robot arm will calculate the motion to perform following sterilization standards. 
The ADAMMS-UV arm and hand can move in myriad directions and interact with objects such as drawers and doors, an aspect the CAM team realized made its robot special among current disinfection robots.
“Having our robot have an arm can make it more versatile and do things which existing technologies cannot — that’s some motivation that all of us had to form a team immediately and show everyone that this concept can be really useful in times like these,” Thakar said.  
While most of the team is working from home building different parts of the software, Hyojeong Kim, Pradeep Rajendran and Sarah Al-Hussaini are the only three students authorized to enter the CAM space to work physically with the robot. They integrate new software with the robot, test it, then provide feedback to the rest of the team. For Kim, who visited the lab nearly every day for two weeks in April, working in the lab by herself proved challenging. 
“It was challenging to do because I’d actually move the robot, and usually some person should watch the movement of the robot and stop it if something happens, but I was the only one who could work in the lab space,” said Kim, a graduate student studying computer science with a specialization in intelligent robotics.
The ADAMMS-UV software can currently only be used on desktop computers, but the team is working on making it available on smartphones, tablets and laptops to make it more accessible for healthcare workers. 
“It definitely works well in our lab, but that’s not the main target,” said Rishi Malhan, a doctorate student studying mechanical engineering who works on the ADAMMS-UV research team. “It needs more testing to make sure it’s more robust, and it needs a user interface to make it more intuitive and user-friendly for whoever is operating it.”
With limited funding and under present circumstances with the coronavirus, the team estimates it will take at least six months for the current version of the robot to be used in a real setting. With more funding, however, the team is considering including more features and physical capabilities.  
Rajendran and Al-Hussaini are interested in adding another arm since a two-armed robot would likely be faster and more intuitive for a human to control through telepresence. The robot may also be customized to use a liquid disinfectant spray and a scrubber to help hospital personnel decrease their exposure to the virus. 
“For me, as a robotics researcher, I always feel like the best use case of robots is in the application areas where it’s risky for humans,” said Al-Hussaini, a doctorate student studying computer science. “When [the coronavirus] came up, that’s the first thing I thought about … How can we make the workspace safer while not endangering other people?” 
The CAM team continues to test its robot with the hope that it can be a tool to alleviate other coronavirus-induced problems aside from those healthcare workers are facing. 
“Not only does it save and protect humans, but it also gives certain people jobs back. That’s the vision for this,” Thakar said.

USC students who do not qualify for federal loan or grant funding will be barred from accessing federal emergency funds as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act’s Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund meant to aid students who are facing hardship as a result of the pandemic, according to a new set of guidelines released by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. 
The University has been given $19.3 million of the $6.3 billion allocated to colleges and universities by the stimulus package approved by President Donald Trump last month. Of the $9.6 million of its funds mandated for students, none will be able to go toward students who have had prior drug convictions, did not meet satisfactory academic progress or are considered international, online, part-time or undocumented. 
USC administrators instead are redirecting students who do not qualify for funding to the USC Student Basic Needs Emergency Relief Fund for which all currently enrolled part-time and full-time undergraduate and graduate students are eligible. 
“This fund is available for students experiencing financial difficulties that jeopardize their success or continued enrollment at USC, and who have exhausted all other resources,” USC’s frequently asked questions page regarding the CARES Act read. “Examples may include, but are not limited to, dental/medical costs, housing costs and unexpected loss of employment.”
Only Title IV eligible students, as indicated by the Higher Education Act of 1965, may receive emergency financial aid grants, according to the new federal guidelines. Students who have filed or can file a FAFSA qualify for the grant.
“The criteria to participate in programs under Section 484 of the HEA include but are not limited to the following: U.S. citizenship or eligible noncitizen; a valid Social Security number; registration with Selective Service (if the student is male); and a high school diploma, GED, or completion of high school in an approved homeschool setting,” the new guidelines stated.
The CARES Act will be directed toward providing emergency grants for housing, food, course materials, health care and child care for students who have been affected by the pandemic. Funding will be coordinated by the Financial Aid Office, in cooperation with Student Affairs and Campus Support and Intervention, once USC receives funding from the Department of Education. 
“USC is grateful for the funds we received from the CARES Act,” the University said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “We desperately need these emergency funds and will drive 100% of them toward supporting our students who are experiencing financial hardships. Our goal is to assist as many students and families as possible in meeting their financial demands during this disruptive time.”
USC is encouraging eligible students to apply and provide documentation by May 1 due to limited funding available from the CARES Act. The maximum award is $3,000 and will not affect students’ financial aid package. 
“The total funds available are limited,” the FAQ page read. “The university’s priority is to help as many students as possible, especially those in greatest need, get through this academic year.” 
For those who apply to the USC Student Basic Needs Emergency Relief Fund, the maximum award is $750. Students can receive the grant once per semester. Students can apply via email to set up a Zoom meeting to discuss qualifications and will receive a notification of their approval within two weeks. Funds will be disbursed to students’ accounts. 
Aside from the new guidelines, the CARES Act does not stipulate how much money should be set aside per student, although it requires 50% of the money allocated to each university to go toward emergency student aid related to campus disruption, according to DeVos’ letter to university presidents earlier this month. The letter also proposed using the maximum federal Pell Grant funding, approximately $6,000, as the maximum funding each student may receive.
“The CARES Act provides institutions with significant discretion on how to award this emergency assistance to students,” the letter stated. “This means that each institution may develop its own system and process for determining how to allocate these funds, which may include distributing the funds to all students or only to students who demonstrate significant need.”
School allocations from the CARES Act were determined by a set formula that took into heavy consideration the number of full-time students who are Pell Grant-eligible. The calculation also took into account the size of the student body, including those who were not enrolled full-time before the pandemic.
Students who are eligible for funding through the University’s Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund grant are encouraged to apply to it as a primary resource, using the USC Student Basic Needs Emergency Relief Fund and other services when all other funds are exhausted. 
Departments and schools have also established their own emergency aid for students, such as the Marshall Student Emergency Aid Fund and the Graduate Student Government Emergency Fund Program. These funds will be distributed in consideration of students’ existing financial aid, although the University said it will work to preserve preexisting sources of financial aid. Students who receive departmental or school funding are still eligible for the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund though they will not receive funding for the same expenses more than once.
According to the website, USC is currently reviewing Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund applications as quickly as possible to process students’ applications and allocate funding. Students are encouraged to check the Financial Aid Summary and Tasks page in their account for additional document requests. Students will receive an email when their application is processed. If funding is approved, grants will be disbursed to students’ accounts through eRefund on USCe.pay.

As USC continues to adjust to the economic impacts stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, it has adjusted or paused some sustainability initiatives. Students, faculty and staff acknowledged the halt in progress along with the survival of environmentally friendly initiatives at Wednesday’s Spring Sustainability Forum hosted virtually as part of the USC Office of Sustainability’s Earth Day celebration.
The 2019-20 academic year was filled with numerous environmental accomplishments, Office of Sustainability Associate Director Ellen Dux said. However, attendees noted the reality that many initiatives, including the Divest SC campaign and the Sustainability 2028 Plan, have had to halt as USCshifts gears to address coronavirus impacts, including switching to virtual learning and allocating funds for students and community members in need. 
Since late January, students have been working with USC administrators to discourage investment of $277 million in the fossil fuel industry from the University’s $5.5 billion endowment, with a goal to shift the endowment to reinvestment in renewable energies. The Sustainability 2028 Plan looked to continue many of its 2020 Plan initiatives and also includes aggressive sustainability goals, including achieving a carbon neutral campus by 2028 and a zero waste campus by 2022. With the University’s focus on responding to coronavirus impacts on campus, meetings regarding these initiatives have stopped for the time being. 
In an opening speech, President Carol Folt said that although the outbreak has caused unprecedented challenges, she commended the collaborative nature of many USC students and groups as they continue to strive for sustainable change and push for new environmentally friendly initiatives on campus, such as the approval of Meatless Mondays to dining halls. 
“It’s about making ourselves leaders or leading for the things we believe in, in sustainability and climate change,” Folt said. “Every single part of the institution has people in it who have wanted to be a part of [sustainability change] and already have been so instrumental in pushing things faster just in eight months than we might have believed possible.”
The divestment campaign started by the Environmental Student Assembly, Environmental Core and Undergraduate and Graduate Student governments through their Divest SC rally in January is currently on hold. However, ESA co-director Nathaniel Hyman told the Daily Trojan the campaign will continue once students return to campus. 
“We’re gonna eventually recover from this and we’re going to decide, ‘Where do we invest our endowments?’ and I hope ESA is there to say that it better not be in fossil fuels,” Hyman said. “If you unload assets at the moment, that can hurt pensions, that could hurt our financial aid and we’re not trying to punish students or workers to achieve that at a time where the damage we’d be doing wouldn’t compare to what’s happening through [this] financial crisis.”
The Sustainability 2028 Plan has also been placed on hold. With planning starting last July, the committee looked to present its Sustainability 2028 Plan proposal to senior management in April. Even with the spread of the coronavirus placing the plan six weeks behind schedule, Dux said the committee is looking to continue where they left off in a meeting with the chief financial officer May 1. They will continue to discuss costs of future initiatives, including transitioning to a zero waste campus by 2022.
“We don’t have an expectation that sustainability is off the table; we do understand that our timeline has shifted but it’s still a priority, it’s still a focus,” Dux told attendees. “We’re still planning on having a plan launching in January and we will keep everybody up to speed as we get more clarity — when people can sort of take a focus back off of emergency and back into next-to-normal and what that’s going to look like.” 
Student innovators have also been affected by the spread of the coronavirus, including the creators of sustainability-focused companies Infinity Boxx, Cirqular and Project Wren. Ben Stanfield, 2019 alumnus and co-founder of Project Wren, a startup aimed at offsetting customers’ carbon footprint, said that although the business has seen slower traffic on its website, his team has moved to provide helpful resources for customers during the pandemic. 
“[Project Wren] is going to focus on building more tools that help improve accessibility for [customers], providing the tools and resources [and] expanding our offering, so non-paying customers have their own profile pages, more social elements of Wren,” Stanfield told the Daily Trojan. “This is all stuff we were already planning on doing, but COVID has accelerated the rate at which we’re actually pushing out those features.”
Although these and other sustainability projects are on hold, some initiatives have continued to make progress. 
The Sustainability 2020 Plan has met most of its goals, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions on campus by 33% and a decrease in the number of single-occupancy vehicles traveling around campus, with carpools increasing from 6-10%. 
Meatless Mondays, spearheaded by ESA’s director of advocacy Ben Cho, was also approved by USC Residential Dining in April and will begin in the fall. 
The Presidential Sustainability Working Group and USG have also helped implement new general education sustainability courses for Spring 2021 and have recommended to senior administrators to hire a chief sustainability officer who will directly advise the President in decisions regarding sustainability. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, USG President Truman Fritz said with the economic impacts the coronavirus will potentially make on the University, he is concerned USG may slow down ongoing environmental initiatives. 
“My fear is that it will probably set back some sustainability initiatives, but I do continue to believe that the situation will get better, and we will still have sustainability at the forefront of our thinking when we are going into the next few years,” Fritz said. 
Despite challenges faced by the pandemic, Dux said projects reported by speakers during the virtual celebration show the achievements in sustainability that groups have made on campus in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
“[Having] everybody talk about what they’ve been doing … until now and see it all in one place and you’re really struck by how much everybody has accomplished this year, the student groups in particular,” Dux said. “It’s phenomenal.”

I remember the flight attendant approaching me with a tray of steaming beverages immediately after crossing into American territory. “How would you like your privilege served today?” 
The only thing that America is perhaps better at than discussing privilege is parading its own. Without letting this hypocrisy escape us, discussing one’s privilege is a good thing. The in-your-face approach to doing so is highly commendable and leads to much needed introspection. 
Every country and person in the world should have the education and understanding of privilege, as well as the ability to question and discuss it as thoroughly as some Americans do. It is a lens that has successfully pushed forward social change, fueling some of the most impressive movements for social justice the world has seen, from women’s liberation to civil rights to LGBTQ+ pride. Everyone should be well-versed on the ins and outs of deconstructing privilege. 
However, America is not perfect in its deconstruction — at least not anymore. There is something markedly vicious about the hostility with which privilege is currently often discussed in the United States. An accusatory tone stews division between people where consensus might have otherwise been attained.
To this day I am unsure at what point a society that champions individuality turned into one that picks apart every way people might be different from each other and then pits them one against the other. But labeling people and dividing them into groups seem to be deeply ingrained parts of America’s “I” culture. Within such a culture, it seems the ability for people to work together is often lost through unnecessary aggression and accusatory rhetoric. People become so caught up with obsessing over the trespasses of others that they forget to keep their own in check. 
This, of course, goes way beyond talking about privilege. But it nonetheless has left its imprint in privilege talk as well. 
In my experience living in the United States, I have found a recurring myth that privilege is zero sum; and a tendency to forget that privilege is always relative. I believe both of these inform themselves of notions of individuality. Taking a more holistic approach to understanding society as a whole helps deconstruct it. 
Privilege is not a zero-sum game. Nobody owns all the privilege in the world, although some people without a doubt feel entitled to a much larger portion than is fair. That being said, it is important to understand we all hold privileged and unprivileged positions in different aspects of our own life. And the wonderful thing is realizing this not only helps us relate to each other’s vulnerabilities but also allows us to understand that bringing together our differences can make us all stronger. We might be surprised to find a broad range of unlikely allies who can share in the superordinate goal of improving everyone’s life.
If we reflect on the positions of advantage we do hold, it is easy to realize we can be immensely ignorant about the struggles others might face. On both sides of the coin, on which we will all inevitably be in different situations and interactions, it is important to remain empathetic and willing to help.
Privilege is also relative. For example, the most underprivileged citizen living freely in a first-world society is much more privileged than their counterparts in autocratic nations, developing nations or warring nations across the world. Poverty can mean job insecurity in one nation and food insecurity in another. 
No matter how privileged or underprivileged one might be, there is always so much one has to be thankful for. Life is a gift that should never be taken for granted; neither should be the arbitrary luck one might have had at birth. Even if it might seem worse than that of others, countless more would give anything to have it. 
With privilege should come accountability, and we should all spend at least three times as much time looking down toward helping those below us as we do looking up with spite. There will always be someone above and someone below, and in some bizarre way, it is all interconnected. Challenging the status quo and changing privilege should never be a solitary endeavor. It shouldn’t be about moving one’s individual link forward but about moving all to a better place.
It is important for everyone to be aware of the privileged positions we have been given, to be thankful for them and never take them for granted; understanding others, through no fault of their own, might not have had the same luck. Change should be a holistic and humble process, based on gratefulness for what we do have and an understanding that we must work together to get that which we do not. While one voice might be strong, it is nothing without the chorus of voices willing to back it up. While individualism is great for pointing out the work that needs to be done, it is only by coming together that it can be accomplished.

“It’s just a preference.”
In the romantic world, this phrase is commonplace, be it in reference to height, weight, hair color, etc. However, “just a preference” tends to be the company line when it comes to race. It’s a justification all people of color have heard or will hear at some point in the dating space. On a campus that touts diversity, it’s interesting how averse to diversity many students may be when it comes to who they choose to couple up with.
In a dream world, this wouldn’t be the case, yet everyone has preferences when it comes to choosing a partner. Some want tall, muscular, slim, blonde, tan, rich, smart and any other combination of arbitrary features. Who is anyone to cast the first stone? Some may prefer oranges over apples or the beach over skiing. 
It’s not “problematic” on the surface level to have a preference for anything. But where these preferences come from is often neglected. All preferences come from somewhere — they don’t build themselves, and it’s important to question where they originate. Racial preferences — and this is surprising — usually stem from racism. 
Students are quick to claim that they are progressive, and that’s probably true. But all have schemas that come from years and years of conditioning and information absorbed from the media; bombardment with imagery informs sexual and social attitudes daily. Twitter celebrates its “White Boy of the Month” annually, a product of years and years of white leads dominating film and TV. American attitudes are informed by tropes that are as old as the country itself. 
World War II produced a wave of anti-Asian propaganda that sought to emasculate and desexualize Asian men through caricature — a trend that persists through film and TV. The image of the “dominant Black savage” was born with this nation and is ingrained in films still regarded as classics, such as “Gone With the Wind.” It’s not a coincidence that Asian men and Black women consistently have the least success with online dating, as found in a 2014 study conducted by OKCupid. 
Black men are often met with a similar situation on Grindr and other gay dating apps, where they are likely to face either gross fetishization or immediate dismissal. When people think about who they want to date or even just spend a night with, many don’t consciously recall propaganda and racism as the reason for aversion to certain types of people. They might not even think of themselves as averse — they’re open to anything — but the reality is that everyone leans a certain way, and it’s not for nothing. Races have been coded, and people have been conditioned to buy into these codes, no matter how arbitrary and false.
It’s also hard to pursue diversity in dating when not confronted with diversity in everyday life on campus. It’s not a matter of seeking it out; it’s expected to just come to students. Oftentimes, it doesn’t.
While USC is a large campus that houses people of all backgrounds, diversity often feels like something students have to look for. It isn’t as easy to find as it is depicted in the welcome brochures. It’s not hard to enter certain spaces and think “Oh, there’s one type of person here.” 
The textbook example of this is Greek Row, a “Chad’s paradise” and the site of viral videos of blonde girls excitedly opening envelopes. It’s not a secret that wealthy, white students primarily occupy Greek life. However, to point to Greek life as the only example of homogeneity in student life is quite the misnomer. It’s an oversight because many student organizations are the same way, it’s just not as readily noticeable. 
This is not to argue that USC is segregated, just that many of the student organizations have become more demographically uniform than they ought to be. This means USC students aren’t as easily exposed to people of other backgrounds in substantive ways as they would expect.
It’s easy to look at academia as a universal solution. Ignoring preexisting societal structures outside of anyone’s direct control, the classroom is an equal-opportunity space. However, students are primarily in class to learn and may not be so focused on the people around them; exchanging with others is rarely a must and often begins and ends in the lecture hall, base and unsubstantial. 
However, when the company that students are choosing to keep — for reasons social, professional or otherwise — begins to look homogenous, it’s a problem that affects how they think. People don’t recognize the exclusion problem in who they’re dating when that exclusion and homogeneity become the norm in all other spheres, namely the clubs and organizations students join on campus.
It’s also naive to assume this is a problem that can be corrected overnight. People will always have preferences — everyone will. But it’s important to reevaluate them, to recontextualize the schemas the brain automatically creates and ask why feelings are held about certain types of people. If the answer isn’t something that would be appropriately shared aloud, then it’s likely best to act against it. 
This takes time. 
At their worst, “preferences” are backward and vile; but at their best, they’re tragic barriers in the way of great and unique opportunity. With a little effort, all barriers can be kicked down: First comes the recognition that they exist.

On April 13, ABC released the first episode of its new reality dating show, “Listen to Your Heart,” a spinoff of “The Bachelor.” ABC already has a number of other shows in its “Bachelor” franchise, including “The Bachelorette,” “Bachelor in Paradise” and “Bachelor Winter Games.” But this show adds a new twist into the mix: music.
The show consists of 23 single musicians; 12 men and 11 women live together and go on dates in hopes of finding their musical and romantic match. While this show might seem innovative, after watching the first two episodes, it is safe to say that “Listen to Your Heart” is nothing more than a derivative of “The Bachelor” that accentuates the unrealistic portions of reality dating shows.
Just like every other season of “The Bachelor,” the show’s contestants are all in pursuit of an elusive fairytale romance. The contestants are all extremely attractive, young and ready to “find love” with partners who share similar interests and career goals. The contestants share a fantasy that revolves around having the perfect romantic partner with whom they could make music. 
“Listen to Your Heart” also appeals to “The Bachelor” audience’s craving for competition and conflict. However, contestants vying for each other’s hearts is not the only aspect of competition in this spinoff. The show also adds a Disney-like musical aspect where the contestants are supposed to compete for love through their singing and musical performance as well.
Since the show is still in its early days, the plot has not fully developed, but viewers can expect some fights, gossip and beef to emerge in later episodes. As we learned on this past season of “The Bachelor,” things do not go well when all the contestants have to live under the same roof. 
Like “The Bachelor,” “Listen to Your Heart” puts pressure on the contestants to quickly find romantic connections, which leads to many hasty, rather questionable decisions. On the first night, the contestants felt the need to rush their relationships and be overly assertive or else face elimination. 
One contestant who faced consequences as a result of her early advances was Jamie Gabrielle. Within the first couple hours of meeting everyone, Gabrielle put herself in a rough situation by choosing to make out with not one but two other contestants. She ended the night in tears, already feeling conflicted. 
While these issues are quite obvious, “Listen to Your Heart” is also terrible for a number of other reasons. The show assumes that by singing and playing music together, contestants will be able to find a deeper connection and build a legitimate romantic relationship with each other. Not only that, the so-called “connection” and “passion” between contestants are supposed to be measured by others who get to judge them. 
A combination of both real musical artists and former “Bachelor” contestants serve as judges to assess the contestants’ chemistry and musical talent. As the contestants’ relationship through music is critiqued by musicians and “Bachelor” alumni, these judges may get the wrong idea about contestants’ individual situations and feelings toward each other, negatively influencing desired outcomes.
While the concept of using music to find love is intriguing, these assumptions are completely false and superficial. Just because a couple is not musically compatible does not mean their relationship will fail. 
Ultimately, “Listen to Your Heart” presents a facade of contestants truly being able to find love on a reality dating show. Being able to perform well together and appear like a match made in music heaven is completely different from actually building a harmonious relationship with a significant other.
For all these reasons, and maybe even more, “Listen to Your Heart” is clearly just another trashy spinoff of “The Bachelor” that the network is using to keep its viewers engaged. The show attempts to present a refreshing concept, but a closer look at the actual workings of the show reveals that it is no different from any other variation of “The Bachelor.” The format of the show leads to shallow relationships that are more than likely to end in disappointing breakups, proving that the fantasy of “The Bachelor” franchise is no more than a mirage.

Picture this: It’s an early morning at the beach in sunny Southern California. Surfboard in hand, you soak in the golden hour sunlight and listen to the even beat of the waves crashing onto the shore as you paddle out into the surf. That’s the vibe that Jacob DeGuzman, whose stage name is Guspy, hopes to evoke through his music. 
A sophomore majoring in business administration, Guspy’s musical style draws inspiration from jazz and reggae, with distinct undertones of late ’60s rock and indie-pop. His relaxed melodies feel like laying on the sand and basking in the sunshine, while psychedelic beats give the listener an added hallucinatory experience. 
At 14, Guspy’s father took him to a Dick Dale concert. Around the same time, his friends introduced him to the White Stripes. After watching Dale perform and listening to White Stripes records on repeat, Guspy knew he wanted to make his own music. 
“[Seeing Dale play] was just one of the craziest things ever,” Guspy said. “I don’t know, something about … Jack White and Dick Dale … shredding the guitar just [made me think] I really want to do that.”
In eighth grade, Guspy taught himself how to play guitar, the drums and has also since taught himself how to produce music using GarageBand. Due to his lack of formal music education, Guspy can’t properly read sheet music. TJ Wee, one of his friends and musical collaborators at USC and a junior majoring in music production, believes that his unconventional approach to music has allowed him to be fearless in experimenting with his craft.
“[Guspy has] definitely taught me to be a little bit less analytical and critical, and just go by what feels good, and what feels right,” Wee said. “He’s really good at doing that.”
In addition to writing and producing three full solo albums while in high school, “Guspy,” “River Styx” and “Pilgrim,” all of which are available on Soundcloud, Guspy played in a band that performed at the House of Blues in Anaheim to an audience of over 70 people. For Guspy, it was at this point when he realized that music was exactly what he wanted to pursue.
“I was just like, ‘I want to do this forever. And why not? I’m pretty good at this,’” Guspy said. “But coming to college and seeing how it really works, it is a lot of luck. But it’s also a lot of being smart about what you’re doing.”
At first, Guspy admitted that it was hard to be taken seriously as a musician at USC without being in the Thornton School of Music. However, he doesn’t feel wholly disadvantaged because of this, as his courses in the Marshall School of Business teach him other essential skills, such as networking and building relationships. 
“I think business best suits me because I learned music all untraditionally,” Guspy said. “I don’t think learning that stuff in a classroom would have benefited me. I’m glad I can learn other skills, like how to make money off the music because that’s one thing I didn’t know how to do.”
Guspy released the single “Hesh Girl” at the end of his first year at USC on Spotify, SoundCloud and Apple Music — a song based on an inside joke that he and his friends had about a girl living in their dorm. After the release of this song, he realized that he was finally taken seriously as an artist by fellow student musicians. Forming a live band and performing live shows was another step in being acknowledged. 
Kane Acosta, a junior majoring in music industry, met Guspy during fraternity formal recruitment. He was drawn to Guspy because of their similar interests and music tastes and took Guspy under his wing. As a mentor, Acosta pushed for Guspy to add a minor in music industry. 
“I pushed really hard for him to be a music industry minor and then through that, he was able to develop a mindset and start pushing his business aspects towards music,” Acosta said. “[Being a mentor] it’s not like you teach somebody something. You just set a bunch of parameters and expose them and they just grow with that on their own.”
Guspy’s music is currently available on SoundCloud. Wanting a clean slate, he has taken his music down from Spotify and Apple Music to focus on rebranding. This process includes polishing old songs with the help of a producer and an audio engineer in order to elevate his music to the next level. Guspy said it is a slow and calculated process, but he is dedicated to releasing the best possible music.
“If I want to take it seriously … I should put in that extra 1% to just really hone it in because it takes one song eventually to really make a name,” Guspy said. “So [I] might as well put everything into every song.” 
Guspy is inspired by a number of artists, ranging from the way they create their music to their cultural background. As an artist who composes and produces all of his own music, Tame Impala and Mac DeMarco serve as continued inspirations for Guspy. With cultural ties to Mexico and the Philippines, he admires artists such as Omar Apollo, an American artist born to Mexican parents, and the Spanish-influenced band, The Growlers. 
“I see myself fitting with [those artists],” Guspy said. “In a music sense, not exactly, but definitely in terms of identity and culture.”
Guspy’s grandparents worked hard to create a life for him in America. For that reason, he feels an obligation to represent his culture in the music industry and take advantage of all of the opportunities they fought to give him.
“I want to give back to the community in a sense, and have more representation,” Guspy said. “My grandparents … sacrificed a lot to get their families here. So it is now my job to take the most of the opportunities available and mimic and replicate their hard work that they did to get here so that I could be successful.”
Guspy is scheduled to perform at YOON FEST July 17 to 18 in the Mojave Desert. In addition, he has a big release on Spotify coming soon.

In January, when I was thinking about my column topic for the upcoming semester, I was debating between various ideas. I considered focusing on young athletes in professional leagues to highlight a sports year with drastic changes to league rules and playoff formats. But when I realized that this was supposed to be a Summer Olympics year, I knew I wanted to write about my thoughts on the 2020 Olympics and the Games in general. 
Unlike the other topics my colleagues at the Daily Trojan write about, I thought mine would only be relevant every other year. And even then, the premises would be different, as each Winter and Summer Olympics has its own set of storylines attached.
Since my column was purely based on an event that would no longer be happening in the upcoming months, I was at a crossroads — conflicted about what more there would be to write about — but I ultimately chose to focus on the International Olympic Committee’s postponement decision and some of my favorite Olympic moments.
Since this is my last column of the semester, I thought it would be a good idea to reintroduce points I’ve brought up in previous columns to focus on what we can all learn from the postponement. 
The Olympics has a long-standing tradition dating back to the ancient eighth century BCE. The modern Olympic Games date back to the 1896 Olympics in Athens. Since the modern Games’ inception in the 19th century, however, the last time the Olympics were canceled or postponed was in 1944 due to World War II. The rarity of such a drastic occurrence from even happening in the first place shows how serious this year’s postponement really is.
Since then, the Olympics has grown to host 33 sports and more than 11,000 athletes.
To no surprise, many people — myself included — were crushed to hear that the Olympics were postponed. I remember watching the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games and seeing the ceremony introducing the Tokyo Olympics logo at the end. I was so excited for this year to host another great lineup of legendary athletes.
But as I kept seeing news of the coronavirus spreading to Japan and then the United States, I knew it was an inevitable fate: On March 24, the world received the news that the Olympics would officially be postponed, if not canceled.
At first, I didn’t know how to react — well past the trivial concern for my column, I was concerned for the millions of fans who had already bought tickets and hotel reservations, for the more than 6,000 athletes who had qualified, for the millions of Summer Olympics enthusiasts who have waited impatiently for four years to witness what is arguably the most important and prestigious sporting event.
As the days passed, the IOC released its decision to move the Games to 2021. The logo would remain the same, and the athletes who had already qualified would still be able to compete.
This was not a cancellation; rather, it was a mere postponement to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone involved with the Olympics.
As disappointed as I was, the decision made me realize just how obsessive and dedicated people like myself can get when it comes to sports. People care so much about sports that it can consume their lives. 
But there is so much more to a person’s happiness than winning. Isn’t the health and well-being of your friends and family more important than cheering on a last-second push to the finish line?
Postponing the Olympics may have led many people to feel distraught and frustrated, but there comes a time when the cliche “it’s just a game” really starts to present itself in people’s lives.
The IOC made the right decision in moving the Olympics. The health of fans and athletes should take precedence over anything, and I am glad the IOC realized that. 
I hope this makes all sports fans realize the importance of putting health and safety above all else. Then, when it is the right time for the Olympics to return, sports will bring everyone together again. 
It has become a tradition for people to get excited about the largest sporting event in the world every four years. People intentionally took two weeks out of their summer to watch sprinter Usain Bolt beat record after record and see swimmer Michael Phelps become the all-time Olympic medal-holder.
Moments like these are what make sports special and what make the Olympics unique unlike anything else. People live for Olympic moments because that is what sports does: It creates a community and mutual appreciation for fans and athletes alike.
That is why the Olympics are so legendary. Not only because the best athletes from around the world gather to compete, but because it brings together entire generations and people from more than 200 countries to strive for the same goal: Going for Gold.
