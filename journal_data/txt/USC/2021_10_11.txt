According to the Los Angeles Times, Head Swim Coach Jeremy Kipp was placed on administrative leave. The decision comes after concerns arose surrounding abusive treatment of swimmers in the program.
The players were told Friday that Kipp would be placed on leave. The team will begin its first invitational of the season Friday guided by former assistant coach Lea Maurer, who will step in as interim head coach. Maurer was a gold and bronze medalist in the 1992 Summer Olympics and formerly coached Stanford’s women’s swim and dive.
As to the nature of the University’s concerns, the specifics of the abuse allegations remain unknown. SwimSwam.com, an online publication that provides coverage of competitive swimming, reported an incident in April 2021 in which Kipp allegedly kicked a water bottle that subsequently hit a swimmer in the face. USC launched an investigation into the incident, but  did not confirm whether the incident or other details influenced the decision to put Kipp on leave.  
“The well-being of our student-athletes is our top priority,” wrote the University in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “When a concern is raised about a coach or staff member, the University takes it seriously and looks into it.”
USC Athletic Director Mike Bohn hired Kipp in May 2020 to replace long-time swim coach Dave Salo, who retired in January 2020. Kipp previously coached at Northwestern and Boise State prior to his tenure as USC head coach. Kipp also served as an assistant coach to Salo from 2008 to 2015. 
In his first season as head coach, Kipp’s women’s team finished fourth out of seven teams at the Pac-12 championships, and his men’s team placed fifth out of five teams.

“Dying was my biggest blessing because it showed me how precious life is,” said Moakeah Rivera, a muralist and junior majoring in anthropology.
When Rivera experienced a brush with death, she relied on her childhood love for art to resuscitate her back to life. 
Rivera grew up with artists in her family and was exposed to a variety of art at a young age. 
“I grew up a lot with Indigenous art, meaning my parents did want me to be exposed to museums and they wanted me to take all that in,” Rivera said. “But my father in particular put more reassurance on different kinds of art. He’d take me to Mexico, and we’d visit different kinds of museums.”
Her family trips consisted of visiting Oaxaca, Mexico, a special place for Rivera. Oaxaca became the haven where her family resettled after the California bounty hunt for Native Americans. Here, Rivera discovered Frida Kahlo’s work, a prominent Mexican painter, whose work cultivated up to cultural icon status for her use of energetic colors in her self-portraits.
Rivera’s passion and interest in murals only augmented after her family members showed her the possibilities of life as an artist.
“One of my uncles is actually a professional artist, so he always talked to me about art as if it were not rather a job but an actual lifestyle,” Rivera said. 
Mural artwork was an almost accidental blessing for Rivera, who hadn’t done mural art until her senior year in high school. While muraling for Rivera is an expression of her artistic side, she always views murals as a platform for a greater message: activism. 
“My art is very realist. It’s a lot of realism. I tend to just paint what I see,” Rivera said. “Even through art, I was able to find a lot of activism.” 
Jetsy Fernandez, Rivera’s friend and a junior majoring in public relations, said Rivera’s openness and energetic personality shines through her work and beyond. 
“There is some energy about her that makes you happy, she is such a happy person … she is so open and welcoming,” Fernandez said. “Whatever she does, she does it with pure intentions and dedication … she wants to explore everything and bring awareness and just show everyone art in all different forms.” 
As an Indigenous woman, Rivera has reckoned with the dark realities of racial injustice and inequalities that have plagued her heritage for generations. She has experienced the sexual fetishism some associate with her ethnic background. 
“My first mural was about missing murdered Indigenous woman and the sexualization of the Indigenous women, because I was the only Native American woman in my high school,” Rivera said. “And yet I was always called exotic, and I was always sexualized.”
Rivera uses her mural art as a form of peaceful political expression to call attention to the mistreatment of women in her culture. To combat the misconceived notions about her heritage, Rivera used her first mural to send a clear message: Freedom. 
Lucy Jordan, a senior majoring in public relations, recalls how she felt empowered after seeing one of Rivera’s art pieces in high school. 
“She cares so much about other people and she shows that through her artwork. She uses her artwork to empower other women as well,” Jordan said. “It makes me feel really good about myself, and I can always tell there is so much dedication put into it as well.” 
Each aspect of Rivera’s art is thoroughly analyzed to portray a personal story. Each brush stroke carries detailed intention to paint the full story. The use of eye-catching colors and specific brush techniques all come together to symbolize the process of her activism through art. 
“To describe my first mural: It was a Native woman who was a tree. She was growing from the ground. Her arms were out and she crossed her chest and said, ‘Believe me.’ There were hummingbirds on the sides, representing freedom,” Rivera said. “As an Indigenous woman, it has been one of the only ways I’ve been able to express myself without seeing retaliation.” 
During the stillness of the night, Rivera stands, unchallenged and determined, the movement of her brilliant strokes of vibrant colors covering over the red-brick walls. Her bright paint is often the only source of color filling the dark alleyways. While she enjoys painting out her visions, getting commissioned for each of her mural pieces comes with its highs and lows.
“It’s stressful, I never know what kind of wall I’m gonna encounter next,” Rivera said. “It’s always a good challenge because I’m always still learning, but muraling, it’s like a perfect median because I always found it hard to do small canvas work because I felt there wasn’t enough I could show, but with muraling, you can tell an entire story.” 
A mural typically takes three full nights to complete, but during those three days are when she feels the most alive.
“I see myself using art as a coping mechanism now and as a form of survival,” Rivera said. “ My commission work is basically the only work I have that I can like to have for myself because I do so much for my family. It’s not just an option for me. It’s a part of survival.”
A part of survival is no understatement, when last December, Rivera found herself in the hospital flatlining. 
“I have heart disease, and my condition is so rare that there’s really no funding, no research in it,” Rivera said. “My mom had estimated I had about like five to 10 minutes left to the point they couldn’t resuscitate me. By the time we had gotten to the hospital, I had no heartbeat at all. I was completely unconscious. I had died. I had literally flatlined.” 
Through her near brush with death, her love and appreciation of art only deepened. Oftentimes, holding the paintbrush in hand was the only escape, providing a sense of healing. 
“When I came back to life, that’s when I realized that my greatest blessing is not remembering,” Rivera said. “I had to learn about who I was prior, and my art really showed me who I was.”
Now, Rivera is working on a new mural that is set to be displayed on the third floor of USC’s Student Union building, in hopes to send a message of empowerment to other Indigenous students at USC.

As students trickle in for the Native American Student Assembly’s meeting on a regular Wednesday evening, the group gathers for another round of “sweet grass and snake bite,” where members share a good and bad thing about their week. 
However, in a sea of birthday parties, brutal exams, family visits and clumsy mishaps, one sweet grass and snake bite looms over. 
Snake bite: In lieu of its large student body, less than 1% of students who attend USC are Native American. 
Sweet grass: Native American students can rely on NASA for community and a proper safe space.
NASA, previously known as the Native American Student Union, was founded in 2017. During this time, NASU operated under the religious center because the assembly lacked the space and resources necessary to establish itself as a cohesive organization. It wasn’t until 2020 that NASA became what it is today. 
Extreme efforts were made last year for NASU to receive recognition from the Undergraduate Student Government.
“Before us, USG was very much geared towards groups that have a lot of representation and a lot of presence on campus, which is understandable because the student government is there to represent the students,” said Maracea “Mesa” Chase, executive director and co-founder of NASA. “However, it felt like a space that was specifically made for underrepresented groups to not succeed.” 
Each year, USG allocates a budget to multiple organizations on campus. With their recognition, the assembly could expand and have access to more resources, carrying out more events and activities. 
A petition was made to fight for NASA’s spot on USG, and the organization went through a long and strenuous process of getting enough signatures to properly be considered. 
“[It] was a really big effort and a lot of very kind people helped us with that transition and helped us get into student government,” Chase said. 
Eventually, their hard work paid off, with the organization becoming a USG-recognized organization in the beginning of last year. NASU officially changed to NASA, and the organization became hopeful for what was to come, as it now had the resources to do the work it always wanted to do. 
But, after its integration into USG, NASA was left to tackle an even bigger hurdle, one that was completely out of the University’s control — a global pandemic. 
The progress NASA made quickly halted, as schools across the country scrambled to transition to an online setting. The coronavirus affected everyone, and NASA was no exception to this. 
Figuring out how to navigate that space was very much a struggle, according to students. 
“It was definitely a learning adjustment. Like many other student groups on campus, it was hard to get new students involved,” Chase said.  “Even though it would seem like being on an online space, it would be easy to reach out to people, I think the lack of being in-person made a lot of things intimidating.”
Despite these circumstances, Chase said members of NASA were still able to support each other and offer community and explained how these hard circumstances allowed them to connect like never before. 
“Even though we weren’t necessarily doing really big events, it still very much felt like a very supportive and thriving community,” Chase said. 
NASA’s members come from a variety of different backgrounds and origin stories. Some spent their entire lives growing up on a Native American reservation, while others found themselves dismantling the assimilation their families were forced to go through. 
Her mom, being a part of the Navajo tribe, and her dad, a member of the Hopi and Lakota Sioux tribe — both growing up on reservations — knew they wanted to provide their children with the same experience. 
Chase is grateful that she was able to have the opportunity to be surrounded by a community that was constantly rooting for her.  
“There is nothing like being able to connect with your community in a way that I have had the privilege to be able to,” Chase said. “Just being able to be surrounded by people who are so very genuinely rooting for you, who are there to always provide food, shelter, give you some advice, help you learn more about your culture or speak your language with you. It’s just very close to my heart.”
Coming to USC, Chase found it difficult adjusting to a space where she wasn’t fully surrounded by people who looked and spoke the same language as her. 
“My big thing about NASA as a whole is very much pushing community for those who want to learn more or who identify as Native American,” Chase said. “Having no one to talk to, that very much is a detrimental thing. So, my priority is being able to create that community for people [and] increasing visibility of our community and our native and indigenous voices and uplifting them is amazing.”
As executive director, Chase takes her role seriously, supporting NASA members by advocating for their issues and being a person to lean on for support.
“My whole thing about coming to college and pursuing a higher education is to support my people, and support those stories and perspectives because they matter; they make a difference,” Chase said.  
However, students like Raegan Kirby, NASA secretary and member of the Ojibwe Chippewa tribe, had quite a different experience. 
Kirby grew up in Orange County, Calif., yet a majority of her extended family lives in Missouri or Michigan, choosing to distance themselves from their Native American heritage and assimilate into American culture. Kirby and her cousins are the ones who have really taken it upon themselves to reclaim their native roots. 
Growing up, her great grandfather was the Chief of her family’s tribe and had the opportunity to name all his grandchildren Native names, giving Kirby the name of “Little Rock.” 
“Growing up, I told everyone that I knew that I was Native American,” Kirby said. “Whenever we did talk about it in elementary school, I’d be so excited and tell everyone everything that I knew.”
Despite being immersed in the culture as a child, Kirby was faced with other challenges. Having a white complexion, she was often told by others that she didn’t “look” Native American . 
Even with her exposure to her Native roots, as she grew older, Kirby found herself suppressing that part of her identity. 
“I felt like I didn’t have the initiative to talk on native issues and be proud of my heritage anymore because of my white privilege,” Kirby said. “I was just not one to speak on certain things. Of course, I would speak up here and there when I had the chance, but it wasn’t something I was outwardly prideful about.”
She slowly stopped wearing accessories that represented her culture, and the joy she felt as a kid from being Native American diminished. It wasn’t until fairly recently she rediscovered the pride she once felt. 
“I would say it was my senior year of high school that I started reclaiming that part of my identity, when I started learning that a lot of other Natives were going through the same thing as me,” Kirby said. “I feel like once I was educated about those issues and found other Natives, especially here at USC, that’s when I really felt like I was part of my heritage again.” 
While being insecure about her appearance at first, Kirby was able to quickly feel at home in NASA, as it offered her a space to be heard and understood. 
“When I came into this room I instantly felt a bit more comfortable. For me, I know it’s going to be a safe space to just sit with people and interact and feel seen,” said NASA member and social work and public health major Sarandon Gilbert.
With the start of a new school year, NASA is excited to pick up where it left off, conducting in-person meetings and events. Kirby looks forward to branching out into the community, interacting with Indigenous people in the Los Angeles area. 
According to Chase, one of NASA’s most memorable experiences was the Intertribal Education Collaborative, which aims to make Native American youth aware of the opportunities they have in higher education. 
Students, faculty, family members and prospective students gathered that day, creating a comforting atmosphere for Native students on campus — the first time such an event had occurred on a large university campus. 
“It was amazing,” Chase said. “Just being able to be on campus in one of the buildings and hearing people talk rez talk and hearing people from my home, going up to them and saying hello in Navajo and having a small conversation. That’s an experience I never would have imagined to have at a place like USC.”
NASA hopes to continue on this trajectory, attracting more Native students, hosting events such as the USC Prospective Native American Trojans Webinar and making them feel like they have a home here at USC.

One of the best ways to support Indigenous culture is to support the Native-owned brands that give it a voice. Indigenous clothing, art, food and beauty businesses are prospering in North America, from Los Angeles to Canada. The businesses listed below are just a sampling of this thriving creative scene, accessible both in person and online.
X’Tiosu Kitchen
Brothers Felipe and Ignacio Santiago grew up in San Felipe Guila, a small town in Oaxaca, Mexico. Throughout their childhood, they spoke only Zapotec, one of the 50 dialects of an Indigenous language family native to the city.
In 2017, the pair opened X’tiosu Kitchen, an unassuming, outdoorseating-only restaurant. By 2019, it was named one of the 101 best restaurants in L.A. by the Los Angeles Times. 
The tiny eatery is located in a Boyle Heights strip mall, about a 15-minute drive from USC. X’tiosu, which means “thank you” in Zapotec, specializes in Oaxacan-Lebanese fusion dishes ranging from chicken shawarma tacos to tabbouleh with cactus. 
The brothers have amassed a loyal local fanbase as well as national attention. Last year, X’tiosu Kitchen was featured in season two of the hit Netflix series “Ugly Delicious,” which spotlights chefs who aim to use food to overcome stereotypes and share their culture.
NSRGNTS
Art collective and clothing brand NSRGNTS was founded in 2000 by Votan Ik and his partner Leah “Povi” Marie as a way of connecting with their culture and encouraging the spread of Indigenous philosophy. Ik is of Nahuan and Mayan descent and Marie is of Dine, Hopi and Pueblo descent.
NSRGNTS’s moniker is derived from a rebel group in Mexico who protested the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994.
The brand initially hosted powwows, festivals and feasts to bring the community together using handmade clothing, beadwork, pottery and crafts. It then transitioned its activities to an L.A. based brick-and-mortar store, and now, it is online.
Séka Hills Olive Oil
“Séka” means blue in Patwin, a tribal language native to the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation. Séka Hills, an estate-grown wine and olive oil brand, commemorates its Native ancestors that tended to the blue hills that surround Northern California’s Capay Valley. 
“As we strive to preserve our language and the legacy of our ancestors, we continue to grow as a people and tend this fertile valley that is home to our culture, history and tradition,” the Séka Hills website reads. “We maintain the bond our ancestors formed with this land through continued efforts to preserve and protect it for future generations.”
Séka Hills ranked No. 9 in the 2013 Food & Wine magazine Editors’ Top Ten list, which raved about “a buttery small-batch California olive oil that’s remarkably affordable.” The brand has been featured in numerous publications from the New York Times to PBS and earned a 2014 Good Food Awards finalist nod for its Premium Arbequina Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
Séka Hills farms more than 16 crops on its roughly 24,000 acres of land and is one of the few Indigenous groups in California increasing its agricultural production.
According to its website, Séka Hills places an emphasis on sustainability and conservation, with more than 1,200 acres of its land in conservation easement. It aims to imbue future generations with respect for the land.
Urban Native Era
Urban Native Era (UNE) is an L.A. based streetwear brand, spotlighted in both Vogue and Cosmopolitan. Founded by Joey Montoya (Lipan Apache) in 2012, the brand began as a Facebook account to document protests but quickly garnered attention for its use of apparel and design as tools to advocate for Indigenous rights.
“Our daily operations prioritize a better life for Indigenous people around the world,” the UNE website reads. “We seek out spaces where Indigenous people are not traditionally seen, we value the earth and use the most sustainable practices that we can afford, we create a collective community where people can come together as one all while creating fashionable clothing for everyone to wear.”
Indigo Arrows
Indigo Arrows is a contemporary, online-only, home merchandise business based in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Founded by Anishinaabe interior designer Destiny Seymour in 2016, Indigo Arrows offers a selection of pillows, masks, quilts and blankets.
Seymour initially struggled to locate materials she could incorporate into designs but found inspiration in the ancient clay embellishments of local Manitoba Indigenous pottery collections.
All of Seymour’s products are named in Anishinaabemowin, her ancestral language. She aspires to showcase her culture and expand native representation, especially among Indigenous youth. Hence, a portion of Indigo Arrow’s proceeds go to a local after school program championing preteen Indigenous girls.
“I think the world needs more than exhibition — we need these patterns in our homes provoking thought; we need them bridging gaps; and, we need them inspiring our loved ones,” wrote Seymour on the Indigo Arrows website. “The Indigo Arrows line picks up where my ancestors left off.”
B. Yellowtail
Founded by designer and activist Bethany Yellowtail in 2014, the eponymously named B. Yellowtail is an L.A. based sustainable apparel brand and retailer. With the tagline “Indigenously designed for all,” B. Yellowtail’s mission is to help Indigenous businesses thrive and give a platform to authentic native design. The brand sells clothing, art and beauty products and has earned a lot of prominence in just a few years. 
Yellowtail, the founder of the company, is part of the Northern Cheyenne Nation. After extensive experience working in the corporate fashion world, she melded her activist and designer passions to form B. Yellowtail. The apparel brand operated out of an L.A. studio before the pandemic. Now it is stocked in retail stores nationwide following a collaboration with sustainable fashion label Faherty, which is selectively available online.
Chippewar
Vivid colors, pop art inspired designs and uncompromisingly direct social activism are only some of what describes Canadian artist Jay Soule’s art. The Indigenous designer, also known as Chippewar, aims to draw attention to the violent erasure of Indigenous culture across North America. 
Soule’s business and artist name Chippewar is an allusion to both the “traditional warrior role” of Indigenous cultures and the “hostile relationship that Canada’s native people have with the relationship of the land,” according to his website. 
Chippewar sells prints and clothing both online and at a physical retail store in Toronto. His art is simultaneously compelling, clever and sobering, ranging from subversive references like shirts emblazoned with “Buffy the Colonizer Slayer” to his new collection “Built on Genocide.” 
Most recently, Chippewar has stirred discussion with his latest art installation at Ontario Square, visible until Oct. 24, according to NOW Magazine. Consisting of a pile of more than 1,250 bison skull replicas, the art piece aims to educate viewers on the decimation of buffaloes by Canadian colonizers in service of Indigenous genocide.

“Voces of a Pandemic” was born out of the need to record the experiences of Latinx communities in the United States during the coronavirus pandemic. The project started in Spring 2020 and, so far, more than 300 interviews have been conducted across the country, said Maggie Rivas-Rodríguez, the director of Voces Oral History Center.
The project was started by the Voces Oral History Center at the University of Texas at Austin and included 12 institutions including UCLA’s Labor Studies Center and Fundación Luis Muñoz Marín. When USC professor Laura Isabel Serna found out about the project, she knew she wanted to collaborate on it. 
“Given where USC is and the way that COVID-19 affected Latinos in California, it was really important to contribute [to the project] from USC,” Serna said.
As the pandemic unfolded, the media “focused on people who are working from home,” Serna said. This focus excluded many Latinx people, as a large population of Latinx people worked in industries that required in-person activities, such as farming, meat packing, delivery services and custodial services. 
“It seemed really important to capture [Latinx] experiences as well,” Serna said. “When historians or other scholars go back to look at what happened, they also have evidence about what that experience was like for people who were poor, who had to work, who were not part of this white working class that got to go home and do everything on Zoom.” 
According to Rivas-Rodríguez, the pandemic affected Latinx people in particular because they often do not have insurance, which caused them to avoid going to the doctor when they were sick. More individuals got sick as a result, and without access to healthcare, their conditions worsened. This situation was aggravated because many Latinx people live in multi-generational households, Rivas-Rodríguez said. This means that older people, who are high-risk patients, lived with younger people, who may have gotten infected at work, for example.
Another way the pandemic has affected Latinx communities greatly is in their ability to grieve. The impact on people’s wellbeing with not being able to gather and say goodbye to those who have died is something that we have not processed yet as a society, Serna said.
While many of these communities struggled in similar ways, they also faced their own individual struggles. For those who are religiously conservative, many protested against the closing of churches and anti-vaccine ideologies, Serna said.
Other differences in the problems faced during the pandemic were the result of local governments’ responses. At the beginning of the pandemic, Puerto Rico’s government implemented lockdowns and mask mandates. But, despite implementing early precautions, the pandemic worsened the economic situation on the island. Even before the pandemic, the economic situation was fragile because of the natural disasters that affected the island for the past years and government corruption. Many businesses were too affected to reopen after the lockdown, said Silvia Álvarez Curbelo, who oversees the portion of the project that was made in Puerto Rico.
The differences in backgrounds and lived experiences for Latinx people are what make the “Voces of a Pandemic” project so rich. Every person that is interviewed tells their own story, Rivas-Rodríguez said. 
“I think it’s important to just look at the texture of all of these different interviews and not try to shoehorn them into any one kind of category,” Rivas-Rodríguez said.
A story that particularly struck Rivas-Rodríguez was one of a man whose father died at the beginning of the pandemic. 
“He wanted to do this interview because he wanted it understood that his father was more than a number,” Rivas-Rodríguez said. “I think that’s part of the importance of these oral history interviews … What we’re trying to do is put a face on those stories and put a name to them and say these are people that had families. They had dreams. They weren’t ready to go.’’
With the pandemic, one of the biggest challenges has been finding funding to hire people to help in the project, Rivas-Rodríguez said. This includes finding more interviewers as well as people to keep a record of the interviews done in each institution. Despite this, Rivas-Rodríguez said she would like to conduct more interviews in specific areas, especially Latinx news and media.
“In communities all over the country, there are small newspapers that are produced as labors of love, and people just pour their hearts and souls into these things,” Rivas-Rodríguez said. “They don’t make much money. When the pandemic hit, their advertising just dried up … So I think that’s one area that I really, really want us to look at.”
One thing Serna wants people to take away from “Voces of a Pandemic” is that “the really diverse experiences of Latino communities across the U.S. deserve to be recorded and remembered and made part of the public record.”

We’re back in business with another edition of my top ten. Junior receiver Drake London kicks off for us this week, with freshman setter Mia Tuaniga and some red-hot teams taking the stage later. Let’s roll. 
The Drake London Experience
Where would we be without London? To say our offense runs through the junior wide receiver would be a misnomer. London is our offense. A catch-of-the-year candidate highlighted his clinic in Colorado, as the junior wideout ran wild throughout. He added 130 yards and a touchdown to his Biletnikoff case against the Buffaloes. London’s 16 receptions against Utah were also tied for the second most by a Trojan receiver in a single game. London continues to look like the standout receiver in college football. 
Mia Tuaniga’s Bullet Serves
The freshman transfer from Long Beach State has got an absolute cannon for an arm. Tuaniga passes more than just the eye test, though, as she’s got excellent stats to boot. Tuaniga ranks second on the team in assists and third in aces, showing no signs of inexperience in her performances. She’ll hope to add another standout showing when the team takes on Arizona State and Arizona later this week.
Basketball boots up
USC basketball tipped off at its first practice earlier this month. The Trojans will look to build off their first Elite Eight appearance in 20 years last season. Andy Enfield’s men lost standout center Evan Mobley to the NBA draft, but they should still be a formidable force in the Pac-12. Last spring, they finished at No. 6 in Kenpom’s adjusted defensive efficiency rankings and they’ll look to keep that staunch defensive work up this season.
Trigg takes off
Recruited out of high school as a two-sport athlete, freshman receiver Michael Trigg has started getting into a rhythm on the football field. After tallying just seven yards through three games, Trigg went for a combined 95 yards and a touchdown against Oregon State and Colorado. If the wideout keeps this up, the Trojan quarterbacks will have a much easier job.
Women’s soccer on fire 
Nine straight wins for the USC soccer team, who remain undefeated in conference play. Arizona and Colorado never even had a shot, as both conceded 4 goals in their respective losses to the Trojans. USC will look to keep up its blazing form against Oregon later this week.
Water warriors
The No. 1 ranked men’s water polo team was undefeated before suffering a tight 7-6 defeat to No. 5 Cal Saturday. Despite the loss, this team has a ton of talent with six Tokyo Olympians highlighting the skilled squad. They’ve got as good a shot as anyone in the country to win the national championship and they’re definitely worth keeping an eye on.
Penelope Hocking 
strikes again
Senior forward Penelope Hocking scored against Colorado last week, something she’s now done more than any other player in USC history. As the all-time leading scorer in team history, she joins Trojan record-setters Harold Miner (points-basketball) and Matt Barkley (touchdowns-football) in the history books. 
Salute to the parents
Parents covered campus this past weekend for family weekend, all corners of the country converging here. They are the foundation of athletics at all levels, supporting their athletes everywhere from Saturday morning soccer games to Friday night football. Without them, we wouldn’t have USC athletes, and they deserve to be recognized for it.
Carson Palmer enshrined
Former Heisman-winning quarterback Carson Palmer was honored at Saturday’s game against Utah for his entrance into the College Football Hall of Fame. Palmer was the first Trojan quarterback to ever win the Heisman, and his work in the NFL wasn’t shabby either. 
Intramural Drama II: Stunning Collapse
As our regular readers will know, the Daily Trojan typically covers the cut-and-dry excellence of Division I athletics. Once a column, though, I scrape the edges of the brownie tin that is intramural sports to find crunchy bits of action to share. I followed up with the men’s soccer squad from our previous recap, witnessing them grind out an 11-1 victory. Sophomore Derek Laureola, who scored four goals, had this to say after the game: “I’m utterly disappointed, I let my team down … I take full responsibility.” The team was incredibly disappointed to concede, even as they won by 10 goals. Not often has such a strong commitment to absolute perfection been seen on Brittingham’s hallowed grounds.

I don’t quite remember how many times I’ve watched the 2013 K-drama series “The Heirs,” but I think I’m more invested in the characters than in myself. It’s my absolute favorite K-drama series and I will forever fight (figuratively, not physically) anyone who claims it doesn’t have a deeper meaning. 
On the surface, “The Heirs” is similar to any teenage love story. There’s your ordinary Everygirl, Cha Eun Sang (Park Shin-hye), who wealthy conglomerate heir Kim Tan (Lee Min-ho) falls for during an accidental meeting in Los Angeles. 
When both of them return to South Korea, however, Eun Sang begins attending the same elite school as Tan. The pair are polar opposites. He’s wealthy; she juggles multiple part-time jobs to support her struggling mother. The differences between them grow more evident as Eun Sang wrestles with the disapproval of Tan’s parents, as well as a competing love interest.
Only episodes one to four are actually set in L.A., but the city is the catalyst for the drama. Eun Sang and Tan first meet in L.A., and in the minimal time that Eun Sang and Tan spend together in the city, it serves as their emotional point of connection. While I could go on and on purely about the romantic aspect of it (and am always glad to do so), I want to talk about the narrative significance of L.A. for both characters. That requires providing some context. 
Eun Sang is a financially struggling high school student who is told by her mother that her sister Eun Suk is getting married in the United States and needs money. Eun Sang is rightfully bitter at this. After Eun Suk left, Eun Sang took on the burden of supporting her family. Eun Sang decides she will personally take the money to Eun Suk. She doesn’t tell her mother that she dreams of staying in L.A. even after she’s given the money.
Tan has been exiled from South Korea and lives in L.A, as his older brother is afraid Tan will threaten him for a position in the family company. Tan’s waiting for the moment he can return home to South Korea, where his heart is. 
For Eun Sang, the idea of going to L.A. begins as a dream. A tearful Eun Sang expresses her hope that she’ll become successful in the U.S. This moment demonstrates what I love so much about “The Heirs:” It’s a K-drama series that explores themes of class, but also this poignant idea of the American Dream and how sometimes it’s only an illusion. 
For Eun Sang, L.A. serves as a means of escapism from the bleak realities of her life back home. She dreams of having a better life in the U.S. — L.A. and its glamour are essential to this.
Yet when Eun Sang arrives in L.A. and actually sees her sister Eun Suk, she finds that everything her sister told her about her shining life in L.A. was false. Eun Suk is struggling, financially and otherwise. In a particularly emotional confrontation, an angry Eun Sang condemns her sister’s lies. “You were my dream,” Eun Sang tells her. 
Her sister tells her to turn a blind eye and then snatches all the money Eun Sang brought to support her “wedding.” As Eun Suk runs away, Eun Sang cries, “Mom worked so hard for that money!” In this moment, we see the carefully curated illusion of Eun Suk’s success versus the disappointing reality of it. 
Tan, who has witnessed Eun Sang’s fight with her sister by accident, has a beautiful California beach house and attends a scenic high school. He lives the quintessential American Dream. However, Tan is deeply lonely and longs to be with his family in South Korea. 
Both characters find the glamour of L.A. doesn’t hold any meaning for them. To me, they connect not just because of a shared language or culture, or because this is a K-drama and they have to, but because they have a shared experience of realizing this illusion. Beyond all the amazing L.A. sites depicted in the drama, L.A. is a place where dreams and reality conflict. It’s a phenomenon they’ve witnessed firsthand.  
While I began watching the drama for the love story it advertised, I found myself thinking about my parents’ immigrant experience. Maybe I’m silly for reading so much into it, but I thought about my parents as Eun Sang, who comes to the U.S. hoping she’ll change her life and achieve the American Dream. I also thought about them as Tan, who, despite having that “shining” life on the outside, is homesick and doesn’t feel like he truly belongs in the U.S. I was reminded of my own dream of coming to L.A. and how it hasn’t quite been the illusion I crafted for myself. 
Of course, there’s a more hopeful moment in the series. As Eun Sang prepares to leave L.A., she comments wistfully on her time there: “It felt like a midsummer night’s dream. I’m going to disappear now just like the dream I had last night.” 
This line encapsulates how, in spite of all the difficulties the reality of L.A. presents, there’s something still so beautiful about spending time in the city. There’s a kind of magic in the L.A. illusion and living here. Maybe it’s not all that real. Perhaps it’ll even disappear at some point. For the moment though, it’s a dream. Believe in it.

“Far Cry 6” is Ubisoft’s latest entry into the “Far Cry” franchise and a return to form as the first game since “Far Cry 3” to be set on a tropical island. After the franchise’s exploration around the world in its previous entries, returning to the ocean’s pristine and luscious views certainly brings nostalgia for older fans. Those jaw-dropping views, however, are not enough to hide the obvious problems littered throughout the game. 
“Far Cry 6” thrusts the player into the fictional nation of Yara, an idyllic Caribbean nation suffering from four decades of economic sanctions until the main antagonist, Antón Castillo (Giancarlo Esposito), who assumed power as a totalitarian dictator. You, as revolutionary Dani Rojas, are given the opportunity to liberate the nation along with the band of characters you meet that constitute “the Resistance.” 
For such an enthralling premise, the game’s narrative does not live up to its potential. The first hours attempt to introduce the player to the game’s conflict, characters and setting, only to rush through the exposition and leave the player with more questions than answers. Most of the time, it is just assumed the player understands why they are doing certain things. 
Dialogue, while genuinely humorous at times, is not always consistent in its tone and grows irritating at times. Some characters, such as Castillo, are utilized well and not prone to massive shifts in personality for a one-off joke or plot point. Others, however, are written like they were made from a dartboard of stereotypes or given dialogue that makes them insufferable. Seeing an important cutscene interjected with a random Spanish word or a quirky character erases the tension to an almost infuriating degree at times.  
Hearing the word “coño” or guerilla for the tenth time does not make me think I am in a Spanish-speaking country, it makes me want to put the game in its Spanish language pack or even turn the audio off. 
Once you get missions from characters, the game delivers its refined combat onto a mostly bland assortment of mission types. In one series of missions, Rojas has to follow a rooster named Chicharrón and kill a number of soldiers in order to mark these places with Chicharrón callsign. It was quite entertaining initially and even got a chuckle out of me. 
The problem comes where after finishing the first mission, you are basically doing the same thing with a new coat of paint. While repetitive missions are not always bad, the fact that we are on the sixth entry and missions can still feel like something made 10 years ago significantly dampens the enjoyment of the experience. 
This would be less of an issue if you were given suitable rewards, but “Far Cry 6” did away with the perk system and player leveling in general. Now, your player rank determines the weapons and items you can purchase at stores located in and around your hideouts. These weapons can also be found through searching crates in mission areas, completely negating the need to purchase them. “Far Cry 6” also did away with enemy-granting experience points when you kill them, only awarding points when completing missions or through other non-standard or inconvenient methods.
With the perk system gone, certain skills and abilities that were normally skill unlocks are now relegated to clothing items, which are found randomly throughout the game world and can be bought. You can only equip four clothing items at a time, significantly reducing the amount of abilities the player can have and, with some abilities more valuable than others, leaving some clothing items useless and others essential.
Similarly for the weapons, I am still using the basic FAL the game gave me in the first hour of the game and am nearing the 10-hour mark, while the shotgun I randomly got from a crate does more damage on a consistent basis than a sniper rifle.   
While “Far Cry 6” definitely falters and regresses compared to past entries, it’s brilliant moments shine. Considering the breadth of the game map and the serene views that permeate throughout, it does not feel like a chore to trek across the map. Instead, it proves to be one of the most relaxing times I ever had in a video game as I admired the brimming blues of the ocean and the green jungles bathed in sunlight. 
“Far Cry 6” is a sum of weathered and polished parts. The narrative and dialogue show a lack of understanding in their use of complex political events when the studio is not committed to having a stern opinion or reflecting on the source material. The dumbing down of gameplay elements and streamlining of certain aspects also diminishes player flexibility and customization. 
On the other hand, rough edges in the game design are not enough to put a damper on the exhilarating exploration and joy-inducing free roaming the game gives to the player. “Far Cry 6,” for all its faults, still proves to be a great time. 
Author’s Note: “Far Cry 6” was reviewed on a PS5, copy provided by Ubisoft.

Content warning: This article contains references to violence against women. 
The disappearance and homicide of Gabby Petito gained widespread media attention across the United States — over six law-enforcement agencies searched for her and #GabbyPetito garnered more than 950 million views on TikTok.
On Sept. 19, police discovered her remains in Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming. Police consider Petito’s fiance Brian Laundrie, who has been missing since the beginning of the investigation, a person of interest in the case. 
However, would Petito’s case receive as much attention if she were a person of color, specifically an Indigenous woman? According to the Wyoming Statewide Report on Missing and Murdered Indigenous People, more than 700 Indigenous Americans — most of whom are women and girls — have been reported missing from Wyoming in the past decade. 
The report also stated that in the U.S. overall, only 30% of homicide victims who were of Indigenous descent had newspaper media coverage, compared to 51% of white homicide victims. Of this 30%, 18% were Indigenous women homicide victims, which is the lowest amount of newspaper media coverage for all groups. Not to mention the fact that the rate of American Indian and Alaskan Native women who were murdered living on tribal lands exceeds the national average by 10 times. 
Mainstream media prioritizes white women who have gone missing or been murdered, neglecting Indigenous women in the same position, which warrants changes in journalism and governmental entities to bring awareness to these victims as well. 
Indigenous women face a crisis in the U.S. As of 2021, the National Crime Information Center reports that “about 1,500 American Indian and Alaska Native missing persons and nearly 2,700 women have been murdered.”
The lack of sensitivity from law enforcement affects these cases. According to the Sovereign Bodies Institute Report, families report inadequate communication, lack of cultural awareness and systemic violence committed against Indigenous communities. Additionally, critics attribute underreporting of cases to unfavorable relationships between tribal governments and outside law enforcement.
In the case of Petito, whose murder went viral due to internet sleuths, the media followed with intense enthusiasm. However, what occurred to her was common: Distressed loved ones brought a claim to the news media — outlets which are increasingly white. The Census Bureau reports marginalized racial and ethnic groups make up approximately 17% of newsroom staffs, despite composing 40% of the U.S. population. 
How can we elevate the cases of Indigenous women who have gone missing and been murdered?
First, changes in leadership and focus in law enforcement need to happen. The Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women report recommended adequate funding and resources to officers in Native American communities combating this epidemic and further addressing systemic discrimination. For instance, Minnesota was the first state to implement a state’s office on Indigenous people who have gone missing and been murdered, hoping to establish “statewide protocol for investigations” and appropriate allocation of resources for tribal law enforcement. 
Secondly, the media must improve how it reports cases of missing or murdered people. For instance, a Washington Post article described Petito as a “blue-eyed, blonde adventure seeker.” It weaponized this Eurocentric characterization to raise awareness of Petito, which speaks to how our culture reacts to missing women depending on their race. Responsible journalists can combat this inequity by avoiding such habits. 
Lastly, mainstream media requires more Native American journalists and reporters. Native Americans comprise 1.7% of the U.S. population yet only 0.5% of individuals who work in the news industry. If not enough of a particular demographic work in this sector, it lacks necessary perspectives. 
Report for America recently partnered with the Native American Journalists Association to support 19 indigenous journalists through 2021. Maggie Messitt, a senior advisor for Report for America, stated, “The history of U.S. journalism is largely a history of neglecting and even harming Indigenous communities.”
If more news organizations can do similar tasks, the media can boost Native American issues such as women who have gone missing or been murdered in press coverage. Reforms can bring greater attention to this epidemic in the media and government sectors.

June 16, 2020, 10:42 p.m. The moment I became a mother. Eleven months later, I remember the emotions that coursed through my veins the second I stirred together the rye flour and water that made me a mother to Doughby, my magnificent sourdough starter.
Like much of the internet, I spent 2020 fostering an obsession with naturally-leavened bread. As part of the sourdough community, I feel like one of the lucky few who discovered this special world of fermentation, privy to the pleasure and privilege of slicing into freshly baked sourdough loaves.
It took me months to realize fermenting dough was not the novelty I believed it was. I’ve been watching my mother make dosa batter for longer than I can remember. Soaked rice spends days developing a pungent sour flavor, eventually transforming into light, crispy crepes filled with spiced potatoes. The process might vary with sourdough bread, but my mother has performed the ancient art of fermentation for years.
This chemical process is all around us, playing an integral role in everything from Korean kimchi to Nigerian cassava. Despite fermentation’s rich history and multicultural span, Western practices predominantly informed the pandemic’s fermentation craze. Since sourdough’s pandemic-induced internet fame reinvigorated this age-old practice, we’ve ignored its ties to Black and brown communities in favor of viral crumb shots.
For many bakers, sourdough transitioned from an Instagram trend to a business model. Beyond crumb shots and scoring patterns, bakers with thousands of Instagram followers can seek out brand deals, start their own podcasts and sell their own sourdough recipe books. 
For instance, Kristen Dennis, known as @foolproofbaking on Instagram, founded a company that sells products for home sourdough bakers. Similarly, many consider Maurizio Leo, creator of The Perfect Loaf blog, to be one of the most informed sourdough bakers, and his blog inspired thousands of people to begin their own fermentation journey. Through his social media presence, he landed a job as the resident baker for Food52, a well-known culinary magazine.
The sourdough community’s home-baker-to-wealthy-influencer pipeline is no different from the average person’s transformation into an Instagram personality. Despite appealing to different crowds, well-known sourdough authorities and influencers both leverage their following to earn money.
Although fermentation holds a rich history in communities of color, most profiting sourdough bakers are white. The most popular sourdough authorities on Instagram are Dennis, Matthew Duffy, Leo, Bryan Ford, Mike from Rosehill Sourdough, Gareth from Memoirs of a Baker and Hannah from Blondie and Rye. Of the “Big Seven,” six are white.
Fermentation was born in Black and brown communities, from North African yogurt to Indian dhokla. Historians date fermentation back to Ancient China in 7,000 B.C. Others speculate dairy fermentation started as early as 10,000 B.C. in Northern Africa. Although we do not exactly know when it was invented, we do know bread fermentation was first recorded in Egypt and later spread to Greece and France. In the Western world, it is this Egyptian-inspired naturally leavened bread that has since evolved into the modern day sourdough bread. 
However, the more fame the practice receives, the fewer fermenters of color emerge as authorities in the space. As bakers such as Dennis and Leo turn baking sourdough bread into a financially profitable business, they forget this practice began in communities of color — a practice white bakers now leverage as a financial scheme.
Fermentation is one of the many instances in which white people have taken work from communities of color and rebranded it. For example, following the murder of George Floyd in May 2020 and the reemergence of the Black Lives Matter movement, people formed book clubs with the intention of reading anti-racism literature.
Anti-racism literature topped the non-fiction charts week after week, with one book repeatedly at the #1 spot: “White Fragility” by Robin DiAngelo, a white woman who explains race from the lens of someone with race privilege. She distills what she has been taught by people of color, but many argue she delivers the knowledge in a way that talks down to Black people.
Countless Black authors published books about anti-racism, but many Americans do not appreciate their work because they are more comfortable learning about race from the perspective of someone who has never experienced racism. Devaluing books written by authors of color reinforces the ideology that white work is more respectable and prestigious.
It may seem superfluous to critically think about social media bakers’ races, but sourdough culture is a microcosm of white people’s colonization of Black and brown work. The sourdough community reflects our society’s acceptance of white professionals profiting off people of color’s work.        
Mothering Doughby has connected me to a virtual community of fermenters, but as the practice becomes more popular, voices of color are fighting for a place in the conversation they started. The prevalence of white authorities in fermentation is a reminder of the work needed to dismantle the colonization of Black and brown spaces.
There is a world in which equality and justice are not just ideas but a way of life. By amplifying Black and brown voices, we have the power to create such a world, starting both inside and outside the fermentation community.
