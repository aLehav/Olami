Senior forward Elizabeth Eddy was selected by Sky Blue FC in the fourth round of the 2014 National Women’s Soccer League draft last Friday, becoming the seventh USC player in program history to join a women’s professional league.
Doing it all · Elizabeth Eddy scored 16 goals over four seasons for the USC women’s soccer team at forward and midfielder. Eddy also started nine times for the Women of Troy’s lacrosse team last year. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Eddy’s elite athleticism helped her serve as a jackknife of sorts for the Women of Troy, as the Newport Beach, Calif. native played defender, midfielder and forward throughout her collegiate career. But no matter where she played, Eddy was always an integral part of USC’s rotation, starting 69 games in 76 appearances.
“I would not be surprised if she was the greatest athlete at USC,” former USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said in an interview with the Daily Trojan before the 2013 season began. “I never have to worry about her being fit or strong enough to perform.”
USC’s season didn’t go according to plan — the Women of Troy finished 8-10-2 to miss the NCAA Tournament for the third straight season, resulting in the firing of Khosroshahin. Still, Eddy showed she had a killer scoring instinct after transitioning back from the defensive side of the ball.
Eddy was USC’s top scorer (six goals) in her senior season, ending her career with 16 goals and nine assists. After scoring three goals in the Women of Troy’s first two games, she became the first USC player to be named the Pac-12 Player of the Week since 2010.
After graduation, the No. 33 overall pick will join USC graduate Ashley Nick on Sky Blue FC. Another former Woman of Troy, U.S. Olympian Amy Rodriguez, was drafted No. 1 by the Boston Breakers in 2009 and now suits up for FC Kansas City.
Upon joining Sky Blue FC in Piscataway Township, N.J., Eddy will become the fourth USC alumna to join a NWSL team — former USC forward Rosa Anna Tantillo played briefly for FC Gold Pride in 2010 to follow in the footsteps of Rodriguez and Nick. Three other Women of Troy participated in the now-defunct Women’s United Soccer Association.
But Eddy’s athletic career at USC isn’t finished quite yet. She joined the lacrosse team in its first year of Division 1 play last year. That team starts its season on Feb. 28 with a home match against Marist.

USC always has been, and always will be, one of the most respected athletic programs in the country. A large part of this perception has to do with the football team, of course, but what oftentimes fails to go acknowledged is the variety of spring sports where the Trojans are usually perennial contenders for an NCAA title.
Up until last year this was the case with the USC men’s tennis team. The Trojans won four straight NCAA titles with former player Steve Johnson at the helm from 2009 through 2012, but faltered last season and bowed out in the quarterfinal round of the NCAA tournament. This season, the Trojans kicked the season off ranked No. 5 in the season by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association.
During my time on the tennis beat during the 2013 spring season, it dawned on me that college tennis wasn’t just great to watch to support the Trojans or as part of my job as a writer for the Daily Trojan — it was that collegiate tennis is an opportunity to catch the game played at an incredibly high level. Though the game played on television by professionals is spellbinding enough, watching a match live and firsthand is an altogether different experience.
What changes most drastically between watching a match on television and watching a match live is the speed of the game. Observing from the usual isometric angle afforded to typical television audiences, the typical tennis match seems like a large game of Pong with human bodies moving back and forth as paddles. Up close, the game is an entirely different beast. Tennis is a thinking man’s game, one that is as cerebral as it is instinctual.
In the live game, the minutiae of the game comes to the forefront: the sweat on the backs of the players, each labored breath between points, the thrill of each blistering serve and each breathless chase-down slice come together to form a type of physical artistry.
And then there’s the drama: each match is a prizefight. The physical punishment of deep,  heavy strokes that require extra effort to return, the slumping shoulders and utter despair of the player on the wrong side of an extended point. One player will smell blood, the other will become the prey. There are no excuses in tennis, no moral victories and no consolation for losers. It is man versus man, and man versus himself — the ball serves as an intermediary of wills.
All of these things are true about USC men’s tennis. The varying styles and personalities of all the different players come together on the USC team. There’s a classic big server in sophomore Max de Vroome, a power flat ground stroke player in junior Jonny Wang, a left-handed topspin savant in junior Roberto Quiroz and the cerebral shot-making magician in senior Ray Sarmiento. All of the above mentioned players are nationally ranked by the ITA in singles play, and each of their styles will be on display as the Trojans look to capture their fifth NCAA title in six years.
Tennis as a collegiate sport is perhaps more immediately affected by recruiting than any other college sport: one strong recruit can turn the tide and bring a wave of success, much in the same way Johnson did for the Trojans and former ITA Singles No. 1 Alex Domijan did for the University of Virginia in the Cavaliers’ 2013 national title campaign.
To that effect, the Trojans will be bringing in freshman Robbie Bellamy, who was rated as a blue-chip player, and freshman Nicholas Crystal, who was rated a five-star prospect by TennisRecruiting.com. Crystal was ranked as the No. 1 player in the state of New York, and Bellamy was the No. 9 high school player in the nation.
But winning and supporting the Trojan family shouldn’t be the only reason to attend men’s tennis matches this semester. It’s truly a beautiful game, a glorious athletic spectacle. Though interest in tennis in America is still a tough sell without the involvement of Serena Williams, the game remains one of the last bastions of grace and tradition in a sports world mired with me-first team athletes and supercharged egos. It’s a game that prizes agility, grace and precision over outright aggression, and in that way it possesses a timeless beauty.
The USC men’s tennis team kicks off its 2014 quest for a title Saturday at Marks Stadium against the Santa Clara Broncos at 11 a.m. I’m not a beat writer for the tennis team anymore. But you might find me there taking in the beautiful game and cheering on the Trojans.

The men’s volleyball team hit its first roadblock last week with a tough loss at the hands of the Pepperdine Waves. Still, there’s plenty of optimism around the program going forward this season. The Trojans will get a chance to rebound against Long Beach State today in what should be another highly contested Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference matchup.
Stepping up · Freshman Lucas Yoder has 66 kills to lead the Trojans. Yoder has started all four games for the team this year. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (3-1, 2-1 MPSF) came into the Galen Center last Thursday night, Jan. 16, looking to stay unbeaten in the early season after wins over Loyola-Chicago, UC San Diego and UC Irvine. The Trojans, however fell to the Waves (3-0, 3-0) in four sets by a score of 26-28, 25-22, 25-22, 26-24.
“I was disappointed by the result,” starting junior setter Micah Christenson said. “But I’m still feeling good about the season moving forward.”
“I’m happy that it’s still early in the season,” Christenson said after the game. “We have a lot of things to get better at but we also have a lot of positives to take from this match. Pepperdine’s a very good team, very well-coached and hats off to them. They dug the ball and blocked the ball very well tonight.”
USC head coach Bill Ferguson added to Christenson’s points.
“The team did not look as good as it usually does defensively,” Ferguson said. “We definitely weren’t at our best.”
Ferguson also praised his opponent’s play. “Pepperdine was playing great,” the eighth-year coach said. “There were just too many defensive plays that we normally make that we didn’t make tonight. Digs, balls that are hit near us that we get all the time and we just weren’t there.”
He added that the team didn’t react very well after losing big points.
“We left a lot of points out on the court,” Ferguson said. “I thought we got out of sorts a little bit and we had some plays we normally make that just wasn’t happening for us and I think we were letting that get to us. I think we got too frustrated. If we would lose a big point we would get frustrated rather than move on to the next play and it’s a good learning experience for us. We have that experience and we can learn from it, and that’s the cool thing.”
Christenson agreed that given the experience Pepperdine has over the Trojans, a relatively young team with several freshmen cracking the starting roster, it might some time before USC reaches its full potential.
“They’ve had that core for three years, so they don’t have any time lost getting to know each other,” he said. “We are a new team and it’s very positive that we’re scaring good teams and beating good teams with the short amount of time that we’ve had to learn each other.”
Christenson had 50 assists on the night as well as two service aces. Senior libero Henry Cassiday led the team with 21 digs. Freshman outside hitter Lucas Yoder led the team with 16 kills along with nine errors, junior middle blocker Robert Feathers had 10 kills and three errors and freshman middle blocker Andy Benesh had nine kills with one error.
Even though redshirt senior Maddison McKibbin has gotten most of the starts at opposite this year, junior Cristian Rivera got the starting nod there and McKibbin spelled him later in the match. Yoder started along with sophomore Alex Slaught on the outside, though redshirt freshman Christopher Orenic substituted in for Slaught late in the match. McKibbin finished with three kills and an error, Rivera had seven kills and seven errors, Slaught had six kills and five errors, while Orenic had three kills with two errors.
“We have a ton of depth,” Ferguson said, who at times will stick with his starting lineup for the entire game but used much more of the bench against Pepperdine. “We’re going to use that depth to our advantage.”
In addition to the tough early competition, Ferguson said the team’s travel schedule has been relatively hectic early on in the season but that the team should get into more of a normal routine as the year goes on. The Trojans began their season with a road trip two weeks ago to Chicago to play Loyola-Chicago, then hosted UC Irvine last Tuesday before the Pepperdine game last Thursday. After today’s game against Long Beach State, the team travels to Cal State Northridge on Friday.
“We’re back to a bit of a normal schedule for us where we’re either Wednesday/Friday or Thursday/Saturday and I think that’ll help us,” he said. “We get a couple of days off, we’ve had a funky schedule with a Tuesday game and coming back from Chicago on a Monday the previous week so now we’re back to normal.”
Ferguson said that today’s game should be another competitive conference match, particularly in the middle of the court where Long Beach State likes to attack from. The Trojans sit at fourth in the nation, while Long Beach State (3-2, 2-2) is ranked fifth in the American Volleyball Coaches Association poll released Monday. Pepperdine jumped to the top spot in the poll after its win against USC.
“They’re very outside hitter-oriented,” Ferguson said. “Their middles hit right next to the setter and they always have a hitter coming over the middle. It’s a back row outside hitter coming down the middle. Taylor Crabb was the National Player of the Year last year and he’s one of those outside hitters. Dalton Ammerman is their other outside and they really make things go.”
The Trojans will face Long Beach State tonight at 7 p.m.

The USC men’s basketball team will continue its quest for its first Pac-12 win under first-year head coach Andy Enfield as they prepare to take on California tonight at 8 p.m.
Key addition · Guard J.T. Terrell is averaging 10.4 points per game this season, good for second on the team. Terrell has only played in 10 games since being declared academically eligible in mid-December. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
USC (9-9, 0-5 Pac-12) remains the only team in the Pac-12 without a conference win after losing 84-66 to Utah (14-4, 3-3) and 83-62 to Colorado (15-4, 4-2). Senior guard J.T. Terrell led the Trojans over the weekend, averaging 14 points in losses to the Utes and Buffaloes. The team shot a combined 46-of-107 (43 percent) from the field in those two games, including 8-of-25 (32 percent) from behind the arc.
“We had a great energy to start the game and we missed five point-blank shots in the lane in the first three, four minutes of the game,” Enfield said after the game against Colorado. “Then we turned the ball over when we had a layup. We basically missed 12 points to start the game. That enabled them to jump out on us and Colorado is an excellent team.”
The Trojans have been outscored by an average of 22.4 points in their last five games — all losses. It’s the second time in the last three years USC has started 0-5 in conference play — they lost their first eight games in the Pac-12 in 2012.
The bright spot for the Trojans is their 7-2 record this season at the Galen Center, including a seven-game winning streak at home to start the season. Home dominance has been a theme in the Pac-12 this season. Every team in the conference claims a winning record at home, which makes home contests such as the Trojans’ next two extremely important.
Junior guard Byron Wesley leads the team with 16.5 points per game and 7.4 rebounds per game. Terrell is USC’s only other double-digit scorer, averaging 10.4 points per game. Senior guard Pe’Shon Howard is averaging 9.8 points per game and is second on the team with 3.9 assists per game, while senior center Omar Oraby is averaging 8.9 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.6 blocks per game.
The Golden Bears (14-4, 5-0 Pac-12) are tied for first in the Pac-12 with No. 1 Arizona (18-0, 5-0). Cal is coming off of dominating performances over both Washington schools, picking up an 82-56 victory against Washington (11-8, 3-3) and a 76-55 win over Washington State (8-10, 1-5).
Justin Cobbs leads five Cal players averaging double-digit points on the season with 14.9 points per game, while also leading the team in assists per game with 6.4. Richard Solomon is averaging 12.1 points per game, and is the team’s leading rebounder with 10.3 per game. Highly touted freshman Jabari Bird has averaged 10.1 points per game in one of the deepest conferences in the nation.
USC has lost its last four games against California, and is 8-8 against the Golden Bears in their last 16 meetings. The Golden Bears lead the all-time series 132-120. Coach Mike Montgomery has led the Bears to the NCAA tournament in four of the last five seasons. In the same span, USC has only reached the tournament twice.
USC will play Stanford (12-5, 3-2) on Jan. 26 at 2 p.m. at the Galen Center before heading to Oregon next week as they take on Oregon State (10-7, 2-3) on Jan. 30 at 6 p.m. and Oregon (13-4, 1-4) on Sunday, Feb. 1 at 5 p.m. All three games will be available on the Pac-12 Networks.

Congressman Buck McKeon, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, discussed federal spending, military issues and foreign trade with students from the USC Marshall School of Business.
Capitol Hill · Congressman Buck McKeon made his first public appearance after announcing he was retiring from Congress on Jan. 16. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
 
The event, hosted at Town and Gown Tuesday evening, allowed attendees to engage in an intimate dialogue with the politician. The event was McKeon’s first public appearance since announcing his retirement on Jan. 16th.
Scott McKeon, an alumnus of Marshall’s Master of Business Administration program in 2007, introduced his uncle, Buck McKeon.
“He certainly is a defender of our freedom, a defender of our faith and a defender of our family,” McKeon said.
Throughout his speech, McKeon shared unique insights from his 21 years in politics and commented on current events.
He specifically expressed concern over the state of the economy, and explained how budget cuts have affected military preparedness. Since 2010, McKeon stated that the government has cut a trillion dollars from national defense.
“If you cut back the funding, [troops] are not getting all of the necessary training. The government has had to cut corners and they’ve done it, because you know you run out of ways to save money and that’s where most of it comes out of–operations maintenance,” McKeon said.
While McKeon remains committed to providing American troops with the upper hand in combat, budget cuts have made it increasingly difficult to uphold this responsibility.
“General Odierno, Chief of the U.S. Army, told us just a few weeks ago that 85 percent of the army is not now ready to go into combat,” McKeon said. “There are three things that concern me the most out of all of these cuts to our national security. Number one is cuts in readiness.”
This major campaign to reduce funding has threatened America’s position as a global leader. McKeon used a bullying metaphor to expand upon this point.
“You guys remember the kindergarten bully? He kind of ruled the grounds until somebody bloodied his nose,” he said. “Well if nobody bloodies his nose, everybody’s scared and everyone wants to be friends with a bully. Well that’s what happens with nations. If we’re not there, others will come up. Do we want that to be Russia?”
McKeon also mentioned Iran and China as serious national security threats.
 
Following the congressman’s lecture, students had the opportunity to engage in a question and answer session. Gilberto Barrios, a senior majoring in business administration, benefited from this opportunity.
“The recent campaign to downsize our military has serious repercussions that aren’t being communicated to the masses,” Barrios said. “The biggest takeaway for me was that we need to have this information more accessible to the public so we can make more informed military decisions.”
Kara Junttila, a freshman majoring in international relations, found the event applicable to her studies.
“Congressman McKeon’s lecture reminded me why I’m studying what I’m studying and started some great conversations about the state of our nation,” she said.
Grace Braun, a freshman majoring in business administration, gained valuable political insights from the event.
“I’m a student Democrat but it was really informative for me to hear the other side,” Braun said. “His talk helped broaden my perspective.”

Michael Ignatieff, former leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, discussed his work with the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs and his attempts at understanding ethics on a global scale Tuesday night.
The event, put on through Ignatieff’s partnership with USC’s Leventhan Institute for Humanities and Ethics, examined the politician’s recent visit to the Los Angeles area and took place in the University Club.
His mission is part of a project to describe ethical systems in various cities through a series of site-based studies. USC worked closely with Ignatieff during this visit to provide him with contacts.
Ignatieff’s visit to Los Angeles included visits to various faith-based communities, reformed gang members, and student newspapers.
The talk focused on how Los Angeles’ citizens create what he coined as an “ethical operating system,” or a system of codes that aim to promote general good in the city.
“I think every city needs an operating system, shared moral [assumptions] that let people live together on a daily basis, for shared interests will only get you so far, but shared ethics will let people stick together no matter what,” Ignatieff said.
Ignatieff also stressed that Los Angeles is an important model for moral actions across the country.
“L.A. is the source of an enormous number of our moral assumptions; it’s the global capital of the entertainment industry,” Ignatieff said. “From Blade Runner to Reservoir Dogs to Pulp Fiction, the media instills us with images of dystopian and utopian cities.”
Ignatieff, however, also views Los Angeles as more than just a source of global assumptions. He sees a complex system of communities that allow for ethical conflict and rebuilding.
“In L.A., ethical life feels like joining traffic in the freeway, you count on everyone to do the right thing, and they count on you to do the right thing,” Ignatieff said. “Ethics provides community, so the key word in any moral operating system in a city is community. There’s no shortage of communities in L.A., the city is just a ‘confusion of communities,’ if that’s the word for a group of communities.”
These communities’ historic conflicts, such as the Watts Riots and Rodney King Riots, were used to investigate how cities build these “operating systems.”
Ignatieff sees these violent conflicts as expressions of issues between the many designers of the city’s “operating system,” showing the variety of people who write these ethical assumptions.
Despite these conflicts, Ignatieff is optimistic. His lecture expressed hope for increased diversity and non-violent restructuring of these “ethical operating systems.”
He also believes that these operating systems come from the common man, not from institutions, and represent individuality rather than homogeneity.
“Working together to rebuild a moral operating system cannot be achieved by abandoning authentic moral differences,” Ignatieff said. “What faith-based groups taught me is that common ground can be found so long as no one is asked to trade away what is distinct, authentic and real about their faith identity. Unlike the operating systems in machines that have to operate identically all the time, moral operating systems learn, adapt and change.”
Student reception to the lecture seemed positive. Yuna Kim, a junior majoring in international relations and biology, agreed with many of the points but felt that the optimism was misplaced.
“I thought it was very insightful,” Kim said. “But it was an optimistic view which I am skeptical of. I think he needs more time to develop proof.”
Jinny Cai, a junior majoring in health and humanity, found the discussion relevant to her studies.
“I think it’s very relevant to what I’m studying, actually,” Cai said. “I plan on going into the medical field and my ambition is to go into Doctors Without Borders, so it’s super interesting to me to know about all of these community issues, and the exchange between people. Many of the facts that he had about L.A. surprised me.”
Austin Carter, a junior majoring in economics (mathematics) and global health, focused on the L.A. element of the lecture.
“I think that in Global Health we deal with developing settings often, and a lot of the conversation was about Los Angeles, which I do think serves as a proxy for when you’re going into a developing place,” Carter said. “I thought that the speaker did a good job of highlighting the fact that L.A. is a place with a lot of great minds working on solutions.”

Students running for office in USG began online campaigning last night, marking the first implementation of USG’s revised elections code.
“We’ve been working on this for the past semester,” said Taylor Rottjakob, USG co-director for elections and recruitment. “All the candidates are going live on social media.”
At midnight, students began posting information about their USG campaign to Facebook, Twitter and other social media. Social media’s ever-increasing prevalence as a means of communication led to USG redesigning their election code to accommodate online campaigning.
“There is now a Campaign Part I [for social media], which never existed before,” said Olivia Diamond, director of communication.
In past years, USG campaigns began in February. The ambiguous wording of the past elections code made it easy for candidates to bend the rules and start campaigning before the determined date.
“There used to be a ‘research period’ where you could go around to clubs and other organizations on campus,” Diamond said. “You could ask questions like ‘what are you interested in on campus?’ but you couldn’t tell anyone you were running. It was kind of a gray area.”
USG believes that the new online campaigning period will reform the election process.
“It’s a different dynamic,” Diamond said of the new elections code. “There’s more transparency from the people who are running.”
An additional advantage of the revision is that candidates with limited economic means will now have equal opportunities to build a following around their campaigns.
“All of this digital publicity is free,” Diamond said. “Candidates still can put out hard media like signs or campaign posters during the last week and a half of campaigning, but these things are ultimately less important.”
Though candidates will be busy during the following weeks, USG’s Elections and Recruitment board will be just as busy monitoring their activity, making sure it conforms to the new election code.
“On our side, what we do is make sure they follow all the rules posted in the elections code,” Rottjakob said.

Following indie-rock band Young the Giant’s rather unremarkable and lackluster beginnings (except for a few noteworthy tracks) with their first studio album Young the Giant, is the group’s far superior follow-up album Mind Over Matter. The Orange County quintet known for its multicultural members comes back with an unexpected — but welcome — edge.
“It’s About Time” · Young the Giant transforms their sound on Mind Over Matter, which features a heavier style but keeps the band’s fun vibe. – Photo coutesy of Young the Giant
Their first studio album was filled with disappointment and a lack of a distinct sound. Some may say that their unconvincing vocals and fusion — or confusion — of rock and metal genres. The band’s ambitious efforts at success with Young the Giant came tumbling down on the rookie band with patchy tracks and mediocre lyrics with no obvious coherent theme. This time around, however, lead singer Sameer Gadhia makes more hits than misses consistently throughout the thirteen-track record, as the rest of the boys back him up with strong guitar riffs and dynamic instrumentals.
In addition, much more focus is put on thematic cohesion with lyrics and melodic instrumentals that are as enjoyable as they are memorable. The album’s title track reveals an underlying theme when Gadhia sings “And when the seasons change / Will you stand by me / ‘Cause I’m a young man built to fall.” The humble lyrics revolve around giving into industry pressure and consequent paralysis — a lesson learned from the group’s former endeavor.
Both album singles, “It’s About Time” and “Crystallized,” definitely take center stage in Mind Over Matter. “Crystallized” is surprisingly agressive. It begins with Gadhia screaming into the first verse over Francois Comtois’ rarely ceasing drumming in the background.
With the chorus of  “Crystallized” Sameer passionately sings “This is where I come from / This is where I belong / With the beat of your drum / Not any other,” and this track immediately sets the tone for where the album is going. It is a staple song. The song is also powerful and positive and carries hope for what’s to come in the band’s future.
Mind Over Matter takes on a much heavier rock, almost metal influence with intros comparable to that of Metallica or U2. It also offers something lighter and more fun that can be seen from the likes of the chorus for album-opener “Anagram.”
With Mind Over Matter, Young the Giant boldly takes advantage of each member’s musical talents. Comtois proves he is a force to be reckoned by consistently providing solid beats for every track, while Eric Cannata contributes to the albums synthetic vibes on the keyboard. Gadhia sings with a much more distinct and versatile range than before — the frontrunner also rocks out on the shaker in several selections, going back and forth between percussion and keyboard.
As the album plays on, however, the latter half is a bit more hit-or-miss where the problem of the amalgam of genres reappears ever so slightly. The later tracks seem to at once amass together and lose a little of what made “Crystallized,” opening track “Anagram” and the title track so appealing. Besides the mostly insignificant muddling of tempos that seemingly drags it on for a bit, this album packs a real punch that stands apart from other indie-rock groups.
The percussion-heavy intros of tracks by fellow indie-rock band Cage the Elephant and Alt-J tracks are also closely comparable to some mellower Mind Over Matter songs.
The Irvine, Calif.-based band formerly known as The Jakes, had humble beginnings before changing their name and signing with Roadrunner Records in 2009. Since the group’s debut as Young the Giant, the band lost a keyboardist and two drummers, contributing to the group’s rocky start.
With Mind Over Matter, Young the Giant is finally getting off on the right foot (although no longer under Roadrunner Records). Fueled By Ramen now represents the band that is confidently creating a niche for themselves in the high-pressure music industry. Listeners will be able to pick up on a difference between the indie-rock band’s debut album and Mind Over Matter.
Young the Giant has created a cohesive and relatable album fully clad with impressive and catchy tunes with synthy and hip instrumentals to match.
wow. I don’t think we heard the same album….Their first album was phenomenal, it had a unique and distinctive sound. I am a huge fan of this band but it hurts my heart to say that their latest album is a total disapointment. It sounds very meh…boring and just like any other average indie/pop/rock band with a hinch of coldplay wannabe sound. Apart from It’s about time and Mind over matter (which are decent) the rest of the album is a flop in my book. a 3/10.
agreed. also I have to ask, how is Crystallized “surprisingly aggressive”? Lol its like the pop-iest love songish single on the album… did this author even listen to it?
Doesnt seem like the author has even listened to the two albums, nor metal… comparing young the giant to metal? It has some fuzzy guitars, that does not make it metal. Theyre hardly even rock, let alone a fusion of metal and rock. Furthermore, their last album was not some kind of flop ( it gained them pretty widespread success, getting them onto talk shows/ the vmas etc) and this new album is definitely not some phoenix rebirth out of the ashes…
So many parts of this article are factually wrong. They lost a drummer ages before they debuted as young the giant, francois has been there since like 2007. And the keyboardist left not too long before signing to roadrunner, when they were still the jakes. Regardless, it certainly did not contribute to their supposedly “rocky” start

Upon encountering Man Soo Lee’s exhibit “Tune,”, museum-goers immediately think of beauty, elegance and simplicity. the latest collection sponsored by LA Artcore. A professor of oriental painting at Sungshin University in Seoul, Lee has created an astounding collection of work that stresses the point of the individual existence of man.
The specific Korean word for the exhibit “sanjo” actually means “scattered tune,” which offers more direction to the meaning of the works on display. Buildings and people scatter across the paintings, yet strangely remain independent of each other. No item is of particular importance, but they’re all something every viewer can identify with.
“I chose these items — a church, flowers, a man playing a game — because they are all things I encountered in my childhood in Korea,” Lee said. “They are all a part of my individual existence.”
Whether having this individual existence displayed in the canvas was good or bad was highly debated amongst the crowd of visitors. Some thought the painting spoke volumes to the lives we all lead in our modern society.
Visitors noticed that in “Tune1304,” one could see many people walking through a black and white garden. Each person is alone, one is even texting on his phone, so they don’t interact.
Everyone could agree, though, that these modern touches are what make “Tune” so relatable. Even in contemporary art, one would be hard-pressed to find a subject using his or her smartphone in the piece. The presence of these modern objects especially juxtaposes the simplicity of the background as well as the traditional Korean elements, such as the structure of some of the buildings. Even if a viewer has never been exposed to the Oriental style of painting, these elements allow them to still relate to the work.
One can’t help but marvel at the planning that must have been involved to make these paintings a reality, not to mention the patience this method requires. The process of creating each work is very meticulous, the smallest one taking an entire week. For each of the isolated items, Lee places stencils on the canvas then paints layer upon layer over them. Once the final layer dries, he peels away the stencils and paints them in.
Some of the stencils blend into the background, filled in with a similar shade, while others, which are meant to stand out, are painted in colors that contrast the layered paint.
One is drawn to the large pastel shapes encompassing most of the paintings — a teardrop or a circle, defined and embossed into the background through the layering technique. An overall favorite and a centerpiece to the collection reminds one of a beautiful sunrise due to the large burnt orange circle that lay at the center of the painting.
To create texture, Lee manipulates the paint with a brush, each stroke mimicking grass, and shaves away layers with sandpaper to represent dirt. These vital concepts of nature help the paintings to embody the ambiance of a Korean tea garden.
Elements like these allude to Lee’s background in Oriental Painting. The mastery of texture, the attention to detail speaks volumes to his experience — Lee has been an artist for more than twenty years.
Lee’s work has been displayed and celebrated throughout Korea, and contemporary art lovers worldwide have had the pleasure of viewing his work. His art has travelled the globe, from Australia to the United States, China to Angola. As is many artists’ dream, though, Lee has always wanted to show his work in cities such as Los Angeles and New York. With the aid of LA Artcore, this dream is now a reality.
This nonprofit organization helps many artists like Man Soo Lee expand their audience by providing a space to display their work. For Lee, this exposure has captured the attention of art collectors as far as Venice, Italy desiring to have a painting from this beautiful collection.
“Our job [is] to give artists the opportunity to show their work by providing host museums—such as the Union Center for the Arts—to hold their exhibitions,” said Lydia Takeshita, a coordinator at LA Artcore.
“Tune” manages to bring elegance and beauty out of simplicity in a way that is unparalleled by most.
 
“Tune134” is at the LA Artcore Union Center for the Arts in Little Tokyo until Jan. 31.

Happy Hump Day, foodies! On tap this week is a slew of scrumptious holidays that are sure to inspire you to get out and try them or go invade your local grocery store and fill your carts with sweet-smelling noms that will bring your friends from far and wide.

Monday, Jan. 20th, 2014: National Buttercrunch Day, National Cheese Lover’s Day 
Buttercrunch is just like it sounds — a crunchy, delicious morsel of crunch with butterscotch, caramel and sometimes even chocolate. Sort of like a Heath Bar, but better. Good enough to have its own holiday, in fact.
I like cheese. Growing up, I would have random childish outbursts of, “I like cheese! I like cheese,” which my mother found very bizarre, but she went with it (bless her heart); then I went through a period of lactose-intolerance, which was horrible, and now here I am feasting on all of the gorgonzola, pepper jack and sharp cheddar I could ever want. Even if you’re not a big lover of cheese, you have to appreciate what it has done for our world, such as the creation of American favorites mac ‘n’ cheese and the grilled cheese sandwich —just think about that.
Los Angeles is filled with fabulous specialty cheese shops. Unfortunately, they are not cheap, but in my opinion, they are worth every penny; if you’re a fan, many cheesemongers offer tasting events. On the West Side there is The Cheese Store of Beverly Hills and Andrew’s Cheese Shop, a hole-in-the-wall shop located in lovely Santa Monica. For all my hipsters out there, there is The Cheese Store of Silver Lake.
Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2014: New England Clam Chowder Day, National Granola Bar Day
If you are a New England Patriots fan, you can still celebrate a great season with a delicious and warm bowl of clam chowder, but sorry I’m not sorry for your loss. I had the privilege of trying authentic clam chowder in Cape Cod as a kid and boy, do I miss it. There is nothing better than smelling the sweet smell of the ocean and feeling the cool air while scarfing down a hot portion of clam chowder served in a warm sourdough bowl, but you can try some close competitors in Los Angeles such as the bowl at the L&E Oyster Bar in Silver Lake or enjoy the warm California beaches at Santa Monica Seafood.
Granola bars: the man-made invention to insert necessary fiber into every college student’s diet in order to prevent them from ever eating normal amounts of food. They’re delicious and they come in an assortment of flavors, but please don’t live off of them. Since they get their own holiday, I hereby give you permission to go nuts.
Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2014: National Blonde Brownie Day
As the saying goes, “Blondes have more fun,” but in this case, they have more sweets. Golden “blonde” brownies, or blondies, have pure brown sugar, butter and vanilla that create a caramelesque, butterscotchy flavor that nobody can resist.
Blondies are a super treat to tuck into lunch bags and are easy to make too, but in case you don’t want to make them and would rather go on an L.A. culinary brownie adventure to hit your sweet spot, I recommend Milk on Beverly Boulevard or Huckleberry Cafe & Bakery in Santa Monica.
Thursday, Jan. 23rd, 2014: National Rhubarb Pie Day
If you have a sweet tooth, you understand the importance of pie in your daily diet. Rhubarb pie is a classic flavor that is actually made from the very versatile vegetable rhubarb. Rhubarb has a bright red stalk and poisonous leaves and tastes very bitter when eaten raw; hence no one eats it raw. Some cultures use rhubarb as a vegetable in creating savory dishes, but in the United States, we boil it and add a ton of sugar to make toppings and fillings for desserts -— you can also make rhubarb chutney, flavored with ginger, orange zest, brown sugar and sultanas.
Though  there isn’t a place in Los Angeles that serves just rhubarb pie, there are many others that serve a variety perfect for any sweet tooth. Marcie’s Pies is known for its decadent strawberry rhubarb pie. Made with fresh ingredients that come from a fresh and organic farm, Marcie’s can only be found in local farmers markets such as the Sunday Hollywood Farmers Market. Other great places to get pie in Los Angeles include Urth Caffé in the Arts District and Philippe the Original’s Apple Pie.
Friday, Jan. 24, 2014: National Peanut Butter Day! Lobster Thermidor Day
National Peanut Butter Day falls almost exactly in the middle of National Peanut Month. Peanut butter is a snack, a dessert, a meal, a protein, a paste, a goop, a condiment and a solid. Those who are allergic live a sad life, and those who do not like peanut butter in any form whether it be in a Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are missing out on all the wonders that peanut butter creates. Eat responsibly.
Lobster thermidor is a French dish consisting of a creamy mixture of cooked lobster meat, egg yolks and cognac or brandy stuffed into a lobster shell that can also be served with an oven-browned Gruyere crust, with a mustard sauce. Due to expensive and extensive preparation, lobster thermidor is usually considered a recipe primarily for special occasions, but can be found in Los Angeles at the Hollywood Institution Musso & Frank’s.
Saturday, Jan. 25, 2014: National Irish Coffee Day
Irish coffee is a cocktail consisting of hot coffee, Irish whiskey and sugar, though some recipes specify that brown sugar should be used instead. The cocktail is stirred and topped with thick cream. The coffee is then consumed through the cream. The original recipe explicitly uses cream that has not been whipped, although drinks made with whipped cream are often sold as “Irish coffee.”
Tom Bergin’s is known in Los Angeles as the home of Irish coffee, conveniently located on the busy and bustling Fairfax Avenue, so you will want to plan ahead to make sure that you can get parking. Another great place to celebrate Irish Coffee Day is heading to O’Brien’s in Santa Monica. There, you have the option of choosing from a slew of sweet coffee beverages, or going for the classics.
Sunday, Jan. 26, 2014: National Pistachio Day
Pistachios are members of the cashew family, and are a great snack to eat at any time. They can be found in classic desserts such as baklava, or in the delicious pistachio ice cream, and come in an assortment of flavors. Like any nut, they can be seasoned to fit anyone’s fancy, but make sure to take off the shell.
Alegra’s recipe of the week:
“I always cook with wine. Sometimes, I even put it in the food.”
Baked Herb Lemon Chicken, By Andicakes
This is a recipe that hits close to home, and is ridiculously good. When made correctly with time and love, you will be enjoying a rich platter of succulent herb lemon chicken breast, that goes great on top of a pile of steamed or sautéed green beans in olive oil, lemon juice and balsamic vinegar for a excellent way to get both vegetables and protein or serve chicken on a pile of spaghetti, tossed in olive oil and balsamic vinegar for an affordable Friday night dinner. With my Italian heritage, I always like finding what I think are authentic recipes, and to be honest, the last time I made this dish, I was blasting Italian dinner music in my kitchen! I encourage you to try it – plus, gents, this is a great way to impress the ladies in your life!

First, prepare the chicken breasts by rinsing them and drying with a paper towel. Trim any excess fat from the breast and place in a 9 x 13 baking dish [skin] side up. Repeat with the remaining breasts. Sprinkle the breast with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. Now slice one lemon lengthwise into 6-8 wedges and set among the chicken breasts in the dish.
Next, add the extra virgin olive oil to a small sauté pan and heat over medium-low temperature, once warmed add the minced garlic and cook for just a minute stirring constantly. Turn the heat off and add the dry white wine, lemon zest, lemon juice, dried oregano, and minced thyme. Pour the warm mixture into the dish to surround the seasoned chicken breasts. Using a brush lightly brush the chicken breasts skins with the oil mixture so it will brown and crisp during baking and then add the 4 sprigs of thyme on top the chicken breasts.
Bake the dish uncovered for 30 to 45 minutes, until the breasts are cooked and reach 165 degrees F. Turn the oven to broil for 1-3 minutes and broil the dish if necessary to brown the skins on the breasts. Remove from the oven, cover with aluminum foil and allow resting for 10 minutes before serving.
Transfer the chicken to a serving platter and pour desired amount of cooking liquid onto the platter for service.

You might not know him by his name alone, but if you’ve ever browsed reddit or looked for plane tickets on Hipmunk, you’re at least familiar with the creations of Internet entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of social news site reddit, travel site Hipmunk and social enterprise platform Breadpig.
/r/Alexis · Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of popular social media website reddit, will be speaking at USC tonight as part of a Viterbi speaker series. – Photo courtesy of Alexis Ohanian
With the success that he’s seen from his ventures, Ohanian wrote Without Their Permission: How The 21st Century Will Be Made Not Managed, a book that discusses his own personal story as well as advice on how to start and — hopefully — expand a startup. Ohanian saw the Internet transform ideas and how just about anything could be brought to life through it (“All links are created equal,” is a continually-mentioned mantra in the book), Ohanian is also a strong Open Internet activist, having spoken out against Congress’s Stop Online Piracy Act and the Senate’s Protect IP Act in 2010 and 2011.
Even though Ohanian is currently on tour promoting his book, he still had the chance to chat with the Daily Trojan about his book, the Internet and his love of Star Wars.
 
Daily Trojan: In Without Their Permission, you mention how you started tinkering when you were younger. Was this something that you started doing, or were their influences in your life that encouraged this type of creativity?
Alexis Ohanian: My mother’s highest level of education was a GED and my dad got a degree in urban studies from a hippie school (Antioch) that lost its charter, so neither of them really understood the technology they brought home the day they bought me a computer. What they did know was to encourage me to tinker and explore computers and [the] Internet. They gave me total freedom, which allowed me to succeed (and fail) at learning a variety of things from hardware to programming.
 
DT: There is a section in your book where you mentioned that if you want to create, you should learn to code. When you were in high school, there weren’t as many resources available as we have now (i.e. CodeAcademy, RailsforZombies, etc.) How did you learn?
A.O.: Books, mostly. And I took the Pascal class my high school offered at least two times (I think I was a teacher’s aid for a third go-around) and my mom got me signed up for more programming classes at community college over the summers.
 
DT: How long did it take you to write Without Their Permission, and when did you decide to start writing?
A.O.: I wrote the book in bursts over a few months, stealing time when I could. What really helped was taking a week off, locking myself in a house with WiFi off and only my cat for distraction. I wrote most of the book in that week.
 
DT: From your experience, is it difficult to find people who “give a damn”? If not, why do you think that in other industries it might be hard to find people who give a damn?
A.O.: Yes. I think it’s hard everywhere, because taking pride in one’s work is not something we all get the chance to do in our professional lives. When everything aligns, though, and you’ve got a position at a company in an industry where someone can reach that kind of fulfillment, it’s a beautiful thing for all involved.
 
DT: Regarding a comment you made about the lack of technologists there are in politics, are you optimistic about the possibility of more tech-minded individuals in government? Why or why not?
A.O.: I’m optimistic because there are more and more tech-minded individuals coming up. Period. Some of them will naturally end up running for office. The sooner the better. Bring in the nerds!
 
DT: You said that some of your favorite subreddits are /r/explainlikeimfive and /r/corgi … what are your other favorite subreddits? (Note to reader: subreddits are like subcategories under reddit, usually formatted like /r/subject to indicate that it’s a subreddit)
A.O.: It’s always changing because there are so many [subreddits] created every day and so many I discover daily. I just found /r/syriancivilwar, which is a fascinating forum with a community aggregating links to news and primary sources. When I want to feel better about the world, I’ll check /r/upliftingnews/ or /r/aww. I just clicked the ‘random’ button and got /r/boardgames, which is pretty cool.
 
DT: From what’s in the book, you and Star Wars clearly have a history. How far do you go back?
A.O.: Growing up, I was a much bigger fan of the Aliens universe, but it’s harder to make references to LV-426 and expect a broad audience to understand it. I have a lot of respect for Star Trek and I know my book upset some people, but Star Wars was just more fun. I must’ve started in elementary school … no one ever forgets the first time they see a lightsaber.
 
DT: If a USC student has an idea, what’s the best way they can reach out to you?
A.O.: Twitter! I’m @AlexisOhanian and I try and reply to as much as I can, and plenty of opportunities have come off of there. The other place would be on my subreddit, /r/Alexis!
 
Alexis Ohanian will be speaking at USC as part of the Viterbi Student Institute for Innovation Speaker Series on Wednesday, Jan. 22 in SGM 123 at 7 p.m. Ohanian will also be joined onstage by USC Viterbi alumni entrepreneurs Ross Boucher and Tom Robinson for a Q&A.

Alabama State University prohibits its president, Gwendolyn Boyd, from having romantic partners cohabitate with her for the duration of her presidency, according to the Huffington Post. Though it makes sense that the Board of Trustees does not want an endless parade of suitors visiting Boyd at the Presidential House, this stipulation is an affront to Boyd’s personal liberty and an invasion of her privacy.
Just as the separation of church and state is an accepted practice in U.S. society, the distinction between personal and professional life should be respected. The nation’s preoccupation with public officials’ lives is detrimental and unnecessary. Instead of worrying about the official’s social life, the emphasis should be on his or her record of service and accomplishments. Romantic relationships should not be used to evaluate qualifications because they do not reflect professional decision-making capabilities.
Not only does the contract restrict Boyd’s personal life, it also promotes old-fashioned ideas about relationships and marriage. The contract, made publicly available by the Birmingham News, states, “For so long as Dr. Boyd is president and a single person, she shall not be allowed to cohabitate in the president’s residence with any person with whom she has a romantic relation.” The subtext of the contract hints that having a cohabiting partner is less meaningful than having a spouse.
The assumption that marriage guarantees a stable, healthy relationship is clearly ungrounded. According to The New York Times, roughly two-thirds of couples saw cohabitation as a step toward marriage. For others — most commonly gay couples who are prohibited from legal marriage in certain states — cohabitation is a long-term commitment and not a temporary fling. The university should not scrutinize Boyd’s romantic decisions nor hinge the value of a relationship on legal marriage.
Yet, one of the most disquieting aspects of Boyd’s contract is that the “love clause” is not too far out of the ordinary. Scott Miller, president of Bethany College in West Virginia and chairman of the board at Academic Search, told Inside Higher Ed that other university contracts contain provisions about the president’s values and behavior. Though the regulations in the Alabama State University’s contract are not the norm, “they reflect the increasing scrutiny that campus CEOs face as the chief image-makers — indeed, the living ‘brand’ — of the institutions that employ them.”
The “love clause” in the Alabama State University contract is more than an affront to Boyd’s autonomy — it exposes the unrealistic expectations placed on employees of large institutions. According to Alabama State University Spokesman Kenneth Mullinax, “this clause in our university’s contract has nothing to do with Dr. Boyd and everything to do with the increasing scrutiny that university presidents face.”
His statement is an acknowledgement that high-ranking public officials are often thought of as a “brand” and forced to promote the institution’s image. In order to improve its reputation, Alabama State University should focus on measurable results instead of emphasizing Boyd’s personal life.
Employers must respect the space between professional and personal and take care not to overstep this boundary by dictating how employees conduct their personal lives. Raymond Cotton, a Washington, D.C. lawyer, expressed his doubts about Boyd’s contract to Inside Higher Ed.
“I don’t know of any state that has the right to invade someone’s residence even if the state owns that residence,” Cotton said, citing Supreme Court cases that prevent government from interfering with employees’ personal lives.
On a more tangible level, it is unrealistic for the university to prohibit Boyd from having romantic guests stay overnight. As Cotton noted, continuous monitoring of Boyd’s private life is wasteful and uncalled for.
“How would you enforce it? Would you go marching into a president’s home and say, ‘Stop that, get your hands off him or her,’” Boyd told Inside Higher Ed. This statement further highlights the idea that the contract oversteps professional boundaries and infringes on Boyd’s personal liberty.
Even though employees should be in general agreement with the values of their workplace, they cannot be expected to fully embody the institution that they serve. In the same way that it is possible to appreciate a professor as a person while disagreeing with his teaching method, an individual is more than his or her career and it is unreasonable to expect anyone to be wholly devoted to promoting an institution’s image.

This post has been updated to show that Gwendolyn Boyd is the president of Alabama State University, not the University of Alabama as previously reported.
You need to fact check.  She is the President of Alabama State, not the University of Alabama.

She is the President of the University of Alabama.
This is incorrect, she is the President of Alabama State

Among other universities across the nation, USC halted its semester Monday to observe the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday that, after decades of lobbying, was finally approved as a federal holiday in 1986. Fittingly, a few days before the King holiday, and after seven years of discussion the University of California system announced a policy that will delay classes, pushing the start of the school year back one week to avoid the Jewish High Holidays, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
The UC’s recognition of religious holidays is a positive step in creating more inclusion in learning environments that are legally obligated to avoid taboo discussions of religion in school.
Of the 10 UC campuses, seven of them are on the quarter system and generally start classes on the last week of September — the same time during which the Jewish High Holidays are observed. During the 10 days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, observant Jews mark the holiday by spending time with family and limiting work.
Yet, despite the recent recognition given to Jewish students in an academic calendar that is historically structured around Christian holidays, students of other religions are not afforded the same privilege — even though they should be.
Last October, Muslim families in Maryland lobbied to make the Islamic holy day of Eid al-Adha a school holiday, according to the Washington Post. Advocates for the policy change reasoned that it put an unnecessary burden on observant students to miss school the day before the PSAT, a required standardized test given at school. In counties within the state, schools are closed for Christian holidays such as Christmas and Good Friday as well as the Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.
According to a report by the Freedom Forum, lower federal court decisions have determined that recognition of holidays might be constitutional if the purpose is to provide secular instruction about religious traditions. The recognition cannot promote the particular religion involved.
Because the Supreme Court has not ruled on this issue, there is no  definitive answer to the question of which religious holidays should be accommodated in the school calendar. In the 1993 ruling of Bridenbaugh v. O’Bannon, however, the Court stated that government institutions or public school systems could grant the day off on religious holidays if a secular reason is also provided. In the Maryland case, those supporting the accommodation argued that classes should be canceled because the school district has determined a high rate of absenteeism would occur regardless.
The UC system also factored the percentage of students possibly missing school into its decision to delay the semester because of Jewish High Holidays. In a 2010 University of California Undergraduate Experience Survey, the results showed that approximately 3 percent of UC students identified as Jewish. There are not exact numbers on how many students identify as Muslim in Maryland, but trends show that the Muslim community is growing, according to the Washington Post.
Federal and state laws prohibit schools from penalizing students for missing school on religious holidays. But in this ever-evolving inclusive U.S. culture, the status quo can go a step further.
Canceling classes for certain religions and not others implies that some religions have more impact than other ones. For these reasons, numbers should not be solely relied upon when discussing the sensitive topic of religion.
Tradition is not always telling either. Despite the fact that spring break often coincides with the Christian Easter holiday, not every student with a Christian background is going to spend those days off from school observing that holy day. Therefore, if there are groups of students and parents reaching out to school districts and showing them how their religious practices would be compromised by the stagnant academic calendar, it’s about time we start listening.
When school policymakers are cognizant of religious holidays that would lead students to be absent from school, the learning environment becomes more reflective of the world around us. Everyone loves to be recognized and respected, especially when it comes to religious expression. Though school systems have made steps to improve recognition of religion in some areas, their definition of religious impact should now begin to expand as well.

Jordyn has a wonderful idea! Every Buddhist, Hindu, Confucian, Muslim, Ba’al and other religious holiday should be observed as a national holiday! Then no one need attend school or work! What a happy holiday society we would become, everybody relaxing and attending religious services and festivals! Good thinking, Jordyn!

January is proving to be its own blockbuster month.
Just last week, the Afghan war drama Lone Survivor nearly broke Cloverfield’s January record of $40M. This week, Ride Along actually broke the record, with a $41.5M three-day opening and a massive $48.6M over the four-day MLK weekend, becoming the largest January opening.
The cop comedy, directed by USC alumnus Tim Story and starring Ice Cube and Kevin Hart, sold the comedic potential of pairing up the two actors. It goes to show that successfully playing up an actor’s persona — Ice Cube’s hard knocks attitude matched up to Kevin Hart’s hyperactive banter — will bring out their fanbases in droves. With good buzz in spite of the poor reviews, expect a strong run.
Lone Survivor continued to perform well. Although it came up short in Oscar nominations and is attempting to follow the format Zero Dark Thirty took last year, the broader and less political slant has allowed it to connect with audiences, earning the film $22.1M/$26M over the holiday weekend.
The Nut Job, a new animated film from Open Road Films, opened above expectations with $19.4M/$25.7M. It had poor reviews and looked cheap but it’s the first family-friendly option since Frozen. The Disney phenomenon continues to do exceptionally well, getting a bump over the weekend with $11.8M/$16.2M for a total of $336.7M. At this rate, it may eclipse Despicable Me 2 as the reigning animated film.
The latest Tom Clancy thriller Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, starring Chris Pine, wasn’t able to break out as much as the studio might have hoped. A reboot of the character previously played by Alec Baldwin, twice by Harrison Ford, and most recently by Ben Affleck, the film mustered a mediocre $15.5M/$18M.  Although the character has a long cinematic history, the film presented itself as a generic spy film with a character that arguably should be portrayed by an older actor.
The weekend’s bust was 20th Century Fox’s found footage horror film Devil’s Due, which opened with a paltry $8.3M/$9.1M. This is just two weeks after Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones failed to impress, showing that audiences may just not be into the found footage technique. To put it into perspective, last year was one of the best years for the horror genre (Mama, The Purge, The Conjuring), yet none of them were found footage features. It’s no longer authentic, and rather just looks cheap.
A few films also got some Oscar love over the weekend. American Hustle, which leads the crop of Best Picture nominees with ten nominations, increased over the previous weekend with $9.9M/$11.8M for a total of $117.6M. As long as that momentum continues, it could gross over $160M when all is said and done. August: Osage County, featuring Oscar-nominated roles for both Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep, also gained a boost while The Wolf of Wall Street and Her had soft drops.
Gravity and 12 Years A Slave, considered the other frontrunners for Best Picture, both returned to theaters and should regain traction. While 12 Years has grossed $41M so far and can only go up, Gravity has already been a phenomenal success with $258.7M. It’s due to come back to IMAX January 31st so there’s still some juice left.
It’s a healthy time at the theater, with a strong mix of new releases and award-winning flicks. Try to catch what you can while you can.
