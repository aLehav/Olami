USC will take another step in its season Friday with its first true away match at No. 15 Pepperdine.
Big weeekend · Junior Jaak Poldma was named Pac-10 Men’s Tennis Player of the Week after the third-year won two doubles matches and two singles matches at the ITA National Indoor Championships last weekend. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
This match marks the beginning of a stretch where the Trojans will play four of their next five matches on the road.
The recent ITA National Team Indoor Championships in Virginia marked a transition in the No. 5 USC men’s tennis team’s (8-1, 0-0) season. The tournament was the first match the Trojans played away from the friendly confines of Marks Stadium this season.
The Waves (3-2, 0-0) have started the season playing some highly ranked opponents on the road, losing to No. 6 UCLA and No. 3 Ohio State, while beating Michigan.
The Pepperdine lineup consists of two ranked singles players and one ranked doubles team, and its experience this year has prepared them well for USC.
“Having played Ohio State and UCLA already, that’s the level of opponent we’re going to see on Friday,” Pepperdine coach Adam Steinberg told the Waves’ official website. “We played really well in those matches and at home. I think we have the team that can compete with anybody.”
Although the Trojans’ ranking dropped from No. 1 to No. 5 in the most recent collegiate rankings following the Indoor Championships, the Trojans are also coming into the match feeling good about the way they are playing tennis.
“We have played some high-level matches, which helps our confidence and match rhythm,” senior Robert Farah said.
Doubles play and healing from injuries remain areas where the Trojans would like to improve. The team will continue to monitor sophomore Steve Johnson’s back injury, which is not anticipated to be a problem against Pepperdine, but has affected both his play and the team’s doubles lineup at times this season.
Junior Jaak Poldma received some more good news after his exceptional play at the Indoor Championships.
After being recognized by the USC Credit Union as the USC Student-Athlete of the Week, Poldma was named the Pac-10 Men’s Tennis Player of the Week — the first time he has obtained this honor.
As the away matches commence, team members said they understand what it will take to achieve success away from campus.
“Our goal is to stay focused and keep our sense of urgency,” Farah said.
As the season continues to progress, the sense of a competitive fire on the court is crucial as the Trojans get a better handle on the team’s overall health.
“The season is off [to a good start], we just need to have everyone healthy and ready to go,” Smith said.

Coming off an uneven effort against No. 7 Loyola Marymount, the No. 2 USC women’s water polo team will visit No. 11 UC Irvine for a non-conference matchup.
Despite the decisive 9-2 victory last weekend, the Women of Troy (5-1, 0-0) struggled in the first half, only leading 3-2 before the break.
The Anteaters (5-3, 0-0) — like most opponents the team will face — are underdogs in this matchup, which is not to say that won’t pose a challenge to the Women of Troy.
The Women of Troy hold a 13-6 all-time record against their former Mountain Sports Pacific Conference rivals. The Anteaters feature senior Kat Plummer, who earned the Big West Player of the Week honors for her five goals in the teams last two games. The Anteaters are a well balanced team led by Caitlin Haskell on offense who has 13 goals on the season, while featuring a duo of goalies that have helped the Anteaters to a winning record.
Standout USC goalkeeper senior Tumua Anae reflected on the team’s sluggish start against LMU and how she and her teammates plan to prepare for this game.
“Against LMU, we didn’t have the proper mind-set and focus,” Anae said. “On Saturday, from the moment we wake up until the game ends, we need to focus.”
Anae also stressed the pregame stretch and meeting as times to block out any extraneous thoughts.
While on paper the Women of Troy are heavily favored to win the game, they know better than to assume victory. For most teams that have won games as convincingly as they have, it is natural to become complacent.
“It’s easy to get excited for big [conference] games, but this game gives us an opportunity to focus on remembering our goal of winning a national championship,” Anae said.
As the offense remains potent, the Women of Troy will turn their focus toward improving their defensive effort against the Anteaters.
Better shot selection will also help them avoid another lackluster start. This game offers the team a glimpse at the venue of next weekend’s UC Irvine Invitational — the biggest tournament remaining before the postseason. The team hopes to continue its winning ways before facing one of its toughest challenges this season.

This time of year it is not uncommon to hear the phrase “Absence makes the heart grow fonder.”
Unfortunately, someone forgot to tell that to the No. 3 USC men’s volleyball team (7-4, 5-3) as it returned to the friendly confines of the Galen Center last Friday with a clunk.
One would assume the team would be happy to return home, after spending the entire month of February on the road. However, the Trojans were routed by the No. 7 Pepperdine Waves in three unimpressive sets (30-28, 30-28, and 30-26), leaving the one-time No. 1 team searching for answers to their newfound woes.
“The team has been able to battle through some tough challenges over the last week,” senior middle blocker Hunter Current said. “With that, there is a renewed energy and confidence that we are ready to compete again.”
Thanks to quirky schedule makers, who in a few short months have made the Trojans the road warriors of collegiate sports, the team will have a chance to mend its bruised heart with back-to-back home games this weekend against two Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference foes: Pacific (6-10, 0-10) and No. 2 Stanford (7-3, 6-3).
Friday night’s 7 p.m. tilt against the Tigers of Pacific University is subtly one of the most important matches USC will face all season. The Tigers are at the bottom of the MPSF, have yet to win a conference game and are fragile to say the least, and the Trojans are in desperate need of a morale boost after dropping three of their past four matches.
This season, Pacific is led by Serbian sensation and freshman middle blocker Nikola Vukicevic, not to be confused with USC men’s basketball big man, Nikola Vucevic. The freshman star from Belgrade is second on the team in kills per set (2.33) while also hitting at an efficient rate of .426.
Although the Tigers lack the fire power compared to other teams USC has faced, like Pepperdine, Cal State Northridge and UC Irvine, the Tigers started the season 4-0 en route to a top-10 standing throughout the first month of competition. Since its hot start however, the team has fallen on hard times, losing 10 of their previous 12 matches, with seven of the losses coming by way of a three-set sweep.
If Friday night’s match is the tune-up game of the weekend for USC, Saturday afternoon’s clash with the No. 2 Cardinal is far and away the premiere showcase. While USC is limping into this weekend, searching for answers after the recent slump, the Cardinal are in the midst of a season-best four-match winning streak.
Led by reigning National Player of the Week sophomore outside hitter Brad Lawson, Stanford heads into Saturday’s match looking like the team more apt to make a run at an NCAA title. Lawson, who leads the team in kills per set (4.91) and service aces (16), is joined by senior leader and fellow opposite hitter, Evan Romero, who last year set the school record for most kills in a season.
After wins against perennial powerhouses UCLA and UC Irvine last weekend, a 4 p.m. showdown at the Galen Center with the Trojans is well worth the price of admission — which for students is free with a school I.D.
For Bill Ferguson and the Trojans, the key to repairing the damage of last week’s embarrassing loss to Pepperdine is playing with the same heart and passion the team displayed so effortlessly while atop the nation’s standings just weeks earlier. While the team has found success this season as a unit, in order to regain the stride and swagger necessary to get back to the NCAA Final, junior team leaders opposite hitter Murphy Troy (4.05 kills per game), setter Riley McKibbin (552 assists this season) and middle blocker Austin Zahn (.460 hitting percentage this season) will need to do just that during this weekend’s home stand: lead.
If the Trojans fail to regain that sense of leadership, résumé-boosting matches like the ones they will face this weekend will go in a bad direction and a once-promising season has the potential to follow suit.
“As a senior, I would say this team has experienced worse problems than losing three of past four games,” Current said. “We are fortunate to experience some valuable ‘downs’ this early in the season, ultimately helping us to peak at the right time.”
Stanford is so much better in serve receiption then USC.. It’s going to be an ugly match for the Trojans.  Stanford will sweep.

It has been a rough year for the USC men’s basketball team.
Yes, you probably know this by now.
But when one considers the magnitude of the seemingly never-ending pile-up of sanctions, ineligibilities, injuries, and coaching and staff changes — not to mention the pending NCAA investigation that has loomed over the program for a year now — the phrase bears repeating, maybe even a couple times over.
At a time of major transition for the program, the team faces obstacles large enough to ruin a team’s chances of success for the next decade. Playing without a big name recruit (all of those disappeared before former coach Tim Floyd’s dust cloud settled), without a returning group of experienced players (or a coach, for that matter) and without any possibility of participating in the postseason, it is safe to say that the odds are against the Trojans in just about every way imaginable.
At this point, all of this news has just about become common knowledge to USC fans, which might explain why the average attendance at games has dwindled to below 5,000. Some may attribute this low turnout to one thing or another in specific, but it is safe to say that the myriad problems the team has had in the past year encapsulate most fans for apathy.
Yet in the wake of scandal and upheaval, there is a silver — or more appropriately, gold — lining to be found in this situation, one that has rarely shown itself in the past: a strong, bustling student section.
Against all reason, the problems facing the basketball team have seemed to bring out the best in our students, who as of late have continued to fill seats and support the basketball team despite waning attendance in the rest of the stadium. While it still has a long way to go before being linked with the likes of the “Cameron Crazies” at Duke or the “Izzone” at Michigan State, it’s apparent that strides are being made and students are once again providing the energy level needed to give the home team an added boost.
One could argue that it all began with the creation of the Trojan Fever Fanatics, a 20-or-so member group of “super fans” that sit in the first couple of rows in the student section and lead cheers. They have worked with coach Kevin O’Neill and others to bring incentive and excitement to games and are slowly but surely are becoming a familiar group throughout campus.
Others may point to the team’s history as a reason for student involvement, as the Trojans have garnered national attention in each of the last four seasons because of their postseason success and participation in the NCAA tournament, which included a Sweet 16 appearance in 2007. The success of the team alone in the recent past undoubtedly has captured the interest of numerous students.
But while these may be contributing factors, I see a third, much more intangible reason as the catalyst for the steady turnout: more than ever before, the students feel a connection with the players.
Let me explain.
Not in recent memory, and maybe not ever, has the team gone through such a sweeping change as what occurred last summer when Floyd and his recruits scattered and three players declared for the NBA draft. Going into this season, only one starter remained — senior guard Dwight Lewis — and the team seemed more concerned with just finding five starters to play than actually winning ball games.
But with the addition of transfers senior guard Mike Gerrity and redshirt junior foward Alex Stepheson, as well as the astounding progression and growth of sophomore foward Nikola Vucevic, forward senior Marcus Johnson and junior guard Marcus Simmons, the Trojans were suddenly a team of scrappy underdogs set on exceeding the minimal expectations set for them (USC was projected by Yahoo! to finish ninth in the Pac-10).
This team is a far cry from those seen in previous years, which were headlined by one-and-done players like DeMar DeRozan and O.J. Mayo. This team does not have national hype, years of experience, and the luxury of a veteran coach or a strong recruiting class to rely on, not to mention the privilege of playing in the postseason. They are not superstars or players whom you have heard of since they were in ninth grade.
But what they do have is the drive to compete under even the most unfair of circumstances; when most teams would roll over and look to next season, this Trojans team has gone 16-9 — a record that includes wins over Tennessee, UNLV and St. Mary’s out of conference — and suddenly finds itself a game and a half out of first place in the Pac-10.
And it is in this fierce and competitive spirit that the students have, in my opinion, bought into.
Sure, it’s easy to pack the student section when O.J. Mayo is taking the ball across court every possession. But to do it with a team of underdogs who can’t even play in the postseason is both a testament to the team’s love for the game and the students’ appreciation for unconditional school spirit and a never-say-die attitude.
So despite the unavoidable March 6 end to the Trojans’ year of basketball, the season will remain memorable — not because of the missed opportunities but rather because of what was accomplished in their wake.

The game wasn’t pretty and neither was the outcome.
The Women of Troy (13-11, 7-6) dropped their fifth consecutive game, this time losing to the Washington Cougars (7-18, 2-12) at the Galen Center, 64-52, spoiling the home debut of redshirt junior guard Jacki Gemelos.
“We started the game off strong, but if you don’t play with some enthusiasm and some determination, then you’re going to get beat,” USC coach Michael Cooper said.
Not only did Gemelos make her Galen Center debut, but another noticeable lineup change for the Women of Troy was freshman forward Christina Marinacci replacing starting senior guard Hailey Dunham.
“We wanted to get bigger,” Cooper said. “I think Christina did a good job of going to the boards, and she set the tempo early for us.”
In the first half, defense reigned supreme as both teams struggled to put the ball in the basket.
The Washington State Cougars shot just under 40 percent, but the Women of Troy managed to outdo their opponents by shooting a shade under 30 percent.
The Women of Troy jumped out to an early nine-point lead, limiting the Cougars to one shot on offense, while also giving themselves plenty of opportunities on the offensive end.
Even though the Women of Troy managed to control the glass, they missed second and third chance opportunities on the offensive end and 14 first-half turnovers allowed the Cougars to hang around and take a three-point lead into halftime.
One bright spot for the Women of Troy during the first half was when Gemelos stepped onto the Galen Center court for the first time in her USC career.
And she would immediately make an impact.
Gemelos grabbed a defensive rebound, dribbled to half-court and zipped a no-look pass through the Cougars defense to junior center Kari LaPlante.
“It felt good,” Gemelos said. “I’m just playing basketball.”
The second half was no different as both teams engaged in a defensive struggle.
The Women of Troy managed to tie the score four different times early in the second half but were never able to take the lead, and they continued to struggle from the field.
“It’s up to us to knock down open shots because we got every shot we wanted,” Gemelos said. “We just didn’t knock them down.”
For the rest of the game, the Cougars managed to stay ahead and pull away from the Women of Troy in the end to get their second win in conference play.
“I don’t think the energy was there tonight,” Gemelos said. “We better bring it Saturday night because this losing streak is getting old fast.”
Senior guard/forward Aarika Hughes managed to grab 11 rebounds to lead the Women of Troy in the rebounding department.
The Cougars were led by freshman guard KiKi Moore, who scored 19 points and grabbed nine rebounds, and sophomore guard April Cook, who chipped in 18 points.
Up next for the Women of Troy is a matchup with the Washington Huskies Saturday night at the Galen Center.
“I expect us to play with a lot more tempo,” Marinacci said. “All of us are sick of losing, and we can play a lot better.”
Tip-off is scheduled for 8 p.m.
Hooray for Jacki G. — truly an inspiring sports story for the ages.  The kid is other-worldly on the court and she is finally gettng her chance to be out there.  You go girl!
But what in the world is the matter with Michael Cooper and the coaching staff?  They have robbed this team of heart and passion. Say what you want about Mark Trakh, but he knew how to get players to play for him.  Cooper doesn’t appear to give a F (pun intended), and it has rubbed off on the program.  I predict he will be gone after next year.

Playing in a stadium packed with hostile fans, the USC men’s basketball team did what only one other team has done this season — defeat Washington on the road.
After leading by as many as 16 in the second half, the Trojans (16-9, 8-7) weathered a furious rally by the Huskies and held on to win, 67-64, Thursday night at the Bank of America Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion in Seattle.
With one minute left to play and USC clinging to a 61-60 lead after Washington guard Venoy Overton’s driving layup, redshirt senior guard Mike Gerrity slashed to the hoop for a layup of his own, putting the Trojans back up by three.
But that wasn’t his biggest shot of the game. Just moments later, Gerrity came back to drain a fadeaway jumper and effectively sealed the game for USC with just 16 seconds remaining. Senior guard Dwight Lewis sank two free throws, and the Trojans celebrated their first win at Washington in two years.
It was only the second home loss of the season for the Huskies (17-9, 7-7), who had entered the game with a 16-1 record at the Bank of America Arena. It also happened to be USC’s second road victory — the Trojans came into the game with a 1-6 record away from the Galen Center. The win moves USC into a tie for second place in the Pac-10 with Arizona State – and only a half game behind conference leader California.
By beating the Huskies on their homecourt, the Trojans proved their 87-61 rout of Washington on Jan. 23 wasn’t a fluke. USC’s size and athleticism gave the Huskies, who came in averaging 81 points a game on offense, trouble for most of the game.
With 9:49 left in the game, Gerrity’s layup gave USC a 52-36 lead, and the Huskies looked to be folding early. But Washington proceeded to score on three straight possessions and went on a 24-9 run capped by Overton’s layup.
The Huskies couldn’t finish what they started though. At the end of the game, USC made the key baskets.
Lewis had 22 points on 9 of 17 shooting from the floor. Sophomore forward Nikola Vucevic added 13 points and nine rebounds, and Gerrity finished with 12 points. USC shot 47 percent from the field and had a successful showing at the free-throw line, where the Trojans went 12 of 14.
For Washington, forward Quincy Pondexter scored 18 points. Forward Matthew Bryan-Amaning had 14 points.
USC led 32-24 at halftime. Washington’s high-powered offense looked to be in good form early on, with guard Abdul Gaddy’s jumper putting the Huskies up 8-2 less than three minutes in. But shortly thereafter, USC’s defense came to life and the pace slowed down. The Trojans took advantage, going on a 24-9 run to take a 26-17 lead five minutes before the break.
Lewis scored 12 of USC’s final 18 points to end the first half. Trojans forced nine turnovers and limited Washington to just 39 percent from the field in the first 20 minutes of play.
USC won’t have much time to rest. The Trojans now travel to Pullman, Wash., to take on Washington State on Saturday.
Tip-off is scheduled for 2 p.m.

Longtime Major League Baseball Executive Harry Dalton once said one of the greatest things about baseball was that hope rises each spring.
Moving on up · Sophomore righthander Chad Smith will start Saturday’s game against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Smith was a weekday starter a year ago, going 3-4 with a 3.40 ERA in four starts and 18 appearances.  - Daily Trojan file photo 
“You have the annual rebirth no matter how disastrous the previous year was,” he said.
USC hopes Dalton’s words ring true.
The Trojans are trying to make this year the rebirth of their program as a national powerhouse. The 12-time national champions have gone four years without a winning season, the longest such streak in program history.
Fourth-year USC coach Chad Kreuter is optimistic this team can turn it around as the season opens today with a three-game series at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.
“They’re a very formidable opponent,” Kreuter said of the Mustangs, who appeared in the NCAA regionals a year ago. “And we won’t take them lightly.”
Kreuter’s team lost a lot of talent following last season when a number of key players left in the 2009 MLB draft.
Two key Trojans were selected in the first 70 picks of the draft: One was ace Brad Boxberger, who paced last year’s rotation with a team-leading six wins.
Another was Robert Stock, who played a wide variety of roles for USC last year. He served as a catcher and designated hitter. He drove in 30 runs and hit six home runs, the second-highest total on the squad.
Stock also pitched over 77 innings last season. He began the year as the team’s closer and eventually moved into the weekend rotation, finishing with five wins, four saves and a 2.90 ERA.
To overcome those losses, Kreuter relies on what he calls a “conglomerate” of leaders on his roster to keep the team at an even keel.
“There’s a bunch of different guys that we feel can lead us,” Kreuter said. “I feel like we have a more well-rounded club, leadership-wise, than we’ve ever had in the past.”
USC should also be strong on the bump in 2010. The staff includes nine returning pitchers from last year’s squad and a solid class of newcomers.
All three weekend starters are familiar faces.
Sophomore Andrew Triggs will assume the top spot in the rotation after going 5-3 with a 3.96 ERA last season. Fellow sophomore Chad Smith (3-4, 3.40 ERA) and senior Kevin Couture (3-3, 5.66) will join Triggs in the weekend rotation.
Sophomores Ben Mount and Jordan Hershiser, who is returning from Tommy John surgery, could also vie for starts.
Transfer relievers senior Shuhei Fujiya and junior Brett Williams will bolster the staff. Fujiya had nine saves for Northern Iowa last season before the school disbanded its baseball program.
“We have great weekend guys, and a number of pitchers,” Kreuter said. “It just gives us a lot of depth that we need in the staff.”
And Kreuter has the option of using a number of two-way players, including sophomores Alex Sherrod and Brandon Garcia and freshman Richard Stock, Robert’s younger brother.
But USC’s biggest questions heading into the season come at the plate.
The Trojans lost Grant Green, their best hitter in 2009, to the draft. He was selected 13th overall and took his .374 average, 16 stolen bases and 19 extra-base hits — all team-leading totals — with him.
USC will turn to talented sophomore transfer Taylor Wrenn to fill that void. Wrenn had a life-threatening allergic reaction to medication he was taking in January and fell into a coma for three days. He emerged from the situation alive and will miraculously start today.
USC also hopes another sophomore, Ricky Oropesa, can provide the team with power. The Etiwanda High School product led the squad last season with 13 home runs and drove in 48 runs on his way to a  Louisville Slugger Freshman All-American and Pac-10 honorable mention honors.
He will be joined in the lineup by a number of returning players. Senior outfielder Mike O’Neill and senior catcher Keith Castillo provide the Trojans with veteran leadership in the field.
But USC must also contend with a stacked conference. The Trojans were picked to finish eighth in the Pac-10 and will play games against No. 8 UC Irvine, No. 14 Arizona State, No. 23 UCLA and No. 25 Oregon State.
The Trojans have a number of obstacles to climb, but if they can reach Omaha, Neb., they will get one last look at Rosenblatt Stadium, a stadium they have been to time and again.
