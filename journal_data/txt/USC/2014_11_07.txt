After a couple of down weeks, Week 11 is filled with potential playoff-elimination games, as the committee now looks to narrow down the playoff field.
#14 Ohio State (7-1, 4-0 Big Ten) at #8 Michigan State (7-1, 4-0 Big Ten)
The Buckeyes and the Spartans have both bounced back from tough early losses, setting up a likely playoff elimination game at the site of College GameDay, as the winner has a clear path to the Big Ten Championship and a possible playoff spot. After a tough loss early in the year to Virginia Tech, Ohio State quarterback J.T. Barrett (2352 total yards, 29 total TDs, 7 INTs) has done an excellent job of replacing the injured Braxton Miller, leading the Buckeyes to the 4th-best offense in the nation (45.6 points per game).
Meanwhile, the Spartans, who are right behind the Buckeyes on offense with 45.5 points per game, is led by quarterback Connor Cook (1868 yards, 17 TDs, 5 INTs) and running back Jeremy Langford (841 yards, 10 TDs). Michigan State has played extremely well, outside of their second half early this season against Oregon, while the Buckeyes encountered a road bump last week against Penn State. Considering the playmakers on the Spartans’ sideline, last week’s performance, and the fact the game is in East Lansing on a national stage, I’ll go with Michigan State for the second year in a row.
Prediction: Michigan State 31, Ohio State 28
#4 Oregon (8-1, 5-1 Pac-12) at #17 Utah (6-2, 3-2 Pac-12)
After snagging the final spot in the Top 4, the Ducks will look to maintain and improve their playoff seeding against a Utes squad coming off a heartbreaking 19-16 overtime loss to ASU. The Ducks’ offense, led by quarterback Marcus Mariota (2977 total yards, 34 total TDs, 2 INTs) and running back Royce Freeman (943 total yards, 13 total TDs), has been picking up steam, as evidenced by putting up 45 points against a Stanford team that hadn’t given up more than 30 in their previous 31 games. The Utes have similar strengths as Stanford, such as a strong defensive line, but have the advantage at running back with Devontae Booker (1091 total yards, 9 TDs), along with special teams with kicker Andy Phillips and returned Kaelin Clay.
Regardless, I expect more of the same of the Ducks, as they’ll put up plenty of points to clinch the Pac-12 North and try and earn a playoff berth.
Prediction: Oregon 42, Utah 31
#10 Notre Dame (7-1) at #9 Arizona State (7-1, 5-1 Pac-12)
The Fighting Irish will take on the Sun Devils in what is expected to be another high-stakes game, as the loser is most likely eliminated from earning a spot in the college football playoff. The Irish have struggled recently on defense, giving up a combined 113 points in their last three games against North Carolina, Florida State, and Navy, but have gotten enough production out of quarterback Everett Golson (2583 total yards, 29 total TDs, 7 INTs) to come 2-1 in that stretch.
Meanwhile, the Sun Devils appear to be in command of the Pac-12 South after a 19-16 OT win over Utah, and a win against the Irish would likely push them just outside the playoff picture. Arizona State has become a team of destiny, with a Hail Mary win against USC and winning a battle of the kickers last weekend against Andy Phillips, one of the best kickers in college football. Head coach Todd Graham’s squad has bounced back nicely from a 62-27 loss earlier this season against UCLA and, behind the playmaking ability of running back D.J Foster (1153 total yards, 8 total TDs) and wide receiver Jaelen Strong (821 yards, 8 TDs), should be able to squeak out a win against a Notre Dame team trending in the wrong direction.
Prediction: Arizona State 38, Notre Dame 34
#5 Alabama (7-1, 4-1 SEC) at #16 LSU (7-2, 3-2 SEC)
Nick Saban makes another return to Death Valley, as the Crimson Tide and the Tigers will look to keep themselves alive in the crowded SEC West. The Tigers are coming off a 10-7 upset of Ole Miss last week, but the Tide will present a whole other challenge for Les Miles. The Tigers have relied on Leonard Fournette (657 yards, 7 TDs) and their running game for most of the year, anda will be tested against an Alabama defense that is second in scoring with 10.5 points per game, and has yet to give up a 100-yard rusher this season. Meanwhile, the Tide will counter with their two-headed attack of T.J. Yeldon (618 yards, 5 TDs) and Darick Henry (530 yards, 4 TDs).
The game will likely come out to the quarterback position, where there is a big gap between Alabama’s Blake Sims (2284 total yards, 20 TDs, 3 INTs) and LSU’s Anthony Jennings (1190 yards, 8 TDs, 5 INTs). Sims can cause more problems both with his arm and his legs, and also has the best receiver in the country in Amari Cooper (1132 yards, 9 TDs), and is less mistake-prone than Ole Miss’s Bo Wallace. Unless Jennings proves he can beat the Tide with his arm, this one should be going to Alabama.
Prediction: Alabama 24, LSU 17
#7 Kansas State (7-1, 5-0 Big 12) at #6 TCU (7-1, 4-1 Big 12)
The Horned Frogs will host the Wildcats in what is expected to be their biggest test in getting a spot in the inaugural playoffs. TCU, led by quarterback Trevone Boykin (2895 total yards, 26 total TDs, 4 INTs), has the 2nd-best offense in the country with 48 points per game, and has emerged as a favorite to be the Big 12’s representative in the College Football Playoff.
Unfortunately, the Wildcats, led by coach Bill Snyder, quarterback Jake Waters (2282 total yards, 18 TDs, 3 INTs), and running back Charles Jones (431 yards, 11 TDs), are another tough opponent, and one that plays hard every down and makes very few mistakes. Meanwhile, the Horned Frogs have had their mental hiccups their past few weeks, and while they’ve gotten away with it in previous games, they won’t be able to bounce back from them against a well-coached Kansas State squad, and it could cost them in this game.
Prediction: Kansas State 31, TCU 28
#12 Baylor (7-1, 4-1 Big 12) at #15 Oklahoma (6-2, 3-2 Big 12)
The Bears will look to take their top-ranked offense (50.4 points per game) to Norman to take on the Sooners, who are essentially now playing the role of spoiler. The combination of running back Samaje Perine (767 yards, 11 TDs) and wide receiver Sterling Shepard (957 yards, 5 TDs) has provided the bulk of the offense for the Sooners, while Baylor, led by quarterback Bryce Petty (2145 total yards, 23 total TDs, 3 INTs), as a lot of talent at skill positions, headlined by running back Shock Linwood (777 yards, 10 TDs).
The Sooners have yet to beat a ranked team this year and, despite all of the talent on their roster, don’t have the firepower to keep up with Baylor. The defense should be able to keep this one close, but the Bears have an advantage at quarterback with Petty, and their explosive offense should be able to put up enough points to keep themselves as a dark horse contender for the playoffs.
Prediction: Baylor 38, Oklahoma 31
Playoff Prediction:
#1 Mississippi State vs. #4 Oregon
#2 Florida State vs. #3 Auburn
I don’t expect any major changes in the playoff picture this week, as most of the matches impact teams looking into the bracket. Mississippi State and Florida State should be able to coast to another win against UT Martin and Virginia, respectively, while Auburn faces Texas A&M at home, which has lost three of their last four, with their only win coming against a lowly-UL Monroe team last week by five points. Oregon should put up enough points to escape Utah with a win.

Former President Bill Clinton spoke to a capacity crowd in Bovard Auditorium Friday evening on a variety of topics ranging from U.S. foreign policy to the experience of being a grandfather.
Attendees included California Senator Barbara Boxer and Texas Governor-Elect Greg Abbott.
The event began with opening remarks from USC President C.L. Max Nikias before moving into an address from Clinton himself. Following Clinton’s remarks, James Ellis, dean of the Marshall School of Business, moderated a discussion with the 42nd president.
“It is clear that, throughout his extraordinary life, President Clinton has sought to understand -— and even befriend — the changes of our time,” Nikias said in his opening statement.
Nikias said that “national borders were giving way to an increasingly globalized world,” and Clinton began by stressing the importance of having a framework in order to evaluate global news in context.
“It’s very easy to confuse the headlines [with] the trend lines, and whether they are really representative of what’s going in the world,” Clinton said.
One of the trend lines, according to Clinton, was the issue of interdependence. The former president’s discussion was framed with an emphasis on issues facing communities and cooperation.
“The fundamental reality of the world we live in and the world we’re moving towards is interdependence, and it will only increase,” he said. “Interdependence can be good or bad or — human nature being what it is — it can be both, but divorce is not an option.”
Clinton discussed the two-edged nature of technology and its role in the new, interdependent world.
“The Internet has done a great deal of good. It’s made it possible for an 8-year-old to get on the Internet and find out in 30 seconds what I had to go to college for,” Clinton said. “It’s also made it possible for social networking sites to not only do great good but also recruit new members for ISIS.”
Clinton emphasized the need for “networks of creative cooperation,” citing several examples of regions in the United States, such as San Diego and Orlando, Florida, where collaboration between industry and universities had created economic growth in the biotechnology and computer simulation fields, respectively.
He spoke to the importance of systems and how, in many poor nations, the lack of adequate systems made it difficult to respond to crises such as disease outbreaks. He said that even wealthy nations such as the U.S. need to constantly upgrade and improve systems, and that the United States needs to reform its immigration, corporate tax and infrastructure systems in order to remain globally competitive. He cited an example of developing wind power and other renewable energy sources.
“By and large in America, even when the politicians aren’t talking, the wind blows,” he said.
Still, Clinton remained optimistic about the future of the United States over the next 20 years, arguing that the United States was in the best position among developed nations.
“There will be bad headlines, but you can keep the trend lines positive,” he said in his closing lines.
During the question and answer portion of the event, Ellis began by asking how interdependence can apply to “political hotspots” such as Russia, Syria, Ukraine and Hong Kong. Clinton said that it was important to evaluate things in context and that it was not always possible for the U.S. to intervene.
He talked about the democratic uprisings in Hong Kong and said the United States should “pull for democracy” while understanding the limitations due to the relationship between the United States and China. Clinton underlined the importance of using discretion before intervening.
“In international affairs, when you see a problem, you have to ask yourself if the problem is a toothache, a scab or a bad knee,” Clinton said. “If it’s a scab you have to leave it alone because it’ll work itself out; you scratch, it’ll make it worse.”
The conversation then shifted to the domestic front, and Ellis asked Clinton what the next two years would like look with a Democratic president and Republican-controlled legislature, a structure which characterized much of Clinton’s presidency.
Clinton said that there would be a “Kabuki dance” between the Republicans and Obama during the next few months as they tried to determine what the other side would do. He said a telling decision would be whether the Republicans attempt to repeal sections of the Affordable Care Act that are demonstrably working. He cited the examples of Arkansas and Kentucky, Republican states where the Democratic governors have high approval ratings due to successful implementation of the act.
Clinton said he expects to see a deal on corporate tax rates and hopes that the reforms will lead to a repatriation of overseas funds that can be used for infrastructure development following a European model of public-private investment. He also stressed the need for immigration reform to ensure that the workforce remains young and diverse in the United States.
“Having lost it, I can tell you, youth matters,” he said.
The conversation ended on a lighter note with Ellis asking how Clinton felt about being a grandfather. Clinton said he remains active in his granddaughter’s life since she lives very close to him in New York.
“The most thrilling thing is being reacquainted with what it’s like for an infant to wake up to the world,” he said. “You can almost see the neural networks forming.”
Students were grateful for the opportunity to see the human side of Clinton.
“It’s weird when you look up to someone and you see them as a portrait, you don’t know what they’re actually like,” said Alexander Coco, a junior majoring in astronautical engineering. “It’s great to be able to put a personality to such a famous figure, and see that sense of humor and how he reacts to questions and people.”
Others said that they enjoyed his theme of cooperation.
“I liked what he said about looking at the opposite point of view and expanding your worldview that way,” said Dylan Eirinberg, a junior majoring in computer science.
 
Editor’s note: this article was updated on Sunday 11/09 to correct the spelling of student Dylan Eirinberg’s name. 
the former president said this:
“We are in the best shape of any big country in the world in the next 20 years. No big country that is running this well is as young as we are, as diverse as we are or as technological as we are. In the next 20 years, there will be bad days, there will be bad headlines, but you can keep the trend lines positive.”
