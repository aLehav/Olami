Sophomore quarterback JT Daniels will miss the rest of the 2019 season with a torn meniscus and an injured ACL, head coach Clay Helton announced Sunday.
Daniels suffered the injury with 27 seconds to go in the first half against Fresno State Saturday after taking a sack and losing a fumble. Helton said after the game that Daniels’ X-ray had come back negative, but an MRI later that night revealed the season-ending injury.
Helton said that Daniels will be receiving surgery in the upcoming weeks and that he is expected to recover within 9 to 12 months.
Daniels started all but one game for the Trojans last season and threw for 2,672 yards and 14 touchdowns in 11 games. 
“I want to thank [Daniels] for the amount of work that he put in, not only to himself but to our football team,” Helton said. “The offseason that he had was just tremendous and it was really nice to be able to see what he was doing in the first half.”
Daniels performed admirably before exiting Saturday’s game, including a nearly perfect opening drive where he completed 10 of 11 passes for 74 yards and a touchdown. It looked like new offensive coordinator Graham Harrell’s Air Raid offense favored the young quarterback, with its quick tempo and focus on simple passing plays.
“We have a saying that [wide receivers] coach Keary Colbert says: ‘So what, now what?’,” redshirt senior defensive lineman Christian Rector said after the game. “We’re looking at the next play, looking at the next guy to step up, and whatever happens, happens.”
True freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis, a three-star recruit out of Scottsdale, Ariz., started the second half in Daniels’ place. Slovis unexpectedly beat out redshirt junior Matt Fink and redshirt sophomore Jack Sears for the backup role this fall. Harrell cited Slovis’ consistency and ability to make challenging passes among the reasons for the decision.
Although Slovis did not expect to be called on, redshirt junior wide receiver Tyler Vaughns said that his teammate seemed ready to come into the game.
“We kept him steady, but he was already ready to come in,” Vaughns said. “He came in, jumped up, shook everybody’s hand and said, ‘Let’s go, let’s get it.’”
Slovis’ apparent nerves resulted in several costly mistakes from the Trojans — an interception, a botched fourth-down and nearly a fumble on the game’s final snap. However, he also showed flashes of excellence, including a 41-yard completion to Vaughns which put the Trojans in position for a touchdown.
Now that Daniels will miss the rest of the season, Slovis must prepare to face rival Stanford next Saturday. Stanford entered the season ranked No. 25 and is coming off a 17-7 win over Northwestern. It remains to be seen whether Slovis can stack up against better competition.
“Any time you’re thrown into that situation and you find a way to win a close ball game, you’ve done your job as a backup quarterback,” Helton said. “Now his role changes to a starter and the preparation that comes with it … We look forward to helping him and helping our football team get ready for a good Stanford team.”

The Coliseum fell silent as sophomore quarterback JT Daniels received medical attention with 27 seconds to go in the first half after taking a sack and losing a fumble.
“Gut-wrenching,” head coach Clay Helton said of Daniels’ injury. “You see a kid who’s poured so much into the game and into this team and into his becoming better both physically and mentally as a quarterback. I said a prayer as soon as I saw it and I hope we’ll get the best results tomorrow and see where it lies.”
Helton said that the nature of Daniels’ injury is still unclear as his X-ray came up negative, but that he would receive an MRI after the game. Helton will reveal the results during his weekly conference call Sunday evening. It was one of many moments during USC’s 31-23 victory over Fresno State that made it feel as though the Trojans hadn’t won the game at all.
Daniels performed well before he departed, completing 10-of-11 passes for 74 yards and a touchdown pass to running back Stephen Carr on the team’s first drive. New offensive coordinator Graham Harrell’s Air Raid offense was on full display from the start as the Trojans built a 14-0 lead early in the first quarter.
The coaching staff called upon true freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis to step in for Daniels. Slovis unexpectedly earned the backup spot as a three-star recruit out of Scottsdale, Ariz.
Slovis’s first play was a handoff for a 6-yard gain. After a short gain on another handoff, Slovis threw to senior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. for a one yard loss, then a slant which was fumbled by redshirt junior Tyler Vaughns. 
Slovis also threw an interception, got tackled trying to hand off the ball on fourth down and nearly fumbled the last snap of the game.
Despite the mistakes, Helton said he was proud of the young quarterback for stepping in to lead the team in Daniels’ absence.
“I always judge their eyes, and there was no fear [from Slovis],” Helton said. “He had one interception on a deep ball, but he had another deep ball that put us in scoring position. He did things in a tough position to win.”
After Fresno State scored a field goal off of Vaughns’ fumble, the score was 17-13 USC, and it seemed that the Bulldogs had all the momentum. As USC fans were holding their breath, recognizing the importance of the next drive, junior wide receiver Velus Jones Jr. returned the kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown. Jones also had a long return on the game’s opening kickoff, but the 61-yard play was called back after the Trojans received a penalty for having two players on the field wearing the No. 7.
Jones’ score gave the fans in the stadium a much-needed boost after Daniels’ injury.
“As a player you have to give hope,” Jones said. “I felt like I gave my team hope and energy to make sure we were successful at the end of the day.”
The Trojan defense held up on the next drive, and two big plays — a 27-yard run by Carr and a 41-yard pass to Vaughns  — brought the Trojans into the red zone once again for a touchdown, giving USC a 31-13 cushion.
After the Trojans’ back-to-back scores, the momentum once again shifted in favor of Fresno State, as the Bulldogs punched in a field goal and a touchdown on consecutive drives to bring themselves within one possession of the Trojans. 
Fresno State drove nearly all the way downfield on the Trojan defense, and it looked like the outcome could be a repeat of so many devastating games for the Trojans last season. With fewer than two minutes to go, redshirt sophomore Isaiah Pola-Mao came up with an interception in the end zone just as the Bulldogs had a chance to tie the game.
Even though the Trojans’ performance was riddled with mistakes, redshirt senior defensive lineman Christian Rector said he was satisfied because the team won.
With so much uncertainty heading into a matchup with rival Stanford at the Coliseum next Saturday, though, the Trojans will need to pick up their level of play against better competition.
“There’s lots to clean up for us,” Helton said. “I thought we left some opportunities out there and thank goodness for a stout defense at the end … So we’ve got a lot to do, a lot to fix before the next game, but we’re 1-0, and we’ll get it corrected and get going.”
