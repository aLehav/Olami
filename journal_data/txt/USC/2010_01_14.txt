As the spring semester begins, the preseason Campbell/Intercollegiate Tennis Association No. 1 USC men’s tennis team gears up for the season and prepares to defend its 2009 NCAA national title.
Favorites · Top-ranked USC includes the No. 1 ranked player in sophomore Steve Johnson as they look to repeat as national champions in 2010. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
After a very successful fall campaign, which features individual as opposed to team play, the Trojans will have one more opportunity to show off their individual talents. This weekend, the team will participate in the Sherwood Collegiate Cup tournament in Westlake, Calif.
The tournament features fierce competition, as the three other participating schools — UCLA, Baylor and Stanford — are all ranked in the ITA Top 10.
Facing the best competition the Pac-10 has to offer and a superb Baylor squad, USC is well positioned as sophomore Steve Johnson and senior Robert Farah respectively hold the top two singles seeds, and the doubles team of Farah and freshmen J.T. Sundling hold the tournament’s No. 2 seed.
This tournament is not only an excellent opportunity for the seeded players to prove themselves against formidable competition but also an opportunity for less-experienced players to gain valuable playing time.
Eight players from each university will compete, as opposed to the typical six, allowing more team members to make their case for playing time before the team match season commences.
“It’s important to play an individual tournament in the spring, it’s a good barometer for the lineup,” coach Peter Smith said.
The opportunity for other players to prove themselves against elite competition will go a long way to determining the lineup for their first dual matches scheduled on Jan. 23. USC will face off against Loyola Marymount and UC Santa Barbara at Marks Tennis Stadium.
Smith mentioned that certain spots on the team have yet to be determined.
“Doubles are still somewhat of a mystery, and we want to see where the freshmen lie,” Smith said.
Along with finalizing certain positional battles, Smith said he would like to observe proper conditioning and a strong sense of competitiveness from his players.
Maintaining this focus is crucial as the preseason No. 1 ranking is an unfamiliar experience for the relatively young team.
“[The ranking presents] new territory, but we’re not going to get caught up in the rankings,” Smith said.
The top ranking results from the bevy of ranked singles players including No. 1 Johnson, No. 14 Farah and No. 47 sophomore Matt Kecki.
This talented bunch sets the team up nicely to strive for USC’s 18th men’s tennis national championship.
The team must guard against complacency as the season begins to wear on. Smith has high hopes for his squad if they stay on track.
“[USC] is the team to beat, if motivated,” Smith said.
The Trojans are in store for a significant challenge as they open up against some of the best competition in the nation at the Sherwood Collegiate Cup.

By now, unless dead or drunk in a ditch somewhere, everyone knows Lane Kiffin has bolted for Southern California.
What they might not know is just how quickly Kiffin has become public enemy number one in Knoxville, Tenn.
As news leaked out on the ESPN wire around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday, the University of Tennessee campus quickly escalated into riot mode, and campus police, many of whom are Volunteer fans, had no intention of stopping it.
About 1,000 students gathered outside the football complex burning the Kiffin promotional “It’s Time” T-shirts in the street, set a mattress ablaze and blocked the exit of the Neyland-Thompson Sports Center — requiring Kiffin to be escorted out by the police, leaving his luxury car parked in the staff lot outside the building.
During that time, a group of Tennessee players began to lash out against their former coach, proclaiming “It’s great to be a Tennessee Vol,” “We are Tennessee” and “We don’t need Lane Kiffin.” They were understandably angry, in shock and looking for answers. Most of all they were defiant.
Tennessee is a proud program, one steeped in tradition, and they scoffed at the notion that Kiffin was the key to the program’s revival.
Tennessee defensive end Ben Martin started cheers of “Bring back Phil, (expletive)” in reference to former coach Phillip Fulmer.
The biggest shock, though, was from USC’s end.
Many wondered aloud why a program which just experienced one of the greatest nine-year run in college football history would hire a man with a combined 12-21 record over the last three years at Oakland and Tennessee, respectively. They understood the interest on Kiffin’s end.
After all, he’s a West Coast guy with a West Coast wife, but why, they wondered, would USC go that direction when so many proven candidates were out there.
In the end, the answer is likely the same as when Tennessee hired him: bloodlines.
By hiring Kiffin as the young brash figurehead, they get defensive guru Monte Kiffin and recruiting ace Ed Orgeron as well. That’s the type of package deal that will get an under-qualified coach a job.
But in the end, Vol fans simply hope they have the last laugh. They see Kiffin as little more than a snake in the grass, a liar and a program wrecking ball.
With the possibility of NCAA sanctions coming down the pipe in Los Angeles, they would like to see nothing more than for Kiffin to get his comeuppance.
At the very least, they’re taking solace in the mark they’ve left on the Kiffin family. As Kiffin slithers his way toward the glitz and glamour of Hollywood, he’s doing so with his year-old son — Knox.
Bradley Merritt is the sports editor of the Daily Beacon, the University of Tennessee’s  daily newspaper. 
I believe Kiffin’s son is going by his first name – Monte – now. =)
Also, if Kiffin is not needed at Tennessee and a “program wrecking ball,” then why are you all so mad he left?

The most shocking part of USC’s decision to hire Lane Kiffin as its next football coach is the level of shock exhibited by everyone else.
It seemed as if the whole college football world — fans, media members and other coaches — recoiled in horror as the news broke. But there was at least one individual who sat in his chair and nodded with approval.
That would be me.
The Kiffin hire — and everything that comes with it — is exactly what USC needs to continue the legacy that Pete Carroll built.
Yes, he essentially treated Tennessee like a one-night stand, departing in the morning with nothing more than a heartless goodbye kiss.
His farewell press conference was indeed a bizarre scene. Kiffin spoke as if a judge had just asked him if he understood the charges, not like a coach who was about to accept his dream job.
But that’s the nature of the business these days. Don’t blame the man, blame the machine.
And sure, he committed a few secondary recruiting violations. But what’s a few recruiting violations among friends? None of them were egregious mistakes.
Hiring Kiffin provides the Trojans with a perfect mix. He is enough of a link to the Carroll era to instill continued confidence in the program from the start, but he’s still his own coach with the drive to succeed.
He knows the landscape well, having been a part of Carroll’s stay at USC. He has run up and down Howard Jones Field, walked out in front of a packed Coliseum crowd and spent some time in Heritage Hall.
Kiffin brings with him the mentality necessary to succeed at an elite program.
He is young and charismatic, making him the perfect choice to connect with current players and recruit new ones.
What recruit wouldn’t want a passionate head coach? What mother and father wouldn’t want their son to play for a family man who emphasized the importance on Wednesday of bringing his wife and children home?
Kiffin has the swagger to coach the Trojans. He is very confident but straddles the line between confidence and cockiness.
Sometimes, he crosses it.
People might be offended by his antics. They might not have liked his comments about University of Florida coach Urban Meyer and the Gators or the assertions he made while coaching Tennessee.
But that confidence is required to coach at a top school. Let me remind you that Carroll carried himself with extreme confidence, and it rubbed off on his team too. Sometimes, he too conveyed cockiness.
It worked for him and the Trojans. Why can’t it work for Kiffin?
He also brings with him a couple of coaches who will do wonders for USC.
His father, Monte Kiffin, is the proud papa of the highly successful “Tampa 2” defense. He is one of the foremost defensive minds in the game of football today and an invaluable asset to the Trojans.
He also brings Ed Orgeron, the man who helped Carroll build his dynasty at USC, back to Los Angeles. Orgeron is an excellent recruiter with previous head coaching experience — and he is intimately familiar with the workings of the USC football program.
Yes, there are questions surrounding Kiffin’s on-field experience as a head coach. He has won only 12 games in his head coaching career, not exactly an earth-shattering total.
But look a little bit deeper inside the numbers.
In Oakland, he did more with less talent than people realize. He coached a team with a washed-up Daunte Culpepper, Josh McCown and JaMarcus Russell. They’re not Rich Gannon and Darrell Lamonica.
The fact that he won five games for Al Davis and didn’t punch anyone in the process is a miracle in and of itself.
At Tennessee, he took over a 5-7 team that lost by an average of two touchdowns in its seven defeats.
Last year, the Volunteers went 7-5 during the regular season and made an appearance in the Chick-fil-A Bowl, albeit a loss to No. 11 Virginia Tech.
But in one year, Kiffin succeeded in putting the Vols back on the right track.
Here, he doesn’t have to do that. Last season was a down year for the Trojans, but they can’t be counted out in 2010.
When Carroll had the program rolling, he never rebuilt ­— he merely reloaded.
By hiring Kiffin, the Trojans simply put more bullets in the chamber to fire off another title.
“Thrilla on Manilla Paper” runs every other Friday. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or e-mail Grant at tunkel@usc.edu.
Actually you make two of us who thought this was a GREAT hire for my Trojans; I am elated. I currently live in Georgia (SEC) country and these local SEC driven media has hounded Coach Kiffin since he first arrived at UTK. Now they are trying to destroy his reputation and name since he fled this neck of the woods. If UTK fans and others think so little of Coach Kiffin, then whay are tehy spending so much time discussing him?
Tennessee fans here have been too funny, acting like a 10th grade girl who got stood up for the prom.
I want whatever you’re smoking. Kiffin was a brutal pick and the best thing that could have happened to UT was his leaving. He is a train wreck waiting to happen. He will surely set the SC recruiting program back with his unethical tactics.The NCAA will limit scholarships as Reggie Bush’s refusal to speak, speaks volumes. I would project a decade of mediocrity for the “mighty” Trojans.
UT fans = WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Which flavor of Kool Aid are you drinking?  Parents want a man of integrity, not this dufus.  Keep in mind, All that has happened is Kiffin has used a Trojan to screw everyone in Tennessee.
I think there are a few things that will improve right away with the Trojans. One is defense as I think Monte Kiffin is a better defensive coordinator than was Carroll. Also I believe that our offense will improve from this last season as is was really flat under Jeremy Bates. Bates just didn’t seem to fit well with the college game and took a very conservative NFL type approach when running the offense. Even though we aren’t getting Norm Chow I think Lane Kiffin is a capable offensive coordinator as he saw some success with USC in ’05 and ’06 and he increased Tennessees offensive output by a bunch in ’09 compared to ’08. I also think we will improve a great deal with recruiting with Ed Orgeron coming back. Let’s face it, he was the driving force that built up the USC program under Carroll in the first place and it really only took him one year to do so. In one year at Tennessee he and Lane were able to bring in the #6 ranked recruiting class for 2010.
Now the things I worry a great deal about are NCAA sanctions and recruiting violations. If Kiffin and Orgeron are able to keep their hands clean I will be suprized but if they do accomplish that this hire will prove to be a good one.
This is a slow trainwreck coming for USC.  Kiffin will be as much an embarassment to the Trojans as he was to Tennessee.  More importantly, he will attract further NCAA attention to the already under-investigation USC football program.  Monte may not be able to backstop his impulsive son this time.

When the Trojans travel across town to face UCLA on Saturday, they might notice something missing from Pauley Pavilion, the home of college basketball’s most storied program. That would be the Bruins’ luster, lost amid a sputtering start by a team that reached the NCAA Final Four as recently as 2008.
Ball control · Senior guard Mike Gerrity and the Trojans have suffered from late-game miscues recently. Gerrity also sees the need for aggressiveness on the floor, which will lead to free throw opportunities.- Avi Kushlan | Daily Trojan 
“It’s probably not their strongest year in the past five,” said redshirt senior guard Mike Gerrity.
While the Trojans (10-6, 2-2) have exceeded expectations this season with victories against the likes of UNLV and Tennessee, the Bruins are struggling to keep up. No longer the dominant team in Los Angeles, UCLA (7-9, 2-2) is off to its worst start in seven years.
But the Trojans aren’t taking their opponent lightly.
“In the Pac-10, every game every team comes out to play, no matter if you’re in first place or 10th place,” Gerrity said. “We’re still expecting a tough ball game.”
That kind of mindset should come in handy, especially because UCLA has begun to show signs of life. After losing four of their first six games, the Bruins have reversed course by going 4-2 since their loss to Notre Dame on     Dec. 19.
UCLA’s recent revival includes a 76-75 overtime victory against California, the same team that handed the Trojans a 67-59 loss last Saturday.
Still searching for its first road win of the season, USC must address late-game miscues from that contest in order to get past the Bruins.
Turnovers, offensive fouls and missed shots doomed the Trojans in the final minutes against Cal. USC also had trouble scoring near the rim and went to the free throw line just five times.
“I know personally the past two games I haven’t been to the free throw line once,” Gerrity said. “We definitely want to be more aggressive, get to the basket and force defenses to play us.”
Along with taking a more active approach on offense, the Trojans will look to contain UCLA guards sophomore Malcolm Lee and senior Michael Roll, who both average close to 14 points per game. USC currently ranks second in the nation in points allowed per game at 55.2, behind Arizona State.
Gerrity, who played for Pepperdine and Charlotte before transferring to USC last year, will be facing the Bruins for the first time.
“I’m excited,” he said. “I’ve grown up in Southern California, and I’ve seen the [USC-UCLA] rivalry my entire life. To be part of it — be on the court and hopefully contribute to a win — would just be exciting.”

Nothing seems to bring a national television audience together like a USC bowl game.
For the first time in eight years the Trojans were not invited to a BCS bowl game, but instead played in the Emerald Bowl on Dec. 26.
The Trojans off year was a blessing in disguise for the ESPN network, whose broadcast of the Emerald Bowl was their second highest rated broadcast of the bowl season and the network’s third highest all-time.
The game’s 5.6 rating share equates to about 7.6 million viewers for the game played the day after Christmas and during primetime on the East Coast.
The Jan. 2 matchup of Michigan State and Texas Tech in the Alamo Bowl was the only non-BCS bowl game to attract a larger audience than the Emerald Bowl.
The matchup between USC and Boston College brought together a national television audience of families already camped in front of their TVs on the traditionally lazy day after Christmas.
The Trojans prevailed in the Emerald Bowl 24-13 in front of an equally attentive sell-out crowd in San Francisco despite the rainy conditions the day of the game.
USC has had a tradition of attracting large television audiences, especially in their past few BCS bowls.
In each of the teams past three trips to the Rose Bowl, the Trojans have attracted the largest television audience for any bowl except the national title game, and their 2006 BCS National Championship Game against Texas is the highest rated bowl game of all time.

After conceding the vice presidential ticket, resigning as governor of Alaska and reflecting on her life in Going Rogue, Sarah Palin is back. Just when we thought the firestorm of Palin-centric jokes had been doused with the passing of time, Palin has reclaimed the media’s attention, this time under some very interesting circumstances. 
Earlier this week, Fox News officially announced Palin as a regular contributor under a multi-year contract. In a public statement, Palin remarked, “It’s wonderful to be part of a place that so values fair and balanced news.” But according to a Pew Research poll, Fox News appears to be one of the most ideological news channels, with about 50 percent of the viewership subscribing to the “mostly conservative” camp.
The move surprised many who don’t believe Palin fits the mold of a typical news analyst — she allegedly asked McCain aides what the difference was between North and South Korea. In fact, critics on both sides of the political and ideological spectrum have had their fair share of comments about her new job — with some confident in her abilities to provide refreshing analysis and others discrediting both Fox News and Palin as a match made in stooge heaven.
Yet, in this spotlight, something is indeed different. In adopting this new role, Palin has switched sides to help create the media frenzy that mercilessly devoured her. Now, while she may still be fodder for late-night comedy, she also has a voice of her own, a loaded weapon that is in the position to change the course of how the media presents politics, the economy and Sarah Palin herself.
Though her agenda for 2012 remains opaque, it’s apparent that she is not retreating from the public arena. Rather, recall the circus-esque fashion in which she rose to notoriety, or fame, depending on how you vote.
Magnifying her populist voice as the mouthpiece of a legitimate news source seems to be the logical step for her to maintain the public’s attention and try to gain more respect as a politician. This former Alaskan governor has her ducks, and wolves, in a row.
That is, her influence is something to be reckoned with. Palin’s appearance on Oprah last November yielded the highest viewer ratings since the Osmonds’ appearance in 2007. After the election, Rasmussen Reports indicated that 69 percent of Republican voters believed Palin helped the McCain ticket. Both events occurred while she was still the laughing stock for a big part of American media.

Now that she’s a member of the media, what does this mean?
She can now hurl her critiques at President Obama from a higher platform, and Fox News and CNN can prolong their bipartisan battle with Palin at the reins.
During her debut interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly, she said that liberals are not threatened by her, but rather by the “common sense conservative solutions” she represents.
To a certain extent, she is correct. Washington and the public aren’t used to having a politician who is so openly, shall we say, down-to-earth and who walks such a fine line between respected public figure and joke.
All things considered, it’s still surprising and a bit disconcerting that Fox News hired her.
What insight can she provide that other conservative politicians can’t? To be frank, not much.
If anything, Fox merely perpetuates the controversy of its right-leaning bias, while Palin gets a more opportune platform to vehemently broadcast her ideals in Main street prose.
Regardless of the rationale behind the new hire, one thing is certain. Palin’s influence is apparent and growing. Just as she had gone rogue from the McCain campaign, she has made an unexpected arrival to the news channel.
While it’s unclear as to exactly how many supporter or detractors she will gain from this experience, what is certain is that Palin’s gig at Fox News will ultimately increase her thrust as a public figure.

There is no better way to get informed on a broad variety of topics than to have a paid staff to do the research for you. This is what everyone in Congress has. The last I heard each Representative has a staff budget of $6,000,000. I’m certain that in Alaska her staff was focused on Alaska not world wide or even USA wide issues.
A “curious” move? Are you serious? She is a smash hit and no one can  deny it based on the ratings. This is a huge win for FOX, and Sarah Palin.  She is  like teflon, the more liberals try to smear her, the stronger and more resilient she becomes.  As liberals mock  her, she just becomes more interesting and relevant, and I have to hear what she has to say.  It seems all the attacks have back fired, and actually shown what a fighter Sarah Palin in.
Exactly right! She’s a star, and people all over the country are interested in her. Every time a TV show (like Oprah) hosts Sarah Palin, they get record-breaking ratings. FOX benefits, Sarah Palin benefits, and the viewers benefit — both those who love her and those who love to hate her.
The “fair and balanced” moniker is earned partly because their opinion shows ALWAYS invite both conservative and liberal guests to debate the issues. Bill O’Reilly’s show does this especially well. Even though he is often attacked as a “right wing” host, he actually takes a moderate pose and lets guests like Dick Morris or Mary Katherine Ham argue the conservative position against liberals like Juan Williams. Liberals would have no problem finding people to root for on any of FOX News’s opinion programs.
The problem for liberals is that they don’t do well in debates. They do best in programs where all the voices are liberal, and each issue is discussed for less than 60 seconds, with lots of pictures and video. Once you actually start talking and thinking about issues, conservative positions win out. That’s why talk radio and the most “adult” newspapers lean conservative, while cable news and comedy shows lean liberal.
Joe, thanks for that fantastic insight. I’m so happy you’ve shared the truth with me that those darn childish liberals do poorly in debates and only discuss issues for 60 seconds, while the big grown-up logical conservatives win because THEY, and only they, have the ability to talk and think. Enlightening.
Sounds like someone is a future fair and balanced Fox News anchor…
Please note that Brendan didn’t offer any evidence to refute Joe; he merely mocked him.
Really? I need evidence to counter his assertion that “adult” programming is equivalent to “conservative” programming? C’monnn.
Nadine, you make a crucial error in confusing Fox News Channel’s MORE fair and balanced news (which they do in fact provide, based on many other polls and surveys)… to its viewership. The political view of their viewership does not equal the political view they espouse or offer. Surveying their viewers is an asinine way of attempting to analyze their viewpoint. 
That being said, Fox News provides NEWS that is more fair and balanced than the other networks, and they offer OPINION that tends to be more conservative. So what? The other networks are almost overwhelmingly liberal in the opinion they offer, PLUS they taint their news with a lack of objectivity. 
Fox News showed a former vice presidential candidate the respect that her views might be of interest to the public. That’s hardly an outrageous move. Oprah did the same when she booked her.
You shouldn’t use rumors (Korea’s) from people (Schmidt) with an agenda to base your argument. You can state the rumor, but should clarify to the audience that it is a rumor. Said by someone with a track record of lies. . Least ye be cast with the same “biased” insult..

It’s becoming a pretty common routine for college students.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
After hours of sitting in a tiny seat taking notes while listening to professors lecture, reading several chapters of textbooks and writing what seems to be an endless amount of papers, most students end up going home to sit on their sofas to watch on T.V.
A metal box with the ability to transport viewers to any city, area, realm or universe (real or not) from the comfort of their living room, T.V. has the power to momentarily alleviate one’s worries and take a peek into an unfamiliar world or situation.
But that comes at a price. Sure, we’ve all heard our parents talk about the terrible evils of too much T.V. — our eyes going bad and falling out, our minds going blank and our bodies becoming couch potatoes­­— but frankly, few college students have the time to spend a whole day in front of the T.V. (although there are some who wish they could).
Instead, I’m talking about the price of T.V. — literally, in dollars and cents.
A recent article published in the New York Times on Jan. 3 said Time Warner Cable increased its fees in reaction to pressure it faced from Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, which demanded more money from the cable company. The fees generally go unnoticed by consumers, and thus the companies are able to increase their profits with minimal protest.
“Content providers are testing the limits — hoping to raise the bar as high as possible,” said Steve Ridge,  president of the media strategy group for the consulting firm Frank N. Magid Associates in an interview with the New York Times.
The Times also said broadcasters are upset that cable companies get paid by both advertisers and consumer fees, thereby having two sources of revenue. Time Warner Cable is not the only company to start increasing its fees — DirecTV and Comcast are expected to also increase their fees due to demands from broadcasters.
But while cable companies and broadcasters battle it out, many consumers including college students are left wondering whether these high-flying companies are aware of an invention that allows people to see the same shows without the high prices — the internet.
With cable bills going up and having the convenience of watching shows on one’s own laptop, college students are quickly leaving their televisions in the corner and visiting various websites such as Hulu, My Easy TV and Channelsurfing.net. These new websites, among many others, allow viewers to watch live T.V. and catch all the top shows, sporting events and movies for free.
Noting this, why aren’t cable companies doing something to attract consumers rather than turning them away by raising prices?
The answer to this question: The blame game. Broadcasters are blaming cable providers and vice versa. Both acknowledge the threat of online T.V. but neither is willing to back down for the fear of suffering a profit loss.
However, by relying on habit as a means from which cable companies can survive is naïve at best. Though technology-illiterate older viewers may opt to swallow the higher fees, younger viewers (especially college students) on a tighter budget might decide to dump the T.V. set and turn on their laptops.
The truth is college students neither have the time to analyze cable bills and figure out the percent increase of the charges cable companies are demanding nor do students have the free time to be making calls to cable companies demanding explanations for the fee increases (as if any justification would make the consumer feel happy about paying more). College students do not have the patience to deal with rising prices and are better off simply switching to online T.V. if they feel prices are going up.
As for me, I’m going to stick to cable for now. But if I notice they’re trying to squeeze fee increases in my bill I’ll be relieved to know that my laptop (with its high-speed internet connection) is only a couple feet away.

At the recommendation of the university, the Interfraternity Council has advised chapters to cancel Welcome Back Nights events scheduled for Thursday night.
In a memo to the IFC executive board, the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development recommended that fraternities rethink their plans to hold social events on Thursday.
“It has come to the attention of The Office of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development that events during the period called ‘Welcome Back Nights’ have created an alarming concern for safety in the greek and university community,” the letter stated. “At the highest request of The Department of Public Safety and with consultation with Senior Administration, it is the expectation that any and all events occurring tonight on Thursday, January 14, 2010 be cancelled.”
Though the letter did not order that events be cancelled, Eric Ronan, president of IFC, said he strongly recommended that the houses follow the university’s advice.
“I advised them, because of the advice of DPS and the advice of the university, that they should follow the advice of the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life,” Ronan said. “But it’s at their discretion.
Ronan said the recommendation from the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development was prompted mainly because of the large number of non-USC students who attempted to attend the Welcome Back Nights events.
“Our fraternity policy is that only USC students are allowed to come to the events and unfortunately there were a lot of non-USC students trying to get in, and when they weren’t allowed that was what caused a lot of the congestion,” Ronan said.
Thursday’s Department of Public Safety incident log noted that DPS officers responded to several instances of large groups of people gathered outside of fraternity houses.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said there were more than 2,000 people on The Row last night. Carlisle also noted that parties on weeknights are against university policy.
“Over the past couple of years there have been gentlemen’s agreements that if they’re inside the house and there’s nobody out drinking, and we can’t hear the music outside, we might have an agreement that that’s not a party.  But occasionally people become more lax and they turn into parties, like last night when there were more than 2,000 people.”
Ronan said he is not sure how non-USC students caught wind of the Welcome Back Nights events.
Carlisle said six parties were shutdown by DPS Wednesday night. He noted, however, that all the fraternities were cooperative.
Ronan added that there were no alcohol-related issues Wednesday night.
“The only real issue was the volume of people,” he said.
This is ridiculous.  The only reason for the overcrowding was that people from other schools still on winter break got USC ID’d and stood in the street.

Former congressman Tom Campbell announced this morning that he will take himself out of the running to replace Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and will instead enter the race to unseat U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer.
In a video posted on his website today, Campbell announced his decision to his supporters.
“Now, when our national debt has skyrocketed to more than $12 trillion— that’s more than $40,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States — I strongly considered where I could serve, and where I could do the most good,” Campbell said. “Today, I’m announcing my candidacy for the United States Senate.”
Campbell also sent an e-mail to his supporters and made a formal announcement this morning at a Los Angeles hotel, ABC7 reported.
According to the Los Angeles Times, Campbell cited the economic strength of his opponents in the gubernatorial race as one of his reasons for making the switch.
“The path of public service and teaching is rewarding, but it does not afford one the ability to invest millions of dollars in a campaign for office,” Campbell wrote in the e-mail to supporters.
In the gubernatorial race, Campbell was facing stiff competition from the other Republican candidates — former eBay CEO Meg Whitman and state Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner.
Now, Campbell will take on former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and state assemblyman Chuck DeVore in the Senate GOP primary. The winner of the primary will face Boxer.
The San Jose Mercury News reported today that Campbell, considered a moderate Republican, could benefit from being generally well-liked and recognized.
Campbell has run for Senate twice before, losing in the primary in 1992, and then winning the primary but losing to Sen. Dianne Feinstein in 2000.

For those of you who’ve been hoarding your parents’ 33 1/3 records since high school, fervidly believing that they will one day regain their worth and merit, you can now rejoice: vinyl has officially made a comeback. According to Nielsen SoundScan, an information system that tracks music and music video product sales throughout the U.S. and Canada, vinyl records had their highest tally since SoundScan began tracking music sales in the late 1980s — 2.5 million new albums sold. This number represents a — how appropriate — 33 percent increase in vinyl sales since 2008.
Although the Los Angeles Times “Pop & Hiss” music blog maintains that “overall vinyl sales are minuscule in the grand scheme of the industry,” this unexpected rise undoubtedly means analog is starting to earn some R-E-S-P-E-C-T from the digital generation. Now, if only Nielsen could track the ratio between vinyl buyers and fedora owners…
Below is a list of the top 10 best-selling vinyl albums of 2009:
​1.​ The Beatles, Abbey Road (34,800)
​2.​ Michael Jackson, Thriller (29,800)
​3.​ Animal Collective, Merriweather Post Pavilion (14,000)
​4.​ Wilco, Wilco (13,200)
​5.​ Fleet Foxes, Fleet Foxes (12,700)
​6.​ Pearl Jam, Backspacer (12,500)
​7.​ Grizzly Bear, Veckatimest (11,600)
​8. ​Guns N’ Roses, Appetite for Destruction (11,500)
​9.​ Dave Matthews Band, Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King (11,500)
​10. ​Radiohead, In Rainbows (11,400)

The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday to ban widespread broadcasting of the landmark Proposition 8 trial, blocking the planned broadcasts of the trial on YouTube.com.
The Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday that the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to disallow the broadcasts of the trial challenging California’s Proposition 8, which bans gay marriage in the state.
The justices cited improper procedures in approving broadcasting of the trial, overturning a previous ruling by Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker in a 5-4 vote.
“It appears the courts below did not follow the appropriate procedures set forth in federal law before changing their rules to allow such broadcasting,” said the court in its 17-page ruling, posted on USAtoday.com.
Although a California federal trial has never been broadcast before, Walker’s decision allowed real-time streaming of the Proposition 8 trial at courthouses in San Francisco, Pasadena, Seattle, Portland, Ore. and Brooklyn, N.Y. Walker also approved to post taped videos of the trial on YouTube on a later date.
Now, the trial can only be viewed on TV in a courtroom at the Golden Gate Avenue courthouse, where the trial is taking place, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.
Vincent Vigil, the director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Resource Center at USC, said he believed there would have been certain benefits to broadcasting the trial.
“We need to be aware of the tactics that were used by the people who supported Prop 8,” Vigil said. “…We live in a media age, and we would prefer to see the trial.”
Vigil also said, however, that he believes the Supreme Court was attempting to avoid the “media circus” that accompanies high-profile cases.

Fans hoping to see offensive guru Norm Chow return to USC and help Lane Kiffin restore the football program after the sudden departure of Pete Carroll might be out of luck. According to an anonymous source in the UCLA athletics department, Chow requested a contract extension after being contacted by USC and assured UCLA coach Rick Neuheisel that he wants to stay.
Chow, a former offensive coordinator at USC from 2001-04 who coached alongside Kiffin under Pete Carroll and helped the Trojans win two national titles, left USC in the spring of 2005. He became the offensive coordinator for the NFL’s Tennessee Titans until joining the football staff at USC’s cross town rival UCLA in 2008.
According to the Los Angeles Times, it was USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett’s decision to try to bring back Chow to reunite a coaching staff that includes defensive line coach and top recruiter Ed Orgeron.
“I said, ‘You know, it would be nice if we brought that whole staff back,’ ” Garrett said, “and I don’t think Lane was against that. So that’s what we’re trying to do.”
Although a deal to extend Chow’s contract hasn’t been made yet, Neuheisel feels good about his chances of keeping his offensive coordinator at UCLA.
“There are all sorts of negotiations,” Neuheisel said. “What’s important is that Norm is saying he wants to be at UCLA.”
Ultimately, the decision may come down to which school can pay Chow the most money and USC may have the upper hand in that situation. Chow is expected to make $640,000 at UCLA next season, including a $250,000 bonus.
Hi Trojan Fans,MY stomach muscles are way better the chubby oberonnn! Carroll is pac ten champ this season!?Why ,how?

If Chow chooses to stay at UCLA then he deserves to lose. It was a mistake leaving SC in the first place for the Titans. Wait, how did that work out again? SC is like the Lakers, UCLA like the Clippers. It’s choosing between winning and losing…

The Office of Financial Aid has been gutted and reconstructed — both in its physical appearance and its structural organization — in an attempt to combat the customer service issues that plagued the financial aid office last summer.
Waiting room · Students wait to meet with financial aid officers in the department’s recently redesigned office. The office was renovated after complains were raised this summer. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
When financial aid packages were released this summer, many students took issue with their aid awards and went to the financial aid office with questions and complaints. But students and parents trying to find answers were met with long lines and inefficient customer service, something Katharine Harrington, dean of admission and financial aid, sought to change.
“We have completely redone our lobby, but it is much more than a physical reconstruction,” Harrington said.
The changes, which began last semester, were aimed at redesigning customer service and the experience at the financial aid office. The office has implemented new technologies and strategies to ensure a more streamlined process for students and parents who have questions about their aid packages.
“We have private meeting rooms, two financial aid counselors in semi-private areas who can sit and meet with students, computerized queue systems and six computerized self-service stations,” Harrington said.
Last semester’s problems, she said, were part of a “snowball effect.” Documents were lost because of technical problems so students didn’t always get their aid packages on time or at all. When they went looking for answers, students encountered even more problems.
“Essentially, our system was overwhelmed, and that was shown in the problems that arose,” Harrington said of the prior system.
To avoid future mishandling of documents, the office is now handling paperwork electronically, and students will be able to scan their documents into the system.
“We are putting much more technology behind document handling so that way when students submit the documents they will get into files more quickly and more efficiently,” Harrington said.
To address the customer service issues, the financial aid office hired an outside consultant to reconstruct the phone system. The goal, Harrington said, is to get callers in contact with live representatives more quickly.
“It’s going to take a few months, but the phone system will be much speedier and will get students and family to a real person to talk to faster. My belief will be that the entire process will be much easier for families to navigate,” Harrington said.
Jonathan Willbanks, a junior majoring in business administration-cinema television, recently visited the new office and said he was pleased with the efficient process, but still had issues with phone service.
“I think the changes are a step in the right direction,” he said. “However, yesterday I tried to call and I got the standard voicemail that there were so many people in front of me and then they disconnected me. I think that the telephone support is lacking. E-mail works well.”
Tim McNally, a junior majoring in international relations, said he is excited by the changes to the financial aid office.
“They fall apart on customer service, and I think this step is awesome,” McNally said. “It sounds like the changes are absolutely critical.”
With these changes and the impending allotment of financial aid awards for the incoming freshman class starting in February, the financial aid office is looking forward to a smooth process devoid of the problems experienced last semester.
In spite of the changes, some students still worry about the size of their aid packages.
“As reassuring as the changes are, I am worried they are not going to address the larger problems of financial availability,” Willbanks said.
It’s an encouraging step in the right direction. I hope they’ll now tackle the problem they have estimating the true cost of attendance. By their consistently underestimating by about $8000 a year, they’re doing a terrible disservice to each and every student and their families, who have to struggle to cover the gap when money runs out midway through each semester. 
USC is not the only university trying to improve its attractiveness by understating its cost of attendance, but an accurate estimate is critical to every family’s ability to budget through the college years and beyond. Even if a bank is willing to lend you the money you know you need, the school can only certify the amount it says you need. If that amount is off, the money runs out too soon, and the financial and emotional impact on the families can be devastating. $8000 a year is a huge gap to fill.
If the school were honest up front, we wouldn’t take up so much of their time trying to find creative ways to request and justify one-time “budget increases.” Just think how much shorter the wait time would be!

Starting right where they left off last year, the women’s tennis team will open their season this weekend  with hopes of not only keeping their No. 9 ranking, but repeating as Pac-10 conference champions.
Start · Junior Christy Andrews and USC open their season today. - Amaresh Sunduran Kuppuswamy  Daily Trojan
Four USC players also earned individual singles rankings. Junior Maria Sanchez leads the way by matching her highest career singles ranking at No. 8 in the nation. Freshmen Danielle Lao and Valeria Pulido are ranked No. 18 and 37, respectively, while sophomore Alison Ramos is ranked at No. 39. In the doubles mix, Ramos is paired with Pulido as the No. 19-ranked doubles team.
Last year, the team finished 21-3 overall after a run to the NCAA second round, placing them ninth in the nation. They also went undefeated in Pac-10 play, claiming the 2009 conference title, snapping a 23-year losing streak to Stanford along the way. This helped secure coach Richard Gallien’s selection as the Pac-10 Coach of the Year. Starting his 15th season this year, this was the third time Gallien was selected for this award.
After winning its first ever Pac-10 Championship, the team hopes to repeat its success.
The Pac-10 is one of the toughest conferences in the nation. Although UCLA continues to be the Women of Troy’s biggest rival every year, the conference is especially deep this season.
“Cal and Stanford are also some of our toughest competitors this year,” Lao said.
Cal, ranked No. 3, is the only other Pac-10 team to be ranked in the top 10, followed by UCLA at No. 12 and Stanford at No. 13.
“Our ultimate goal is to win a national title, but, before that, we’re going for another Pac-10 title,” Sanchez said. “If we just keep working hard and keep up our team unity, I think we can do just that.”
USC will kick off its 2010 season today, split between two tournaments from Jan. 14-17. One tourney will be played in Palm Springs, Calif. and the other in Las Vegas. USC’s first dual match play opens at home on Jan. 21 against Long Beach State at Marks Stadium.

Tuesday’s hiring of Lane Kiffin began to mend a 2010 recruiting class fragmented by the loss of former coach Pete Carroll.
Tough to replace · Former Trojan assistant coach for defense Ken Norton Jr. recruited a slew of talented and highly ranked recruits during his time at USC. Ed Orgeron and Lane Kiffin hope to match his success. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Kyle Prater, the top receiver and No. 3 overall high school player in the country according to Rivals.com, reaffirmed his commitment to enroll in spring classes at USC yesterday morning. The Illinois wide receiver, who had promised to be on campus for the beginning of spring semester, was rethinking his pledge to the university in the wake of Carroll’s departure.
Meanwhile, quarterback prospect Jesse Scroggins of Lakewood High in California confirmed his pledge to USC after learning of Kiffin’s hiring. Scroggins announced that he would consider playing for other schools if USC did not name a new head coach by Saturday.
Reaffirmed commitments by some of the country’s top players will come as a relief to Trojan fans who watched the 2010 recruiting class unravel when Carroll left his post. On Saturday, as the nation’s top high school players gathered to play the U.S. Army All-American Bowl, news of Carroll’s contract with the Seattle Seahawks became official.
After learning of Carroll’s decision last Saturday, Ronald Powell, a defensive end from Moreno Valley High and the nation’s No. 1 overall prospect, announced that he would rather play for the University of Florida than become a Trojan.
Additionally, ESPN scout Steve Mason speculated that Carroll’s departure dropped USC’s chance of landing Seantrel Henderson, USA Today’s 2009 Offensive Player of The Year, from a “sure thing … to a jump ball.” Though Powell may be gone, Kiffin’s arrival has improved the probability of Henderson joining the university.
USC’s recruiting class will also be padded by local recruits, such as Robert Woods, regarded by some scouts as the best wide receiver in the 2010 class, Demetrius Wright, a promising cornerback from Corona High and other standout players. Most scouts speculate that, after the loss of Carroll, USC’s recruiting class would have ranked in the range of No. 10 to No.15 and  would still be the Pac-10’s top recruiting class.
Now, with the hiring of Kiffin and the addition of recruiting extraordinaire Ed Orgeron, those rankings may rise. Still, in the hopes of competing for a national title, the Trojan coaching staff will continue to target top athletes who have gone astray after Carroll’s departure.
A football program is only as good as the strength of its future players. With just three weeks until National Signing Day, both Kiffin and Orgeron know there is work to be done.
Kiffin was entertaining at UT…definitely brought some energy back to a program that needed it…unfortunately hyperactive children do that wherever they go.  For the first time in my life, as i find myself thinking back to what Al Davis said when he fired Kiffin, i find myself agreeing with Al….can’t trust Lane..Good luck with him and I hope it works out for USC.
Hopefully Kiffin can keep this up. Insightful piece.

Despite the many years of success, the numerous NCAA national championships, the vast number of Mountain Pacific Sports Federation titles and the countless weeks of No. 1 rankings, one might be hard-pressed to find a time in the USC men’s water polo team’s decorated history when they showed as much experience as they did in the 2009 season.
Top performer · Senior two-meter Shea Buckner contributed big defensive plays down the stretch and made the All-Tournament team.  - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
So as time ran out in the final round of the NCAA tournament and the Trojans were once again crowned National Champions, it seemed fitting that the key to their success were the very players who had been there the longest: the senior class.
As has been the norm for the Trojans this season, the group of 10 seniors — most of whom had been together since their freshman year — propelled both the offensive and defensive attack, leading USC to a 7-6 win over their cross-town rival and providing the perfect ending to a near-perfect four year stretch at USC.
Setting the Bar
For the seniors, their journey began in the fall of 2006.
Fresh off a national championship run in 2005, the Trojans’ bid to defend their title was snatched from their hands in the final seconds of the NCAA tournament final by California , leaving the team unsatisfied and hungry for another chance.
The 2007 season provided the opportunity for redemption: USC had once again bull-rushed through its regular season schedule, entering the NCAA tournament with an 18-2 record and a No. 1 ranking. But after an opening-round win against LMU, the Trojans once again were stymied by Cal’s attack, losing 8-6 and falling victim to the Golden Bears for the second year in a row.
Despite the heartbreaking losses of the previous two years, 2008 marked a pinnacle year for the men’s water polo team. Led by a large core of experienced juniors and seniors, the Trojans breezed through all the competition they faced in both regular season and tournament play, finishing with a 29-0 record and a resounding 7-5 win over host Stanford. This was the first true taste of victory for the now-senior class, who had come so close in the previous years’ title matches only to be denied.
“We were putting everything on the line,” said senior Shea Buckner after the 2008 championship game. “All of our friends, our old teammates, all of our best friends leading the cheers — it was awesome, a great experience.”
One Last Chance
Despite finally securing a championship, the seniors still had one opportunity left to repeat. With many of the same pieces in place from the season prior, the Trojans were able to once again lead the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation with a 22-1 regular season record, entering postseason play with the No. 1 ranking.
Despite a rare loss to UCLA and a third place finish in the MPSF tournament, the Trojans still entered the NCAA tournament with the first seed and disposed of host Princeton in the opening round 13-3.
Headed into the championship game, the Trojans were faced with several opportunities in addition to the chance to win back-to-back titles. Not only could they win the season series against rival UCLA, but they could win a national championship for the first time in school history against a team other than Stanford.
With the experience and cohesion of the team at an all-time high, the Trojans wasted no opportunities, holding off a strong UCLA attack to secure their fifth national championship.
Senior two-meter Jordan Thompson — who captured the NCAA tournament MVP — and sophomore driver Peter Kurzeka led the Trojans with two goals each; senior two-meters J.W. Krumpholz and Buckner and senior driver Matt Sagehorn each added a score as well.
The Trojans were first to get on the board, as Kurzeka was able to find the net during a counterattack to put USC up in the opening minutes. A Thompson penalty shot notched the second goal for the Trojans, and then Krumpholz — who has scored in four straight NCAA tournament final matches — blasted in a shot from the post to give USC a 3-0 advantage.
After UCLA was able to narrow the score to 4-3 in the second, the vaunted Trojan defense — which has been ranked first in the nation for the last five years — came alive, coming up with several key blocks to create counterattacks for USC. Once again, it was Thompson and Kurzeka driving the Trojans’ scoring, as the senior found pay dirt on a well-contested hook shot and the sophomore was able to skip in a shot from the left side to put USC up by three again.
But UCLA continued to fight, and goals from juniors Jacob Murphy and Ben Hohl in the final minutes of the third brought the Bruins to within one score going into the fourth period.
Like so many previous games this season, it was USC’s finishing ability in the fourth period that allowed the team to prevail. Sagehorn blasted a huge goal to put the Trojans up 7-5 with four minutes left, and despite another Hohl score for the Bruins, the defense was able to stamp out the UCLA attack in the final two minutes to secure the title.
“We were focused on our defense throughout the entire game, and we did a great job stopping UCLA’s extra man,” said coach Jovan Vavic, who has been a part of all five Trojan national titles. “We shut down their best outside shooter and everybody contributed.”
Part of the reason for their success, according to Thompson, can be attributed to the experience of the team and the players’ familiarity with playing in the championship round.
“I’ve never felt that calm before a game, and the guys were saying that they all felt the same way,” Thompson said. “We knew what we were doing and we went in being confident, and that really helped us.”
Vavic was equally pleased with the end of the season.
“It was a wonderful ending to the best generation we’ve ever had,” Vavic said. “It is really fitting for these boys to end up on top, to win their last collegiate game, and to beat UCLA. It’s one of those dream-come-true endings, and I am extremely proud of them and I am really going to miss them.”

I can only hope that, somewhere in America, a student being asked to explain an explosive chemical reaction on a test is writing “Lane Kiffin plus USC” as the answer.
Changes · Freshman quarterback Matt Barkely will need to learn a new offensive system when Kiffin and whoever the new Trojan coach names as offensive coordinator begin to install their system next season. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
Any open-minded teacher would grant at least partial credit.
If USC meant to grab national attention with its newest head coaching hire, consider it a mission accomplished and then some. But the reverberations from the move were still traveling Wednesday when Kiffin was formally introduced as head coach.
The marriage between USC and the brash 34-year-old coach firmly entrenches USC football as one of the most despised brands in college sports. A subtler move would have been replacing the sword-wielding statue of Tommy Trojan with a new version extending the middle finger to everyone not affiliated with USC.
That’s not to say Kiffin will be a surefire flop in his new position. But given the acrimony that his name evokes, USC fans should be prepared to adopt an us-against-the-world mentality for the foreseeable future.
You would be hard-pressed to find a Kiffin supporter outside of Los Angeles right now because of the countless enemies he has made over the years. Columnists and fans almost universally panned USC following yesterday’s announcement.
Whatever goodwill he built up in Tennessee went up in flames Tuesday night, as did a mattress that was burned that evening. Volunteer fans mobbed the university’s football complex in a raucous display so intense that it put the villagers from Frankenstein to shame.
“I thought to myself that they were upset that we’re leaving because of what we were doing,” Kiffin said, in a bizarrely optimistic statement for someone who had merchandise with his image on it burned the previous night. “If they weren’t upset that we were leaving, we weren’t doing anything right.”
Given all the vitriol that follows him, Kiffin would be wise to learn a lesson in playing nice — especially with the folks at the NCAA.
Kiffin’s hire was all the more surprising because of the possible sanctions USC faces, depending on deliberations at an NCAA meeting that Yahoo! Sports reported will take place from Feb. 19-21.
Not only was Kiffin on staff at USC at the time Reggie Bush was alleged to have received extra benefits, but Kiffin also made a name for himself in Tennessee by running afoul of the rules. He committed six secondary violations in his 14 months and was chided by opponents for playing fast and loose in recruiting.
“It was not a large amount of violations; it was not out of whack,” Kiffin said, citing the conference-wide penchant for rule-bending.
Kiffin quickly expanded and said he would strive to not commit any violations, but by then he had already missed a perfect opportunity to take ownership of his past mistakes. The Southeastern Conference is renowned for its Wild West attitude in recruiting, but Kiffin’s pace was still disconcerting.
Bringing Kiffin aboard sends almost the polar opposite message to the NCAA that USC broadcast when the university hired squeaky-clean Kevin O’Neill to run its basketball program.
By hiring O’Neill, USC said, “We repent.”
By appointing Kiffin, USC said, “So what? Bring it.”
Kiffin said Wednesday his top priority would be “a dedication to running a clean and disciplined program,” but that comes just a month after he said he took the NCAA’s investigation of Tennessee’s recruiting tactics as a compliment of his prowess with swaying star prospects. Somehow, I think USC’s compliance office has probably had its fill of such compliments already.
Another lesson Kiffin will have to learn is how to interact with his peers in college football without playing the role of the gnat. He repeatedly irked his fellow coaches in the SEC so badly that, as Ben Volin of the Palm Beach Post wrote on his Twitter, “Lane Kiffin did in one day what [SEC commissioner] Mike Slive couldn’t do in eight years: unify the SEC.”
But if you don’t want to believe a journalist’s depiction of Kiffin’s ways, take it from a rapper. On his song “Banned from TV,” Lil Wayne boasted that he could “talk s— like Lane Kiffin.” Upon being informed of the reference, Kiffin said that he enjoyed it because it boosted his program’s “street cred.”
Of course, that street cred comment looked a lot worse when, less than a month later, Kiffin had to boot two players from the program for being charged with armed robbery. But hey, maybe it means there could be change afoot for the Trojans’ pregame song.
No doubt Kiffin knows that there are coaches in the Pac-10 who will gladly trade jabs with him. With UCLA coach Rick Neuheisel and Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh all running wild, there’s the potential for there to be more poking among Pac-10 coaches than a bunch of teenage girls on Facebook.
Kiffin was on his best behavior Wednesday evening, save for a slip when he got into a who’s-on-first routine with a reporter about whether recruiting coordinator Ed Orgeron had instructed mid-term enrollees at Tennessee not to go to class to preserve their eligibility.
Maybe Kiffin is a changed man and truly has learned from the past. Maybe his all-star staff is so good that none of his supposed baggage matters. And maybe USC can prosper while playing the villain role in college football.
But if the new L.A. Lane needs to show anything, it’s that he can play by the rules and keep USC afloat. One out of two won’t cut it.
Whatever the case, I hope Kiffin remembers where he left his favorite USC visor, because there’s no switch to turn off that spotlight shining in his face.
Great column. Certainly should keep things interesting in the Pac-10. I wish the Buckeyes could get anothr crack at the Trojans, but I’m planning on seeing the Scarlet & Gray in Arizona on 1/10/11
Nicely done, Schwartz! Can’t wait to see the smack down between this guy and Jim Harbaugh!
“A subtler move would have been replacing the sword-wielding statue of Tommy Trojan with a new version extending the middle finger to everyone not affiliated with USC.” LOL.
It’s not USC vs. the world anymore, it’s like half of USC vs. the world. Did you see how empty the stands were for the UCLA game? How about against Arizona? My guess is that 50,000 show up for opening day. And when USC loses its first game (which it will this year), figure that will drop to 35,000. 
And what is the hype about any of this new staff? Has anyone checked their track records? Kiffin, the Kid, took a program from 5-7 to 7-6. Woo hoo! 5-15 with the Raiders. Ed Orgeron was 10-25 overall as head coach at Ole Miss, going 0-8 in his conference in the final year.  And my guess is that he won’t coach a day at USC. They’ll have to fire him due to the fall out of his calling UT recruits. Kiffin, the Dad, is 69. Jesus Christ, he is 69!!!  Do you think he is going to be that effective?
My guess is that USC goes 8-4 or worse next year. Scratch the BCS, scratch the top 25, hello Emerald Bowl again.
wait…since when hasnt it been us vs the world? lol! if this season has shown one thing, the other PAC 10 teams and the rest of the NCAA hates us. We have been playing the villian, why change it up. only in 2010, our players will have something to prove, and we will be playing with a chip on our shoulder for the first time in years. Probably not smart to get in our way.
Our football program has been “playing the villain” since we won a share of the national title in 2003.  I think Lane will feel right at home here, even before he starts the trash talking.  Good luck to our boys despite the regime change.

New coach Lane Kiffin made his return to USC on Wednesday night to address the media in Heritage Hall where he promised a new era for Trojan football, but the controversy he had been associated with since he left the school in 2007 wasn’t far behind him.
Strong statement · Lane Kiffin, who has only one full season of collegiate coaching under his belt, returned to USC campus on Wednesday, promising a clean football program focused on recruiting talent. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Kiffin, who announced his resignation from the top position at the University of Tennessee late Tuesday, took a flight from Knoxville, Tenn. to Los Angeles midday Wednesday to officially accept the position from Athletic Director Mike Garrett.
Kiffin left Knoxville on Tuesday night in the midst of rioting in the Tennessee area following his short announcement to the media that he was taking the job at USC, and replacing Pete Carroll, who moved on to the NFL to coach the Seattle Seahawks.
In 14 short months, Kiffin and his staff made an impact on Tennessee football — turning a 5-7 team into a 7-6 team — yet he and his staff left in the midst of what looked like a team headed in the right direction.
“The decision was one that was not easy for us, we thought a lot about it,” Kiffin said. “We’re very grateful [to Tennessee], but it became very obvious that when we had the opportunity to come back here, we were coming back home.”
Kiffin spoke directly about recruiting and developing team members in his introductory press conference, saying that if USC is able to recruit the best players, they should expect to perform at the highest levels of college football.
“We want an emphasis on developing players,” Kiffin said. “I really believe that it’s the development of the players and the developments of student athletes that this staff can accomplish.”
Kiffin also talked about his return to the program where he got his first major break as tight ends coach during the 2001 season.
Kiffin’s father, Monte Kiffin, who will join the Trojan staff as defensive coordinator, recognized the appeal of USC and returning to familiar territory.
“This is a unique place,” the elder Kiffin said. “[Lane] knows the lay of the land, he came up here [with Carroll].”
The new Trojan coach arrived with his entire family in tow and immediately set out goals for the program. With NCAA investigations looming over possible violations surrounding Joe McKnight and Reggie Bush, Kiffin was intent on running a spotless program.
“The first thing we’re going to do is have a dedication to running a clean program,” Kiffin said.
Just hours after the announcement of Kiffin’s decision, rumors began to swirl about the coach and his new staff.
Kiffin also took along recruiting coordinator and defensive line coach Ed Orgeron to be a major player in his Trojan staff as part of his agreement to come back to USC after a three-year absence.
According to various sources, including the New York Times, Orgeron spent much of Tuesday contacting potential Tennessee recruits trying to lure them away from the Volunteers — and possibly to the Trojans along with the new coaching staff.
Orgeron and Kiffin, however, denied any wrongdoing, stating that they did not actively encourage recruits to decommit from the Volunteers.
“I always try to drive recruits in the right direction, all I did was explain options to the families that called me,” Orgeron said.
Despite the controversy, Kiffin felt that his time at Tennessee had prepared him well for what he called his “dream job” at USC.
“Being at Tennessee prepared me for what we have here; the microscope at a top-10 or -15 program is as strong,” Kiffin said.
When asked whether he sees this staff as an extension of the departing Carroll regime that was so successful in its nine seasons, Kiffin was quick to recognize the unparalleled success the Trojans have seen over the past few years.
“If we can go to seven straight BCS bowls, with a 6-1 record, then I’d love to be connected with [Carroll’s years],” Kiffin said.
Kiffin is about to be immortalized at Tennessee.  There is a
 big push to have a sewage treatment plant named after him.
On February 5, 2009, Kiffin accused Urban Meyer, the head coach of the Florida Gators, of violating NCAA recruiting rules at Tennessee Booster breakfast at the Knoxville Convention Center.[20]
“ “I’m going to turn Florida in right here in front of you,” Kiffin told the crowd. “As Nu’Keese was here on campus, his phone keeps ringing. And so one of our coaches is sitting in the meeting with him and says, ‘Who is that?’ And he looks at the phone and says, ‘Urban Meyer.’
“Just so you know, you can’t call a recruit on another campus. But I love the fact that Urban had to cheat and still didn’t get him.”[20]
 ” 
While Kiffin was accusing Meyer of violating NCAA rules, he was actually violating Southeastern Conference rules himself and his accusations of Meyer’s conduct being against NCAA rules was incorrect.[20] Southeastern Conference commissioner Mike Slive issued a public reprimand to Kiffin over the comments.[21] In addition to the public reprimand by Slive, Florida Athletic Director Jeremy Foley issued a statement demanding an public apology from Kiffin.[22]
Kiffin issued a public apology a day after the remarks. In a statement released by the University of Tennessee, Kiffin said, “In my enthusiasm for our recruiting class, I made some statements that were meant solely to excite those at the breakfast. If I offended anyone at the University of Florida, including Mr. Foley and Urban Meyer, I sincerely apologize. That was not my intention.”[23]
During the same speech on February 5, Kiffin said he ordered high school recruit Nu’Keese Richardson to fax his signing papers from somewhere other than Pahokee High, because: “…somebody at the school was going to screw it up, the fax machine wouldn’t work or they would have changed the signatures. All the things that go on in Pahokee now.” [24] According to Pahokee Head Coach Blaze Thompson, Kiffin promised a public apology for these and other remarks [25], but has not delivered.
On February 13, 2009 on a Knoxville radio show, Kiffin referred to Bryce Brown as a “great player,” which the university plans to self-report as a secondary recruiting violation [26] since NCAA rules prohibit coaches from publicly commenting on recruitable athletes.
In late February 2009, Kiffin was accused of denigrating the Georgia Bulldogs recruiting efforts in the state of Georgia on a talk radio show with the Rivals network. The University of Georgia Athletic Director Damon Evans responded that the program does not need to cheat to have success.[27][28]
According to ESPN’s Chris Low “Kiffin told recruit Alshon Jeffrey that if he chose the Gamecocks, he would end up pumping gas for the rest of his life like all the other players from that state who had gone to South Carolina.”[29][30] Kiffin denies ever making that statement.[31] However the incident was corroborated by Alshon Jeffrey’s coach Walter Wilson who was listening to Kiffin’s remarks on speakerphone.[32][33][34]
USC better hope kiffin puts on a trojan cause your school is about to get screwed—-Al Davis was right.
I am probably one of the few Trojan alums who is NOT at all impressed and happy with the hire of kiffin.  This guy really gives USC a black eye reputation, and he’s already committed an infraction along with ed orgeron prior tp coming to SC. Mike garrett needs to get his head examined, and hopefully, gets fired as the AD within a few years.  I just don’t like the sheep-mentality that a lot of Trojans have when someone like kiffin is hired.  I really wish that we were going to get jack del rio as a headcoach. He’s more of a clean person with a good track record.  He’s also not as charismatic and encouraging as pete carroll was.  Honestlly, Jack Del Rio or Norm Chow would have been a better selection as a head coach for USC.
To run a clean program, hire a 34-year-old guy with more NCAA violations than most 50 year old coaches… multiple of which are recruiting related. FAIL.
Al Davis was right….
if JR ever retires, he would be a great coach
JR announced on Inside the NFL this week that he plans to retire.
How about Junior Seau for Linebackers coach?
sad SEC fans come on to a USC news letter distributed to USC students and fans in LA to parret the same bitter anger of losing their coach. The  guy has every right to pursue what he wants when the opportunity is there. Get over it and move forward like adults. 
Go USC
Congratulations on snagging a coach with an overall losing record. I give him 3 years tops with all of them being mediocre. He’s also incapable of following NCAA guidelines, so expect the NCAA violations to continue. The only thing he has going for him is daddy. Prepare to suck it, Trojan football.
I’m guessing yer’ a fan of the SEC….

In an attempt to keep up with a rapidly evolving media landscape, the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism is developing a new initiative to add courses encompassing the economic and entrepreneurial aspects of communication and journalism.
Keeping up · Annenberg will add economics courses to its curriculum to help prepare students to be at the forefront of the media revolution. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
Though the names and timelines of many of the courses are still unknown, it is an initiative referred to as Economic Literacy and Entrepreneurship, and Annenberg faculty said they believe ELE courses will maintain the school’s commitment to consistency and cutting-edge education.
“We want to try to promote global critical thinking: how to think of this rapidly changing market and empower the students to be market creators,” said Clinical Associate Professor Christopher Smith, who is heavily involved in the development of the ELE initiative. “We want them to be big media magnets of the 21st century.”
Before the financial crisis, the journalism world was already suffering, making an economic education even more important for those entering the media realm.
“This is very important in the communication world,” said School of Journalism Director Geneva Overholser. “The communication and journalism world certainly is changing, so we have a sense of urgency that others will feel down the line.”
Smith says it’s important for Annenberg students to not only know the ins and outs of journalism and communication, but to also understand the economic media landscape.
“The institutional structure that defined the 20th century is going away,” Smith said. “We want our school to be on the leading edge of what the new structure will be.”
Though Annenberg already had numerous courses in the economic realm, those backing the ELE initiative hope creating a more focused program will give all students a stronger economic foundation.
“In the present circumstances, it’s important for all our students to understand basic economic principles,” said the School of Communication Director Larry Gross. “A great deal of what goes on, what works and what doesn’t, what flourishes and what doesn’t in these technological areas depends on their ability to succeed economically.”
Though Annenberg maintains strong relationships with all USC schools, including the Marshall School of Business, they are looking to hire entirely new faculty to teach these courses.
“We are definitely in touch with the Marshall School,” said Abigail Kaun, Annenberg associate dean of academic programs and student affairs. “There’s a proposal in the works for a curriculum partnership at the graduate level, but our main focus is what we should be teaching within Annenberg.”
As for making ELE courses a requirement, nothing is set in stone.
“None of that is finalized,” Kaun said. “In the years to come, we may find that there is a required course for Annenberg students, but now we’re working on getting classes off the ground for the fall.”
One ELE class is already up and running this semester­ — COMM 499, Economic Principles for Communication and Journalism,. The class has had a low student turnout, but Professor Ergin Bayrak expects that, as time passes, student interest will increase.
“It’s pretty new and unexpected for the students,” Bayrak said. “We’re trying to get them to understand that economic literacy is important. It will also help them be better and more well-informed citizens.”
Though the classes have not been promoted heavily, an ELE Facebook group has formed, and there are currently about 10 students enrolled in Bayrak’s class. Administrators and professors hope word of ELE will soon spread.
“We hope from word of mouth and more exposure that this will gain students’ interest,” Bayrak said.
Annenberg faculty agree the new program will leave students better prepared for the future and will make Annenberg students more competitive in the job market.
“[Employers] definitely prefer someone who knows about economics,” Bayrak said. “They need people who understand the causes and repercussions of economic changes. In media and communications, they are even more interested in people who know economics because of the effect economics has on the industry.”
Of the ELE courses, faculty said they are looking for student input.
“We want to emphasize student input on this in terms of curriculum development and what the Annenberg school can be doing to be more valuable to students,” Kaun said. “It would not be wise to ignore that valuable input.”
I wish this was an initiative in place while I was a student at Annenberg.  I agree that this necessary for all the undergrads and hope that those with an emphasis in journalism and communication will take the class.
And knowing Annenberg, I’m sure they’ll be open-minded about theories and methods taught.
Knowing Annenberg, it’ll probably be all about Keynesian economics and how borrowing money is the best way to get out of debt.
[…] Annenberg curriculum moving to incorporate economic literacy … […]

Though student political involvement has dropped off significantly since the 2008 presidential election, campus political activists are hoping the upcoming gubernatorial race will reignite student interest in politics, and campus groups are making plans to help rekindle the political spark.
Taking sides · Members of USC College Democrats and USC College Republicans will hold a debate this semester leading up to the primaries. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
With the race for the chance to govern one of the country’s most troubled states picking up steam this spring, USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, the Political Student Assembly, USC College Democrats and USC College Republicans all have plans to draw students back into the political realm.
Student involvement has been at a lull since San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom dropped out of the governor’s race. When Newsom’s campaign was still active, USC hosted a chapter of Students for Gavin Newsom. Now there is no visible support for any other specific candidate.
“Newsom was the only candidate whose campaign devoted a lot of attention and energy to campus organizing,” said Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute. “My guess is that’s about to change.”
Shena Popat, director of the Political Student Assembly, said she anticipates students will become more active after the June primaries. She emphasized, however, that it is equally important for students to be involved in the primary elections.
“In order to increase student involvement, there may be informative, non-partisan events presenting the platforms of the candidates with regard to issues important to students,” Popat said.
Party-specific groups have also made plans to try to increase student involvement in politics this semester, including a debate between the USC College Democrats and the USC College Republicans leading up to the primaries.
USC College Democrats will attempt to draw in students by hosting a welcome back party, phone banking and sending a large group to the California Democratic Convention, which will be held in Los Angeles,  Vice President Aaron Perman said.
USC College Republicans will host several speakers this semester, including Republican National Committee Chairman Shawn Steele. They will also hold the California College Republican Convention in April, according to Alexa Ekman, president of USC College Republicans.
Though the College Democrats will pick a specific candidate to endorse, College Republicans will not. Still, Ekman said involvement in the gubernatorial race is crucial, particularly for college students.
“Although USC is private and therefore unaffected by the state budget costs, students must pay attention to this election because the debt that California exhibits will be placed on our generation,” she said.
The Unruh Institute will be continuing the Students Talk Back lunch series, panel discussions co-hosted by the Daily Trojan, which give students a chance to discuss politics with experts.
The institute will also sponsor a viewing of the president’s State of the Union address and will host a daylong concert series partnership with USC’s School of Policy, Planning, and Development and the Los Angeles Times.
The poll series developed by the Unruh Institute and the Los Angeles Times will also continue as the gubernatorial race marches on.  Schnur said there will be at least two polls released before the primary elections in June.
“This semester we plan on involving students in the planning of these polls and the analysis of the poll results,” Schnur said. “We want our students to know how the process works and get a better understanding of how public opinion is measured in a political campaign.”
Schnur said the key is to get involved now.
“For me and my generational colleagues, we only have a certain number of years left before it’s somebody else’s turn,” he said. “The young people who are smart enough and energetic enough to get involved early are the ones who are going to make the greatest impact.”
Oh, he’s the RNC’s Committeeman representing California. So, which Steele is coming to USC?
The RNC chairman is Michael Steele. I don’t know who Shawn Steele is.
