The White House announced the launch of the It’s On Us public awareness campaign Friday morning. The campaign is a collaborative effort intended to help prevent sexual assault on college campuses.
In Friday’s speech, President Barack Obama emphasized that survivors of sexual assault are not alone.
“This is not your fight alone,” Obama said. “This is on all of us, every one of us, to fight campus sexual assault.”
It’s On Us is a partnership with nearly 200 colleges, sports organizations like the NCAA and private companies with ties to colleges and universities.
Student body representatives at USC echoed Obama’s conviction.
“It’s not a men’s issue, it’s not a women’s issue, it’s not a Greek issue, it’s a campus-wide human rights issue,” Undergraduate Student Government Vice President Rini Sampath said.
At USC, It’s On Us will take place in conjunction with the Trojans Respect Consent campaign. Trojans Respect Consent is a Greek-centered campaign USG plans to launch in the coming weeks. According to Sampath, Greek students can display the Trojans Respect Consent emblem online, customized to the organization’s name and colors, in order to promote awareness of the issue. Greek students can display the emblem if more than 80 percent of members attend sexual assault education seminars.
Though Trojans Respect Consent currently has a Greek focus, representatives hope to expand it to other student organizations.
“The final goal is to have all organizations attend seminars on sexual assault,” Sampath said.
According to the White House blog, an estimated one in five American college women are assaulted. Of those assaults, only 12 percent are reported and only a fraction of reports lead to punishment.
Some universities have established their own initiatives to fight sexual assault. In particular, The Survivor Outreach and Support Campus Act, implemented by the University of California system, has received national attention and praise.
“There’s no doubt that colleges and universities have to step up their game. They have to take legal responsibility, and it’s a moral obligation to respect their students and hold perpetrators accountable,” Vice President Joe Biden said.
One of the goals of It’s On Us is getting men, particularly male students, involved in the issue.
Patrick Quah, a graduate student studying interactive media, said that he hopes It’s On Us will combat misconceptions about men and sexual assault.
“I think it’s presumptuous to say we have to ‘protect’ the opposite sex. I don’t think that’s the case at all –— it’s  about policing our own gender and holding ourselves accountable,” Quah said.
Obama stressed that society must change for the reforms to be effective.
“From sports leagues to pop culture to politics, our society still does not sufficiently value women,” he said.
Quah worried about the transparency of the reporting process.
“I think it’s a great thing to be taken to a federal level, although I think the main challenges will be that a lot of this is unseen and underreported, so transparency could still be an issue,” Quah said.

On Monday afternoon, the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering held a memorial service in honor of late staff member Mary Francis.
Taking flight · People gathered together for Mary Francis’s service released red ballons into the air to symbolize letting go of grief. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Francis, a budget analyst for the Viterbi School of Engineering, worked at the school for 13 years before she passed away on June 22, 2014.
The memorial service included Francis’s mother, as well as her colleagues and students that were touched by her kindness throughout her time at Viterbi.
Gloria Halfacre, who is part of the signal and image processing staff at Viterbi and was one of Francis’ closest colleagues at the electrical engineering department, said that the school decided to postpone the memorial until the fall so that students and faculty would be able to pay their respects.
Shrikanth S. Narayan, a Viterbi professor, delivered a few words of remembrance during the service.
“Mary was extremely caring — personally, it’s been a huge loss for me,” Narayan said.
He went on to describe how he would look forward to their conversations early in the day.
“I miss that every morning,” Narayan said.
After a conference Narayan’s students participated in Singapore this year, the team dedicated all their research papers to Francis.
Francis was diagnosed with stage-four lung cancer in early 2014. Several of the students that were close with Francis immediately formed a group to assist her. All Francis had to do was text the group, and one of the students would immediately come to help her.
One of the students in that group was Dogan Can, a Ph.D. candidate in computer science. Can recalled Francis’s attitude during her illness.
“She was physically different but her personality was the same,” Can said.
He recalled that when some of the 16 students in the group visited Francis at the hospital, she would cut visits short by pretending to be tired when the topic of her illness would come up. Can said that Francis did not want others to feel awkward.
“That was just the kind of person she was, completely selfless,” Can said.
Even though the cancer had already spread through her body by the time of the diagnosis, people around said she remained the upbeat, positive and helpful person she always was.
Matthew Black, who graduated with a Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 2012, remembered Francis for her kindness and warmth.
“She was kind of like a mother figure to me,” he said. “The joke with engineers is that we try to avoid people at all times, but I kind of went out of my way to talk to her.”
The final goodbye to Francis came when all of the guests released red balloons into the sky in her memory.
“Releasing the balloons symbolizes the soul taking flight to heaven and letting go of grief,” Halfacre said.

The Political Student Assembly, in collaboration with the USC College Democrats and the Women’s Student Assembly, brought Sandra Fluke, the Democratic candidate for the California State Senate, to speak to students Monday evening for a discussion about the value of female leadership and Fluke’s experience in politics.
On the stump · Fluke, who gained national attention after testifying in a congressional committee about access to contraceptives, is running as a Democratic candidate for the California state senate. – Zhiliang Zhao | Daily Trojan
Fluke, who was the first in her father’s family to go to college, enrolled at Cornell University and took a women’s studies class, which she said changed her view of the way gender discrimination continues to play a role in society.
“College opened up my whole world to the career I wanted to have in social justice as an advocate,” she said.
Fluke first gained national attention as a law student at Georgetown University. She chose a career in law in order to better understand and work with those who faced adversity. While at Georgetown, Fluke became active with a group of students in calling for greater reproductive rights for women, using Georgetown’s poor contraceptive coverage as an example.
Congressional Republicans denied a Democratic bid for her to testify at a Feb. 16, 2012 hearing on a possible government requirement of employers to provide insurance coverage for birth control. The Democrats held an unofficial hearing a week later, and Fluke testified about the difficulty of obtaining contraception coverage at Georgetown.
On Feb. 29 of that year, Rush Limbaugh called Fluke a “sl-t” on his nationally broadcast radio show. He later apologized, but Fluke has chosen to remain in the public eye through her activism.
“In my final semester of law school, karma caught up with me, and my career changed rather abruptly,” Fluke said. “If you find the spotlight shining on you for one moment, you grab the microphone and start screaming.”
Since then, she has advocated for reproductive rights and affordable healthcare, and she is mounting a bid for California State Senate.
Fluke remains focused on policy outcomes, and attributes some of Obamacare’s contraceptive protections to the activism and controversy that she and her peers generated at Georgetown.
“I’m not sure we would have the policy that we have in the Affordable Care Act if we didn’t have the attention generated by that controversy,” she said.
Fluke is also determined to increase the representation of women and other diverse groups in elected office.
“When I get into the Senate, I fully intend to immediately begin thinking, ‘Who else can I bring with me?’ My style is going to be kicking down the doors and bringing the community in,” she said.
Fluke describes her campaign as being funded by “average sized bank accounts,” with a mean contribution of around $250. She cites this as a reason why her campaign is part of the movement to bring diversity to Sacramento.
Fluke said the most significant challenge that California faces is Proposition 13, a ballot measure passed in 1978 that placed a cap on the real estate tax and required a two-thirds vote in both houses of the state legislature to ever increase taxes again. The proposition has severely limited how much the state can collect in revenue each year.
Fluke said the proposition has unfairly benefited companies at the expense of individuals and has hampered the government’s ability to raise revenue for important public works projects.
“It contains of tons of loopholes that benefit corporations,” she said. “It has put a stranglehold on our ability to fund important investments and cut off a lot of resources to things like public education, and it makes it very difficult for the legislature to have the flexibility that they need to have to change tax policy.”
Fluke plans to close tax loopholes that benefit corporations and make it easier to reform taxes in the future.
Logan Burkhead, a junior majoring in political science, said Fluke is an inspiration for student’s looking to become activists in politics.
“Fluke’s presentation thoughtfully articulated the importance of combining passion with an unabashed commitment to action,” he said. “She inspired students to make their own voices heard and to fight injustice in their own lives.”
Hey kids. Ms. Fluke is uninformed about Prop 13. Pac was voted o on by the voters odd CA to signified slow down the rising real estate tax burden on the home owner  population of CA. Without P13 most homeowners would’ve been force to sell their homes due to not being able to pay the real estate taxes. This law is not a corporate welfare law but one that saved millions of home owners from losing their homes. 
Since CA had a spending problem,  perhaps a better solution is to stop funding illegal activities such add providing all of the free benefits to illegals,  who only pay state sales tax andgenerally,  no state income tax.  When less than half the population pays icons taxes,  their is a problem,  but it is not solved by making folks paying more. It is solved by spending less.

A well-stocked pantry is my weeknight dinner savior, and it should be yours, too. Peanut butter, mixed nuts, Dijon mustard, sea salt and good olive oil are just a few items that I keep on-hand at all times. You won’t find any Cup of Noodles tucked into my cabinets; the Epicurean Dorm is a strict ramen-free zone.
Convenient and delicious · Since the beans in these recipes come pre-cooked, the preparation only takes a few minutes, but the stew still has the richness and flavor of one that requires hours of preparation. — Maral Tavitian | Daily Trojan
This week’s recipes celebrate one of my most-used pantry staples: canned beans. Despite their humble appearance, canned beans provide an ideal base for simple yet spectacular vegetarian soups. All you need are some fresh vegetables, a splash of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to elevate a can of beans into a healthy and satisfying meal. Since the beans are pre-cooked, the dish comes together in just a few minutes but still possesses the lavishness and the rich, deep flavor of a stew that has simmered for hours.
Stewed chickpeas with carrots and kale is a light, Mediterranean-inspired dish that pairs nicely with brown rice or toasted pita. Feel free to swap in white beans and spinach, or throw in a handful of cherry tomatoes for an extra burst of sweetness. While a dusting of grated Parmesan provides a luxurious, saline finish, you could eliminate the cheese for a completely vegan entrée.
My minimalist pinto bean chili will indulge your cravings for Mexican food without the guilt. Though most chili recipes require cumin, chili powder and other ingredients that college students rarely use, this version allows the toppings to do the work. Sliced avocado, sour cream and cheddar cheese are a few classics, but the pinto bean base will complement a diverse range of toppings.
Once you nail the bean-vegetable-liquid ratio, you can adapt the basic formula using different ingredients. It is important to season liberally and frequently with salt and pepper, tasting as you go. No matter the combination, there is no better way to welcome brisk fall weather than with a quick, comforting and home-cooked soup.

Spearheaded by their hit single “Breezeblocks,” Alt-J’s debut album An Awesome Wave initially had both fans and critics raving over the uniquely 21st-century sound cultivated by the four lads from Leeds. Eager to crown them the next big thing, many compared the four to a certain other group of introverted Englishmen who have also been playing music together since their school days. Back then, they went by the name On A Friday, but most people today know them as Radiohead. Sure, lead singer Joe Newman’s penchant for falsetto recalls post-The Bends Thom Yorke and both groups are influenced by trip hop/IDM acts like DJ Shadow, Massive Attack and Aphex Twin, but so was almost every major British rock musician who was coming up in the ’90s. Newman himself has said that he feels these comparisons and expectations are premature. He is quick to dispel them by citing Alt-J’s lone musical output in comparison to others’ long and consistent careers. Yet, for whatever reason, it feels like there is a disproportionate effort being made to contextualize Alt-J in relation to other bands and speculate on their longevity. This cacophony of hypercritical prophesizing has proven itself to be entirely superfluous to the music itself, mostly unsubstantiated and ultimately detrimental to new fans approaching Alt-J.
Smorgasbord of sound · This Is All Yours features an exciting spectrum of songs by the Leodensian band. Their secret track cover of Bill Withers’ “Lovely Day” at the very end is an especially rousing piece. – Maral Tavitian | Daily Trojan
On the first album, the band’s experiments in non-English lyricism, apparent fixation on triangles (as evidenced by their name, which is a keyboard shortcut for ∆) and subtle references to the book Where the Wild Things Are and the film Léon: The Professional all served to form a unique aesthetic identity. Barely two years removed from their debut, though, it now seems that many of Alt-J’s idiosyncrasies have become gimmicks in the eyes of critics. For the most part, this is due to hipsters’ (read: Pitchfork’s) aversion to anything popular. As the group continues to convert more and more Mumford & Sons/Ed Sheeran-type listeners, it is simultaneously losing the respect of the bloggers and critics who champion the underground and undiscovered. Such an inverse relationship between record sales and underground critical acclaim is only heightened by the fact that they were awarded the Mercury Prize for Best British Album of 2012. Perhaps it is all of this pressure and denigration that led to the supposedly amicable departure of bassist Gwil Sainsbury (for an example of such wanton abuse, see The Guardian’s January article “Alt-J: what happens when a bland band loses an anonymous member?”). Considering all that has happened and all that has been predicted to happen to the band since their debut, there is a great deal riding on this sophomore effort. With This Is All Yours, the newly slimmed-down outfit delivered a lush set of tracks that surprises without straying too far from their formula.
This Is All Yours immediately harkens back to An Awesome Wave by starting with another “Intro.” It’s a slow-burning chorale done in classic Alt-J style — only this time on a grander scale. The staccato vocals of Newman and keyboardist Gus Unger-Hamilton slowly multiply into a grandiose chant in which each voice cycles through acting as the kick, snare or hi-hat of a syncopated drumbeat. This slowly builds up to a “drop” executed by the actual drums (and distinctive array of woodblocks, anvils, shakers, tambourines, etc.) of percussionist Thom Green. This song sets the tone for the rest of the album — many such climactic moments are to come.
Perhaps the most recognizable remnant of the first album is “Bloodflood, Pt. II.” The song takes lyrics from tracks such as “Fitzpleasure” and “Bloodflood” from their first album and lays them in a more fuller bed of horns and piano. New lyrics placed between resurfacings of old characters such as the Mandela Boys — a gang from Newman’s hometown of Southampton — add an additional dimension to their evolving story. Lyrically, Newman’s fondness of short, simple sentecnes and pithy observations is on display more than ever before.
Hardly a carbon copy, there are some refreshing departures from their established blueprint. In particular, the new album incorporates some distinctive feminine voices. Much has been made of the Miley Cyrus sample on “Hunger of the Pine,” which was released alongside the Black Keys-esque “Left Hand Free” a couple months before the album dropped in its entirety. After a few minutes of ambient build-up, the sampled line “I’m a female rebel” kicks in, sounding like it was taken directly out of James Blake’s repertoire. The most memorable female voice, however, occurs on the track “Warm Foothills,” perhaps the album’s crowning achievement. The track features English female folk singers Lianne La Havas and Marika Hackman, as well as Bright Eyes’ Conor Oberst. Rather than giving each their own verse or chorus, the guests trade off every other word with Newman and Unger-Hamilton, creating a mesmerizing hocketing effect that recalls fellow indie rockers Dirty Projectors. It will be very interesting to see how they attempt to recreate this effect in a live setting.
“The Gospel of John Hurt” provides another high point. Midway through the elegiac sparsity, the straight 4/4 backbeat seamlessly morphs into a triplet-based 6/8 feel. Moments like this are sure to please the casual music fan as well as the discerning listener. The tracks “Arrival in Nara” and “Pusher,” however, will just as surely become fodder for critics to cite as evidence of the band’s blandness. They seem to have half of the formula: lush harmonies and dramatic swells, but no emphatic entrance of drums or bass. Both prove ultimately disappointing. Still, even when they disappoint, they do it in an interesting way. “Arrival in Nara” experiments with string arrangements, robot voices, bird sounds and a left-to-right panning fly buzz that will have those listening on headphones searching around the room for the source.
As an epilogue, the record has  a secret track: an astonishing cover of Bill Withers’ “Lovely Day.” Alt-J take Robert Glasper’s vocoder-infused interpretation further into the electronic realm; the original tune is almost unrecognizable beneath the wall of synths and bass — that is, until the triumphant chorus hits like a ton of bricks.
It’s hard to believe that a band like this could be considered bland, or that there would ever be an overabundance of “folk-step” bands, that is the state of the music industry today. It does make some sense, though. It seems like almost all pop music today falls into one of two categories: foot-stomping folk a la The Lumineers or bass-heavy dance music from DJ’s like Diplo and David Guetta. Alt-J is just one of few groups who have been placed somewhere in the middle. In light of this, This Is All Yours feels like an appropriate title. It is a recognition that they only have power over the music. After they put it out into the world, they can’t control others’ projections, extrapolations or comparisons. They’re not trying to be the new Gomez, the new James Blake or the new Radiohead. And this newfound autonomy comes through in the puzzlingly polarizing group’s impressive sophomore effort.

The Pac-12 is no stranger to talented quarterbacks this year — Oregon signal caller Marcus Mariota sits atop ESPN’s 2014 Heisman Watch rankings as the favorite to win college football’s most prestigious individual award, with UCLA’s Brett Hundley still (somewhat) in the mix. Then there are the old hands: Arizona State’s Taylor Kelly and Oregon State’s Sean Mannion are both projected to be drafted by the NFL, with nfldraftscout.com pegging Mannion as the number one pro quarterback prospect in the NFL Draft class of 2015.
This Saturday, the Trojans will face off against the Oregon State Beavers, or as one of my NFL fan friends called it, “Sean Mannion versus that other guy.” Mike Sherrard on this past weekend’s ABC 7 Sports Zone said USC’s quarterback, redshirt junior Cody Kessler, was good at “managing the game,” and a handful of folks on message boards and in bars around Los Angeles have taken to labeling the Trojan quarterback as a game manager.
Praising a quarterback for “managing the game” is a bit of a backhanded compliment (for the record, Sherrard attended UCLA). It elicits portrayals of a quarterback as lacking the dominant qualities of greater players who have the capability to transcend the game.  Calling USC’s quarterback a game manager is essentially declaring that the quarterback plays “not to lose.”
The best example of this in the NFL is Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith. In his tenure with the San Francisco 49ers, Smith was constantly referred to as a game manager, a player who depended on the efforts of his defense and a strong rushing attack to secure victory. In the event that Smith was called upon to throw the ball, it usually entailed a pass on an intricately designed intermediate route, or dumping off the ball to one of his receivers or Frank Gore in the backfield and praying to the yardage gods. The game manager has simple tasks: protect the ball and play within his capabilities.
So it’s not shocking to hear that backhanded compliment appended to Kessler. Overshadowed by the brilliant play of redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen and the Trojans’ rushing attack, it’s easy to see from last season why Kessler might be seen as a game manager. Here’s a quarterback who works hard, goes through his progressions and isn’t afraid to throw the check down for a smaller gain. No, he’s not a riverboat gambler who jacks bombs into El Paso winds only to end up putting one touchdown on the board against a pretty suspect Georgia Tech defense, i.e. former USC quarterback Max Wittek.
I want to point us to a different bowl game that signifies Kessler’s throwing capabilities: the Fresno State game from last season, when Kessler offered up this stat line: 345 yards on 22-for-30 passing with four touchdowns and one interception. One of those touchdowns was a 40-yard completion that literally fell into the lap of wide receiver Nelson Agholor, and the other was a nicely executed fade route from 17 yards that found its way to Agholor’s left shoulder despite the wide receiver being blanketed by a cornerback. The game set a surprising tone and should have silenced any muttering of Kessler being a game manager, but the perception persists.
When USC’s rushing attack fell apart against those crafty Boston College front seven schemes, USC looked to Kessler to bail them out. Despite being repeatedly sacked, Kessler played a damn near flawless game: 317 yards on 31-for-41 with four touchdowns and zero interceptions. The argument then became that Kessler didn’t do enough to win, which is ridiculous.
Part of the problem lies in the offensive system, not the playcalling — once again, the Trojans find themselves in trouble due to a thin roster, and the run-first game plan serves not only as a way to keep defenders honest, but also to bleed out the clock to shorten the overall game. Kessler has managed his stellar offensive statistics this season despite these constraints.
Cody Kessler is not a game manager, unless you’re referring to the fact that he has a whopping zero interceptions and a 71 percent completion percentage this season. But game managers don’t have four-touchdown games with a Total QBR 8.4 points higher than that Heisman Trophy candidate on the other side of town. This Saturday’s game is not “Sean Mannion versus that other guy,” but rather a genuine quarterback battle between two of the Pac-12’s most talented signal callers. Kessler belongs in the conversation of elite Pac-12 quarterbacks, and look no further than Saturday for the Bakersfield, California native to make his case.

Alex Smith was used as a game manager in SF, but is doing more under a more aggressive Andy Reid. Harbaugh was conservative in Stanford with Andrew Luck and now with Kaepernick (wasn’t so in 2012 latter half of season).

The USC women’s volleyball team returns to action tonight, hosting crosstown rival UCLA at the Galen Center.
The No. 9 Women of Troy (7-3) have struggled lately, losing both of their matches in the USC Classic earlier this month and dropping another contest to fifth-ranked Wisconsin in last week’s Pac-12/Big Ten Showcase.

USC did pick up a win in its last match, a sweep of Maryland. The victory was the 350th of head coach Mick Haley’s career.
“I never really paid much attention to that stuff,” Haley said. “It’s always been about the next match, and that’s the way you live your life … I don’t know if [350] is a good number or not. I have been here 14 years, and it’s a good look to see how we have been doing.”
No. 20 UCLA (9-2) has a better record than its archrival but has only briefly matched up against the top competition that USC has faced thus far. The Bruins’ two losses this season have come against Loyola Marymount and Penn State, the then-No. 1 Nittany Lions being the only ranked team on the Bruins’ non-conference schedule.
Outside hitter Karsta Lowe and setter Julie Consani have led the charge for the Bruins thus far. Lowe leads the team in kills with 191 and also has an excellent hitting percentage of .368. The leader of the offense is Consani, who distributes the ball extremely well to her hitters. In 11 matches, she has 414 assists, approximately 12 assists a game.
UCLA’s freshman outside hitter Olga Strantzali is also making herself known early in her young career. Strantzali, originally from Greece, has a .302 hitting percentage and is tied for the team lead in aces with 10.
USC holds a slim advantage in the series against the Bruins with a 54-46 all-time record. The Women of Troy are 5-2 against the Bruins in seven seasons at the Galen Center, which is only hosting this week’s showdown due to odd circumstances. The match was originally supposed to be played in Westwood, but the teams agreed to switch games after this summer’s flooding at UCLA’s campus.
This rivalry is so unique and heated that the girls always want to come out on top. Senior outside hitter Emily Young is no stranger to this heated matchup and enjoys the chance to play against the Bruins.
“UCLA is one of the most fun rivalries,” Young said. “There are a lot players from Southern California that know each other and our schools are so close in proximity. You are playing against your really good friends. And it makes it an intense but fun rivalry.”
For the Women of Troy to be successful against their archrival, they will need to improve their blocking and continue to pass well, especially in serve-receive situations. The team will have to rely heavily on sophomore libero Taylor Whittingham and her digging skills in defensive situations.
Sophomore outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu knows that this game will be a battle and that the team has to remain strong.
“We need to be able to come together and when we get down be able to come back,” Nwanebu said. “We have had trouble with that in the three games that we lost. We are getting better at that though, we have been practicing on it and basically having that team bond.”
USC hopes that even with three early season losses under its belt, tests against top-25 opponents will make the team come together and mature as the season progresses.
Either way, the Women of Troy will have their hands full against the Bruins, and it will likely come right down to the wire.

It was a bittersweet weekend for the USC women’s soccer team as they concluded non-conference play with two very different results.
After netting eight goals — then a school record — against UC Riverside only  two weeks before, the No. 15 Women of Troy (6-1-2) rewrote the record books once again and scored nine goals en route to a commanding 9-0 shutout win over Arkansas-Pine Bluff on Friday. The team could not summon that goal-scoring magic two days later, however, in a 2-1 loss to No. 12 Pepperdine.

Against Arkansas Pine-Bluff, the Women of Troy delighted the home crowd with a string of goals, the first five of which came in the match’s opening 20 minutes. The team pleased head coach Keidane McAlpine and fulfilled the coaching staff’s continuing desire to always get off to quick starts.
“We put goals on the board early, which I was very, very pleased with,” McAlpine said. “More importantly we got another shutout.”
It seemed like everyone got a piece of the pie — or the net — as six USC players scored their first ever career goals.
Junior midfielder Jamie Fink and forward Katie Johnson added to their own goal totals by netting one each, while senior midfielder Alex Quincey continued her goal-scoring success and slotted in her team-high sixth of the season.
The match was a success for the Women of Troy, but their true test came against the Waves on Sunday.
Pepperdine came into the match boasting only a single loss to top-ranked UCLA. The Lady Waves were looking to get a fourth straight win and put an end to USC’s unbeaten streak, and they brought a level of physicality and aggressiveness to the match that was immediately evident.
Pepperdine’s quick attack allowed the team to take advantage of the early stages of the match and create several goal-scoring chances, but the Women of Troy weathered the early storm and began to acclimate to the match’s pace by creating scoring chances of their own.
The scoreless draw expired at the 16th minute, however, when a Pepperdine corner kick resulted in a put-back shot goal for the Lady Waves.
Aside from the two record-breaking routs, deficits and closely contested matches have become familiar for the Women of Troy. By halftime, the team had already taken back control of the game. Though they were still down a goal, they were creating scoring chances, and looked poised to equalize at any moment.
That moment arrived in the 52nd minute when a cross by freshman midfielder Sydney Sladek deflected off of Johnson and landed at the feet of senior defender Erin Owen. Owen blasted the shot into the net to tie the game at 1-1 with plenty of time to play.
Neither team wanted to give up a game-winner, but despite gaining confidence to begin the second half, the Women of Troy’s demise arrived in the 66th minute, another by-product of a dangerous set-piece.
Pepperdine forward Lynn Williams — who had five shots in the game — dropped a corner kick in towards senior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley. Stanley got a hand on the ball but could not push it out far enough, and Waves’ forward Taylor Alvarado did not hesitate to slot the loose ball home and give her team the outright lead.
Try as they might, the Women of Troy could not find that familiar equalizer that had helped them stay undefeated to that point. Despite outshooting the Lady Waves 15-4 in the second half, the all-important second goal never materialized. A late free kick taken by Johnson that sailed over the goal snuffed out the remaining hopes for a draw, and the team’s perfection was no more.
“Pepperdine did a really good job of pressuring us once we got the ball,” Owen said. “We had a good buildup, but once we got into the final third it was a little tough to get a shot on frame.”
Aside from the ability to finish, defending set pieces seemed to be the recurring — and somewhat troubling — theme for the Women of Troy in this game, and McAlpine was adamant about the team’s awareness during these plays.
“In high-level games that’s where most of the goals come from,” McAlpine said. “It’s something that you have to be dialed in and locked in on, and we just weren’t for a couple moments today.”
Stanley agreed with her coach’s sentiments.
“[When] you play a better opponent, you don’t get away with little mistakes like that, but I think we’ll clean that up this week,” Stanley said.
With their first conference match less than a week away, however, this game might have been a blessing in disguise to prepare the squad.
“It’s a game that we can grow from, it’s a game we can learn a lot from,” McAlpine said.
The Women of Troy now turn their attention to their conference opener at Arizona this Friday, before returning to McAlister Field for a five-game home stand.

The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s fare hike from $1.50 to $1.75 went into effect last Monday. Despite ardent protests, the board voted on May 22 to implement the hike, a move that will deal a heavy blow to the city’s low-income residents. The fare hike is an attempt to fix issues at the expense of poor passengers without efforts to mitigate the damage.
Irene Wang | Daily Trojan
 
With the original cost of $1.50, the L.A. Metro had the lowest rate among the nation’s major transit systems. San Francisco’s Muni fare is $2, while New York City’s subway fare is $2.50. Yet, unlike either city, Los Angeles is largely a transit system for the poor, with few upscale and middle-class commuters. According to the Los Angeles Times, more than 90 percent of Metro riders are low-income, with the average passenger household making less than $20,000.
The 25 cent increase might look modest at a glance, but the same can’t be said about the $25 increase for the monthly pass used by frequent passengers.
The Metro Board voted to raise fares because a deficit that could reach $225 million in the next decade. Yet, despite that, Metro is still going forward with costly expansion plans that include the construction of five new lines. Ironically, though the expansion is supposed to better the system for riders, the increased operating costs place the burden on loyal passengers who can’t afford to pay more.
Last May, more than 130 people publicly asked Metro directors to change their minds about the fare hike at the final hearing, according to the L.A. Times. For many, the cost of the hike amounts to more than just a mere quarter. Some were in tears as they spoke of having to choose between buying tickets and feeding their families. Riders, regardless of socio-economic status, shouldn’t be forced to make such decisions. It’s almost unbelievable to think that charging the poor more was the best solution Metro Board members could come up with to fix Metro’s financial problems.
The city needs to do more to mitigate this situation for low-income riders, including making it easier for them to find out about the agency’s fare subsidy programs, be it through advertising at train stations and bus stops or stopping by to talk to community groups.
For one, the Metro’s Rider Relief Program allows $10 off a monthly pass. The maximum household income for eligibility is $28,500. And yet, the program is very underused, not only because it’s not advertised as much as it should be, but also because when information is finally found, the application requires appointments with third-party organizations. The hassle is enough to deter many, especially if $10 barely makes up for the $25 increase.
Instead of letting the problem of sustainability fall to the passengers, Metro should not only mitigate the damage, but also fix the issues that have let it come to this. There is no way plugging the budget with money from the large numbers of low-income riders will be a long-term solution.
Despite years of spending and promotion, the biggest issue seems to be failure to diversify Metro ridership. The agency needs find a way to do so — even if it means shifting some of the system’s cost onto drivers to make it less appealing for cars to be on the road. What’s done is done, but that doesn’t mean Metro should make life more difficult for those who are already struggling to make ends meet.

Public transportation regulars will have to bring extra change with them on their commute following the recent hike in Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority fares. The fare increase, which took effect last Monday, came after the Metro Board of Directors voted to increase bus and rail fares by 25 cents last spring. Though the fare bump is a modest increase that can be implemented to further improve Los Angeles public transit and halt its growing deficit, the raise won’t change anything if Metro doesn’t fix its issues of accountability with tactics that include more locked turnstiles.
Irene Wang | Daily Trojan
 
The fare increase, the Metro’s first in nearly four years, will raise one-way bus and rail fares from $1.50 to $1.75. Day passes will increase from $5 to $7, and weekly passes will jump from $20 to $25. Metro monthly passes will be increased from the usual $75 to $100.
Yet, the consequences of not increasing the fare could be worse. The hike came amid pressing financial concerns. By increasing fares by 25 cents, Metro hopes to offset the funding gap and close its $36.8 million operating deficit. According to the Los Angeles Times, if not for the raise, Metro would have had to lay off almost 1,000 of its 9,000 employees or cut one million hours of bus and rail service in 2015.
In addition to the fare increase, Metro has also implemented a new free-transfer policy, by which riders paying with reusable Transit Access Passes, better known as TAP cards, can receive free transfers to other Metro lines for up to two hours.
The original decision, voted on last May, was unsurprisingly met with criticism, particularly from public transit advocates who feared the price bump would negatively affect lower-income riders. According to the Los Angeles Times, Metro has reportedly seen a successful rollout of the higher fares. Yet, it still faces the challenge of making the fare increase worth it — and that means addressing issues of accountability.
Concerns that the price hike will affect frequent riders shouldn’t be taken lightly. Though it is ultimately necessary in balancing Metro’s budget, more should be done on the part of the transportation service to ensure that its raised fare prices have a positive impact.
At present, several stations — particularly those surrounding USC’s University Park campus — use unlocked turnstiles, which essentially allow Metro riders to pass through freely. The unlocked turnstiles rely on an honor system. Metro riders are expected to scan their TAP cards before entering, or they risk being fined up to $250 for fare evasion if caught. Aside from random checks on the Metro, however, there is no real way of ensuring that passengers don’t take advantage of this seemingly unguarded system.
In order for this fare hike to be at all effective, it is imperative that Metro take the steps necessary to ensure more accountability from its customers. Even with the increased fare hike, the Metro fare in Los Angeles is still one of the lowest in the nation — but that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t get taken advantage of. Public transit systems in major cities nationwide such as Chicago and New York City use locked turnstiles to ensure that all riders are abiding by the system. In addition to keeping the system sustainable with this fare hike, Metro must also take measures to make sure that it has a reliable system to really make that extra quarter worth it.
