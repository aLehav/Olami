A USC delegation of deans and trustees led by President C. L. Max Nikias traveled Monday to São Paulo, where USC will open its eighth international office according to USC News.
The delegation includes Dean of the Price School of Public Policy Jack H. Knott, Dean of the Marshall School of Business James G. Ellis, Dean of the School of Cinematic Arts Elizabeth M. Daley and Dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering. Yannis C. Yortsos. The delegation also includes trustees Frank H. Cruz, Edward P. Roski Jr., David H. Dornsife and John Mork.
The new office will work to recruit students from the country, provide programs for prospective students studying in Brazil and facilitate collaborations between the university and Brazilian researchers.
“The University of Southern California community is eager to build even stronger ties with Brazil, and to lay a solid foundation for long-standing, mutually-beneficial collaborations,” Nikias said in a statement. “Brazil will play a particularly vital role in these partnerships, given its strategic location in the Pacific Rim, and USC’s ambition to attract the world’s most talented and creative students.”
The University of São Paulo signed an agreement with the Metropolitan Development Secretary of the State of São Paulo and the Price school, in addition to an agreement to participate in the iPodia Alliance, a Viterbi school international consortium.
USC currently has a partnership with Fundação Getulio Vargas, a private Brazilian university, and participates in the Brazil Scientific Mobility Program, which provides Brazilian students with scholarships to study at USC for one year.
While in Brazil, the delegates will meet numerous members of the Brazilian government, including the chief secretary of São Paulo, the president of the University of São Paulo and the president of the São Paulo Research Foundation. They will also meet with the Secretaries of Economic Development, Metropolitan Development and Science and Technology.
USC also has international offices in Beijing, Hong Kong, Mexico City, Mumbai, Seoul, Shanghai and Taipei.
How many gender neutral restrooms could have been constructed with the Nikias’ all expense paid junket to Brazil.  You should be ashamed!

Campus leaders from 15 different student organizations signed a new statement that was published by Trojans for Israel online Sunday night in support of the United States-Israel relationship.
President of Trojans for Israel Sarah Sax said the leadership statement, published every semester, has shifted its focus from previous semesters.
Though the statement released last fall aimed to denounce the state of Iran’s efforts to obtain a nuclear weapon, the new statement focuses on promoting the importance of the United States’ relationship with Israel. The statement highlighted the similarities between the two nations, specifically their focus on democracy, innovation and social rights.
“The idea was to really show students on campus that this is an issue that people of different backgrounds care about — business leaders, USC leaders and political leaders,” Sax said. “We tried to get a wide variety of people.”
Signatories include College Democrats President Aaron Taxy, College Republicans President Maddy Lansky, 2012-13 USG President Mikey Geragos, 2012-13 USG Vice President Vinnie Prasad, 2013-14 USG President Kurth Park, 2013-14 Undergraduate Student Government Vice President Ryan Park, Black Student Association President Lamar Gary and Interfraternity Council President Ofek Lavian. In total, 22 signatures were collected.
The signatures solely reflected the views of the individuals signing the statement, not the organizations they represent.
For Sax, the statement reflects that the U.S.-Israel relationship is not only of importance to Trojans for Israel, but also to a wide variety of students on campus. It is this same sentiment that Sax said Trojans for Israel tries to convey when lobbying local officials.
“It’s more powerful if students go lobby on an issue as important as the U.S.-Israel relationship,” Sax said. “They don’t get student lobbyists very often and since our group is very knowledgeable about the U.S.-Israel relationship, it not only makes [Trojans for Israel] look good, but also the student body.”
Kudos to the courageous student leaders who signed this petition.  It is shocking to see the reaction by those so filled with hate that they try to stifle the free speech of these leaders and the ability of the Daily Trojan to report on this important campus news.  Keep up the great work!
Trojans for Israel is AIPAC, you numbskulls at the Daily Trojan.
You publish lobbyist directly–how incompetent can you be? You are supposed to vet your sources not act as the propoganda wing for AIPAC.
AIPAC/HILLEL/TFI all the same.
Stunning lack of university oversight.
I wonder what would become of these courageous student leaders if they had rejected
Trojans for Israel’s approach? No pressure there, especially  with the Daily Trojan in Hillels’ pocket. 
President Obama, no friend of Israel, is scheduled to go in a few weeks. I wonder if the article is a coincidence? No doubt, it is not. It is designed to bolster support for Israels policies in the face of American disapproval. Heck, we pay for everything the Israelis do, why should we have a say?
 Not sure who the editor of the DT is but obviously Miss Sax and Miss Serhan have close ties to him/her as they continue to print their stories at will with no interest in the other side.
 I have never seen an anti Israeli word published in the DT. Apparently, Israel can do no wrong. Mr/Ms. Editor, you are not Sal Zell. You do not have the right to propound your own agenda. How the USC Hillel got a hold of the DT is beyond me, but I hereby call for an investigation into the ties between Hillel and the DT. The bias of the DT is so obvious as to be offensive to those who do not support Israel’s policies in the Middle East. The DT is not Heratz. USC is not a satellite of Israel; get out of our paper before you are thrown out.  
Again, we need an investigation into who is approving these articles–the DT has become a farce. As an alumni, I will call Student Affairs to find the discovery process. I am sure, the path is short and direct.
I despise prejudice and that is exactly what is the DT is advocating by ignoring Israeli injustices while sleeping with Hillel. 
I am embarrassed by the DT’s lack of objectivity–no awards this year unless they come from Tel Aviv.
tro9u
I am so proud of these brave 22 student leaders (and future leaders of our communities) who have taken a stand in favor of the US-Israel Alliance. Congratulations to the Daily Trojan for acknowledging this important statement of support. You all have a lot to be proud of!
Signed,
A very proud soon to be Trojan alum
Arafat,
You are the perfect spokesmen for the Trojans for Israel–rabid, amoral, koolaid drinking racist. You are a credit to your beliefs and a discredit to humanity.
Truly Disgraceful soul, showing all that is Israeli. A real mensch and credit to your parents.
Jihad Jane,
You are the perfect apologist for the Muslim Trojans – rabid, amoral, koolaid drinking racist.  You are a credit to your beliefs and a discredit to humanity.
Truly Disgraceful soul, showing all that is Islamic.  A real jihadist and credit to your parents.
Now, wasn’t that a productive effort, really contributing to the discussion at hand?
You’re pathetic Jihad Jane.  In capable of challenging any of the points I have raised.  Only able to attack the messenger due to your inability to discuss these issues as an adult.
Truly pathetic.
Orwellian Apartheid.
There is not one single non-Muslim citizen in Saudi Arabia.
Afghanistan once home to a thriving Buddhist civilization is now 100% Muslim.
Pakistan once home to a thriving and ancient Hindu civilization is soon-to-be devoid of all Hindus.  Meanwhile the Muslim population in India is soaring.
Yemen once home to a large Jewish population now has a dozen, or so, Jews left living there.  The same is true in Iraq and Morocco.
Sudan once home to a large Christian and Animist people has seen most of these people killed or fled or forcibly converted to Islam.
Iran once home to a large, historic Zoroastrian community is helping to ensure these ancient people are ethnically cleans.  The same thing is happening to the Assyrians of Syria, the Chaldeans of Iraq, the Copts of Egypt….
Meanwhile the Muslim demographic in Israel is soaring.
Islamic propaganda, supported by unhinged professors, knee-jerk liberals, politicians who have sold their soul for the petrol dollar and student who don’t have a brain between them all tell us it IS Israel that practices apartheid.
Orwellian apartheid, that is.
There are two UN refugee agencies in the world: First is the United Nations
Relief and Works Administrations (UNRWA) for 5 million Palestinian refugees
(which includes the descendants of the original 500,000 Palestinian refugees
from the Israeli War of Independence) which employs 30,000 workers. The UNRWA
has resettled no Palestinians.
The second refugee agency is the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), which assists every other refugee in the world–including 100
million displaced people during the last 50 years–and employs 7,000 people. The
UNHCR has resettled tens of millions of refugees.
Looking at these numbers, one would think that the cause of the Palestinians
is somehow morally superior to that of all other war refugees. After all, why
have so many more workers been assisting a dramatically smaller group of
people? But if the Palestinians are unique it is only because of their moral
inferiority, as they are the only group of refugees that regularly commit acts
of terrorism against innocent civilians.
Another obvious question: why hasn’t the UNRWA resettled any of the
Palestinian refugees? The answer, of course, is that the surrounding Arab
states would rather have these refugees remain a thorn in Israel’s side, than
help them start a new life. The UNRWA is happy to oblige.
The official media narrative is that these differences are the results of eons of oppression,
checkpoints and blockades. Fair enough. But then why does the IMF put Israel’s
GDP Per Capita well ahead of the oil rich kingdom of Saudi Arabia?
Saudi Arabia has no Israeli checkpoints, no Israeli soldiers or planes flying
overhead. It has wealth literally pouring out of the ground with a fifth of the
world’s petroleum reserves. And yet the IMF puts it 13 places behind Israel and
the World Bank puts it 8 places behind Israel. The only Muslim countries with a
better GDP Per Capita rating than Israel are small monarchies drowning in oil. 
The non-oil Muslim countries who are closest to Israel are Malaysia and
Lebanon, 32 and 33 places behind Israel. Both countries also have sizable
non-Muslim populations. Muslims make up only 50 percent of Lebanon and only 60
percent of Malaysia. 
38 places below Israel is Turkey, which until recently was a secular country
and actually has a statistically significant atheist population. And that’s it.
Below that we fall off a cliff into places like Belarus, South Africa and
Grenada; all of whom still have better GDP Per Capita rates. No Muslim country
without oil has a better GDP Per Capita than a Muslim country that has sizable
Christian or Buddhist minorities.
Palestinians are a miserable and pathetic
people. They slit the throats of innocent Israeli families, then whine when
Israel sets up check points to prevent this. They blow themselves up on crowded
Israeli buses, then whimper when Israel prevents this with a wall. The shoot
rockets at Israel by the thousands, then kvetch and moan when Israel deploys
Iron Dome defenses to prevent this, too.
They forced the construction of the wall. They necessitated the checkpoints. All of
their misery is their own doing. But they will never acknowledge that truth;
because that would mean self-reflection and intelligence (decency and kindness)
on their part– all characteristics they and their leadership know nothing
about.

Lots’ of good Saudi policies to support.  let’s all Support the Alliance.  NOT.
The following are facts, not the Bullsh*t written in these comments.
The only country where Palestinians are given full rights is in Israel.  In Jordan and Lebanon they have some rights, but not to the same extent as they have in Israel, but in every other Muslim country they are denied citizenship and all other rights conferred with it.
Palestinians in Israel have built successful businesses, have become successful lawyers, doctors and professors while they live in squalor, with no hope of bettering themselves in all Muslim countries.
The lies found in the comment section here are reminiscent of what would find in German papers in the 1930s, and like the authors of those blood libels then I doubt the writers of today’s comments feel any shame either.
What sort of person revels in other’s misery other than sadistic pigs and/or people whose ability to be honest, curious and decent have been destroyed?
“Democracy, Social Rights” in Israel? 
Bit of a stretch don’t you think?
My definition of Democracy is Democracy for all and Social Rights for all, not just for Jewish Israelis but even for Arab Israelis.
Great Article. It’s nice to see such wide range support from any university campus.
@Jon, I’m sorry, as much as the media likes to make this seem like a balanced conflict, in reality you cannot equate the claims or actions of both sides.
As a prospective USC parent, I’m concerned about the prevalence of pro-Israel propaganda on this campus. Where is the balance in presenting divergent perspectives that one expects in an institution of higher learning. Gives me pause in having my child attend USC. It’s bad enough that my tax dollars help add to the misery experienced by Palestinians, but to pay tuition that would further Israeli propaganda too? Don’t have the stomach for that.
Let’s not confuse supporting our friendship with Israel with supporting their Middle East policies.  Frankly, they treat their neighbors monstrously, undeniable. They are intent on taking as much from the Palestinians as they can before the world finally says “Enough”, which I hope is soon.
Boy, AIPAC is working overtime these days at USC. Never seen so many articles supporting the Jewish cause.
That’s all right but lets be balanced.
Let’s also support the Palestinians in their cause for statehood, supported by the UN; the exact same method that Israel used to gain statehood.
Let’s see the situation for what it is. It is two sided.
While Saudis repress all their people (other than the royal family whom have private $500 million dollar private airplanes) we focus our angst on Israel for deep down we are really just anti-Semites pretending to be humanitarians.
While Pakistanis ethnically cleanse that once Hindu country of its remaining Hindus we focus our angst on Israel for deep down we are really just anti-Semites pretending to be humanitarians.
While Egyptians ethnically cleanse that country of its ancient Coptic community we focus our angst on Israel for deep down we are anti-Semites masquerading as humanitarians.
While Mali Islamists turn Mali into the next Sudan we focus our angst on Israel for deep down we are really anti-Semites dressed up in humanitarian’s clothes.
While Yemenis turn that bread basket of the Arabian Peninsula into a place of starvation we focus our crocodile tears on Israel for deep down we are really anti-Semites dressed up in fancy humanitarian clothes.
While Islamists in Southern Thailand kill off over 5,000 Buddhists in the span of a few years we ignore their plight and turn our focus on Israel for we are anti-Semites pretending to be concerned humanitarians.
While Hezbollah kills off what remains of the Christian leadership in Lebanon we turn the spotlight on Israel for they are just Jews and we all know nobody has ever defended the Jews. They’re easy pickings and we are really just Brown Shirts pretending to be humanitarians.

Fifty years after Martin Luther King Jr. led the country toward racial and economic equality in the March on Washington, the Black Student Assembly will hold the March on Trousdale today to illuminate the present-day progress that needs to be made.
Cultural outreach · Roland Buck III, a student worker in the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, oversees and completes office tasks Monday afternoon at the center’s front desk. The CBCSA was renamed in 1997 from the Black Student Services Department, which opened in 1977. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Lamar Gary, the executive director of the Black Student Assembly, believes the march will be a meaningful moment for all students on campus.
“The March on Trousdale is supposed to bring to light the March on Washington and what it meant to the community,” Gary said. “We’re focusing on the present and the future.”
The march, which will begin at the Gavin Herbert Plaza and conclude in front of Tommy Trojan, aims to bring awareness to issues concerning the black student population and other cultural centers on campus. The full version of King’s “I Have A Dream” speech will also be played.
The march is part of BSA’s Black History Month initiatives. Black Student Assembly leaders hope it will add to the history of black students on campus by amplifying the voice of those students on campus.
“We’re looking at people in the past to empower us to be the creators of change,” Gary said, “and educate people who have no clue about our history beyond what they were taught in elementary or high school.”
This past month, the BSA held events to build close ties among the black student population. In conjunction with the African-Americans in Health, the organization held a blood drive on Thursday. The BSA also launched a video series of students recalling their most memorable moments related to black history and screened The Central Park Five, a documentary that examined the 1989 case of five black and Latino teenagers who were wrongly convicted of raping a white woman in Central Park. The BSA also held college fairs and programs on the weekends to bring students from the community this month.
These events are fitting considering the black community at the university has a long history of serving the surrounding community and being politically active.
Somerville, the special interest floor for black students that opened in 1995 in Fluor Tower, was named after the first black student who entered the dentistry school in 1903. John Alexander Somerville and his wife Vada were dedicated to serving the black community both professionally and socially. Rev. Thomas Kilgore Jr., a civil rights leader and longtime pastor of the oldest African-American Baptist church in Los Angeles, founded USC’s Black Alumni Association in 1976. Kilgore also helped organize the historic 1963 March on Washington, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Executive Director of the Black Alumni Association Michele Turner attended USC in the late 1970s and early 1980s. During that time, Turner said the black population at the university was 11 percent. For the incoming class of the fall 2012, black students made up just 4.6 percent of the student body.
Turner believes the bond among black students was stronger when she was a student at USC.
“Because of our solidarity, it didn’t take an initiative to bring us together,” Turner said. “That closeness is something that doesn’t go away. My wish truly is for students today to have those relationships and network because it’s an amazing feeling.”
In 1967, the Black Student Union, the predecessor to the Black Student Assembly, was founded. Its stated mission was to expand the realm of possibilities for black students by making USC more accessible.
“The early BSU did what it had to do whether people agreed with it or not,” Turner said. “Black students on campus were fighting racism on a much bigger degree than people remember. Maybe that’s what progress allows — you don’t have to be at a heightened sense because work has been done.”
Turner noted that during the late 1970s, many student organizations were created by and targeted toward black students. For example, AllUsWe was a publication that focused on issues pertinent to black students and campus life.
As Black History Month has evolved over time, the organizations that serve black students on campus have changed as well. In 1997, the Black Student Services Department was renamed the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs. The department focuses on exposing the university and surrounding community to black culture.
CBCSA director Corliss Bennett-McBride expressed optimism about the progress of the cultural centers and organizations that attend to the needs of the current student body.
“Very progressive leaders are taking the BSA to the next level,” Bennett-McBride said. “The students are starting to get back to that progressive nature.”
Bennett-McBride also noted that though their goals and interests change, the spirit of students largely remains unchanged.
“[The March on Trousdale] is appropriate because of the anniversary of the March on Washington,” Bennett-McBride said. “BSA leadership and students within the organization are back to that hunger for doing something and seeking progression. It’s nice to see that because it was kind of lost for a while.”
Jason Sneed, the assistant director of the BSA, said emphasizing mentorship programs with prospective students and educating USC students will benefit the entire student body.
“I personally feel like I’m around the next era of people who will change history,” Sneed said. “We’re focusing on tomorrow because we’re in a completely different time. We’re not fighting for civil rights anymore, but we’re fighting for a level playing field.”
BSA leaders are optimistic about the march. They believe the message is universal and will bring the Black History Month celebration to a meaningful conclusion.
“We want to acknowledge history, but also focus on the present and future, because that’s what we can change,” Gary said. “We hope people make efforts and take the steps to inspire change — that is the whole goal of Black History Month.”

For a team coming off a disappointing 23-32 campaign in 2012 and playing under the leadership of a first-time head coach, one would hope that it could at least rely on a relatively soft schedule in order to boost its players’ confidence.
Unfortunately, this does not appear to be the case for this year’s USC baseball team.
Stepping up · Junior catcher Jake Hernandez (above) has filled in nicely for injured sophomore Garrett Stubbs, hitting .286 to begin the season. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Of the 10 teams the Trojans are scheduled to play over their Pac-12 conference season (Colorado has no team), six are ranked. And that doesn’t even include the likes of perennial power Cal, though the Trojans beat the Golden Bears twice out of three games last season.
USC’s nonconference series includes Fresno State this weekend and Texas Christian in May, two teams that have received votes in the latest NCAA rankings. Needless to say, the Trojans’ schedule is among the toughest in the nation.
Making matters worse is USC’s proximity to top-class local baseball schools. Midweek games are often scheduled based on geography: it’s during the school week, and teams do not want to travel cross-country and miss school.
Many schools that play tough weekend schedules, such as SEC schools, tend to pad their midweek games with relatively easy victories. Take for example No. 3 Vanderbilt, whose midweek slate includes the likes of Evansville, Lipscomb and Buffalo.
Those midweek “cupcakes” are not an option in Southern California, however. On USC’s schedule this year is No. 18 Cal State Fullerton and No. 22 UC Irvine, not to mention the always-strong Long Beach State Dirtbags, who visit Dedeaux Field tonight in their only matchup with the Trojans this year.
Though posting a mediocre 5-3 mark thus far, the Dirtbags’ record is deceptive. Two of those losses came to the aforementioned Vanderbilt Commodores and another against No. 11 Arizona. But Long Beach also came away with a win over each of those teams, and USC coach Dan Hubbs knows his team will not be able to take the Dirtbags lightly.
“It’s going to be a battle,” Hubbs said. “We know that we have to play well to win. We’re young and inexperienced — especially on the mound — but we played well over the weekend and we’ll build from there.”
The Trojans took two out of three from Cal State Northridge this past weekend, a series win that was capped by freshman pitcher Kyle Twomey’s complete-game effort in the rubber match on Sunday. It was a monumentally important start for the Trojans, who had a taxed bullpen after back-to-back extra-innings games on Friday and Saturday.
“It was huge for us because we were very depleted,” Hubbs said of Twomey’s start. “It really allowed us to rest our guys and save them for Tuesday.”
Had Twomey struggled in his start, Hubbs said he would have brought in freshman Brent Wheatley out of the bullpen. With Twomey’s effort, however, Wheatley’s arm was preserved to start tonight’s game.
Wheatley threw five shutout innings against Loyola Marymount last Tuesday and is aiming to lock down that fourth starter role in USC’s midweek contests.
The Trojans suffered a small injury over the weekend as sophomore catcher Garrett Stubbs was forced to sit out all three games with what Hubbs referred to as a “tweak just outside of the knee.” That was no matter, however, as junior designated hitter Jake Hernandez strapped on the gear and caught all 30 innings. Even better, it allowed Hubbs to slot hot-hitting freshman utility man A.J. Ramirez in the designated hitter role. Ramirez went 5-for-12 with three RBIs over the three games.
“To be honest, I was trying to find a way to get him in the lineup,” Hubbs said of Ramirez. “And this just opened up a spot. But when Garrett’s able to go he’ll be back.”
First pitch is scheduled at Dedeaux Field for 6 p.m.
What is the rush to get Stubbs behind the plate with his .154 batting avg. and one rbi? There are 15 pitchers on
the roster so how depleted could the bullpen be in the seventh game of the season. Letting a true freshman
pitcher in his second start ever in college throw 117 pitches could easily have an effect later in the season.

The USC men’s and women’s golf teams had been on a bit of a hot streak of late, and they planned on continuing their strong play this week in their respective out-of-state tournaments.
The men’s team took first place in The Prestige tournament in La Quinta, Calif. last week and the women’s team took second in the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge in Palos Verdes Estates, Calif.  The men’s team began play at the North Ranch Intercollegiate tournament Monday, but the women’s team was unable to take the course at the Allstate Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, La.
The Women of Troy faced a weather delay at English Turn Golf and Country Club on Monday when damaging overnight rain forced play to be suspended. The squad sits just outside the top five in the tournament standings after Sunday’s first round competition. Junior Sophia Popov has led the team so far with an opening round 2-under 70, while freshman Annie Park was right behind her with a 1-under 71.
Popov had an impressive four-birdie performance, finishing the final eight holes at 2-under to tie for seventh and is three strokes behind the leader. Park started off slow, opening at 3-over through nine holes but finished strong in the back nine at 4-under. The freshman is tied for 15th entering today’s play.
Freshman Kyung Kim and junior Rachel Morris are tied for 31st at 1-over 73 while freshman Kim Santiago is tied for 89th at 12-over 84. Host Tulane leads the tournament with a first round 6-under 282. The Green Wave’s No. 1 seed Emily Penttila posted a stellar 5-under 67 to lead the way in the individual standings.
Pac-12 rival UCLA is tied with Duke at second place with 5-under 283, while Alabama and Florida round out the top five. The Trojans, though in 6th place, are only five strokes off the lead with their opening round 287 and just a single stroke from the top five. Play will continue with an 8 a.m. start Tuesday, as the Women of Troy look to rise up the leaderboard in their final 36 holes.
On the men’s side, USC sits well ahead of second-place Pepperdine as the 36-hole first day of competition at the North Ranch Intercollegiate finally draws to a close. The No. 8 Trojans, co-hosts of the two-day tournament with the Waves, were led by the outstanding play of senior Sam Smith. He finished his first round with a 6-under 136, good enough to tie him for the individual round lead.
Smith overcame a rough outing at The Prestige last week to lead a USC team that also was backed by strong performances from freshman Yi Keun Chang and junior Jeffrey Kang, who scored a 4-under 138 and a 3-over 145, respectively.
“After a very rocky start, the team managed to post a couple of good scores,” USC head coach Chris Zambri said.  “Sam [Smith] had a great day and Yi Keun [Chang] hung very tough after a bad start.”
Junior Ramsey Sahyoun and sophomore standout Anthony Paolucci struggled throughout the day after anchoring the team to a share of the title last week. Paolucci scored a 5-over 147 and is currently tied for 23rd. Sahyoun recorded a 9-over 151, though he finished his second round with a 1-over 71, much better than his effort on the first 18 holes.
“We don’t play too many 36-hole days,” Zambri said. “They are very long days but after a sluggish start, it was nice to know we would have a bunch of holes to claw back.”
With only the top four individual scores contributing to the team standings, the Trojans finished round one with an impressive 2-under 564 (285-279) collectively, which was 10 strokes better than second-place Pepperdine (292-282) and BYU (283-291), who are tied at 6-over 574.
The final day of the tournament will begin today, with tee times starting at 7:30 a.m.

In the minutes prior to tipoff between the USC men’s basketball team and UCLA on Sunday afternoon, the Galen Center video board flashed a montage of highlights from the Trojans’ upset win over the Bruins on Jan. 30. It showed flashy dunks and some last-minute free throws, preserving the victory in the minds of fans.
USC players and fans smiled, reminiscing. Meanwhile, UCLA players and fans grimaced, re-living the game.
“That definitely pissed them off,” senior forward Renaldo Woolridge said, when asked about the Bruins’ reaction to the video clips. “It would’ve pissed me off.”
Pissed-off UCLA opened the game by racing out to 7-0 lead in less than three minutes. Its lead grew would only grow from there to 17-4 and then to 21-8. Little changed when the final buzzer rang. UCLA won and did so handily by a final score of 75-59.
For USC, which had been riding a modest four-game winning streak as recently as nine days ago, Sunday’s loss, combined with a similarly disappointing defeat at Cal on Feb. 17 in which it relinquished a 15-point second half lead, functioned as a slap back to reality. This, by all accounts, isn’t playing to rise — contrary to the team’s frequently mentioned slogan.
“We didn’t come ready,” said junior center Omar Oraby, who finished with 11 points. “It comes down to who plays harder, and they played harder.”
The Trojans were simply out of it from the get-go versus the Bruins.
“It was too much of a hole to get out of,” added USC interim coach Bob Cantu, speaking on UCLA’s first-half onslaught.
No doubt, double-digit deficits remain difficult to overcome.
“Obviously it’s a loss, but with the rivalry it’s bigger than a loss,” junior guard J.T. Terrell said.
And so Sunday served as the Trojans’ second-straight loss. Not to mention they’re now 12-15 overall and 7-7 in the Pac-12. The NCAA tournament? That remains every bit of an afterthought barring an unexpected run in the conference tournament to secure an automatic bid. The NIT? That stands increasingly less likely as the Trojans inch further away from the .500 benchmark.
This season — whatever was left of it, anyway — appears to be slipping from their grasp. It isn’t unexpected: Moving on from Kevin O’Neill and a nightmarish final 12 months of his tenure isn’t exactly a quick, overnight fix. Evidently, undoing the damage is going to take a bit of time, perhaps much more than it looked like a couple weeks ago.
No matter how well Cantu, who is now 5-5 since taking over for O’Neill in January, has done at changing the culture around the program and inspiring confidence among players midseason, everything about his scheme looks off. The Trojans still take terrible shots and have little flow offensively; by and large, they live and die by 3-pointers and 17-foot jumpers, which can lead to some nice wins but hardly serves as a recipe for any long-term offensive success.
As for defense, Sunday’s effort couldn’t have been much worse. To open the game, the Bruins made 8 of their first ten shots, a rate that would eventually culminate in a 47.2 percent clip for the game.
The problem currently appears to be that USC can’t find any sort of middle ground for its team. With O’Neill at the helm, they looked like an over-disciplined bunch, robots timid and hesitant to assert themselves on the court, especially on the offensive end. Now, by contrast, they seemingly lack any discipline, are out of position on defense and hoist   ill-advised shots on offense.
Cantu mentioned during his post-game media session that this is a “low” point. There’s nothing new about that: In basketball, as he mentioned, there are plenty of highs and lows. But this group’s problems run deeper than simply a low point. Really, UCLA and Cal have exposed ’SC after a two-week span in which good shooting masked a number of glaring problems: regression on defense and a lack of anything that resembles offensive structure.
This program needs an overhaul. That much is apparent in the wake of a 16-point home loss to a crosstown rival. Does that overhaul still leave Cantu in the big chair on the Galen Center sidelines? Perhaps, sure. But with every loss, it becomes an increasingly unlikely possibility.
Whoever takes over on a full-time basis, whether that’s Cantu or the wide range of candidates who have been publicly linked to the opening in recent weeks, has quite a bit of work cut out for them. What transpired Sunday sure indicates this team is one that’s far, far away from one dancing in March. Despite O’Neill’s departure, USC is still chasing not only UCLA, but most everyone out west.

How can an university with a rich athletic tradition be so inept in basketball for the last almost sixty years
with a handful of exceptions? No matter where the home court was from the North Gym, Pan Pacific Aud,
Sports Arena, and now the Galen Ctr. one disappointment after another. You don’t need a village in a 5
men game to be real competitive on a yearly basis. Look at all the mid-major schools who are in the top
25 rankings and/or make a run in the ncaa tournament each season.

It was a long time coming, but the USC women’s water polo team finally got its rematch against reigning national champion No. 1 Stanford.
Eyes forward · USC head coach Jovan Vavic and the women’s water polo team handed Stanford its first loss of the year in the championship game of the UCI Invitational to extend the Women of Troy’s 12-game winning streak. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
After Sunday’s game, it is fair to say they did not squander their opportunity.
But the path to the much-anticipated rematch was not clear when play began on Sunday. After routing No. 18 Pacific and No. 7 San Diego State on Saturday to begin the festivities at the UCI Invitational, the Women of Troy (12-0) had to get past the semifinal game against crosstown rival No. 3 UCLA.
Led by a scoring attack of freshman driver Anni Espar, sophomore driver Monica Vavic and senior driver Dominique Sardo — who each had a multigoal game — USC was able to set the pace, but the Bruins (16-2) were never far behind.
With two seconds left on the clock in the fourth quarter and the score notched at 10-10, junior     two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist rocketed the go-ahead goal past UCLA goalie Sami Hill. With no time to mount a threatening attack, the Women of Troy triumphed by a final score of 11-10.
With the semifinal win, USC was matched up against rival Stanford in what would prove to be a                                                 star-studded championship game, with two 2012 first-team All-Americans squaring off against one another in USC’s Vavic and Stanford’s sophomore driver Kiley Neushul.
The Women of Troy jumped out to a 4-2 lead at the end of the first quarter, but the Cardinal took the lead in the second quarter, rattling off four unanswered goals to take a 7-5 lead. It wasn’t until the final two minutes of the half that USC began their comeback effort, when junior two-meter Hannah Buckling tacked on two goals to even the score.
It was the third quarter that made the difference in this one, however, as Buckling, Vavic and junior driver Kelly Mendoza scored three consecutive goals to put USC ahead 11-8. The team’s ability to hold strong, despite facing a multigoal deficit to the defending champions, was not lost on USC head coach Jovan Vavic.
“They never quit,” Jovan Vavic said of his players. “We had an excellent third quarter, and that was the turning point of the game for us.”
The Women of Troy would never trail again, holding on for the 13-10 victory in the rematch of last season’s national championship game.
“It was the first time winning a SoCal tournament for a majority of the team, and it was great to have Anni [Espar] out there,” Monica Vavic said. “Those were her first games with us, so to win the tournament with her was huge.”
In addition to the pride gained from defeating four in-state rivals, the Women of Troy gained something else from this tournament victory, something far more important: a greater chance of making the NCAA tournament.
Eight teams make the field at the end of the season, and six of those eight spots are reserved for conference champions. Though winning the conference championship is the preferred method of entering the tournament, locking up at least a wild card spot is the aim of most teams, and Jovan Vavic knows just how important these wins are to his team’s tournament chances.
“Every game is so important,” Jovan Vavic said. “Getting a 1-0 jump on conference rivals is huge if it comes down to head-to-head records.”
The wins against UCLA and Stanford were especially important because USC meets those schools each only once more during the regular season. An early win against both of them only increases their chances of receiving a bid into the NCAA tournament and ensures, at the very, least a split in the teams’ season series.
So far, the Vavic family has had a lot to celebrate in the past six months.  USC’s men’s water polo team, led by national player of the year Nikola Vavic, posted a 29-0 record en route to its unprecedented fifth consecutive national championship. The women’s team has yet to drop a game all season and is led by the aforementioned Monica Vavic, whose 38 goals this season far and away lead the team in scoring.  With one half of the battle already won, the possibility remains for Jovan Vavic to take home both men’s and women’s national championships, something he hasn’t done since the calendar year of 2010.
USC, still yet to play a home game this season, will travel to Berkeley on Saturday, March 2 to take on conference rival No. 4 Cal at 1 p.m.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has long been criticized for its conservative awards and lackluster ceremonies. But this year, the Academy abandoned tradition and opted for a livelier show — one carried largely by host Seth MacFarlane and a series of riveting performances.
With a 15-minute opening that included everything from a sock-puppet re-enactment of Flight to a musical number entitled “We Saw Your Boobs,” MacFarlane immediately warned the audience that this particular edition of the Academy Awards wasn’t going to be traditional. As the co-creator of the hit animated television shows American Dad and Family Guy, MacFarlane was a bit of an unusual choice for the Academy. His sometimes-raunchy comic material has landed him recognition for movies such as Ted and ongoing positions as a roaster on Comedy Central’s annual Roast specials — not the stuff of higher cinematic fare. Needless to say, his popular adult-only material made him a questionable choice for one of Hollywood’s stuffier events.
But MacFarlane didn’t disappoint. He might have dropped a Chris Brown and Rihanna joke in the first 10 minutes of the show — MacFarlane cracked that the brutally violent Django Unchained would be considered a date movie for the pair — but his biting wit and unrivaled sense of humor carried an awards show that was nearly four hours long. It would seem that by choosing MacFarlane as a host, the Academy could be testing out the waters for ceremonies more inclusive of younger audiences in the future.
Still, its choice of MacFarlane as host aside, the Academy had a couple more tricks up its sleeve Sunday evening. Predictably, Daniel Day-Lewis took home the best actor award and Life of Pi claimed the best visual effects category, but when Jennifer Lawrence won best actress for Silver Linings Playbook a surprised — but pleased — gasp swept through the Dolby Theatre.
“I don’t think that we’re going to stop until we get rid of the stigma for mental illness,” said an ecstatic Lawrence in the press interview room as she spoke about the larger themes of Playbook. “If you have to take medication for your mind, there’s such a stigma behind it.”
The first-time Oscar winner was excited, but relaxed, as she fawned over her coveted trophy. Though most of America witnessed her trip on her dress as she climbed the stage to accept her award, a down-to-earth Lawrence played off what could have turned into a nervous breakdown in the hands of a typical Hollywood diva.
“What went through my mind when I fell down?” joked Lawrence. “A bad word that I can’t say that starts with ‘F.’”
Anne Hathaway, another female favorite Sunday night, took home the trophy for best actress in a supporting role for Les Misérables.
“Playing Fantine, having to connect with the darkness of life … the unnecessary suffering that human beings can inflict on each other, I would have loved to have gone home and forgotten about that every day, but you just can’t because it exists,” Hathaway said. “It exists for millions of men and women throughout the world. I think this film changed me because it made me more compassionate and more aware.”
Life of Pi took home four awards Sunday night, one of which was in the category of best director for Ang Lee’s cinematic genius for transforming Yann Martel’s original novel. Though its wins in the best visual effects and best cinematography categories were unsurprising, the film also won for best original score, proving that Life of Pi’s appeal didn’t lie only in its CGI-heavy style.
The Academy adopted a similar mentality for its ceremony. Announcing its first-ever themed show with “music in film,” the Academy put special emphasis on musical achievements within cinema. Barbra Streisand flawlessly performed “The Way We Were.” Catherine Zeta-Jones and Jennifer Hudson added a hint of nostalgia to the ceremony with songs from former Oscar contenders Chicago and Dreamgirls, just before the cast of Les Miserables sealed the musical mash-up with “One Day More.” Adele rocked the house with her performance of “Skyfall” from the Bond film of the same name.
What audiences didn’t know, however, was that her live rendition was only a foreshadowing of the night’s later events: Just a short while later, Adele and co-songwriter Paul Epworth accepted the award for best original song.
“‘Skyfall’ and ‘Rolling in the Deep’ were absolutely done well,” gushed Adele as she cradled her trophy in the press room. “[The best I find is] to be really honest with whoever you’re working with or whoever you’re collaborating with, so that they get the idea.”
Later on in the evening, Quentin Tarantino accepted the award for best original screenplay for his film Django, which also won Christoph Waltz the title of best supporting actor. But even with these pleasant surprises dotting the ceremony, perhaps the biggest surprise came during the best picture reveal: First Lady Michelle Obama presented the award to Ben Affleck, George Clooney and Grant Heslov for Argo.
“I was sort of hallucinating when that was happening,” said a shell-shocked Affleck regarding Obama’s presentation. “[When you’re hallucinating, it] doesn’t seem that odd. … It’s natural because the whole thing is so unnatural. … The whole thing kind of alarmed me at the time, but in retrospect, the fact that it was the first lady was an enormous honor.”
Affleck’s win for Argo came as a well-deserved end to a ceremony that had given Argo awards in the best editing and adapted screenplay categories earlier. Snubbed by the Academy when he didn’t receive a nomination for best director, Affleck proved that he was more than capable of holding his own against the likes of Steven Spielberg and David O. Russell.
“I stood out here in front of you all, really just a kid,” said Affleck as he humbly accepted the award. “I went out and I never thought I would be back here. And I am, because of so many of you who are here tonight, because of this Academy, because of so many wonderful people who extended themselves to me when they had nothing to benefit from it in Hollywood.”
Though the 85th annual Academy Awards certainly held some disappointments — Beasts of the Southern Wild didn’t take home any awards and the production design for The Hobbit lost out to Lincoln — the ceremony proved engaging, even despite its extended run time. In what was perhaps one of its better recent ceremonies, the Academy successfully defied expectations while delivering a show that appealed to all audiences, ultimately reminding viewers of why it’s held a title as one of the most important nights in Hollywood for 85 years.
The article forgot to mention the the winner for best adapted screenplay, Chris Terrio, is a USC alumni, with a masters degrees from the School of Cinematic Arts.

Apparently, the Super Bowl is a big deal. Now, I do the parties, the cheering and eating and screaming, but, honestly, the outcome of the Super Bowl has no effect on my life whatsoever.
And apparently, the NBA’s Finals are also a big deal. Again, I’m a good sport — but a good sport who doesn’t lose sleep over the results of Game 10 or whatever it is.
The Academy Awards, on the other hand — now that’s the equivalent of the Super Bowl for me. When presenters are on stage, I bite my nails, I scream and shout, and I close my eyes because I can’t watch what happens next.
And if the Oscars are my Super Bowl, then the red carpet preshow is my version of the very best pregame possible.
Oscar fashion is in a class in and of itself. I remember the Golden Globes a couple of years ago: Lea Michele, one of the most fashionable and gorgeous gals in Hollywood right now, rocked a black Oscar de la Renta with a train to die for. Yes, she looked gorgeous, but all anyone could really say was, “Homegirl, this isn’t the Oscars — stop trying to add the drama.”
The Oscars are the big leagues: It’s where you pull out the big guns. If you’re nominated, it’s the night that you could walk away with one of the biggest honors on the planet, and what you wear while accepting is often even more important than the award itself. Sure, Gwyneth Paltrow won the best actress award in 1999 for Shakespeare in Love, but all anyone could think about was that too-loose pink Ralph Lauren confection (and her too-tight ballerina bun.)
So, the pressure was on at this year’s ceremony. In the age of social media and celebrity obsession, a star could think that she was rocking her black gown but end up as the laughingstock of the Twitterverse (RIP Angelina Jolie’s right leg).
Thankfully, nominees and guests alike turned up the glamour and brought the golden age of Hollywood style back to life.
The theme of the night was simple with a funky twist. Best actress winner — and new face of Dior — Jennifer Lawrence (who I will now only refer to as J. Law, just because it’s awesome) rocked a mermaid/ballgown-ish off-white confection from Dior Haute Couture. Stunning is probably the understatement of the year. J. Law’s dress made up for some misses earlier in her awards season run, and with a simple necklace draped down her back instead of the front, J. Law proved that there’s always beauty in the unexpected.
Jessica Chastain, a best actress nominee, decided that bombshell was the way to go. Dressed in a slinky Armani Privé gown, the color perfectly complimented her porcelain skin. Another best actress nominee, Quvenzhané Wallis, looked adorably age-appropriate in a blue satin dress and sash and the cutest puppy purse anyone has ever seen.
Though she wasn’t a nominee, Charlize Theron decided that she wasn’t about to miss out on the show. The previous winner looked like the coolest, most badass angel there ever was in a Dior Haute Couture column dress with architectural cutouts and a perfectly coiffed pixie cut.
Other stars such as Kerry Washington, Reese Witherspoon and Amy Adams, also rocked their frocks, but let’s be real — it’s hard to show up a puppy purse and a nine-year-old nominee who flexes her muscles whenever the camera is on her.
Unfortunately, not everyone could follow J. Law’s lead. Though she used to kill it on the red carpet, best supporting actress winner Anne Hathaway made me gasp for air — in a bad way — with her ill-fitting white Prada number and tacky necklace. Anne reportedly told Ryan Seacrest that she found her dress mere hours before the ceremony — and it shows. Next time you win an Oscar, Anne, please dress like the winner you are.
Salma Hayek decided to attend the awards ceremony as her alter ego, the Queen of the Medieval Goth Vampires. Salma is known for being a bombshell, but apparently she decided that a tiara and bondage-like neckline was more appropriate for the evening.
And Kristen Stewart — well, what can I say about Kristen Stewart? Sometimes she nails it, but most of the time she looks like she wants to throw up. If you’re so uncomfortable at these things, then stay home. It’s not enjoyable for us viewers to watch you parade around in poorly fitted clothes and unkempt hair.
Yes, there were some weak points, but all in all, the red carpet at this year’s Oscars was one that dropped jaws. For every Hathaway, there was a Chastain to pick up the pieces. Here’s hoping that next year’s batch of stars will remember that this isn’t an ordinary night: You’ve got to step up your game.

Those perusing The Buttercup LA’s Yelp page might think that the hyperbolic comments, which range from “OMG! These are the BEST macarons I’ve EVER HAD in my ENTIRE life!!!!” to “They are so good I can’t explain it,” are the product of overly excited teenage girls.
Sweet tooth · Mim Lundgren’s passion for macarons began three years ago; the sweet cookies first reminded her of Swedish Christmas candy. — Courtesy of Henry Chea
But those who have had the pleasure of tasting The Buttercup LA’s macarons will confirm that these comments are actually not exaggerations — the store’s macarons really are that good.
Though world-famous cafes in Europe have sold macarons for years (such as Gerbaud in Budapest and the O.G. of macaron perfection: Ladurée in Paris), macaron mania has only taken Los Angeles recently.
For those who have yet to experience the delight that comes with eating one of these delicate, colorful treats, a macaron (sometimes incorrectly spelled “macaroon,” though macarons are nothing like those cakey cookies) is a small French cookie composed of a dollop of ganache sandwiched between two almond meringues, infused with flavors ranging from plain chocolate or vanilla to exotic options such as rose or passion fruit.
The Buttercup LA is one of the hottest new “it” macaroon shops. Located beside a Pinkberry and a slew of other dessert shops on Olympic Boulevard, The Buttercup LA is presided over by Mim Lundgren.
Lundgren, who recently emigrated from Sweden, possesses an almost ethereal beauty, the kind usually reserved for Hans Christian Andersen’s story or the cast of Game of Thrones. Fittingly, The Buttercup LA macarons taste like something almost out of a fairytale.
“I basically am a macaron-aholic. I love macarons. I always said if I was going to open my own place, it had to be, like, surrounded by desserts,” Lundgren said. “So yeah, it had to be macarons.”
Lundgren’s passion for macarons was born three years ago when she tasted her first macaron.
“I think the reason that it kind of clicked with me is that it reminded me of a Swedish Christmas candy we make every year,” Lundgren said. “All of a sudden, I went from thinking that macarons were kind of overhyped and overpriced to thinking, ‘They were ever so justified.’ I don’t think I’ve gone a week without eating a macaron since.”
The Buttercup LA makes it easy for anyone who shares Lundgren’s love to indulge in their favorite sweet. Organized into pre-sorted boxes of two, six, 12 or 24 (sorry, folks, no mixing and matching), each flavor, it seems, is more enticing than the last.
For fruit lovers, there’s a box with coconut, lemon, orange blossom, passion fruit and raspberry. The best-selling package, however, features two of the Earl Grey tea, the pistachio and the sea-salt caramel varieties. This way, patrons have the option of sharing them with their friends to spread the gospel of macarons — the petite, pastel boxes make beautiful gifts. Or, if you’re feeling self-indulgent, why not treat yourself?
The only drawback when it comes to The Buttercup LA is that it is expensive — The store sells macarons at $2 apiece. Still, though it might seem that paying more than 50 cents for something essentially the size of an Oreo is not much bang for the buck, macarons are far more filling than they appear to be. In fact, eating more than two or three of them might actually be an unpleasant sugar overload.
Why choose the macarons at The Buttercup LA over those from ultra-cool Bottega Louie or ’lette? Because the macarons are just all-around superior. They are substantial without being heavy, they’re thick without being too chewy and their flavor is strong but not overwhelming. Also, Lundgren could not make the store a more welcoming place.
Lundgren’s last bit of advice for macaron lovers?
“Never settle for anything less than perfection.”
And those who check out The Buttercup LA will never have to.

Johan Bender is living proof that one class can take someone a long way.
Park it · Johan Bender, who graduated from the Copenhagen Business School in 2012, spent a fall semester at USC, where he helped establish the FreeBike Project. The business leases free bikes to students on campus. — Courtesy of Johan Bender
Bender, who graduated from the Copenhagen Business School in 2012, spent a fall semester at USC, where he and co-founder of FreeBike Project, Kim Sanderhoff, took an entrepreneurship course and developed their idea for the business.
FreeBike Project, just like how it sounds, leases free bikes to college students while integrating innovative marketing strategies. Bender said he and Sanderhoff were inspired by the lack of marketing on campus.
“We noticed that there are not a lot of billboards on campus so it’s hard to reach out to students,” Bender said. “We thought we could use bicycles as a way of communicating with students.”
And FreeBike Project does just that. Each bike, out of the 88 currently out and about, has a special advertisement plastered on it, with sponsors including restaurants such as Jacks ‘N Joe and Margarita Pizza Bar and startups like mySocialCloud.com.
Moreover, the company has a philanthropy component. Each semester, after leasing a free, branded bike, FreeBike Project then donates an equal number of bikes overseas to underprivileged children.
Bender said most startup companies do not start with anything charitable because it’s not smart from an investment perspective and the companies usually want to see their money grow, but they decided to do it because they knew they had a chance to make a difference.
“Even though it sets us back on how fast we can grow, we thought the value of doing something greater than just marketing outweighed the extra capital that could drive us forward,” Bender said.
Marc Fernandez, an instructor at the Institute for Multimedia Literacy, said Bender is a great role model to students in his Digital Media for Business class. Fernandez admires many aspects of FreeBike Project, but one attribute that impresses him the most is that Bender and Sanderhoff have managed to combine an entrepreneurial vision with strong social ethics.
“I think it’s really tough to do in a way that comes across as legitimate and credible. A lot of people tack on ‘we’re going to give ten percent of our profits to wherever,’ as a marketing tool,” Fernandez said. “But what they’ve managed to do is incorporate [the service aspect] into the business and make it seem genuine.”
As a teacher, Fernandez is not outrageously surprised by the success of Bender’s business. “I think the purpose and the goal for these classes is to take people that are entrepreneurial already and give them the skills they need to actually realize their vision,” he said.
Fernandez said that Bender is a great example of what students can do when given the chance through their coursework.
“One of the things that I really like is that it shows that even when you’re a student you can start working on your entrepreneurial vision and you can make stuff happen,” Fernandez said.
For Bender and Sanderhoff, home is a long way away — and when their classes ended, the two had to find a way to stay in the States. They found a way to get new visas and completed their Copenhagen Business School studies online.
“I thought we might have an opportunity to do something for real, instead of doing everything in class as projects,” Bender said.
And so with an idea, a philanthropic element and innovative marketing plans, FreeBike Project was born.
“We started working on it step-by-step, building our prototype, creating our website and making a lot of mistakes along the way,” Bender said.
The hardest part in the beginning, according to Bender, was attracting the first client. “Before you have your first client nobody believes in you and people just assume you’re not good enough,” he said.
But after gaining a few clients, things got a lot easier. “As soon as you can say you have someone else believing in you, it makes it a lot easier,” Bender added.
FreeBike Project has worked on ways to increase marketing strategies, improve digital media use and expand its name through various social media campaigns and giveaways.
According to Fernandez, FreeBike Project’s intensive media use, “embodies a lot of the things we try to teach which is initiative, using the tools of digital media and making stuff happen.”
Lindsey Caldwell, a senior majoring in theatre and business, is one of the 88 FreeBike participants riding through campus. Caldwell initially participated because she admired the community service aspect. Adopting a similar one-for-one model like the famous Toms  shoes brand, FreeBike Project aids in donating bikes to the Philippines, and Caldwell was impressed with this philanthropic business model.
“USC is such an awesome place where a lot of people have amazing, incredible and really talented ideas. But 90 percent of the time they never get implemented and people never try,” Caldwell said. “It shows a lot of maturity and that they have ownership in their company.”
In the end, every participant working with FreeBike Project helps to bring the duo of Bender and Sanderhoff closer to their vision.
“Our goal is to develop a green and innovative marketing platform that benefits students, businesses and charities,” Bender said.
Bender said that he likes how all of the different pieces fit together in the FreeBike Project.
“It’s not a zero sum game. Companies, sponsors, students and charities can benefit and nobody stands out as a loser,” he said.
But FreeBike Project is not ready to stop at USC. In the future, they hope to be at all bike-friendly campuses in the United States and to connect with those students and sponsors from all over.
“The thing I enjoy the most is connecting with people, whether it’s students or startups,” Bender said. “We have the ability to provide them with something special.”

John Kerry, the newly confirmed U.S. Secretary of State, will have quite a few challenges before him as he steps into office. Between North Korean nuclear tests, continued anti-Semitic and anti-Western rhetoric from Iran, the Eurozone spiraling into collapse and the last remnants of old revolutions and the brewing of new ones in the Middle East, there is hardly time for Kerry to catch his breath and become acquainted with the job.
Consequently, Kerry must encourage fragile and failing states to adapt to democracy, a policy former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton advocated in her time in office. By providing key stability now, the United States can move transitioning states toward stable democracies.
In the current climate of political upheaval, various Arab nations are experiencing increased public discord during a period of governmental transition. Libya, Bahrain, Tunisia, Egypt and Yemen have all experienced some sort of governmental change. During this process of new leadership, these states are at their most vulnerable and most chaotic.
Anarchy tends to breed autocracy. As Ian Bremmer writes in The J Curve, anarchy is the lowest point of stability for a country. From anarchy, countries either move toward democracy, which is more stable in the long run but requires a longer process to achieve relative stability, or autocracy, which provides more immediate results but is less stable and less open in the long run.
In keeping with U.S. interests, Kerry should push countries experiencing governmental change toward democracy while assisting in alleviating some of the pressures of the temporary anarchy.
Kerry also needs to step up in his role as the lead diplomat for the most powerful country in the world. Kerry already has a long record as a successful peace activist. Following his brave service for this country during the Vietnam War and as an elected senator for the state of Massachusetts, Kerry has consistently advocated using peaceful means wherever possible to change the political climate around the world. Kerry also chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, giving him valuable experience in world diplomacy.
Kerry would be correct to help other nations in this regard. In these instances, newly formed governments are unable to act with the haste necessary to protect their citizens from the pressures of anarchy and political upheaval. During these periods, the would-be leaders are often not in sufficient control of their own countries, mandating U.S. action to help stop discord by providing some of the basic needs for law and order, border protection and the possibility for economic development and growth.
Kerry has already shown that he is willing to turn to the United Nations for assistance. Before the first Gulf War, Kerry often argued that the international sanctions placed upon Saddam Hussein and supported by the U.N. should be given time to work before the U.S. stepped in with full-scale military intervention.
Kerry realizes the value of international cooperation, especially with the U.N. Cooperation will help legitimize the actions of the United States, which is especially necessary coming off two bloody and unilateral engagements. The United States, consequently, has had to rethink counter-terrorism strategies to preserve the lives of civilians while simultaneously reducing the threat of terrorism to the U.S. and the international community.
If the U.S. government were to assist in this matter, it would also help limit the spread of terrorism. As former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated in an article entitled “Helping Others Defend Themselves” published in the journal Foreign Affairs in 2010, the threat of terrorism now comes mostly from unstable states.
After recent government changes, states such as Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia and Libya after recent governmental changes fit Gates’ definition. The United States, as a leader in the global War on Terror, should make sure that the elimination of terrorism is a central part of our foreign policy mission.
With the War in Afghanistan winding down, the United States would do best to turn its attentions to stopping terrorism in fragile states with transitioning governments.
Kerry consistently advocated world cooperation during his time in elected office. His appointment by President Barack Obama as Secretary of State gives Kerry ample opportunity to exercise the power of the United States in stopping terrorism and advancing its policy goals.
In his first year in office, Kerry needs to help create stability and democracy in troubled regions. Without peace and stability, there is little room to focus on the human interests that are otherwise lacking in troubled regions.

Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo, sent out a memo Friday saying that all Yahoo employees are now required to physically come in to Yahoo headquarters each and every day for work. If employees were unable or unwilling to do so, Mayer said, they could look for employment elsewhere.
Amy Hsieh | Daily Trojan
The decision was sparked, in part, to increase productivity. “Speed and quality are often sacrificed when we work from home,” the memo said. “We need to be one Yahoo and that starts with physically being together.”
Though Mayer’s view might seem outdated to the millennial, stay-at-home generation, and might even seem downright harsh to Yahoo employees working from remote locations, the decision is ultimately a good one. Instituting a mandatory attendance policy can help cut down on wasted time, inefficient workdays and superfluous employee salaries. Mayer’s decision is a necessary one — one that required courage to make.
The decision to mandate employee attendance has been understandably controversial. Employees who previously had agreements to work from home are now required to drastically change their lifestyles and work habits. Many employees do not live close to Yahoo headquarters and, as a result, have to suffer through lengthy commutes or seek new living situations. Many Yahoo employees are unhappy with the decision and even critics have expressed doubt about whether such a move has any positive effect on productivity.
“Putting employees back into a box is not good for Yahoo,” Huffington Post columnist Lisa Belkin wrote. “It is not good for workers. And it is very bad business.”
Despite the fact that employees might be uncomfortable with the decision, Mayer’s plan is actually extremely strategic. Yahoo as a company has lately seen dwindling stock prices and has gone through four CEOs in the past five years; at only $20.73, its market share of 13.4 percent trails behind Google’s $790.77 and experts agree that the company is struggling.
Many cite Yahoo’s bloated infrastructure as a cause for concern, and Mayer is the first CEO to take the problem head on. “The bottom line is that the situation at Yahoo is a mess,” Macquarie Securities analyst Ben Schachter said before Mayer took office.
Mayer and her vision for a corporate makeover could be exactly what the Yahoo! needs. A former Google employee and Stanford graduate, Mayer has caused quite a media frenzy since the beginning of her reign as CEO of Yahoo. in July 2012, at 37-years-old, she is the youngest female CEO to ever lead a Fortune 500 company and the only one to accept the role while six months pregnant.
Yet Mayer’s pregnancy did little to slow her ambitions at Yahoo. Within her first few months at the company, she spearheaded the designing of a brand new Yahoo homepage and made significant mobile acquisitions to help increase Yahoo’s reach as a global market. Using her experience at Google as a benchmark, Mayer has worked to build a healthy company culture at Yahoo and, in her own words, “make the world’s daily habits inspiring and entertaining.”
Brand-building aside, requiring employees to come in to work every day has financial logic. Like companies such as Google and Facebook, Yahoo prioritizes employee satisfaction and provides perks including free food, free gadgets and relaxation time, but allowing employees to work from home is uncommon at any of the other big technology companies. In addition, mandating employee attendance cuts down on inefficient use of resources and emphasizes employee productivity.
Mayer’s decision might have indirect benefits as well. By implementing a hard-and-fast rule, Mayer could be anticipating that some Yahoo employees will be unable to accommodate the change and decide to quit, which might help the company in the long run by cutting down on salary costs while retaining those in line with Mayer’s vision.
Ultimately, the decision to require all Yahoo employees to come to work every day is a wise one. Forbes journalist Greg Satell wrote, “Mayer made a tough call … The role of a CEO is not to try to please everyone, but to lead. That means making decisions that people aren’t going to like, dealing with the consequences and moving forward.”
If nothing else, Mayer has shown that she is capable of making tough decisions, decisions that might help her employees in the long run building a solid company.
By making such a controversial decision so early in her reign as CEO, Mayer has proven that she is one to watch.

PRODUCTIVITY PRODUCTIVITY PROFITS!!!!!!!!!
Let’s ignore the culture and well-being of our employees and copy what I experienced at Google. Never mind that we are Yahoo!
Out of touch policy-making based on terribly conservative business rhetoric.
And you, Tommy, are a great example of the entitled, spoiled brat of a generation that has just reached “adulthood.” You should be grateful to have any sort of employment, let alone benefits, bonuses and time off. This is why so many recent graduates can’t find employment – a horrible attitude that they feel entitled to a superior job right out of the chute because they are holding a college degree. Sorry, Charlie. Its about time folks like you GREW UP
Yes, take shots at me and miss the whole point.
I was talking about the plight of CURRENT employees, as in the ones who built Yahoo!. I didn’t say a word about new hires.
Yahoo! is an internet company, their offices are the internet, not a room.
Their situation is a mess right now. Frankly, a company like Yahoo! can’t afford to have employees who don’t show up to work every day and not have their productivity ensured in person. Yeah, great for Google or Facebook with their more lenient policies; they can afford to give employees leeway right now but Yahoo! can’t afford to. Hopefully its employees will realize this and strike to work extra hard and productively until the company recovers.

The USC women’s tennis team fought valiantly in Berkeley this weekend, but could not stave off No. 7 Cal in their 5-2 defeat.
USC came out strong in the match taking the doubles’ point from the Golden Bears with ease.
”It was a tough loss and the toughest losses for me are the matches that are winnable at some time during the match,” USC coach Richard Gallien said. “The positive would be that Cal is a really tough team and we almost beat them without two out of our top three players, while UCLA with their full team was two points away from defeat the day before.”
The nation’s top doubles team of junior Kaitlyn Christian and sophomore Sabrina Santamaria took down the Cal pairing of Lynn Chi and Anett Schutting, who rank 27th nationally, by a 8-5 margin. Overshadowing the match, though, was an injury to Santamaria that kept her out of the singles portion of the match.
Cal’s top player, Zsofi Susanyi, also missed her singles’ match after injuring herself in the team’s previous match against UCLA just a day prior. The two injuries deprived the crowd of a match between the top singles players in the country as Susanyi and Santamaria share the crown of being ranked No. 1.
Sophomore Zoë Scandalis also missed the match due to injury, and USC will look to get her back as soon as possible.
“Sabrina coming out for us really hurt, especially because she’s playing the best tennis of anyone in the country, but you can’t cry over spilled milk you just have to be ready for the next time you get out,” Gallien said. “It looks like a sprained ankle for Sabrina, and Zoë is almost done healing with what could’ve possibly been a stress fracture, but it looked like they got it early enough.”
On court two, seniors Danielle Lao and Valeria Pulido played a tough match against Fabikova and Susanyi that ended up in a 8-6 victory.
Sophomores Gabriella DeSimone and sophomore Giuliana Olmos handily defeated Davis and Posylkin 8-2 in the third slot to wrap up the doubles round.
Chi, who’s ranked No. 66, scored Cal’s first point of the match after defeating Olmos, who broke into the nation’s top 100 this week and now sits at No. 81. Olmos, who usually plays in the third slot, had to be shuffled around because of the injury and she went down quietly 4-6, 0-6.
Ranked No. 3 in the country, Lao could not stave off a gritty performance from Schutting, who ranks No. 30 in the country, at the top of singles. Filling in for Susanyi, Schutting defeated Lao, who also was replacing Santamaria on court one, 6-2, 2-6, 6-3.
After Alice Duranteau came back to defeat Pulido on court six, 2-6, 6-3, 6-0, USC received a much-needed victory from freshman Ellie Yates. Starting in the fifth spot, Yates took down Kelly Chui of Cal 6-3, 7-5 to knot the match at 2-2.
Now ranked 60th in the nation, DeSimone gave it all she had on court three against Cal’s Klara Fabikova, but it wasn’t enough to stave off defeat. After losing the first set 6-2, DeSimone came back strong to win the next set 6-3, but could not push through in the third and would fall 7-5.
Christian was also engaged in a three-set match and, just like DeSimone, she fought hard but could not come out on top. After winning the first set 7-5, Christian dropped the next two sets 7-5, 6-1 as Cal’s Tayler Davis would seal the deal for the Golden Bears.
“It would be really discouraging for us if we had our full team, but we need to get healthy over the next 10 days or so, “  Gallien said. “We can definitely play with anybody, but the losses do sting, and we just have to go on and compete again.”
The Women of Troy will look to bounce back after dropping to 8-2 on the year in their next match against San Diego on March 1.

The USC men’s tennis team suffered its second defeat of the season Friday in a thrilling match against visiting rival UCLA. Friday was the second matchup in five days between the two teams, who met the previous Sunday in the semifinal round of the Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s team indoor championships. The Trojans won their match last Sunday, but the Bruins evened the season series at one apiece with a close win on Friday.
There was plenty of excitement surrounding the match, the rivalry between the schools notwithstanding; USC and UCLA are ranked No. 2 and No. 3 in the nation, respectively, and both schools have renowned tennis programs. The atmosphere at Marks Stadium carried a fervent intensity from the beginning, as evidenced by the large multitudes of spectators from both schools cheering on their respective squads. Many supporters stood in the walkways and stairs at one point, as the seats were filled to capacity.
The drama of the matches didn’t disappoint, as things got contentious right from the start with the doubles point. With the teams tied 1-1, junior Emilio Gomez and sophomore Eric Johnson fought back from being down 4-1 in their set to force a tiebreak at 8-8. After a hard-fought set, Gomez and Johnson would eventually concede the tiebreak, and subsequently the doubles point, to the UCLA tandem of senior Alex Brigham and sophomore Dennis Mkrtchian.
Most of Friday’s singles play served as a continuation from Sunday’s matches; UCLA rolled out a slightly different order from their meeting on Sunday and pitted Mkrtchian against USC freshman Max de Vroome and junior Clay Thompson against sophomore Yannick Hanfmann, to mixed results. Hanfmann started slow out of the gate and dropped the first set but came back to dominate Thompson 3-6, 6-2, 6-0.
Such success was not the case for de Vroome, who began his match by cruising to a 6-2 first set but faltered in the second and third set en route to his second defeat at the No. 5 position this season, 6-2, 4-6, 4-6. The true freshman, who relied on his screaming forehand winners and powerful serves to overwhelm his opponent, employed sound tactics in the first set forcing Mkrtchian to his backhand and kept the Bruin sophomore on his heels. Midway through the second set, however, unforced errors from de Vroome allowed Mkrtchian back into the match.
“I gave him [Mkrtchian] a chance to get in the match and he is good enough to understand when he has to step up, so he did that very well,” de Vroome said. “He began to hit the balls more with his backhand and, unfortunately, it took me too long to get back in my own game. I don’t think he changed a whole lot, [though] I made it difficult for myself.”
De Vroome’s teammate and captain junior Ray Sarmiento fared better, securing his rematch against UCLA sophomore Dennis Novikov in a workmanlike straight-sets victory, 6-4, 6-3. Sarmiento neutralized Novikov’s powerful forehands and high-velocity serves with expertly employed slice shots and some dazzling, ankle-breaking footwork. Sarmiento’s court-coverage allowed him to take control of points as he punished the less-mobile Novikov and forced the Bruin to his backhand.
“It wasn’t the greatest tennis, but you have to find ways to win,” Sarmiento said. “[Novikov] likes pace, so the strategy against him is to mix it up a lot and utilize all my shots. The slice worked well, and I looked to get him moving.”
In their previous meeting at the ITA Indoor Championships, USC defeated UCLA by a hair’s breadth, clinching the final deciding match in a tiebreak. For the first three and a half hours on Friday, it appeared that history would repeat itself as USC saw itself tied 3-3 with only the match at the No. 2 position between junior Emilio Gomez and Bruin sophomore Marcos Giron remaining.
Gomez began the match strong, clinching the first set, 6-4. He looked to be en route to a well-fought victory up 4-3 in the second set, when Giron called an out for a Gomez lob at a crucial point in the game. The controversial call was missed by the line judge and the momentum seemed to shift in Giron’s favor thereupon. Giron mixed up his approach, employing deep ground strokes and surgically precise drop shots, which ultimately wore Gomez down in the final set as he clinched the victory and the overall match, 4-6, 7-5, 7-6(3). Gomez and Giron have played twice this season and now split their matches at one apiece.
USC coach Peter Smith expressed displeasure with his team’s overall performance.
“Bad execution out there, bad tactics. In the end, [UCLA] seized the opportunity and we didn’t,” Smith said. “We have to be experienced enough to take the momentum. Things happen, mistakes are made, calls are made. You have to just keep going [but] we didn’t do a very good job.”
Coming mere moments after suffering such a tough loss to crosstown rivals, Smith, echoing the sentiments of his team, put it best.
“That’s life. You have to learn from it and get better, and we certainly have a lot to learn.”
