Crimes against property
at 8:02 p.m. on April 8, the RadioShack store manager reported that a suspect had entered RadioShack and attempted to return an iPod cable for a refund using a receipt for a different item. The manager denied the refund, and a subsequent review of video footage revealed that the suspect had stolen the cable on a previous occasion.
Miscellaneous incidents

A study presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research this week found that increased coffee consumption may reduce the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common type of liver cancer.
The study was funded by the National Cancer Institute and compared those who consumed fewer than six cups of coffee per week, those who drank one to three cups per day and those who drank four or more cups per day. It found that those who drank one to three cups per day had a 29 percent reduction in risk for developing HCC, and those who drank four or more cups per day had a 42 percent reduction in risk for developing HCC.
The results were consistent regardless of the participants’ ethnicity, sex, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol intake or whether or not they had diabetes.
“Coffee intake has been suggested to lower the risk for HCC in epidemiologic studies, but these studies were conducted outside of the United States,” said V. Wendy Setiawan, assistant professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine at the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center in Los Angeles. “We wanted to examine whether coffee consumption is associated with risk for developing HCC in multiethnic U.S. populations.”
The study analyzed nearly 180,000 male and female participants, including those of Caucasian, African American and Latino descent. The researchers tracked the participants’ coffee consumption and other lifestyle and dietary factors for up to 18 years. At the end of the study, 498 of those involved contracted HCC.
Setiawan noted that this study allows coffee to be added as a medical ailment for the treatment of HCC.
“Data from a diverse group of men and women from various ethnicities followed up for 18 years showed a statistically significant dose-response relationship between increasing coffee consumption and lowered HCC risk,” Setiawan said. “Now we can add HCC to the list of medical ailments, such as Parkinson’s disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke, that may be prevented by coffee intake. Daily coffee consumption should be encouraged in individuals who are at high risk for HCC.”

From April 2-5, the USC Thornton School of Music, as well as representatives from leading music institutions, met in Sydney, Australia for the inaugural Asia-Pacific Music Summit.
Music to my ears · The USC Thornton School of Music attended the first ever Asia-Pacific Music Summit, held from April 2-5 in Sydney, Australia. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
The two institutions representing the United States were the Thornton School of Music and the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. The goal of the summit was to create closer ties between musical institutions in the Pacific Region, as well as advance the area as a driving force of music education and culture.
“I could not be more pleased to be able to spend quality time with these Pacific Rim music leaders,” said Robert Cutietta, dean of the Thornton School. “Our discussions about the future of classical music, and music in general, have been very stimulating.”
The Sydney Conservatorium of Music at the University of Sydney and Beijing Central Conservatory of Music hosted the summit. Over the course of four days, leaders discussed course programs, student exchanges, industry collaborations, funding models and performance platforms.
The inaugural conference served as the first time that deans and presidents gathered from the schools participating in the conference in the Pacific Rim region.
Sydney Conservatorium of Music Dean Karl Kramer described the conference as a “unique” opportunity to utilize the distinctive traits of multiple premier music institutions.
“While we all assume the Western music tradition of teaching, each institution is mutually exclusive in terms of how it operates,” Kramer said. “We are 12 unique case studies, each with different expertise to share. The summit is a starting point to forming stronger human connections between the institutions to encourage greater and more regular dialogue across the region.”
A result of the conference was the establishing of the Pacific Alliance of Music Schools by representatives in attendance. The newly formed PAMS consists of pre-eminent music institutions from Australia, China, Japan, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan and the United States. During the summit, the participants also solidified their commitment to an annual convention hosted by a member of PAMS.
“This inaugural conference is an outstanding beginning to an important alliance of the finest music schools on the Pacific Rim,” said David H. Stull, president of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. “Global interchange is the future of music and education. I am tremendously enthusiastic about the potential of this initiative.”

Comcast and the USC Shoah Foundation have announced a five-year partnership to annually televise the series Days of Remembrance: PastFORWARD for Comcast Xfinity customers, as well as publish it for free online for all Internet users during  a specified annual time period.
“We are honored to partner once again with the Shoah Foundation to bring important films and stories about the Holocaust to millions of people across the nation,” said Charisse R. Lillie, president of the Comcast Foundation, to the Wall Street Journal. “By leveraging our technology and platforms, we are able to help the Institute continue their mission of raising awareness and educating people about overcoming prejudice, intolerance and bigotry.”
Beginning April 8, Comcast will broadcast award-winning films and other features relating to the Holocaust provided by the Shoah Foundation, an organization dedicated to collecting and preserving the testimonies of survivors and other witnesses of the Holocaust. These features will be available at no extra cost through May 25, in accordance with the U.S. National Days of Remembrance (April 27 to May 4), an annual commemoration of the Holocaust.
Every year, the series’ content and theme will be based off of a specific movie related to Holocaust programming. This year’s theme, “The Schindler’s List Legacy Series,” features Spielberg-directed Schindler’s List at the center of the content with a special introduction from the director.
To coincide with the film, documentaries and firsthand accounts of Holocaust survivors and witnesses will be aired, including “Witnesses for the Future: True stories of extraordinary people risking themselves to save others facing genocide” and “The Story of the USC Shoah Foundation: A look at how the USC Shoah Foundation began and its work today.”
In the past, Comcast has broadcast programming related to content regarding human and civil rights. For instance, in 2013, Comcast published “His Dream, Our Stories,” an interactive multimedia video collection to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.
“We’re committed to working with national organizations around the country to support the communities we serve,” said Lisa Ferri, manager of corporate communications at Comcast.
Ferri noted that Comcast has given over $3.2 billion in cash and contributions since 2001 to local nonprofit organizations and other charities nationwide.
To view the Holocaust content, Comcast customers can go to their On Demand library, select the “Specials” category and then choose “Days of Remembrance.” To find the content online, visit Comcast’s website at www.Xfinity.com/daysofremembrance.

On Wednesday, the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences’ Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted the latest installment of Students Talk Back, “From the Pentagon Papers to WikiLeaks: The Government’s Need for Secrecy and the Public’s Right to Know,” featuring Daniel Ellsberg, a former government official best known for his release of the Pentagon Papers in 1971.
Patriot · Daniel Ellsberg, known for releasing the Pentagon Papers in 1971, spoke on technology’s impact on today’s whistleblowers Wednesday. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
The Talk Back series is hosted in conjunction with USC College Democrats, USC College Republicans and the Daily Trojan. The panel was moderated by Kerstyn Olson, interim director of the Unruh Institute, and Heidi Greenhalgh, a graduate research assistant at USC CREATE, the National Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events.
Other panelists included Stan Stahl, president of the Information Systems Security Association of Los Angeles and students Kevin Driscoll, a Ph.D. candidate at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, and Annalise Mantz, the former Editor-in-Chief and current special projects editor of the Daily Trojan.
Olson began the event with a question about the differences between Ellsberg and Edward Snowden, the former CIA employee who revealed classified documents showing the existence of a top-secret government surveillance program.
Ellsberg also spoke about the contrasts between him and             current-day whistleblowers such as Chelsea Manning, a military whistleblower who revealed classified information about the human cost of U.S. violence in Iraq and Afghanistan. Ellsberg questioned Manning’s decision to reveal documents that she was not personally familiar with.
“But now, with digital technology, [Manning] was able to put out hundreds of thousands of documents, a questionable aspect I’ve been doubting from the beginning,” Ellsberg said. “Obviously, [she] put out more than [she] could have read personally. I didn’t do that, and I don’t think I would have done that. That was a problematic thing to do.”
Ellsberg also stated that he, like Edward Snowden, wanted to make sure that people would know who was revealing the information. He believes that he, Manning and Snowden shared a common goal of wanting the public to know what they saw as deceptive government actions.
“None of us joined the military, in Chelsea’s case, or the government, with any thought of being a whistleblower or breaking the promise we made not to reveal any information,” Ellsberg, who worked at Rand Corporation, said. “We had come to realize that to keep that promise was to break our oath, more conscious in their minds, especially Snowden’s, than it was in mine, that we had all taken to support and defend the Constitution, which was very blatantly being violated by the governments we were serving.”
Stahl spoke to the audience about the connections between Ellsberg and current-day whistleblowers.
“We had a very strong belief in the 1960s that, in fact, our government was lying to us,” Stahl said. “It wasn’t just the war in Vietnam, it was also the Civil Rights Movement — that whole time of ferment when, in fact, people were dying for the Constitution and going to jail because of their strong, strong belief that we had to defend the Constitution.”
In response to the issue of how to draw the line between the public’s right to know and classified information, Stahl emphasized that the answer should come from the wider public.
“It’s not ‘Snowden belongs in jail’ versus ‘Snowden’s a hero,’” Stahl said. “It’s, ‘How do we collect the information? How do we put limits on that collection? How do we get a court to approve it?’ And we’re not going to solve that here. We’re going to solve that collectively, all of us, but it means it needs to be in all of your consciousnesses.”
The moderators also asked the students on the panel how they, as journalists, would deal with disseminating classified information to the public.
“What it comes down to for me is the central principle, and one of the reasons I got into journalism is the need to inform people and let our readers know what’s going on,” Mantz said. “That being said, I would want to make sure that I knew exactly what I was publishing and that I have the legal backing-up to do so.”
Driscoll explained that the scope of the general public has become much wider over the past several decades and that its meaning has changed, including people across the globe who might not be considered citizens.
“In the case of Chelsea Manning, I think she imagined a global audience for the documents that she released,” Driscoll said. “And not everybody in that public shares the same rights and access to structures of participatory democracy as other folks do.”
Shayla McMurray, a freshman majoring in gender studies, law, history, and culture and political science, said that she was inspired by the patriotism of the speakers. 
“Overall, the event was really inspiring,” McMurray said. “I thought it was really touching how [Ellsberg] talked about how the word ‘traitor’ might be tossed around colloquially, but the type of impact it has on someone who firmly believes that they’re a patriot like he did.”
Ben Shiroma, a sophomore majoring in electrical engineering, said that the topic was an issue of great importance but that he wished there were more diverse viewpoints regarding whistleblowers on the panel.
“It was an important conversation that needed to be had,” Shiroma said. “However, it would have been nice to have more conflicting views on the panel. Everyone more or less felt the same way, but I feel like there is a need to censor or not release documents that have a potential to harm people.”

Forty years ago this week, ABBA got its big break when the Swedish pop band won the Eurovision Song Contest. “Waterloo,” the band’s first hit single, went on to top charts all over the world. Decades of success for ABBA and, more specifically, the members’ flamboyant costumes followed.
Though ABBA took a permanent hiatus in 1982 after both married couples in the band divorced, the band’s legacy continues to live on, thanks in part to the success of Mamma Mia!. The musical inspired by the band’s greatest hits returned to the Segerstrom Center for the Arts on Tuesday for a one-week run.
There’s just something so joyful about Mamma Mia! The touring production recently celebrated its 15th anniversary, and there is no secret to why the show works so well: It’s the music.
Hits such as “Mamma Mia,” and “Dancing Queen” will always be crowd-pleasers, and watching the musical is like watching one fun, scripted, greatest-hits concert. The musical follows Sophie (Chelsea Williams), who lives on a small Greek island with her single free-spirited mother Donna (Georgia Kate Haege). Before Sophie walks down the aisle, she decides she needs to know the identity of her father — so she invites three men who she believes could be her father to her wedding. Of course, all three men show up for the ceremony, including Donna’s great love, Sam Carmichael (Jeff Drushal).
The easy energy and physicality of the leads set the foundation for the story. Though the plot of Mamma Mia! is essentially an excuse to weave in as many ABBA songs as possible, it doesn’t matter — it works, in part because of the self-aware quality of the musical.
Indeed, Mamma Mia! knows what it is, and maybe because of that, it feels like the actors have more freedom to behave more organically within the world. This isn’t Phantom of the Opera, where Christine Daaé must look and act in a certain way. The music is the only mandatory element in the show. The actors are able to loosen their collars and add their own touches to the performance (and indeed many do  — the plot is set in sunny  Greece, after all, and the cast bares its fair share of skin during the performance). This freedom gives Mamma Mia! a fun, lively feel, aided by the goofy physicality of the dance numbers.
There is a teasing quality to numbers such as “Lay All Your Love on Me,” where the bachelor party takes to the stage in full diving regalia, complete with flippers and snorkel gear, and circles around Sophie. These scenes are over the top, but they work here.
The other factor that drives Mamma Mia! is the nostalgia, which is there in spades. Whether or not you lived through the disco era, the exaggerated outfits (it’s easy to get lost in the bejeweled bell-bottoms, funky shoes and crazy-colored shirts), easy bohemian lifestyles and “girl power” of the decade bring you back to an imagined ideal of that time. It has a comfort and a familiarity to it, and whether you’re watching the performance for the first or the fifth time, it feels like reconnecting with an old friend.
The three-song encore after the show, including the high-energy “Mamma Mia,” “Dancing Queen” and the song that started it all, “Waterloo,” is the cherry on top to the performance. The entire cast comes out, dancing and singing in celebration of the musical. During opening night on Tuesday, the entire audience stayed on their feet through all three encores, happy to be able to sing, dance and be a part of the performance in their own way.
Forty years after the Eurovision Song Contest, ABBA still holds the power to get an entire audience standing in their seats, and dancing. And if one was looking for a message in this vibrant musical, it just might be as simple as this: “Thank you for the music.”
 
Mamma Mia is playing now through April 13 at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts.

Game of Thrones is back, and the bodies — from warm-blooded lovers to frostbitten corpses — are already piling up.
The unpaid debt · The fourth season of HBO’s Game of Thrones introduces Oberyn Martell, played by Pedro Pascal, a vengeful libertine who blames the Lannisters, including Tyrion, played by Peter Dinklage, for the death of his beloved sister. – Photo courtesy of HBO
Eleven months after the horrific events of the Red Wedding left millions of viewers simultaneously anguished and awestruck, HBO’s adaptation of George R.R. Martin’s sprawling fantasy series returned with a vengeance last Sunday. The fourth season’s premiere episode, “Two Swords,” was a conscious effort to convince audiences — especially those familiar with the books — that the show’s narrative momentum hasn’t slowed in the wake of the Lannisters’ treacherous victory over House Stark in the penultimate episode of the third season. In fact, between the ice zombie menace to the North and Daenerys Targaryen’s dragon-assisted slave rebellion to the South, “Two Swords” suggests that the stakes have never been higher. Winter has come to Westeros, and the real battle for the Iron Throne is just getting started.
The episode opens in King’s Landing, with ruthless patriarch and architect of the Red Wedding Tywin Lannister, played once again with magisterial disdain by the great Charles Dance, melting down the late Robb Stark’s prized Valyrian sword and forging two new blades in its place. The first is meant for his son Jaime, played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who has rejoined the Kingsguard against his father’s wishes while adjusting to life as a permanent southpaw. The second blade is a wedding present for Tywin’s grandson, the loathsome King Joffrey, played to smirking, sniveling perfection by Jack Gleeson. The symbolism is inescapable: The Lannisters have secured their right to rule and are now free to recast history as they please.
Yet as any bald eunuch with constantly shifting allegiances will tell you, power is a curious thing. In truth, the Lannister victory is fragile and illusory at best. Fan-favorite Tyrion Lannister, portrayed by Emmy winner Peter Dinklage, knows this all too well. After years of watching his father and scheming sister Cersei (Lena Headey) forsake honor in order to crush their enemies and expand their influence, the cunning imp — who’s still trying to circumvent his arranged marriage to the grieving Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) and help the poor girl escape the gilded cage of King’s Landing once and for all — knows that nothing gained as a result of the Red Wedding is built to last.
This ominous feeling only intensifies after he meets Prince Oberyn Martell, played by newcomer Pedro Pascal, who’s in town to attend the royal wedding of Joffrey and the coyly manipulative Margaery Tyrell (Natalie Dormer). Oberyn, also known as the Red Viper, is a swaggering hedonist whose omnivorous sexual appetite is exceeded only by his desire for vengeance against Lannister henchman Gregor “The Mountain” Clegane (played by Hafthor Julius Bjornsson), who raped and murdered his younger sister during the dethronement of the Mad King many years earlier. He makes no secret of his true agenda, telling Tyrion, “The Lannisters aren’t the only ones who pay their debts.”
The rest of the Seven Kingdoms are also on edge following the deaths of Robb and Catelyn Stark and the dissolving of the Northern Army, proving that even the calm between the storms is fraught with peril in Westeros. After months spent on a deep-cover mission beyond the Wall, Jon Snow (Kit Harington) is facing trial for cavorting with wildlings, including his fiery ex-lover Ygritte (Rose Leslie), while desperately trying to warn his Night’s Watch brothers about the encroaching Free Folk Army led by Mance Rayder (Ciarán Hinds), who plans to lay siege to Castle Black and slaughter its inhabitants.
Elsewhere, pint-sized swashbuckler Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) has entered into an unholy alliance with her fearsome enemy-turned-traveling-companion the Hound (Rory McCann), roaming the countryside and killing Lannister bannermen on their way to reunite with her remaining family in Riverrun. It’s been fascinating to watch Arya’s progression from precocious moppet to traumatized orphan to avenging angel over the course of the last three seasons, but that admiration quickly gives way to concern when the episode reveals the extent of her emerging bloodlust.
Then there’s Daenerys (Emilia Clarke), who seems on the precipice of raising a free army large enough to sail to Westeros and reclaim her birthright, if only she can keep control of her rapidly maturing, increasingly dangerous dragons. Watching the last Targaryen — the last one we know of, anyway — decide whether to be a liberator or a conqueror was one of last season’s principal pleasures, and it’s a choice she’ll likely face again if she ever makes it across the sea.
After three seasons of beheadings, royal incest and spontaneous smoke demon births, Game of Thrones could be forgiven for settling into more familiar rhythms, but showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss appear determined to continue expanding and refining the already insanely ambitious series, which was renewed for a fifth and sixth season the week following the premiere. The onus now falls on Martin, who writes the occasional episode and recently released a chapter from the series’ newest installment, The Winds of Winter, to keep pace with the show while crafting a quality finale that will be worthy of the meticulous, miraculous world he’s created.
Self-mythology and the limits of control have been the major themes of the season thus far, whether it be Tywin’s obsession with his legacy, Stannis Baratheon’s attempts to control the fate of his enemies by appealing to the Lord of Light or Arya and the Hound’s hilarious but telling argument over whether it’s ever appropriate to name one’s sword. As always, the show’s greatest strength isn’t its rousing action scenes or its majestic highland settings but rather its willingness to upend audience expectations and reveal hidden depths to characters that, at first glance, seem like stodgy fantasy archetypes.
Game of Thrones is a story with no clear-cut heroes or villains, just a bunch of deeply flawed individuals struggling for a sense of power and purpose in a world where wickedness is sometimes rewarded and kindness can be a punishable offense, where the outcomes feel surprising and authentic instead of clumsy and predetermined. In an age where so much of our fiction is drowned in formula, what more can one ask for?
Just don’t expect a happy ending. As Tyrion himself says: “If you want justice, you’ve come to the wrong place.”

It is an undeniable truth that there is nothing better than a delicious pizza. Sure, one could settle for some Domino’s on Figueroa Street but when an appetite calls for a quality, hand-tossed, wood-fired pizza, look no further than Pizzeria Olio.
Photo courtesy of Kevin Steele
The Hollywood-based pizzeria was founded by USC Marshall School of Business alumnus Brad Kent.
Pizzeria Olio originally opened its doors in 2010 after running a successful mobile pizza business that serviced Manhattan Beach, Calif. and catered events. Since then, the restaurant has recently opened a location in Downtown L.A., housed in the bustling, iconic Grand Central Market.
The management team of the market approached Kent last year with an offer to open a stall within the historic market, as a part of an effort to revitalize the L.A. landmark. After months of planning and preparation, the stall finally made its debut on March 30.
The market is currently home to an extensive farmers market and butcher stalls, but has since decided to expand its presence downtown. It now includes various restaurants to attract the lunchtime crowds of the business center of the city. Unfortunately, the market is only open until 6 p.m. each day, which is a definite setback for this restaurant’s business.
The stall has a traditional pizzeria vibe, with yellow tiled walls and a beautifully tiled wood fire oven blazing in the corner. It serves 10-inch personal wood-fired pizzas and “focaccia salads,” along with beers on tap, wines and soft drinks.
The menu has a range of selections, from a classic Margherita to a delicious wild mushroom and crisp prosciutto pie. Though the full menu only reaches this location in early May, customers will not be disappointed in the pizzas they buy here.
Many customers, however, are unaware that Grand Central Market hosts these type of places. Upon talking to one person of the people working at the Pizzeria Olio stall, business is great at the lunch rush, but pretty dead otherwise. They hope that the market’s reputation will pick up so that more people will know that this new location exists.
Pizzeria Olio uses fresh ingredients in all its pizzas, and customers can taste the difference. The Margherita pizza boasts flavorful mozzarella cheese with rich, creamy tomato sauce. The crust is crispy but cooked to perfection.
In addition, service at the stall is impeccable. The first pizza served wasn’t cooked according to their standard, so they cooked a whole new one. Incidentally, both pizzas turned out to be delicious, but it just goes to show how important the quality of its food is to the restaurant.
The salads, unfortunately aren’t available yet, but zagat rated Pizzeria Olio one of the top 10 pizzerias in the country.
Overall, the experience at Pizzeria Olio is exceptional. For one who is usually apprehensive about trying new things downtown, this new restaurant has set a standard. Given the rising competition in the market as it is revitalized and diversified, Pizzeria Olio is definitely a star among the Grand Central Market stalls.
 
Pizzeria Olio is located on 317 Broadway. It is open daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.

USC’s 13th-ranked women’s tennis team will have an opportunity to redeem itself  this weekend after suffering back-to-back losses at No. 12 Cal and No. 4 Stanford.
Break the chain · Freshman Zoë Katz has lost her last four singles matches, but hopes to get back to her winning ways this weekend. The Los Angeles native is currently ranked No. 101 in the nation. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Both the Bears (14-4, 7-0 Pac-12) and the Cardinal (14-1, 6-1) swept the Women of Troy (14-6, 5-2), dealing USC its first two conference losses of the season and spoiling the team’s chances at replicating its undefeated Pac-12 mark from last year.
With the losses, the Women of Troy fell into a fourth-place tie in the conference standings, two matches behind Cal and a match behind No. 2 UCLA and Stanford.
USC is now gearing up for its last home stand of the season, as No. 19 Arizona State comes to town on Friday and No. 25 Arizona visits USC on Saturday. All three teams are tied with a 5-2 mark in conference play.
The 19th-ranked Sun Devils are coming off of a 4-0 win over Colorado and a 4-2 win over Utah last weekend. Arizona State boasts two nationally-ranked singles players in No. 49 Desirae Krawczyk and No. 68 Stephanie Vlad. In addition, Krawczyk and Kassidy Jump comprise the 85th-ranked doubles team in the nation.
Arizona will also come to Los Angeles having recently topped Utah, 7-0, and Colorado, 5-2. Much like their rival Sun Devils, the Wildcats have two players ranked in singles: No. 60 Lacey Smith and No. 61 Lauren Marker. Arizona has no ranked doubles teams.
Meanwhile, USC boasts four ranked players in singles. Junior Sabrina Santamaria is ranked No. 17 in the nation, but she sustained an ACL injury in March that sidelined her for the remainder of the season.
Junior Zoë Scandalis, who has taken over Santamaria’s spot on USC’s top singles court, is next at No. 26. Junior Giuliana Olmos is ranked 76th in the nation, and freshman Zoë Katz rounds out the group at No. 101.
Ranked doubles teams for the Women of Troy include the tandem of Olmos and Scandalis, who land at No. 6. The team of Katz and senior Brynn Boren, meanwhile, currently sits at No. 13. Santamaria and senior Kaitlyn Christian, the defending national champions in doubles, come in at No. 25.
If history repeats itself, USC’s chances of dispatching the Arizona schools and climbing back into the Pac-12 contender race are solid. Last year, the Women of Troy took home two resounding wins on a road trip to the Grand Canyon State defeating the Sun Devils 7-0 and the Wildcats 6-1. USC was led in those matches by Olmos and Santamaria, who each captured two straight set wins in singles. Still, given the loss of Santamaria to injury and the team’s poor play last weekend, this year’s matches should be more competitive.
Interestingly, another good omen for the Women of Troy could be their current two-game losing streak. The two previous times this season that the team lost back-to-back matches, it went on to rattle off five straight wins.
USC’s next two games mark its second-to-last weekend of Pac-12 play. On April 18, the team travels to face UCLA, looking for revenge after having fallen to the Bruins twice this season already (once in the ITA National Team Indoor Tournament by a 4-0 score and again last month, 5-2). A week later, both teams will travel to the Pac-12 championships in Ojai, Calif.

Blah blah blah, quarterbacks.Blah blah blah, Cody Kessler.Blah blah blah, Max Browne.
Blah blah blah blah blah.
Top dog · Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler, who threw for 212 yards per game last year, will likely sit atop the depth chart come fall. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
After USC’s football practice on Tuesday, head coach Steve Sarkisian said he “would suspect” he’d name a presumptive starting quarterback by the end of spring. Wow! What news! What a dramatic impact this will have on the season. Stop the presses, everyone.
Of course, I jest a little bit. This is not a completely insignificant statement, especially after Lane Kiffin dragged last year’s quarterback battle two full games into the season.
But let’s be honest, it’s not that significant either.
There are still close to five months before USC’s season kicks off against Fresno State on Aug. 30. There are still four spring practices and the entirety of fall camp. When Sark “officially” announces redshirt junior Cody Kessler (presumably) as his starting quarterback in the near future, there will still be plenty of time for the head coach to reconsider, or for Kessler’s competitor, redshirt freshman Max Browne, to make him do so.
And for anyone who has seen much of spring ball, this is a non-event. There is one quarterback that has outplayed the other, and generally speaking, that makes him the starter. That was part of what made last season’s ordeal between Kessler and his classmate Max Wittek (who has since announced that he will transfer) so frustrating. To many observers of fall camp, Kessler was the obvious choice. Wittek may have had superior physical tools, but ultimately, those don’t matter if you don’t have the mental ones.
This spring is a similar situation. Browne, like Wittek, is more physically gifted than Kessler. He looks like a quarterback. In an “ideal” world, he would have emerged as the starter. But you can’t just look the part, you have to play it too. And just like in his competition with Wittek, Kessler’s command of the offense and grasp of the playbook is obviously better than Browne’s.
So there’s no reason to overreact, or react much at all, to Sarkisian’s statement. First and foremost, he will simply be stating the obvious — for the time being. Cody Kessler, right now, gives USC the best chance to win.
But as previously mentioned, USC isn’t playing games right now. Nor will they next week, or next month, for that matter. An awful lot can change between “right now” and Aug. 30. Max Browne will have the entire summer to further his understanding of Steve Sarkisian’s new playbook (then again, so will Kessler, and there is no substitute for actual reps, during a game or in practice). Sarkisian made it clear that his choice is not set in stone. Rather, he will “watch for a little bit … and see what it feels like” after he names the starter.
For now, however, quarterback speculation is just that: speculation. It means nothing, or at least next to nothing. Cody Kessler will probably enter fall camp on top of the depth chart, where he spent (almost) the entirety of last season. He’ll take reps with the first-team — good for him. Max Browne will enter as the No. 2 guy. But those positions aren’t locked. If Browne outperforms Kessler in the fall, it won’t matter who did what in the spring.
The best player will play. That is what Steve Sarkisian is doing now, and that is what I imagine he will do come fall.
Until then, you know what I think. Blah blah blah blah blah.

USC’s second-ranked men’s tennis team looks to continue its success this weekend on a two-game road trip. On Friday, the Trojans take on the unranked Arizona Wildcats in Tucson, and on Saturday they head to Salt Lake City to take on the No. 51 Utah Utes.
Work horse · Senior co-captain Michael Grant has proven his worth as a consistent starter this season, going 10-1 in dual-match play. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (22-2, 4-0 Pac-12) are riding high off of their sweeps of Stanford and California last week. USC went 7-0 against Stanford and 4-0 against Cal, perfectly propelling them into another round of Pac-12 action.
“Cal and Stanford have always been big rivals [of ours],” senior co-captain Michael Grant said. “It’s nice to beat them the way we did.”
Junior Jonny Wang said the wins were a “crucial part of  Pac-12 play” and that the intensity the team brought to the last two games is something they’re hoping to maintain.
Wang and Grant are just two of USC’s six singles players ranked in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s top 125. Senior co-captain Ray Sarmiento leads the way at No. 7, down slightly from the No. 3 ranking he held for a few weeks before losing two straight singles matches at Oregon and Washington. Next is junior Yannick Hanfmann, who sits at No. 17 in the nation. Wang is ranked No. 46, and junior Roberto Quiroz is ranked No. 53. Sophomore Max de Vroome has fought his way back into the national rankings and is slotted at No. 94. Grant rounds out the group with a No. 107 ranking.
Sarmiento and Hanfmann have climbed up to the No. 4 spot in doubles together, and Grant and freshman Nick Crystal make up the 57th-ranked duo in the country.
The Trojans are heading into the homestretch of the season, and Wang says USC’s coaching staff has been key in keeping the Trojans motivated to make sure they don’t burn out.
“[The] coaches have really kept us on track,” Wang said. “They push us every day and keep us really focused, not just on the result. We’ve really focused on the process, more so than the goal.”
USC is currently riding an impressive 13-match win streak dating back to the end of February. Quiroz has prevailed in singles play in each of these 13 matches, bringing his dual-match record to 17-1 on the season. Quiroz and freshman Nick Crystal have also won five straight doubles matches together.
USC seems to have a good shot at extending its winning streak against the Wildcats (11-12, 0-4), who have no ranked players in singles or doubles. Meanwhile, Arizona has dropped four consecutive matches and looks to break that  losing streak against the Trojans.
USC head coach Peter Smith doesn’t want his team getting complacent heading into this kind of matchup, so he has tried to keep things interesting in practice, and the players are responding positively.
“We’ve been working out a lot more — morning workouts, workouts on the beach, or where the girls volleyball team [plays],” de Vroome said. “It’s just getting [us] stronger, more ready for the next games.”
Make no mistake, though: This beach approach isn’t meant to loosen up the team, but to strengthen the players and to serve as a team bonding experience.
“The sand is super soft on us,” Grant said. “So it’s pushing us really hard and working really well.”
This unconventional training has also prepared the team to take on Utah (14-5, 2-2), a team that has won two straight matches. Last weekend, the Utes traveled to Oregon and Washington and netted two 4-2 victories, despite having no ranked singles or doubles players.
The Trojans insist that they don’t pay attention to their opponents’ records, though, and focus instead on their own individual and team game.
“I’ve been working on my footwork and getting closer to the net,” de Vroome said. “[I feel] very confident about what’s coming next, so I’m looking forward to it.”
The Trojans kick off their weekend trip on Friday at Arizona at 1:30 p.m., before traveling to Utah to take on the Utes Sunday at 1 p.m. MST.

This past weekend, the USC women’s rowing team earned an unprecedented fourth-straight Jessop-Whittier Cup at the 41st annual San Diego Crew Classic in Mission Bay, Calif. It was the fourth-ranked Women of Troy’s fifth title in the tournament.

The Jessop-Whittier Cup is an invitational event at the San Diego Crew Classic, and USC sent its first varsity eight-man team to compete. Junior Paige Fernandes was the coxswain, while senior Vineta Moca stroked the boat. Junior Krisztina Gyimes, sophomore Madara Strautmane, sophomore Keret Einaste, senior Madelyn Walters, junior Elizabeth Turner, sophomore Lindsay Gibson and freshman Svenja Jonas were at the bow for the victorious Women of Troy.
Additionally, the Women of Troy claimed their second straight Karen Plumleigh Cortney Cup. It was USC’s third overall win at the event. Last year, the Women of Troy won all three races at the Crew Classic.
Ranked No. 4 in the nation coming into the race, the Women of Troy competed against Washington, Washington State, San Diego, Wisconsin and crosstown rival UCLA. Junior Katherine Gleadow felt that her team was successful in executing its race plan.
“For us, we have a pretty simple race plan,” Gleadow told USCTrojans. “[Freshman] Kaelyn [Ibold] is pretty good at executing it. She is very good at listening to other coxswains’ calls and responding to them even if she can’t see them. It was fun and we’re still testing to see what we can do.”
USC’s second varsity eight took third in its Grand Final for the Jackie Ann Stitt Hungness Memorial Trophy. Trojans’ Novice advanced to the Grand Final for the Laurel V. Korholz Perpetual Memorial Trophy. In total, four boats pushed ahead to the Grand Final races.
“I’m very pleased with what we did today,” USC head coach Zenon Babraj told USCTrojans.com. “In the first eight, we had a very clear plan of what we wanted to do in the race and they went out there and executed it 100-percent, so it was very satisfying. I felt that the boat has gotten more and more confident and they executed the plan and that’s why we won the race.”
Coming up this Saturday and Sunday, women’s rowing will compete at the Third Annual Lake Natoma Invitational. Last year, USC claimed the Natoma Invitational title, conquering California and Stanford in the finals. This year’s event, which will feature Cal and Stanford as well as San Diego, Sacramento State, Oklahoma, Brown and Kansas, will be televised all day on the Pac-12 Networks. The Women of Troy will take a two-week break after this weekend’s action, resting up for a dual meet with the Cardinal on April 26.
Gleadow has high expectations for the rest of the season.
“I think we always have the highest expectations of ourselves,” Gleadow told USCTrojans.com. “It was nice to see what kind of speed we have even though we still have a long way to go this season. I think we can only improve from here.”

The situation in the Ukraine and Crimea, a peninsula that was formerly under the auspices of the Ukrainian government, has been convoluted in sorts over the past few months. Though the U.S. media narrative has bordered on sensationalist, it should instead focus on how to engage with the Russian leadership diplomatically rather than convey the favor of anxious war hawks.
Last fall, protests erupted in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev over former President Viktor Yanukovych’s plan to depart from ties with Europe and focus more on relations with Moscow. Protesters in Kiev’s Independence Square were adamantly opposed to any further ties with Russia and opposed the government’s decision to formulate any close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Protests took place for weeks, and hundreds were killed until Feb. 21, when opposition leaders and Yanukovych agreed to dissolve the current government and hold new elections. Yanukovych subsequently lost all power and fled Kiev for Russia. Two days later, on Feb. 23, parliament appointed Oleksandr Turchynov president.
Less than a week after the ouster of Yanukovych, Russian troops invaded Crimea and took control of the peninsula off the coast of the Black Sea. Even though the annexation was peaceful, the Western world decried breaches of sovereignty and international law. Russian troops had occupied all military bases in Crimea and effectively forced Ukrainian troops out of the area. Russia released a referendum to the Crimean people to see if they wanted to secede from Ukraine. Ninety-six percent of voters approved the referendum; however, the veracity of the election remains under serious question. But Crimea is currently under control of Russian military troops.
Throughout the crisis in the Ukraine and Crimea, many have called President Barack Obama a weak leader and ineffective in negotiating with Putin to withdraw troops. Much of the opposition has come from right-wing conservatives who believe the United States should be more firm and aggressive in exacting power in the region.
The lesson to be learned from the whole situation is that Russia is beginning to flex its muscles in a post-Cold War world. Many might see Putin’s deployment of troops in Crimea and the eastern border of Ukraine as a move to usurp power and steadily annex the entire Soviet sphere, including the Baltic States and Eastern Europe. That might be the case, but upon closer inspection of the trends in Russia, Putin’s moves might very well just be a way to showcase to the world Russia is a supreme power again and is rising in its military and economic prowess.
Russia is a part of the so-called BRICS nations, comprised of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Collectively, they represent the burgeoning economies and political powers of the 21st century. Since the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Russia has struggled to regain its balance and place a footprint on the world stage. Though many might see Putin as an aggressor and antagonist of the West, his moves to massively build up the Russian military, increase pay for soldiers and turn an institution around that has traditionally lacked professionalism and respect are all chapters in a larger narrative to beef up Russia’s perception in the world.
All the fuss and fury over the Kremlin’s actions are merited. Calls for military buildup in the region and deployment of NATO troops to provoke Putin fail to recognize the bigger picture, however. Putin’s actions in Crimea are not tantamount to Hitler’s buildup prior to World War II and the annexation of Crimea is not a declaration of war. Instead of viewing Russia as a serious threat to world peace, the situation should be viewed with a lens that fosters diplomacy and talks with Moscow, rather than Pentagon contingency plans for World War III. The U.S. narrative on the issue in the media should center on how to deal with Putin diplomatically rather than spread sensationalistic fervor currying the favor of anxious war hawks.
As the situation stands now, the Obama administration should continue its talks with Putin and prevent further buildup of troops along Eastern Europe. Sovereignty should be given to the Ukraine, and the U.S. should be fully involved and active in peace talks. Military action is not the solution and diplomacy should be utilized until the situation drastically changes course.

It was a statement that only a Congressman who isn’t up for reelection could make.
“I think the American people should know that the members of Congress are underpaid,” said Representative James Moran, a Democrat from Virginia who is retiring at the end of this session, in an interview with CQ Roll Call.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
For background, consider that many are calling the 113th Congress the most unproductive in years. As of last December, the last Congress to pass fewer bills than this one adjourned in 1947.
The latest Gallup poll put Congressional approval at 15 percent. As a friend of mine who is running for Congress in November likes to put it, “I want to know what 15 percent of Americans think Congress is doing a good job.”
And these people deserve a pay raise? According to some, the answer is yes. When the blogosphere lit up with those eager to slam Moran’s foolish suggestion, some jumped to his defense. The most basic argument seems to be that he misspoke — the legislative change that Moran ended up pushing yesterday (which failed miserably) was to give members a per diem (or stipend) for each day they spend in Washington.
Moran’s call for a pay raise also started a more interesting conversation, one that doesn’t seem to be getting its due time in the sun.
According to Salon writer Alex Pareene, Congress’s meager pay is enough to incentivize them to both take heavy donations that take advantage of lax campaign finance laws and to quit their jobs early to get richer in the private sector.
“And in a world where campaign finance regulations are constantly getting gutted by the courts, paying members a fortune and letting them fund their own campaigns is basically halfway to public financing of elections,” Pareene said.
Pareene is right on the fact, but wrong on the argument. Why don’t we just cut to the chase and get serious about campaign finance reform? Even Moran seemed to acknowledge in his interview that one of the big reasons why a pay raise for Congress might be so unpopular is because Congress isn’t perceived as poor — and anyone that sees Super Pac’s loaded with cash from billionaires such as the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson can’t be blamed for this misperception.
The problem with campaign finance reform is that the U.S. is quickly running in the wrong direction. Last week, the Supreme Court struck down overall limits on the amount donors can give to political parties and candidates. The limit an individual can give to a single candidate ($2,600) is still law, but the decision struck down the limit on how many $2,600 gifts an individual can give out.
The lesson that folks such as Moran and Pareene seem to have drawn from this decision is a rather nihilist one — namely, that campaign finance reform is hopeless and that the solution to ending corruption is to simply pay our elected officials more from the public purse. Maybe then, they say, members of Congress will be less beholden to Super PAC’s and special interest groups.
Moran and Pareene should watch a few episodes of House of Cards. U.S. elected officials and journalists shouldn’t let another misguided decision from the Supreme Court derail the quest to make politics less corrupt. Paying Congress more is a feel-good and temporary solution, and anyone that thinks increasing Congress’s travel stipend is a meaningful solution to corruption should have his or her head examined.
Moran’s call is a distraction and one that should be ignored. Unfortunately, it seems there were more articles, blog posts and tweets making fun of him than there were articles lambasting the Supreme Court for striking another blow to democracy that was McCutcheon v. FEC, the above-discussed decision that was handed down last week.
Though it’s true that calls for increased pay during one of the most unproductive Congressional sessions ever makes for juicier headlines, Supreme Court decisions that continue to expand the role of money in politics are far more deadly for democracy. Moran’s solution is a wolf in sheep’s clothing that funnels money into politics in a different fashion — the solution is to get rid of it altogether.

Sports and music have always been not-so-strange bedfellows — just look at Sheryl Crowe and Lance Armstrong, or Madonna and Alex Rodriguez, to name a few. But in recent years, this marriage has gone beyond celebrity relationships as the institutions themselves are becoming increasingly “synonymous.”
Each passing year, it seems like there are more references to star athletes (particularly basketball players) in hip-hop. Just this past week, however, Drake took this phenomenon to a whole new level with his single,”Draft Day,” which is essentially a personalized pump-up song for Johnny Manziel’s impending journey to the NFL Draft. In the song, Drake parallels his own rise to that of Manziel, saying, “Man that boy growin’ up quick, that boy know he the sh*t.” The well-publicized friendship of the two celebrities is certainly at least in part based on their shared fame from a very young age.

But some star athletes have more in common with rappers than the celebrity experience. Occasionally they’ll drop a few bars themselves. In the offseason of 2000, all-star point guard Allen Iverson recorded a rap single, “40 Bars.” The song was never commercially released due to its derogatory and homophobic content, which was severely criticized by the likes of NBA commissioner David Stern.
In spite of Iverson’s highly publicized failure in the hip-hop scene, athletes continue to dabble in the art form, albeit in a more lighthearted spirit. On April Fools Day of this year, TMZ released a recording of Lebron James rapping over the beat of “F**kWithMeYouKnowIGotIt” by Jay Z. James’ flow isn’t much better than Iverson’s, but at least he doesn’t say anything that would disappoint his impressionable young fans.
While more conventional explanations of this “marriage” can be attributed to the African American community’s predominance in both basketball and hip hop, there are other, more subtle and perhaps more sinister forces at play.
Many of America’s favorite athletes and pop stars are represented by the same elite talent agencies that are constantly looking to find innovative new ways to create more value out of their clients. The Creative Artists Agency (CAA) is particularly notorious. In a Grantland podcast, former NBA all-star and media personality Jalen Rose described the agency as “the biggest conglomerate in sports and entertainment in the world.” After being established in 2006, CAA’s sports division has represented superstars like David Beckham, Derek Jeter and Lebron James.
Conglomerates like CAA know how to turn talented people into universally recognizable brands. To them, designations like “athlete” or “musician” both translate to “marketable celebrity.” It is in the best interest of the money behind all forms of commercial art and entertainment to present an interconnected and monolithic vision of pop culture. And it’s only Draft Day. Sports and music will surely only become more intimate as the media age progresses.

The first meeting of the new USG Senate kicked off on Tuesday night, featuring the newly appointed senators presenting their campaign platforms.
Commuter senators stressed USG’s role in connecting students who live off campus to the greater student body.
“I want to make commuters feel more connected to campus, so they feel like they’re part of the larger Trojan Family,” commuter senator Briana Thorpe said.
As a transfer student from LMU and a commuter herself, Thorpe believes she is well informed in addressing the challenges her constituents face.
The commuter senators also stressed revising the university’s parking policy to accommodate students with cars, and to allow more parking spaces for home football games.
The Greek senators’ presentations focused on the university’s relationship with the Row, as well as improving the quality of life on campus. Among the issues addressed were a new “Greeks Go Green” initiative, the planned renovations of Leavey Library and the need to improve athletic facilities for students.
“I’d like to have more student input into the development University Village,” Greek Senator Logan Burkhead said.
Residential Senators’ concerns were various.
“My goals are partnering with activists and philanthropic organizations, increasing student participation and … increasing the number of forums per semester,” senator Maddie Lees said.
Lees’ running partner, Brandon Chang, also had suggestions.
“I’d like to create a unified calendar of events for all student [organizations], get an increase in USG’s programming budget — which hasn’t risen for almost a decade — and reduce security costs on campus.”
Chang said that, in certain instances, the cost of on-campus security has been earmarked on a budget for “campus development and enrichment,” which he believes is a disservice to tuition-paying students.
Chang served as a residential senator during 2013-14, and was elected for a second term.
Samantha Cheng, another second-term USG Senator and speaker pro tempore, also had very specific ideas.
“We need some more water stations around campus, so students get water on campus during the day,” Cheng said. “I’d also like to discontinue non-USC solicitation on campus.”
So far, USG has passed a resolution to ban on on-campus solicitation, but there has been no clear policy change thus far.
The meeting ended with a sense of expectation, as Vice President Rini Sampath urged senators to talk to their constituents and meet with student organizations.
“We’re all talking to different organizations to get the ball rolling, and hopefully cause some change on campus,” Sampath said.
