In its first senate meeting of the semester held Tuesday over Zoom, the Undergraduate Student Government welcomed its new speaker of the senate Tommy Nguyen and senator Nicholas Yang. Nguyen, a senior majoring in history, has served as a senator since last March. Yang, a sophomore majoring in business administration, was promoted from his previous role as senate aide. The changes follow former speaker of the senate Ruben Romeo’s December resignation. 
“I’m excited to do a lot of good work this semester,” said Nguyen in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I feel like it’s been a big struggle. We have a lot of support and a lot of funding; I’m in a very privileged position … Speaking of administration, I think the best I can do in my position is to work as hard as possible.”
The programming branch also introduced three new hires for various student assemblies. Vincent Hsueh, a senior majoring in pharmacology and drug development and applied analytics, was hired as the new co-executive director of the Student Assembly for Accessibility; Chloe Hirth, a senior majoring in political science, for executive director of the Political Student Assembly and Paola Samaniego, a senior majoring in business administration, for assistant director of Speakers.
There were also two promotions within the programming branch, with Julia Gallaway, a senior majoring in environmental studies and international relations, global business, assuming a new role as co-executive director of the Environmental Student Assembly and Connor Castillo, a sophomore majoring in environmental studies, starting as ESA’s new assistant director. 
Following the programming branch’s announcements, senator Devin Ayala gave a presentation about some of USG’s plans for the semester, including creating a resolution to support the compensation of resident assistants, continuing to work for the Garden Club and helping to fund Trojan Food Pantry. Ayala also aims to work with USG’s internal committees to tackle Department of Public Safety concerns, take on issues with the Fryft program and mobilize the senate into the community. 
Parliamentary secretary Zaid Diaz-Arias said his role has allowed him to collaborate with people from “many different backgrounds” and is excited to continue helping staff in any way possible. 
“This semester, I want to expand my communication with all senators …  as I’ve felt a little disconnected from the rest of the senate,” said Diaz-Arias in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “My goal for this semester is to collaborate more with the other members, helping them on their projects and let them know I’m there to support them.”
When the meeting opened for discussion, senator Brian Stowe shared his concerns about his work with the different community groups that have yet to achieve assembly status and thus have limited resources.
“One of the main reasons I got involved with the student government is because I want to advocate for the addition of student assembly groups into the programming department,” said Stowe in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
To form designated assemblies within USG, groups are required to demonstrate need. Stowe said he has been working to vocalize the needs of certain groups, such as ROTC-affiliated students, through clear communication between these groups and USG. Organizations also need two sponsoring senators to represent them and give a presentation on why the group should be incorporated as an assembly to the programming branch. This is succeeded by a vote on whether USG wants to incorporate the group into its programming branch, which Stowe said will likely take place in March. 
Even if this isn’t the start to the semester he imagined, Nguyen said he really looks forward to this semester and that everyone is trying to “adapt” and “be flexible.” 
“Although it’s been a slow start, I hope USG can reach out to more of USC by being more accessible,” Nguyen said. “As a student government, I hope we can uplift all the other students and give them the resources and the support to identify their problems.”

A few days before his scheduled departure on Dec. 8, Divyam Jindal, a freshman majoring in economics and mathematics, checked with American Airlines about his upcoming flight home to India. He was surprised to discover it had been cancelled, and he was rescheduled to a flight through London. That was soon canceled too, and he received a refund. Another booking and rescheduling later, Jindal finally arrived in Delhi on a Dec. 14 Qatar Airways flight, his ticket ultimately costing three times more than the original.
Throughout December, the rise of the omicron variant caused a slew of flight cancellations and changes in travel restrictions, disrupting travel plans for many. As the coronavirus pandemic continues to evolve, the uncertainty it brings continues to present a challenge for students, especially those who came to study at USC from abroad.
“During these times, you never know when a flight’s going to be canceled because of COVID or some other reason,” Jindal said. “Plus, even on the flight, you’re a little scared you might get COVID because of omicron spreading so rapidly … You get kind of afraid that flights might get banned altogether. There’s just a lot of stress that goes into planning an international trip during these times.”
Before winter break, Jindal evaluated the coronavirus situation in India at the time and talked to his friends in similar situations. If he went back home, there was a chance he wouldn’t be able to return to campus for in-person learning in the spring semester. On the other hand, Jindal was eager to see his family after his first four months away at college, and he knew being at home would provide a boost to his mental health. Ultimately, like several of his friends, he decided to make the journey.
“As an international student, it’s a big thing for me to come home. For the first time in my life, I have spent four months away from my family,” Jindal said. “The biggest pro was getting to see my family and my friends coming back home, just chilling out for a little bit. I really needed that.”
Once in Delhi, Jindal underwent a self-imposed quarantine for seven days. Over winter break, his building experienced an increase in coronavirus cases, putting it at risk of becoming a containment zone. Although the University postponed the start of in-person classes to Jan. 24, leading some students to delay their return to campus, Jindal flew back Jan. 10 in case a continued increase in coronavirus cases and restrictions in his building prevented his departure.
Beginning Dec. 17, the CDC requires individuals to take a coronavirus test between 24 and 48 hours before traveling to Los Angeles and between 24 and 48 hours after arrival. For Jindal, obtaining appropriate testing took careful coordination, especially for the day he planned to leave, when plane tickets were most affordable. Jindal’s flight to L.A. was on a Sunday, when most labs in Delhi, he said, are closed. Finding the right lab posed another issue.
“With the testing, it has been a little bit of a mess because some of the labs in India are not accredited to whatever is required by the airlines or the airport,” Jindal said. “And there are a lot of labs … You would be amazed.”
Several international students remained on campus over winter break, including Ricky Wang, a freshman majoring in sociology. He decided that the quarantine policies in his hometown of Beijing, China — a two-week hotel quarantine followed by a one week self-imposed quarantine — weren’t worth the trip.
“My parents told me about the policy, and when I knew, I just thought, ‘Yeah, let’s not go back. Let’s just stay,’” Wang said. “It’s fine because I’m not that homesick. I can eat Chinese food and speak Chinese with my friends. I can Zoom or call my parents whenever I want. It’s just the time difference.”
Over the break, Wang visited San Diego, played video games and spent time with his friends, who also could not go back home. 
Faced with limited choices as well, Jessica Kim, a senior majoring in environmental engineering, remained in L.A. While born in South Korea, Kim mainly grew up in Taiwan. Some of her friends with Taiwanese citizenship debated going home, given the necessary arrangements of a two-week quarantine in an approved hotel and the heightened risks of contracting the coronavirus with the rapid spread of the omicron variant. 
However, Kim was barred entry to Taiwan, as the country only allowed entry from citizens and permanent residents. The Korean citizenship that normally granted Kim entry to Taiwan was ineffective following pandemic-related border closures.
“I would have loved to travel, even if there was a chance,” Kim said. “The situation just made the decision for me … It’s been a while since I was able to go home, so going home was my first priority.”
In the weeks prior to the winter break and preceding the spring semester, the USC Office of International Services saw a rise in demand for consultations.
“In addition to the common topics such as maintaining immigration status, and employment eligibility, many students have contacted OIS in the past few weeks with concerns about international travel and how the pandemic may impact their ability to return to the U.S. in time for the spring semester and how that may affect their immigration status,” wrote OIS Assistant Director Anne Goldman in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Students want to know their enrollment options if they contract COVID and cannot travel, if their flights are cancelled or delayed, or if they can’t obtain a COVID test in time to board their plane.”
Hundreds of students each week have continued to obtain advisement on a number of visa and pandemic-related issues from the OIS. Besides live consultations, the OIS provides additional information to visa students through its weekly newsletters.

When Caroline Fromm was deciding which college to attend, one of the things that motivated her to choose USC was the Lyft Safe Rides program. She appreciated that the University cared for the safety of the students to the extent that they were willing to subsidize rides at night. Fromm now has taken more than 150 Lyft rides, all courtesy of the University. 
In a now-reversed policy, students would have had to book individual shared rides instead of individual classic rides, the University announced, along with other changes to the Lyft Safe Rides program policy, in a communitywide email Dec. 3. The University announced the policy would not go into place during the spring semester following a surge in coronavirus cases in a communitywide email Jan. 14. 
Similar to the previous policy, the new Lyft policy required passengers to wear masks during the entire ride. As a new measure, passengers also had to leave the middle and front seats empty during rides. Both riders and drivers were able to cancel the ride without penalty if either party refused to follow the guidelines. 
Looking to stop the new policy’s implementation, Fromm, a sophomore majoring in communication, created a Change.org petition that garnered more than 3,000 signatures. In the petition’s description, Fromm highlighted situations where it might have proven unsafe to separate students who wished to travel together, such as students accompanying someone who is drunk or in an emergency, following a buddy system or avoiding the spread of the coronavirus, especially with surging omicron cases in Los Angeles. 
“When I read the policy, I was shocked. I love this school and I did not think that I would ever be in a position where I had to argue for my safety,” Fromm said. “I felt like I needed to do that when I heard the changes because they inhibit students’ ability to practice very sensible and common safety measures such as the buddy system.”
Martin Aguirre, a freshman majoring in theatre, said he believed the policy modifications only took into consideration the economic aspect of the program and disregarded the health and safety of the students. 
“At least when I’m with my friend group, I know that if someone catches COVID, I will be notified immediately,” Aguirre said. “I’ll get tested and we’ll isolate and do whatever we have to do. But, because this is someone who I don’t know, they could have COVID, and I will never know.”
Aguirre noted that the Fryft program is frequently used by students after parties. Being able to order individual rides let him accompany intoxicated friends to their homes and ensure their safety. Recent sexual assault allegations in the University added a layer of concerns for him.
“All the sexual assault allegations that have been coming to light reinforce the idea that because people go to USC, it doesn’t mean they’re good people,” Aguirre said.
Although students were able to choose to instead pay for individual Lyft rides, Aguirre said it proved expensive, even for short distance rides such as the ones covered by Fryft. 
“Not everyone has the luxury to say, ‘Yeah, I’ll pay $30 for a Lyft from the Row to my dorm.’” Aguirre said. “For [students], it was important in maintaining that equal standard for safety — not if you can afford safety, but, because you go to USC, you are guaranteed safety. Changing the policy starts bringing that inequality and making that inequality an issue where it shouldn’t be, and where the University has the power to not let it be an issue.” 
Sanaa Alam, a freshman majoring in biochemistry, said she believed the policy modification jeopardized students’ safety and took away students’ privileges. 
“It’s really a shame because that means I’m going to have to put myself in more risk in different situations depending on where I go at night,” Alam said in response to the now-reversed policy.
When reached for comment, Lyft Senior Communication Manager Ashley Adams referred the Daily Trojan to USC’s Director of Transportation Tony Mazza. 
“We are continuing to follow guidance from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health actively and monitoring the omicron variant in collaboration with our team of medical experts and county health experts,” Mazza said. “We will continue to make adjustments as necessary to support the health and well-being of our students.” 
Mazza declined to respond to the Daily Trojan’s request for comment about the rationale for the policy change and its potential effects on student safety, including coronavirus exposure and concerns of sexual assault.

Content warning: This article contains references to sexual assault and violence.
The Working Group on Interfraternity Council Culture, Prevention, and Accountability released recommendations to resume Interfraternity Council activities Tuesday, including a phased return to social gatherings, heightened event planning enforcement and greater University oversight over fraternity sexual assault and harassment trainings.
Zukoski announced the working group Nov. 11 after the University suspended IFC social activities due to multiple reports of sexual assault and drugging at fraternities and mass student protests last fall, promising to make recommendations allowing for fraternities’ return, reviewing IFC recognition and “tackling the broader issues of sexual assault and misconduct.” The group was initially expected to deliver recommendations by Dec. 17.
Around two hours before releasing the working group’s recommendations, Senior Vice President of Human Resources Felicia Washington sent a communitywide email regarding Title IX policy changes at USC.
The University also announced four fraternities’ interim suspensions and one’s modified suspension, pending Office for Equity, Equal Opportunity and Title IX investigations. Chi Phi Eta Delta, Delta Tau Delta, Phi Kappa Tau and Sigma Nu are all on interim suspension, and Kappa Sigma is on a modified suspension — meaning that it can hold recruitment but no further social activities — according to the USC Student Affairs website. The Daily Trojan previously reported sexual assault allegations at Sigma Nu, Zeta Beta Tau, Phi Kappa Tau and Chi Phi Eta Delta.
Fraternities not currently under interim suspension, including Kappa Sigma, will begin spring rush Friday with the condition that all events are alcohol-free. If they remain in compliance with University guidelines, a limited number of social events will be permitted as of Feb. 3 before full returns are allowed March 3. 
The University will require all fraternity members to complete USC’s mandatory sexual assault trainings in order for the fraternitites to resume social gatherings. The training is already mandatory for students regardless of IFC involvement, though the University will now ensure fraternity members are compliant in order for social activities to continue. 
The University will continue working with the suspended fraternities to ensure that they complete the same prevention training requirements, said interim Vice President for Student Affairs Monique Allard in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
“To be eligible to even open recruitment, you need to be not on suspension, so those who are currently on suspension are not eligible to open for recruitment,” Allard said. “But we will still be working closely with them to make sure that they’re doing the prevention education and doing all the things that we think are still positive movements forward.”
The IFC Risk Team will expand to include students unaffiliated with IFC, including student leaders and University officials from a variety of departments, such as the Department of Public Safety and Fire Safety & Emergency Planning. The risk team will be required to inspect events to “ensure chapters adhere to event policies,” although Allard said the standards used by the team to inspect events are still being worked out. The risk team will first meet Jan. 31, three days before social activities will be permitted for fraternities in compliance with the guidelines. 
The University will increase security oversight at fraternity parties, requiring security at stairs and hallways leading to bedrooms, and work with IFC to select security vendors for events. Though fraternity parties previously required security, the University plans to “work more closely” with IFC to ensure rules are followed. Chapters are required to pay for security at social events, but the University will communicate with IFC and DPS to look specifically at security companies and safety expectations, Allard said.
The University will also work “much more closely” with IFC to create pre-event plans and post-event risk assessments. While the risk assessments were previously conducted informally, University advisors will now “sit down and comb through them [and] dive into them a little deeper,” Allard said.
Student Affairs will hire a compliance coordinator that will report to the associate vice provost of Student Development and Engagement who will be responsible for overseeing compliance with new guidelines. Though Allard said there is no current timetable on the hire, she hopes it will be “as soon as possible.” The working group will continue meeting throughout the semester to discuss the plan’s details and implementation.
“We’re looking at policy and the conduct code around group responsibility, alcohol policy and so much more,” Allard said. “So there’s a lot of work we’re going to dig into so much deeper in the semester as well.”

After Athletic Director Mike Bohn announced the hire of former-Oklahoma Head Coach Lincoln Riley, the next step in the program’s rebuilding process was putting together an elite coaching staff to surround Riley. 
Over a month after the head coaching hire, USC announced its full coaching staff. Here are the names and their notable contributions to their previous jobs. 
Assistant head coach/outside wide receivers coach: Dennis Simmons
Dennis Simmons will be replacing Keary Colbert as the new wide receivers coach and assistant head coach. In his seven years at Oklahoma under Riley, he coached an elite crop of players including Cowboys wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and Ravens wide receiver Marquise Brown. He was also voted one of the nation’s top 25 recruiters in 2019. 
Simmons’ recruiting skills and playoff experience will be a welcomed addition to the USC coaching staff. 
Offensive coordinator/offensive line coach: Josh Henson
Replacing Graham Harrell as the offensive coordinator will be Josh Henson, the former offensive line coach at Texas A&M. Henson’s 2021 offensive line unit was highly ranked in the nation in pass protection efficiency, finishing 21st in the nation in sack rate. In 2020, the Aggie offensive line was nominated for the Joe Moore Award for the most outstanding offensive line unit in college football. 
While playcalling was previously handled by Harrell, Henson will likely cede the responsibility to Riley, given his experience calling plays at Oklahoma. 
Defensive coordinator: Alex Grinch
Following Riley to USC is Alex Grinch, the former defensive coordinator at Oklahoma. Grinch has experience in the Pac-12, coaching at Washington State from 2015 to 2017 under Mike Leach. Grinch produced five NFL draft picks in his two years at Oklahoma and a Sooner defense that ranked third in the nation.
Defensive backs coach: Donte Williams 
Donte Williams, who served as interim head coach after Clay Helton’s firing, will be retained and will return to his former role as defensive backs coach. Williams is considered one of the best recruiters in the Pac-12, with players like 5-star recruit Domani Jackson citing Williams as the main reason he is coming to USC.
Williams has over a decade of experience as a defensive backs coach, which should serve the Trojans well in the upcoming seasons. 
Outside linebackers coach: Roy Manning
Roy Manning will also follow Riley to USC as the outside linebackers coach. Before his years at Oklahoma, Manning was the special teams coordinator at UCLA, improving their special teams from 65th to 20th in the 2018 season. Manning has experience coaching extremely talented players at OU, including Tre Brown who was drafted to the NFL. Manning also spent three years in the NFL himself, playing for five different teams.
Inside linebackers coach: Brian Odom
Brian Odom has spent the last three years at Oklahoma, becoming one of many pieces of the Trojan staff with experience working under Riley. Odom’s defensive line at Oklahoma ranked 24th nationally in rushing defense in 2021 and fourth in opponent third-down conversion percentage. Along with Grinch, Odom also has experience at Washington State, serving as a quality control assistant. 
Odom will look to use his experience in the Big-12, containing some of the best offenses in college football, to lead the Trojan defensive line. 
Inside wide receivers coach: Dave Nichol  
Dave Nichol spent the last two seasons at Mississippi State, after spending a few years at Washington State with Odom and Grinch. At Mississippi State, Nichol ran the air raid offense — USC’s current main offensive strategy — and served under Mike Leach, who has overseen some of the most successful passing schemes in the country.
Nichol will adopt a Trojan offense that ranked first in the Pac-12 in passing yards despite a 4-8 season. 
Defensive line coach: Shaun Nua  
Shaun Nua adds to the Pac-12 experience of the USC coaching staff as a former defensive line coach at Arizona State. After coaching at Arizona State, Nua spent three years at Michigan. During his tenure, Michigan was ranked 21st nationally in sacks in 2019 and played in the 2021 college football playoffs. 
Nua is known for being very committed to his players but also tough on them when he needs to be. USC’s defensive line will need revamping next season, after losing key pieces such as defensive lineman Nick Figueroa and linebacker Drake Jackson to the NFL Draft. 
Running backs coach: Kiel McDonald  
USC recently hired Kiel McDonald, the former Utah running back coach. During McDonald’s time at Utah, the Utes led the Pac-12 in rushing yards and touchdowns in two of the past three seasons. He also coached Zack Moss, Utah’s all-time leading rusher. 
McDonald is known as an impressive recruiter, adding to an already stacked group of recruiters. 
Tight ends coach: Zach Hanson
Zach Hanson joined the Trojans’ staff in December 2021 as the tight ends coach. In 2019, he was the senior offensive analyst at Oklahoma when they advanced to the playoff semifinal Peach Bowl. Since then, he spent the last two seasons as the offensive line coach at Tulsa. 
At 33 years old, Hanson is the youngest coach on the USC staff.

Since Head Coach Lincoln Riley decided to join USC in November, the Trojans have been in the spotlight, especially for potential high school recruits and transfers. With Riley comes the expectation for success, as seen with his past track record at Oklahoma, which is appealing for many players. He had a record of 55-10 over 5 seasons with the Sooners.
Although many are waiting for the transfer decision of Oklahoma quarterback Caleb Williams, the No. 1 player in the transfer portal who was originally recruited by Riley, here are some of the top recruits confirmed to be representing the Trojans next season. 
Raleek Brown, Running Back, Mater Dei High School
Raleek Brown will offer much needed skill to the running back position after the departures of senior Keaontay Ingram for the NFL Draft and redshirt senior Vavae Malepeai. As one of the best running backs in his class, ranked at No. 2 according to 247Sports, Brown committed to USC and stayed closer to home after originally choosing Oklahoma. 
Due to his speed and play style, the 5-star recruit will work well all around the field on offense. He has the potential as a running back or wide receiver, highlighting his versatility as a playmaker. 
Domani Jackson, Cornerback, Mater Dei High School
To further bolster the secondary, USC swayed 5-star cornerback Domani Jackson away from Alabama to come play for the Trojans. As the No. 1 recruit overall out of California, according to 247Sports, Jackson will pair up well alongside Fabian Ross to strengthen the Trojan defense in the upcoming season. With his speed and ability to cover receivers well, Jackson will be a crucial component to help rebuild USC’s secondary. 
Jackson is also a key piece in USC’s attempt to keep top-recruits in Southern California. His commitment may possibly mark a new era of Southern California stars staying home.  
Mario Williams, Wide Receiver, University of Oklahoma
A former 4-star wide receiver recruit from Florida, Mario Williams stood out during his freshman season at Oklahoma. He had 35 receptions, along with 380 yards and 4 touchdowns. His most notable performance was against Texas Tech, where he earned 100 yards and 1 touchdown with 5 receptions. 
With Mario Williams being one of the newer additions to the Trojans receiving corps and potentially catching passes from his former Oklahoma teammate Caleb Williams, the offense moving forward will be more explosive. 
C.J. Williams, Wide Receiver, Mater Dei High School
A 4-star receiver from the Southern California powerhouse Mater Dei High School, C.J. Williams will add more talent to the Trojans this upcoming season. Williams made his decision while playing in the All-American Bowl with his future teammate, running back Raleek Brown, on Jan. 8 over cross-town rivals UCLA. Originally, Williams had committed to USC’s rival Notre Dame, but decommitted on Dec. 13 soon after Riley was hired. 
In his last season as a senior, he had 51 receptions for 830 yards and 12 touchdowns.
Terrell Bynum, Wide Receiver, University of Washington
Another former 4-star wide receiver transfer, Terell Bynum, is coming back home to Southern California after playing up north in Seattle for Washington the past 4 seasons. During his last year, as a redshirt junior, Bynum had 436 yards and 4 touchdowns on 26 receptions. 
His most notable performance was against Arizona, where he earned 143 yards and 1 touchdown in just 5 receptions, to help the Huskies edge out the Wildcats 21-16. Bynum adds some experience to a receiving corps that will be without last year’s leader Drake London.
Zion Branch, Safety, Bishop Gorman High School
Arriving from Las Vegas, Zion Branch will add more talent to the Trojans’ defense. With offers from other major schools like Ohio State, Oklahoma and Alabama, Branch decided to stay closer to home at USC. 
Ranked as the No. 1 player in Nevada according to 247Sports, Branch is known for his strength and ability to tackle. He had 42 solo tackles senior year and has been compared to Los Angeles Chargers’ Rayshawn Jenkins. Branch’s younger brother, 5-star class of 2023 wide receiver Zachariah Branch has also committed to USC. 
Fabian Ross, Cornerback, Bishop Gorman High School
Like his high school teammate Zion Branch, Fabian Ross will also join the Trojans’ secondary next year. Ross is ranked as the No. 28 ranked cornerback in the nation and has received praise for patience and being able to stick onto the receiver, according to 247Sports. As a participant of the Polynesian Bowl, Ross has been recognized for his talent and will be a key piece in USC’s defense next season.

No. 16 men’s basketball began the season with 13 consecutive wins — its best start since 2017 — but have struggled as of late, losing two of their last three games. Just last week, USC was ranked No. 5 in the AP Poll, the highest the Trojans have been ranked since December 1974. 
The first few weeks of the season were filled with excitement and media buzz for the Trojans. Transfer junior guard Boogie Ellis filled in the role of guard Tahj Eaddy — who declared for the NBA draft last April— but with added show stopping, fast paced offense. Ellis is averaging 12.6 points per game on 43% shooting from the field.
Junior forward Isaiah Mobley continued his production from last season with elite defense and premiere post offense; however, the veteran also has received the green light more often. 
Mobley has attempted 63 threes this season, which already surpasses his season total of 39 attempted last season in 16 more games. At 6-foot-10, he has made 28 of his 63 attempted threes for a 3-point percentage of 44%. 
One of the biggest surprises for the Trojans this season has been the increasing role that redshirt senior Chevez Goodwin has played in the team. Goodwin decided to use his extra year of eligibility to return to USC. 
The forward is second on the team in points per game and is shooting 63% from the field, the highest in a season for USC since the stat started being measured in 1991. Team staff along with Head Coach Andy Enfield made the decision to promote Goodwin to a team captain halfway through the season. 
After the team’s 13th consecutive win to start the season, coronavirus cases within the team forced a pause on games. A three-week hiatus was put into place in which the team had many players test positive, forcing them to stop practicing as well. 
USC lost two of their first three games after returning from the hiatus Jan. 6 and dropped to No. 16 in this week’s AP Poll. 
The first loss of the season came to Stanford in a game where poor free throw shooting set USC up for failure from the first whistle. The Trojans shot 65.6% from the charity stripe.
“We have certain things we do most days in practice that we haven’t been able to do just because of lack of practice,” said Enfield in a press conference after a loss to Oregon. “We need to have hard practices and get back to some of the basic concepts that we were pretty good at before.” 
Although this is the first rough patch of the season, the attitude looking toward the future is bright. Rather than dwell on the losses, the team would rather use them as a way to improve. 
“We kind of need [these losses] to see what it’s like to hit some adversity,” Ellis said. “Adversity helps you get better, so we’re gonna lock in and go into practice. Now we know what we have to work on and get better on. Sometimes when you take some losses, it helps you become better as a team.”
Mobley expressed the same view about looking to the future as his teammate Ellis. He emphasized the team still has a long way to go in the season and they just have to keep going. 
“It’s a long season,” Mobley said. “We’re all here and down, but we’re 14-2. We can’t hang our heads because there’s going to be another good team that we gotta play next week and the week after that.” 
USC will continue its season Thursday against Colorado on the road.

Last week, I wrote the usual installment of my column — “on all things Los Angeles sports.” If you didn’t read it, I forgive you because you’re here now, and that’s all that matters. 
But, if you did read it, well, I messed up, and I’m here to address some things.
See, I wrote that men’s basketball was winning the Pac-12, snapping a drought that’s gone for more than 30 years. What I didn’t know would come next was jinxing to an extensive level. 
When my column published, USC lost to Stanford for its first loss of the season. No big deal, it was bound to happen. The Trojans then bounced back with a strong victory at home against Oregon State. Granted, the Beavers had a lead throughout and USC came back to win, but it’s the win that counts.
Then, Oregon came to Galen Center last Saturday after taking down No. 3 UCLA at Pauley Pavillion two days earlier. The Ducks are always a top team in the Pac-12, no matter who’s on the floor. 
I expected USC to secure another conference victory since Oregon was coming off a tough battle against UCLA. What happened instead was a 40-minute domination by the Ducks against Trojans that were lost. 
The offense stank — in the first half junior forward Isaiah Mobley and junior guard Boogie Ellis combined for 23 of the team’s 29 points. No other Trojan had more than 2 points in the first half, and Ellis had only 4 points in the second half on 2-for-9 shooting. 
I highlighted offensive depth in my column and it’s been there for the most part. The problem is in the half court, USC just looks off. 
The ball gets stuck; players become a little confused and scoring droughts become prominent. Their defense usually carries them past these problems with stops leading to fast break baskets.
But, at least against the Ducks, that offensive inconsistency hurt them in the end. Ellis couldn’t find his shot too, essentially refuting my case that “the Trojans’ depth makes focusing a defense on Ellis a disadvantage for the opponent.”
USC’s excellent defense was another argument included in my previous column.
I specifically wrote: “The length of these players sets up a defense that looks like an octopus with hands in every single passing lane.” 
Solid simile, but oof. At the time of publishing that one, the Trojans held opponents to the third-fewest field goal percentage per game — 35.5%. Since then — oh my God, I need to stop making predictions — all three of USC’s opponents shot over 43%. 
Stanford shot 43.9% from the field, plus 41.7% from beyond the arc in its win. Even though the Trojans beat Oregon State, the Beavers still shot 43.5% from the field and a pretty insane 52.9% from the 3-point line. As you might imagine that percentage from three is substantially higher than their season average — 20% higher to be exact.
And then there was Oregon, who shot a blistering 50% from the field and 47.6% from three last Saturday in an upset. Both figures were above its season averages and higher than the Ducks percentages against UCLA two days earlier.  
Now, look, obviously I was not the cause of these defensive problems with my column. I spent most of those games stuck in quarantine, not on the floor, and God knows I would only make the defense worse. 
However, it seems like lack of practice due to the coronavirus pause hurt some defensive schemes. 
The first few practices back from the pause focused on “skills and drills, just to refresh the players’ muscle memory,” according to the L.A. Times. Head Coach Andy Enfield acknowledged that the Trojans had lost a step on defense because of the pause.
“We need to have hard practices, get back to some of the basic practices that we were pretty good at before,” he said in a post game press conference last Saturday. 
But, it’s not too bad. Much of those field goal percentage increases can be attributed to hot shooting. The opposing 3-point shooting certainly is difficult to continue, since most of those shots are being contested and are statistically unlikely. Enfield seems confident these defensive problems can be fixed.
Even though I do too, if I’ve learned anything, I won’t jump to any conclusions. 
I ended my last column with “USC is winning the Pac-12.” I might have been wrong, but it’s only been a week. A lot of basketball is still left to play. Therefore, I digress and remain confident that the Trojans will figure this out. 
And if they don’t, well. I’ll lay off the predictions for now.

The spring semester’s return to in-person learning has brought forth more changes in students’ return to campus than in previous years. Whether students arrived when USC Housing reopened on Jan. 6, are yet to arrive or fall somewhere in between, here are a list of rules and policies in place for students living in University housing this semester.
No-guest policy
In a Dec. 29 email to USC Housing residents, the University announced that it would be returning to the no-guest policy that was in place at the beginning of the fall semester.
“We know that starting the year without guests can be difficult, but the current policy, in combination with our other mitigation practices, helps provide a safe residential environment for residents to thrive,” said Grant Burlew, senior director of the Office for Residential Education, in a statement to the Daily Trojan.
USC lifted the policy for the Fall on Oct. 18 because of low coronavirus cases on campus. The week of the reversal, the positivity rate among students was 0.12%. The most recent data indicates a positivity rate of 14.79% among students.
Trojan Check
Like last semester, USC Housing residents are required to show a valid Trojan Check pass when entering and exiting their building. The criteria for passing Trojan Check are similar to those from Fall 2021: full vaccination including an influenza shot, a weekly negative test and the completion of a health, hygiene and safety learning module. However, full vaccination now includes a booster shot, proof of which must be uploaded to the MySHR portal by Jan. 31, to ensure campus access.
The University sent an email to students misusing the Trojan Check application on Jan. 13. Misuse includes sharing a campus access pass with another student, using a pass that another student shared or using a guest pass instead of a student pass.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, USC Student Affairs said the University will report students who misuse the system to Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards. After two reports, a student will receive a warning letter from SJACS, with escalating punishments up until five reports, at which SJACS will begin the student conduct process.
“Students likely do not understand they are creating risk by letting their friends ‘borrow’ their Trojan Check, or by using the guest access to get into campus when their own Trojan Check is not in compliance,” USC Student Affairs wrote. “We focus on education and making students aware that the tool is designed to track compliance and keep the community safe, and that by allowing people who may not be compliant into campus, they are exposing the community to a greater risk for COVID-19 transmission.”
Testing
All students are required to show a negative coronavirus test result upon their return to University housing. USC Student Health recommends that students test 48 hours before leaving their winter break location to return to campus. Lab PCR tests and at-home tests are acceptable. For students who tested positive in the last 90 days, USC Housing will also accept a positive result from that time period. Students should upload their test result to mySHR and email it to their respective Customer Service Center.
USC Housing has also begun notifying residents via email when a resident in their building tests positive, along with their infectious period and a link to post-exposure instructions from USC Student Health.
Masking
In a Jan. 5 communitywide email, the University announced that students are required to wear medical grade masks, including surgical, N95, KN95 and KF94 masks, and can no longer wear cloth masks unless they wear a surgical mask underneath. This requirement extends to common and public areas of University housing buildings.
Deadline to move in
Prior to the University’s announcement of online learning, the deadline for students to move into dorm-style housing upon their return from winter break was Jan. 10. The deadline is now Jan. 24, and will be moved according to the start date of in-person classes.
“All spring Housing assignments will be active and held for students while university classes are being held remotely,” the Dec. 29 email read.

Lauryn Jones recalls her experience going to Leavey Library as one of being treated with an exasperated indifference.
“They really act like you are such a burden for walking into a library that is literally for you,” said the senior majoring in English, letting out a big sigh to imitate the stoic passiveness she received stepping into the library.
She felt this experience in most of the libraries she strolled into on and off-campus — then came Noname’s Radical Hood Library.
“If you’re passing by, they’re like, ‘Hey do you wanna come in? It’s a new library. Come check it out. We have some candy … We have some free bookmarks if you wanna come in,’”Jones said. “They just want you to be there.”
The Radical Hood Library, also known as Book Club Headquarters, is a vibrant community space and literary initiative about 10 minutes from USC’s campus along Jefferson Blvd. Its conception is the brainchild of Fatimah Warner, most commonly known as the revered Chicago rapper and wordsmith Noname. 
The space contradicts the common notions of what one might expect of a library. Instead of the quiet stillness that many students are accustomed to, you can hear avid chattering from Noname Book Club meetings and the echo of documentary screenings in the open space on some nights. There are also no overdue fees if one happens to hold on to a book for too long.
What’s most remarkable, however, are the titles one sees upon stepping into the bright interior illuminated by the Los Angeles sun. Instead of combing through the Dewey Decimal system, you can pick up Angela Davis’ “Are Prison Obsolete?” from the prison-abolition section or flip through ideological musings from the renowned West Indian social philosopher Frantz Fanon.
From books on labor unions to graphic novels mapping the history of the Black Panthers, the library is a hub for radical, socialist, queer and Black and brown literature that might be banned or left out from public libraries and school curriculums.
After Angelique Prater, a sophomore majoring in Latin studies, learned the Library was just 10 minutes away, she and her roommate rushed to visit it. The space was perfect for Prater, who felt more connected to the South Central community members than with her mostly white, affluent peers, especially as someone of Latinx and Indigenous descent.
“Having the Radical Hood Library in a traditionally underserved Black community in conjunction with the fact that they also help people who are incarcerated, it allows the ideology of communism, socialism, anti-police, anti-capitalism to be something that underserved communities can learn a lot more about so that they can actually feel like they resonate with it,” Prater said.
Warner founded the Radical Hood Library in October 2021 as a headquarters to further develop Noname’s Book Club, where she chooses a book by BIPOC authors every month for thousands of chapter members to read and discuss across the country, in-person or online. It was also another step in furthering her Prison Chapter project, which sends books from the Book Club to incarcerated people throughout the country.
Jones took the opportunity to participate in the physical book club at the library after following Noname’s work for a few years on social media.
“It prioritizes Black and brown people,” Jones said. “We’re all entering the Library, knowing that we have more to learn and we just want to be there and enjoy this space.”
The space became an intellectual playground outside of the brick-and-mortar institution of USC where she spent most of her time studying and feeling tokenized.
Jones felt this alienation in many of her classes. She recalls how in her American literature class, the Black literature portion was reduced to just Frederick Douglass’ autobiography and Martin Luther King’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail”.
But at the Radical Hood Library, this Black and brown presence is exalted. She saw people of color be pushed to the forefront.
As someone who grew up in rural Texas with Noname’s smooth, poignant lyricism constantly in the background, Jones was initially mesmerized by Warner’s presence in the Library. 
While there was a bit of fanfare from seeing an adored musician in front of her (along with regulars like actress Quinta Brunson and artist Earl Sweatshirt), the limelight soon dissolved for Lauryn, who saw Warner maneuvering throughout the space with calm ease and even introspection. 
A lack of hierarchy cultivated a climate where individuals could speak freely and disagree with each other, all in the name of collective growth.
“Noname, at least I’ve noticed, has no issue with you trying to speak your mind. Even if it’s completely against what she thinks. She’s just like, ‘Cool. If you want to read some more, here’s my library. I’ll give you a library card,’” Jones said.
To Jones, the space prioritizes the stumbling and awkwardness that comes with wandering into the learning process. In an era of social media call-outs and slip-ups, the library distinguishes itself as a space to intellectually challenge systems and thought processes that individuals might have been conditioned into.
While it’s been a space of intellectual growth, Cortaney Martin-Jones, a junior majoring in creative writing, was also enthralled by the material good the library was creating in the community.
The library defied her prior experiences with libraries as a low-income child in Georgia, where she was often barred from reading books due to overdue fees she simply couldn’t afford to pay. It was among the library’s abolitionist and mutual aid texts that she saw literature materialize into community action. Whether it was through Narcan training or the Prison Chapters, which connects prisoners with radical texts, Martin-Jones admired the tangible change being created.
“I got some training with Narcan and now I carry Narcan around with me everywhere … They’re also doing a lot of things that will tangibly and materially impact people’s lives and save lives,” Martin-Jones said. “And it’s just nice to see a type of education that isn’t just based in theory.” 
It’s amid this conversation of altering conditions for marginalized people that Martin-Jones called back to a Twitter dispute she was in, where she responded to criticisms that a library could not make a substantial change for an underserved community like South Central.
“I understood where they were coming from, but as someone who has been poor — I grew up unhoused and things like that — having public libraries was probably one of the biggest sanctuaries for me as a child,” Martin-Jones said. “It did so much for me to just have a place to go, to read and to be in a community space, to watch movies, different things that libraries put on.”
It’s in this space that Black and brown joy inadvertently becomes radical, even if that revolution may reverberate just through annotated pages, lush plants or simply existing in a temporal moment of peace.
“I research Black joy, just like generally, but [also] specifically in the American literary canon,” said Jones. “So I think that Noname’s Book Club is a really cool place to experience Black joy and to think about Black joy as something that isn’t resistance or rebellion against [or] structured around white supremacy, it’s Black joy for the sake of Black joy, and we all happen to be resisting.”
At the grand opening in early October, the Black joy that Jones speaks of radiated off Jefferson Blvd. Community members shuffled and danced on the concrete pad adjacent to the Library as music pulsed in the background and the tangy spices of vegan Caribbean food wafted in the chilly afternoon air. 
It’s this Black joy which blossoms from the Library that can become a vibrant repose for USC students, like Jones, who carry the uncomfortable weight of reductive curriculums and insensitive students and professors. 
It’s in this environment of peace and unity that these different community members can find common ground towards more tangible goals for the future. This first step towards that common ground is punctuated by a single question Warner asks at Book Club meetings: “What does liberation mean to you?”
“And she asks people across the diaspora. Michael is Caribbean; I’m Black American; I’m from the South; she’s from Chicago; there are Indigenous people at the book club, there are Hispanic people in the book club. So what [does] that mean to them?” said Jones. ”And how can America achieve all, if not almost all of these goals for all these different communities? Is that even possible?”
Even if you may not be able to respond to the question yet, you’re always welcome to flip through the crisp book pages inside the bright blue sanctuary on Jefferson Blvd. And maybe in this space, you might find the answer.

In an attempt to exert the little control I have over the world, I decided to clean my childhood bedroom over winter break. If we have been in Zoom meetings together at any point, this room likely left an impact on you. In fact, I have had people on campus come up to me and say, “You’re Rachel with the blue room, right?” The room’s walls are a Powerade teal that I chose when I was 10, decorated with a too-large bookshelf and travel prints and it’s small — typical in Los Angeles. As I was sorting through my stack of mass-market paperbacks in said blue room, trying not to think about the state of the world, I found a yellow tome. 
“Tome” might be an exaggeration, but it was a relatively comprehensive collection of “Curious George” stories, all printed in the mid-’90s. I was struck by how much I remembered as I leafed through the pages, debating if I should donate it. It was like the stories had been taking up the space in my brain which might have been better used on my finals last semester. It’s bizarre how a story can stick with you, no matter how long ago you read it, and how it can be a comfort. If you were to quiz me on some of the lines from any of the books I read as a kid, I’d probably remember them. I could be a “Geronimo Stilton” encyclopedia. 
Life right now is scary (even beyond the usual stressors) and uncertainty reigns. Maybe that was why I felt a sort of contentment wash over me when I remembered those storylines and illustrations. Maybe this is an instance of old events coming back en vogue, à la Bennifer. I’m now used to seeing the small sunglasses and velour pants reminiscent of the once-ubiquitous Juicy tracksuit as I walk around town and campus. If it weren’t for the pandemic and the fact that “Fearless” and “Red” have been re-recorded to become Taylor’s versions, I would think that I was back in a world where “Single Ladies” was the number one song. So, if the world is scary, look to old comforts; I have some in mind. 
First, let’s talk “Percy Jackson” — I’ve never read “Harry Potter,” save your shock — but I adored the “Percy Jackson and the Olympians” series. Percy and I were besties. I remember saving all of the old-fashioned Tumblr-style memes from vintage Instagram fan accounts to my camera roll — is this exposing myself too much? Anyway, that’s all to say that the stories are still aging like fine wine and are as endearing as they were when you first read them. The books don’t take themselves too seriously, and Riordan knows where his strengths lie. It is likely because of his skills that the original five-novel series ballooned to twice that length with a spinoff series “Heroes of Olympus” (Bonus points to you if you read it). 
The feat of creating a fleshed-out series with 3D characters that withstand the test of time is commendable, resulting in the story’s very well-received Broadway musical adaptation and television show currently in development— not to mention that the characters have been featured in films that the fanbase chooses to ignore. The dialogue is masterful, witty and voice-filled, and I’d bet that even today, you’d remember the individual personalities of Annabeth, Percy and Grover. I found my much-adored “Percy Jackson” series as I went through my bookshelves. My original copy of the series — that I have now carried with me for 10 years — is well-loved and dog-eared, especially on the pages where 12-year-old me found a line that she liked. And, of course, you better believe that I picked up the anniversary edition. I made sure it is prominently displayed on the favorites section of my shelf. 
Back in the olden days, at the same time as I had exhausted the Riordan-verse, I happened upon the renaissance of young adult literature, and it promptly overtook my brain. We rarely talk about just how lucky the 2012-era cohort of young adult readers was with this barrage of dystopian novels. The main thing on my mind is the “Hunger Games” series. I remember passing magazine stands and seeing the collector’s edition magazines advertising a dark-haired Jennifer Lawrence (before the Oscars fall) and a pre-marriage Liam Hemsworth. 
Being the good reader that I am, I devoured the entire book before I saw the film in theaters. In a marathon reading session in the aforementioned blue room, I finished the novel in a single day. I recently reread the book (rewatching the film is also on my list), and I was surprised at how much I remembered. I was suddenly struck by the memory of dressing up as Katniss Everdeen for the holiday of Purim. I remembered donning a black rain jacket and attaching a Mockingjay pin to it. I did the signature single braid, and I felt like the coolest kid out there (for reference on how cool it seems in hindsight, no one will ever see the photographs. I’ve exposed myself enough in this column). I was equally surprised to revisit the careful annotations of iconic lines done by my 12-year-old self. 
This is a more maudlin column than I planned on writing. Maybe it’s the startling realization that it is my final semester before I graduate from USC, or perhaps the nostalgia from sorting through decades of books got to me. Nevertheless, I think that we could all use a bit of comfort right now, and maybe it’s worth imagining that this is your A24 coming-of-age film realization moment — such as the time when Lady Bird calls her mom, or when Rachel Bernstein goes through the books of her childhood bedroom — still her bedroom today because she’s a commuter (very A24). Get a little bit maudlin, you’ve earned it!

USC Village lies at the center of fond memories for almost every USC student. Maybe you had a perfect first date at Dulce, scored your summer internship while waiting in line for CAVA, or participated in a group study session outside of SunLife that their açaí bowls made a little better. All of these memories have something in common: good food. Although you’re likely to have a good experience at any of USC Village eateries, here are my expert picks for every occasion. 
A Light Lunch: CAVA
Lunch is a criminally underrated meal, and it’s essential in college. While you’re running from class to class, it might be tempting to skip it, but that’s a bad idea. If you’re near USC Village and have time to stop by, consider CAVA your lunch of choice. Keeping your lunches meatless and stacked with veggies is a great way to ensure a nutrient-dense meal. With excellent vegetarian options and plenty of vegetable add ons, CAVA is the best place to create the perfect on-the-go lunch. After eating, you’ll leave USC Village for your afternoon class feeling like you did your body a favor. 
Friday Night Chaos: City Tacos
On a Friday night filled with loud laughter and risky text messages, there’s only one option in USC Village that will get the job done: City Tacos. There’s nothing like biting into a hot delicious taco after a long week and eventful night. City Tacos has a dense menu packed with mouth-watering taco options: chicken, fish, beef, vegetables and more. Their burritos and quesadillas pack a flavorful punch too. Get a side of guacamole and chips to share with your friends and you’ll end the night on a high. Don’t forget that City Tacos closes at 9 p.m., so make sure to plan ahead and get in early so you do not miss out on an incredible dinner.
Post-Gym Monday Morning: SunLife Organics  
Monday mornings are easy to dread, but it’s also surprisingly easy to make the most out of them. First, hit the gym with your friends, making sure to laugh just as much as you squat — CorePower Yoga and the USC Village Fitness Center are two hotspots for both USC athletes and casual gym-goers. After you’ve worked up a sweat, head over to SunLife for a morning breakfast smoothie or açaí bowl packed with fresh fruit, protein and sweet toppings. Their beloved Hawaiian Bowl will make you feel like your Monday morning is kicking off a vacation, rather than the school week. Eat it outside and soak up some year-round California sun before spending the day in class or the library. After trying this once, you’ll make it a weekly tradition. 
Wednesday Night Slump: Il Giardino 
By midweek Wednesday night, your morale might be understandably low. Assignments are starting to pile up and Friday night seems years away. At this point, there’s only one remedy to pick up your spirits: pasta. Carbs are a miracle worker, and Il Giardino does not disappoint. Its pasta selections will make you feel warm and cozy before you’ve got to hit the books. With a menu that includes homemade gnocchi and vegan bolognese, you can’t go wrong. Invite your friends to commiserate on your long to-do lists over a delicious bowl of tagliatelle, and when the bowl is empty, order the tiramisu to sweeten the night. 
Homestyle Family Dinner: Honeybird
When the sun goes down, and everyone’s home from work or school, there’s nothing like a loud dinner with your family in your hometown. So, when you’re feeling homesick and miss those meals, gather your closest friends and create some of that magic for yourselves on campus. Opt for Honeybird as your dinner spot. If you make sure to pick waffle fries and biscuits as your sides, along with an array of fried chicken, that homesick feeling will drift away as soon as you take your first bites. After all, what’s more homey than a fried chicken dinner? 
College can be messy, exciting and stressful, but USC Village provides excellent spots to fix any situation. At least, that’s what I tell myself when my eating out bill gets a little high. So visit these spots or add them to your list of delicious USC Village eats that act as a culinary treatment plan for all of college’s bruises, burns and cuts.

In early December, a series of tornadoes tore through parts of western Kentucky, leveling buildings and leaving Graves County and the county of Mayfield in ruins. As it crossed through multiple states, it left 78 people dead and more missing in Kentucky alone. 
The tornadoes terrorized eight states in the Central and Southern United States and raised alarms far before the twisters ever touched the ground. Employees at the Mayfield Consumer Products factory in Kentucky reported hearing extreme weather warning sirens as the tornado approached their town. Many workers urged their managers to let them go home to take cover in preparation for the storm to pass. According to many of the employees, their requests were denied. 
The tornado completely leveled the factory, leaving nine dead. Those who managed to survive narrowly escaped death by flying rubble and chemicals; however, they didn’t make it out unscathed. McKayla Emery, a 21-year-old employee of the Mayfield Consumer Products factory, was trapped for six hours under a cement wall with chemical burns on various places on her body. 
Unfortunately, neglectful management was not unique to the Mayfield Consumer Products factory during December’s series of twisters. Around the same time in Illinois, an EF-3 tornado caused major structural damage to an Amazon warehouse, leaving six people dead and at least one injured. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration announced that it opened an investigation into the causes of the warehouse collapse, which raises questions as to whether federal officials have reason to believe that the Amazon warehouse wasn’t up to code. 
While the surrounding neighborhoods that were able to take shelter had minor damage, the indifference to the welfare of the factory’s employees came at the cost of their workers’ lives. 
Even if OSHA found that the building wasn’t up to code, there isn’t much preventing flimsy deathtraps from being built up again. According to The Washington Post, there are no federal requirements for warehouse shelters specially built to withstand extreme storms. There’s nothing preventing Amazon and Mayfield Consumer Products from putting poorly made warehouses and factories back up. Frankly, there’s nothing stopping them from contributing to the climate crisis that causes the same extreme weather events that leveled their buildings and left their employees dead. 
It doesn’t take a pessimist to realize that tragedies like these will continue to happen unless clear, enforceable regulations are put in place. To corporate giants like Amazon who are already hellbent on squashing unionization attempts, it wouldn’t be far-fetched to assume that workers and buildings are all expendable. So as long as they can hold the prospect of more pay or the termination of a job over the heads of their employees, these companies continue to get away with their half-hearted attempts to promote worker safety. 
The tragedies caused by the December tornadoes can’t only be blamed on the inaction and neglect of Amazon and the Mayfield Consumer Products company. The federal government has the responsibility to hold these companies accountable for neglecting employee safety and producing the waste that contributes to the climate crisis. 
Workers, especially those in the South, shouldn’t be forced to choose between making ends meet or being injured or killed in an ecological catastrophe. In failing to equip agencies, like OSHA, with more power to enforce safety standards, the federal government essentially washes its hands of any duty to protect working-class people from predatory and neglectful labor practices. 
The coronavirus pandemic has made working-class folks realize that they should never be forced to choose between death and barely livable wages. Collective action on the worker front is powerful, but without adequate federal regulations in place to hold workplaces accountable for employee safety, what happened in Kentucky and Illinois will happen again.

I am all for the advocacy that a single Change.org petition can invoke. Go ahead, call me an advocacy advocate because every other insult geared toward my leftist, outspoken, collegiate writer status will probably not sting as much as “social justice warrior.” After all, what’s better than a centralized petitioning network that can set signature goals and allow users to share worthy causes across social media platforms? 
I can tell you about many things better than a certain petition that surfaced on Change.org last month. The petition, entitled “Keep classes in-person at USC for the mental health of the students,” may be the most egregious piece of writing I have read in a hot minute — which says a lot, considering I binged the entire “Fifty Shades of Grey” series during quarantine. 
A hodgepodge of cherry-picked psychology.com statistics and half-baked arguments for worker’s rights, the petition garnered widespread attention and nearly 3,000 signatures from students. It also contained offensive comments about Indigenous communities — “Anthropologists always remark at the lack of mental health issues within intact indigenous tribes. This is because they have community! They play, hunt, dance, sleep and love together.” 
I aired my grievances with the petition on Instagram — everyone’s favorite place to suddenly become an infectious diseases expert — and I will take my stance to the grave: People’s disabilities do not exist for college students to write Change.org petitions in the hopes that their university will allow them to party again. It is not only ableist, but it is also myopic. Isolation and online classes because of the coronavirus are not the only things causing stress and exacerbating mental illness. For instance, it is also depressing to have incompetent political parties, wretched working conditions and dying family members and friends.
Although it came from students, the petition merely highlights one facet of ableist thinking at USC. Perhaps it is a mere byproduct of the administration’s disheartening trend of enabling entitled ideology. According to an email obtained by the Daily Trojan on Jan. 4, Campus Support & Intervention under the Office of Student Accessibility Services encouraged students requesting hybrid or online course options to take a leave of absence. 
In other words, students who do not feel comfortable returning to class for in-person instruction — including immunocompromised students and others with disabilities — must choose between risking their health to take classes in person or pausing their studies. By not allowing disabled students the same opportunity as other students and appropriate accommodations, USC promotes all-too-familiar rhetoric that condones eugenics. 
Eugenics is the unethical and denounced scientific study that seeks to establish selective breeding to reproduce “suitable” races and eradicate “undesirable” traits. In fact, former USC President Rufus von KleinSmid supported eugenics — hence, it only took the University more than 50 years to remove his name from a building.
During the pandemic, eugenicist thinking surfaced among opponents of coronavirus safety regulations. Instead of masking up, they said, “Less than 1% of us will die from it, so what?” Instead of isolating, they contemplated, “Perhaps this is God’s way of weeding out the weakest of the bunch.” Pop culture continues to gloss over the word “eugenics” whenever another politician takes a staunch stand against masking up during Congress, but we must call it as it is: Refusing to protect the most vulnerable people in your community not only makes you a self-centered coronavirus denier but also a proponent of eugenics. 
By not appropriately accommodating students during a pandemic, USC follows this same thought process. Disabled students should not have to sacrifice their education for their safety. We deserve the same opportunities as students without disabilities, and the University’s inaction speaks volumes about its lack of regard for its populations most vulnerable to the pandemic. 
USC is not alone, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also not shied away from projecting eugenicist philosophy. In a Good Morning America interview earlier this month, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky remarked that recent data shows 75% of coronavirus-related deaths happen in people who have at least four other comorbidities, which is “really encouraging news.” 
The CDC’s list of comorbidities includes cancer, diabetes, HIV, obesity and mental health conditions such as depression and schizophrenia. Following the backlash, which included an open letter from the Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund, Dr. Walensky tweeted in support of people with disabilities. However, her interview rhetoric still devalues disabled people’s lives as disposable and insignificant. 
As someone with a mood disorder and whom the CDC also considers at high-risk of severe illness from the coronavirus, I implore our institutions — the CDC, USC and beyond — to understand not only the damage their language causes but also the damage their inaction perpetuates. By not providing support for disabled students beyond a leave of absence recommendation, what kind of inclusivity standard is USC establishing? 
Does USC only seek to support able-bodied students, or does it equivocally support all of us? Will it condone its culture of ableism, or will USC seek to stop it by actually increasing disabled student visibility and access to resources? Will USC allow its students to risk their lives for an education — or will it set a precedent against its past and culture, once and for all?

A troubling trend has emerged that threatens the value of law and medical students’ university degrees: unverified TikTok “advice.” 
The social media platform has emboldened a high volume of lawyers and medical experts, or those claiming to be, to join and post videos. A blog targeted toward lawyers, Justia Onward, even encourages lawyers to sign up for TikTok, calling it “A New Place for You to Grow Your Practice.” The blog additionally provides examples of lawyers on the platform who have earned thousands of followers from content creation. 
Growing one’s legal practice without paying for advertisements seems perfect at first glance, and it is not surprising that many lawyers would turn to TikTok to gain notoriety. However, as explored by the University of Cincinnati Law Review, this movement presents real risks to TikTok. 
A lawyer who makes comedy-based content may send the wrong impression about the legal world and the responsibilities that accompany the career. It becomes difficult to trust a lawyer when they turn to a social media platform to make short, humorous videos about their practice and, ultimately, lose a sense of professionalism and authority. Because TikTok allows anyone to join the platform, anyone can claim to be an attorney without verification. This gives users free rein to spread misinformation and affect the younger generation’s perception of an entire profession. 
The same is true for medical professionals who join the app. Becoming a doctor is an arduous process and requires extensive training and knowledge; yet, anyone can type “Dr.” in their TikTok profile and give “medical” advice or information. 
This creates a difficult job for actual medical professionals such as Savannah Sparks, whose TikTok content mainly comprises of correcting false claims. Encountering videos with false information on a daily basis, Sparks once had to correct the dangerous claims that a supplement could treat ADHD. As videos encouraging the use of falsified vaccination cards spread across the app, Sparks addressed the conspicuous dangers of doing so. Despite her attempts to correct misinformation, Sparks has faced online harassment and has even had her videos removed. TikTok claims it “prohibits misinformation that ‘can cause harm to an individual’s physical health,’” and, yet, videos of harmful advice persist on the app.
TikTok has a unique aspect that allows misinformation to spread: its audio feature. Audios have triggered the spread of misinformation on vaccines, creating an obstacle to both public health and the authority of actual medical professionals throughout the pandemic. When citizens have access to so much misinformation, it makes it more difficult for public health professionals to form a unifying and cohesive message. Rolling Stone describes such videos as people dancing to trending audios while spreading misinformation on coronavirus’ death toll or danger. Users can be seen dancing to Megan Thee Stallion while words on the screen perpetuate coronavirus conspiracies such as, “‘Bill Gates wants to chip us, track us and vax us / can’t convince us he’s not an assassin.’”
While other social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook spoke with lawmakers in the UK about fighting misinformation, TikTok did not participate, as it is not perceived as an app that disseminates serious information. The reality is that TikTok plays a vital role in spreading information to its young audience.
In a country where postgraduate degrees have a minimal effect on employment, TikTok lawyers and doctors are possibly threatening the depreciation of these degrees even more. If anyone can turn to a social media app to give legal or medical advice, regardless of its veracity, then users may no longer feel as strong of a need to visit a doctor or get legal counseling. 
The coronavirus pandemic came at a time where social media is the norm. As described by the American Medical Association: “While more than two-thirds of Americans get their news from at least one social media outlet, that information does not go through the same vetting process as is done by professional news organizations.” 
Doctors shared their concerns about the role of social media in public health during an AMA Special Meeting in June 2021, describing that, in a time when 25% of YouTube videos about the coronavirus are riddled with misinformation, they have had to correct false medical claims with their patients. 
While social media platforms can feel like an escape from reality, their consequences on the real world are grave.
