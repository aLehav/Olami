At a state Medical Board hearing on Tuesday, former Keck School of Medicine vice dean Henri Ford testified that he suspected Carmen Puliafito for possible drug usage during his deanship at the Keck school. Prior to Puliafito’s resignation, Ford addressed his concerns and reported them to the a senioradministrator at the University.
In early 2016, Ford, now dean of University of Miami’s medical school, notified USC Provost Michael Quick about Puliafito attending parties with people of “questionable reputation.” According to Ford, he made the decision to contact the administration to express his concerns for Puliafito’s mental health and overall well-being.
According to the Los Angeles Times, Ford’s testimony was the first to indicate that people within the USC administration had suspected Puliafito for using drugs while serving as the dean. 
Puliafito announced his resignation in March 2016 after serving as dean since 2007. In his letter to the USC community, Puliafito said he planned on returning to work in academic ophthalmology and wanted to pursue other identified opportunities in healthcare. 
In July 2017, a Times investigation reported that Puliafito used illegal drugs, hosted in-office parties and kept in contact with criminals and other drug users during his time at USC. 
Several weeks prior to Puliafito’s resignation, it was also revealed that he was present when 21-year-old Sarah Warren suffered a drug overdose at a party at a Pasadena hotel. 
Puliafito accused Warren of introducing him to methamphetamine at the medical board hearing, which he testified to using with her once a week, according to the LA Times. He also denied Warren’s claim that he provided her with drugs, which she had told the Medical Board and the LA Times. 
Warren did not testify before the medical board Tuesday, but the judge is still considering previous statements by Warren and her brother.
At the hearing, Ford testified that he first reported Puliafito to Quick because of his behavior a conference in Las Vegas. The dean did not show up because he was “partying” in his hotel room. Quick agreed to follow up but did not, Ford said. 
Ford said he resigned as vice dean after seeing that the University did not require Puliafito to seek treatment and was instead told by administrators they had lost confidence in him.
Former federal prosecutor Debra Yang and her firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher are currently conducting an inquiry into Puliafito’s case.

Alumna and Jamison Realty CEO Jaime Lee has been elected to the Board of Trustees, the University announced on May 31. 
While running her real estate firm in Los Angeles, Lee served as a Provost member of USC Associates and lectured at the Gould School of Law, Price School of Public Policy and Marshall School of Business. 
“Jaime Lee is an extraordinarily dedicated member of the Trojan Family who has generously given her leadership skills and expertise to so many USC events and initiatives,” USC President C.L. Max Nikias said to USC News. 
Lee is the immediate past president of the USC Alumni Association Board of Governors, and was the youngest and first Asian woman to be elected to the position.
“When you love an institution so much, to be a significant part of advancing its mission and goals is a tremendous honor,” Lee said in the press release. “All of the alumni who give back do it because we love USC.”e
Beyond her involvement at USC, the real estate executive also volunteers with different organizations such as the California Film Commission, Town Hall Los Angeles, the Anderson Munger Family YMCA and the Harvard-Westlake Korean American Alumni Network. 
Lee was also recently appointed by Mayor Eric Garcetti as the president of the Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners, where she will manage the Port of Los Angeles. 
Lee graduated with a bachelor’s degree in English from the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences in 2006 and completed her law degree from the Gould School of Law in 2009.
According to USC News, Lee hopes to continue improving outreach to young alumni and promoting diversity and inclusion as a trustee. 
“Her enthusiasm and passion for the university, as well as her exceptional talents in the business world and in real estate, will be an invaluable addition to the board,” Nikias said.

Former USC cornerback Jack Jones was arrested by Ventura County Police Friday on two felony charges — commercial burglary and conspiracy to commit a crime — after police say he attempted to break into a Santa Paulo Panda Express at 3 a.m. He was booked in the Ventura County Jail with a bail of $20,000. Jones is scheduled to appear in Ventura County Superior Court Tuesday afternoon.
The arrest comes after Jones was declared academically ineligible for the 2018 season following spring camp. Jones sat out of camp to focus on his studies but failed to meet the mark. 
Last Tuesday, he confirmed to the Los Angeles Times that he would leave USC to take courses at a junior college in attempt to regain his eligibility for 2019. 
Jones was considered a defensive asset for the Trojans in the 2017 season. He touted 40 tackles and a team-best four interceptions in the 14 games he played. Jones was expected to remain the starting cornerback for the upcoming 2018 season prior to his dismissal.
Jones was rated the No. 10 cornerback in the 2016 recruiting class by ESPN. 
Jones’ dismissal was a significant loss to the USC defense, which retained a solid group of starters from the 2017 season.
