Have you ever encountered the question “what do you want to become?” at some point in your life? It is not a usual answer, but Henry Parker-Elder, a junior majoring in theater and cinema and media studies, wanted to become a wall.  
Elder began sitting in the corner against the wall on the second floor of the Physical Education Building Monday afternoon as a performance art project for his class, “Theater on the Edge.” The class discusses performance in its various forms. 
“PED currently is the home of the School of Dramatic Arts … so to become part of the wall, I’m implying that the building itself is the stage,” Elder said. 
As a creative response to a class assignment — the concept of Bauhaus — which contains the idea that the stage is not the complete performance space, Elder decided to embody a wall to reflect the concept’s idea about taking something human and making it into something non-human. 
Elder has been sitting in the spot for more than 24 hours with help from his friends to receive necessities like food, blankets and toilet paper. 
“I feel very zen, which is a weird feeling that I wouldn’t expect to feel, but something about sitting on the floor and being in this space and just kind of existing with all the ambiance … a lot of it has been kind of meditative for me,” Elder said.
Elder’s performance art project will end either when he “becomes the wall” or Wednesday afternoon at two.

**This review contains spoilers for the first season of “House of the Dragon.”
The Targaryens are back and their lives are just as sordid, messy and convoluted as ever. The long-awaited finale to “House of the Dragon,” a spin-off that picks up generations before the start of the hit HBO series “Game of Thrones,” released Sunday.
“The Black Queen” is a satisfying conclusion to an absolute whirlwind of a debut season filled with beheadings, twists and turns galore. And, as per usual, what stands out about this entry in the “Game of Thrones” universe is the formidable characters at its center. 
Emma D’Arcy had quite the task in front of them portraying Queen Rhaenyra — or Princess depending on which side you’re on — as she copes with the death of her father, the contest of her claim to the Iron Throne, the stillborn birth of her and Daemon’s child and the death of her dear son Lucerys all in one episode. D’Arcy faces this challenge seemingly effortlessly as they take Rhaenyra through the full spectrum of human emotion, juggling grief, apprehension and rage in the episode’s 59-minute runtime. Many shows struggle to create developed, well-rounded characters, especially in as little as ten episodes, but with Rhaenyra, the first season of “House of the Dragon” succeeded in creating a character whose motivations and relationships are made abundantly clear to viewers. 
For those familiar with “Game of Thrones,” Rhaenyra is a more than worthy successor to the formidable and iconic Daenerys Targaryen as one of the most rational and likable characters to grace the screen this year. D’Arcy portrays Rhaenyra with such poise and benevolence that it’s almost impossible to doubt the actions she’s taken — barring her relationship with her uncle, Daemon, but if you’re familiar with “Game of Thrones” in any capacity you’ll know incest is, unfortunately, par for the course. 
In this episode, Rhaenyra is yet again faced with impossible circumstances and important decisions. Even in the face of her childhood best friend Alicent Hightower trying to steal the Iron Throne out from under her, she demonstrates restraint and understanding. While the other characters at the war council advocate for violence and immediate action, Rhaenyra is measured and tries to decide what is best for the realm at large, even at the expense of her claim to the throne — at least at first.
Rhaenyra’s patience is finally tested after she sends her son Lucerys out on a diplomatic mission to appeal to the House of Baratheon as allies and supporters of her claim to the throne. Lucerys arrives only to find that King Viserys and Alicent’s son Aemond — a character so vile and unlikable it pains me even to type out his name — is also there and has already successfully appealed to the Baratheon house and secured their support for Aegon as the rightful King. Their conflict ultimately results in an epic battle of dragons in the sky as Aemond’s mammoth of a dragon, Vhaghar, chases Lucerys down and – against the instructions of Aemond – eats Lucerys and his dragon Arrax clean in two. The look of shock on Aemond’s face surely matched my own as we both realized this would mark the true start of the Targaryen civil war, the dance of the dragons.
It is upon receiving this news, and only then, that Rhaenyra’s composure almost breaks. The episode concludes with Rhaenyra staring directly into the viewer’s eyes. Her eyes say it all: the second season of “House of the Dragon” will see Rhaenyra raise hell and dragon fire.
“The Black Queen” concludes the season and sets up the conflict which will serve as the primary subject of the next season perfectly. The first season had a lot to address, and somehow they managed to execute it all; building a new world situated in the “Game of Thrones” universe that is somehow distinctly its own. At the same time, “House of the Dragon,” amidst time jumps and a massive slate of characters necessary to provide exposition key to understanding the story, manages to develop the tension between the Greens, supporters of Viserys and Alicent’s son Aegon’s claim to the throne, and Blacks, supporters of Rhaenyra’s claim. 
“The Black Queen” comes on the heels of “The Green Council,” an episode that focused exclusively on Alicent’s answer to Viserys’ death and her misunderstanding of the Song of Ice and Fire prophecy that started her attempts to install her son Aegon as heir. The insulation of these two episodes helps heighten the tension between the two camps and lays the groundwork for what is sure to be an insane second season. 
While the fate of the Targaryen civil war is still uncertain, one thing is for sure: as soon as the second season premieres, I will be seated to see just how Queen Rhaenyra will handle her business.

Ed Sheeran. Red-haired, English, seemingly obsessed with math symbols, lovesick, hyper-mainstream — maybe. 
I don’t want to be so presumptuous to assume at least one of those adjectives popped in your head when you thought of the man that brought us the timelessly romantic zinger that is “Perfect,” but I bet I got a few right. In 2022, Sheeran’s the kind of artist you hear about in passing when he releases a video of himself as a faux-glam vampire or when he’s sued by Marvin Gaye for $100 million … oh, Ed. 
I’m not writing this installment to platform Sheeran — God knows he doesn’t need it. We all inevitably know him — either having grown up on his emotion-driven “X” and “÷” albums, or maybe despising him from an arms-length away because he’s always on the radio and yeah, it gets a little annoying. I’m writing, instead, to posit that we need to set aside what we think we know about Ed Sheeran and revisit him in his near-purest form — i.e. acoustic, English-sensibility Sheeran — and soak up all the autumnal vibes of his pre-2015 *works of art.* 
But, I must preface: I do not condone Sheeran rapping, as he’s done several times throughout his career. Okay, let’s proceed.
I’ve been a devoted listener of Sheeran since my preteen days: laying in bed reading “Harry Potter” while listening to “I See Fire” from the “The Hobbit” soundtrack on repeat for two hours was once my favorite pastime. 
Sheeran’s songs remain my main means of connection with one of my best friends from childhood, who once named a pet fish “Nancy” after “Nancy Mulligan,” and with whom I still belt out the entirety of “Castle on the Hill” while she sticks her head out of the skylight of my car on the freeway. 
“Lego House” and “A-Team,” two of his more widely-known earlier tracks off of “+,” have served as the perfect coming-of-age soundtrack over the course of my bumpy adolescence. 
Considering my storied history with Sheeran’s music, it was to my great surprise and delight that I discovered the gems that are songs like “She,” “Cold Coffee,” “Autumn Leaves” and “Fall” (could it get more October than these song titles?) are just in time for my favorite season this year. 
Chord progressions warm enough to spark a fire on a cold fall day — not like we’ve gotten any here in L.A. yet, but still — and oh-so-sweet lyrics I can pretend someone wrote about me define the songs on Sheeran’s “5” and “+,” which debuted in 2015 and 2011, respectively. I mean, “She’s like cold coffee in the morning”? That lyric rivals Andrew Garfield’s internet-famous description of Emma Stone as a “shot of espresso.” 
Sheeran’s earlier works also bare a great deal more of his raw, lovelorn songwriter side than most newer songs, though I’ll defend “Bad Habits” any day and have cried to “Supermarket Flowers” on several plane rides. The nearly-nine-minute-long ballad, “Give Me Love” — on which Sheeran wails and screams from the depths of his soul about wanting to be loved — spoke to 13-year-old me more than I’d like to admit. 
Whether you’re heartbroken, in love, yearning, homesick, suffering from existential angst or just one of those people who enjoys listening to soul-wrenching music despite being in a good mood, these songs are for you. 
If I haven’t persuaded you into popping in your headphones and channeling Sheeran’s smooth, earthy voice into your ears, that’s fine: I’d never force anyone to listen to my favorite music (though some of my friends may beg to differ after hearing me often ask, “Can I play this one song for you?,” absolutely rhetorically). If you do heed my words, though, I hope that you, too, find pieces of yourself in the gold mine of Sheeran’s discography.

There is something painful about recognizing that your parents are just as human as you are, complete with their own wants, needs and complexities. Parenthood is a responsibility not enthusiastically welcomed by all; many scrape by, trying to do the best they can, no matter the circumstances they’ve been left to operate within. “Aftersun” delicately sheds light on the emotional turmoil of being a provider and the duplicity of our memory.
“Aftersun” is written and directed by Charlotte Wells in her feature filmmaking debut and stars the equally graceful Paul Mescal (“Normal People,”  “The Lost Daughter” (2021)) and Frankie Corio (in her acting debut) as Calum and Sophie, a father-daughter duo on holiday in Turkey. Celia Rowson-Hall plays an adult Sophie, who recalls this holiday with her father several years later. 
Distributed by A24, the film’s producers include Barry Jenkins, who directed and co-wrote Best Picture winner “Moonlight” (2016). Jenkins’ inclusion in this project seems rather fitting, as the narrative and visual poignancy of his work feel like a critical touchpoint for Wells with “Aftersun.” 
Told partially through fragmented home video footage, the film’s episodic narrative is content to drift between sequences like the ebb and flow of the waves Calum and Sophie gleefully splash around toward the beginning of the film. Sophie alternates between past and present states, reveling in the awkward joy of being reunited with her separated father over quiet meals and sunny romps at their resort. 
There’s a constant sense of melancholy pervading each interaction between Sophie and her father, as if the brilliant façade of their holiday could crumble at any moment no matter how jovial they appear. In one of the film’s earliest and most affecting sequences, the camera lingers on Sophie lying awake in bed in the foreground, her father in the background separated by a sliding door. Outside on the balcony, bathed in silver moonlight, her father desperately attempts to light a cigarette with a broken wrist. It’s one of several instances in the film where the audience’s perception of Calum aligns with Sophie’s, who only comes to realize the gravity of her father’s fallibility as an adult. Although aloof and afraid, Calum desperately craves to provide his daughter with stability.
The film’s emotional impact is maximized by its consistently stellar visual compositions and fascinating editing choices. Filmed on location in Turkey, the film primarily works in intoxicating blue hues; daydreams fade into one another as blue skies meld with crystal-clear waters. 
Cinematographer Gregory Oke frames his subjects with magnificent empathy; shots of a young Sophie grinning up at her father are warm, joyous and radiating with daylight, which are contrasted with the uncertainty and darkness of sequences shooting an adult Sophie who attempts to reconcile the man she thought her father was with who he actually was (which the film sparsely shares concrete details about). 
In one standout sequence, a lone Sophie stumbles upon a group of teenagers by the resort pool who push each other into the water, their bodies intertwining and mingling like fish in the sea. Sophie looks on with wide-eyed wonder, her perspective filtered through the fluid and shifting underwater cinematography. There’s a hazy sheen to each memory that pads out the film’s narrative, which is complemented by the cinematography. 
The visual effects of the glitching home video sequences obfuscate Sophie’s recollections of her father, adding an eerie undertone to what initially appear to be cheery memories. The film’s expansive visuals provide viewers with a gateway into the rich interior lives of Sophie and her father.
To be frank, “Aftersun” left behind a slightly tepid feeling with several unanswered questions. Many uncertainties arise about Calum and his relationship with Sophie, as well as who exactly adult Sophie is, but the film seems to be uninterested in pointing viewers toward any definitive conclusions about the characters it depicts. 
The heart of this film revolves around the tender chemistry between Mescal and Corio, whose unwavering resolve to love one another (for better or for worse) elevates these already impressively-written characters. “Aftersun” may not satisfy every single moviegoer’s cravings, but it does fit comfortably into A24’s existing library and serves as a stirring showcase of Mescal and Corio’s top-notch performances as well as Wells’s filmmaking ability.

Environmental Student Assembly advocacy liaison and president of the SC Garden Club Olivia Heffernan requested Legislative Funding for the Parkside Garden at Tuesday night’s Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting. 
The Parkside Garden is USC’s only on-campus garden and provides an interactive green space for students. The garden requested $3,489.56 for materials that will help the garden. The funding was unanimously approved by the Senate. 
“[Parkside Garden] is a learning garden,” said Aidan Leitch, operations lead of the Parkside Garden. “It’s really the only opportunity for students on campus to get their hands on some soil and really learn about gardening … it’s also just a great space, it’s open, it’s outdoors and it’s a place for students to socialize.”
Chief diversity officer Zaid Diaz-Arias presented his preliminary progress on starting a new civil discourse workgroup. The group currently consists of himself, president Hannah Woodworth, vice president Nivea Krishnan and chief of staff Diego Andrades. 
“One of the things we discussed in our first meetings is democratic engagement,” Diaz-Arias said. “We reviewed Johns Hopkins’ Student Democratic Engagement report … which analyzed the climate that we are currently in with our democracy under strain in the United States and abroad. Specifically, [looking at] how that impacts diversity in the country and how we should be working to cultivate democratic engagement and civic discourse.”
Krishnan also shared internal USG updates including projects to increase intentionality, impact and outreach. USG has already revamped the online project tracker for students interested in seeing the progress of current expenditures. USG has also already initiated outreach activities through tabling, talking to registered student organizations and having a USG calendar of events. 
Krishnan also presented the legislative branch’s external projects she and Woodworth are overseeing. These projects include hosting administrative round tables to have a more intimate conversation with administrators about issues on campus through Associate Vice Provost for Student Affairs and Student Engagement Emily Sandoval, hosting housing rights workshops which will launch at the end of the semester to coordinate with the University to navigate housing in South Los Angeles and supporting RSOs through interpersonal conflicts within the organizations in regards to diversity, equity and inclusion.
Senator Aidan Feighery presented project updates including culture fest, a welcome event for spring admits. The event will focus on intersectionality and cross-cultural collaboration. Feighery’s other projects include helping international students fill out I-20 forms for summer work opportunities, keeping yellow jackets accountable in light of recent misconduct, preventing sexual assault  and working with the accessibility committee in collaboration with the Office of Student Accountability Services to make hybrid classes more available for students. 
The First-Generation Student Union expressed interest in a trial period next semester in hopes of being incorporated as an assembly. First-generation students are students who are the first in their families to attend college. 
“It’s an honor to get a trial period in the upcoming semester,” first-generation student union co-president Andrew Mecatl said. “We’re making history with this announcement, and we will continue to make history as we begin our transition into an assembly.” 
Chair of sustainability and campus infrastructure Sara Stienecker proposed the expansion of compositing facilities, providing recycling bins on Fraternity Row, providing reusable containers for students in Dining Halls and expanding U-Pass to undergraduate students as a transportation option. USC Transportation currently partners with the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to provide graduate students with reduced fares of $110 for first sign-ups and $108 for future semesters. The pass allows students to have unlimited rides on the Metro rails and bus lines. 
Stienecker also gave an update on SCÜP, the USC/LAX shuttle which was piloted during fall break. SCÜP distributed 1250 of 1430 available tickets, with an estimated 900 students utilizing the service. 
Chief communications officer Paul Yi shared that USG’s communications committee has met with Senior Communications Strategist for Student Affairs Gretchen Meier to increase social attention.
Diaz-Arias announced three new advocacy liaisons: Kevyn Calleja, a junior majoring in business administration and accounting, is the new liaison for Imagine, Dream, Access and Success; Sir William Cornwell III, a freshman majoring in acting, stage and screen, for Pacific Islander Student Association; and Antonio Okeke, a senior majoring in public policy and public administration, for Transfer Student Assembly. 
Senator Sam Nadol shared the nomination of David Wang, a junior majoring in business administration, as the special events committee co-executive director. The senate unanimously confirmed the nomination. 
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Gretchen Meier is USC’s Senior Communications Strategist. Meier is the Senior Communications Strategist for Student Affairs. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

“Vaxchella,” the influenza-coronavirus joint vaccination event co-hosted by USC Pharmacies and Student Health, ended Friday after two weeks of operation. In a briefing Tuesday with the Daily Trojan, Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman called the event “very successful.”
“We had crowds every day,” Van Orman said. “We were able to accommodate everyone who showed up most days. I think there were a couple of days the first week where we did run out of vaccines, [but] we were able to accommodate people the next week.”
In total, 2,353 coronavirus vaccinations and 1,877 flu vaccinations were administered at Vaxchella, surpassing expectations as stated Oct. 11 of administering 1,000 to 2,000 flu shots and coronavirus boosters to students, faculty and staff. The flu vaccine numbers from the event are just shy of 20% of Student Health’s stated cumulative goal of administering 10,000 flu shots for the season.
Student Health will continue providing vaccinations at the McCarthy Quad Trojan Farmers’ Market, USC Village and Pappas Quad weekly pop-up sites, as well as via walk-in and appointments at campus clinics.
USC’s inaugural Sex Week also came to an end, with the final event, “LGBTQIA+ Dating for Beginners,” which took place this Tuesday. Van Orman said the student response to the event was “overwhelmingly positive,” and that Student Health plans to “continue supporting it on campus” in future years.
“What we heard from students was that they appreciated the opportunity to have spaces that were safe, inclusive, positive — to learn and ask their questions,” Van Orman said. “Our hope would be that in future years, [Sex Week] becomes even larger, and we have more campus offices and more student groups participating, now that we’ve had the first one.”
Last Wednesday’s Sexploration Tent event was especially popular among students. Rachel Lichtman, associate director of public communications at Student Health, staffed last Wednesday’s Sexploration Tent and estimated that 300 students in total attended the event. Sunday’s “Ask the Sexpert” Instagram live event, hosted by Erin Tillman, intimacy coordinator and executive director of the nonprofit Sex Positive Los Angeles, garnered 594 views at the time of publication.
Sex Week events have been hosted at other universities since at least 2002, when Eric Rubenstein and Jacqueline Farber, undergraduate students at Yale, hosted a series of faculty lectures on sex-related topics. Since then, Northwestern University, Brown University,  University of Kentucky, Harvard University and others have hosted their own “sex weeks,” usually organized by students or student organizations. While Sex Week at USC was mostly student-run, it is also among the first of its kind to involve a university student health department.
Van Orman spoke on Student Health’s larger goals of preventing gender-based violence and advocating for reproductive health services, including sexually-transmitted infection screening.
“We believe firmly that these kinds of events help support those goals,” Van Orman said. “When there are spaces where people are able to have positive conversations about consent, about healthy sexuality, about conversations with partners, those really support good sexual health, which is really what we are focused on.”
88 total positive tests for coronavirus were reported to Student Health the week beginning Oct.16 — an uptick from the week before, but not necessarily reflecting increased transmission, due to absences during fall break. 
“We’ve really just been holding steady, which reflects what we’re seeing in the community: no surges in [coronavirus], but continual transmission at low to moderate levels,” Van Orman said.
Influenza cases among the USC population remain “sporadic” with no indication of “increases or surges,” according to Van Orman. The trend is consistent with data from the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, which on Oct. 21 reported that 3% of reported patient visits nationwide were due to respiratory illness — just above the baseline of 2.5%. Van Orman also noted a rise in respiratory syncytial virus, a common virus with cold-like symptoms, with related hospitalizations in the community, but not at Student Health.
Van Orman also announced the launch of Uwill, a teletherapy extension service made available to USC students Monday in partnership with USC Counseling and Mental Health Services. Uwill “provides a rapid path to therapy services,” according to the Student Health website, and is covered under the Student Health Fee. Students can access the service through MySHR.
“It’s just another avenue to provide immediate access to mental health services without having to wait,” Van Orman said.

The Association of American Universities elected USC President Carol Folt as chair of their Board of Directors Tuesday.
“I’m honored to have been selected by my colleagues, the presidents, and chancellors of America’s leading research universities, to chair the AAU Board,” Folt said in an AAU statement released Tuesday.
Formerly the vice president of the AAU board, Folt will now publicly spearhead AAU projects and act as the leading spokesperson for the association. She is also slated to lead discussions with lawmakers regarding national and federal policies affecting research universities. 
“AAU plays a central role in educating policymakers about the unique role that research universities play in our nation’s well-being and economic health, and I’m delighted in helping to lead such a wonderful organization,” Folt said.
Folt began her tenure as president of USC on July 1, 2019. Prior to USC, she served at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as president for six years and at Dartmouth College for 30 years as a professor of biological sciences and interim president. An accomplished environmental scientist, Dartmouth named Folt an endowed professor of biological sciences in 2007. Both UNC-Chapel Hill and Dartmouth are members of AAU.
Presiding AAU President Barbara R. Snyder said “President Folt brings a wealth of experience as a scientist and as a leader of AAU institutions both public and private,” said Barbara Snyder, presiding AAU president. “Her willingness to take on difficult challenges, even when under public scrutiny, makes her especially suited to serve in this role.”
Founded in 1900, AAU comprises 65 of the leading research Universities from around the United States. According to their mission statement, AAU strives to “help shape policy for higher education, science, and innovation; promote best practices in undergraduate and graduate education; and strengthen the contributions of leading research universities to American society.”

With three games remaining in the regular season, it is officially the homestretch for USC women’s soccer.
The Trojans will return from a three-game road trip to play University of Washington on Thursday at Soni McAlister Field. The Huskies, competing with a Pac-12 Conference record of 3-4-1 this season, can only hope to play spoiler to USC and UCLA as they close out the year.
USC, 5-1-2, sits at third in the conference behind Stanford and the crosstown rival Bruins.
In their last trio of away games, the Trojans defeated University of California, Berkeley 2-0 and tied University of Utah in a scoreless match before forcing a 1-1 draw against University of Colorado, Boulder on Oct. 23. Back-to-back ties complicate USC’s potential path to the top of the Pac-12, but the easiest — and really only — way  for the Trojans to end up on top is to win their remaining games.
“We’re the type of team where ties feel like losses,” said first-year Head Coach Jane Alukonis. “I think we came away pretty bummed, and know we have to have a really strong rebound.” 
In order to “rebound,”  Alukonis’ team must continue to do what they do best: keep the other team off the scoreboard.
Defense has been at a premium this year for USC, a team that has not allowed more than one goal in a game since its Sept. 15 win against University of California, Irvine, 3-2.
“I wouldn’t call us a defensive team,” Alukonis said. “We’ve always been known for attacking firepower, but certainly one of [our] aims was to improve defensively. Our backline has done great, goalkeeping has been great.”
Trojans graduate goalkeeper Anna Smith is third in the Pac-12 with nine goals allowed in 14 games. Washington is in the middle-of-the-Pac in defensive metrics, allowing the sixth-most goals in the conference with 15.
Washington’s attack is distributed fairly evenly. Five Huskies have scored 4 or more goals so far this season. Atop those options is fifth-year forward Summer Yates, who leads the team with 6 goals and 6 assists in 16 games this season.
“Summer Yates has been there a while and she’s always a target player for them,” Alukonis said. “She plays the 10 [star attacking midfielder] and she’s super creative.” 
Despite the team’s struggles, Washington’s offense is fourth in the conference in average goals at 1.63. Coincidentally, the Huskies allow 1.63 goals on average, ranking ninth among Pac-12 teams.
The Trojans offense is much more top-heavy, with the feature scorer being senior midfielder Croix Bethune. In 13 games this season, Bethune leads USC in goals (7), assists (8), shots (46) and game-winning goals (3). When she last faced Washington last October, she scored both of USC’s goals in a 2-2 draw.
“She’s very busy,” Alukonis said. “She’s one that opponents scout. She gets followed around every game by a man mark. I think she’s probably taken on the role as the most distracting player that we have right now, which in some games opens up opportunities for others.” 
USC will end the season on a three game homestand, capped off by a Nov. 4 finale against the No. 1 team in the nation, UCLA. While it’s still possible for that matchup to make USC eligible for the Pac-12 championship, it is unlikely given that both the Bruins and Stanford have a 4 point lead on USC in the standings as of Oct. 25.
“We’ve been talking about the [conference championship] since the day we got here,” Alukonis said. “USC has never won the Pac-12, despite winning two national championships. But at this point, the Pac-12 will not be determined solely by our results, but we know we’re still in it, and obviously we’ll fight until the end to finish as high as possible.”
USC will face off against the Huskies Thursday at Soni McAlister Field at 2 p.m.

Originally known as Division 1-A, the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the NCAA has had the top collegiate football teams in the nation for decades with schools like as Alabama, Ohio State and our very own USC.
However, the NCAA doesn’t have a stake in its postseason. Specifically, the NCAA does not actually award a national championship to any team in this division, the only one out of all the sports the NCAA sanctions. The reason why this occurs, as implied in its name, is that they are known as the “Bowl Subdivision.” This means that the teams play in bowl games or the College Football Playoffs which consist of bowl games as well rather than single-elimination tournaments as seen in the Football Championship Subdivision or the beloved March Madness basketball tournament. 
There have been arguments about whether or not the FBS should switch to a standardized tournament format. Regardless, what we have right now is a good compromise, especially with the expansion of the CFP to 12 teams by the 2026 season or earlier.
The history of how the national champion has been chosen in this division is a story in itself. Until 1991, the national champion was decided by both the AP and Coaches Poll at the end of the season, the same organizations that rank teams throughout the season. In order to spice things up with an actual title game, the Bowl Coalition and subsequently the Alliance was created during the ‘90s until they finally evolved into the Bowl Championship Series format — which was the standard until the Playoffs took over in 2014.
Within the bowl format, more teams have the opportunity to add to their trophy cabinet and earn money for their school and conference. However, on the other end, not everyone has an equal chance to compete for the national title, with a bias toward those coming from the Power 5 conferences. 
The rewards for the bowl games vary based on their prestige. For instance, the Markers Wanted Bahamas Bowl has a $225,000 total payout while larger bowls like Citrus Bowl have a payout of almost $8.2 million. Within the CFP system, a conference receives $6 million for each of its member teams that make it to the Playoff Semifinal. 
The FBS generated nearly $310 million in its final year under the BCS in 2013. The introduction of the CFP saw this amount rise to almost $648 million in 2018. Overall, this postseason format of the FBS subdivision has proven to be a strong financial opportunity for the teams and conferences involved. 
Once the CFP expansion sets in for the 2026 season (or possibly even earlier), the payouts and revenues will only increase with the elevated stakes that come with playoff games. Moreover, the inclusion of potential campus games in the first round for higher-seeded teams will bring more money to schools through ticket sales.
However, there are still some improvements for the college football postseason that should be considered. This is especially true for the national championship as it is played on a Monday rather than Saturday. This is because the NFL has games on Saturdays during that time of the year. To maximize viewership, the NCAA opted for a Monday game instead, like the NCAA basketball tournament championship. Attempting to take the Saturday slot back from the NFL would be great for fans since it is easier to watch a game on a weekend than a Monday night.
Despite being one of the most important components of college football and college athletics as a whole, the NCAA doesn’t truly have a say in who wins the national championship in the FBS subdivision. However, with the current bowl system bringing money and national attention to universities, the college football superteams aren’t complaining.

“The American Dream. The belief that America offers the opportunity to everyone a good and successful life achieved through hard work.” Throughout America’s history, this ideal has inspired hope in many people. It is a backbone of our nation, motivating millions to uproot their lives and immigrate to America. It has helped many get through difficult times in their lives by giving them something they can hope to achieve.
This aspiration is deeply rooted in the founding of this nation. Historically, immigrants sought refuge here to escape religious persecution, limited class mobility and many other restrictions. If one was willing to work hard they could, at least theoretically, build a successful life.
However, there is a flip side. For better or for worse, the American Dream finds its roots in individualism. It puts all the responsibility for achieving success on each American. And depending on one’s background the path to attain their dreams can be filled with varying obstacles. Since the founding of the nation, exploitation has been a major part of both politics and the economy. Many laborers suffered as those at the top reaped the rewards of their labor. It also cannot be ignored that the United States has a history of discrimination. 
The U.S. has taken land from Native Americans, enslaved African Americans and committed many more atrocities. If it could make them money, there were no limits to their discrimination and exploitation they would perform. Even today, the impact of these past choices cannot be erased. They still influence America systematically, and our economy is still willing to exploit people for profit. Despite promises to offer equal opportunity, there have been countless times America’s government has fallen short in keeping them. 
In 2022, politics are becoming more and more divisive. The times of finding common ground feel long gone. In all this chaos, where does the American Dream stand? Have politicians forgotten it? They seem content making promises about supporting it in their campaigns. However, this means very little without them taking any actual action to support it. It would be refreshing to see politicians make the changes necessary for the American Dream to be achievable for every American. 
But is the American Dream even achievable in 2022? If we’re being honest, it has never been a true reality in this country.  Perhaps, it’s achievable if you have the drive. Unfortunately, even then it is still not an even playing field and far from guaranteed. There are many setbacks still systematically holding individuals back and these issues are often  deep-rooted, learned from our long history of exploitation. There will always be many individuals who face more obstacles on their path to success. However, the American Dream originated from those determined to achieve it no matter how hard they had to work. As much as politicians try to claim the term, it has never been theirs. The tradition of hard work belongs to the people, not to an institution. 
No one has ever granted Americans equal opportunity to achieve their dreams. Instead, it is an ideal that we, the people, can strive towards. Each of us can choose to dedicate ourselves to taking the chance to make our dreams a reality. Even if that means we must fight for it or face it never coming true. That is the true spirit of this country: the generations of people who have worked against the odds to achieve great things. The U.S. is not a perfect place, but this tradition of hard work is something Americans can be proud of. The American Dream is simply a manifestation of all this.
Despite all the political upheaval, we can still have hope. For as long as the U.S. has existed there have always been corruption and contradictions that held our nation back from having equal opportunity. However, despite this so many have chosen to still take a chance on their ambitions. This is the true dream: having a goal, being brave enough to commit to it, and not losing sight of it despite the hard work along the way. 
Our history can teach us that the heart of this nation has always lied with the people who were willing to give up so much for the chance to chase their dreams or to give their children that opportunity. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that anyone will achieve this. The road to attaining one’s dreams might not be easy or even fair. Yet like so many who came before us, we can attempt to overcome the obstacles. Or at the very least, there is a lot we can learn from all those who have fought for their aspirations. In both the past and present, the American Dream is daring to hope.

I’d like to think of myself as a hopeless romantic. Despite how abysmal the future may seem — with death and destruction both imminent and concurrent — what remains ever-present is the love and affection that we provide one another. We all seek to find love, and for many that may mean succumbing to online dating. 
Tinder, Bumble, Hinge — or as I like to call them, the trifecta of the apocalypse. They’re more affectionately known as the three online dating apps scrupulously used by college students in today’s dating landscape. Whether users are seeking long-term relationships, friends or just casual hookups remains on a case-to-case basis. Nonetheless, their popularity among college campuses remains high with various studies showing that more than half of college students use dating apps.
That’s not to say dating apps are completely moot. Nowadays, lots of people seem to have found their partner or sometimes even their spouse through an app. Many of my own friends have met their partners on dating apps. Obviously, it’s completely possible to find love through digital means. Still, I firmly believe that these apps cause far more harm than good. 
For one, they completely exacerbate hookup culture. Hookup culture, or relationships that exist on the basis of sexual encounters, has become so deeply entrenched into our society that for many it has become an expectation. At a young age, especially in a college setting, exploring one’s sexuality is completely healthy and normal. However, for many, the desire for deeper connection is quite often packed away, as it’s believed that no one wants a relationship. Monogamy is too often the exception, not the expectation. 
Companionship and love are human desires that we all crave, but in which we seem to have relinquished faith — why is that? For college students, particularly in the USC area, these apps are simply a way to satiate negative energy. They serve as more of a quick fix for insecurity rather than a means to find meaningful connection. 
Doubting your desirability? Upload a few photos and receive likes in your Hinge home page or matches on Tinder by the next day. It creates a notion of optimization and of expecting replacement. Didn’t get a message back? Who cares when you have a shuffled deck of single individuals at your literal fingertips. Did I say singles? Perhaps not, as it’s even been reported that nearly half of Tinder users just so happen to concurrently be in a relationship. But it’s okay, don’t be distraught. After all, maybe your better match was just a few swipes away anyways, and how could you know if you stop swiping?
Why would you possibly put yourself in a position for rejection in real life when you can discover someone who is confirmed to find you attractive? We lose the desire and ability to have these vulnerable conversations when they are so easily avoided through a confirmed match. 
Simply speaking, these apps have managed to commodify the most carnal of our desires: sex, love and companionship. They thrive in a generation that is more insecure than ever, and one that is desperately in need of interpersonal connection, even if short term, abysmal, and possibly toxic. 
Let me be clear. There is no shame in using these apps. I use them on and off myself. Dating people you meet online is not inherently problematic or toxic. However, for many, these apps create a toxic relationship with oneself and with relationships that one may have with others. 
Hinge leads with the tagline “an app designed to be deleted,” a sentiment that resonates with both the lucky handful who find someone great on the platform, and for those who realize the app has been a smash or pass game with other hot lucky singles. But at the end of the day, it’s also a game between themselves and their subconscious that has a ghost of a chance of a happy ending.
