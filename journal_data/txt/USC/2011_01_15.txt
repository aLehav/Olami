Different zone, same problem for the USC men’s basketball team (10-8, 2-3) on Saturday night in Corvallis, Ore. as they fell 80-76 to the Oregon State Beavers (8-9, 3-3).
Seven minutes into the contest, the Beavers trailed briefly at 12-10, but behind sophomore guard Jared Cunningham’s team-high 24 points, coach Craig Robinson’s squad never trailed the rest of the evening.
Oregon State now goes to 8-0 on the year when having at least four starters in double figures.
 Against the Trojans, Cunningham’s big night was one of many bright spots. Senior forward Omar Johnson notched his second double-double of the season (12 points and 11 rebounds), while senior guards Lethan Wallace and Calvin Haynes eclipsed their season scoring averages with 12 points and 11 points respectively.
Craig Robinson’s well-implemented 2-3 zone trap seemed to plague USC throughout the night at Gill Gymnasium. 
Junior forward Nikola Vucevic was a one-man force on the interior all night long, posting a team-high 26 points and 14 rebounds.
The problem for Kevin O’Neill’s lethargic squad on Saturday night was that no else really made a big dent in the Beavers’ zone defense — a pattern that has been consistent in previous losses to Rider, Washington and Oregon.
Freshman guard Maurice Jones had 14 points in the defeat, but the Trojans looked a step slow all night long, in what was their second game in three nights.
The Trojans failed to get a victory on their two-game visit to the state of Oregon, and on Saturday night the box score tells the story for a team that still has yet to muster a thorough offensive attack against an opponent’s zone defense — USC recorded eight turnovers compared to just nine assists.
USC returns home to the Galen Center to take on the Stanford Cardinal (10-6, 3-2) at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday night.
Saturday night’s loss puts USC below .500 in conference play, and puts them in 7th place in the Pac-10 standings.

The Women of Troy (12-4, 4-1) topped Oregon State 53-45 on Saturday, improving to 7-0 at home on the season. 
But the win over the last-place Beavers (7-10, 0-6) didn’t come easy for USC, as both teams struggled offensively the whole game. During one span in the first half that lasted almost seven minutes, the two teams combined for five turnovers and only six points.
“It wasn’t a pretty game, but sometimes you just have to go with the old saying ‘Champions find a way to win,’ and that’s what we came out and did tonight,” USC coach Michael Cooper said.
The Women of Troy took a 23-19 lead into halftime, as both teams committed costly turnovers and shot a combined 26 percent from the field. The slow start continued a trend for USC, who have shown a disturbing trend of starting slow this season.
“It’s just a matter of having that mentality when you come out, getting ready to play from the beginning,” sophomore forward Christina Marinacci said. “It’s something that we have to work on, and I’m sure it’ll be different when we play Cal next week.”
Marinacci led all scorers with 13 points off the bench.
USC’s halftime was quickly erased as Oregon State started the second half with a 9-4 run to take a 28-27 lead on a jumper by senior forward El Sara Greer.
The Women of Troy responded with a 13-2 run to take a lead they wouldn’t relinquish. The Beavers were outrebounded 46-38, and committed 16 turnovers to diminish their chances at pulling an upset on the road.
“You’re supposed to win at home, it’s your home court, you’re in front of your fans,” Marinacci said. “Away games are really important, and if we can just get the momentum from our wins at home to carry us up north to Cal and Stanford, which will be really tough games, it’ll be really important.”
Junior guard Briana Gilbreath chipped in 12 points against the Beavers, who rank as the second-best defensive team in the Pac-10 at 53.7 points allowed per game. 
“We’re working on all of our perimeter people…asking them to put the ball on our floor and go to the basket because that’ll open up things for our perimeter [shooting],” Cooper said.” [Gilbreath] has been getting a good job of getting to the rim.”
Forward Cassie Harberts narrowly missed recording a double-double, gathering 12 rebounds while scoring nine points. 
With tough road games against Cal and No. 4 Stanford looming ahead next week, Cooper knows what the team has to focus on to win.
“Rebounding is key to our success… [because] it goes along with our defense. If we can defend you and make you take a tough shot, and we can rebound the ball, that does two things,” Cooper said. “That limits you just to one shot, and it gives us an opportunity to get some more shots when we’re doing our offensive rebounding. So that’s been our focus all season long, and it’s starting to pay off for us now.”

Late in the third and final set, senior setter Riley McKibbin soared into the air to challenge a ball directly above the net. Hovering in mid-air, McKibbin and a Long Beach State player palmed opposite sides of the ball, until the much shorter Trojan won the joust, sending the ball and the player to the floor.
Emerging victorious with a smirk, the captain’s scrappy effort punctuated a dominating Trojan net display from the outset, as the No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team (2-0, 2-0) dismantled visiting No. 11 Long Beach State (2-3, 1-1) in straight sets, 25-16, 25-17, 25-17.
Quite simply, the 49ers backcourt-based offense, while a topic of pre-game preparation because of its uniqueness, was ill-suited to counter an explosive, upfront hitting attack. Senior opposite Murphy Troy, sophomore opposite hitter Madison McKibbin and junior opposite hitter Tony Ciarelli combined for 28 kills, which were almost always uncontestable save for the occasional miraculous sprawling effort or unforced error.
“We’re a big, mature team, with a lot of upperclassmen,” said head coach Bill Ferguson. “We’ve been paying attention to the little details that go along with executing these kills, especially our footwork and balance.”
Amid the dazzling barrage of spikes, easy to ignore is Riley McKibbon and freshman libero Henry Cassiday’s instrumental setting and passing work. Murphy Troy—the game’s indisputable star with 12 kills, 9 digs, and 5 blocks—eagerly lent credit to the offense’s facilitators.
“I think we competed really well,” Troy said. “It was a big game, and we showed up. The great passing made it a lot easier for the setters to give us easy hits.”
Aside from an early 1-0 deficit in the first set, the Trojans never trailed during the match and never struggled for any prolonged stretches, thus never offering the 49ers any glimmer of hope to mount a comeback.
Improving the blocking was a focal point of practice during the week, and the Trojans quickly demonstrated a better scheme, rattling of three consecutive blocks in the first set to shift momentum quickly and to jump out to a 5-1 lead.
“I really like the way we blocked,” Ferguson said. “The guys were really tough upfront. With that said, it was a much different style of team we faced tonight; it was a much faster tempo. [Junior middle blocker Steven] Shandrick did really well and, of course, Murphy was phenomenal.”
While the Trojans held the advantage in virtually all statistical categories, including hit percentage (.444 to just .091), blocks (11.0 to 4.0), digs (31 to 18) and aces (3 to 1); perhaps the most glaring difference between the two teams was apparent in an intangible sense.
At many points, the 49ers, with sunken shoulders and hanging heads, appeared resigned to the reality that this was not their match. Conversely, the Trojans exuded the confident—bordering on brazen—swagger of a championship-caliber team. Whether it was Murphy Troy emphatically pounding his chest after another titanic kill or the Trojan reserves doing push-ups when they missed a kill during their warm-ups in between sets, the 49ers never approached the stratosphere of the Trojans’ intensity.
The Trojans will take to the road for their next five matches, beginning Wednesday against No. 7 UC Irvine at 6 p.m.
