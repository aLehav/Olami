Third-generation Trojan Michele Dedeaux Engemann, the namesake of USC’s new health center, has been elected to the USC Board of Trustees, the university announced Thursday.

Engemann received a bachelor’s degree in drama from USC in 1968. After graduating, she worked with Nine O’Clock Players Theatre for Children. The non-profit organization supports theater for children with disabilities or from disadvantaged families.
“Michele Engemann is a Trojan through and through,” President C. L. Max Nikias said in a statement. “She is also a visionary philanthropist who is committed to enriching all aspects of our students’ academic experience, from their physical well-being to their intellectual and cultural development. I know we will benefit greatly from her passion, creativity, insights and expertise.”
Engemann has held several university appointments in recent years. From 2007 to 2008, she served as the president of the USC Alumni Association Board of Governors. As part of her position, Engemann served on the Board of Trustees.
In 2011, Engemann and her husband, Roger, donated $15 million for the creation of a new health center. Construction is scheduled for completion next spring.
“I have friends who have grandchildren that go here,” Engemann said at the building’s groundbreaking ceremony in April 2011. “We are now into our third generation of students using that same facility. Roger and I have a keen understanding that this [new] building is needed and needed now, especially as USC becomes a more residential university and expects the health needs of students, grad students and faculty living and working in our campus community.”
The Engemanns have also helped support USC through a $500,000 donation to the School of Dramatic Arts and $500,000 for a Baseball Hall of Fame at Dedeaux Field.
Engemann is the daughter of former USC baseball coach Rod Dedeaux. She is also a lifetime member of Town & Gown of USC, Skull and Dagger, the Keck Hospital of USC Guild, the Trojan Guild of Los Angeles and the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority.

Ali Khosroshahin insists that the USC women’s soccer team has been playing “must-win” games seemingly for weeks, but with conference play heating up, that is especially true now.
Scoring · Junior midfielder Jordan Marada, a transfer from Saint Mary’s College, leads USC in points with three goals and five assists. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
After losing to Arizona State by one goal and tying Arizona on the road last weekend, the Women of Troy (4-5-2, 1-1-1) stand in a three-way tie for fifth place in the Pac-12 standings. And the road doesn’t get much easier, as they head north this weekend to face Oregon and Oregon State in two matches that their sixth-year USC coach and players once again view as “must-win” situations.
“Right now, we still dictate our own future, we don’t have to rely on anybody else,” freshman midfielder Megan Borman said. “But if we don’t win this weekend, then we’re going to have to do that. So we want to have our destiny in our own hands.”
USC ranks last in the Pac-12 in goals allowed per game at 2.09, and Khosroshahin says his young team will have to stop leaking goals if they hope to earn an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament.
“In all the games that we’ve played this year, our biggest opponent has been ourselves,” Khosroshahin said. “We get the better of the play then we make some decisions that are just ridiculous that leads to goals against.”
Players have echoed similar sentiments.
“I don’t want to blame it on the young back line, but I think it’s just mental lapses,” Borman said. “It’s just a lack of focus and a lack of discipline with getting back [on defense].”
The return of senior defender Kristina Noriega and senior defender Mia Bruno two weeks ago provided USC with a temporary boost in defense when it recorded its first shutout against Washington at McAlister Field.
But the Women of Troy regressed by allowing five goals to the Sun Devils last weekend, albeit with only nine players on the field by the end of the game because of two player ejections.
“It sucks that we’re ranked last [in goals allowed], but we’re not concerned at all,” said junior midfielder Autumn Altamirano. “We’re strong in the back. I think everything will be okay.”
On Friday, the Women of Troy will face Oregon State, which boasts one of the country’s top young goalkeepers in freshman Sammy Jo Prudhomme, who recorded a Pac-12 best of 13 saves against Cal State Fullerton on Aug. 30. Prudhomme’s 8.60 saves-per-game average pits her almost three points higher than any other Pac-12 goalkeeper.
Oregon State midfielder Megan Miller, who’s recorded three goals and five assists this season, leads the Beavers (9-3-0, 1-2-0). Junior forward Jenna Richardson tops the squad with four goals.
The Women of Troy will travel to Eugene, Ore. on Sunday to play the Ducks (5-5-2, 0-2-1). Oregon’s top scorer, freshman forward Kristen Parr, has six goals, while no other Duck has more than two scores.
Oregon sophomore goalkeeper Abby Steele has allowed 11 goals in 11 games while collecting 37 saves and recording four shutouts.
The Women of Troy have stellar all-time records against both Oregon schools, but have struggled against them in recent years.
USC is 13-5-1 all-time against Oregon State, but has lost the last three matchups. The team’s last win over the Beavers was a 1-0 victory in Corvallis, Ore. in 2008.
The Women of Troy haven’t beaten Oregon since 2009, after a 2-1 loss last year in Los Angeles and a 1-1 tie in 2010.
“I don’t think the opponent really matters right now,” Borman said. “Right now, any team we play is going to be good. The Trojans have been beating the Trojans. We have to get people working back and doing the little things.”
Khosroshahin remains confident his team can rebound.
“We’re still 1-1-1 in the conference, so we’re still in the thick of things here,” Khosroshahin said. “If we can get a couple of positive results this weekend, we’re in great shape.”
USC plays in Corvallis on Friday at 1 p.m. against Oregon State before another 1 p.m. kickoff on Sunday against Oregon in Eugene. Friday’s contest will be televised regionally on the Pac-12 Networks.

During the last four weeks, the parallels between 2012 Ohio State in its first season of sanctions and 2010 USC were becoming a little too eerie. Both teams fumbled through their first four games, narrowly beating teams they should have obliterated and shakily clinging to their undefeated status, with pollsters still pinning them around the middle of the Associated Press top-25 poll —mostly in deference to historical precedent.
Fast start · Despite starting 4-0 in 2010, quarterback Mitch Mustain and USC would drop five of their final nine games, to finish 8-5 overall. – Daily Trojan file photo
In the fifth week of the 2010 season, USC fell to unranked Washington on a last-minute 32-yard field goal by Erik Folk — a newly-minted Trojan nemesis who had also beat USC in 2009 — that set in motion a dismal 4-5 finish to the season and booted the Trojans from the top 25.
To be honest, I expected the same of Ohio State in its road matchup against No. 20 Michigan State last Saturday.
For everyone who came away unimpressed with USC’s methodical 27-9 dismantling of Cal, look no further than the week before to see the Buckeyes’ fortunate 35-28 victory over the Golden Bears on a 72-yard touchdown heave to wide receiver Devin Smith in the game’s waning moments. The preceding week’s lackluster 29-15 edging of still-winless UAB — at home, nonetheless — didn’t convert many to the Buckeyes’ bandwagon.
In advance of Ohio State’s first road game of the season, I anticipated (and, admittedly, hoped) the longtime Big Ten behemoth would stumble badly, as college football’s karmic way of punishing the Buckeyes for evading penalties far worse than whatever the Trojan administration was “supposed to know.”
Understandably, USC fans met Ohio State’s December 2011 sanctions with universal scorn. Former Ohio State coach Jim Tressel denied knowing his players were selling signed Ohio State memorabilia for tattoos — a blatant lie. There was even a paper trail linking former quarterback Terrelle Pryor to checks he received from a Columbus sports memorabilia dealer when he was a student at Ohio State — a smoking gun if there ever was one.
This is not the space, however, to relive past injustices. Trying to sort out the NCAA’s “rationale” can make your head spin.
The fact of the matter is: the Buckeyes did not falter against Michigan State, staving off the Spartans’ fourth quarter comeback attempt with stout defense and notching a narrow 17-16 win in East Lansing, Mich.
Now No. 12 Ohio State rightfully sits one spot ahead of No. 13 USC, though its positioning is largely inconsequential to the Trojans because the Buckeyes are not eligible for the postseason.
Ohio State, much like USC and every other team besides Alabama and perhaps Oregon, is flawed. It is subject to bouts of poor tackling, leading to explosive plays for opponents, and is over reliant on quarterback Braxton Miller’s playmaking ability with his legs. When Miller exited twice in the game against the Spartans, it became clear that needing a quarterback to run for more than 100 yards each game to win is a risky proposition.
Despite these flaws, however, there is significantly more hype surrounding the Buckeyes going forward than the 2010 Trojans ever had for two main reasons: The beleaguered Big Ten is eminently winnable and coach Urban Meyer is much more likeable than USC coach Lane Kiffin.
USC faced an uphill battle against Oregon and Stanford in 2010 and 2011, so the Trojans mostly disappeared from the public consciousness until they shocked Oregon at Autzen Stadium last season.
Moreover, the public perception of Kiffin was — and still is in many circles — of a petulant, entitled narcissist who rode his father’s coattails into the coaching profession. Critics believe a guy, who had burned so many bridges in the past surely had no chance of resurrecting the program.
Meyer, on the other hand, is universally respected, especially after successful stints at Utah and Florida.
By almost all accounts, the Buckeyes are positioned much better this season than the Trojans were in 2010.
That said, don’t let it surprise you if the season suddenly turns south and, you quickly begin to hear analysts professing the team’s imminent decline.
A loss to No. 21 Nebraska at home Saturday could begin a downward spiral similar to the one the Trojans experienced in 2010 after their upset loss to the Huskies.
In fact, controversy is already lurking beneath the surface.
On Sunday, news broke that Michigan State’s coaching staff accused Meyer’s assistants of doctoring the game film the team is obligated to send opponents before each game. Meyer’s film crew allegedly cut out pre-snap motions on offense, so that the Spartans couldn’t study the different motions the Buckeyes run out of various formations.
If this story balloons any further and coincides with an upset loss to the Cornhuskers, the Buckeyes might tread the same lonesome road of the hated and ignored the Trojans navigated a mere two years ago.
The verdict is still up in the air on how Ohio State will fare in the later stages of the season once the reality that they are not playing for a bowl game really settles. But the Buckeyes should know that early season success doesn’t mean much when you’re sanctioned.
Take it from a USC program that’s already been down the bowl-less road.

The USC women’s volleyball team opened its season with 13 consecutive wins, highlighted by a four-set rout over then-No. 1 UCLA at home on Sept. 19.
But since its hot start, the squad has cooled off a bit, dropping two of its last three games and now sitting in a four-way tie for third place in the Pac-12 standings.
After a sluggish couple weeks, the No. 5 Women of Troy (14-2, 2-2) will return to the Galen Center to face conference rivals, Arizona and Arizona State, on Friday and Sunday.
“The girls are working hard and I expect them to get better,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “It’s a work in progress, but by November I think we’ll be really good.”
Though November might loom large for the Women of Troy, their recent skid has tempered expectations — if only for the time being.
A three-set win last Sunday at Washington State proved to be a bright spot with the recent return of a dominant blocking game for USC.
Unlike their performances against Oregon and Washington, the Women of Troy, behind the stellar play of sophomore middle blocker Alexis Olgard, who recorded six blocks over the course of the match.
“Our blocking was much better, as it needed to be,” Haley said. “That definitely helped our offense get back on track, and it’s something we didn’t accomplish the last two times out.”
The Women of Troy would like to make quick work of Arizona on Friday night with the Sun Devils (13-4, 2-2) up next. Game times are scheduled for 7 p.m. and 4 p.m., respectively.
The Wildcats (9-6, 1-3) have struggled during Pac-12 play sporting a 1-3 record, and USC is in need of another confidence-building victory.
Arizona features sophomore outside Madi Kingdon, who ranks third in the Pac-12 in kills per game, but lacks complementary firepower past that.
With its last five meetings ending in USC victories, the Wildcats will be hard pressed to take down the nation’s No. 5 team.
Sunday, though, looks to be a challenging day with Arizona State coming to Los Angeles.
Led by two-time Pac-12 Freshman of the Week Macey Gardner, the Sun Devils feature arguably the top offense in the Pac-12.
They have tallied wins in five of their last seven matches, including a tight, four-set loss to Stanford last week.
The Women of Troy will have their hands full containing Arizona State’s newcomer, Gardner, and will need another signature blocking performance if they want to control the game come Sunday.
Senior captain Katie Fuller and freshman Samantha Bricio will look to recapture their early season form as USC needs all the offense it can get if it wants to keep up with the surging Sun Devils.
With a trip up north to play at Stanford and Cal looming, a three-game winning streak will go a long way toward regaining the confidence that came along with this season’s early excitement.
“We just need to stick to the game plan and I think we’ll be fine,” said sophomore setter Hayley Crone. “We showed Sunday that we could rebound from a couple of tough losses, and we just need to keep the momentum.”
Sunday’s contest against Arizona State will be televised on the Pac-12 Network.

Last month, the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team upended Stanford 10-9 in an overtime thriller in the semifinals of the NorCal tournament.

Fast forward three weeks later and the Trojans (14-0, 1-0) return to Palo Alto, Calif. on Saturday, looking to notch another win over the No. 4 Cardinal — with this month’s contest counting toward the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation standings.
The conference rivals square off at the Avery Aquatic Center at 9 a.m. in a televised game on the Pac-12 Network.
This time, though, the Trojans are hoping it isn’t as close.
“We allowed Stanford to get back into the game more than once,” said USC coach Jovan Vavic. “This time, we need to be more defensively aware and give no open looks to their deadly outside shooters.”
USC topped No. 2 UC Santa Barbara 14-5 to earn the SoCal tournament title last Sunday and the team hopes to use its strong performance to continue its double-digit winning streak come Saturday against Stanford (6-2, 0-0).
“We basically shut down every team we played early,” said junior driver Nikola Vavic, who finished with a career-high six goals in the championship game win over the Gauchos.
Stanford, as well, poses a similar threat.
“They’re strong and probably bigger than us, but if we can take them out early then we’ll be good,” Nikola Vavic said.
The Trojans are on a roll right now, but the current situation is all too familiar to some of the team’s veterans.
“We’ve been in this situation in seasons past, where we’re in a good situation in the rankings and with our record,” senior driver Michael Rosenthal said. “Two years ago, we lost to Stanford right after [winning] the SoCal tournament. We don’t want another letdown.”
In 2010, the Trojans were 15-0 after a SoCal tournament win and heading to Palo Alto, but they had their worst offensive output of the season in a 5-3 loss to the Cardinal, and lost at home to California the weekend after.
After playing five games this past weekend, Jovan Vavic and the coaching staff are taking measures to keep the team physically ready for the early start on Saturday.
Though the bulk of the conference slate is beginning, the schedule does have its advantages.
In five of the last seven weeks of the season, the Trojans only play one game per week, allowing for more rest in comparison to the packed-tournament schedules.
While the Trojans have yet to lose, their consensus is that there is still room to improve.
“Our counter-attack, our time-out, and our 6-on-5s need a lot more repetition and practice for us to really fine-tune them,” Rosenthal said. “By the end of the season, hopefully we’ll be more of a well-oiled machine.”

SALT LAKE CITY — USC’s Thursday night game at Utah began inauspiciously for the visiting Trojans, who were making their first visit to Salt Lake City in 95 years. But they weathered the early onslaught, prevailing for a 38-28 victory.
“At the end of the day, as you go through your season, your team builds itself,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “Those things [adverse situations] are good. You don’t like them at the time, but if you can rally from them as we did and come back, it’s good.”

On the second play of the game with quarterback Matt Barkley in the shotgun formation, senior center Khaled Holmes bounced a snap. Though Barkley successfully fielded the football on the hop, Utah defensive end Trevor Reilly exploded into the backfield and wrestled the ball away from the senior signal caller, returning it eight yards for a touchdown.
Just moments later, on the fifth offensive play of the game, Barkley and Holmes muffed another snap exchange, this time under center, and Utah recovered the football. Two plays later, Utah quarterback Jon Hays completed an 11-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Kenneth Scott on a fade route over junior cornerback Torin Harris’ outstretched arms.
Just 2:45 into the first quarter, the stunned Trojans trailed 14-0.
“It was kind of a low point,” said Barkley. “It’s not how we wanted to start the game — to give the other team 14 points.”
Undeterred, USC mounted the furious comeback it couldn’t three weeks ago at Stanford, outscoring Utah 24-7 over the rest of the first half to seize a 24-21 lead at halftime.
“We did a lot better job as a staff today handling negative plays than we did last time on the road,” Kiffin said.
Sophomore tight end Randall Telfer’s spectacular one-handed 23-yard touchdown reception highlighted the offensive breakthrough, leaving a raucous Utah sell-out crowd momentarily silent and bringing the Trojans to just a four-point deficit, 21-17.
“It was a great job of pushing it out of the way and realizing there was nothing  we could do about it,” Barkley said.
On Utah’s subsequent possession, junior cornerback Nickell Robey forced a fumble that junior defensive end Morgan Breslin recovered at the Utes’ 34-yard line. Though the receiver was initially ruled down before the fumble, the call was overturned after an officials review.
The Trojans took advantage of the Utes’ costly mistake, completing their drive with a six-yard touchdown pass to junior wide receiver Robert Woods — the final score of the half — for the second of Barkley’s three touchdown passes. On the evening, Barkley completed 23 of 30 passes for 303 yards.
“Going into the game, my two stats are to not turn the ball over and completions,” Barkley said. “Those were both evident today. I was happy with the completions, though I do feel like I could have put better placement on some of those balls. But overall, on the year, it was a good way to come back.”
Utah and USC played to a stalemate in the third quarter, but the Trojans began the fourth threatening at the Utes’ 32-yard line. USC couldn’t capitalize on the opportunity, however, as sophomore tight end Xavier Grimble dropped a surefire 27-yard touchdown pass in the end zone and sophomore kicker Andre Heidari missed his second field goal opportunity of the night, pushing the 44-yard chance right of the uprights.
The Trojans eventually broke through after a defensive three-and-out, with Barkley launching an 83-yard touchdown strike — the longest of his career — to sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee, giving USC a 31-21 cushion. Lee finished with 192 receiving yards, nearly surpassing his season-high of 197 yards he posted in the season opener against Hawai’i.
“That’s something that goes through my head constantly,” said Lee when asked about his penchant for making big plays. “Even within the first two seconds of the game, I want to do anything positive to help my team — making big plays, making bog blocks or taking one-yard catches. That’s what I’m going to do.”
On Utah’s subsequent offensive possession, Robey clinched the victory with his first interception of the season, returning it 38 yards for a touchdown.
“It actually felt good to get some balls thrown my way,” said Robey. “Coach said just be patient, it’s going to be a long game, and then we just started feeling out the quarterback. They started running the same thing over and over again. I just felt it and got a pick-six.”
USC returns to action on Oct. 13 against No. 23 Washington for a 4 p.m. matchup at CenturyLink Field in Seattle.
 
Quick Hits
— Freshman defensive tackle Leonard Williams earned his first career start for USC, supplanting redshirt freshman Antwaun Woods in the lineup.
— After undergoing minor knee surgery, sophomore running back D.J. Morgan ran for 46 yards on nine attempts for a 5.1 average per carry. His return to the lineup was critical, as senior running back Curtis McNeal appeared to suffer a head injury in the first quarter and never returned to the game.
— In other injury news, sophomore wide receiver George Farmer returned after missing consecutive games against Stanford and California. Farmer failed to record a reception. — Sophomore defensive end J.R. Tavai continues to be sidelined with an undisclosed injury and did not dress for the game.
— In a relatively sloppy contest, the two teams combined for 222 penalty yards on 27 penalties.
— USC tied the school record for consecutive games without being shut out at 186 (also occurred from 1967-83).
— With his six receptions, Woods moved into second place on the USC career receptions list.

There’s been a major stall in enjoyable film releases since the official close of summer break in late August. Sure, films like The Master and Looper have captured the attention of critics and audiences, but this fall season has also seen the likes of disappointing films such as Trouble with the Curve, Resident Evil: Retribution and Hotel Transylvania.
Fortunately, this weekend offers something for everyone. From high-packed action thriller Taken 2, to Disney-flick Frankenweenie, Hollywood’s hot new releases make getting off campus — if only for a few hours — well worth it.
Taken 2
Liam Neeson returns as Bryan Mills, former government agent, in  Taken 2, the sequel to the massively popular 2008 film in which Mills rescues his kidnapped daughter, Kim. Now, the kidnappers are back again for revenge, holding Brian and his wife hostage. Whether or not the ending to the first Taken warrants a sequel, this action film should be a mindless way to relieve school stress.
Frankenweenie
This Disney-Burton collaboration is not just a children’s film. Captured entirely in black and white with plenty of Burton’s signature spooky imagery, Frankenweenie opens to positive reviews from Rotten Tomatoes and Time magazine. Audiences will follow the morbidly creative tale of Victor and his dog, Sparky. When Sparky dies, Victor takes it upon himself to piece his best friend, hoping to bring him back to life. A play on Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel Frankenstein, Frankenweenie is sure be a treat for viewers of all ages.
The Oranges
A large cast of television favorites — including Hugh Laurie, Allison Janney, Leighton Meister and Adam Brody — assembles in this film about Nina (Meister) returning home for Thanksgiving after a bad break-up with her fiancé. Toby (Brody), son of her parents’ neighbors, seems the perfect rebound — but it’s somebody else who entrances Nina most. Despite the film’s poor reviews, The Oranges might still be worth checking out — if only to enjoy watching several great actors on the big screen.
The Paperboy
Zac Efron, Matthew McConaughey and Nicole Kidman star in this southern ’60s drama from director Lee Daniels (Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire). The noir-style film follows sheriffs and convicts in a small Florida town, but you’ve probably heard about the scene in which Nicole Kidman urinates on Zac Efron’s leg to cure a jellyfish sting. Though in limited release, The Paperboy has generated some massive buzz if not for awards contention then for the strange assemblage of talent involved.

“Do you have a tattoo?”
Visitors to the Craft and Folk Art Museum were asked this question as they walked through the front doors of the museum. And each time, the response differed.
Over the course of the night, visitors pulled up their sleeves, pulled down the backs of their shirts or even unbuttoned the tops of their pants to show off the designs imprinted on their skin. Showing off their ink got them free entrance into the opening night of CAFAM’s current show “LA Skin & Ink,” a look at the evolution of tattoos in Los Angeles over the last 60 years.
The show not only includes tattoo drawings but also delves into the influence of tattoos on other forms of art, such as painting. One piece invites viewers to sit on a reclining chair and watch as projected images of tattoos move across their skin. Though visitors might have already had tattoos, temporary ink displaying the show’s name was available courtesy of museum workers prepared with sponges on the show’s opening night.
“LA Skin & Ink’s” opening night event created a welcoming, fun atmosphere on its own, but the actual artwork will attract visitors any day of the week. Each section of the exhibit exists under its own theme — Tribal, Zulu, etc. — in order to present viewers with small snippets of a style, person or era instrumental in the development of tattoos in the city. As a whole, the show offers much to see, so it’s easy to get overwhelmed; yet the success of “LA Skin & Ink” lies in its ability to separate each theme while still managing to create a coherent show. Viewers can easily gain a lot of knowledge from one small section, even if they aren’t particularly attached to all the sections of the show.
Portrait photographs of tattoo artist Bert Grimm’s clients prove especially compelling. The pieces show the finesses of the artist on the skin of his clients but also communicate some of the personality of the subjects, who seem emotionally open as they honestly pose in front of the camera.
In the same way, a portrait in the section of Mr. Cartoon — a prolific graffiti and tattoo artist — shows Danny Trejo bare-chested and with a fierce look in his eyes. Trejo appeared in a video with Mr. Cartoon directed by photographer and director Estevan Oriol whose work also appeared at the show. Slowly, through viewing certain sections, the interconnectedness of the tattoo scene also comes through.
If some visitors came to the show only because their tattoo-loving significant others brought them, the section dedicated to fine art adds a twist that provides an alternative to the traditional tattoo imagery to the show. The works here come from tattoo artists who also make traditional art or, conversely, from fine artists with some involvement in the tattoo community.
Sergio Sanchez’s “No Pain, No Gain” uses oil on linen to depict a comical moment in which a woman screams as she gets inked on her back. The painting depicts her lying down with a cigarette in her hand and a can of Modelo nearby, white roller skates still on her shoes. The scene doesn’t totally make sense, but that only adds to the humor of the painting and plays off the serious expression of the tattoo artist at work.
Other figures such as Nikko Hurtado and Kevin Llewellyn bring tattooed figures to life in ornate frames.
From the electric pen invented by Thomas Edison to the walking examples of tattoo art mingling among each other at the show, it’s obvious the art of tattooing only continues to develop. At “LA Skin & Ink,” you can trace that history yourself and maybe find inspiration for your next ink fixation.
 
LA Skin & Ink runs until Jan. 6. CAFAM is located on 5814 Wilshire Blvd. Regular admission is $7 for adults and $5 for students.

Much like the way a live performer might have to take the stage following a co-star’s brilliant performance, a successful writer might have to contend with following a tough act — with one difference.
They have only themselves to blame.
Though many aspiring creators imagine that achieving mainstream success will put an end to all their concerns, the opposite is often true. Again and again, the career paths of major writers indicate that the popular novel, for some, is not a learned form but a chance event. The majority of writers will never know what success feels like firsthand, except perhaps as a one-time occurrence.
Mary Shelley once claimed that some people only have one good novel in them, and considering the small number of people who have read any of her post-Frankenstein creations, she would certainly know. Perhaps it would have been more accurate for her to say that some people only have one truly resonant novel in them, and, as a result, struggle to capture that bottled lightning a second time. Considering that writers from Aldous Huxley to Joseph Heller never quite managed it, clearly this is easier said than done.
The luckier breed of one-hit-wonder authors are the ones who produce not one renowned work, but a beloved series that they are then able to explore over multiple volumes. But at its worst, this trend can leave writers feeling trapped by their own creations.
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle grew weary of writing Sherlock Holmes stories and, in his frustration, eventually killed off the Baker Street detective in The Final Problem. Yet he underestimated the devotion of his fans. The outcry from his readers was impossible to ignore and — compelled also by a very real need to pay the bills — Doyle brought Holmes back to life and went right back to chronicling his and Watson’s exploits.
Even more extreme was the case of L. Frank Baum, who wanted to focus on books outside the land of Oz. Unfortunately, nothing else he wrote sold particularly well, forcing him to go over the rainbow time and time again. He put his foot down with The Emerald City of Oz, declaring it the end to the series, but monetary woes eventually led him to write eight more Oz books.
The desire for familiarity and for stories to continue is nothing new, and with mass media being the franchise game that it is, there’s greater incentive than before for writers to stick with what’s made them popular.
So just imagine the pressure J.K. Rowling felt to churn out another book about witches and wizards. As the first person to become a billionaire through writing alone, Rowling was free from any of the financial pressures that Baum or Doyle labored under, she wasn’t free from publishers, Warner Bros. and fans eager to see more of Harry and his world. As the author who inspired an entire generation of readers, giving into the demands of the ever-faithful followers must have been tempting.
And many writers would be happy to stay in the world they’d created. Lemony Snicket, for example, is publishing the first installment of a four-book prequel to his Series of Unfortunate Events later this month — and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.
Rowling, though, was itching to do something completely different with her first non-Potter work. Now dominating the display shelves of every major bookstore in the country, The Casual Vacancy is a magic-free, firmly adult tale of small town politics filled with enough sex and social satire to deeply confuse the millions of unwitting children who might be expecting more of the same from the woman who introduced them to Quidditch. That the two most popular ratings for the book on Amazon are one and five stars is not exactly shocking, and when the dust settles, the Harry Potter fandom might find itself decisively split between those who love only Rowling’s magnum opus and those open to what else she has to offer as a writer.
But this doesn’t mean that Rowling’s ruled out the possibility of returning to Harry’s world at a later point in her career. She hasn’t said anything concretely either way, avoiding Doyle and Baum’s mistake of burning a bridge she might someday hope to cross. In a way, it’s refreshing she doesn’t claim the foresight to know everything she’ll ever want to do. Though it might be frustrating not to have a definitive answer as to Rowling’s intentions for her literary future, fans should take comfort in knowing that if she returns to the world that gave her fortune and fame, it won’t be because she needs to or because they asked, but because there was more to say and more stories to tell.
Ideally, that’s the only motivation that matters.

Even though Christopher Knopf’s The Red Room takes place in Hollywood’s Golden Age, the family tensions it explores are timeless.

The NoHo Arts Center Ensemble tackles the challenging and realistic family drama, The Red Room, with aplomb. James J. Mellon and Brad Blaisdell have been with the NoHo ACE since its inception in 2004 and their vision continues to govern the company, bringing theater for its own sake to North Hollywood.
Acclaimed writer Christopher Knopf penned The Red Room as a semi-personal account of his family life set in the historical context of 1940s Hollywood. This adds a rich layer of history to the already compelling plot and makes the family’s problems more tangible. The time period also grounds the play, and characters pepper their speech with relevant and historically accurate names and references, adding a detailed sense of time and mood.
The intricate stage setting makes the audience truly believe they have wandered into the family’s sitting room. Costumes and settings add to the lavish ambiance of the time and can almost make viewers forget that they are not actually part of the family. Genuine visuals, coupled with the authentic dialogue, make the play believable and unapologetically human.
As the father, Edwin, Brad Blaisdell skillfully portrays his character in a way that allows the audience to sympathize with him. Edwin is a one-hit-wonder industry man who has trouble accepting his time in the limelight might be coming to an end. He spends beyond his means and resorts to alcohol in an effort to relive his glory days. Instead of celebrating his achievements, he is plagued by the ghosts of his past and feelings of inadequacy handed down to him from his father. Similarly to Shakespeare’s King Lear, Edwin is an aging monarch; he is not ready to relinquish his power. He seeks to live vicariously through his children by pressuring them to follow in his footsteps.
Despite the fact that she might not always agree with Edwin, his wife, Rose (Janet Fontaine), stands by his side. Although Rose represents a stereotypically submissive wife, Fontaine brings life to her character. She seeks to “weather the storm” while trying to keep the family together. Rose’s tenderness and maternal charm calls attention to the schism within the family; at times, her sweetness and earnestness in the face of bitterness and anger provides a painful contrast. Though her character does not include the backstory that Edwin’s does, viewers are still able and eager to sympathize with her.
The three sons are less prominent than Edwin and Rose, but add interesting subplots and color to the play. David (Chad Coe) work in the industry and share their complicated and checkered pasts. Though these characters could benefit from further development, the roles they play in the family dynamic are adequate and relatable.
It is the youngest son who has the most intricate character of the three boys. Near the end of the play, the youngest son, Johnny (Lane Compton) says, “In college you learn who others are,” but he needs to pursue his own dreams to learn who he is. This search for identity remains especially relevant to students and young adults. His visible clash with Edwin over life choices reinforces the ideas of inadequacy and living up to parental expectations. There is neither a clear-cut answer to the questions posed nor a resolution between father and sons. Ambiguity and silence provide a harshly real, if somewhat unsatisfying conclusion.
The play’s use of silence serves to highlight key actions as well as build the tension between family members and competing ideologies. Some of the most important actions take place in complete silence. This places a premium on the actors’ movements and draws the audience deeper into the emotions of the family. Yet, timely music also plays an important role in transitioning between flashbacks and the present. Though the music lacks variation, it seems to be a purposeful and stylistic choice, which mirrors how the main characters are caught in one place and time.
The dynamic family interactions, facilitated by the tasteful casting, bring The Red Room’s themes to life. Actors and students alike will be able to find themselves in the character’s struggles for identity, approval and success. Unlike a television show that can be turned off or tuned out, The Red Room will leave an impact on audiences through its thoroughly human portrayal of family tensions.
 
The Red Room is showing through Sunday, Oct. 28 at the NoHo Arts Center,  located on 11136 Magnolia Blvd. in North Hollywood.

The presidential debate Wednesday night highlighted just how fundamentally the two presidential candidates differ on how to relieve the nation’s debt crisis.
At one point in the debate, moderator Jim Lehrer posed the question: “What are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?”
Robert Calcagno | Daily Trojan
Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney responded that bringing down the deficit is both a moral and economic issue.
“It’s, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they’re going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives,” Romney said. “And the amount of debt we’re adding, at a trillion [dollars] a year, is simply not moral.”
Though Romney was well-spoken and poignant during the debate, conflicting statements about education and a vague economic plan indicate a critical lack of understanding and his inability to put forward a policy that will truly lessen future generations’ debt burden.
Romney’s five-point plan promises 12 million new jobs over the next four years. To fulfill this promise, Romney wants to cut taxes by $5 trillion. The tax cuts are mostly for the wealthiest Americans, leaving an ever-growing financial burden on the lower and middle classes. This is not a step forward for the millions of young Americans who will have to or are currently taking on student debt, but an additional financial burden that students and future generations will all have to face if Romney is elected president.
Though neither candidate touched on the issue of student debt much in the debate, it is key to understand the difference between their approaches to the topic as it directly impacts future generations. Romney plans to reverse two concrete, beneficial steps President Barack Obama took to relieve current and future students’ debt — lowering the loan payment cap to 10 percent of income and decreasing the required number of years for an unpaid student loan to be forgiven from 25 to 20.
Throughout the debate, Romney often dodged the question of student debt entirely. In the beginning of Obama’s second two-minute segment, Obama said that he “want[s] to make sure to keep tuition low for our young people.”
Romney’s following two minutes focused on anything but rising tuition costs — rather, he returned to taxes, middle-income families and energy policy. Granted, Obama didn’t delve any deeper into the issue, but at least he mentioned it.
And immediately after preaching that “education is key,” Romney advocated cutting federal training and education programs. But he later said he has no plan to cut education or student loan grants, although he had previously endorsed vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan’s budget plan, which includes $170 billion in Pell Grant cuts. Hypocritical logic such as this is far from presidential, and even farther from the solid economic reform that future generations need to lessen their debt burden.
David Axelrod, Obama’s senior advisor, told reporters after the debate that Romney “came to give a performance and gave a good performance and we give him credit for that. The problem is that none of it was rooted in fact.”
Unlike Romney, Obama has taken many clear-cut steps that directly alleviate younger generations’ debt burden, including a student loan package that prevented loans rates from doubling and a health care act that allows young adults to stay on their parents’ health care plans until they’re 26 years old.
Though polls show that Romney came out as the winner of the debate, his economic vision is not compatible with the needs of current and future students — the future generation that will have to live, study and work under this policy should he be elected president.

And what do students hope to do when they graduate? Pay off student loans and find a career. This is why students should all be paying special attention to what was said by both candidates regarding the economy in Wednesday night’s presidential debate.
The candidate who wins the election will substantially determine the economic climate while we’re looking for jobs and future students are trying to pay for college — and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is the candidate whose policies best address these needs.
During the debate, Romney and Obama both outlined strategies to lessen the national debt and create jobs, with Obama’s emphasis on spending on government programs to boost the economy and Romney’s promotion of tax cuts. The two actually seem to agree on a number of issues — prioritizing relief for the middle class and emphasizing the importance and role of small businesses, to name a few — but Romney’s plan for the economy offers more specifics, focuses on sounder economic principles and will be more easily implemented.
To improve the economy, Romney will focus on five goals: energy independence, increased trade with Latin America, unparalleled level of education, a balanced budget and improved conditions for small businesses.
He emphasized that his plan is revenue-neutral, meaning none of his tax cuts will add to the deficit. In addition, he plans to decrease trade with China and eliminate unnecessary programs based on the criteria Romney outlined in the debate: “Is the program so critical that it’s worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?”
Romney’s policies focus on exactly what younger generations need to avoid having to pay off massive debt later in life. Rather than increasing taxes, which would initially slow the economy before anything improves, Romney wants to cut unnecessary spending and programs. The benefits of this will manifest quickly, and it is a more sustainable way to alleviate debt — instead of asking Americans to pay for programs that add to the deficit. Romney’s pledge to cut excess government will lead to a leaner and more efficient economy for future generations.
Many current and future students worry about paying off student loans not only during college but for years after graduating. Facing an enormous deficit on top of that would make their debt burden far worse. While the issue of student debt was largely ignored during the debate, both candidates considered improving America’s education system one of the top priorities for alleviating our economic situation. And while Romney’s opposition has criticized him for planning to cut education funding in the past, he made it clear in the debate that this is no longer the case.
“I don’t have any plan to cut education funding and grants that go to people going to college,” Romney said. “I’m not planning on making changes there.”
Since financial independence for many is just around the corner, students should focus on how each candidate will affect the economy over the coming years. While Obama’s plan has similar end goals to Romney’s, our nation cannot handle the kind of spending that he proposes. For students who don’t want to carry the burden of trillions of dollars of debt, for themselves and for future generations, they must vote Romney this November.

I’m a bit baffled as to how Kadvany could have watched, listened to or read transcripts of the debate and still come out with, “To fulfill this promise, Romney wants to cut taxes by $5 trillion. The tax cuts are mostly for the wealthiest Americans, leaving an ever-growing financial burden on the lower and middle classes.” That is specifically what Romeny said he will NOT do–numerous times! And by the way, Romney’s plans to improve the economy and increase the number of jobs IS a plan for alleviating younger generations’ economic suffering! Improving the economy is a better and more direct way of alleviating economic suffering than taking goodies away from some (insurance companies and banks that make student loans) and handing them out to others (young people).
Keeping rates the same is not a ‘cut’. Is the tax code serving to unite the country or divide it? Is the federal government doing too much? Is the federal reserve in charge? What does the federal government do well and cheaply?
