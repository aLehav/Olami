Leaders in politics, business and advocacy said Wednesday that the Latino community is one of the most involved in the fight for conservation during an event at the Davidson Conference Center.

Experts at the California League of Conservation Voters Education Fund’s “Salud, Familia, Comunidad: California Latino Voters and Our Air, Land, and Water” also said that global preservation should be a more pressing issue for state policymakers.
The conference’s panel featured Sen. Kevin de León, representing California’s 22nd Senate District; Assemblyman Ricardo Lara, representing California’s 50th Assembly District; Veronica Gutierrez, vice president of local public affairs for Southern California Edison; Irma Muñoz, CEO and president of Mujeres de la Tierra; and Marta Segura of Diverse Strategies for Organizing, Inc.
Other featured commentators included Sarah Rose, CEO of the California League of Conservation Voters Education Fund; Ben Tulchin, president of Tulchin Research; and moderator Victor Griego of the Diverse Strategies for Organizing, Inc.
While introducing the panel, Rose said that the state can improve its current environmental policies.
All the panelists agreed that California needs to become more active in its policies regarding the preservation of the earth, but also that Latinos serve as one of the most active communities regarding these issues.
Lara, a state representative, emphasized the effect of environmental issues on Latino communities. Latinos in Southeast Los Angeles had an 80 percent chance of contracting some sort of cancer, Lara said. Children in Latino communities are forced to play in the street because there are no parks and water is not affordable, he said.
According to a study from the CLCV Education Fund that looks at the environmental attitudes of California Latino voters, 90 percent said they believe that protecting the environment and creating jobs are not exclusive. Additionally, 66 percent refer to themselves as conservationists.
Veronica Gutierrez places her faith in the various communities with agriculture backgrounds who immigrated to the United States. She referred to Latinos as the “original folk with the reusable bag,” arguing that Latinos come from a history of farming and agriculture, and understand more than most the importance of conserving our natural resources.
Some of the issues that Latinos list as important in the CLCV survey include water pollution, renewable energy, energy conservation, toxic pollution resulting in disease and conserving fish and wildlife habitats.
Concerns from the Latino community seem to be substantiated by recent data. According to Executive Summary from the California League of Conservation Voters, 25 percent of Latinos in California have at least one household member suffering from asthma.
“We’re speaking different languages at times, but we all want the same thing — we want clean air and clean water,” said de León.
Please stop this racist crap!  USC now has splinter groups.  When I was a student, we were all Trojans.  Latino Trojans, Black Trojans, Asian-Pacific Trojans, LGBQT Trojans!  If you’re a Trojan, you’re above such crap.
Stop it!
Fight On!

As the university prepares to present its proposal for The Village at USC to Los Angeles city hall next month, small business owners in the University Village are negotiating over the fate of their livelihoods.
Economic cycle · John Urteaga, the owner of L.A. Bikes, says he hopes USC will allow him to continue leasing a store at a moderate rate. – Rachel Bracker | Daily Trojan
A USC negotiator met with a representative of current tenants last Friday, but neither side has an estimate for when talks might conclude other than that they will before the university begins demolishing the UV, which could be as soon as this summer.
The city’s Planning and Land Use Management Committee approved a  proposal last week for the University Village to be demolished and the $1.1 billion Village at USC to be built in its place. USC expects the city council to give final approval on the plan in November.
Of the nearly 45 tenants not affiliated with USC, all but two will be on month-to-month leases by May, according to USC’s Real Estate and Asset Management Department. Those two businesses, Bank of America and Starbucks, will negotiate separately with the university. Forty other businesses, however, are unsure of their fate.
Business owners are asking for right of first refusal, rent subsidies if they return and financial relocation assistance. Some business owners said USC has already offered to provide an expert in relocating businesses to help them move.
USC’s first University Village proposal, known as the Specific Plan, did not have a provision for current tenants to have a spot in The Village at USC. In the last two months, however, several business owners have made a concerted effort to make their voices heard at the City Council’s PLUM meetings, with about a dozen business owners and several employees attending.
Their advocacy helped to bring about an Oct. 5 addendum to the Specific Plan, which stipulates that the university must negotiate with tenants in good standing before demolition begins and pursue good faith efforts to retain them.
John Urteaga, who opened L.A. Bikes in 2001, said his biggest concern is what the rent will be when The Village at USC re-opens.
“All I want is to come back and be able to rent the property at a fair rate,” Urteaga said. “USC could double the rate if they wanted to. I’d like them to give [current tenants] a percentage discount for the first few years we come back.”
Executive Director of Local Government Relations David Galaviz said the university is weighing the situations of business owners with new business hiring that would increase the number of total workers at The Village after rebuilding the property.
“We want to be sensitive to the needs of the current businesses and there is a public process that needs to be done in order for us to demolish The Village in the first place,” Galaviz said. “On the other hand, we want to be very sensitive to needs of existing tenants. There’s an incredible popular demand from who want to see the jobs provided in the village and see the economic development spurred by the new village.”
Rahmae Muhammed, who opened the restaurant Kebab Master last year, said financial compensation for relocation is necessary for her business to stay afloat. She said she worked five jobs to make the money to open her business in the food court.
“I’m only 29 and I’ve worked my butt off to open Kebab Master,” Muhammed said. “It’s hard because I’ll lose my money and that time. I want to feel happy and comfortable to build my business.”
Kristina Raspe, vice president of Real Estate and Asset Management at USC, said tenants have been aware of the university’s plans to renovate The Village since plans to rebuild the space were created almost a decade ago.
“Most of the tenants came to the village after we began planning for the redevelopment nine years ago,” Raspe said. “A lot of those who came to the [university] village and said, ‘we know you’re going to be tearing it down soon; We just want to see if it’s a viable market.’ It’s not correct to assume they are all long-term tenants.”
Raspe also said the leases hold tenants financially responsible for renovations that are part of doing business, although tenants receive a lesser rate for doing renovations that would be part of the university’s responsibility as landowners.
Wendy’s franchise owner Ketan Sharma said the out-of-pocket costs to build his business 22 years ago was about $1.5 million, a sum that took several years to pay off. He said that cost, paired with about $400,000 in renovations nine years ago and franchise fees, mean he has just recently began profiting.
“The most important thing for me is having my Wendy’s back in the newer [Village], knowing what kind of assistance I can expect from USC as far as relocating and how it’s going to be financed,” Sharma said. “I’ve contacted two people, but USC will have to follow up on this.”
Sharma said his discussions with USC over the future of his business, which predates USC’s takeover of leases in 1999, have made him tentatively optimistic.
“I’m excited about the project, but it scares me as a small business owner,” Sharma said.
No man can stop change.
I really hope USC has the sense to kick out L.A. Bikes! They don’t know how to do a simple tune-up, they actually messed up my bike to the point where I had to take it to Lyons Bike Shop to fix the mess that L.A. Bikes made. I am also pretty sure they sell stolen Bikes.
I am all for USC retaining some of the great local businesses- like the Village Cobbler, Nails by Wendy, Sandwich Island, among others- but USC needs to really look at which shops will be an asset to the student population and the local community!
As long as the construction noise doesn’t wake me up early in the morning, what do I care?

After a large decrease in dining hall supplies because of theft, USC Hospitality is working to address students who take utensils, serving dishes and food from the dining halls.
Earlier this month, USC Hospitality posted signs informing students that they could face $100 fines for taking serving supplies or food from the residential dining halls, with the exception of fruit or ice cream. Though students have been reported this year, as of now, none have received a monetary punishment, according to Director of USC Hospitality Kris Klinger.
Though the policy has been in place for several years, the decision to reiterate it comes on the heels of a sharp decrease in serving supplies, according to Klinger.
“We ordered enough to get through the entire day,” Klinger said. “Right now we can’t get through an entire meal service.”
Many students said they understand the concerns about removing serving supplies, but believe that they should be able to take food with them.
“I don’t mind not taking silverware and obviously that costs them money to replace,” said Gilles De Prevoisin, a freshman majoring in chemistry. “But the food is going to be there regardless.”
Klinger said, however, that the concern is largely because of students who take large amounts of food from the dining halls.
“Some students are bringing their backpacks in and have been caught putting loaves of bread and half-gallons of soymilk in their backpacks under the assumption that it is a grocery store as well,” Klinger said. “So those are the kind of concerns that caused us to have to post the fines to remind everybody that that is not OK.”
Many students said because their meal plans allow for unlimited swipes, students should be able to take food out of the hall. Several students said their class schedule does not allow them to sit down for a meal in the dining hall, causing them to take food to go.
“I think they should let us take sandwiches,” said Giovana Rodrigues, a freshman majoring in business. “In between classes, I don’t have a lot of time so I have to wait until 3:30 [p.m.] without eating.”
Glad our  daughter is transferring!
And I guess by “transferring” you mean “failed out?” hah
Did you raise her to steal bananas?

Former United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates spoke about foreign and domestic policy, including pressing national security challenges the United States currently faces, as part of the President’s Distinguished Lecture Series in Town and Gown on Wednesday evening.

Gates discussed the unstable relationships between the United States and several Asian and Middle Eastern nations, including China, Iran, Syria and Libya. He also emphasized the importance of bipartisanship in Washington to ensure that the government is effective in other aspects of policymaking and international relations.
“At a time when our country faces deep economic and other obstacles at home, in a world that just keeps getting more complex, the inability of political leaders to step outside of their partisan cocoons or to offend their most partisan supporters has become a threat to America’s future,” Gates said.
Gates, who wrote a memoir about his experience working under five presidents who all contributed to the end of the Cold War, said he believes consistency in political strategies will best accommodate the fundamental interests of both parties and the public. He noted that in his 46 years in Washington, success was most evident when there was continuity between different administrations.
“We need political leaders willing to rise above it all,” Gates said, emphasizing the importance of bipartisanship.
Gates served as secretary of defense under both President Barack Obama and President George W. Bush from 2006 to 2011. He is the only Secretary of Defense in United States history to be asked to stay in office by an incoming President. He also held the position of director of the Central Intelligence Agency from 1991 to 1993, and is the only officer in CIA history to rise from an entry-level position to director.
Gates said he hopes the winner of the upcoming election will place the majority of their focus on getting the country’s finances in order.
“Doing so would remove the pall that hangs over the American economy at home and American power and credibility overseas,” he said.
After his lecture, the former secretary answered questions from students in the audience.
When asked about the United States’ potential to pursue military action against Iran if diplomacy fails, Gates said all other options should be exhausted first.
“I had a view of both wars under two presidents, and frankly, I think in recent decades U.S. presidents have been too quick to reach for a gun to solve our problems,” he said.
Despite the many problems Gates discussed, he said he is confident that the United States will rise above the issues at the forefront of American politics.
“I still remain fundamentally optimistic about the future of this country,” Gates said. “Even though the United States faced enormous obstacles, most of them are self-inflicted, and we also have the power and the means to overcome them, as Americans have in the past.”
He also expressed positivity to those in the audience who hope to go into public service. Gates advised students to ignore those who tout the corruption of government.
“All I can say is do it. You read about the difficulties but what they don’t write about is how much satisfaction there is, how much joy there can be,” he said. “At the end of the day, most who go into [public service] are optimists and romantics who believe we can make a difference.”

Halfway through a season that was supposed to end with the Trojans hoisting the crystal football in South Florida, let’s just say things have not gone as smoothly as expected. USC holds a respectable 5-1 record, including a 301 mark in Pac-12 play, and is in no way out of contention for the national championship, especially after coming in at No. 10 in the first BCS standings of the season. But as anyone who has watched the team thus far will attest, there are a number of issues that need to be sorted out before any more national title talk can be taken seriously.
Perhaps the most surprising part about the current state of the team is that most of these issues are on the offensive side of the football. Last season, the Trojans’ offense was downright lethal, averaging more than 35 points and 456 yards of total offense per game. The team featured a 3,500-yard passer in quarterback Matt Barkley, two 1,000-yard receivers in Marqise Lee and Robert Woods and a 1,000-yard rusher in Curtis McNeal. With the addition of star running back transfer Silas Redd, just about everybody expected the Trojans to light up the scoreboard at an even more impressive rate this season.
Needless to say, that hasn’t happened. On the surface, the offense does not look that bad: 32.3 points per game is nothing to scoff at, and the team averages 415.2 yards of offense per game. When watching the games live, however, the unit’s struggles appear more than evident.
Barkley and Co. have yet to have a game in which they looked completely in control. The season-opening victory against Hawai’i featured a nearly non-existent rushing attack, and the following game against Syracuse was anything but pretty, despite Barkley’s six touchdown passes. The Stanford game was abysmal by all accounts, and since then the offense has been shaky at best in victories over California, Utah and Washington.
So what gives? This is essentially the exact same offense that was scoring at will in the second half of last season; the only changes have been inserting Aundrey Walker at left tackle (though certainly a downgrade compared to former starter Matt Kalil) and Silas Redd at running back (a definite upgrade over former tailback Marc Tyler).
Perhaps the Trojans’ most obvious shortcoming to date is an inexplicable inability to pick up first downs. Last year’s team converted a robust 48 percent of their third downs. This year: a woeful 30 percent, a figure that was worsened by last week’s awful two-for-12 performance against Washington in Seattle.
To what can we attribute this mediocre performance? Mostly mental errors. USC has been unable to excel in high-pressure situations, a result of not keeping its cool when the stakes are raised. Moreover, USC has often been ravaged by penalties that put the Trojans in third-and-long situations that are nearly impossible to convert.
Given that these same players experienced so much success last year in third-down conversions, Trojan fans should expect the team’s performance in this regard to improve moving forward.
Perhaps the pressure of an expected perfect season with virtually no margin for error clouded the team’s focus in the first half. Or maybe this is a group of players that simply experiences slow starts to the season. After all, USC averaged only 30 points per game through the first half of last year before going on a tear in the second half in which the team averaged 41.5 points per game. Perhaps this year’s squad has a similar hot streak in them.
Frankly, this offense is too experienced and too talented to continue to be plagued by seemingly easy-to-fix mental errors. And if the goal is still to capture college football’s biggest prize, then the team will have to re-establish its focus on the little things in order to be the last ones standing at season’s end.

Not all midseason Pac-12 games are created equal. Thursday night’s matchup pitting No. 3 Oregon against Arizona State for a 6 p.m. clash at Sun Devil Stadium on ESPN brims with implications for the conference, generally, and USC, particularly.
To this point, Oregon and Arizona State are two of three teams that remain undefeated in Pac-12 play — Oregon State is the other. Though early, Arizona State at the moment sits ahead of No. 10 USC in first place in the Pac-12 South division standings.
Hostile environment · Sun Devil Stadium is not hospitable to visiting teams. In 2011, USC lost 43-22 at Arizona State for its first road game. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The initial Bowl Championship Series standings’ major deviation from the Associated Press poll is that it places Florida at No. 2 instead of Oregon. The switch occurred because the computer polls — which compose one-third of the BCS formula — were largely unimpressed with Oregon’s schedule thus far, computing an average ranking of 6.5, with the Wolfe computer even ranking Oregon No. 10.
The Ducks will look to post a quality win over the Sun Devils — whom they beat last year at Autzen Stadium 41-27, improving their national perception with likely their stiffest challenge to date.
Any doubts swirling around Oregon stem from the team’s relatively weak non-conference schedule to open the season, in which it played Arkansas State, Fresno State and Tennessee Tech. Moreover, the Ducks have only played one road game — against Washington State at CenturyLink Field, where the crowd was predominantly comprised of Ducks fans.
Sun Devil Stadium’s raucous crowd can give a signal caller fits when trying to communicate the cadence, as then-junior quarterback Matt Barkley learned last season. Oregon redshirt freshman quarterback Marcus Mariota will have to adjust to his first career appearance on the road in a completely hostile environment.
Mariota’s worst career start occurred in the game at CenturyLink Field, where he threw two of his five interceptions this season.
If USC wishes to re-enter the BCS title chase, the Trojans likely want Oregon to win, so the Ducks’ resume is as impressive as possible when they visit the Coliseum on Nov. 3 for the most anticipated Pac-12 game of the season.
On the other hand, a victory for Arizona State would the put the Sun Devils squarely in the driver’s seat in the division if they win out, perhaps even allowing them one slip-up if USC suffers another loss in Pac-12 play — a distinct possibility with powerhouse Oregon, dangerous Arizona and rival UCLA still left on the docket.
The Sun Devils’ surprising start under new coach Todd Graham is turning heads, but they have yet to register a signature victory that would convince all pollsters to place them within the top 25, as they are only ranked in one poll: No. 24 in the Coaches’.  Arguably, Arizona State’s most impressive victory so far was a 37-7 shellacking of Utah at home.
Quarterback Taylor Kelly and defensive tackle Will Sutton — two relative unknowns for the Sun Devils entering the year — are both in the thick of the races for Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year, respectively.
Kelly leads the Pac-12 in passing efficiency, throwing for 1,600 yards and 14 touchdowns to just two interceptions. Sutton, though slightly undersized at 6-foot-1 and 267 pounds, has been a revelation, registering 8.5 sacks.
Both teams will look to seize the national spotlight and wrest control of their Pac-12 postseason fates Thursday night.

Following a Thursday night road game at Utah and a trip to the Northwest to take on Washington, No. 10 USC finally returns to the Coliseum on Saturday for a 3 p.m. matchup against Colorado. The Trojans will play three of their next four games at home, a welcome change from their hectic start to the season.
Ripe for success · After running for 204 combined yards against the Huskies last Saturday, USC welcomes a struggling Colorado defense to the Coliseum. The Buffaloes surrender an everage of 181.5 rushing yards per game. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“We’re trying to get into a routine of having normal Saturday games for the next six weeks,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “It feels good to just kind of be on a normal schedule … hopefully we can get a rhythm going.”
The Buffaloes have the worst overall record in the Pac-12 at 1-5, but the Trojans are aware of the need to take their opponent seriously. After a mediocre start to Wednesday’s practice, Kiffin explained how the Trojans could dig themselves into an early hole despite being heavily favored.
“We came out here and didn’t start very well on offense,” Kiffin said. “You start turning the ball over, getting penalties, you let them right into the game. So that’s our focus not to do that.”
The Trojans enter their contest against Colorado with a new emphasis on the ground game. USC accumulated 204 rushing yards against the Huskies and hopes to keep that success going this weekend.
“It was really critical for us to show that we can run the ball for our opponents that we play,” Kiffin said. “To get people at some point to stop spending so much time on [Marqise Lee] and [Robert Woods]. And I think also for your team, it’s a mentality. We don’t ever want to be a team that just throws the ball around, because I think that affects your whole team.”
Colorado has the 84th-ranked ranked run defense in college football, letting up an average of 181.5 yards per game. If USC is able to maintain a balanced attack against the Buffaloes, Kiffin believes his own defense will take care of the rest.
“Most of those teams, if you look around the country, that throw the ball a ton usually don’t have very good defenses,” Kiffin said. “So I think it’s just a product of your team and what you want. We want a physical defense that in practice we can run the ball at and make them really have to hold up. I think that carries over to your entire team.”

I’m going to go out on a limb and say that most children don’t feel comfortable talking to their parents about sex. Sure, there are those lucky few who have a liberal relationship with their cool, hip parents. But most of the time you either keep details about your sex life to yourself or only tell your closest friends. Usually, the sex topic is taboo in the average household.
This is a shame, considering the fact that the topic of sex is one of utmost importance. Such a lack of action taken by parents and their children is just a recipe for disaster.
I personally was lucky enough to have a film buff for a mother, so instead of getting the stringent, awkward birds-and-the-bees talk, I simply watched Titanic at age seven — things became pretty clear to me early on.
But for some, unfortunately, sexual knowledge is relegated to whatever is taught in a fifth grade health class. And though it’s extremely imperative to learn the geography of a vagina or penis (sarcasm — as long as your penis works, I don’t need to know about your vas deferens), it seems as if the most important aspects of sex were always kept off limits — almost as if our teachers and parents were just scratching at the surface, even though we needed to know the emotional side effects of sex as well.
And now here we are: College students at one of the finest universities in the world. If you came to school still harboring questions about the mythical world of sex, chances are they were bluntly addressed within the first few weeks of school.
Yet any confusion could have been avoided if only for a simple talk with your parents pre-departure.
I’m not going to glamorize this armageddon of a discussion: It’s probably going to be awkward. It’s probably going to be one of the most cringe/vomit/cry-inducing episodes you will ever experience. No one, and I mean no one, wants to hear their parents’ thoughts on sex. Parents are supposed to be our teddy bears — completely and totally asexual.
And though it might be difficult to believe, parents usually don’t want to have this conversation with their children. Parents like to think of their children as perennial eight-year-olds: sassy enough to have a funny conversation with, but too young to actually know anything about the world outside of Nickelodeon.
But these attitudes are detrimental to a person’s development. Sex is no small thing and just brushing it under the rug might backfire in the future. Ever heard of the saying “give your child wine at dinner and they won’t grow up to be alcoholics”?
Well, this situation is oddly similar. By discussing — and I mean, actually sitting down to try and attempt a non-awkward discussion — parents can make sure their child is fully educated on all facets of sex.
If families are into abstinence, that’s fine. But talking about things like birth control, condoms and your family’s stance on abortion remain imperative. A lack of education on these topics can cause many problems.
At this point in our lives, asking your parents about sex is probably uncomfortable — mostly because, chances are, you’re actually having sex. But this is an important bandage to rip off. We might enjoy gabbing with our friends about our sex lives, but even the funniest anecdote from them can’t match the wisdom of parental figures — the ones who always have our backs.
This weekend, parents will be flooding campus from across the world, and there’s a high chance that you won’t be getting any. Use this bonding time to gain some knowledge about a topic that you can pretend to know everything about, when in reality, you probably know nothing.
Though it’s uncool to admit it, parents are our biggest resource throughout life. They’ve walked the walk, talked the talk and can offer great advice.
If you’re a male student looking for advice on how to pick up girls or how to bring up sex with someone you’ve just started dating, try talking to a father or another male figure who can relate to you better.
If you need relationship advice, however, you ought to bring your mother in on this one. I’ll be the first to admit that the brain and heart of a girl are complex mazes, and it’s likely woman can help you out of it.
Girls, unfortunately, are still suffering from an extreme case of double standards. We’re supposed to be the docile creatures who wear white on our wedding day, and then magically turn into nymphomaniacs at night.
Many girls probably worry about protection. Though males do a decent job of carrying around condoms, it’s never too much to ask your parents for approval to go on birth control. If you know that they will be extremely hurt, you can always try and take the “I get really bad cramps” route.
And for those who don’t want to have sex, even asking your parents about certain aspects can only help. Questioning if you’re ready or not to take the leap? Unsure of how to tell people that you want to stay a virgin? You can’t ever really know too much: Sex is a constantly evolving part of human existence.
Knowing where everyone in your family stands on the topic of sense will help form your opinions and decisions in the future. So while you might be dreading this conversation, just put it in perspective: It’s much easier to ask for birth control now, rather than to tell your parents that you’re pregnant later.

For two years, documentary filmmakers Bill Yahraus and Robin Rosenthal charted the journey of one Mexican-American horsewomen team on its way to the National Charro Championships.
Ride on · Robin Rosenthal and USC Professor Bill Yahraus team up for their third documentary, Escaramuza: Riding From the Heart. The film follows the Riverside County Charra Team, Las Azaleas (pictured above), on their journey to represent the United States at the National Charro Championships. – | Photo courtesy of Pony Highway Productions
The fact that neither knew anything about the sport or the culture surrounding the escaramuzas charras — a choreographed performance involving horses and background music — when they began filming did not daunt them, according to Yahraus, who teaches film production at USC.
“We make films about things that we are interested in, but we don’t understand,” Yahraus said. “[But] by the end of the film you’ll know a lot about it and a lot about the people who do it because it gets personal.”
Escaramuza: Riding From the Heart follows the Riverside County-based team Las Azaleas, which is striving to do what no other American team has done: get to the congressional national team as they represent the U.S. at the National Charro Championships.
“No American team has [ever] made it to the top 18, so that’s their goal,” Yahraus said. “That’s what we were following them trying to do. It is a lot like getting to the Super Bowl for Mexican sport.”
Rooted in the cattle culture of colonial Mexico, the escaramuzas charras create a kind of horse ballet by performing intricate synchronized patterns at full gallop.
“These are eight girls knocking themselves out,” Yahraus said. “It’s astounding. They do it either in charra suits or adelita dresses and they do it side saddle.”
For the riders, though, Escaramuza is not just about the riding. It’s about carrying on a tradition.
“There’s a subculture called La Charreria, which is a Mexican subculture that goes back generations and generations. It has to do with the way they worked on the farms and the ranches with the horses,” Yahraus said. “They took these aspects of working with horses into various things that happen in the Mexican rodeo.”
Yahraus and Rosenthal’s film shows not only the competitive side of the sport, but also the personal side of the female competitors, Yahraus said.
“These women, they’re bound together by charreria. It’s something they grow up with in this community,” Yahraus said. “The success in the team really keeps them together. They’re partners and it’s their dedication to making that happen which drives this.”
Escaramuza marks Yahraus and Rosenthal’s third documentary film together. Despite their experience with filmmaking, the duo still had challenges to overcome. For Escaramuza, this involved convincing the subjects to continue their daily routines in the presence of a video camera.
“At a certain point you have to convince them you’re not the local news,” Yahraus said. “No matter how much you say, ‘We’re going to stick with you for a season,’ and with them that meant they practiced Tuesdays and Thursdays and a lot of family events which eventually we were invited to, then the competitions around the state. Nobody believes we’re going to stick around at first.”
For Yahraus and Rosenthal, time was the key to building trust with their subjects.
“You just stay and you stay, and you do no harm and you become friends,” Yahraus said. “When we finally came to a practice and no one was wearing makeup we thought, ‘OK that’s good’ and then when people started talking like themselves, we knew we’d gotten beyond the stage where the subject is trying to give you what they think you want.”
The film, which is about friendship, tradition and the art of the sport, also has a soft political side to it, according to Yahraus.
“When I make a film it [deals with] dispelling preconceptions people might have coming to the film,” Yahraus said. “[The Charro riders] are people that were here long before we were, and they’re wonderful, amazingly dedicated, hardworking and [lovely.]  I want that to come across.”
For Rosenthal and Yahraus, the most important thing is finding a subject that is interesting to them, a value that extends to Escaramuza.
“There’s nothing like making films about things that you like, and people you want to be friends with,” Yahraus said. “These people feel like they’re part of this big Mexican-American family … and we will be active with them forever. That’s the beauty of making the film to me.”
For Yahraus and Rosenthal, wrapping up the film was not difficult; the duo knew they would see the team again soon.
“There’s no goodbye,” Yahraus said. “It just takes a different form maybe, but we know they’ll be in our lives forever now.”
 
USC will present a special screening of Escaramuza: Riding From the Heart on Sunday, Nov. 18 at 6 p.m. in The Ray Stark Family Theatre.

When looking back on their younger years, people often tend to recoil in embarrassment over how immature — and even superficial — they might have been (for some, quoting Avril Lavigne lyrics on Facebook originally seemed so profound).
Thankfully, people tend to grow as the years pass, something that MIKA illustrates all too well on his third studio album, The Origin of Love.
The Boy Who Knew Too Much · Lebanese-French-British singer MIKA proves to listeners that he understands mature emotions on his third and highly anticipated album, The Origin of Love. – | Photo courtesy of Girlie Action Media
It’s a heavy title for one album to live up to, but MIKA is not one to shy away from a challenge. After blazing onto the scene with his monstrosity of a freshman album, Life in Cartoon Motion, MIKA followed up the beautiful masterpiece with The Boy Who Knew Too Much. Though a tad less successful commercially, The Boy Who Knew Too Much still showcased MIKA’s incredible songwriting talents.
The Lebanese-French-British singer is no one-trick pony. Writing each lyric, composing each note and even drawing the artwork for his album covers, MIKA is one of the most hands-on artists around. It’s important to keep this in mind while listening to his latest record: If you’ve been with MIKA since his “Grace Kelly” days, then chances are you will be oddly disappointed with his newfound pseudo-synth sound.
That’s not to say that The Origin of Love is bad — in fact, it’s quite the opposite. Alternately operatic, moving and dance-inducing, the album is a triumph. It’s just unfortunate that MIKA had to abandon his previous fun style in order to get there.
Opening with the George Michael-esque “Origin of Love,” the album gets off to an upbeat start. MIKA’s true talent has always been pairing rather depressing lyrics with fun beats and the beginning track is no different.
Lyrics like “Well if God is a priest and the devil is a slut / Well that’s a reason for loving / Like every word that you preach / Like every word that you teach / With every rule that you breach / You know the origin is you” show evidence of the talented singer’s careful consideration. Yet with a fun techno and piano backing, “The Origin of Love” doesn’t feel ridiculous, but fresh.
The album’s next few songs, however, sound oddly alike — a trend not found in MIKA’s older music. Even though the songs are pretty standardized, one cannot complain about their individual quality since they stand well together and on their own.
But the world seems to stop spinning the moment the fourth track, “Make You Happy,” begins to play.  Describing the song as masterful would not be an exaggeration; it’d be rare to find such a masterpiece on any pop album around today.
“Maybe you can’t hear me / But I feel like screaming when you’re near me / Save me from your theories / At the very least just let me cry on you” are lyrics that one usually does not dance to. But again MIKA manages to put together a sense of happiness — the listener doesn’t know whether to cry or dance.
Thankfully, the album isn’t all depressing. MIKA seems to be having the most fun on his Wicked-inspired “Popular Song.” Using the same chorus backing, MIKA changes the lyrics to “I know about popular / It’s not about who you are or your fancy car / You’re only ever who you were / Popular, I know about popular.”
And for those who thought that his spring-released single “Elle Ma Dit” wasn’t going to make it onto the singer’s album, not only does MIKA include the track, but he also wrote an English version titled “Emily.”
The Origin of Love will probably not excite the listener on the first — or even third — listen. Instead, it’s one of those gems that simply sneaks up on you. More than just a collection of songs — refreshing compared to the single-obsessed industry that one is exposed to nowadays — The Origin of Love is the physical manifestation of looking at the big picture. All of the album’s songs, though they might share similarities, deal with largely different topics, but all unite under the main umbrella theme of love.
MIKA certainly provides all facets of the crazy phenomenon known as love. Ranging from adult disapproval of young, idealized visions of love (“Kids”) to hilarious descriptions of love gone wrong (“Love You When I’m Drunk”), the album leaves no stones unturned, no questions left unanswered. The man feels inspired, and he’s going to let the world know.
It’d be surprising if The Origin of Love wasn’t MIKA’s biggest hit to date. By utilizing the ever-so-popular techno style that’s dominated airwaves recently will probably open MIKA up to a whole new audience that had previously scoffed at his high screeches and tunes about made up characters.
This time, however, the only character is MIKA himself. He’s matured, and he’s ready to talk about big boy stuff now.
“All I wanna do is make you happy,” MIKA sings.
On The Origin of Love, MIKA does.
Life in Cartoon Motion is actually my favorite Mika album. It has some of his best songs!!

This question opened the second presidential debate Tuesday night, bringing up a topic that has been largely left at the margins of election season to the very center. Both candidates had an opportunity to take a stand for students and education. But both President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s responses to Adelphi University student Jeremy Epstein’s question were disappointing.
Romney got the floor first and launched into a description of an initiative he launched while governor of Massachusetts — the John and Abigail Adams Scholarship, which provides the top 25 percent of public high school seniors four years of free tuition at any Massachusetts public college or university. No matter your political allegiances, this remains a valuable, laudable public education program.
It’s a great sound bite that demonstrates Romney’s commitment to higher education and one that appeals to student voters. So it makes sense that he referenced it off the bat. What doesn’t make sense, however, is how it would relate to Romney’s potential presidency.
Romney offered no plan to extend the scholarship to other states or transform it into a federal program. During the debate, he jumped to Pell grants — promising to increase them, although his education plan suggests he would reverse the scholarship funding that Obama has doubled during his administration — and then of course, jobs. He said he knows what it takes to create good, college-level jobs again and even told Jeremy: “I’m going to make sure you get a job.” But it’s unclear exactly how he’s going to do that, because he didn’t say.
Obama’s response was equally disappointing. He offered four plans that will ensure college students have a job when they graduate: build more manufacturing jobs, make sure “we have the best education system in the world,” invest in energy and reduce the deficit in the most balanced way possible.
These are all big-picture ways to reassure college students that we’ll enter a stronger economy when we graduate, but they’re more political talking points than genuine student-centric promises.
Interestingly, it took a totally unrelated question to get Obama to really comment on the state of education. He took a question about gun control and turned it into an education issue, saying that beyond gun control policy and regulation, what we really need to do is stop gun violence at its root causes — one of which is failing schools. Though this is the kind of forward thinking we need for true education reform, it shouldn’t take a separate topic to bring it up.
Obama’s record on education hasn’t been perfect, and his opening response to Epstein — and all college students, in a way — was, like Romney’s, not what students needed to hear. With only 18 days left until Election Day, this is crunch time for the candidates to sway undecided voters — many of whom are young people who rallied behind Obama four years ago and are now unsure if they even want to vote. Both candidates are missing out on opportunities to sway a huge voting bloc. Obama and Romney should pay more attention to students and the issues they care about. It sounds trite, but we have to keep saying it until they actually do.

Tuesday’s presidential debate was something of a relief. After a narrow and essentially uninformative first debate, the rematch let President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney talk about a wider array of topics. Questions included Libya, gender inequality in the work place and the chances of college graduates finding jobs.
But where are the questions on campaign finance, Bahrain or voter suppression? There’s something troubling about both debates so far: There are a number of topics that aren’t being discussed.
Take, for instance, climate change. Scientists agree it is happening, and on Wednesday, the world’s largest reinsurer, Munich Re Group, said that climate change contributed to North American national disasters such as Hurricane Katrina. A recent poll from the Pew Research Center showed that only 42 percent of Romney supporters think there is evidence of climate change, compared to 88 percent of Obama. And few from both camps think that people have a hand in it.
So where are the questions on environmental policy? The environment affects not just the economy in terms of green jobs, but also national security and energy resources. Resource scarcity could trigger new conflicts, potentially endangering the United States and other countries across the world.
Or, how about government intrusion into technological issues? This year saw massive disapproval of Internet censorship laws such as the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act. Both candidates talk about innovation, particularly in the digital sector, so why not have them state on the record where they stand on net neutrality and the role of the government in the online world?
It’s not as if technology isn’t a major issue in this country. Government agencies continue to conduct surveillance of American citizens — and they expanded surveillance in 2008. There should be a serious debate on whether or not this is legal or if it violates citizens’ rights. The PATRIOT Act was passed in a wave of post-9/11 fear, but now this sort of secret surveillance is becoming not just policy, but part of the government norm.
Beyond the environment, there’s Citizens United, a current issue that relates directly to the election process itself. The Supreme Court’s 2010 ruling to allow unlimited campaign contributions from corporations and unions has not been brought up, despite the rising amounts of money spent by super PACs for Obama and Romney.
It’s not as if the candidates lack opinions on the issue. During the primaries, Romney infamously said, “Corporations are people too, my friend,” throwing his support behind Citizens United.
On the other hand, Obama is against the ruling. In his Reddit “Ask Me Anything” thread, he said that he supports a constitutional amendment that would overturn Citizens United. That’s a major policy point, but is it being brought up by the candidates or the moderators? No.
Citizens United remains even more significant in this election because it’s being challenged across the country on the state level. In the last week, a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Montana law that bans unlimited contributions in state and local races. And meanwhile, California’s Proposition 32 plans to limit the amount of contributions unions and corporations can give in state races. Citizens United has the Supreme Court’s backing for now, but states are doing what they can to oppose it.
And sadly, it’s unlikely these issues will ever be heard. Monday’s final debate centers on foreign policy: It will most likely focus on Libya, the ongoing war in Afghanistan and the tensions between Israel and Iran. Those are all important topics that deserve the candidates and America’s attention, but a narrow focus on these issues shuts out other topics worth discussing.
There are a lot of issues to discuss in this election, and many are hard to condense into simple answers. But that does not mean they should be ignored in favor of rehashing the same few questions on jobs and healthcare over and over. Debates are public platforms for candidates to discuss what matters to them for the entire country to hear. They should touch on much more than recycled talking points about the same topics.

Nicholas,
Congratulations on shaking the bushes about the large and small issues, substantially ignored.  However as to the issues:
1. Humans are in general short-sighted, good luck on hammering that home to them.
2. Federalism and the Supreme Court:  I think Federalism is much ado regarding the anachronistic.  We need to unite, rather than play at our out-lived tribe mentalities…  But changing that tradition is obviously problematic.
3. Energy and Green energy:  We need smart ubiquitous energy, as that would unite and change the world for the greater good, providing “Communication” on a level playing field.  That would change the world, not like any, leader, politician or potentate ever will.
4. Your thoughtful efforts, we simply need more of – to really change anything!
Well thoughout Article.   Engaging and important.   All the best
Russ

On Sunday evening, music lovers gathered at the Aratani/Japan America Theater in Little Tokyo to hear two legendary musicians discuss the troubled music industry.
David Byrne, who is best known as the co-founder of the legendary avant-garde group Talking Heads, and Trent Reznor, the sole member of multi-platinum act Nine Inch Nails, joined USC’s very own Josh Kun, a professor in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, for an evening devoted to discussing the unique perspectives of the musicians about varied aspects of the music industry.
This conversation was just one of many put on by the Library Foundation of Los Angeles in their ALOUD Lecture Series, dedicated to bringing people at the forefront of arts and humanities, science and politics in a lecture series for L.A. residents. By the end of the evening, the audience had been presented with two unique musicians with very similar viewpoints. Both Byrne and Reznor confirmed the general sentiment one would expect from today’s musicians: Making music is hard, and musicians are not being paid what they deserve.
As each musician recounted their difficulties with record companies and the business facet of music, it became clear that there is still a disconnect between musicians and their fans. As their anecdotes illustrated, musicians are still trying to adapt to fan bases that are hesitant to pay money for music.
Reznor recounted his experiences releasing music online, and giving fans the choice of paying for downloads.
According to Reznor, “only 15 percent of the people that downloaded the album actually paid for it.”
The disappointment and frustration that came with trying to grapple with fans that aren’t willing to pay for music was apparent in Reznor’s voice, as he stated “People are now changing the way they consume music.”
David Byrne also recounted a story about how he tried to research the revenue that one of his singles, “Lazy,” generated on Spotify, an audio stream application.
“After dividing the money among the record company, royalties and the collaborating DJs on the track,” Byrne said, “I made around $40 — that’s enough for lunch for me and a friend.”
One of the biggest surprises of the evening was Reznor’s favorable views toward currently being signed with a record label, given Reznor’s well-known track record of criticizing record label practices.
“It’s nice having a team at Columbia that knows what they’re talking about,” Reznor said. “People that are focused on marketing bands are important because they know what they’re doing.”
David Byrne echoed the sentiment.
“There is a new generation of musicians that are still struggling to solidify their understanding of the music they want to make,” he said. “Musicians that are up and coming seem to prefer a team. It’s too much for a band still figuring out what their music is.”
If Reznor’s and Byrne’s views are indicative of the direction musicians and record labels are heading toward, it might be too early to predict the decline of record labels. Both musicians affirmed the appeal of having a record company behind a newly emerging band, and throughout the evening, it seemed as though Byrne and Reznor were advocating evolution for record companies instead of dissolution.
Toward the end of the discussion, the topic swung over to the personal relationships consumers formed with music, and changes that seemed to be occurring in these relationships. Josh Kun brought up a recent blog post — written by an NPR intern — that detailed the differences between digital music and older platforms, such as CDs. This prompted Reznor to bring up an anecdote about listening to Talking Heads when he was still a kid.
Reznor recalled how he bought an album that Talking Heads had released, and how on his first listen, he had hated it.
“However, since I had actually spent money on this record, I forced myself to listen to the album over and over again,” he said. “An iPod wouldn’t have done that. It would have been just another thing to consume. It would be passively sitting in my iTunes right now.”
Though Reznor admitted he still has trouble with the album, it was by forcing himself to listen to the music that he gained a deep appreciation for what the Talking Heads were creating.
“That album changed the way I now approach music and composition, and has profoundly affected my life,” Reznor said.
Reznor tied together the general mindset of the evening during a question and answer session from the audience. Responding to a question about whether Reznor had ever considered donating some proceeds from his albums to charities, Reznor responded: “The challenge is getting people to pay anything.”
