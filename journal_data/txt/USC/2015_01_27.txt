There are few rappers today who still follow the tenets of early hip-hop.  The old world of simple beats and raw lyrical presence has faded for the most part to give way to heavily produced tracks backed by tech beats and 808 drums. But in New York, old-school is making a resurgence, and leading this movement is Brooklyn native Joey Bada$$. In B4.DA.$$ the 20-year-old rookie raps over soulful beats with a lyrical style that is all his own, creating something reminiscent of hip-hop’s foundation while feeling fresh and new all the same.
“Joey!-Joey!” screams a crowd to open the album, clearly taken from one of his concerts.
“Are y’all ready for Joey Bada$$?” says a hype man before the whole environment fades into trumpets and spoken word.
Bada$$ comes in rapping with articulate precision, a core of his style. When he raps at full speed, it’s a whirlwind; the only things that can stop his highly technical verses are his slow, deliberate choruses that put a strong emphasis on his words.
Bada$$’s sound has strong ties to the old-school style of early hip-hop. In an interview with Time, Bada$$ called the ’90s “the golden age of hip-hop” and said that his intention on B4.DA.$$ was to both pay homage to that period and to reinvigorate the old style. Dropping this album on his 20th birthday, the newcomer was too young to remember the “golden age,” but the influence this era had on New York’s scene inspired him to craft his sound in the same manner.
Bada$$, born Jo-Vaughn Scott, is a first-generation American whose family originated from St. Lucia and Jamaica, and he is quickly creating a name for his family in the states. A few years ago, he formed Pro Era, a rap collective that now has 47 artists ranging from rappers to photographers to producers, and he got the entire group signed to label Cinematic Music. Not only is he making a name for himself, but he is also bringing his friends with him, a noble concept for such a young rapper.
Before transitioning to rapping, the 20-year-old grew up studying acting, which explains the theatrical nature of the space between songs on his album.
Though the spine of Bada$$’s work is old-school, the artist employs new techniques that are becoming commonplace in hip-hop, including sharp pauses, musical breaks and samples. B4.DA.$$ is full of recordings from Bada$$’s own life, such as his mom talking about her concerns with his image, or the crowd cheering that opens the album. This anchors his work in the real world and gives a fresh take on his throwback style.
One track, “Piece of Mind,” opens with a phone call between Bada$$ and an unknown voice, in which Bada$$ tells the man to listen to his new track. This makes the track feel so raw, as if it was just finished and he couldn’t wait to tell the world. Joey Bada$$ is fearlessly himself, and it works heavily in his favor as many artists blend in to the current rap scene with PR teams dictating their every move. While Bada$$’s work sometimes feels unprofessional, as if he recorded it in a living room, the content is so strong that it is barely noticeable. Moreover, it is reminiscent of old-school rap when artists didn’t have the expensive recording techniques of today’s age.
“Money ain’t a thing if I got it,” raps Bada$$ over record scratches on “Paper Trail$,” reflections of a young artist on his way up. He is deliberate and smart, crafting verses that draw upon a wide range of topics, while staying rooted on one main focus for each track. “Paper Trail$” has one line that sums up the whole song: “They say money is the root of all evil. I see money as the root of all people.”
Along the way, he references empanadas, soccer and all kinds of other seemingly random ideas that all play together perfectly to create one coherent song. This is the nature of Joey Bada$$’s work: a mix of ADD and hyper-focus, set over old-school beats with new-school techniques thrown in.
Excluding bonus tracks, the last song, “Curry Chicken,” is a perfect closer. It is slow and honest, featuring an opening from his mother about people doubting the young artist.
“Ever since birth, I knew I would be something on the Earth,” raps Bada$$, and these words ring true as his debut album takes his music to new heights. In terms of unique sound, there is no contest, and I expect to see great things from the young rapper in the coming years.

Though concerts are always an exciting addition to the weekend, the price tag can be prohibitive, as just a few concerts can add up for a student on a budget. Enter Jukely Unlimited, a service that launched last weekend that‘s being pegged as Netflix for concerts. The concept is simple: For a $25 monthly subscription, users can attend as many Jukely Unlimited concerts as they can fit into their schedules. There is a limit of one per day, and you must confirm the concert you want to see by 5 p.m. on the day of the show.
The service was first introduced in New York in October of last year as an extension of the already existing Jukely concert promotion services. “It started as an experiment with a lot of question marks around it,” said co-founder Bora Celik. “I mean, this is a brand new thing that hasn’t been tried before. Some venues have their own membership plans but that is for that venue only. Ours is multiple venues, multiple cities and its going to be multiple countries soon.”
After quickly finding success in New York, co-founders Celik and Andrew Cornett pursued aggressive expansion. Los Angeles, which premiered its Jukely Unlimited service last week, is only the second in what Celik envisions to be a large network of cities. San Francisco is next, with Austin following soon after. One account gives a user access to concerts in any city where Jukely Unlimited operates. Celik envisions a service that facilitates a travel and concert-going experience where users can travel from town to town enjoying concerts at every stop without having to pay for a new ticket every time.
Jukely is negotiating to add more venues, but it already boasts an impressive amount of shows available. Celik stresses that the app will not be aiming to promote the highest profile concerts, however, but rather to be a gateway to the discovery of artists who are on the rise.
“We’re not positioning the unlimited as a cheap way to get into shows that are selling out for real popular artists. The purpose of Jukely unlimited is artist discovery, it’s music discovery, it’s helping emerging artists to find a platform and build up their fan bases in the beginning of their careers, but you’ll also see a lot of quite established artists in there. Our purpose is to introduce people to emerging artists and help emerging artists find a new audience.”
This spirit of exposure to new artists emerges from Jukely’s origins as only a concert promotion service.
Jukely considers itself specially positioned — the first service of its kind — that exposes new artists to eager audiences that normally would not see them because of the prohibitive ticket prices that can accompany even smaller concerts.
“We have this concept of favorite artists where people normally don’t have a lot of favorite artists, so they would only buy tickets to go see their favorite artists and they wouldn’t buy tickets to go see other people, so then they don’t see other artists because they don’t buy tickets,” said Celik. “Our concept breaks that barrier, removes that friction, gets you to be more spontaneous, more adventurous, more experimental and be able to go see a lot of other artists that you wouldn’t normally see and be introduced to them while seeing them live.”
A large part of Jukely Unlimited’s demographic in New York has been students. Celik spoke at length about the importance of young users of the app because of their ability to create an ambiance at the show. “It’s great for students obviously,” said Celik. “Students are on a budget and have more free time on their hands to be able to go to concerts, and promoters love students because they bring fun to the party and really, one of the main reasons membership is a hit among the promoters is not only because it provides them with additional revenue, but more important than that, the success of a show is not just determined by financial gains, it’s determined by the energy the vibe and the memories created by everyone,”
It is this ability to bring in young attendees that has resonated with promoters and has driven them to join in the app and, in turn, has caused it to grow as quickly as it has.
The service still has plenty of room to grow, however. Obviously, the expansion of the app to more cities will be a big leap for the program, but steps still need to be taken in the app department. The unlimited service is not available on the Jukely app just yet, and this is a glaring omission for a service that aims to be mobile. The limit of one concert per day might also be constricting for some. The service is still in its infancy at three-months-old, and the concept is exciting enough that it is sure to be a major hit among students.

It is widely known that USC offers spring semester admissions to students accepted into the university. Before coming to USC in January, these students began their college journey elsewehere and also make fantastic use of their time in place of a fall semester by working and traveling. They’ve declined prestigious admissions offers, including full rides to other institutions to come to this university. They’ve had to watch as their high-school classmates started the college adventure. They’ve explained for countless hours to countless people the enigma of their admissions situation. This process is not exclusive to USC nor is it contained to a small number of students. In fact, many of the brightest, most devoted, and most qualified students to ever come to USC started their formal classes just over two weeks ago. Almost every major is represented in the spring admission class, from history to business to astronautical engineering, just as it is reflected in the undergraduate body at large.
But being smart and committed, however, is just not enough. While it certainly is a privilege to attend this school, some members of our community routinely regard spring admission as lesser. Spring admits themselves often feel as if they are of an “other” sect. Despite the best efforts of the university, they have difficulty finding that school spirit found at the start of a fall. Spring admits don’t get football games, long sunny Los Angeles days or many peers to mingle with.
Many spring admits arrive at USC and discover that cliques have already formed. Additionally, academics can seem overwhelming, with large lectures full of unfamiliar faces. Despite what admissions brochures promise, being a spring admit has a stigma that is difficult to shake. I know this from personal experience.
It took almost a full semester at USC for me to feel fully part of the school and its culture. Today, I was surprised to learn that even USC staff members allow this mindset that to prevail. This afternoon, I had my foreign language class, a break from my heavy science load. Prior to class, I asked a peer about her experience at USC thus far, and I learned that she was having a difficult time finding her place. I assured her that it would come with time, as it had for me a year earlier. At the start of class, an Overseas Studies employee came and spoke about oppurtunities abroad; one of which was a program designed specifically for spring admits. I was shocked to hear him explain that USC has the process in place not to have a critical intellectual mass, but to boost its U.S. News ranking. “Spring admits typically have lower GPAs, but don’t tell them that,” the advisor said with a smile.
As humorous as it might have been to him, I was appalled. As valedictorian of my high school and a class of 2017 spring admit, it was personal. Not only was this a gross oversimplification of deciding who will come in the fall versus the spring, it had nothing to do with abroad studies. So, I spoke up and said, half joking, “That’s not true. I’ve met plenty of dumb fall admits.” Having heard me, the advisor offered a similarly joking half-apology.
Regardless of one’s intention, separative talk dampens spirits and discourages integration. Both fall and spring admits whom I’ve consulted agree: the statement, uttered by a representative of our university, is demeaning and unacceptable.
Simon Gottreich, Sophomore, biochemistry 
The writer is absolutely correct.  USC games the USN&WR stats by admitting Spring admits while trying to convince them that there is just not enough housing, which is an unpersuasive excuse.  For this reason alone, the USC Trustees need to gut the tactic immediately.  Spring admits who are shipped off quietly to Europe like problem children are denied the assimilation process that all freshmen deserve, including beginning the academic year with their classmates, attending USC football games and engaging in other social and academic activities that are critical to the overall collegiate experience.  I place the blame squarely on the senior USC administrators.  USC has also exploded in undergraduate size — from about 15,000 when I was a student in the 1980s to well over 18,000, undeniably diluting the collegiate experience while exacerbating the perennial housing shortage.  USC is fast resembling a large public university in terms of size and the way in which they treat all undergraduates.  And yes, there are far too many transfer students, which alone will prevent USC from entering the “pantheon” of elite universities.  USC never was and should not be considered a “land grant university.”  Some administrators forget that USC is a private school with a high sticker price that warrants special treatment for all admitted students.  The time to end Spring admission is now.
As a spring admit who just got here this January, I am glad to see I’m not the only one who has felt this way. I agree with you that the stigma that comes with Spring Admission is difficult to shake. And although the university tries to create programs to integrate the spring student body into the rest of the population, they do not do such a sufficient job. Many programs separate spring admits from fall admits and it is like we are and always will be referred to differently. And as a freshman, I am not getting the whole dorm room and dining hall experiences which I think would have definitely helped to make friends. Great read I could relate to, Simon.
As a transfer student several years ago (for fall), I felt neither excluded or included at USC. The students and people here weren’t aloof or unfriendly, but they certainly weren’t warm either; I don’t take it personal. You come in as a traditional student i.e. freshmen, then you have the opportunity to experience dorm life; make new friends with your incoming freshmen class; form or be part of your cliques; et al. But as a transfer student, it’s completely different. 
I think as SC’s prestige grows, it should close its door to transfers (yes, I know I sound ironic). The top private schools such as the Ivies and Stanford do this; they highly discourage jr. college or 4-yr. university transfers albeit they’ll make few exceptions. I think it’s because they lack the capacity for it, and I don’t think they want to be bothered by people who “cannot move on from getting rejected from their ‘dream’ or 1st choice universities.” So yeah, I hope SC follows suit. In the bigger picture, though I’m digressing a bit, if SC wants to raise its academic prestige/image, then it needs to stop worrying about winning a popularity contest (seeing how we measure up to UCLA; comparing our admit rates to theirs or other schools; our standing on the USNWR, etc.) Don’t be afraid to reject lots of applicants. Be the “bad guy” for the overall good of the institute. Don’t be soft. 
Two quotes from this piece:
“I’ve met plenty of dumb fall admits.” 
…
“Regardless of one’s intention, separative talk dampens spirits and discourages integration.”
I agree with you for the most part. But this is too ironic.
Great piece Simon. As a sping admit (class of 2014) I can certainly relate. Compounding my situation was my status as a military veteran, if you can imagine that. I would be very interested in research and quantifiable metrics on the subject, as well as a recent survey….food for thought. Fight On!

This Thursday marked the 42nd anniversary of the Supreme Court’s monumental Roe v. Wade decision. The 1973 decision guarantees a woman’s right to abortion until fetus viability, but that didn’t stop the Arizona Rep. Trent Franks from proposing abortion legislation. Though doctors typically consider a fetus viable after 24 weeks, Franks introduced the Pain-Capable Unborn Protection Act, which would ban abortions after 20 week of pregnancy — the point at which, according to the Wall Street Journal, a fetus can supposedly feel pain. If its unwieldy name wasn’t enough, the bill was scheduled by the Republican House of Representatives for voting on Thursday in an aggressive proclamation of GOP values.
Ruthy Sarwal | Daily Trojan
As it turned out, Republican leaders decided to shelf the bill last minute, due in part to the legal grey area surrounding rape and incest. The bill would have allowed abortions after 20 weeks in the case of victims who report sexual abuse to the police, which raises several major issues. For one, the Rape, Incest & Abuse National Network estimates that 68 percent of sexual assault cases are not reported. The exemption of minors who have experienced incest was equally problematic, as Pennsylvania Rep. Charles Dent pointed out in a recent statement, “incest is incest,” regardless of age.
These miscalculations were enough to divide the image-conscious GOP, who cannot afford to alienate female voters so close to the 2016 presidential election, though the bill was unlikely to pass in the first place. A recent White House statement called the Pain-Capable Unborn Protection Act “an assault on a woman’s right to choose.” but the gesture of planning the vote for the anniversary of Roe v. Wade is disturbing. We cannot pretend that women are treated as first-class citizens when abortion restrictions prevail and a woman’s right to choose remains in constant argument. GOP-proposed legislation and the words of conservative activists paint women who seek abortion as liars who murder for the sake of convenience. In order for women to attain equality, people need to raise awareness of the many reasons women choose, and deserve to choose abortion.
For one thing, abortion needs to be considered with context. There is an infinite number of reasons for a woman to choose abortion — expediting a guaranteed stillbirth, preventing parental abuse, pursuing higher education. As Jessica Valenti points out in an article for the Guardian, “The ability to control if and when we parent determines how we participate in society.” It is certainly possible to juggle parenting with a career, but it remains a woman’s right to decide whether or not she’s ready to do so. Valenti cites author Katha Pollitt to introduce the notion that abortion is actually a “public good.” Indeed, “society benefits when women can commit to education and work and dreams without having at the back of her mind that maybe it’s all provisional, because at any moment an accidental pregnancy could derail them for life.” For this reason, abortion should be legalized; it is an essential part of equality.
It is every woman’s right to put her one, existing life before that of an unborn child. Even if a woman decides that abortion violates her personal beliefs, it is no excuse to shame those who cannot afford to put their lives on the line for unwanted pregnancies. Indeed, the exemption requirements of the Pain-Capable Unborn Protection Act perpetuate the notion that women lie about rape to benefit themselves. By requiring that abortions after 20 weeks have a previous police report to back them up, the bill touched on the persisting misconception that many rape claims are illegitimate. This implicit accusation convinced several House Republicans to withdraw their support from the bill, even though Franks insisted that it is not women whom he mistrusts but “unscrupulous abortion providers.” Nevertheless, women like Valenti remain unconvinced. Valenti describes the bill before she retorts that “Republicans know just how much women love to lie about rape and incest to get those sweet, sweet abortions!” She also raises another crucial point about the bill’s treatment of rape, noting that “during a time when sexual assault and the difficulty of reporting it is a central part of the national conversation, forcing women and girls to go to the police before they can access abortion makes Republicans seem even more out of touch with the issues women face than usual.”
Essentially, the Pain-Capable Unborn Protection Act would undo more than a Supreme Court decision; it would mean taking a step backward in the national effort to address sexual assault and half a century backward in the battle for women’s rights. While the bill has been postponed for the time being, it is evident that we have quite a few obstacles ahead of us before we can declare the United States a free nation. Women should not be enslaved to a fetus. Women are people first,  and incubators second — and whether or not a woman chooses to have children. It is nobody else’s business.

Really, women don’t lie when it is in their financial interest? In the military, women can choose to tell the truth about an affair and risk court martial or lie and have no risk. I wonder how many women choose the first option. 
Our culture has created “safe surrender” places for women with unwanted children. Our government takes tax dollars to provide for pregnant women. There are more options for women today than ever before.
 There is not now nor will there ever be equality between any two people of either gender. People are unique. Individuals make choices. No two people have the same resources, experiences or make the same series of choices. Equality is a myth.
Hey Jenn, when you talk about equality, don’t forget the developing child’s equal right to be born.  I bet half of them are female, too.
And 40% of abortions are black babies, even though black people only make up 13% of the entire population.  So there’s a “touch” of flagrant genocidal racism involved as well.
Abortion, as medical necessity to save the mother’s life or other “health” related issues has not really been the issue. The problem with the Pro choice story is that they want to mm use abortion as a means of birth control. It should not be used that way. There are plenty of birth control options available today and have been for over 30 years. The late term abortion legislation must go go to vote and should be law. Abortion is murder anyway, but after 20 weeks, it’s a sadistic action on the part of the mother.
Rape, incest or teenage pregnancis can be dealt with via counseling and then adoption. there are so many couples who want a child but cannot have one on their own so they must adopt, and a lot of them are going outside this country to adopt a a baby.

With about 400 men attending Interfraternity Council rush events each day last week, the executive board set about its task of upholding recruitment guidelines.
Alex Keane, IFC vice-president of recruitment discussed this year’s changes implemented during the recruitment process.
“As IFC, we have to make sure everyone follows the rules and has the most successful rush they can,” Keane said. “The minute we let things get out of control, we don’t have a purpose.”
Common violations, such as having girls or containers of alcohol in the houses, were seen this semester, but no major alcohol-related incidents were reported.
To keep violations under control, IFC Executive Board sends one or two members to patrol rush events on a random basis. There, they check in with the chapter president to answer questions and to make sure that rules are being followed. Each night beginning at 10 p.m., IFC does a walk-through of each house.
“One or two executive members will walk through every corner of the house to make sure there are no girls, alcohol or dirty rush events,” Keane said. “Dirty rushing” refers to when fraternity members coerce potential new members to join the fraternity outside of official rush events. “Going until about 1 a.m., we have people driving around the area to make sure there are no parties or events downtown,” he said.
If IFC finds a violation, the offending member must fill out an incident report to be resolved within the next 24 hours. A judicial board of five chapter presidents meets to review the incident and makes a decision based on IFC regulations and prior cases. Fraternities may appeal the decision within 24 hours.
“We’re really just looking to make the best out of the process for the fraternity, but we just have to enforce the judicial process,” IFC president Jake Simon said. “Some sanctions are capped pledge classes or required workshops for the chapter. It’s more developmental for the fraternity to make sure the violation doesn’t happen again.”
Though the members of IFC have to make sure their own chapters are following guidelines, they say that their position does not compromise them significantly since they are unaffiliated with their fraternities during rush week. They may not wear their letters, attend rush events as members or recruit rushees.
“If you were to find a violation within your own house, you have to report it and have the integrity to do the right thing,” Keane said. “I expressed to all my friends that this is a position I was elected to and that I have a job I have to uphold. Everyone knows this is something I do, so I’ve never had any pushback.”
Keane said he feels that overall this recruitment season went smoothly.
“I think we were very successful; we were very good about finding out when things happened and were fair with the rules we uphold,” Keane said. “We have to represent the best interests of the houses.”

Students and faculty spoke with actor and environmentalist Ed Begley Jr. on Monday evening as part of the Environmental Student Assembly’s first ever #ECOTALKS roundtable discussion.
Fifteen students, including alumni and undergraduates from various majors, attended the event after submitting an online application. Non-student guests included Bonnie Reiss, global director of the Schwarzenegger Institute and former senior advisor to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Central to Begley’s approach to championing environmentalism are highlighting financial incentives for industries, individuals, and in public policy — he likens the forces of social change to a three-legged stool. He cited the Clean Air Act of the 1970s as an example of individuals, government and the automobile industry benefitting from the improvement in air quality through health improvements and adding jobs in greening cars.
“They said we would go broke cleaning up the L.A. air, but we couldn’t afford not to fix the air problem in L.A., the health care costs were too high,” Begley said. “Just sitting down, the air seared your lungs.”
Begley also said he believed that being environmentally friendly is also economically viable.
“I can retire not because of how much money I have but of how little money I need,” Begley said. “My bills are very, very low. I grow food in my backyard, most of my electricity is from the sun, I’m not buying plant food, making my own compost, I’m not buying a lot of produce, I have a low water bill from my rainwater harvest system. Everything I’ve done good for the environment has been good for my pocketbook.”
Students were also interested in motivating the USC administration and student body to take environmental action, an area in which Begley agreed USC lagged behind other universities.
“Show up when they make decisions on these things [such as construction meetings]. Try to get them to do the right thing,” Begley said. “You, as students, have tremendous power.”
He suggested students work on getting the university to agree on a sustainable building policy and on following the UC’s lead on energy reforms on the heels of the UC’s pledge for zero net emissions within the next 10 years.
ESA, which launched in spring of 2014, introduced #ECOTALKS to the USC community to allow students to discuss their concerns with prominent environmentalists in an intimate forum. The Schwarzenegger Institute approached Shawn Rhoads, executive director of ESA, about starting a series of roundtable discussions due to what Reiss said is the Institute’s priority to connect with students.
“ESA wants to try new things, and this roundtable discussion is part of that,” Begley said.

Dean’s Professor of Biological Sciences Peter Kuhn spoke before a packed audience at Joyce J. Cammilleri Hall on Monday. The presentation, titled “Convergence for Better Cures and Better Care,” presented his studies on biological transition points within the field of oncology.
Kuhn’s presentation detailed his “no cell left behind” research, which focuses on unveiling more efficient and personalized methods for cancer treatment.
The discussion featured Kuhn’s findings, which were gathered alongside colleagues from USC’s Bridge Institute. Kuhn described his research processes and his early findings, which facilitate possible cancer treatments for the future.
The USC Bridge Institute is a research facility that was established in 2010. The institute focuses on bringing engineers, scientists and physicians, together to research alternative cancer treatments.
Kuhn, the primary investigator in the project, has also established the translational science program at the Scripps Research Institute and has served on the faculties of medicine and accelerator physics at Stanford University. Along with Provost Professor of Biological Sciences Raymond C. Stevens, Kuhn brings with him a cohort of approximately 50 researchers to the university, whose oncology research will make for a strengthened partnership between the Keck School of Medicine and the Viterbi School of Engineering.
Much of Kuhn’s presentation centered on the theme of convergence in science. Kuhn discussed the aggressive nature of cancer and why cancer treatments must be just as aggressive.
By administering case studies on the progress of cancer patients receiving treatment, Kuhn and his team learned that at biological transition points in the disease, more thoughtful treatment approaches could be considered, perhaps ones that could have salvaged or prolonged a patient’s life.
Kuhn described one case study, in which a 60-year-old man with stage four prostate cancer responded to chemotherapy and a few courses of drugs before his tumors grew rapidly and gained resistance to treatment. Shortly after his cancer stopped responding to drugs, the patient died.
Kuhn followed up to this case study by remarking that doctors of the patient likely believed that they did all that was possible in an effort to save his life. They administered chemotherapy and started him on numerous courses of drugs, but ultimately none of the options worked in the man’s favor. Today, common standards in the medical community reflect the current doctoral perspectives on cancer treatment. Kuhn proposes an alternative plan to cancer treatment.
Kuhn and his colleagues observed that in the case of cancer treatment, determining the following course of action is often done in a way that’s qualitative rather than quantitative. For example, in the case of evaluating metastasis — developments of secondary tumors at locales other than the primary growth of the cancer — doctors can usually chart the areas where a certain tumor has the potential to spread. In the case of prostate cancer, a growth can travel first from the prostate on to the bones, liver or lungs.
Oncologists know the secondary locations that each type of cancer might spread to, but Kuhn suggests that this qualitative information may not be enough. Instead, he demonstrates that it is possible to quantify the likelihood of a tumor taking one trajectory versus another and that by comparing these probabilities, treatments can be further expedited and directed to each patient’s unique condition, a course of individualization that could revolutionize the way physicians approach this disease.
Throughout his lecture, Kuhn emphasized the importance of early detection in cancer treatment by measuring the early detection of the disease or discovering changes in growth or responsiveness throughout the course of treatment.
Kuhn divided the process of treating cancer into two phases.  Phase 1 focuses on “finding the right treatment, for the right patient, at the right time”, while Phase 2 capitalizes on a concept coined “human performance optimization”, or the application of combined and personalized treatment options that will best improve the patient’s outcomes.
Furthermore, Kuhn discussed why quantifiable results for backed treatments must involve a strong team of clinicians, scientists and engineers.
“The clinician identifies the problem and sets boundaries for the solution. Basic scientists achieve meaningful breakthroughs by way of new discoveries,” Kuhn said. “Engineers then provide framework for viable healthcare solutions.”

Veteran political activist and local elected official Gloria Molina met with the Political Students Assembly on Monday night to kick-off the organization’s semester events. Molina represented East Los Angeles on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors for 23 years before being termed out this December.
Molina first entered elected office in 1982 as a State Assembly Member representing what was then the 56th district. In 1987, she was elected to the Los Angeles City Council where she represented District 1, and in 1991, she was elected to Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Molina is the first Latina in history to be elected to the California State Legislature, the Los Angeles City Council and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.
The event was organized by Emily Hodgkins, assistant director of PSA, and Edwin Saucedo, the executive director of PSA.
“She’s a huge legend with great name recognition in the community. We got a lot of support from other student organizations on campus for this event,” said Saucedo.
Molina discussed her experiences in government and in grassroots organizing. Molina became attracted to politics before she was old enough to vote, frustrated by the disenfranchisement and discrimination of those in her community.
Molina was an integral part of the first “Chicana” feminist organization, Comisión Femenil Mexicana Nacional, where she served as president from 1975 to 1977. At the time, Latino rights organizations primarily dealt with discrimination against men, and feminist groups were mostly white. Molina found that dialogue in these types of groups was not inclusive, which prompted the creation of Comisión Femenil Mexicana Nacional. More than 200 women attended the organization’s first meeting, which Molina says, “proved that there was an appetite for discussion about Chicana issues.”
Before being elected to office, Molina served in the White House as a deputy for presidential personnel during Jimmy Carter’s presidency.
During 1980 congressional reapportionment, Molina faced pushback from Democratic party officials who told her that there was no room for a female on the party’s ticket. Soon, after a seat opened in California State Assembly, she entered the race, and despite having fewer financial resources and endorsements than her male competitor, Molina was able to win by rallying women in her community to go to the polls.
“We demonstrated to men in the community that women would succeed if they had the opportunity. Women had the capability of running an effective campaigns… we could raise money and challenge men,” Molina said.
As a State Assembly Member, Molina faced challenges as she fought against the Governor’s plans to build a state prison in her district, which is predominantly Latino. Once elected to Los Angeles City Council, she rallied an organization of concerned citizens called the “Mothers of East LA” to file a successful lawsuit against the prison’s construction, which would have been located in what is now the Arts District.
Molina claimed that the biggest problem she has faced with grassroots organizing is getting people in the community to be responsive.
“To them, you’re just another politician … You have to cut through all of the noise to really reach people. It’s not going to be easy. It’s going to be tough,” she said.
Emily Hodgkins, one of the organizers of Monday night’s event, connected with Molina’s background in grassroots politics.
“It’s particularly exciting to hear about the grassroots activism that [Molina] gave us a look into. We usually don’t see this perspective because ‘big money’ swallows up so much of the media’s attention,” said Hodgkins, a junior majoring in history.
During the event, Molina also addressed the discrimination that she faced while in office.
“If you read articles about me, you will always find an adjective before my name. I’m not the ‘powerful’ supervisor, I’m the ‘shrill’ supervisor. Men can do the same things that I do, but they’re treated differently by the press,” said Molina. “At the end of the day, I was elected to do a job. Not as a woman or as a Latina, but to represent all of my constituents.”
Today, Molina is most proud of her work in combating homelessness in her district. She helped to create the Bell Shelter for homeless veterans in order to surround them by supportive services and mental health resources. During the event, Molina discussed her advocacy on issues such as environmental protection, gerrymandering and education.
Currently, Molina is challenging incumbent Jose Huizar for his seat on the Los Angeles City Council in what is considered to be a highly competitive race. In November, Molina collected over 1600 signatures from 14th Council District to enter the race, rather than paying the race entry fee. The election will take place on March 3rd.
