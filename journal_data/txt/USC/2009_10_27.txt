A handful of student-run emergency medical groups have come and gone at USC, but the latest — Emergency Medical Services of USC — has recently taken steps that could help make it a permanent fixture at the school.
EMSC was started last semester to establish an EMT service for the university community. The program was in the recruiting and planning stages in the spring, but now EMSC boasts 25 trained members who hope to staff athletic events and concerts by next semester.
The organizers of EMSC hope the training sessions the group members participated in this summer will set them apart from previous groups that have attempted to act as an EMT service for the school.
“This has been tried various times in the past,” said Shane Keller, co-founder of EMSC and a senior majoring in neuroscience. “But once we actually went through with the training this summer, the administration knew that we were serious about this. We received their full support and approval as an organization this September.”
The 25 students who participated in the summer training were taught by four instructors from the California Institute of Emergency Medical Training, according to Maya Babla, co-founder of EMSC and a junior majoring in communication and international relations.
Babla said the group also enhanced its relationship with university officials this summer, which she suspects will give EMSC greater staying power than similar groups that have come and gone.
Catherine DeFrancesco, a senior clinical administrator and a member of the group’s professional oversight committee, said the group has the support of Dr. Lawrence Neinstein, the executive director of the University Park Health Center, and others at the health center, as well as USC’s Department of Public Safety. This is the first emergency medical services group, she said, to make such strides toward running a fully functioning service.
“I have been here for 12 years and am aware of two other groups of students that have tried this,” she said. “This is the first time that the requirements necessary for an endeavor of this nature have been fulfilled.”
Babla said having the university’s support is helping the group continue to progress.
“We made huge strides in working with the university administrators to find the right niche for EMSC on campus,” Babla said. “What’s great is that everyone’s on board ­­— not only are the students excited and see a need for this program, but the administration does too, and we’re ready to launch a program that’s here to stay.”
That launch will ideally take place next semester, Babla said.  EMSC expects to have the training and number of people necessary to provide medical services at athletic events, big concerts and other activities on campus.
“We want a program that is comprehensive and affects a lot of students,” Keller said. “Although in the months and years to come, we hope to run a 24-hour [medical emergency] service.”
To start, Babla said, EMSC hopes to staff recreational sporting events, though the group has yet to set any concrete plans.
“Right now we are beginning the process of talking with the departments to make official the events we will volunteer at,” she said.
Though they recognize their plans are ambitious, Babla and Keller said they understand they are laying the foundation for a group that  could make an impact in the future.
“USC does a lot to ensure that we as students are safe, healthy and well, though we found that this specific component [emergency medical care] was missing,” Babla said. “The second component is, in my experience, this university affords us every opportunity to do more, take risks and learn, all with the underlying sentiment of what we can do to give back. I can’t think of a better way to give back than to save lives and provide this type of service.”
Anyone interested in signing up for the EMT class that will be offered at the USC campus over the 2009-2010 winter break please contact EMSCmail@gmail.com for information.

Growing up, most children’s artwork is displayed only on the family refrigerator, never reaching a larger audience.
But the USC Fisher Museum of Art is offering local elementary school kids a chance to see their art displayed without a magnet holding it up.

Fisher has teamed up with the University Neighborhood Outreach Program, the University Village Shopping Center and the Good Neighbors Campaign to launch the Art in the Village program, where students compete to have their artwork displayed in the UV food court.
“When the students excel in this program and gain confidence, it trickles into the other programs and inspires them to do well in other programs,” said Katherine Goar, Fisher’s education and programs coordinator.
The latest Art in the Village exhibit, titled “Color Me…,” opened Tuesday night, and features art from students from all of the USC Family elementary schools. Each piece was completed in only one color but in multiple media.
“Some were really bright yellow with angels and golden halos everywhere, equating yellow with joy,” Goar said.
More than 650 students applied to be featured in the “Color Me…” exhibit. The program, now in its seventh year, has continually received a positive response from parents, students and teachers.
“It’s just one more way to organize and communicate their own ideas,” said fourth-grade teacher Morgan Kapp. “It’s nice to have it be in such a big forum and be able to display their work if it’s selected.”
Hasan Harris, a fourth grader at the Dr. Theodore T. Alexander Science Center School and a previous winner, said the program made him feel special.
“It made me excited because I can draw good,” he said. “I have worked with more art after I was finished with my work and artwork.”
Harris created what he calls an “evil mad scientist” for the “If I Were a Scientist” exhibit last year.
The program began when the university, the Fisher Museum and members of the community noticed a lack of art in local schools. They decided to band together to increase the attention given to students for their artwork.
“It’s one thing to do art in the classroom and your parents hang it on the fridge, and it’s another thing to have a museum hang it on their walls or in a professional exhibition for the public to see,” Goar said.
Beyond education and recognition, Goar said the program gives children an outlet they are often denied.
“[The program is a] really great way for kids who are often struggling with big issues in their lives,” Goar said. “I’m always so inspired and amazed when I go through the individual pieces of art … [they] give you a window into the lives of these children and what they are thinking. It’s really important and we have to do that more often.”
The program runs on a $25,999 budget paid through the University Network Outreach Program, which solicits the staff and faculty at the university to donate a portion of their salaries.
Currently, the program puts on four yearly exhibits. “Color Me…” will be on display until Dec. 4 and the next exhibit begins on Dec. 8.

USC deans, professors and faculty traveled to Taipei, Taiwan this week to meet with USC alumni from across Asia and discuss global issues at the three-day USC Global Conference, which begins Thursday.
The Global Conference, organized by the USC Office of Globalization, is held in a different part of Asia every other year and consists of three days of speeches and panel discussions about issues including health, energy, business and digital media.
“It’s all intertwined,” said Adam Powell, the USC vice provost for globalization and this year’s emcee for the conference. “The discussions are interdisciplinary.”
The conference acts as a showcase for the latest work from USC’s faculty and researchers, as well as a networking forum for alumni in Asia.
One of the main goals of the event is something that Powell calls “friend raising” — strengthening ties among the Trojan Family as well as building relationships with people from the country where the conference is being held.
“USC wants to reach out with its alumni, so we’re looking for the topics that will be important to them,” said Dr. Jonathan Samet, the director of USC Institute for Global Health, who will be one of the speakers at the Global Conference. “We want to engage the alumni and others in something that will make a difference.”
According to Powell, the conference is also a useful opportunity for the university to build contacts in the region.
“[We get] more research partnerships, opportunities for student internships in Asia, and greater activity overall,” Powell said. “We’re connecting with partners in different universities, government, industry, and we’re increasing opportunities in internships.”
The Global Conference was first held nine years ago in Hong Kong as a Marshall School reunion. Since then, it has developed and grown into a gathering for all of USC’s schools.
“We wanted to make it more of a platform for USC to do its best, and to do that we had to make it interdisciplinary,” Powell said.
The conference is always held in Asia, demonstrating the university’s commitment to the region, said Jeffrey Cole, the director of USC’s Center for the Digital Future.
“The future rests strongly on Asia, and this is an opportunity for USC to showcase cutting-edge work done on its campus,” said Cole, who is a speaker at the conference.
As part of the conference, Samet will be leading a discussion on global health issues focusing on global epidemics from H1N1 to SARS. Cole plans to speak about the changes coming from traditional media and the future of music, newspapers and television.
Other panels, which draw from speakers across the region as well as USC deans and faculty, will touch on topics including the changing economic climate and the global outlook for energy.
The event is entirely set up by USC, drawing on organization from a number of USC offices, including the USC office in Taipei, and is primarily attended by alumni in the region.
“Each of the individuals coming pays hundreds just to register,” Powell said. “USC doesn’t make any money, but they only lose a little. Attendance is so good this year we might not lose anything.”
Powell said more than 600 people were willing to pay for registration and hotel fares for this year’s conference, up from the 450 who attended in 2007. The uptick has caused organizers to consider looking for a larger venue for future conferences.
“It’s been quite a surprise, especially because of the global economy. We expected it to go down… Alumni are simply coming out in larger numbers,” Powell said. “It’s proven more successful than anyone imagined.”
According to Clayton Dube, the associate director of the USC US-China Institute, the record attendance may be partly due to the fact that the region is the home to the largest percentage of USC’s current foreign students. Currently, 1,187 students from China, 625 students from Taiwan and 244 students from Hong Kong and Macau attend USC.
Cole said the conference is ultimately more than just a get-together for alumni and Asian leaders.
“The Global Conference energizes the USC community,” Cole said. “It demonstrates that USC isn’t just a school. It has become a global entity.”

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate passed two measures Tuesday night, unanimously approving the allocated extraordinary funding budget and a resolution to add a list of two-unit courses to USC’s online Schedule of Classes.
The extraordinary funding budget amounts to $70,565 this year and comes from the student programming fees left over after USG officials initially outlined their annual budget.
Every year, USG allocates funds to its various committees based on the programming fees projected to come from 15,000 students.
Since approximately 16,000 students usually end up attending USC, the amount of extra funds available remains virtually the same from year to year, USG Treasurer Ashwin Appiah said.
Programming Board is receiving the majority of the available extraordinary funding, but every committee seeking a boost to its budget will only have part of its request met since the extraordinary funding budget is not large enough to fully fund every assembly.
“We decreased [the requested amount of funding] by 40 percent all around just so it was fair,” said Joseph Zuniga, executive director of Program Board.
The addition of a list of available two-unit courses to USC’s online Schedule of Classes will help students take advantage of those extra, often neglected two units in their course plans every semester, said Andrew Matson, USG’s director of academic affairs. Many students want to take two-unit courses but say they lack a sufficient resource to find a class that interests them, Matson added.
The addition of a two-unit course list is expected to appear in the Schedule of Classes by fall 2010, Matson said.

You can see them every Friday night under the Cromwell Field lights anytime from 6 p.m. to 11:00. Upon first glance, you guess that they’re a group of baseball players barred from playing on Dedeaux Field.
However, a second glance yields a different impression. You notice the batter wields a large, flat paddle — strikingly similar to those used in the freshmen hazing rituals in Dazed and Confused.
New direction · The USC cricket team, which has been in existence for 10 years, suffered through numerous losing seasons before getting serious last season. The team is now one of the best in its region. - Photo courtesy of USC cricket team
The pitcher, or bowler, donning the typical polo shirt, almost sprints before releasing the ball, in sharp contrast to a baseball pitcher who must always maintain contact with the mound’s rubber.
Thoroughly intrigued at this point, you approach the fence and begin to watch the match. You may realize the sport is cricket but you might be hard pressed to understand exactly what’s going on in the sport that is foreign to most American eyes.
The USC cricket club has become one of the most successful and underappreciated teams on campus these days. Ranked No. 1 in the Southern California League, the team has played in relative obscurity for the past nine years.
For most of these years, the team finished in last place. However, after an upheaval of the program last year and a new infusion of dedicated talent, the team has risen in status.
“This club was always run on leisure time. No one was doing anything about it,” said Tarun Sandhu, the club president. “So, we rebuilt it from scratch. Now, we no longer have an unorganized club.”
With a 10-2 record, USC cricket is making its case for a promotion to Division II as soon as next year.
This team represents the diversity of the USC student body. The 26 players who comprise the team hail from the United States, India, Pakistan, England and New Zealand. Graduate students make up 75 percent of the team.
Next spring, USC Cricket will be attending the American College Cricket Championship in Florida to compete against other top collegiate teams. Shivnarine Chanderpaul, widely acclaimed as the world’s best batsmen, will be in attendance to present the winning trophy, named in his honor.
When asked how he expects his team to fare at the tournament, Sandhu was confident.
“We are pretty optimistic about our chances of winning the championship,” he said. “The reason I would say that is because of the talent, dedication and, most of all, the team spirit that we bring to the game.
“Cricket is about 11 guys who give their best to the winning cause, and I feel that our team, if it continues with the good form that we have shown this past season, will be in a good position to win games and dominate the tournament,” Sandhu said.
Sandhu expects cricket to increase greatly in popularity over the next decade, especially in the United States. The International Olympic Committee is currently deliberating on whether to include cricket in the 2020 Summer Olympic games. If accepted, arguably the second most popular sport in the world — ranking only behind soccer — will likely gain more exposure in the United States.
In the meantime, the club continues to organize cricket clinics designed to instruct people how to play. Although one has already been held, the club intends to organize more before the semester ends.
Sandhu has a greater vision for the team beyond just this year, however.
“We want to take cricket to the professional level here at USC, and hopefully as and when the sport gets NCAA recognition, we aim to bring home nothing less than the championship trophy,” he said.
It’s great to see another team enter this tournament.  Observing from Australia, it seems that the USA cricket association is still being run like an old school English cricket club, full of feelings of entitlement and nepotism (I’m not entirely sure about the degree of nepotism in USA cricket).  Hopefully, within a few years, the college cricket system will have advanced to the point that it is the leading source for players to go on to the national team.  Good luck in Florida.

Autzen Stadium fits only 50,000 people, but it’s consistently been known to be the loudest in the Pac-10.
And when USC visits Oregon Saturday — on Halloween night, nonetheless — it will be loud.
Very loud.
Above the noise · Freshman quarterback Matt Barkley has had plenty of experience in front of big crowds, keeping his cool in Ohio Stadium and again in Notre Dame Stadium. Oregon presents another challenge. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
“It really is a great crowd,” USC coach Pete Carroll said at his Tuesday press conference. “They are very outspoken and all that, and, of course, they do a great job of orchestrating the game environment.”
And therein lies the challenge the Trojans will face Saturday. They must take on both No. 10 Oregon and the fans in attendance at Autzen Stadium.
“It’s just going to be a matter of going into Autzen and drowning the crowd out and executing,” redshirt sophomore linebacker Chris Galippo said after practice Tuesday.
USC has had three road games this season in what are commonly deemed tough places to play because of noise: Ohio Stadium, Husky Stadium and Notre Dame Stadium.
Of course, one of those matchups didn’t end so well for the Trojans — the 16-13 loss to Washington in September.
Still, the experience is a positive, the team said.
“It definitely helps, just with knowing which type of crowds you’re gonna face and the crowd noise, and the atmosphere and the energy,” freshman quarterback Matt Barkley said. “You know what to expect, but I don’t think I need any preparation to know what we’re gonna face.
“We’re just going to focus on ourselves and what we do and I think that should be good enough to win.”
u
Missing from practice Tuesday because of injury were five of Barkley’s key offensive targets: junior receivers David Ausberry and Damian Williams, junior fullback Stanley Havili, senior tight end Anthony McCoy and redshirt freshman receiver Brice Butler.
None of the injuries are believed to be serious, but together, the five represent more than 70 percent of USC receptions up to this point.
Both Carroll and offensive coordinator John Morton said they are not worried.
“We’ve got guys ready to play,” Carroll said. “As always, it’s about the guys who will step up for us, not the guys who are out.”
Havili and Ausberry missed the Oregon State game. Havili, who dislocated his shoulder late in the Notre Dame game, but returned to play in the fourth quarter, has practiced briefly this week.
Ausberry underwent an MRI on his strained calf and wasn’t present at Howard Jones Field Tuesday. There is no prognosis yet for his return.
McCoy is still considered day-to-day with a boot on his sprained ankle.
“It’s a big deal to lose Anthony,” Carroll said. “He’s been a big factor in these games, and hopefully he’ll be able to make it. We won’t know until the end of the week.”
Williams sat out with a bruised gluteus maximus and Butler with a sore back. Both are expected to return to the practice field Wednesday.

The sun shines bright and high in the sky as the galloping horse approaches. The rider is calm and in control, as if she is one with the horse.
The horse’s hooves beat against the ground, throwing up dirt as it approaches the obstacle ahead. The majestic beast and rider at the rein are lifted into the air in the next moment, almost like in a scene from an old Western movie. This is just one of many scenes from a day of practice for the USC equestrian team.

The equestrian team first got started in the early 1980s but did not last. The club was reignited four years ago and has been on the rise since then; the team continued to excel and recently made it to nationals last season, though it remains under the shadow of other USC athletic clubs.
Coach Karen Perlow made her expectations of the team quite clear this year.
“Our goals for this year are to qualify as a team and individual division riders for the 2010 National Finals,” Perlow said.
Like any other team, the desire to be number one is always a driving factor. For the USC equestrian team, the desire is reflected already at the start of the season.
“We had our first show in San Diego on Oct. 10 and 11. The team was the overall high point champion both show days and is leading the region by 19 points. We have started the season better than ever,” Perlow said.
The team is on track to breeze through the season and to nationals.
“We have a lot of good riders and are definitely going to be a threat to not only the West Coast teams but those from the East Coast as well,” captain Annie Grove said.
Despite the positive attitude and hard work, the team still faces potential setbacks; financial obstacles are always the hardest of all hurdles for the team to overcome.
“It’s a very expensive sport,” Co-president Katherine Buckley said.
The total costs for the team, according to Buckley, can exceed $200,000. For this reason alone, a lot of effort is put into fundrasing.
The university gives each sports club a certain amount of money each year, which Buckley estimates to be around $4,000. But it is not enough for the team to continue to operate.
Because of these financial setbacks, the team is limited to one practice a week, which also limits the amount of available horses for the riders.
“Because we only practice once a week it is really important to work hard during your ride,” Grove said.
Despite the limited time, the team continues to improve.
“I have riders on all levels that are extremely talented and competitive,” Perlow said. “The weakness is the lack of support to make this program stronger and more productive. I want my riders to be more physically fit and ready to challenge the best teams at the national finals.”
The club still finds time to exercise its humanitarian side off the field as well.
“The members have spent countless hours and weekends helping and being a support group to the Compton Jr. Posse … a program to keep kids off the streets and on horses,” Perlow said.
The team has been working with the Compton Jr. Posse in order to achieve one of coach Perlow’s goals of not only striving athletically, but also giving back to the community.
The USC equestrian team has its eyes set on the No. 1 spot at Nationals and coach Perlow predicts being No. 1 in its region. While it is still too early in the season to know for sure whether these predictions will come to pass, the team’s determination in the face of adversity is enough to make believers out of most.
This article states that the USC Equestrian team disappeared between the 1980s and 2005, but this is not correct.  The team existed consistently since the 1980s, and in 1991 or 1992, riders from USC went to Nationals.  Also, while the team may not have been as strong as it is now, it definitely existed during the time I went to USC from 2002-2006.  Please make sure to verify your facts before publishing articles.  Thank you.

USC outside hitter Jessica Gysin is 23 now, a sixth-year senior working on her master’s degree in political science.
It’s been a long road to this point in her career, so let’s recap.
Seasoned veteran · USC senior outside hitter Jessica Gysin has assumed the role of leader for the Women of Troy. Now in her sixth year, Gysin had to overcome early injuries, but remains one of the nation’s top players. - Ian Elston | Daily Trojan
She was a highly touted recruit coming into USC, garnering such honors as Gatorade State Player of the Year, Volleyball Magazine’s National Player of the Year and CIF state championship MVP — twice — at St. Francis High in Los Gatos, Calif.
And then, in her first week of practice with the Women of Troy in 2004, Gysin suffered a severe left ankle sprain, sidelining her for roughly six weeks.
In her first match back, she aggravated the injury and her freshman season was over.
The next summer, she tore her left anterior cruciate ligament. Her second year: kaput.
An ACL tear — especially for a volleyball player that relies so heavily on jumping and explosions of agility — can be career-ending.
But not to Gysin, who fought back and returned the next season to start as outside hitter for a Women of Troy team that went 27-5 and lasted until the regional semifinals of the NCAA tournament.
“You know how they say, ‘What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger?’” said Karen Gysin, Jessica’s mother and a former collegiate volleyball player herself. “Well, she became so much stronger.”
Mom’s right.
Her daughter is now a certifiable weapon as a 6-foot-1 dynamo from the outside for the Women of Troy. She’s averaging 3.5 kills per set this season, good for second on the team behind sophomore sensation Alex Jupiter.
But more important for the team is her leadership role. Gysin is the team captain, and players and coaches alike describe her as a facilitator extraordinaire.
“Certainly the injuries were devastating,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “Most people would have gone under with injuries like that, but she’s really a fighter.
“But the biggest thing with her — even bigger than the injuries — is learning how to lead.”
When Haley talks to his team in a huddle at the end of practice, Gysin’s always in the middle of it.
When there’s a key play on the court — one of those back-and-forth rallies that gets the crowd roaring — Gysin’s always in the middle of it.
When the players on the court regroup after a frustrating point in a match, Gysin’s always in the middle, providing encouragement.
There’s a trend going on. The Women of Troy count on Gysin to be their backbone. And she’s done it, consistently.
“She’s done a pretty magnificent job of holding us together and helping us grow,” Haley said. “And she’s still been able to maintain her game as well.”
Gysin has been the eldest player on the team since her sophomore season — believe it or not.
And the experience shows.
“It’s allowed our young kids to grow up faster,” Haley said. “Last year she was still coming into her own as a leader, but this year she’s taken a greater role in stabilizing everybody.”
And that role was fostered during those two years Gysin spent in volleyball exile, forced to sit on the sidelines and watch volleyball from a different perspective.
“I learned how to be a leader through watching the older players go through it,” Gysin said. “Leadership is one of the most important skills you can have, and now that I’m older, I’m the team leader.”
The Women of Troy are going to need it.
Ranked No. 16 in the nation, the Women of Troy will play two top-20 teams this weekend at No. 4 Stanford and No. 14 Cal.
The weekend could make or break this year for USC. The first two months of the season have been up and down in the truest sense of the phrase.
The Women of Troy won 11 of their first 12 matches. Then they lost five of their next seven. But against the Oregon schools last weekend, USC dominated, sweeping all six sets and gaining momentum for this weekend.
Their success starts with Gysin, but it’s not all about her — not at all.
Senior libero Alli Hillgren’s been a leader in her own right.
Sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter is averaging more than five kills a set during conference play — a ridiculous number.
And with sophomore Lauren Williams and junior Audrey Eichler growing into their own at the middle blocker position, there’s reason to believe this team can make an NCAA run.
“It’s been dynamic to have our sophomores doing so well, but the reason is Gysin and Hillgren’s senior leadership,” Haley said. “That allows the sophomores to really start to come on and a postseason run to maybe become a reality.”
Gysin is the elder stateswoman of the Women of Troy. More than two years older than anyone else on the team, she’ll turn 24 during postseason play.
But that age — and the experience that comes with it — has given her a unique perspective. Call it whatever you want to call it: more volleyball experience, a more mature outlook or simply just being older.
“She’s an old lady,” her mother jokingly quips.
If you say so. But a darn athletic one.

When the ancient indigenous people of Mesoamerica disappeared, many of their old rituals and beliefs were gone forever. Perhaps it is not a coincidence, then, that one of the few surviving rituals is a celebration that honors and remembers the departed: El Dia de los Muertos, or The Day of the Dead.
A ceremony that has continued for hundreds of years, Dia de los Muertos is observed in countries around the world. In Los Angeles, the holiday is recognized on both large and small scales. Now in its 10th year, the annual celebration at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, which took place on Saturday, remains one of the most extravagant, widely attended Dia de los Muertos events in the city.
Momentos · Observers of Dia de los Muertos craft altars with marigolds, sugar skulls and photos for loved ones. - Amaresh Sundaram Kuppuswamy | Daily Trojan
Event tickets cost $10, and a long line snaked along the lawn just outside the cemetery’s main gate before 4 p.m. By 9 p.m. the line stretched for several blocks along Santa Monica Boulevard. With Los Angeles’ large Latino population, it is not surprising that more than 20,000 attended the cemetery.
Only a handful of people were dressed in full Halloween costumes, but many wore elaborate skull face paint. Skeletons, called calacas, are a prominent symbol of the holiday.
“The calacas are about celebrating the dead — they are positive representations of it,” said Guillermo Reyes, an event contributor.
Upon entering the cemetery, guests were greeted by a ritual blessing and Oaxacan burial performed by men and women dressed in ancient Aztec attire, pounding drums and chanting much as it would have appeared hundreds of years ago. The dark lawn and countless tombstones certainly added to the authenticity of honoring the deceased.
Throughout the night, there was a variety of cultural art and music performances, but by far the most notable feature was the procession of more than 150 altars — a staple of the holiday. The altars, or ofrenas, present at the cemetery are “tributes to the dead,” according participant Bobbie Garcia.
“They are made of four tiers, symbols of water, earth, air and fire,” Garcia explained.
Pan de muerto, or bread of the dead, sugar skulls, photographs and alcohol are among the objects placed as ornaments on the altars, while orange marigold flowers and incense are commonly added because spirits are said to be attracted to their distinct scent.
Though most altars contained flowers, food and candles — which are considered standard decorations — there was an incredible amount of diversity in the size and design of the altars. Each altar was garnished with a blend of colors and frequently decked out with vibrant images or photos. One even contained In-n-Out bags because the deceased individual loved the restaurant.
“Traditionally, people begin decorating at noon or the night before,” Reyes said.
The Hollywood Forever Cemetery event was both a very personal and public display of paying respect to the dead. Some entrants used their altars as a message, such as commemorating the US troops who recently lost their lives overseas, whereas others used them to share stories about their family members.
“[It’s about] remembering what people did in their lives, not mourning their passing,” Bobbie said.
Each was unique, such as the “St. Patrick’s Day of the Dead” altar, which instantly stood out with its green Irish theme, electronic gadgets and voice recordings playing from a papier-mâché body set in an open coffin. Valeria Campbell, creator of the altar, explained it was meant to honor her father, Patrick Manahan, an accountant who loved to record whatever he said and was nicknamed “St. Patty” for being so religious.
Another altar, “Nuestra Señora de los Gatos: Patron Saint of All Abandoned, Relinquished, and Homeless Pets,” was decorated with cut out boards of pink cats. A señora  skeleton in a purple dress is the mythical figure imagined by participant David Warner and his wife.
“It’s a tribute to lost pets displaced from disasters like [Hurricane] Katrina and the people taking time to help them,” Warner said.
Beyond the procession of altars were arts and crafts vendors, such as free face-painting booths and Braceland Bones, which sold skeleton-themed artwork and sketches. The Cathedral Mausoleum was filled with people admiring paintings and artwork along with orchestral background music.
One of the major highlights of the event was Latin Grammy award winner Lila Downs, singing at the Muerte Y Tradicion Stage, which was adorned with multicolored skulls.
The event has only expanded and encompassed more diversity throughout its 10 years.
“I’ve seen it grow over the years,” Reyes said. “There’s more cross-culture now to enrich the festival.”
For those who missed Saturday’s event, the Hollywood Forever Cemetery continues the celebration on Nov. 1 with a more intimate Dia de los Muertos night that will explore the holiday’s myths and history.
si i remember Dia de los muertos.  I always used to get  those yummy candy skulls.  my sister passed and she loved soccer so we put her favorite soccer ball by her grave! its my favorite holiday in mexico!!
El dia de los muertos is a very important event in the mexican tradition.  I am a mexican and every dia de los muertos we get together with our family members and go to the cementary to give the dead our respects and remember them.  We celebrate their lives and remember the good old times.  I would like to attend this event because it sounds like something really fun and like it would really be remembering the dead.  I have a friend that has actually attended one of these in mexico and she says that it is amazing because you get candy skulls. She said that they also take their loved ones their favorite food or mole.  Mole is the traditional food of the dead.
I remeber going to El Dia de los Muertos in Mexico, It was fun since, we would go the cementary and take food for the dead. Their would usually be people selling candy skeletons and candy food baskets. El dia de los muertos brings back memories.

So tell me: Why was the skeleton afraid to cross the road?
I must have used this joke at least 30 times each year to get my precious, long-awaited candy. Nearly every person who opened their doors demanded a joke before allowing me a handful of sweets and, loving the sudden spotlight as a comedian, I happily obliged. With every doorbell, it was a broken record: Why was the skeleton afraid to cross the road?
It had no guts!
Halloween is a time for cavities, pumpkin carving and elaborate costumes, but, even more so than any of these things, it is a time for newfound confidence. There’s just something about hiding behind a mask, donning a disguise or fitting into spandex that restacks the nerves in one’s spine. Pretending that you are somebody else? Instant confidence-booster.
Halloween costumes represent a number of things. Sometimes, they’re simply original and witty ideas crafted into reality. Sometimes, they are created only to incite incredulous shock and subsequent giggles. I have found that the majority of the time, however, they are projections — images of personas that people either secretly identify with or wish they could identify with.
It all began when we were first introduced to the art of trick or treating. The true conceptualization of Halloween costumes can only begin with careful thought and deliberate choice. When we were younger, Halloween costumes were treated like prom dresses — even though you bought it off the shelf at a local store, you still expected it to be the only one of its kind that night. We were a collection of Disney princesses, Power Rangers and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
We wanted to be unique and yet, at the same time, we wanted to transform into the very role models that our entire generation loved and adored.
Kids will act differently on Halloween than they do without the masks and costumes. Case in point: I was probably the most timid little girl you would have ever met. Blame it on my acquisition of English as a second language or the fact that I entered the first day of my new elementary school with chicken pox scars and never managed to detach myself from embarrassing nicknames, but I was never the first to speak — and I certainly would never deliberately crack a joke with a stranger. But as the Yellow Power Ranger? Oh, I was no longer the scar-ridden little girl I saw in the mirror — I was powerful, vivacious and, if I could save the world with one karate chop, I could certainly deliver a cheesy punch line.
Now that we have grown older, little has changed. We still act differently on Halloween than on any other typical day: We raise our hems a few inches, bare our cleavage for the world to see and overindulge in candy that comes in red plastic cups. I have seen shy, hesitant girls dressed as Batman’s feline foe unabashedly shake their booty on the dance floor (Catwoman, after all, is a jungle cat filled with flexible prowess).
I have also seen really nice guys, overwhelmed by the flashing skirts surrounding them, lose all sense of chivalry and dignity. Some people may criticize Halloween as a night of slutty debauchery, but I disagree. It’s simply a night for people to unwind, unleash and let the disguises reveal hidden facets of their personality.
But there’s a catch I find in all of these costumed revelations. Sure, kids and college students break out of their shells on the night that ghosts and werewolves roam the streets — but is this confidence in any way tangible or durable? I repeatedly perfected a punch line to stranger after stranger but, at every house, could never bring myself to knock on the door itself.
I similarly see fellow students throw their inhibitions and self-consciousness to the winds — but, in order to do so, they crawl into costumes that are saturated with the very inhibitions and self-consciousness they hope to ignore.
So yes, Halloween is a night (and sometimes a morning after) of crazy adventures spotlighting other secret, hidden parts of your soul begging to make its mark on the world.
But, when it comes down to it, where are the guts? Bared proudly in a costume or hidden somewhere beneath that spandex, shielded and dismissed from view?
We’ve all heard it a thousand times, but tell it to me again: Why was the skeleton afraid to cross the road?

There are only so many ’80s-themed parties one can attend before American Apparel runs out of gold lamé spandex pants and shoulder pads stop being ironically funny and start being a regrettable fashion statement.
It’s only natural that students start branching out to new theme party ideas, but it’s not long before everyone and their mother has been to a golf bros and tennis hos party, a white trash party, a mustache party, a highlighter party and a Nickelodeon party. And you know your party is mainstream if your mother has the same “Doug Funny as Quailman” costume as you.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
More original ideas are necessarily sought, but there are only so many different themes that you can put “bros and hos” in front of before they start becoming esoteric. Generally, the themes “Penguins and flaming-os,” “Puritan Bros and Quaker Hos,” “Moby Dicks and Mrs. Dalloway Chicks” and “Magician Bros and Assistant Hos” tested poorly in focus groups.
But fear not; it is unlikely that the next Facebook event invite you receive will be for a party themed “Sloppy Joes and Barbeque Hos,” though it would be great to finally put that bikini made out of hamburger patties to use.
It turns out that the latest cool party to throw is a swine flu party.
At first, this idea seems to make little sense because there is nothing less conducive to drinking than surgical masks (unless you are drinking Natural Light).
After a second glance, though, this idea makes even less sense.
Swine flu parties are a rumored and perhaps mythical phenomena, which exist concretely only in the realms of Internet discussion boards.
At a swine flu party, one guest has the H1N1 virus and the rest of the guests show up to expose themselves to the virus, and to enjoy beverages and cocktail weenies in the meantime. The reasoning behind this seemingly wanton recklessness is that the exposure to the not-necessarily deadly H1N1 virus will provide immunity for a later and potentially more dangerous strain of the virus.
According to The New York Times, this “vigilante vaccination” isn’t completely devoid of sense. It’s not unheard of for parents to purposely expose their children to chicken pox so they can avoid it later in life. Similarly, when the 1918 flu pandemic swept the world, some papers reported that patients exposed to the earliest strain of the virus were less likely to die later on.
Still, the consensus of the Center for Disease Control is that a swine flu party is “certainly … something that we would highly recommend not happen.” Or as a flu specialist interviewed in The Times put it, “totally nuts.”
The swine flu virus is still too unknown to make willful exposure to the virus a wise idea. It is the medical equivalent of marrying your high school sweetheart who looks like a yeti because you’re not sure who else is out there; but, sometimes it’s better to face uncertainty than to marry a yeti.
So if you receive an invitation for a swine flu party, your best bet is to put away your “slutty scrubs” and platformed surgical booties and consider going to that “Rakes and Hoes” party — American Apparel just started carrying gardening clogs!

A large tree on the north side of Bovard Auditorium came toppling down this afternoon, blown over by the high winds.
According to Dept. of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle, a couple of other trees are down elsewhere on campus and one tree by Hedco Neuroscience Building and The Lot is leaning.  DPS officers are monitoring the area.
USC facilities management is currently working to remove the fallen trees and is also trying to stabilize the leaning tree.
So far there have been no injuries and no structural damage has been reported, Carlisle said, but with winds as a high as 50 mph, DPS is urging students to exercise caution.
The high winds have also resulted in power outages around campus, including in the area of 24th and Hoover streets.

Standing proud in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles, USC boasts top-rated academic programs, a football team that seizes Rose Bowl titles and a student body that is active in more than 260 university-sponsored community service programs. Not to mention those “A” rankings for our drool-worthy dudes and gorgeous girls, according to College Prowler.
The responsibility of maintaining USC’s celebrated image starts with double-checking the messages that we, undergraduate students, are sending into the public sphere for our friends, other members of the Trojan family and the world to see.
Upon returning home for Thanksgiving, many students are greeted by overzealous relatives who are a bit too keen to plant a sloppy kiss on your cheek. During these awkward encounters, a discrete opportunity to spread positive word-of-mouth about USC arises with the simple question: “How do you like college?”
Most Trojans will fervently argue that USC is superior to all other schools in the nation — nay, the world — by citing our victorious football team, our stellar academics, our accessibility to the diverse and exciting experiences Los Angeles has to offer and preternaturally good weather.
Aggressive cheek-kissing relatives will gladly accept many a canned response.
But these shouts of praise often change when we walk away from the table after Thanksgiving dinner and open our laptops. The rise of social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, has made it easier for disgruntled students to complain about life on campus.
Firing off a status update takes less than 30 seconds, and it seems many of these students who say they love USC will also publish messages that reflect negatively upon the university and tarnish its reputation.
The difference is because of the decreased verbal and face-to-face communication that Tweeting, status updates and message boards provide. One would be hard-pressed to find another student with enough cajones to stand up in the middle of a lecture in Taper Hall and scream, “I hate my organic chemistry professor. FML!” But, many have no reservations about publishing this message online for their 1,000 dedicated followers to read.
A false sense of safety and anonymity results in similar situations — with more painful outcomes — on gossip sites such as Collegeacb.com. Collegeacb is JuicyCampus’ annoying little sister that became popular after the gossip monster-mill shut down in February. The website is using its increased traffic to carry on the legacy of tasteless threads dedicated to slandering students, with comments published by the victims’ friends and classmates. Rude posts allow for anyone with an Internet connection to read gossip that misrepresents our school.
It is reasonable for college students to feel insecure, as they are living away from home for the first time and are thrown into a foreign environment. It becomes unreasonable when we teens and 20-somethings, legal adults, fight that insecurity by waxing poetic about other people’s private sexual activities on trashy gossip sites.
Statistics show that unattractive posts on social networking sites can not only affect a college’s reputation, but also its matriculants. A student poll published by College Board and Art and Science Group shows that 18 percent of students  use Facebook or similar sites to aid in their  college search.
Negative comments ultimately end up reflecting more negatively upon the person who wrote it, and the groups they associate with — like USC — instead of the person for whom the vile words were initially intended.
One way to create positive change in the social networking culture that is stuck fostering hateful relationships on college campuses would be to utilize the Internet to organize people committed to improving our campus.
Facebook groups such as URSC’s “Operation: Spice up EVK” have the right idea, and are using the Internet as a forum for productive discussions that are helping increase the quality of USC’s on-campus dining.
If more student groups use Facebook and message boards to achieve goals that will vitalize USC in its continued growth, our campus will adopt a culture that is more motivating and conducive to our success and satisfaction.
Students must commit themselves to the same level of excellence that USC strives for, and part of that means that we must monitor what we publish to make sure that we are encouraging each other and respecting our university.
Kelsey Clark is a sophomore majoring in chemistry.

When the saucer-shaped spaceship called Jupiter 2 launched into the vast void on the ’60s television show Lost in Space, the fate of its previous ship Jupiter 1 remained a mystery.
But four individuals decided to bring this anonymity to life — by naming their band Jupiter One after the ship.

“But after doing more research we found out that it was a failed mission,” frontman K Ishibashi said. “How ironic.”
The irony is unmistakable, for the band’s journey has been anything but a failure.
The New York indie-rock band started off with humble beginnings as a two-person gig with singer and multi-instrumentalist Ishibashi and guitarist Zac Colwell.
Now, nine years later with its sophomore album Sunshower freshly released on Ryko records, the complete four-member group is on tour as the opening band with the talented and quirky female artist Regina Spektor.
Tonight, Jupiter One will perform in front of nearly 6,000 audience members at the Greek Theatre.
This sudden mainstream exposure might faze others, but Ishibashi has a quirk that gives him an edge: He has been playing the violin in Spektor’s band for her European tour since May of this year.
In fact, it was through this very relationship that Ishibashi scored the highly coveted position for his band.
“We became friends, so I just gave her our new album that was coming out,” Ishibashi said. “She really liked it and now we’re opening for her.”
According to Ishibashi, his unconventional turn of events spurred by coincidence was precisely what the band needed.
“Touring as an opener for Regina Spektor is a huge deal for us,” said Ishibashi, who still plays in Spektor’s band following Jupiter One’s opening act. “[When I found out], I wasn’t sure if it was real or not. It was just perfect because our album was about to come out. It was a really great opportunity for exposure.”
Without a doubt, the band has come a long way. Ishibashi and Colwell first met as touring musicians in a traveling circus, with Ishibashi playing the violin and Colwell, the saxophone.
The two started playing music together in the early 2000s, traveling around New York City to play at small local venues. It was during this journey that the duo met previous STOMP member and drummer Dave Heilman, who took the group’s music to a whole new level.
“Simply put, the drummer joined and turned it into a rock band,” Ishibashi said.
The rest of the pieces naturally fell together after that. The newest addition is bassist Pat Dougherty, who hopped on the bandwagon a few years ago. Ishibashi’s wife, Mocha, a fellow violinist, joined the band as a somewhat honorary member after the two met at the Berklee College of Music in Boston.
Although Mocha is not traveling with the band, Ishibashi said she has contributed regularly as keyboardist and back-up singer in the last two albums.
The new album is heavily influenced by the band’s love of both old and modern music. Through the album, Ishibashi said the band defies tradition and strives to embrace the diverse nature of its sound.
“We really want to remind people of the great music of the ’60s and ’70s, [the time of] rock and roll,” he said. “We will constantly try to make this old sound and render it in a modern way. Since when do albums have to be in one place?”
Prior to this tour, the band has traveled across the country, playing in small rock clubs and living off foot-long Subway sandwiches, according to Ishibashi. Its cross-country trek definitely seemed to spread word about its music, as many of its tracks have been featured in video games, commercials and TV shows such as Heroes and Kyle XY.
“It’s kind of been a slow burn for us,” Ishibashi said. “There have been a lot of exposures here and there that were pretty exciting.”
But with this new opportunity of being on tour with Spektor, that slow burn might just have been lit back into a fresh roaring fire.
After regularly playing in front of 200 to 300 people in previous gigs, the band now plays for audiences that are exponentially larger. Two weeks ago, the band opened for the sold-out show at Radio City Music Hall in New York City’s Rockefeller Center before 7,000 fans.
“We definitely do get stage fright,” Ishibashi said. “But we’re really excited because we’ve come this far, and we just want to show people what we can do.”
this article is pretty wonderful. i like reading about bands that i’m not really familiar with so i can check into their music, and this newspaper has been pretty handy with that :) also, it’s dandy to see when a group of people fulfill their dreams about something that they get inspired by :)

A Pac-10 official who worked the USC-Oregon State game Saturday was suspended by the conference for missing an obvious facemask penalty, commissioner Larry Scott announced Monday.
The official, whose name was not released by the Pac-10, was suspended one game for failing to throw a flag after USC safety Taylor Mays seemed to rip the helmet off the Beavers’ James Rodgers on a 7-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter.
“Our members expect a high level of officiating in all our sports and the Conference office shares that expectation,” Scott said in a statement. “We have taken this action in light of the blatant and dangerous nature of the missed call. We have full confidence in our highly trained and qualified staff of football officials, but they, like the coaches and players, are accountable and must meet the high expectations placed upon them.”

Remember a few weeks back when we learned that the economic crisis had forced Harvard to cut back on free food? Well, now you can’t drink on the Harvard campus either; at least, not as long as their coffee machines are being poisoned .
It was actually in August of this year that six researchers at Harvard, at least one of them a student, were sent to the hospital after  drinking coffee with sodium azide. The University only just released information on the incident to the public.
It looks like the incident was deliberate, too. Quoth a toxicologist: “An accident? Sodium azide is a poison.”
Just when you thought swine flu was the biggest threat to college students!
