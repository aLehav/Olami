The Women of Troy entered the Pac-12 Tournament with a six-game win streak, a first round bye, and high hopes that just two more wins could propel them into the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2006.
Instead, USC’s dreams of entering the Big Dance ended once again Thursday, as the No. 11 seed Washington State Cougars (13-19) pulled off a convincing upset over the No. 2 seed USC (18-12) 69-55 in the quarterfinals of the conference tournament.
Offensive woes debilitated USC’s chances at capitalizing on six days of rest, as the Women of Troy shot 24.2 percent before the Galen Center crowd and gave up 22 points off their 17 turnovers in possibly their last game of the season.
USC managed to out-rebound Washington State 45 to 33 and consequently had nine more shots, but the Cougars drained 44.6 percent of their shots and converted on 10 of 20 of their 3-pointers to dispel any run USC had to offer.
USC senior guard Briana Gilbreath notched her 14th career double-double with 17 points and 10 rebounds, but struggles at the free throw line hurt her and team’s chances at a comeback.
Sophomore forward Cassie Harberts, who averages 12.1 points a game for the Women of Troy, shot 1-for-12 to finish with seven points and 12 rebounds.
USC managed to cut the deficit to five with 14:34 remaining, but that would be the closest that USC could get, as the Cougars then pumped out a 9-0 run to balloon the lead to 14.
The Women of Troy last saw a single-digit deficit after Gilbreath scored seven consecutive points for USC to come within eight points with 9:17 remaining.
The Cougars responded with a 9-2 run to hold a 15-point advantage and maintained a double-digit lead for the rest of the game, despite 10 second-half points from USC junior forward Christina Marinacci, who finished with 13.
“We brought the energy in the second half,” Gilbreath said. “We might not have scored the way we wanted to score, but we matched their energy a lot better in the second half than the first.”
Although the Cougars do not have a single player averaging double digits, they thrived off the offensive trio of guards April Cook, Jazmine Perkins and Rosie Tarnowski, who combined for 38 points on 11-for-20 shooting.
It was only the Cougars’ second win in the conference tournament in the program’s history, with the first being their win against No. 6 Oregon State in the first round of the tournament.
USC had swept the season series against Washington State, most recently defeating the Cougars in Pullman 65-54 on Saturday to cap the regular season.
In that game, USC senior guard Ashley Corral led the team with her third career double-double with 25 points and 10 rebounds.
This time around, the leading 3-point shooter in USC history could only muster five points off one trey, along with four rebounds and three assists in the loss.
The Women of Troy will fail to reach the NCAA Tournament for the fifth straight year and instead look for a potential at-large berth to the Women’s National Invitation Tournament.
“We’re going to leave it up to the committee and hope that we’ve done some things good enough to let ourselves in, but it’s a long shot,” USC coach Michael Cooper said.
The WNIT committee will announce the 64-team field on Monday, with the tournament beginning Friday, March 16. Last season, USC won five consecutive games to reach the WNIT title game before losing 68-76 to Toledo.
“This is just a hard moment to talk about because our dreams and visions were much further than this, but it ends today,” Cooper said. “But I am very proud of these young ladies and the effort that they gave us today.”

The outdoor season is just beginning, but the USC track and field team has business to take care of in the indoor season.
The team secured a number of wins at their outdoor meet and finished first in the women’s 4x400m relay at last Friday’s NCAA Last Chance meet in Seattle, Washington. The relay team — freshmen Akawkaw Ndipagbor and Vanessa Jones, sophomore Jenna Puterbaugh and senior co-captain Dalilah Muhammad — achieved the best 4×4 relay time at the meet with a time of 3:37.57, but it was not enough.
The team failed to make qualifying marks for the NCAA Division I Indoor Championships that will take place Friday and Saturday in Nampa, Idaho.
“We just missed qualifying in the 4×4,” coach Ron Allice said. “We could have maybe waited for some scratches, but we felt that we couldn’t run faster, and we needed to be more concerned with being prepared for outdoor [competitions].”
Despite this loss, the Trojans will still compete at Jackson Indoor Track Friday and Saturday. Junior Alitta Boyd will be the sole representative for the Trojans at the Indoor Championships, competing in the long jump.
As the team wraps up their commitments in the indoor track and field season, the outdoor season will consume the rest of the track and field efforts. Though the Trojans will have two meets — a meet this weekend at Cal State Fullerton and a meet next weekend at Cal State Northridge — before competing at home, the team will be mentally and physically preparing for USC’s own Trojan Invitational.
The meet will be the first event featuring serious Division I competition, and will be the first in a string of Division I meets, including the Texas Relays and the Stanford Invite.
“[We will] need a few acid tests before we get to the dual meet conference,” Allice said.
Though upcoming meets will be a factor in the team’s performance in the outdoor season, they can be of even greater significance for the 2012 Olympics. At a time when international recognition of track and field is at its peak, the Trojans will train and prepare their athletes for not only the NCAA Championships, but the Olympics as well.

The USC men’s volleyball team faces both a cross-country foe and a familiar conference opponent this weekend on back-to-back nights.
USC (11-4, 9-4 in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play) will host No. 6 Penn State (13-1, 6-0) Friday, and travel to Malibu Saturday to take on No. 10 Pepperdine (8-8, 6-7).
Though the team is playing their best volleyball of the year, the Nittany Lions provide a challenge.
“Their opposite hitters are young like us,” said coach Bill Ferguson. “They have fantastic setters like us. Their big stick is going up against our big stick.”
That big stick for Penn State would be first-team All-American opposite hitter Joe “Thunder” Sunder. And on the Trojans side is senior opposite hitter Tony Ciarelli, a second-team All-American from last year and MPSF and AVCA National Player of the Week after the Trojans’ successful Bay Area trip two weeks ago.
The match will also be a rare meeting for the Trojans against an east coast team.
“We don’t often get the opportunity to play out of conference,” said freshman middle blocker Robert Feathers. “It’s an exciting challenge.”
One reason for the Trojans’ drastic improvement following a sweep at the hands of UCLA has been a strong commitment to defense. The team leads the nation in blocks, and is No.2 in opposing hitting percentage, holding opponents to a .202 success rate.
“[Assistant coach] Jeff Nygaard’s game plans and blocking schemes have really become effective in his second season,” Ferguson said. “The upperclassmen are used to his system and terminology, while the freshmen and sophomores don’t know any other system”.
Feathers has noticed the intensity as well. “Credit needs to be given to our passers,” he said. “Steve [Shandrick] has stepped up his game lately, and Henry [Cassiday] has become a great leader on the back row.”
A position of flux this year for the Trojans has been the outside hitter position opposite to Ciarelli. Currently, junior Maddison McKibbin is starting after his return from an ankle injury, but the position has also been manned by fellow juniors Steven Mochalski and Jeff Carlson.
“We’re going with whoever is hot when the time comes” Ferguson said. “Maddison has been our best blocker, so we might also switch him to opposite hitter to play alongside Tanner [Jansen].”
After this weekend, a matchup on March 14 brings an opportunity for revenge against top-ranked UCLA. Yet, the Trojans are focused solely on this weekend’s slate.
“It would be a tremendous disservice to Penn State and Pepperdine if we overlook them heading into the weekend,” Ferguson said.

The announcement took all of 30 seconds to say, but the ramifications are still being felt.
Ever since senior quarterback Matt Barkley declared his intention to return to school for his senior season on national television, USC has been lauded as the preseason favorite to win the national championship.
When the “experts” talk of such predictions, the discussion usually centers on Barkley and Co. on the offensive end.  One of Barkley’s main targets, sophomore receiver Marqise Lee, made some sensational plays in practice on Thursday.
“[Lee] was the MVP of today,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said.  “Obviously he’s a great player and he has the potential to be a real star player.”
The Trojans do not just feature an experienced offense, however. With eight starters returning from last year’s squad that was third in the conference in points allowed, the Trojan defense is not to be taken lightly.
“As a defense, we just come out and do what we’re supposed to do,” junior cornerback Nickell Robey said.  “All we’re worried about is winning on third downs and getting off the field.”
Robey, a starter since his freshman season, has taken on more of a leadership role this year and has made it a point of emphasis to help the younger players adjust.
“We have a lot of young guys, so we’re trying to get them acclimated to the system.  When we can do that, we’re going to be better as a defense.”
On Thursday, the defense got the better of the high profile offense, forcing turnovers and making it difficult for the offense to move the ball.
“The defense kind of dominated today for the most part,” Kiffin said.  “It’s always hard to evaluate the offensive line and the run game when you have no pads on.”
With the loss of three starters on the defensive line from last year’s unit, defensive line coach Ed Orgeron is relying on newcomers to step up.
“We have to show up inside.  That’s where it all starts,” Orgeron said.  “If you’re weak inside, you’re not going to have the type of team you want.”
Orgeron is hoping for solid play from returning seniors Devon Kennard and Wes Horton.
“Devon and Wes are coming.  Those are guys I expect to play well,” said Orgeron. “Last year, Devon had some missed sacks, some missed plays.  But he’ll get them this year.”
If Thursday’s practice was any indication, the defense will turn some heads this season.

She’s got one of the most conflicting images in Hollywood. With her original innocence as Cindy Lou Who in How the Grinch Stole Christmas and her good-girl-gone-bad act on Gossip Girl, Taylor Momsen tends to leave audiences confused —her personas are different even as she dazzles with every performance. And when Momsen’s band, The Pretty Reckless, released their second EP, Hit Me Like A Man, this past Tuesday, Momsen proved she’s got the talent to trade acting for a successful music career.
“I didn’t choose acting or modeling, I got thrown into it,” said Momsen in a bio on the band’s website.  “I liked it, so that wasn’t a problem, but music and songwriting are what I’ve always really wanted to do. I’ve been working with producers and hanging out in recording studios since I was five, I just couldn’t put out an album when I was eight…Now I can.”
Momsen’s newly channeled energies are apparent on Hit Me Like A Man, which is available for download on iTunes. Though the EP features two live performances of former hits (“Makes Me Wanna Die” and “Since You’re Gone”), the remaining three tracks are innovative even as they remain true to the band’s former alternative-meets-classic-rock sound.
The title track, “Hit Me Like A Man,” is perhaps the most memorable. The song opens with a series of grungy guitar riffs before Momsen’s mature, muffled vocals enter for the first verse.
“I am strong, love is evil,” croons Momsen. “It’s a version of perversion that is only for the lucky people.” The song’s dark lyrics only serve to augment the heavy quality of the music.
“Cold Blooded” follows the same thematic elements of “Hit Me Like A Man.” Though the song begins slowly with a dragging, synth-like guitar and doesn’t melodically resemble any other track, Momsen continues to warn audiences of the sinister side of love, which serves as a nice way to connect an album that concerns itself with finding a new sound on each track.
To be fair, Momsen’s rock group The Pretty Reckless is hardly new. The band debuted in 2010 with their album Light Me Up, which featured memorable songs like “You,” and “My Medicine.” But with a large international following, The Pretty Reckless’ tours have been primarily focused overseas, featuring stops in Australia, the UK and France. Nevertheless, with The Medicine Tour, which lasts from March until the end of April, the band seems to be trying to build up a larger American fan base.
The Pretty Reckless will be performing at the Constellation Room in Santa Ana this Sunday March 11 and at the House of Blues Sunset Strip on March 14.
