All season, throughout the ups and downs, USC baseball coach Frank Cruz has said that his players are fighters. And after looking lifeless in a three game sweep at the hands of No. 21 Arizona State over the weekend, Cruz stood by his claim.
“We’ll be fine,” said Cruz following the Sunday finale. “We’ll bounce back. Practice at 5:30 a.m. [Monday]; we’ll be ready to go.”
The Trojans (19-14, 5-9) were outscored 17-2 over three games against the Sun Devils (23-12, 9-6) in Tempe, falling to outstanding pitching and stagnant bats.
“We just couldn’t hit,” Cruz said. “Hitting is contagious. So is not hitting. It just takes over a lineup.”
Sunday, for the first time all series, the Trojans showed life early in the game. They took their first lead of the series on a hit-by-pitch, an error and a pair of groundouts. But that didn’t last for a single hitter in the bottom of the inning, as senior starter Ben Mount gave up a home run to lead off the inning, another two batters later, and then two more before he was pulled from the game. The Sun Devils tacked on two more in the third and it was all over against the lifeless Trojan bats. Two more in the eight gave Arizona State an 8-1 win to complete the sweep.
Sun Devil starting pitcher Darren Gilles went five innings, allowing just one unearned run and three hits. And that was the Sun Devil starter’s least impressive outing of the series.
The best belonged to Trevor Williams, who was sensational on Saturday. The sophomore outdueled Trojan freshman Stephen Tarpley and then some. Williams pitched a complete game shutout, giving up four hits, with no walks to his six strikeouts. The Trojans put a runner in scoring position just three times against Williams, who was aided by rally-stopping double plays in both the seventh and ninth innings.
Tarpley pitched well for the Trojans, but could not match Williams. He gave up a run in the first inning on a triple and a sacrifice-fly, then got out of a bases loaded jam in the second. From the third through sixth, Tarpley faced no more than four hitters in an inning.
But in the seventh, a single, RBI-double and an RBI-single gave the Sun Devils two more runs for a 3-0 lead, insurmountable against a pitcher as dominant as Williams. Arizona State tacked on one more in the eighth for good measure to make the final 4-0.
On Friday, it was Sun Devil ace Brady Rodgers who dominated. An almost surefire day-one draft pick, Rodgers was in control the entire game. The junior allowed one run on six hits over eight commanding innings.  Most impressive was his control: Rodgers fanned seven Trojans without walking any.
Trojans ace Andrew Triggs was, like Tarpley the following day, impressive. But much like Tarpley again, the senior could not keep up with his Sun Devil counterpart. Triggs allowed two runs in the first inning behind a pair of singles and a two-RBI double, and then settled down nicely, shutting out the Sun Devils over the next five innings.
The Trojans got one run back in the fifth behind a double by senior designated hitter Brandon Garcia and an RBI-single by sophomore second baseman James Roberts. The Trojans threatened for more by putting runners on second and third, but both were stranded.
Like the night before, the Sun Devils broke the game open in the seventh. Triggs hit the leadoff batter, and after getting an out gave up a two-run homer to make it a 4-1 game. A triple and an RBI-single made it 5-1 Sun Devils before Triggs was removed.
After such a disappointing weekend, the Trojans will not have to wait long to get back on the field. They travel to Cal State Bakersfield on Tuesday and host UC Santa Barbara Wednesday evening at Dedeaux Field.
Not a fun weekend to be a USC pitcher! With a total of 2 runs scored all weekend, Triggs (3.70 era on Fri) would’ve had to have been perfect to get the win while Tarpley (2.96 era on the Sat) still would not have gotten the win even had he thrown 9 perfect innings! I felt most badly for Mount (5.44 era on the day) on Sunday, we really need him to climb out of his funk.  
An aside:  For those of us who can’t travel, I wish our web site informed us of alternate coverage on away games… almost missed the fact that these games were (and are still) available on Fox Sports Arizona.com!  Same “stadium cam” coverage but they used professional FOX announcers (who by the way, seemed to be quite enamored with Tarpley’s poise and control but not always with his pitch selection). Good Luck Tonight Boys… Fight On!

USC women’s tennis survived their most difficult weekend of matches this season as they split their road trip up north losing to Stanford on Friday before rallying for a victory against Cal on Saturday.
Ranked No. 4 in the country, USC (19-3, 8-1) squared off against fellow top-10 teams with the undefeated Stanford Cardinal and their unblemished 16-win season ranked sixth and the Golden Bears and their No. 10 ranking.
Pitting two teams with perfect records in conference play, something had to give in the Women of Troy’s matchup against the Cardinal. Behind their strong play at the top of singles, Stanford was able to pull out a 4-2 winner capped off by No. 3 Nicole Gibbs’ two-set victory over freshman Zoe Scandalis.
Slotted in the first singles’ position from the start of the season, Scandalis, who sits at No. 20 in the country, has consistently played against other teams’ top talent and overall she has faired relatively well under the pressure, especially when you consider her young age. This weekend hit her particularly hard as the freshman went up against the nation’s top singles players in Gibbs and Cal’s 8th-ranked Jana Juricova.
In the first set against Gibbs, Scandalis fought the Stanford sophomore into a tiebreaker before bowing out 7-6 (4) and then went on to lose the second set in another gritty performance 6-2. Despite the losses, both Scandalis and coach Richard Gallien have to be pleased with how she’s held up so far this season.
With doubles’ play suspended because of weather conditions, the Women of Troy had to fight that much harder during singles and Stanford’s depth was the driving force behind their success. On court four, No. 57 Ellen Tay easily took down sophomore Kaitlyn Christian to start off singles’ play.
Christian’s loss, plus 23rd-ranked junior Danielle Lao losing a rare match on court two to Stanford’s 7th-ranked Mallory Burdette, made it difficult for the Women of Troy to ever gain momentum during the match. Despite a valiant effort from freshman No. 33 Sabrina Santamaria and senior Alison Ramos, who eac posted wins, USC could not overcome their losses at the top.
On Saturday, the Women of Troy won in their trademark fashion with a 5-3 comeback victory against Cal. Despite losing the doubles’ point after a surprising defeat on court one for the No. 7 Christian and Santamaria pairing, USC stayed strong even after singles began with Scandalis’ loss to Juricova 6-1, 6-0.
On cue, though, the Women of Troy came roaring back recording wins in their usual spots in the heart of their lineup. Junior Danielle Lao got back to her winning ways with an upset victory against No. 12 Zsofi Susanyi, 6-2, 7-5, on court two, and Santmaria made it two wins for the weekend after a win over Anett Schutting in third singles.
Capping off four wins in a row, Kaitlyn Christian recovered form her previos day’s drubbing to beat the higher-ranked No. 55 Tayler Davis 7-6 (3), 6-3 on court four and the clincher came from junior Valeria Pulido with a three-set win in a surprise start at six.
With Stanford losing to UCLA on Saturday, next week’s matchup against the rival Bruins is an important game for the breakdown fo the Pac-12 standings. The Women of Troy will have more than just pride to fight for when they head to Westwood in a battle looking to redeem their early season losses.

USC announced an exclusive multiyear national broadcasting deal with ESPN Radio on Monday. The radio network will broadcast every home football game with a reach of up to 300 national affiliates.
“This agreement with ESPN Radio will provide tremendous, unprecedented exposure for USC football and it will help elevate the USC brand,” said Dan Shell, the vice president and general manager of USC Sports Properties. “It will also benefit our sponsors by providing them a nationally distributed platform to connect with their target audience.”
The agreement marks the first time ESPN Radio has cut an exclusive national deal with a college football program and it’s the second radio deal of this magnitude.
ESPN’s Los Angeles radio station, 710 KSPN, began broadcasting USC games in 2006. The new deal also grants ESPN Deportes Radio exclusive Spanish-language broadcast rights.
“USC and the Trojan football program are extremely excited to have all of our home games carried nationally by ESPN Radio,” USC athletic director Pat Haden said. “To partner with ESPN Radio and have the USC brand distributed at this level is a fantastic opportunity to reach Trojan fans throughout the nation. It is also immensely important that we will be able to reach our Hispanic fan base throughout Southern California with ESPN Deportes.”

Eager to get back on the field after being swept at the hands of No. 21 Arizona State over the weekend, the USC baseball team does not have to wait long for a chance at some redemption.
USC travels to Bakersfield tonight to take on the Roadrunners at 6 p.m.
Struggles · Sophomore infielder Kevin Swick and the Trojans have stumbled since sweeping Cal State Bakersfield back in early March. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (19-14) swept the Roadrunners over a three-game series in the beginning of March, including two thrilling come-from-behind ninth-inning rallies in the first two games and a dominating 6-0 shutout in the series finale.
But the Trojans have fallen into a slump. They have been 7-11 since their sweep in Bakersfield and have lost six of their last nine, five of their last seven and four in a row, capped off with the sweep by the Sun Devils — in which the Trojans were outscored 17-2.
“We’ll bounce back,” USC coach Frank Cruz said. “This team always does. And we have no choice.”
Throughout the season, Cruz has asserted that his team competes in a way few of his have before. That competitiveness and perseverance will be necessary to bounce back, especially against a team as hot as Bakersfield.
Unlike the Trojans, the Roadrunners have caught fire since the end of March. They’ve won 10 of their last 13 games and eight of their last 10.
“We have to hit better,” Cruz said. “Our pitching is doing everything we can ask of them. We’ve just got to put runs on the board.”
After taking on the Roadrunners tonight, the Trojans host UC Santa Barbara on Wednesday. With a rare set of back-to-back midweek games, the USC pitching staff would normally be stretched thin. But with no series this upcoming weekend, Cruz and pitching coach Dan Hubbs don’t have to worry about saving any arms for a full week.
Must win both midweek games to even have a chance to be selected for post season play.

The USC football team released its final spring depth chart Monday morning following the completion of spring practices.
Coach Lane Kiffin did not decide on a second-string quarterback as he stated after the spring game, listing redshirt freshmen Cody Kessler and Max Wittek as co-second-string signal callers behind senior Matt Barkley.
No clarity · The depth chart did not clear up the backup quarterback spot as freshmen Max Wittek (above) and Cody Kessler are co-second stringers. - Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
Sophomore tackle Aundrey Walker broke into the starting lineup claiming the left tackle job. The fight between Walker and redshirt junior Kevin Graf for the left tackle job was one of the primary storylines throughout spring practice. Graf will continue to start at right tackle.
Freshman fullback Soma Vainuku and Walker are the only new offensive starters from the 2011 squad. Walker will replace 2011 All-American tackle Matt Kalil, who entered the 2012 NFL draft.
Defensively, sophomore J.R. Tavai was named starting nose tackle and redshirt sophomore George Uko was named starting defensive tackle, replacing departed tackles DaJohn Harris and Christian Tupou.
Senior Devon Kennard and redshirt senior Wes Horton will team up as the team’s defensive ends. Then-junior Nick Perry, a first team all-conference selection at defensive end last season, also declared for the 2012 NFL draft.
Junior Nickell Robey is still locked in at one cornerback position, but the other side features a three-way tie between senior Isiah Wiley, senior Brian Baucham and redshirt junior Torin Harris.
Senior safety Jawanza Starling — who started alongside senior T.J. McDonald in 2011 — is listed as a co-starter with junior Demetrius Wright.
Recently cleared transfer defensive back Josh Shaw is listed as the third-string free safety behind McDonald and senior Drew McAllister.
No incoming freshmen are placed in the depth chart with spring-roster players, but Nelson Agholor is listed under wide receiver and tailback.

Spring football is officially over at USC. The annual spring game held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum gave the team and fans the final taste of Trojan football until fall.
Matt Barkley has constantly been in the spotlight since his decision to forgo the 2011 NFL draft. Like his team, Barkley has received significant hype — even greater than that of previous seasons- — surrounding the possibility of him earning the most esteemed award in college football — the Heisman Trophy.
Though Barkley fell short of the Heisman voting last season (he finished sixth), college football addicts can only fathom what possibilities exist. With so much hype surrounding Barkley’s potential performance, Trojan fans are fixed on how well he performed during the annual spring game.
On Saturday, Barkley was 23 of 39 for 212 yards with one touchdown and one interception during the 91-play game. Barkley split the bulk of playing time with redshirt freshman backup quarterbacks Cody Kessler and Max Wittek. Barkley’s performance, however, left some questioning whether he will live up to the immense praise he has received and if he will become the school’s third Heisman-winning quarterback.
Despite the lackluster performance in the spring game, Barkley is still worthy of Heisman buzz.
Since Barkley’s earliest days at USC, he has improved immensely. After enrolling in spring 2009, Barkley easily earned the starting quarterback position after an impressive performance during spring practices. It was no surprise that then-coach Pete Carroll decided to start Barkley as a true freshman.
In his first season at USC, Barkley threw 211-352 (59.9 percent) for 2,735 yards, 15 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. Barkley’s performance earned him numerous accolades, such as being a semifinalist for the 2009 Davey O’Brien Award and the 2009 CollegeFootballNews.com freshman all-American honorable mention — in addition to winning the Emerald Bowl against Boston College.
Following Carroll’s departure, Barkley has clearly thrived under the tutelage of USC coach Lane Kiffin. During 2010, Barkley’s sophomore season, he threw 236-377 (62.6 percent) for 2,791 yards, 26 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. Barkley was launched into the national spotlight and earned all-conference honors.
Barkley’s third season for the Trojans demonstrated why he ranks as one of the best in the country. The 2011 season was the most fruitful. Not only did the Trojans upset ranked and conference rival Oregon in Eugene, USC almost defeated ranked Stanford in triple overtime, ending the last season with an overall record of 10-2.
Barkley was 307-446 (69.1 percent) for 3,528 yards throwing 39 touchdowns and seven interceptions. Aside from finishing sixth in Heisman voting, he was a finalist for the Manning Award, Walter Camp Award, Maxwell Award and Davey O’Brien Award. He won the 2011 College Football Performance Awards National Performer of the Year, Pac-12 Player of the Week, along with numerous others.
Barkley’s improvement during his career at USC points to the fact that he is worthy of consideration in pre-season Heisman discussion. Trojan fans should not fret after seeing Barkley’s performance Saturday because USC does not kick off the 2012 season until Sept. 1.
Keep in mind, most of the spring football practice reps at quarterback have been divvied up between Wittek and Kessler, who are battling for the back-up position. Though Barkley had offensive weapon sophomore receiver Marqise Lee, he is still missing one of his other favorite targets — sophomore receiver Robert Woods.
And don’t forget that the Heisman is awarded to the player that has not only succeeded individually, but has also led his team significantly.
With that in mind, Barkley should have just as good a chance as anyone for the Heisman. Now all he has to do is deliver.

After a disappointing 2011-2012 season, two Women of Troy are moving onto bigger things. For the first time since the inaugural WNBA draft in 1997, two members of the USC women’s basketball team were selected in the WNBA draft Monday, becoming the ninth and 10th USC players taken in the draft. Guards Jacki Gemelos and Briana Gilbreath were both chosen in the third round of the draft with picks number 31 and 35, respectively.
Drafted · Former USC guard Briana Gilbreath (above) was drafted by the Washington Mystics in Monday’s WNBA draft. Gilbreath was an all-conference performer in all four of her seasons on campus. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The day marked the culmination of trials and tribulations for Gemelos, who battled injuries throughout her USC career. A former top-ranked recruit coming out of St. Mary’s High School in Stockton, Calif., she suffered four separate knee injuries that caused her to miss nearly four complete seasons. In her only fully healthy season, Gemelos averaged 12.4 points per game in 2010-2011, while leading the Pac-10 in 3-point shooting at 42.4 percent. Her performance that year earned her an All-Pac-10 honorable mention nod and a spot on Team USA for the 2011 World University Games, as well as a finalist spot for the V Foundation Comeback Award.
Gemelos played in 57 games for USC, averaging 11.2 points, 4.9 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game. She ended her college career as the school’s leading free-throw shooter with at 83.3 percent. In being chosen by the Minnesota Lynx, she joins a very talented squad — one that won the WNBA championship last season.
Briana Gilbreath has been a star for USC ever since she set foot in the Galen Center. A four-time all-conference performer, she regularly filled up the stat sheet, ending her Trojan career ranked in the top 10 in five statistical categories:  No. 4 in blocks (168), No. 6 in steals (241), No. 6 in made free throws (388), No. 8 in rebounds (813) and No. 9 in points (1,608). She also is tied for the all-time lead in games played in school history, along with fellow teammate guard Ashley Corral and Cheryl Miller.
Gilbreath was selected to the Pac-12 All-Defensive Team as well as the AP All-America team this past season. She also finished her career ranked No. 8 all-time in the Pac-12 for blocks and No. 31 and No. 36 for scoring and rebounds, respectively.
Gilbreath was picked by the Washington Mystics, a team that struggled last season to a 6-28 record, good for last place in the Eastern Conference.
A native of Houston, Texas, Gilbreath projects to be a defensive stopper at the professional level, capable of guarding multiple positions with her athleticism and instincts.

Detectives provided the families with up-to-date information in the ongoing investigation surrounding the deaths of Wu and Qu, who were shot and killed early Wednesday morning while sitting in Qu’s vehicle on Raymond Avenue, northwest of campus.
The Los Angeles Times also reported that detectives visited the crime scene with both families.
Authorities have not made an arrest in the case. USC is offering a $125,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspect or suspects.
Officer Karen Reyner said that detectives have received numerous calls since the award was announced at a press conference Friday, but no new information on the case is available to the public.
“The investigation is ongoing,” Reyner said. “[Detectives] are not leaving any stone unturned.”
Anyone with information is asked to call the LAPD’s Criminal Gang Homicide Division at (213) 485-4341 or the Detective Information Desk at the 24-hour toll-free number 877-LAPD-24-7.

Thornton School of Music Professor Bill Biersach’s class, The Beatles: Their Music and Their Times (MUSC 422) is one of USC’s most popular courses, but more than 20 years ago, it was one of the most controversial.
Music · Bill Biersach, a senior lecturer of composition, has taught The Beatles: Their Music and Their Times (MUSC 422) for more than 20 years. - Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
“When the course was new, various TV stations got a hold of the story and they would call me, one after another, and say, ‘We’re doing a series on interesting college courses,’” Biersach said. “By the time it was on TV, they spun it into, ‘Do you realize how your tuition dollars are being spent?’ and they would denigrate the whole point of the class.”
For Biersach, there was never any question about the value of a course about the Beatles.
“The Beatles contributed so much to the art of recording itself,” Biersach said. “I originally thought of it in the context of recording arts, a course on all the things the Beatles had contributed.”
When Biersach formally proposed the class, he decided the class should cater to more than just students interested in the recording industry and created a course about everything Beatles.
“The Beatles had been my passion since they first came out,” he said. “I had many books on them and had always followed everything they did. It wasn’t that hard to propose a Beatles course that was all-encompassing instead of just focusing on recording.”
Biersach started as a classically trained pianist with dreams of being a rock star. He taught himself to play guitar using a Simon & Garfunkel songbook and joined his first garage band in the seventh grade. Around the same time, he began composing, but when it came time for college, he decided to attend USC as an English major.
“At the time, it was the major that had the most electives,” he said. “I didn’t really know what I wanted to be or what I wanted to do. I just wanted to sample everything.”
Biersach said he took classes in a variety of topics but never let go of his dream to become a rock musician. His sophomore year, he discovered a synthesizer class that sparked his interest in recording.
“The synthesizer had been around for about five years by then, but it was a mystery,” Biersach said. “No one really knew what it was or how to work it. I’m not a person who is intuitively at ease with technical stuff. The synthesizer is the only thing in my life, besides the piano and the guitar, that, when I first saw a picture of it in a magazine, I knew what it did.”
He took the class six times over the course of his education, learning how to use a synthesizer before transitioning into directed and experimental research courses. After graduating, he was offered a position as a part-time teacher of the course.
“The things students are interested in have changed over the years, but I still get students every semester that are completely impassioned about the Beatles,” Biersach said. “I hear from a lot of students that they’re dissatisfied with what’s coming out today, so there seems to be a big turn back to something better and the ’60s seem to be more satisfying.”
Biersach said there has never been a problem filling the Beatles class or another class he teaches about music of the 1960s, and he has not lost any interest in teaching them. In more than 20 years of teaching the Beatles course, he said he has never taught it the same way twice and sometimes learns from the students themselves.
“I recently found out from some of my Russian students how important the Beatles were in Russia back in the ’60s and ’70s,” he said. “Although they were banned, their music was spread everywhere. It gave everybody hope and made everyone feel good. The whole Beatles thing helped in its own way to alter the Soviet empire. They did have an impact; they had an influence.”
Now, Biersach is developing other similar courses for Thornton’s recently added popular music department, including seminars he teaches about classic rock artists, such as The Doors, Simon & Garfunkel and the Rolling Stones.
“It’s funny, when I first proposed the Beatles class back in the mid-’80s, there were some professors who really didn’t like it,” he said. “They saw the School of Music as a conservatory, and the thought of teaching a course on a modern rock group was offensive. It goes to show you how much things have changed.”

Leslie Ivie, ambassador of the Liberty Hill Foundation, an L.A.-based nonprofit, described on Monday the state of socioeconomic conditions in Los Angeles and suggested solutions for closing the wealth gap in the United States at Closing the Racial Wealth Gap.
“Let’s imagine a grand canyon as the wealth gap, and the water that formed and eroded it as the policies that have been enacted in the last few decades,” Ivie said. “It was not individual laziness that caused [the gap], but the erosion of policies and laws over time.”

Ivie cited a speech by Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), in which Lee blames Wall Street for the widening socioeconomic divide in the United States.
“Wall Street has focused its efforts on stripping minority communities of what little [assets] they have managed to earn,” Lee said. “A fundamental cornerstone of the American dream is becoming tougher and tougher to accomplish.”
A recent Pew Research Center study found that levels of poverty and unemployment for minority communities hover at about twice the national average.
Chrysta Wilson, managing partner of Social Change Consultants, said the socioeconomic divide among minority populations is attributed to how policies are written and implemented.
“Policies were integral in the building of this wealth gap,” Wilson said. “While policies aren’t on face racist, the way they’re written and enforced has systematically eliminated people of color from building assets.”
Ivie, who served as a public defender prior to joining the Liberty Hill Foundation, said socioeconomic disparities among minorities also have unpredictable legal ramifications.
“If you’re a low-income woman charged with prostitution as a misdemeanor, which is often because of economic or mental health reasons that you enter the profession, you have no money and have to wait all day for this [meeting],” Ivie said. “You have to pay babysitters, get off work, sometimes lose jobs as a result. That’s a systemic level impact on communities of color.”
Jody Vallejo, an assistant professor of sociology, said the discriminatory housing market creates barriers to structural change for impoverished minorities.
“If you don’t have access to assets, you cannot prevent downward mobility,” Vallejo said. “Home ownership is the way by which most measure wealth.”
Marisol Maciel-Cervantes, a graduate student studying planning, said the recession has augmented the socioeconomic divide among the American population.
“A gap does currently exist, and given the current recession, the gap is increasing,” Maciel-Cervantes said.
The situation, however, is improving for impoverished minorities, Wilson said, but she warned there is still a need for new policies and action.
“The boat has gotten bigger, things look better,” Wilson said. “But, then there’s rain and chaos and tornadoes and the boat still overturns.”
The event, sponsored by the Sol Price School of Public Policy, was held in Ralph and Goldy Lewis Hall.

A sense of urgency typically characterizes the class registration process at USC. In anticipation of her fall 2012 registration appointment, Liz Wolfenden asked a friend with an earlier appointment date to “hold” a certain WRIT 340 class for her.
This emerging practice involves students with earlier registration appointments holding classes only to drop them when their friends are able to register and pick up the newly dropped classes.
“I heard the WRIT-340 classes fill up very fast so I asked my friend with an earlier registration date if she could fit one into her schedule temporarily and then drop it when I became eligible to register,” said Wolfenden, a junior majoring in natural science and mathematics. “I’ve heard a lot of people talking about doing this for each other over the past few weeks.”
USC has implemented a cap on the number of units students can register for to prevent students from holding classes for other students.
KC Peterson, director for information technology and development for the Office of Admissions and planning, said students can register for a maximum of 20 units, and the university will determine whether to reduce the maximum units to 16 at the culmination of the fall 2012 registration process. Previously, students could register for 24 units.
Associate Registrar of Registration and Scheduling Frank Chang said he is concerned with the trend of students holding classes because it creates an uneven playing field.
Registration appointments are based on students’ class standing, which is determined by the number of units they have completed. Chang says that holding classes for friends threatens the driving philosophy of USC’s web registration system: access and equity.
“Our system is a meritocracy in the sense that students who have more credits are entitled to earlier registration times,” Chang said.  “It’s dishonest and no longer fair if you have someone who has more units adding a class they don’t plan on taking just to save that space for you.”
The loophole that students have discovered is possible because of Web Registration’s flexible design, Chang said. Though the majority of students take 16 to 18 units per semester, the system allows them to register for up to 20 units. Chang said the university does not know what students’ true scheduling intentions are until the third week of the semester.
Currently, there is no school policy that prohibits students from holding classes for each other. One possible solution is restricting the number of units that students can add to 16 or 18 unless students obtain clearance, Chang said.
Chang, however, added that lowering the registration threshold would not be worth the added inconvenience to students who legitimately want to take more than 16 units.
“USC has a broad curriculum and students are encouraged to choose classes with breadth and depth,” Chang said. “It would go against the philosophy we have as an institution to restrict students in that aspect. At this point we are not planning on making the system less flexible.”
Chang noted the increasingly popular trend of holding classes can be attributed to a misinformed urgency during registration time. He said departments are mindful of enrollment in their courses and make enough classes available accordingly, and he advises students to contact the professors of closed classes in order to be accommodated.
“If you want to take a certain class, the majority of the time the instructor will approve your request,” Chang said.  “People who resort to using others’ registration times are gaining an unfair advantage.”
Peterson said her department will continue to look into students holding classes and possible solutions to mitigate the practice.
“We can encourage professors to create official waitlists for their courses so if someone drops the class that spot will be given to the next person in line,” Peterson said.  “We will have to look at the symptoms further and make sure there are no bugs in the system.”
Rebecca Southern, a freshman majoring in biological sciences, said she can relate to students that hold classes, but she also said students that hold classes are abusing the system.
“It can be difficult to get the classes that I want, so I understand why students would do this,” Southern said. “When people hold classes for each other, they are getting around the system that has been put in place to maximize fairness. Students should not be manipulating the system, but this goes to show that there are some issues with the registration process.”
As a USC parent it is extremely frustrating to watch my child struggle to get the classes she needs/wants to take.  During the USC orientation, the parents were told that not being able to get classes was a state school problem and that it rarely happens at SC.   Apparently, we were not told the truth.  This is a huge USC problem.  We cannot afford to pay for an addition semester or year of tuition because my daughter could not take the required classes for her major.  Something needs to be done and quickly.
The USC parent is completely correct from her point of view, and has written a very well-crafted paragraph explaining her opinion and calling for action.  Writing classes are one of the most important subjects studied in the liberal arts college.  Logic (dept. of philosophy), is the other most important subject.  It is not logical for a student to ‘hold’ a class they do not intend to attend, which might impede, delay, or prevent another fellow student from registering for the class.

As far as showbiz mentors go, independent-filmmaker-turned-HBO-darling Lena Dunham could do a lot worse than Judd Apatow.
Apatow, the writer-director-producer variously responsible in one capacity or another for The 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad, Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Pineapple Express, is prolific, but with so many box-office smashes under his belt, he’s also one of the surest bets in comedy today.
Four broke girls · Allison Williams (left), Jemima Kirke (center left), Lena Dunham (center right), Zosia Mamet (right) star as a group of struggling girls in their 20s in Dunham’s new HBO comedy. Dunham gained widespread recognition for her award-winning Tiny Furniture and followed suit with Girls, a brutally honest comedy that brings a unique flair to everyday life in New York. - Photo courtesy of Mark Seliger
Dunham, on the other hand, is a relative newcomer to the industry. Believe it or not, it wasn’t her role as “Nurse 1” in the critically lauded HBO miniseries Mildred Pierce that proved to be her breakout opportunity, but rather her much buzzed-about film Tiny Furniture. After premiering at South by Southwest in 2010, where Tiny Furniture won best narrative feature, the movie earned Dunham the best first screenplay award at that year’s Independent Spirit Awards.
Ever since Tiny Furniture, most insiders have known Dunham is one to watch. Her latest feat — starring in a show that she created, now airing on HBO — is nothing short of a Cinderella story for the 25-year-old.
Girls, which premiered Sunday night at 10:30, chronicles the exploits of four 20-somethings — three of them recent college graduates, one still attending — struggling to find place and purpose in New York City. The pilot episode finds Hannah Horvath (Dunham) reeling from her parents’ declaration that she will receive “one final push” before being cut off. Dispensing with euphemisms, Hannah’s mother delicately explains the situation over dinner another way: “No. More. Money.”
If that premise sounds less than compelling, those involved with the show would probably like for you to know that the show’s charm lies not in its less-than-groundbreaking concept, but in its execution of familiar ideas.
After all, if audiences want to laugh at the vengeance with which New York chews up and spits out unfit newcomers, they wouldn’t have to look any further than ABC’s recent debut Don’t Trust the B— in Apartment 23. If they want to see glamorous women who, for the most part, already have it together, there are six seasons worth of Sex and the City DVDs to catch up on.
So what exactly does Girls bring to the table? Nothing that audiences can remember ordering, that’s for sure, but that doesn’t necessarily mean Girls is doomed be sent back to the kitchen.
What Girls offers up is a keen sense of self-awareness that can be most accurately described as painful. The central hardship of Girls — the injustice of Hannah’s parents’ decision to no longer subsidize her lifestyle — is preposterously privileged, but that tiny detail isn’t lost on Dunham. Instead, she seems to relish in the absurdity of her character’s situation, satirizing her and her friends’ perceived problems with an admirable sense of self-mockery.
Far from compromising the characters’ relatability, or making the conflicts that propel Girls feel low-stakes or artificial, Dunham shines a light on these young women’s broadly unsympathetic issues in a way that makes the show all the more authentic. They might be stupid problems but they are Hannah’s problems, nonetheless, and she seems to have zero interest in putting them in perspective. After all, who wants to be told that their problems are small potatoes?
Hannah’s generation turned an image of a crying young woman into the “First-World Problems” meme‘ (example: “Need to refill the Brita, but the dirty dishes are piled too high”). Clearly, there’s an interest in seeing problems with less than life-or-death consequence depicted in various outlets. Dunham’s insight puts her very closely in touch with the fickle interests of her peers; as her character says, “I think I may be the voice of my generation,” or as she qualifies a second later, “at least a voice … of a generation.”
More so than anything else, what’s being showcased in Girls is Dunham’s ability to give voice to the class of society to which she belongs, a class that is anything but disenfranchised, but would never turn down media representation of themselves or their problems.
Like much of the great comedy out there, Girls’ humor is almost exclusively born of truth: The hardest laughs come from the most accurate observations of life. It was the same sort of insight that first put Judd Apatow on the map with Freaks and Geeks, a now-classic NBC casualty of 1999 that was canceled after just one masterful season.
Freaks and Geeks was the rare comedy that was both meaningful and genuinely funny; the show’s achingly on-point depiction of the nuanced high school hierarchy didn’t rely on tired clichés or reductive stereotypes (title notwithstanding). The meticulous insight that appears to have bred Dunham’s Girls is exactly what afforded Freaks and Geeks its — unfortunately posthumous — status as a cult-classic.
Jason Segel (Forgetting Sarah Marshall, The Muppets, How I Met Your Mother) is another former up-and-comer who has benefited enormously from Apatow’s tutelage. The super-producer took Segel under his wing as a mentor, and judging from the upcoming release of The Five-Year Engagement, which Segel both stars in and wrote, it seems as if Segel has been well-schooled in the art of making a blockbuster. Dunham, on the other hand, seems like the kind of talent that a Freaks and Geeks-era Apatow from the early 2000s would have been more inclined to nurture.
Apatow and Dunham’s shared passion for keen observation is patently evident in both their brands of comedy. Girls could represent the start of a beautiful friendship for the show’s upstart star and its veteran executive producer, but more importantly for audiences, the show could usher in a new wave of brash and unapologetically honest comedy.

Football fans have the Superbowl. Music fanatics have the Coachella music festival. And geeks have Comic-Con.
The annual event, held in San Diego, is a crowded, chaotic and exciting four days where geek culture is front and center. Now, filmmaker Morgan Spurlock, the man behind Supersize Me and Where in the World is Osama Bin Laden?, has opted to explore that world.
Book worms · Comic gurus, including President of Mile High Comics Chuck Rozanski (above), offer their expert opinions on the industry and the ins and outs of the convention in the new documentary Comic-Con. - Photo courtesy of Strategy PR
An immersive director, Spurlock always gives a very personal, human spin to his films. That said, this should be the best look into the Comic-Con experience, right?
The documentary, however, never quite catches its footing. Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan’s Hope is, at best, uneven.
The movie is sharply put together, with good visuals and a nice selection of interviewees from the various niches of the convention, but it can’t seem to decide what kind of movie it wants to be.
For the most part, the film follows five convention-goers and their struggles throughout the event. There are two amateur but talented artists looking to break into the industry, a costume designer entering into the annual masquerade with her friends and a retailer looking for big sales to help his company.
Though engaging, the storylines are limited and only focus on small aspects of the overall Comic-Con experience. Even the subplot with a convention fan who is planning on proposing fails to really expand the narrative’s scope. The main convention just feels like a secondary element to the movie.
Sincerity is the film’s biggest problem. Though the movie never outright insults the people featured in it, Comic-Con still focuses on crazy costumes, awkward social scenes and stereotypical nerd elements. The film feels like it was made to mock Comic-Con fans.
And it’s not the fault of poor editing or direction — it’s just a bit of poor taste from the filmmakers. Well-paced and structured to give an appropriate introduction to Comic-Con, the film draws audiences in. And the depiction of Comic-Con’s subjects gets better near the end as the film tries to offer an emotional finale. It still it comes off as forced, however, because of the way the film is edited together.
That’s due in part to Spurlock’s physical, on-screen absence from the film. In his past works, Spurlock has been a presence on camera, offering a human face and serving as a kind of filmic Watson or as an analogue for the uninitiated viewer. Here, despite directing the film, he isn’t on camera and doesn’t provide a voiceover, which might explain the film’s distant feel.
Beyond the narratives, the film also features a number of interviews with comic book creators, such as Matt Fraction, and filmmakers, such as Joss Whedon. But with the somewhat mocking tone the film takes with its lead characters, these people — even over-the-top personalities like Kevin Smith — oddly end up coming across as the true, level-headed defenders of Comic-Con.
Though these segments are isolated from the convention, they serve as the film’s highlights — giving a sense of what makes Comic-Con so important and likable. But with these faults, the film is well-made. Any filmmaker who can make a movie in the crowded chaos that is Comic-Con has accomplished an impressive feat.
Though the film tackles a difficult subject to film, Comic-Con doesn’t really give one a feel of being inside the convention center, it still feels as if one is only in the periphery. It’s as if the documentary is looking in on the convention, rather than being a part of it.
But even if the film never grasps a good sense of the convention, it’s still a visually enjoyable feature.
The movie flaunts plenty of interesting effects and montages. One noteworthy recurring element is that it transitions between scenes that show off animation designed to simulate the look of a comic book. It’s something that’s been done in movies and television shows before, but here it actually looks good, rather than merely distracting.
Comic-Con tries to offer a look into one of the biggest media events in the world but, unfortunately, ends up only giving viewers a cursory glance. The film has its entertaining moments, but they’re countered by uneven pacing and a mocking tone that leaves the film feeling uncertain of what it’s trying to do.

In the world of street art, virtually anything goes.
The streets have become a canvas for artists working in a variety of media, whether it be spray paint, stickers or wheatpaste. Little by little, these artists’ chosen works and styles help them create their street cred — and maybe, one day, a path to their own formal gallery shows.
For L.A.-based artist Free Humanity, the streets provide a platform for sharing positive ideas and information. As Free’s website states, his art focuses on “taking back the humanity stolen from our minds by social manipulation and planting seeds of positivity through art and consciousness.”
Avid street fans and casual passers-by can spot Free’s art on the streets of Los Angeles, with his work ranging from small posters to large murals. One of his trademark images is a lotus flower with a diamond emerging from it, but his style proves easy to spot even when he chooses other subjects, including entertainment icons like Michael Jackson.
And though his work has gained fame on the streets, Free traces his love of art to a very early age, before he could even roam outdoors.
“I started finger painting on my walls at six months old,” Free said.
Free identifies one of his signature pieces as the “Peace Lotus Girl,” an image of a girl with only her eyes showing behind a scarf and the words “Free Humanity” emblazoned along the bottom. The work was inspired by a photograph of his significant other, which he then sketched and transformed into the work it is today. Free describes this as his favorite work, done with what he calls a “pixel and drip effect.”
Bigger works, including a mural featuring the face of Audrey Hepburn with a quote from the actress stating “the best thing to hold onto in life is each other,” show off Free’s versatility while maintaining his familiar colors and pixelation.
As the city streets began to house more of his work, Free’s fan base grew. Klerkx Art Agency recently signed Free, and West Hollywood’s Maximillian Gallery hosted his first solo, pop-up art show last Thursday.
“I’ve always wanted to do a solo show,” Free said. “Full control is hard to come by with galleries. I’ve done a few shows — one in London and mostly in and around L.A.”
As with many street artists, Free’s success mostly depended on his tenacity and ability to get the attention of complete strangers walking the city streets.
“The ‘Diamond in the Lotus’ was made about two years ago, but I’ve worked harder on getting out in the public recently,” Free said. “I post my work everywhere and anywhere.”
Free also recognizes the figures that inspired his work, from the street artists Cryptik and Alec Monopoly to the performance artist Zhang Huan. In this vein, Free also appreciates being signed by an art agency that represents artists he respects.
“It’s a huge honor to be selected by Klerkx Art Agency, [which] represents artists from the likes of Icy and Sot from Iran, street artists that focus on human rights by using images of vulnerable people in society and John Fekner, one of the first stencil artists of the ’70s,” Free said.
His show not only displayed his works but gave visitors a chance to show their own talent and possibly win some art. Visitors were given the opportunity to place a postcard with their best version of Free’s work and get the chance to win a piece.
As for anyone interested in pursuing art for themselves, Free advises aspiring artists to create truly meaningful pieces.
“Art should delight and inform, inside or outside,” Free said.
Free’s works merge this philosophy with a genuine love of art. In the end, Free wants visitors to experience art in simple terms:
“Hopefully, something that at least makes someone smile,” Free said.

Since its founding in 1990, Teach for America has become an attractive post-graduate option for college students. The program has placed more than 33,000 graduates as teachers in low-income schools.
Inspired by Teach for America’s model, a new organization, Venture for America, is looking to develop the next generation of entrepreneurs. It is a promising organization whose ambitious goals of job creation and community revitilization should be praised.
Finance and consulting are considered the most highly sought-after career paths for business majors. Complete with generous entry-level paychecks and stable career progressions, these careers typically snatch up the brightest college graduates. As a result, the start-up realm is often neglected. The problem is especially pronounced outside of start-up-friendly areas such as Los Angeles and the Silicon Valley.
To alleviate this problem, Venture for America recruits college seniors to work at start-ups in struggling cities for two years. Founded last summer by serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, the program plans to place 50 fellows at start-ups and early stage companies in Detroit, New Orleans and Providence, R.I., in its inaugural year.
In addition to providing its fellows with support and resources, such as a five-week introductory boot camp, Venture for America will help struggling cities that might not have attracted top talent otherwise. There is no guarantee, however, that graduates will stay in these cities when their two years are up.
Venture for America should work on providing incentives for fellows to stay in the communities. It should give fellows extensive opportunities for alumni networking and support. Still, Venture for America does come with a natural incentive: If you were to grow a company for two years and witness its burgeoning success, would you really want to leave?
Flaws aside, Venture for America is doing something different and bold. If the program can ease students’ doubts, provide them with adequate support and lead them to pursue entrepreneurship rather than taking the safer, uninspired path, that’s certainly something to celebrate.

The story of a football game doesn’t end with a mark in the win/lose column.
The story ends 30 years later, when a victorious receiver’s life takes a hypothetical turn for the worse.
After a successful football career and numerous concussions, this player develops early-onset Alzheimer’s and forgets his wife’s name — or he becomes depressed and maybe even suicidal.
Jovanna Tesollo | Daily Trojan
This receiver is a hypothetical example, but there are numerous real-life cases of former NFL players whose lives have been irreversibly altered as a result of concussions induced by football injuries.
Andre “Dirty” Waters, a defensive back who played for 12 years in the NFL, was renowned for his hard hits. He retired in 1995 and dropped off the grid until 2006, when he shot himself in the head.
On the HBO show Real Sports, a doctor, Bennet Omalu, analyzed Waters’ brain. Omalu said that Waters’ brain was like one of an 85-year-old man and exhibited symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. He died when he was 44 years old.
Omalu also examined the brains of two former Pittsburgh Steelers players, Terry Long and Mike Webster.  Both Long and Webster died young, had severe emotional problems and were found to have much older brains, like that of Waters.
Dr. Robert Cantu, a sports concussions expert, found that former NFL players who had at least three concussions were three times more likely to be clinically depressed and five times more likely to have pre-Alzheimer’s.
In the face of such findings, it is easy to assign blame to NFL players — surely they must know the risks they take by playing football. But no warning is given to NFL players before joining the league. More importantly, the NFL still maintains that there is no evidence linking concussions and long-term health problems.
Publicly acknowledging this link and advising players about it is necessary — and not just in the NFL.
According to a study published last year in Neurosurgery, high school football players who suffered two or more concussions reported health problems, including headaches, dizziness and sleeping issues, at much higher rates.
The warning signs are there. But the NFL is reluctant to acknowledge what is now a problem — one that might soon balloon into an epidemic.
The NFL isn’t the only one. We, the fans, still cheer our football team on. We root for the big hits and not the cart-offs. We cheer for the sacks, but not when a player can’t get up. At the end of the day, what matters most to fans is whether their team wins or loses.
The story of a football game doesn’t end at the close of the fourth quarter. College students — fans and players alike — should keep that in mind. College administrations should also make sure that each season, their teams are informed about how the stories of the Andre Waters and Terry Longs of the football world ended.
The American public can no longer be slow to acknowledge a fatal flaw in its most beloved game.
