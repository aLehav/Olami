He is largely responsible for the most productive special teams unit over the last eight years, and now, he’s a part of the USC staff.
John Baxter, formerly the special teams coordinator for Fresno State was reportedly added to coach Lane Kiffin’s staff on Wednesday, continuing to fill Kiffin’s coaching squad.
Baxter led the Bulldogs’ special teams unit to an NCAA-best 49 blocked kicks over the past eight seasons, a statistic that garnered the coach recognition and obviously caught Kiffin’s eye when the time came for him to find a special teams coach.
Baxter was also responsible for instituting a program at Fresno State that gave the team a national reputation as one of the most academically responsible programs in the country.
His “Academic Gameplan” has resulted in Fresno State leading the Western Athletic Conference in Academic All-WAC players, who are required to have at least a 3.0 GPA and play in half of the team’s games.
Baxter had previously coach at Tulane (1994-96), Maryland (1992-93) and Arizona (1990-91, 1988) before joining the Bulldog staff.

Kevin Brereton, also known by his stage name k-os, is a Canadian alternative hip-hop artist that has yet to cultivate a substantial following in the United States.
4321 · Yes! is the fourth full-length album from Toronto native k-os. - Photo courtesy of Astralwerks Records 
This might be expected if k-os was an average artist of average talent or if he was simply a carbon copy of the current stars of alternative hip-hop. As his groundbreaking album Yes! shows, however, neither of these hypotheticals is even close to the truth.
Most Americans wouldn’t recognize his name if they heard it, which is unfortunate, considering the gem that is his most recent album, Yes!. His songwriting is ambitious in both breadth and depth and all his songs are executed brilliantly, combining to form an album that is both varied yet consistent in its vision.
The album starts with “Zambony,” a song that’s already a step away from convention. The track is immediately somber and soulful — an unorthodox way to introduce a hip-hop album — and is dominated by choral vocals that paint a solemn background for Brereton’s razor-sharp lyricism. k-os’ ear for complex arrangements is immediately evident, as gritty synthesizers and dramatic strings weave in and out, lifting the track from monotony.
“Astronaut” shows its genius only after a few attentive listens.
Beginning with a sample of Neil Armstrong’s voice, the song bursts with frenetic energy. A stuttering snare track backs what can only be described as a musical interpretation of abstract art — borderline bewildering but beautiful at the same time. It’s refreshing to hear a song without a contrived, Auto-Tuned hook from its chorus, instead relying on the strengths of the composition to shine.
“Burning Bridges” is where the album really begins to show off k-os’ ability to put the “alternative” in alternative hip-hop. Where others only dabble with more varied arrangements and choruses, k-os dives in fully, embracing an obvious love of — among other genres — indie rock and baroque pop. The song showcases his impressive singing voice; one can easily imagine him as a legitimate front man for an indie band with this sort of ability. Not only does he craft a solidly melodic exercise in alternative rock, he does so while retaining a hip-hop sensibility, letting his rap abilities guest star in a primarily sung piece.
“Uptown Girl” follows this blend of rock and hip-hop, where Brereton brings the lyrical heat over the somewhat Middle Eastern-sounding guitar line from Nirvana’s “Love Buzz.”
And then Yes! reveals the single most glaring example of why it’s unfathomable that k-os has not charted in America — the confusingly titled, but brilliantly crafted, “I Wish I Knew Natalie Portman.” It samples the already catchy chorus of Phantom Planet’s “California,” and sets up one of the best hooks in post-modern hip-hop history. It’s airwave-ready without being dumb or silly; the song’s concept of being on the run from the past is worlds apart from so many songs that take the girls-and-clubs route of lyricism.
Other highlights include “4321,” which is reminiscent of old-school alternative rap like the early work of The Roots, its mellow, jazz-tinged sound revived to a more upbeat pulse. “The Aviator” is a riveting reflection of imperfect progression through life, Brereton muses, Let the sermon begin, hail observant again / Watchin’ my mind spin / Watchin’ how time can turn enemies into friends.
“Mr. Telephone Man” puts bombastic bass and snare percussion with some of the most red-hot rapping this side of Eminem. Classical piano work swirls in the background while telephone beeps ring alongside.
The only true criticism might be the seeming randomness of influences and the expression of the “alternative” aspect — some songs are more rock, others not. But with a patient listen of the entire album, it somehow gels together and makes a lot of sense; the uniqueness of the tracks simply build upon each other, in the process making a very unique album.
To any devotee of hip-hop, today’s scene can seem simultaneously encouraging and depressing. There are more than a few talented artists, especially in the alternative rap scene, but, for every progressive artist, there’s one hustling in the mainstream, dealing exclusively with the conventional and the superficial.
The future success or failure of an artist like k-os might say a lot about our musical indoctrination these days, but it’s comforting to know that for every rapper content with rhyming “I miss you” with “I really wanna kiss you,” there’s another artist with some actual vision and ability.
Life and death they roll in Siamese twins / so the day that hip hop dies another life can begin, Brereton notes. Hopefully true, but, as long as there are musicians like k-os around, true hip-hop will always soldier on.
On campus I heard this whiteboy spittin’ his lyrics while the other beat-boxed…off the chains if you ask me.

Last August, I was packing my bags in preparation to start at USC when I realized that I really did not know Los Angeles. I had been visiting family in Southern California for years, but I really didn’t know what it was like to live in the city. I was coming from the suburbs of Atlanta, and I was going to be living in the center of one of the biggest metropolitan areas in the country — yet I hardly knew of anything to do there.
Being the geek that I am, I turned to the Internet for help.
It turns out that Los Angeles has one of the most vibrant online scenes in the nation. There are sites covering every aspect of life in the city, from food to events to technology and more. A quick search can reveal more about Los Angeles than any travel book or Hollywood Walk of Fame tour ever could.
Los Angeles isn’t the first city to have an abundance of city-specific websites, but it is the spread out metropolis of Los Angeles that benefits from them most.
“I saw a very unique culture brewing here in Los Angeles around the local start-up and technology scene,” said Sean Percival, founder of lalawag.com, a site about L.A. culture with a focus on new media. “We love to build product and create content here, and in many cases it’s better than anything else in the world.”
Sadly, the media tends to show Los Angeles as the home of Hollywood, celebrities and little else. Luckily, there are more than a few sites that highlight lesser known aspects of the city.
In addition to lalwag.com, which features weekly guides to local events, there is Hidden Los Angeles (hiddenLA.com) and the Los Angeles Visionaries Association (lavatransforms.org).
The two sites list events for lesser known parts of the city, celebrations for cultural landmarks and guides to the arts in Los Angeles.
“With services like Twitter, Facebook and MySpace, few things are hidden these days,” Percival said. “These next-generation oversharing platforms really tend to shine a light on even the most hidden parts of L.A.”
Oversharing platforms are useful in Los Angeles, which is home to a unique food scene. There is an amazing blend of ethnic cuisines, great farmers markets and a food truck culture to rival Portland’s. But since mobile eateries are always on the go, they can be hard to find. Better than following each individual company on Twitter, foodies can utilize some of the Internet’s more comprehensive quick guides. Clustertruck.org offers a live map of the locations of different food trucks, while findlafoodtrucks.com compiles all of the Twitter feeds for the eateries in one site. When you’re hungry and on the go, these can be pretty invaluable resources.
Though these websites might come across as a fad cashing in on the new media craze, Los Angeles’ Internet scene is sincere. It isn’t a bunch of corporations distantly reporting on the goings-on of the city; most are run by people who live in Los Angeles and want to share some of their favorite things with peers. It is the ultimate way to get a local’s opinion on something.
“That’s the great thing about building for the web,” Percival said. “It’s so easy to take your idea from the drawing board to the computer screen and then right to market. Rome wasn’t built in a day, but many websites are.”
And Los Angeles’ Internet culture is just beginning. Social networking is continuing to evolve, and more and more businesses are realizing that they can attract a whole new clientele through the web.
“I see more events, more communities and more start-ups launching here our great city,” Percival said. “In addition to being known for being a great hub for content, I see L.A. starting to earn its pedigree on the product and tech side as well. Along the way, I hope to see the unique style and culture of L.A. continue to influence our direction and the work we do.”
I came into USC pretty clueless about the city, but I’ve managed to find a lot of interesting and unusual events by looking past the tourist traps and clichés. So if you are still trying to figure out Los Angeles or if you want to explore an aspect of the city you haven’t checked out, take a look at what the Internet has to say. It may surprise you and put a whole new spin on the City of Angels.

The USC women’s golf team took full advantage of a chance to rebound after a sub-par 12th-place performance at last week’s Wildcat Invitational, storming back to win the Bruin Wave Invitational on Wednesday.
Even · Sophomore Jennifer Song shot even par in the final round. - Courtesy of USC Sports Information 
Down four strokes with one round to go, the Women of Troy combined for a 2-under-par 288 to win the UCLA- and Pepperdine-hosted event taking advantage of some uneven play from the hosts who were both in contention for the tournament title.
Arizona State, who was fourth after the second round, finished second, two strokes behind the Women of Troy, despite firing a 4-over-par 294 on the first day of play.
On a beautiful day for a round of golf, none of the Women of Troy shot a round less than 3-over-par, including junior Lizette Salas, who finished the day with at team-best 1-under-par 71. Salas finished the individual tournament tied for fourth overall at a 2-under-par 214 (72-71-71).
Senior Belen Mozo and sophomore Jennifer Song shot even-par 72s on Wednesday, and both finished in the top 10 in the individual event. Mozo started her round with 16 consecutive pars before she birdied the 17th and bogied on the 18th hole.
Song had a more tumultuous day, ending the first 11 holes 4 under par before a bumpy back nine brought the sophomore back to even par for the round.
The earlier rounds for the Women of Troy were equally successful as they positioned themselves for a final round comeback to capture the Bruin Wave.
In the first round, Mozo shot a 4-under-par 68 that helped USC finish 2 under par for the opening round.
Mozo’s 68 was the 13th round of her career under 70, which set a USC career mark, eclipsing former Trojan Irene Cho and Song, who both have 12 sub-70 rounds.
Freshman Cyna Rodriguez also played well on the opening day of competition, carding a round of 1-over-par 73, which included four birdies.
The second round was not quite as forgiving for any of the teams at the Bruin Wave, as USC shot a combined 6-over-par 294 and was the leader after the second round. UCLA was only able to muster a two-under-par 290. Pepperdine, who finished the second round tied with the Women of Troy at an even 598, shot a 2-over-par on the day.
The second round was Salas’, as the sophomore made her move from a tie for 11th after the first round to a tie for fifth after shooting a 1-under-par 71 that included a 2-under-par front nine and birdies on 17 and 18.
Song also improved on the second day, shooting an even-par 72, which could have been even better if she didn’t have a late round stretch of 3-over-par that included a double bogey.
The victory gives the Women of Troy three victories on the season and two wins in just three tournaments this spring.
USC will head into a nearly month-long break before it plays in the PING/Arizona State Invitational in April.

The UCLA women’s tennis team outshined USC on Wednesday in a nail-biter match that lasted more than five hours at Marks Tennis Stadium on Wednesday.
Turn around · After dropping a close first set 5-7 in her singles match, junior Maria Sanchez took the second set 6-3 and cruised to a 6-1 final set victory. Sanchez improves her singles record to 9-1 on the season. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
With No. 4 UCLA (12-1) up 3-1 in the match, No. 12 USC (7-4) needed wins in the last three singles matches to beat its crosstown rival. Those three remaining singles matches were as close as could be, with all of them going to three sets. But in the end, USC couldn’t complete the comeback. Though USC was able to tie at 3-3, the team couldn’t get the last singles match to tally in the win.
“It would have been a big boost for us, no question,” USC coach Richard Gallien told USCTrojans.com. “But you lick your wounds and go on”
The match began with UCLA easily pocketing two doubles victories on the top two courts. The doubles point was already secured by UCLA when USC’s third-seeded duo, junior Cristala Andrews and freshman Valeria Pulido, won 8-6 in the third match.
In singles, things began to pick up for the Women of Troy. No. 21 sophomore Alison Ramos of USC started the team strong with a smooth win over No. 7 Noelle Hickey 6-2, 6-3.
The remaining five matches were close throughout play. On court six, Andrews fell 5-7, 3-6, and soon after senior Sarah Fansler was also taken down 4-6, 2-6 on court four.
The remaining three USC players all lost to their opponents in the first set, so to win the match all of them needed to notch victories in three sets.
On the top court, No. 3 junior Maria Sanchez, who was also honored as Pac-10 Player of the Week last week, outperformed UCLA’s No. 5 Yasmin Schnack.
Despite losing the first set 5-7, Sanchez fought back to take the second set 6-3. Schnack couldn’t stay focused, and Sanchez took advantage and started the third set by winning seven straight points. Sanchez took the third set rather easily 6-1. It was a back-to-back three-set-match win that improved Sanchez’s singles record to 9-1. On the fifth court, Pulido fell in the first set to UCLA’s Stephanie Hoffpauir in a tiebreaker that ended 7-9 in Hoffpauir’s favor. Pulido answered back by handling Hoffpauir in the second set 6-1. In a neck-and-neck battle for the third set, Pulido edged her opponent 7-5, capturing the victory and tying the match at 3-3.
Everyone’s attention now turned to court two where No. 22 freshman Danielle Lao was challenging UCLA’s No. 34 Andrea Remynse.
Each point was hard fought, as many games could have gone in either direction. Remynse took the first set 4-6, but Lao remained calm even when down 4-5 in the second set. Lao ended up taking the last three games of the second set to tie it up at one set apiece.
The third set was tight, and Lao had the edge over Remynse at 4-3. Still, Lao couldn’t finish her opponent and was defeated 6-4 in the third set, giving UCLA the match victory.

Pete Carroll always used to joke that he refused to divulge Taylor Mays’ 40-yard dash time because no one would believe him if he did.
I guess now we’ll never know the truth.
The answer was supposed to be finally revealed once and for all Tuesday at the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis. It looked for a minute as though Mays had delivered that jaw-dropping moment when it was announced he had recorded a 4.24 second 40-yard dash, which would have tied the record mark set by Tennessee Titans running back Chris Johnson in 2008.
But that listing was unofficial. Mays true mark was announced as 4.43 seconds, leaving everyone in the Lucas Oil Stadium befuddled. Timing can vary by a few hundredths of a second depending on who’s holding the stopwatch. But how does someone’s speed vary by two-tenths of a second?
There was a certain disappointment that lingered once the more reasonable time was announced. If the 6-foot-3, 230-pound Mays had truly run a 4.24, he would have gone down in history as one of the best combine performers of all time. Now he only gets the benefit of being labeled as one of your run-of-the-mill elite physical specimens.
Mays’ mark was still the best among defensive backs, but it’s easy to see why he would be disappointed with the new mark. It’s the equivalent of getting a 101 on your test only to have your professor take it back and regrade it as an 89. Sure, there’s some estimation involved, but there’s no accounting for such a discrepancy.
Cameras superimposed Mays’ run against those of other speedy prospects, leading to the conclusion that the former USC safety had to have run faster than the official time with which he was credited. In all likelihood, it will be a great mystery until everyone forgets about it in roughly a week.
But “40-gate” reinforced an important point: The NFL Draft focuses more on a collection of perceptions than it does exact information.
From the outside, the NFL draft is a neurotic organizer’s dream. Everything has to be categorized, ranked and sorted. Teams and analysts ramble about what they claim to definitively know. If someone is picked too high or too low or above another player, there must be immediate, inherently justified outrage.
But the truth is that there is no true sorting system for the NFL draft. The lack of predictability is what makes the event, when stripped of its hype, so enjoyable.
Many of our perceptions are not entirely based on criteria that accurately predict the success of future NFL players. How else would you describe JaMarcus Russell’s ascension to No. 1 overall draft pick despite a litany of questions about his ability to lead a team and make good decisions? Oh right, you could account for it by mentioning that he was drafted by the Oakland Raiders.
But there are plenty of other examples. The Miami Dolphins drafted wide receiver Ted Ginn Jr., ninth overall despite the fact that he had the notable handicap of struggling to catch the ball, which ranks pretty highly on the things you would want from a player of his position.
Teams, fans and analysts develop perceptions of players that evolve throughout the draft process. Of course, teams get in trouble when their perceptions of a flawed but talented player begin to drift away from the facts.
When looking at a player with an obvious upside but significant problems, teams almost act like girls who think they can fix that troubled guy they like so much. He’ll change, they say, once I get a crack at him. And of course, they end up getting burned.
But no matter what the team’s objective, it’s clear those perceptions matter more than the raw data.
So what’s the perception that followed Mays after the draft? Well, it is probably that he is capable of moving extremely fast in one direction, especially for a player of his size ­— insightful analysis, right?
I limit the statement at that because there are still questions about Mays that concern teams. Tony Pauline of Sports Illustrated wrote that Mays “was in bad form” during defensive back drills and showed poor fundamentals. And fairly or unfairly, Mays is now battling the reputation that he’s a workout warrior who still needs polishing.
Mays will get another chance to change teams’ opinion of him when he performs at USC’s pro day at the end of the month. The comfortable setting should give him the opportunity to show off his skills in the best possible context.
At the very least, he should give us another 40 time to talk about.

After escaping Oregon with two close victories, the Women of Troy ride a three-game winning streak back to the Galen Center to wrap up their final homestand of the regular season against the Arizona schools.
Improve · Sophomore forward Briana Gilbreath struggled against Oregon State in USC’s 53-50 win and looks to improve this weekend. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“We’re definitely focused now, and these next two games are must-wins,” senior guard Hailey Dunham said. “But we’re just focused on Arizona now, and we’re just taking it one game at a time.”
With the Pac-10 tournament about a week away, the Women of Troy (16-11, 10-6) are currently fourth in the conference standings but can still capture third place with a good showing in the next two games.
All they need to do is take care of what they can control.
“Our goal is in our own hands and our destiny is where we want it to be at this particular time,” USC coach Michael Cooper said. “For us to be right where we talked about since day one is very [good].”
Standing in their way will be the Arizona Wildcats (13-14, 6-10), who managed to erase a 20-point deficit in the first meeting and force overtime.
Fortunately, the Women of Troy were able to escape Tempe, Ariz., with a narrow 81-78 victory.
This time around they know they will need to do a better job especially on the defensive glass.
Wildcats forward Ify Ibekwe leads the conference in rebounding, and keeping her off the glass will be a challenge for the Women of Troy.
“We gotta rebound,” Cooper said. “It’s been our Achilles’ heel all season long, but, if we’re going to get to where we want to go, eventually we’re going to have to be a good rebounding team.”
Not only will they have their hands full rebounding the ball, but the Wildcats also have three scorers averaging double figures in points. Slowing them down offensively will be no easy task.
“Our defense has been pretty consistent throughout the year,” Cooper said. “If we can [contain] those three scorers, we’ll be successful.”
For the Women of Troy, four seniors will be playing their final regular season home games at the Galen Center.
Dunham, along with senior guard/forward Aarika Hughes and senior guards Heather Oliver and Daniela Roark will be honored in a ceremony at Saturday’s game against Arizona State.
But to end their Women of Troy careers, they want nothing more than to finish the season strong and have a chance at playing in March. 
“We know if we want to get to the NCAA tournament, we’re going to have to get these next two games,” Oliver said. “Not only are we emphasizing winning, but we have to come out with a passion and be confident in the way we play.”
Thursday’s tip-off is scheduled for 7 p.m.

By now it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the USC men’s basketball team has nothing left to play for.
Different goals · Senior guard Dwight Lewis and the Trojans are aware of their ability to play bubble-buster for their two remaining opponents. The Trojans travel to Arizona State on Thursday looking to hand the Sun Devils their tenth loss on the season. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
Even before its loss to Oregon State last weekend, the Trojans (16-12, 8-8) were barred from earning a share of the Pac-10 regular-season title when California defeated Arizona State on Saturday.
“We were playing for a tangible goal of some sort,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “Now, we don’t have any of that.”
The team has just two games left on its schedule and will not be competing in the postseason because of university-imposed sanctions. To top it off, the Trojans have lost three consecutive games, including two at home.
But none of this means they can’t ruin things for someone else.
Tonight’s matchup at Arizona State (20-9, 10-6) offers USC more than just an opportunity to snap its current losing streak. Beating the Sun Devils would deny them their own shot at sharing the conference title. Arizona State needs to win its last two games, against both Los Angeles schools, and have California lose its final game to tie the Bears at season’s end.
“Maybe we can mess them up,” said senior guard Dwight Lewis, smiling. “Be bubble bursters or something.”
Lewis’ speculation could become reality if the Trojans play like they did in the team’s last meeting. In the Jan. 2 game at the Galen Center, USC rode a suffocating defensive effort to a 47-37 victory, holding the Sun Devils to just 11 field goals on 24 percent shooting.
The Trojans have had offensive problems of their own, especially in recent weeks. USC’s point totals in its last three games — 47, 44 and 44 — have dropped it to last in the Pac-10 in scoring offense.
O’Neill attributed the team’s struggles in part to fatigue.
“We’ve had a bunch of guys play minutes they’ve never had to do before,” he said. “It’s certainly not an excuse for losing games at home, but at the same time we have not played with the same oomph for the last couple games in terms of offense.”
Fortunately for the Trojans, defense hasn’t been an issue. USC comes into tonight’s game allowing only 56.1 points per game, third best in the nation.
The Trojans look to bring more of the same against Arizona State’s balanced scoring attack. Guard Ty Abbott leads the Sun Devils at 12.3 points per game, while forward Rihards Kuksiks and guard Derek Glasser average in double figures as well.
But USC can’t afford to be one-sided against an Arizona State team that has played well of late. Before falling to California last weekend, the Sun Devils had won four in a row.
“We haven’t shot the ball well at all the last three games,” O’Neill said.
The Trojans hope that changes tonight.
“Play for pride now,” Lewis said. “No one wants to end the season a loser.”

Aside from young adult fantasy novels, it seems like comic books are the main source of material for original Hollywood screenplays these days. But while most of those adaptations focus on superheroes, the industry has also been good at showcasing comics of other genres — the latest being Vertigo’s The Losers.
Jen Lee | Daily Trojan
The original idea for The Losers started in the 1970s when the characters appeared in DC Comics’ war-anthology series Our Fighting Forces. Telling the story of a World War II Special Forces unit, The Losers was made up of somewhat cliché figures from different branches of the armed forces.
In 2003, DC Comics invited writer Andy Diggle and artist Jock to revamp the concept for DC imprint Vertigo. While he was originally approached by DC to give a gritty take on The Losers, Diggle decided to take the concept out of the war and bring it into the modern day.
“After batting some ideas around, we decided to ditch the old DC concept and just invent something completely new,” Diggle said.
Instead of a gritty World War II story, the new Losers tells the story of a Special Forces team set up by its CIA handler Max and left for dead after uncovering an agency secret. After emerging from hiding, the members decide to literally steal their lives back.
Gone were the military clichés. Instead, Diggle made the series a cross between a spy thriller, a heist film and a high-octane action movie. With an entertaining cast, exotic locations and a great mystery driving the revenge aspect of the series, The Losers’ revitalization was unlike anything else on the market.
The story is sharp, but what makes the series really work is the art. Jock’s style can only be described as kinetic. The action pops off the page, and each panel feels like a frame of a storyboard for an action movie, only crisper and more vibrant. The art perfectly complements the story, and Jock mixes a unique, realistic look for the interiors and a stylistic feel for the covers.
The result is a book that looks like nothing else on the market. For Diggle, that’s because of the friendship he shares with Jock.
“We love working together,” Diggle said. “We’ve got to the point where we can just predict each other’s moves, which makes for a great sort of shorthand working relationship. He just gets where I’m coming from. It’s always jarring working with another artist who might not get it. Jock’s just got this innate sense of dramatic storytelling; he knows which moments to really sell to the reader.”
With a series as sharp as The Losers, it’s no surprise that it was adapted for the big screen. Although the film release has been pushed back to April 23, the trailers for the Sylvain White-directed film look very true to the comic, with some scenes lifted straight from the pages.
The cast includes Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana and Chris Evans. Each actor just seems right for the part, whether it’s Morgan’s gruff determination as the leader, Clay, or Evans’ sarcastic remarks as the team’s hacker, Jensen.
“Jock and I didn’t have any official input [to the film], but the director is a fan of the comic, and he’s keeping it very faithful to the look and tone of our work,” Diggle said. “He’s following Jock’s character designs very closely, and I helped them iron out some plot points in an unofficial capacity.”
While fans of the comic series know that The Losers is a unique story, the general public might be making comparisons to The A-Team, whose big screen adaptation hits theaters two months after The Losers. Despite this, Diggle is positive The Losers’ uniqueness will win out.
“It’s funny, when I wrote my first pitch for The Losers, I showed it to my best friend Rich who said, ‘It’s kind of like The A-Team, isn’t it?’” Diggle said. “And of course I told him it was totally different. The A-Team were mercenaries for hire by the general public, whereas the Losers are on a self-motivated mission to leverage their names off a CIA death list.”
For Diggle, influence came more from neo-noir thrillers than 1980s television shows.
“The Losers comic is much harder-edged, more political, darker, more adult than The A-Team TV series, which was, let’s face it, meant for kids,” Diggle said. “I was consciously channeling movies like Three Kings, The Way of the Gun, Heat, Ronin, stuff like that.”
The Losers is a smart, tense thriller of a comic, and one of the great examples of what the medium can accomplish. If the film is half as good as the comics — and it looks to be — then audiences are in for a treat.

Two major earthquakes have devastated Haiti and Chile in the last two months. Thousands have died and many more displaced with destruction overtaking the respective countries. One country was better equipped than the other for these natural disasters, but both quakes have left residents with a lack of resources necessary for survival — raising the question, should one life outweigh another?
Between 200,000 and 250,000 people died in Haiti and more than 1 million were displaced, according to the Wall Street Journal. It’s estimated that the country suffered more than $8.1 billion in damages. Millions of Americans have sympathetically risen to the occasion and donated millions of dollars to Haiti since the 7.0-magnitude earthquake occurred in January. USC students have also done their part by assembling relief kits for survivors and hosting benefit events.
Because Haiti is a developing country and did not have the resources to prepare itself for an earthquake, it suffered greater consequences than Chile.
Despite the differences in damage, Chileans are still in great need of resources and should not be neglected; nearly 800 people died in last week’s 8.8-magnitude earthquake. The Wall Street Journal said the Feb. 27 earthquake has been deemed one of the largest earthquakes in a century. So why aren’t people coming to Chile’s rescue like they did for Haiti?
Could the lack in motivation be caused by the economic downturn and a depletion of resources after Americans gave their extra money to Haiti?
Doubtful — people kindly donated whatever they could to Haiti by calling, text messaging and sending checks to the Red Cross and other relief organizations.
“I think enough of us have, even through a recession, some disposable income that we can contribute to … Chile,” said Justin Lacey, a junior majoring in finance and accounting.
“I think that people do whatever their hearts tell them to do,” said Taira Sims, an undecided freshman.
Thomas Curry | Daily Trojan
CNN reported that actor George Clooney helped organize a benefit telethon, which aired on more than 25 networks and raised millions of dollars, to encourage Americans to donate money to Haiti.
Between 130 and 140 celebrities performed and picked up telephones at the event, Clooney told The Associated Press.
“The main thing about charity is that if you make it cool anyone will do anything,” said Jack Robbins, a junior majoring in cinema-television production. “I gave half a grand to Haiti because Radiohead made a concert and I went. If there’s a smart marketing campaign like there was for Haiti, anything is possible.”
It has been almost a week since the earthquake, so why haven’t I heard of any events taking place to help Chilean victims recover?
Commercials are not encouraging me to text a number in order to donate $10 to Chile, and news stations have not put a number at the bottom of the screen to spur donations. USC residence halls are collecting materials to help Haiti but not Chile. What’s the deal? Do we really need to be told by celebrities to help out?
At an event hosted at Ground Zero Performance Café  on Tuesday night, USC students took the bull by the horns and made contributions to both Haiti and Chile.
According to Glen Hsia, a senior majoring in music industry and one of the event’s organizers, the event featured student musicians and asked for donations to the American Red Cross and Invisible Children, an organization that benefits poverty-stricken children in Africa. Students had the choice of making donations to either Haiti or Chile, or specifically to the American Red Cross or Invisible Children.
As of yesterday, the American Red Cross is accepting donations specifically for Chile and has upped its initial pledge of $50,000 to $250,000. That’s a start.
Although the devastation in Chile cannot be equated with that in Haiti by any means, Chile still deserves the same kind of outpouring of aid witnessed in the response to the earthquake in Haiti. Chile’s buildings and infrastructure generally remained intact whereas Haiti’s were demolished, but 800 Chilean deaths is still too large a number to ignore. The need for aid in Chile, in addition to that in Haiti, must be recognized.
There is still a great demand for resources to assist both countries. The Ground Zero event is one of the first I have noticed on campus that is raising money for Chile as well as Haiti.
Hopefully in the next few days higher profile organizations will follow suit.

**to make PEOPLE pay any attention
Do you ever do research before you write your articles?
This shows how little understanding you have of the way internatiuonal aid actually works. You can’t just throw money and donated clothes at a country as soon as a disaster happens. Before anything can be done, the country has to actually ask for and *accept* offered help. There are teams of doctors, aid workers, relief aid, and volunteers literally waiting for the call to depart for Chile. But that call has to come in before those resources can be mobilized.
Chile is significantly wealthier than Haiti, so no, they don’t need the same outpouring of donations. Do they deserve it? Yes, of course. There are thousands of worthy causes out there that desperately need and deserve an outpouring of donations and aid. Human trafficking and domestic violence destroy hundreds of thousands of lives every year. Fistulas and obstructed labor kill hundreds of thousands of women in Africa. Disease, war, famine, abuse, etc are affecting millions. These are all desperate situations. And they all need funding. But most of the time, they don’t get it.
No one is suggesting that Chile is less “deserving” of aid, or that their lives are worth less. That is absurd. But knowing that we each have a limited pool of resources, we all have to make decisions about where and how we give–and right now, Haiti needs more help.
That doesn’t mean people don’t care about Chile. There will soon be a number you can text to donate money there as well (and apparently you are unaware of the fact that it takes time and coordination to establish those numbers, accounts, and projects…and that the Red Cross is the one who takes responsibility for doing so).
Yes, Chilean’s are deserving of our aid. And so are Cambodian and Thai girls sold into the sex trade, and mothers dying in child birth in Africa, and children dying of water born diseases all over the world–and homeless families in Los Angeles, and victims of domestic violence and rape across the US. But you don’t seem too upset about the lack of outpouring for those people in need.
We always need more people giving time, money, and energy to charity. What is truly heartbreaking is that it takes a catastrophe like Haiti or Chile to make me pay any attention.
I think a more interesting take on this story is the difference in “charitable” donations *before* the respective earthquakes, and whether there is any correlation with the loss of life. One of the very *reasons* Haiti was so vulnerable and helpless was their dependence on government and foreign aid, and their utter lack of self-reliance. Compare that to Chile, which is a relatively prosperous, free nation, and you’ll see that self-reliance and independence helped both to minimize vulnerability and speed up recovery from the disaster. (For that matter, you might compare Haiti and the Dominican Republic, two countries which share an island but who experienced two radically different outcomes from their earthquake.)

Jerry Brown has entered the race for California’s governor. Sound familiar? It should; Brown already had this job, 35 years ago.
Yes, the 72-year-old is eligible for social security, but with age comes wisdom. Brown has done much for the Golden State, and given the chance, could do a much better job than current Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has increased California’s spending by $10.2 billion.
There’s no doubt that Brown has significant flaws, especially with regard to his plans for the California prison system. Nevertheless, he remains the most qualified gubernatorial candidate.
Daily Trojan | Victoria Lee
Brown recently served as the mayor of Oakland, where he brought 10,000 new residents to the city and cut the number of serious crimes by more than 30 percent. Currently, he is the attorney general of California, but it seems the gubernatorial job is calling him once more. The next governor will have a lot work cut out for him, and Brown is aware of this.
“Our state is in serious trouble, and the next governor must have the preparation, the knowledge and the know-how to get California working again. That is what I offer, and that’s why I’m declaring my candidacy for governor,” he stated in his press release announcing his candidacy.
It’s true Brown finds a great advantage in his history, especially compared to Republican front-runner Meg Whitman, the former eBay Inc. CEO, who lacks any political experience.
Brown is also a pioneer in the environmental protection corner, and has urged the Obama administration to overturn the Bush-era Environmental Protection Agency’s denial of California’s 30 percent reduction in tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions. Brown even sued Cosco Busan’s owners, operators and pilot after a San Francisco Bay oil spill, on behalf of the California Department of Fish and Game Office of Spill Prevention and Response.
With Brown’s help, in 15 years the state of California will not look like the terrain in Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax.
Brown’s service to the state has also included interest in the education system, mandating that each California high school district establish clear standards for graduation and increasing the prominence of math and science studies in California State University and University of California schools. Recently, Brown has also pressured the UC Office of Presidents to find alternative funding sources for the state school systems that have raised tuition fees by 32 percent. When Pat Brown, Jerry Brown’s father, was governor, he established a solid education system for the state. Hopefully, Jerry can do the same.
Although Brown has an impressive résumé, there is still a problem that is concerning about his campaign: his connection with the prison guards union, which has given large donations to the Brown campaign. Brown also opposed Proposition 5: The Non-Violent Offender Rehabilitation Act, which could have cut state costs by $2.5 billion and reduced prison overcrowding.
Instead of continuing support of the prison guards union, perhaps Brown could garner the interest of higher education groups and spend money on students instead of criminals. If the state could produce more educated people who are productive in the economy, there could be fewer people in prison.
When it is time to vote in November, I can’t say that I will fully support Jerry Brown. Our government has enough old men sitting in office. That being said, I would rather have Brown than the former CEO of eBay Inc. as the governor of California.
John Gudenzi is a junior majoring in English.
I remember when California was run by Jerry Brown, and it was a thriving state who’s educational system was the envy of the nation……yes I remember that. i doubt seriously any of you were alive when Mr. Brown was the governor. The business person as politician model, failed horribly with George Bush, and  I’m an MBA, and career banker. If you want change, change the composition fo the state assembly, Mr. Brown knows what needs to be done. This state used to be #1 in everything, and is now at the bottom of most meaningful measurements. Republican governor AS, who replaced a duly elected governor in a Republican financed coup sponsered by Darrell Issa, a neo con SD politician, has failed miserabley. Another, MBA business type, who accomplished NOTHING as governor……you people need to start paying attention or you’ll get more faliures in the future. The state is in deep trouble. Start with entitlements, out of control immigration, unlawful immigration to boot, unreal educational expectations, crumbling infrastructure, unfriendly business taxation, and small business climate, priorities so out of whack vis a vis sports, entertainment and a host of “soft” issues, that it’ll take years to overturn. The biggest problem facing the state is the upside down state of its “sources and uses”….the people who’ve made all the money and paid all the taxes are leaving the state en masse, and those left pay fewer taxes because they earn less, and many are earning in the “underground economy”. They are collecting from the public instituions while paying little or no taxes.  Mr. Brown is smart and experienced enough to attack these issues and work with the assembly. Ms. Whitman would fail just as Mr. Schwarzenegger has……he cannot work with the democratiic controlled assembly…..wake up people…..there are no more free educations, health care, child care, those days are gone. The state needs to build a business friendly climate with a non-business friendly state assembly…..at least Mr. Brown can work with these people, Ms. Whitman cannot, imo………
To the comments above:
John makes interesting arguments both for AND against Jerry Brown- sure, there is some definite left preference, but Mr. Gudenzi makes sure to address the flaws of his candidacy as well. He even makes some of the same arguments that you have presented in your oppositions- Mr. Gudenzi states: 
“Although Brown has an impressive résumé, there is still a problem that is concerning about his campaign: his connection with the prison guards union, which has given large donations to the Brown campaign.”
“When it is time to vote in November, I can’t say that I will fully support Jerry Brown. Our government has enough old men sitting in office.”
“There’s no doubt that Brown has significant flaws, especially with regard to his plans for the California prison system”
That doesn’t sound like a die-hard Brown supporter to me. Not only does he point out some of Brown’s flaws, but he makes his own suggestion of how Brown’s platform could be improved:
“Instead of continuing support of the prison guards union, perhaps Brown could garner the interest of higher education groups and spend money on students instead of criminals. If the state could produce more educated people who are productive in the economy, there could be fewer people in prison”
Like with any news source, there are inevitable biases. At least this young writer is mature enough to understand that there are positive and negative aspects of both candidates. He couldn’t have made it any more obvious that, in his own mind, he choses what he believes to be the lesser of two evils.  I applaud his effort to take a stance as an intelligent young individual. For those of you that seem to think you are wise beyond his years, if you really want him to listen, it might make more sense to encourage his critical thinking and his writing by simply sharing your knowledge and presenting intellectual points instead of berating his work and character. 
Bravo, young John.
John for a young man you have made some decent arguments but they are reflective of what Jerry Brown is touting as his campaign platform ie experience equals better for California. Well we have had experienced politicians running this state and they have run it to the ground. (the governor does not count since he has a democratic majority in both the house and the senate and as such has been neutered). The excessive spending, excessive entitlements, the overrun prisons have got to end. The state government and the unions are the highest paid in the nation. retirement benefits are outrageous. The environmental efforts you claim as a positive for JB is costing this state jobs  and BTW it is based on research done by a person who claimed to have a PhD was a lie. yet they continue with pushing that legislation with JB’s blessing. Meg Whitman ran a successful business. She knows you cannot spend what you do not have. That is not how a business is run – it would soon be bankrupt just like California. So wake up to reality John . We the people who actually pay for all of the entitlements are fed up of politicians.
Wow, last time I checked Gudenzi was allowed to voice his opinion and not be attacked for it. You may disagree, but that doesn’t give you the right to belittle him nor his choices. This is an opinion piece people, he was stating how he felt and explaining why. Maybe you should all calmly do the same and have a discussion instead jumping all over the man.
Stephanie, we have the same rights as you or anyone else. Humor is a powerful teaching tool, and is covered under the freedom of speech. You have the right to respond with ideas of your own, but you’re not going to convince anyone by telling us what rights we do and don’t have.
Could have used another graph.
and also why the CEO of eBay is unqualified, since your argument is that Brown isn’t the best, but just better than the other candidate.
Great, at a time like this, just what we need is somebody to impose more environmental activist regulation, sue California’s job-creating businesses, and vote for spending increases to fatten the public sector unions. Boy, Mr. Gudenzi, you make a compelling case… I shall certainly vote as you instruct.
John, I have great fear for the future if you are an example of the “critical thinking” skills soon to graduate from USC. Of course, you’re an English major, so you’re not really living in the real world. As such, you are under the vastly mistaken impression that someone with lots of experience in “politics” is to be favored over a successful and smart CEO who has shown she knows how to deal with MONEY.
Christopher is right. Jerry Brown already caused enough damage to California. Wake up, young John.
Jerry Brown has done enough to California. Term limits are a vote of no-confidence for politicians like Jerry Brown.. If Mr. Brown does what his reputation reveals, we will be in worse shape after his election.

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate awarded KSCR, USC’s student-run radio station, a total of  $4,396.50 Tuesday to fund a student trip to a music conference and an upcoming concert hosted by the station.
KSCR requested funds from senate allocations because the radio station was previously denied funding from the USG funding board.
Senators discussed in detail KSCR’s application for funding to send members to attend the South by Southwest Music Festival in Austin, Texas over spring break. The cost is $595 per student to receive what the conference calls a “music badge” and attend networking conferences with music industry officials and artists.
“Badges are expensive for a reason … they wouldn’t be charging that much if it wasn’t worth it,” said Katrina Bouza, a senior majoring in screenwriting and a representative for KSCR. Bouza is also a writer at the Daily Trojan.
The Senate provided funds for a group of students to attend the same conference in New York City last year.
This year, however, some senators were skeptical about sending students again to the same conference.
“It sounds like the same thing … I feel like they can get those resources on campus,” senator Jane Doh said. “They can benefit more by attending those classes instead of paying $600 to attend one conference.”
Still, others saw the value in helping KSCR attend the event.
“Everyone in the industry comes there and it’s like the most insane form of networking possible,” senator Hayden Coplen said.
Senator Juan Orjuela made a motion to amend the request to fund the amount of $2,380, which would buy four music badges instead of KSCR’s request for ten. After buying four badges, the fifth badge is supplied by the conference for free. The senate approved the amendment and voted 8-3 to fund the request.
USG also voted 11-0 to fund $2,061.50 for KSCR Fest 2010, a music concert and arts festival scheduled on March 28, 2010 at USC. A total of six bands will play and the concert is open to all USC students and the community. KSCR representatives said they expect more than 500 people to show up.

Departing Trojan safety Taylor Mays was the talk of the town as the NFL combine came to a close Tuesday with the defensive back workouts.
When Mays, who had already impressed with top-five performances among defensive backs in the bench press (24 reps of 225 pounds) and vertical leap (41 inches), came to the line for his first 40-yard dash of the day expectations were high.
However, when his recorded unofficial time of 4.24 seconds was announced, commentators and scouts were surprised to say the least. Mays’s unofficial time was good enough to tie the fastest 40-yard dash time in the past decade, equaling former East Carolina running back Chris Johnson’s time in 2008.
Mays would step to the line again, this time running the course in an unofficial 4.34 seconds, which was also impressive.
Mays’s official time in the dash, however, was 4.43 seconds (fastest among the day’s attempts) showcasing the stark difference between the terms “official” and “unofficial.”
The combine takes the slower of the two numbers, but even then the contrast between either of Mays’s two runs — although seemingly small — have a great impact on how scouts will view the safety. Mays is still expected to be drafted in the first round of April’s NFL Draft, but an official 4.24 would have blown scouts away and possibly skyrocketed Mays up draft boards around the country.
May’s former teammate cornerback Kevin Thomas ran a 4.48 second dash, good enough for seventh among defensive backs.

Tonight Show takes lead in late night ratings 
Jay Leno has received a warm and successful welcome back to late-night television this week. “It’s good to be home,” he told his audience as he began his first Tonight Show monologue since last year. “I’m Jay Leno, your host. At least, for a while.”
Monday night, his first night back in the 11:30 time slot in almost a year, Leno led the Eastern time slot rating with 6.6 million viewers beating ABC rival Nightline, which had 4.1 million viewers, and CBS’s Late Show with David Letterman, which had 3.8 million viewers, according to the Nielsen Co.
Last night, Jay welcomed Sarah Palin to sit on the couch next to him. To begin the segment Palin, dressed casually in blue jeans and a black trench, poked fun at herself by providing notes for Leno written on her hand. Both Palin and Leno, who have been subject to a great deal of media scrutiny in the past weeks, made light of issues like the media’s treatment of her kids, her speech at the tea party movement and about her campaign with Senator John McCain.
Also appearing on the show last night was Olympic gold medalist Shaun White and a musical performance by controversial pop artist Adam Lambert.
Anderson Cooper to replace Katie Couric? 
Back a few years ago, when there seemed to be a new “Katie Couric is going to leave CBS soon” story every hour, one of the names thought to have been her replacement was CNN’s Anderson Cooper. It seems that those rumors are back, but a little bit more serious this time.
A spokesperson for CNN says that reports that Anderson Cooper is leaving CNN to replace Katie Couric at CBS are not true. Couric’s contract is set to end next year. The New York Times reported on Monday that Cooper met with CBS officials to discuss an anchor job at the network. “Reports that Cooper has recently met with CBS News to talk about the anchor position are false,” the CNN spokesperson said. Cooper is currently a contributing correspondent for CBS’ 60 Minutes show. A CBS spokesperson responded saying, “We’re perfectly happy with the role Anderson currently has at CBS, and we’re not talking to him or anyone else about Katie’s job.”
Media insiders are saying this situation sounds like desperate public relations power play. TheWeek.com is reporting that Cooper’s team planted the rumors because “he’s desperate to get out of his ratings disaster at CNN.”
What’s your take on this situation?
Ochocinco, Anderson, Gosselin among group of new dancers 
ABC released the roster for their new season of Dancing With The Stars. With this line up, I have to say, I think this is going to be one of the best seasons of the show that ABC has ever put together. Although Paula Abdul was not included on the list (amid the rumors of her inclusion for this season), I am pleased because I recognize all the names, unlike in previous seasons. The group is all-inclusive and will appeal to many different American audiences. However, the choices do seem very superficial.
The two biggest names and news makers in my book, ESPN reporter Erin Andrews and football player Chad Ochocinco, will make their debut on the show. Ochocinco, who is a attention-attracting powerhouse, will definitely keep audiences on the tips of their seats with his unpredictable antics. Pamela Anderson and Kate Gosselin, who also made a great deal of news in recent months, are also among the new group of contestants. See the full list below. The new season of DWTS premieres March 22 on ABC.
Pamela Anderson (Baywatch)
Buzz Aldren (retired astronaut)
Shannen Doherty (Beverly Hills 90210)
Kate Gosselin (Jon and Kate Plus 8)

The last time the USC women’s tennis team rallied against its crosstown rival, UCLA, it was competing in its final regular-season dual match.
High performer · Freshman Valeria Pulido captured one of the Women of Troy’s two points in USC’s loss to California last weekend. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
USC posted a 5-2 victory, which secured its Pac-10 championship crown while maintaining an undefeated conference record and a 12-match winning streak heading into the postseason.
Today, No. 12 USC (7-3) will play No. 4 UCLA (11-1) under far different circumstances.
This time around USC is hoping to shake off last Friday’s 5-2 loss to No. 5 California, while UCLA is coming in fresh off an impressive upset victory over the Bears last Sunday during a close match that lasted over five hours.
“A win today would be a big confidence boost for our team,” said junior Maria Sanchez, USC’s No. 3 nationally ranked singles player.
“But in order to beat UCLA, we have to really want it and we have to compete hard,” Sanchez added.
Sanchez was honored with the Pac-10 Player of the Week for last week’s dominating triumphs over Cal’s No. 2 Jana Juricova in a tough three-set match (6-1, 2-6, 6-3), in addition to a smooth 6-2, 6-2 win over San Diego State’s No. 58 Julia Trunk. Sanchez boasts an 8-1 singles record this season.
Sanchez’s singles competition today will be against No. 5 Yasmin Schnack.

“Every match is important to win,” said Danielle Lao, the No. 22 USC freshman. “Our team morale is just as strong as ever, and we’re hungry to go out and compete for something we work so hard for.”

The Olympics might be over, but at USC the quest for gold continues.
USC’s new Green Offices Certification Program has been evaluating campus offices for their environmental consciousness since the fall, certifying the 10th office Tuesday.

Campus offices are assessed and rated based on their commitment to environmentally friendly practices. The program considers factors such as number of recycling bins, use of low-energy computer monitors and use of energy-saving light bulbs. Using a standard set of criteria, the Green Offices Certification Program gives each participating office a certification ranging from bronze to platinum.
Of the 10 offices that have been certified so far, none has achieved better than a silver rating.
“They set goals kind of high, but we can come back and re-evaluate,” said John Baldo, director of university affairs for the Undergraduate Student Government, who has worked closely with sustainability. “They don’t want to just hand out gold to everyone.”
The Office of the Dean at the Viterbi School of Engineering received its certification Tuesday, earning a bronze rating.
Gloria Hayes, a staff member of Viterbi’s Office of the Dean, said the program has shown the office how much they have left to do to be more sustainable.
“The program has done a tremendous amount as far as awareness,” she said. “We have our work cut out for us.”
Hayes said the office worked for months to achieve the bronze certification.
In cases where offices are at risk of not being certified at all, the Sustainability Office will work with the office to help it improve before the certification process is completed, according to Shana Rappaport, a graduate student who works as a liaison for USC Sustainability.
Though the program is still young and no office has reached the gold or platinum level, Rappaport and Sustainability Director Matthew Oden both said they have high hopes for the program’s potential.
“We are essentially building the plane as we fly — no university has developed a program like this,” Rappaport said.
Oden said the program could help advance USC’s standing as an environmentally friendly university.
“USC prides itself on all these things that we’re good at — sports, cinema, etc.,” he said. “The school has a remarkable opportunity to become an environmental leader [too].”
The program is effective, Rappaport said, because it requires offices to take a hard look at their practices and make substantial changes.
“We can talk the green talk, but we have to actualize that commitment by incorporating it into our everyday practices,” she said. “Ninety percent of the actions that are encouraged by the program are things that offices are well in control of.”
Besides the 10 certifications that have been given so far, the Sustainability Office is working with about 80 other offices that are trying to complete the program.
USC created the new Sustainability Office and hired Oden to run the university’s program less than a year ago, and he said that certifying offices is just the beginning.
“I want to empower the community to make those changes,” Oden said. “No single office at USC [alone] can do what we’re trying to do; we need everybody to take part and be creative.”
Oden said there are a few environmental initiatives in the works. One aims to record the university’s greenhouse gas emissions; another hopes to install energy dashboards that display various buildings’ amount of consumption on any given day.
“We want to start to pioneer a path forward for what it looks like for universities in the middle of a megacity,” Oden said. “Hopefully we release a wave of behavioral changes.”
