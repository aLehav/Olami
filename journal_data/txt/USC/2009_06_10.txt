When USC and UCLA face off at the Coliseum on Nov. 28, there will be more than a few storylines to watch.
Objection · Carroll was the only Pac-10 coach to vote no. - Brandon Hui | Summer Trojan
Add one more to the list: UCLA head coach Rick Neuheisel is “ticked off” at USC’s Pete Carroll.
The L.A. Times reported Tuesday that Carroll had voted against having coaches’ children under 18 on the sidelines of Pac-10 games, making him the only voice of dissent in a 9-1 vote.
This apparently upset Neuheisel, who has three sons between the ages of 12 and 17 that are reportedly big Bruin fans. 
According to the Times, he told boosters last month in Westlake Village, Calif., that he was “ticked off” at Carroll as a result. In the video — available for viewing on the UCLA YouTube channel — Neuheisel added that he hoped: “We’re gonna walk out of this room tonight, ladies and gentlemen, ticked off at Pete Carroll, ticked off at all that is ‘SC, and we’re gonna get after their ass, alright?”
This may simply be a case of what’s best for each of the coaches, as Carroll’s kids — USC assistant coach Brennan, 27-year-old former Women of Troy volleyball player Jaime, and current USC undergraduate Nathan — are all over the age of 18.

USC has elected to renew its football series with Hawaii, scheduling a pair of games for the 2012 and 2013 season last week. 
The Warriors will come to the Coliseum on Sept. 1, 2012, to open the season and will host USC on Aug. 31, 2013. 
USC also announced it will move the date of its 2010 matchup with Hawaii in Honolulu to Sept. 2 from Sept. 4. The Thursday kickoff at 5:30 p.m. Hawaiian time will allow the game to be broadcast nationally by ESPN. 
“We’re excited to be able to add some more games against Hawaii to our schedule,” said USC coach Pete Carroll in a press release. “I know our players and fans enjoy traveling to Honolulu for the game, and we get good crowd support from the many Trojan fans living in Hawaii who get to see us play. And it works out well for Hawaii coming to the Coliseum, because they have such a strong fan base in Southern California.”
Playing an away game at Hawaii will allow the Trojans to take advantage of an NCAA rule allowing a 13th game for any team traveling to the island. USC is currently slated to play four out-of-conference teams in 2010 — Hawaii, Virginia, Minnesota and Notre Dame — in addition to the nine mandatory Pac-10 games.
USC only has three out-of-conference games scheduled for 2013 — at Hawaii, vs. Boston College and at Notre Dame — but the athletic department plans on scheduling a fourth, according to a post by Ben Malcolmson on USCripsit.com. 
The Trojans are 6-0 all-time against the Warriors. USC rode to a 63-17 season-opening win in Honolulu in 2005, the last time the two teams met.

A national splash · Women of Troy’s Kami Craig, above, and J,W, Krumpholz of the men’s team, not pictured, took home the Cutino honor. - Katelynn Whitaker | Summer Trojan 
USC water polo players Kami Craig and J.W. Krumpholz were named the 2009 recipients of the Cutino Award at a banquet held Saturday in San Francisco. The Cutino Award is given each year to the nation’s best collegiate water polo players, men’s and women’s, as voted on by Division I coaches.
Craig, a redshirt junior two-meter last season, helped lead the Women of Troy to a 26-2 record, a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference championship and an appearance in the NCAA national championship game. She scored 40 goals on the season and was named MPSF Player of the Year. 
Craig took a redshirt during the 2008 season to compete with the United States national team in the Olympics, winning a silver medal in Beijing. She scored 38 goals in each of her first two seasons at USC and was named an All-American both years. 
Krumpholz, a junior two-meter, was the leading scorer with 43 goals on USC’s 2008 undefeated national champion men’s squad. He scored in 24 of the Trojans’ 29 games, helping bring home a MPSF title, the national championship and the program’s first undefeated season since 1944.
The trophy chest is already full for Krumpholz as he took home Co-MPSF Player of the Year honors, the 2008 National Player of the Year award and was named the MVP of both the MPSF and NCAA tournaments. He, too, joined the U.S. national team in Beijing last summer and won a silver medal. 
Krumpholz has 101 career goals and has been named an All-American in each of his three years as a Trojan. 
Stanford’s Jimmie Sandman and UCLA’s Krsto Sbuega were the other male finalists for the Cutino Award. The women’s finalists were UCLA’s Tanya Gandy and USC’s Michelle Stein, who led the Women of Troy with 75 goals last season. 
Craig and Krumpholz became USC’s sixth and seventh recipients of the prestigious award. The sweep of both the men’s and women’s awards was the second in program history after Juraj Zatovic and Lauren Wenger took home the hardware in 2006.

Back for first · One of 16 males to compete for the Trojans, Corey White will throw the javelin, where he finished runner-up last season. - Brandon Hui | Summer Trojan 
All of the USC track team’s efforts have certainly paid off, earning members a long list of accomplishments in the last few months — but their  hard work is not yet over. The NCAA Championships begin Wednesday in Fayetteville, Ark., and the team has a long road ahead of them.
This week has been met with some success already as the track tream is getting ready for the biggest meet of the year. Ron Allice, director of track and field for USC, was named the West Regional Men’s Head Coach of the Year by the U.S. Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association Monday, which happened just days after Allice helped take the team to the fourth West Regional win in the last five years. 
Beginning their journey early Sunday morning (and experiencing a few minor luggage setbacks), they departed from the Los Angeles International Airport and reached their Arkansas destination later that evening. After a night of rest and relaxation, the Trojans began to practice Monday afternoon in an effort to fine-tune technique and get their minds prepared.
With 13 female and 16 male individual athletes and four relay teams ready to compete, USC enters the championships with a large variety of talent in many different areas of the sport, and since the only way to qualify for this competition was to place in the top five of the regional (top three in the relays), the team has proved its grit.
Allice explained earlier this season that the team was not planning on focusing on any particular area of its technique prior to the meet, but just maintaining focus on the skills it has already accumulated throughout the season.
Both the men and women’s teams have used those skills to land themselves a No. 7 ranking, according to the final USTFCCCA scores, and they’re hoping to shoot up the ranks this week. USC just outran the No. 2 team, Oregon, in the West Regional, a feat that has them optimistic about this week’s final meet. 
The top 10 teams for men going into this meet are: Texas A&M, Oregon, Florida, Arkansas, LMU, South Carolina, USC, Stanford, Nebraska and Arizona State; while the women’s top then are: Texas A&M, Oregon, LSU, Arizona State, Tennessee, Florida State, USC, Penn State, Baylor, and Texas.
CBS will be televising the last day of the championship (June 13) from 10 a.m. to noon and will air the next-to-last day events on the 12th on CBS College Sports beginning at 4 p.m.

Prior to a month ago, the last time the USC men’s tennis team won a national championship was May 21, 2002. They were coached by Dick Leach, who retired after securing the program’s 16th title. Ten days later, Peter Smith was announced head coach.
First at last · USC men’s tennis coach Peter Smith hoists the NCAA team championship trophy, USC’s 17th but Smith’s first. Coaching since he was 23, Smith had stints at three schools before he came to USC. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information
That was the beginning of Smith’s career with the Trojans. In the seven seasons that he has been head coach, he has sent the Trojans to the NCAA Tournament six times. Most notably, Smith led the 2009 men’s tennis team to a national title — the program’s 17th and Smith’s first.
Smith’s career as a head coach, however, did not begin with USC. It began at Long Beach State where Smith played tennis for three years before trying his hand as a professional. 
He participated in prestigious tournaments such as the U.S. Open and Wimbledon during his 15-month stint as a professional player. He then returned to Long Beach to finish his undergraduate degree and coach the 49ers men’s tennis team that he had been a member of less that two years prior. 
At the age of 23, Smith became the youngest Division I head coach in history.
“It was a unique situation and it was a blast; half the team were my [former] teammates,” Smith said.  “Fortunately I had a good reputation so it wasn’t too hard but we were a gang is what we were and I was the leader. That will never happen again.” 
Smith said that being an undergrad, he was taking the same classes as some of the players he was coaching. 
After his four years coaching at Long Beach State, Smith moved on to Fresno State where he took an ailing program and turned it into one of the best in the nation. Smith led the Bulldogs to their first-ever Western Athletic Conference championship in 1996 as well as their first-ever NCAA Tournament appearance in 1994. He also coached the program’s first All-American.
At that point Smith began to gain national recognition for his talents as a head coach. His next move was to Pepperdine University, his last stop before USC. At Pepperdine, Smith coached eight All-Americans and led the Waves to a West Coast Conference championship each of his five years as head coach.
 When Smith received the job at USC he had two incoming freshman recruits, Scott Doerner and Kevin Borzenski, who opted to stay at Pepperdine. Four years later, as seniors in 2006, Borzenski and Doerner won the national championship as Waves.
Smith was elated for his former recruits who he never had the chance to coach. 
“I loved those players and it’s kind of funny because Scott just sent me an e-mail congratulating me,” Smith said. “Those were two great, great kids and in the end it’s character that matters. It’s the character that’s going to come through and achieve the greatness. I was rooting for them the whole way.”
In three years Smith would learn what it felt like to coach a team to national championship success, but the road was far from smooth. 
In 2008, Smith coached Robert Farah and former Trojan Kaes Van’t Hof to a doubles championship. Van’t Hof had been the only senior that year so it seemed the roster would still be in tact for the following season, but that was not the case.
Somewhere between the 2008 and 2009 seasons, five players left the team, Van’t Hof being the only graduate.  That left Smith with only five returning players — Farah, Abdullah Magdas, Jaak Põldma, Jason McNaughton and Daniel Gliner. 
“I’ve taken criticism from people outside the program asking me what’s wrong with the program,” Smith said.
With the help of his five returning players and five talented freshmen joining the roster in Steve Johnson, Matt Kecki, Daniel Nguyen, Andrew Kells and Ben Lankenau, Smith proved there was absolutely nothing wrong after all.
 The freshmen talent ran deep, deep enough to fill three of the six spots in the lineup and contribute to a national championship.
“I loved the potential that we had. We had three freshmen in the lineup and each of those freshman also played doubles. That’s amazing,” Smith said. “In January I never thought we could have won, but when I saw the draw I said: ‘That’s the draw for us to win.’” 
Smith has coached talented teams before, but this young team — with only one senior [Magdas] — was his first to win a championship. 
“This team had a really unique combination of talent, depth of character and a real determination to win,” Smith said. “They all were kind of on the same page.”
At the end of the day it may be his ability to relate to his players that sets Smith apart from other coaches. 
“I hope they can see that I care a little bit more and that I’m just with them,” he said.
Smith has found that coaching satisfies his desire to help people, his competitive drive and his ability to problem solve. 
“Being at USC you have a ton of pressure on yourself to succeed. It’s always kept me on my toes and always got me out of bed,” Smith said. 
Today Smith still participates in tennis tournaments and is looking forward to getting the Trojans another national championship next year. 
“USC is the team to beat, absolutely the team to beat and we’ve worked hard for that,” Smith said. “In the end the best team always wins, and we proved that we are the best team.”

Moon unit · “Moon” follows astronaut Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) and his lonely plight in outer space. A British independent production, “Moon” is directed by Duncan Jones, who is the son of legendary musician David Bowie. The film also stars Academy Award-winner Kevin Spacey. - Photos Courtesy of Liberty Films 
Imagine waking up with bright lights above you and a terrible headache. A robot greets you as your heavy eyelids flutter open, and that robot’s steady voice sounds an awful lot like Kevin Spacey.
This recurring experience is a common motif in “Moon,” a British independent film starring both the voice talents of Spacey as Gerty the robot and Sam Rockwell as lonely astronaut Sam Bell. 
Director Duncan Jones, David Bowie’s first son, puts a steady focus on Rockwell’s character, crafting a story that is part “Castaway,” part “Blade Runner” and a whole lot of philosophy. Bell, the sole groundskeeper for moon station Sarang, has an important job: to make sure his station takes care of the harvesters gathering the precious H3 on the dark side of the moon in order to fuel Earth’s practical needs. 
 His private contract lasts three years, and his only companion is a painfully polite robot attached to the ceiling who emotes using a screen with an animated smiley face on it. To pass the time, he whittles a tiny model of Fairfield, Conn. out of wood, runs on the treadmill and tapes messages to his wife and daughter. 
 Even in all of its proximity, the moon’s broken satellite has barred live communications between Sarang and a forlorn Bell who yearns for human contact. 
 Two weeks before Bell’s return to Earth, however, unnerving things begin to occur. His head starts to throb, he begins to hallucinate and he gets into a terrible moon rover accident. When he comes to, a younger version of himself is there, determined to figure out why there are two of them. 
“Moon,” from the general synopsis, may seem a bit thriller in its genre, but in reality it’s more of a thoughtful exploration of the meaning of identity. Jones’s ambitious effort to combine science fiction with relatable themes of humanity, identity and memory are a far cry from the special-effects whirlwinds that many studios offer to fill the sci-fi void. 
Audience members won’t be able to root for a light saber-toting Bell that valiantly stabs the heart of green space beasts to save the pretty princess. He instead bleeds, limps and questions himself in an isolated space box that does not glamorize the industrial nature of his purpose there. “Moon” does a surprisingly stellar job of making a highly personal, quiet sci-fi film that does not drag on in details nor cover up plot holes with silly noises and lights. Sure, there are logistical science questions, but those are forgivable — “Moon” isn’t about the moon, but the man who has chosen to live there. 
The moon turns from the first human connection to a mysterious and awesome space into a desolate island in which men lose and doubt themselves for the sake of the rest of humanity. It is a necessary mine, an airless Siberia with static white walls that recall dirty, utilitarian versions of the cars in Disneyland’s Space Tours ride. 
 Rockwell’s performance, however, does not echo the minimalism of his quarters. Rather, his interpretation of the two Rockwells, one tortured and decaying, the other hot-tempered and determined, hints at an actor that has the power to make viewers uneasy in a good way, questioning their own inner paradoxes and conflicts. 
Rockwell is essentially the sole character, the embodiment of the entire plot throughout the movie,  and his presence is at once captivating and holds a high level of interest, despite the sometimes abstract and subtle nature of “Moon.” 
Even though the climatic plot twist might surprise those same viewers, it also offers an unfortunately predictable resolution that turns what could have been a thoroughly different film into an indie “WALL-E” without the adorable “Hello, Dolly!” soundtrack. 
The cliché bad guy here, of course, is Lunar Industries, a global corporation that will stop at nothing to continue a profit, even if it means streamlining human life — if you consider a clone a human. 
Duncan’s choices to make “Moon” so visually drab — swatches of gray, muted colors and a space station that looks like it has actually seen some work — drives his ecologically minded, anti-corporate, identity-searching point into the ground using a setting loftier than the imagination. The moon isn’t a thing of wonder and beauty, possibility and hope, but a place of self-discovery, even that of a sinister nature. 
The moon, after all, was the first and only space body that humans actually touched. A decade into the next century, astronauts still have not walked on other celestial bodies. 
“Moon” seeks not to question the science, but instead, the psychology of that — and though it tries its very best, the film only makes it to orbit. There’s no transcendental, intergalaxy rush at the end, but only the lonely, lovely whoosh of ships that have been there before.

Creepy crawlers · “Monsters & Beasts: Hairy, Scary and Unleashed” is the latest exhibit at the Muzeo Museum in Anaheim, Calif. The exhilerating new exhibit showcases animatronic creatures. - Photo Courtesy of Muzeo Museum 
The room is dimly lit in hues of red and blue. Quiet, menacing music plays in the background.
Suddenly, a slow roar comes from across the large room, making me jump out of fright.
 I slowly turn to look for the source of the disconcerting sound, soon realizing it’s only one of the interactive displays in the exhibit. 
“The Monsters & Beasts: Hairy, Scary and Unleashed” exhibit at Anaheim’s Muzeo Museum is not just informative about what it takes to make a movie monster — it puts you right in the heart of it. 
When I first arrived at Muzeo, I was unsure what to expect. I was immediately greeted by a towering amphibious monster, setting the tone for the rest of the visit. Monsters & Beasts is designed to keep you on your toes — and be ready to run. 
While not all of the beasts are terrifying — Gorilla from “George of the Jungle” was actually quite cute — they all took immense effort to create. Academy Award -winning visual effects artist John Cox donated the animatronic monsters from his Creature Workshop. 
Visitors to the museum get behind-the-scenes looks at creatures through every stage of production. There are several actual storyboards where you can see Cox’s handwritten notes. After the storyboards come the maquettes, which are small, to scale models of the monsters. Then you see the broken down steps to create the full-size versions. 
The range is of the detail is great, showing everything from how every single hair on all of the gorillas in “George of the Jungle” was individually sewn into the suits to  how the chords and wires for the animatronic Inspector Gadget are hidden within the pole of the stop sign he runs into. 
But the best part? All the interactive portions. They bring  out one’s youthful sense of curiosity, not to mention the opportunity to push the big red button and see what happens. 
In the span of an hour, I filmed myself controlling the three meter-long crocodile from “Peter Pan,” touched alien organs and mastered Junior the Dinosaur from “Gargantua.” The only downside? Junior, nicknamed “Rex” by the museum’s director of marketing Karen Gee, somehow acts up and roars, all on his own. 
Talk about unnerving. But I guess that’s all just part of the magic of this exhibit.

Battle in the classroom · “Oleanna,” which is penned by David Mamet, explores the dynamic relationship between a pretentious college professor and his independent-thinking student. The play discusses several pertinent issues, including sexual harrassment. - Photo Courtesy of Center Theatre Group 
As college students, we’ve all been here before — sitting in class for a semester and listening (or in many cases, simply watching) a smug professor lecture incessantly. You’re hearing words, taking notes and doing the reading, like every student should.
But here’s the catch — he or she then promptly tells you that everything you and your classmates have done is just deliberate torture. A hazing of sorts — a “fashionable necessity.”
Add in a failing grade and the acute affliction of not being able to understand a professor’s concepts and that is the starting point of director Doug Hughes’ latest theatrical production, “Oleanna.”
Written by esteemed playwright David Mamet, “Oleanna” is the tense story between professor John (Bill Pullman) and student Carol (Julia Stiles). 
One cannot help but reason that these two actors known almost immediately  for their forays into cult comedy films (“Spaceballs” and “10 Things I Hate About You,” respectively) have embarked on this project to claim spots in the realm of serious theater. 
The two actor’s performances are just as divergent as the ideologies of the two sole characters in the play. The clashing personalities represent two degrees of entitlement; a professor that feels  he deserves tenure because of his hard work and irreverent thought in order for him to provide for his wife and son; and a student who contends that she deserves a thorough education because she has overcome prejudice to earn the right to learn.
Of course, any student would immediately plunge into feelings of anger at the said professor, one who receives the splendors of his or her ritualized and socialized need to get a degree and pay thousands upon thousands of dollars to only hear their beliefs belittled and mocked. Stiles’ treatment of the character, which should be relatable to the college student, instead alienates.

Carol, through Mamet’s writing, vaguely references a “group” that supports her reports at her professor’s sexual harassment and inappropriate teaching style that eventually prevents him from losing his recommendation for tenure. 
Stiles brings a glowering sense of infuriating neediness to Carol that makes the character a villain rather than a relatable representation of a generation of young women torn between what is expected of them from and what they truly want to do with their lives. 
Stiles stutters through overcalculated and overrehearsed lines.  This is possibly a fault in Mamet’s writing, which is known for its  awkward wording and unbelievable dialogue, however, it is hard to believe that Carol’s hardened shell of a college student could ever be a real person. Her slouching shoulders and stilted pacing just does not demand any sort of empathy or believability.
Though the script’s lack of contractions and dense semantics take some of the blame, Stiles’ Carol falls short of a living, breathing human being, which completely invalidates some of the power she is supposed to yield over Pullman’s sniveling John.
Pullman’s stilted, posturing awkwardness, however, is a portrait of the quintessential egotistical professor who uses personal stories to validate his sense of self. He is flustered and exasperated, gesticulating as if he is motioning to distract from his blundering nature.
He is subject to the calls of his students, of tenure committees and the constant calls he receives from his wife and his realtor. John’s dream of home ownership vaporizes as soon as Carol files a complaint of sexual harassment, and, because he feels he is cornered, he physically acts out against Carol.
The play, which has no intermission in its 75 minutes, is a series of interruptions — some of which are violent — between two vastly disparate characters in an academic and societal context. Their stories of the same series of events and interactions starkly differ, and it is up to the audience to choose which side with which it wants to identify.
Other issues are here too, such as the false weight of academia, the pressures of consumerism and class and the lack of constructive communication between two people. Its flaw in this construct, however, is the emphasis put on the genders of the characters. Rather than making a statement on the difference between two clearly different people, there is an uncomfortably simplified blame on their genders. 
This may not be Mamet’s intent, but Hughes’ directing and the performances of Pullman and Stiles make it so — and it isn’t just because Carol accuses John of rape. 
“Oleanna” may arise from conflict, but in this case the conflict overwhelms so much that the plot’s message falls apart and becomes almost indecipherable among the interruptions of dialogue and the numerous heavy, blaring rings of a cell phone.

The very nature of “Oleanna” is to question ideals, much like John’s stated intent when he teaches. Instead, it is a carefully rehearsed set of disagreements, yelling and meticulously placed references to societal wrongs that may provoke members of the audience to question the structure of the ideals put on higher education as well as the terms of relationships between people — needless to say, the whole production overwhelms.
The cryptic, one-word title has no direct tie to any of the words in the script or the unnamed setting of the play; the work’s three meetings between the two protagonists are punctuated by the loud, bizarre opening and closing of metal blinds and John and Carol’s unfinished sentences just feel too edgy and too placed to make “Oleanna” a human story. Though the play’s title takes itself from a folk song’s name for utopia, it’s not a clear enough reference to completely make sense.
Instead, “Oleanna” reads as a foray into two versions of privilege — a pretentious, blurry portrait of societal roles littered with abruptness, whose pair of strangely placed stars are forced into the unfair burden of criticizing a society using material that is too deliberate and tries far too hard.

Matteo Marjoram | Summer Trojan
Few panties get in a bunch over issues like constitutional interpretation, except in that rare case when a U.S. president nominates someone to the Supreme Court. Incidentally, this nominee actually wears panties (presumably), and in the forthcoming weeks, hers might actually get in a big, messy bunch.
Neither as visceral an issue as abortion nor as relevant as immigration, constitutional interpretation is nonetheless more important than either — it has the final say on both these issues, after all — but few even know which side they are on. And small wonder if we look at the sides, which are far less clear-cut than we might expect, and far more esoteric. 
Some call their philosophy on constitutional interpretation “originalism” — that the constitution has a set meaning, decided by our forefathers at the time of its inception; others say they believe in “activism,” and that the constitution is a living, changing document. And there are plenty more “isms” where those came from. 
The problem is, us layfolk rarely bother with philosophical isms, especially of the jurisprudential kind, mostly because we don’t know what they mean. The man who runs the local bakery might believe we should interpret the U.S. Constitution based on the original intent of the framers, but he would never say — barring an unlikely background in either philosophy or law — that he subscribes to the tenets of judicial originalism, unless he wants to scare away paying customers. 
However, perhaps now, in light of Sonia Sotomayor’s nomination to the Supreme Court, we should start to think more meaningfully about where we stand. How should our nation’s founding document be interpreted? It is a question that Supreme Court justices spend their entire professional lives trying to answer. Few could give an answer. 
Over the next several weeks, we will hear a few more isms than we might be used to, and it is our responsibility to judge for ourselves if Sotomayor’s personal ism is the right one. 
During her confirmation hearings, Sotomayor’s judicial philosophy will be dissected with every political implement the Senate has, cast under a microscope, picked at and prodded, and finally left exposed for all to see. It will be a tedious process, but one which should reignite in the national consciousness this noble and age-old debate. 
No one can say what Sotomayor’s philosophy will look like. Some accuse her of judicial activism, or legislating from the bench. Such a philosophy was perhaps best articulated by former Justice William Brennan, who said: “The ultimate question must be, what do the words of the text mean in our time?” His is a living constitution. 
This idea seems, on some level, very wrong, for it disregards entirely the intent of the framers, who strove to create a constitution for all times, not just their own. Moreover, how can we say the Constitution is explicit in one area — say, in the age requirement for the president — but interpretable in others?
On the other hand, there is originalism, a “jurisprudence of original intent,” wrote former Attorney General Edwin Meese. Here, the Constitution is viewed as inseparable from its original meaning. Not only does this prevent extreme cases of judicial activism, but it may also be a way of ensuring a more objective interpretation. 
Still, this philosophy isn’t perfect either. Some profess to know much about the genesis of the Constitution, but the truth is, we don’t, or rather, couldn’t. How, for example, could we ever know what the framers would have thought about stem cell research?
Perhaps there is a middle ground. Justices in general should defer to authorial intention when they can — when the law is clearly enumerated — but should not be slaves to the text’s original meaning. Sotomayor’s richness of experience should, in part, inform her jurisprudence — but inform, not define. 
In accepting her nomination, Sotomayor said: “For as long as I can remember, I have been inspired by the achievement of our Founding Fathers. They set forth principles that have endured for more than two centuries. Those principles are as meaningful and relevant in each generation as the generation before. It would be a profound privilege for me to play a role in applying those principles to the questions and controversies we face today.” 
That sounds about right — and I don’t think we have an ism for that just yet.

It is easy for most of us, as privileged and well-educated members of the strange and mysterious city called Los Angeles, to lose perspective on the harsh realities of the standard of living held by much of the city’s population.  The disparity of classes and the wide, uneven dispersion of wealth in Los Angeles is incredible, yet while many of its financially stable inhabitants are at least subconsciously aware of the intermingling cultures in our city, we rarely devote any considerable amount of time to thinking about the implications of this great divide. 
We are so encompassed in our own lives that we are hesitant — or unable — to extend much concern to anyone else.  Los Angeles is, after all, the city of “me,” and our self-absorption ensnares us in a limited trap of selfishness.  We worry and whine about the small hardships we face on a daily basis without pausing to realize that our troubles are rarely severe enough to warrant such stress.  Let’s face it: even as college students, we are significantly better off than a large portion of Los Angeles’ population.
I had a bit of a revelatory cultural wake-up call at the beginning of the summer, when in a single day I happened to experience both extremes of the Los Angeles economic spectrum for extended periods of time.  I had to attend traffic school in the morning, and I went to a school located in a small, run-down cement building located in South L.A., where my fellow classmates shared horror stories about being attacked on the public bus system and of juggling multiple jobs to care for their families. 
After our requisite eight hours of watching bad instructional driving videos from the 1990s, I had to drive north to my job at an upscale restaurant located in the sparkling new L.A. Live complex next to the Staples Center.  There, I encountered an entirely different culture: The restaurant was teeming with groups of successful businessmen, clusters of diamond-clad women and throngs of individuals who had just attended the Lakers game or the American Idol taping. 
It was a sobering day for me.  The realities of the extent of the pain endured by the individuals I had met that morning struck me deeply, forcing me to re-examine how I view our own so-called hardships.  It is easy to think that the world of the wealthy Angelinos, the one that permeates the city’s projected image and skews our perception of what it means to live a good life, is normal when it is all we ever see.  But many of the problems we fret over are really quite trivial compared to the obstacles that our neighbors have to overcome every day. 
It should be a requirement at USC for students to actually spend time with the people who live in the dreaded area of Los Angeles just south of us commonly called “the ghetto.”  Racial stereotypes and class generalizations often permeate our conversation of the neighborhood that surrounds us.  Yes, this area is poor and sometimes crime-ridden.  However, people cannot control the circumstances they are born into. Almost two out of five Los Angeles County residents do not have enough income to meet their basic needs, and an estimated 15.4 percent of Los Angeles County residents live below the federal poverty threshold.
There is a great disparity in the quality of life among Los Angeles residents, but there is also a great opportunity for the revision of the student mind set of our surroundings. Let’s prove wrong our oft-used “spoiled” acronym and extend our vision of the city we inhabit beyond the bubbles of our own selves.

Brand new · Members of PhiDelt will use the fraternity’s new house this fall for various events. This fall marks the first semester since 2002 that the fraternity has had a house on The Row. - Dieuwertje Kast | Summer Trojan 
The Phi Delta Theta fraternity celebrated its return to The Row Thursday as members and alumni got a first glance at the newly renovated, $4-million house that will be home to almost half of PhiDelt’s active members in the fall.
PhiDelt has been missing from The Row since 2002, when the fraternity was suspended by the university for behavioral issues. In 2005, three alumni petitioned the school to allow the chapter to return, but in the April of that year, as they were planning renovations to the house that was soon to be inhabited again, the building caught fire, calling for far more extensive repairs than had originally been envisioned.
Now, five years and $4 million later, PhiDelt is ready to take back its place on The Row.
“It’s been a long time coming now,” said Michael Spilsbury, who was president of PhiDelt last year. “You can sense it among the chapter how excited people are to finally have house on The Row and finally get to live together.”
The renovations and reconstruction was managed by PhiDelt’s housing corporation, a group of alumni who dealt with securing funds and meeting with the construction company.
Ali Shorooghi, who became a part of PhiDelt when the fraternity returned to USC in 2005 and was involved in the reconstruction as a member of the housing corporation, said the fraternity used a loan from USC as well as an additional private loan to fund the construction. To raise money to pay back the loans, the housing corporation hired the Laurus Group, which specializes in capital campaigns for fraternities and sororities. With the help of the Laurus Group, PhiDelt was able to secure donations from more than 75 people, totaling $1.8 million.
The construction did hit some roadblocks, as the property — which once belonged to the Spanish consulate — is considered an historical property, and as such, renovations had to be approved by the city and other historical groups.
“The windows were a huge issue,” Shorooghi said. “We were putting in these nice, huge windows and they said: ‘No, they need to be like they were in the 1800s.’”
In addition to windows that look like they’re from the 1800s, the house has music practice rooms, 17 double bedrooms, a full kitchen and a large backyard.
Spilsbury described the nearly 100 members and alumni who saw the house at the June 4 opening as “awestruck.”

“I think it looks quite a bit different than when they used to live there,” Spilsbury said of the alumni. “They were just really, really excited.”
The current members are also excited, both for the house’s amenities and to simply have their place back on The Row.
“We’re really excited about it,” said Josh Friedman, public relations director of PhiDelt. “We’ve been able to do a whole lot without a house and this is just going to amplify our efforts and our activities.”
Spilsbury said he is equally excited about the house, which will house approximately half of the fraternity’s current members.
“It’s going to be really, really special for all of us,” Spilsbury said. “It’s been somewhat difficult without a house. It’s going to be a place where everyone can come and be proud and say: ‘This is the PhiDelt house.’ I know everyone’s going to be really, really excited to move in and I think it’ll make this fraternity experience more complete for all of us.”
Friedman said the fraternity has no definite plans for the fall semester, as members intend to spend time getting used to life on The Row, but said members hope to host a large philanthropy concert in the fall.
“We’re just kind of getting into it,” Friedman said. “None of us have ever experienced ever having a frat house so we’re just really easing into it going to see how it goes.”
In the meantime, PhiDelt will welcome visitors to its newly restored residence.
“We really encourage people to come by and to take a look at the house,” Friedman said.

For months, the Information Technology Services department has been advertising the coming of the “new Blackboard.”  While many students have seen this new addition advertised on their Blackboard home pages, many have probably not explored the full range of what this means after the switch takes place this summer.
As Blackboard is upgrades from Version 7.3 to Version 9, the overall look of the website will be overhauled, replacing the blue and gray color scheme with USC’s traditional cardinal and gold. More substantially speaking, Blackboard is making a number of logistical changes that is designed to make it a more useful and productive tool for teachers and students.
Professors will no longer have to access a separate control panel to make changes to their class page. All options for uploading files, creating assignments and posting links will be available to them on this new course page.
Furthermore, any updates posted by instructors will be transmitted to the students more efficiently in the new version. On each course home page there will be modules such as “My Announcements,” “What’s New” and “To Do.” Each page will provide students with information that has changed since the student last visited, and all students and teachers will receive a nightly e-mail if anything has been changed or updated in the course.
The “to do” feature of the course home page will allow students to include paper dates or test reminders to help them stay organized.
 When turning in assignments on Blackboard, the new system will no longer use the drop-box design of the current version. With Blackboard 9, the new assignment tool allows instructors to create a separate box for each assignment. In addition, Blackboard will automatically rename each student’s file to include the assignment name, student’s username and the filename of the original submittal.
While the grade book, now termed the grade center, is commonly used by students to check their grades, the changes that have been made in Version 9 are primarily for instructors.
In the grade center, input of student grades will be similar to entering data in Microsoft Excel and will go directly into the grade center spreadsheet. Blackboard will keep a grade history where it will show the new grade, old grades, when the grade was changed, and who changed it, and instructors will also be able to create and print grade reports. 
Some students said they did not believe the upgrade to Blackboard would directly affect their use of the website.
“It seems like the changes were made for the teachers. But I guess that will probably mean better Blackboard class pages for us,” said Buck Elkins, a junior majoring in civil engineering.
While new features are included in Blackboard 9, there will also be a few items missing. While students will be able to send e-mails to their class, the “send e-mail” link in the tools section will no longer be available. To increase communication between the student and the class, the website also features blogging and journal sections.
Many students said they would welcome the changes, and said the website was in need of improvements.	
“Blackboard has been needing to be updated. Its format looks old and I hardly use it for anything other than checking my grades,” said Samantha Klein, junior majoring in fine arts.

More details have emerged about the three men who robbed multiple students inside the Alpha Tau Omega house Friday night, Department of Public Safety officials said. The robbery is one of four in the past week.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said three black males entered ATO around 9:20 p.m., told those in the house they had a weapon — though no weapon was seen — and demanded property.
“Three suspects entered, indicating they were looking for someone, but the victims didn’t know who it was,” Carlisle said. “Then [the suspects] said they had a weapon and demanded their property.”
The victims complied, handing over wallets and money. Though there were three people in the ATO house at the time of the robbery, it is unclear whether or not they all lost property, Carlisle said.
In addition to wallets, Carlisle said the suspects also took electronic equipment, including a flat panel monitor and a television, and then fled to a vehicle in a nearby alley.
Carlisle said that, though the suspects claimed to have at least one weapon, and might have simulated one, no weapon was actually seen by the victims.
“Whether a gun was seen or not, it concerns us greatly,” Carlisle said. “Any robbery is a very serious matter.” 
Though the robbery occurred inside the ATO house, Carlisle said the victims were not members of the fraternity, as the house is leased out during the summer.
“We don’t think it was the fraternity that was actually targeted,” Carlisle said.
It is not clear how the suspects entered the house, but Carlisle said, at this point, DPS believes the door was unlocked.
Though sorority houses on The Row are often staffed by security guards — who could have seen the suspects enter ATO — Carlisle said few houses employ security guards during the summer. The ATO house is also not equipped with security cameras, as some houses on The Row are.
The ATO robbery was the third in four days in the USC area, and was followed by a fourth on June 7, though Carlisle said ATO appears to be an unrelated incident.
DPS reported two robberies early last week — one on Ellendale Street at 9:30 p.m. on June 2, the other on the W. 27th Street at 9:44 a.m. on June 3 — but said neither appears to be connected to the robbery at ATO. In both of the earlier incidents, only was suspect was involved and a weapon was displayed.
DPS also reported a robbery on June 7, two days after the ATO robbery, in which a victim sitting on his front porch on 27th Street was approached by a suspect displaying part of gun. The suspect followed the victim into his apartment and removed his property.
No arrests have been made in any of these robberies, Carlisle said.
