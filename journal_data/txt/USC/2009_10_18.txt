It is not often that you see a cello ensemble — much less ones with a drug-referencing acronym — but the Portland Cello Project is determined to destroy that notion. With an extremely talented and composed group of professional cellists, they are out to prove that classical and popular music are more directly related than we might have thought.
Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan Take a bow · The Portland Cello Project, a unique ensemble that frequently employs a rotation of classical Portland-based musicians, performs at the intimate venue the Echo Friday. The group opened for indie rock band Thao and The Get Down Stay Down, collaboraters on PCP’s latest album. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
“Our goal is to tour the nation’s bars and not get things thrown at us,” said one Portland Cello Project member at the beginning of Friday’s show at the Echo.
PCP is out on tour promoting its newest album, The Thao and Justin Power Sessions.
Headlining the tour are friends Thao with The Get Down Stay Down — an outlet for the music of Thao Nguyen, an explosive and extremely talented indie musician.
But Friday night’s lineup at the Echo is not the first time we have seen indie-rock music intertwine with its classical roots. Over the years, many artists in many genres have combined these two styles in interesting ways. Recently, acts like M-83 and Beck performed with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at traditionally classical venues, like the Walt Disney Concert Hall or the Hollywood Bowl.
In the beginning of its performance, PCP had technical problems that left a large segment of the crowd uninterested. One of the Cellos had very low signal, and just resonated when the low notes sounded — creating an annoying echo that overpowered the other three instruments.
The ensemble figured out its difficulties, however, and continued with the show. The remaining crowd was attentive to every note of this somber and virtuous ensemble while the back of the room appeared completely uninterested, submerged in the bar and talking loudly enough to disturb those who wanted to listen to PCP.
As the performance progressed, PCP went through its entire repertoire. The song list included both original compositions and covers of popular songs. Although interesting in novelty, it felt like the ensemble was showing off its ability to cross over, never committing to a specific style and, in the end, leaving listeners with a good impression, but nothing truly transcendental.
PCP played a variety of pieces, including a fun song composed by one of its members featuring a medley of familiar popular music styles and a purely classical number that bored the audience, but proved the members’ talent as musicians. Then, even though they might strike anyone as complete opposites, PCP covered Pantera’s “Mouth For War” which was reminiscent to what Apocalyptica did in its redoings of Metallica songs.
Once its had the crowd’s complete attention, PCP played two very fun covers — Britney Spears’ “Toxic” and Outkast’s “Hey Ya” — which ultimately won over the crowd.
Nothing truly awe-inspiring happened on stage, however, with the talented four-piece ensemble. The Portland Cello Project proved that it was able to keep its composure, even when the crowd’s disinterest was palpable. The group was creative yet cautious, carefully choosing its playlist for the night, but failing to produce anything that had not yet been done by a classical ensemble in today’s music industry.
PCP did what people expected it to do, and at the show’s end, it spiced things up with two mainstream covers.
PCP proved to be a conversation starter for Thao with The Get Down Stay Down.
Although Thao and her band put on an electrifying performance, PCP showed that even though classical is not as “hip” as rock music,  all art is about true emotion.

In an office, every employee, no matter how lowly, is entitled to his own workspace. As a file clerk, I had a pretty little cubicle to call my own. The paralegals were the proud owners of the slightly larger cubicles with fancy trappings, like legroom. The attorneys had smaller offices with the luxury of fully functioning doors, while the partners enjoyed the crème de la crème of office space: the coveted corner office.
When Human Resources escorts a new employee to his desk on his first day of work, there’s immediately a sense of ownership.  But in reality, this space isn’t his at all, and neither is anything inside: not the swivel chair, not the Swingline, not the Post-it notes or the ballpoint pens. Just because this space feels like “yours” doesn’t mean you have free rein to do whatever you want with it.
Based on the behavior of my co-workers, this belief is not widely shared.
Some desk etiquette offenses are frowned upon, but not wholly sinful. For example, one secretary chose to display 8×10-inch framed photos of herself on her desk — solo portrait-style pictures that gave a whole new meaning to the word vain.
Another secretary, in lieu of glamour shots, decided to print off pictures from the Internet and then tape them around her cubicle. The most prominent of these was a photo of American Idol runner-up Adam Lambert gripping a microphone with his black fingernails. Being a 48-year-old woman who is obsessed with an American Idol contestant is somewhat pathetic, but to be a 48-year-old woman who is not embarrassed to be obsessed with an American Idol contestant is truly off-putting.
One of my other colleagues was a male paralegal who, in spite of his gender, could easily be the sixth member of The Real Housewives of Atlanta.  He would listen to music on his computer while he worked, snapping in a “Z” formation all the while. Though listening to music during work hours is not exactly encouraged, it’s not reprimanded either, provided that the volume is kept at an appropriate level. But just as you hide every sign of your obsession with Jeff Fatt from the Wiggles, you should also do everything in your power to prevent your coworkers from finding out you’re a 35-year-old man who listens to Madonna.
All of these offenses can be classified as mild embarrassments and abuses of the workspace. With the exception of one secretary who vomited at her desk after consuming too much Airborne, I took the cake when it came to improper desk etiquette.
I had been engaging in some minor text flirtation with one of the summer associates, a Rutgers University law student, for several weeks. It wasn’t long before I developed what can only be described as a full-fledged crush.
One afternoon, I decided to call his office voicemail so I could hear the sound of his voice (one straightjacket, coming right up).  He worked upstairs, so I went up and lurked around a corner to confirm that he and his law school buddies were still on their lunch break.
When I saw that they weren’t at their desks, I darted back to my cubicle and, less than 90 seconds later, dialed his extension.
When I was just one ring away from hearing that voicemail message, he picked up.
“Hello?”
Completely caught off-guard, I slammed down the phone and went back to work, forgetting that the office phones are programmed with a caller-ID feature.
Five minutes later, I received that text message I wanted so badly.
“Did you just call?”
“No, must have been the other Kelsey.”
There were no other Kelseys.
Needless to say, I didn’t hear from him again for a long time after that. Lesson learned: Only use the company phone for business purposes. Creeping on a crush does not, in any way, qualify as a “business purpose.”
But the lesson extends far beyond that. It’s easy to forget that the desk, the phone, the hole-punch and the computer don’t really belong to you. The employer has every right to dictate what you can and cannot do within the confines of what you always believed to be your workspace.
Sure, the rules of desk etiquette can be a little constricting, but in the end, it seems like the Human Resources department really does know what’s best when it comes to preventing shame and preserving dignity.
In the case of office appropriate vs. awfully inappropriate, it is the judgment of this column that you should serve a life sentence as the laughingstock of the law firm should you treat your workspace like your home.

In an effort to recognize the importance of teaching, the Rossier School of Education partnered with 2tor, Inc — a company that provides online education along with universities — to create an innovative platform to show appreciation for teachers, using new media.
The website, “My Teacher, My Hero,” was launched in conjunction with the Rossier’s new Masters of Arts in Teaching online course, MAT@USC. The website allows people to upload videos of themselves thanking their teachers and emphasizing the importance of the profession.
“[It] shows people who are considering becoming teachers how important and impactful the profession is,” said Margo Pensavalle, associate professor of clinical education.
The purpose of My Teacher, My Hero is two-fold, said Jeremy Johnson, 2tor chief technology officer. The site is run by MAT@USC and 2tor and is a vehicle to promote the new program and show interested applicants how to receive more information.
The site hopes to “help raise the status of teachers in our society” by hosting numerous videos from “leaders in film, entertainment, and politics that are speaking about how their teachers impacted their lives,” Johnson said.
Contributors who have already uploaded video to the site include Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, musician Sean Paul, Craigslist founder Craig Newmark and president of HBO Entertainment Sue Naegle.
The creators of My Teacher, My Hero are hoping to get site visits from students, teachers and young children alike. The site will recognize teachers and show that people appreciate what they contribute. Johnson also wants parents and young children who visit the site to see the incredible impact teachers have on society.
They want to “show people that being a teacher is a rich [and] rewarding profession” and prospective teachers “should not feel as though others will not respect them,” Johnson said.
2tor chose to use video as a mechanism to recognize teachers because “video allows you to touch and feel something a little more acutely and be a little more involved,” according to Johnson.
The video submission process is user friendly, and social media tools make it simpler to share video. 2tor set up links to Facebook, Twitter and an email form to “make [uploading a video] easiest as possible.”
The onus is on the video submitter to share the video with the public and email it to their teacher, if they so choose, Johnson said.
USC students recognized the value of demonstrating appreciation for great teaching, but there were mixed opinions on whether they would actually upload videos.
“I’ve had good teachers, but not enough to put a video online,” said Jayson Kellogg, a sophomore majoring in philosophy.
Freshman Ann Jankowski, however, said she would upload a video for her favorite teacher in high school that wasn’t liked by many other students.
“I adored her and I want to show her that people care and she deserves to be acknowledged,” Jankowski, a theatre major, said.

In the coming weeks, the Los Angeles Department of Transportation will be analyzing its transit services to find ways to deal with impending budget deficits.
Though officials say it is unlikely the changes will affect the DASH that runs near USC, fares may increase and other lines may be cut in order to keep up with a rapidly depleting budget.
Wheels on the bus · The F DASH, which runs from USC to downtown daily, will likely remain in operation, but other lines may be cut and fares may go up as LADOT tries to save money. - Vicki Yang | Daily Trojan
“As funding has shrunk, it’s important to put the limited resources where they can count most,” said Bill Gillman, a spokesman for LADOT.
Gillman said LADOT is overdue for a line-by-line analysis evaluating the DASH, Commuter Express and Metro.
Philip Aker, transit planner and project development head, said a study conducted by an outside consultant projected that LADOT will face a $23-million deficit next year and a $260-million deficit in 10 years.
“We are going to have to increase revenue, cut services or a combination of both,” Aker said.
Aker said LADOT will likely need to increase its fares. Though he could not yet say what the fare raise would be, he did say it would be relatively small.
There are still no specific plans for what routes LADOT will cut, but spokesman Bill Gillman said the likelihood the F DASH — the line that runs near USC —  will be cut is low because of its strong ridership.
The LADOT should have preliminary recommendations in the next two weeks and a more concrete plan on how to combat the projected budget deficits in four weeks.
“This is just the very beginning of the very beginning of the stages. We have nothing specifically planned,” Gillman said.
Students who use LADOT services said the potential changes were worrisome.
Elisa Bravo, a freshman majoring in Spanish, said even a small fare increase for the transit services could affect how often she rides the Metro.
“I ride the bus because I use it to get around, and I already think it’s a bit expensive,” she said. “If prices go up, it will seem less attractive to ride it.”
“I think it’ll make public transportation more difficult if they start cutting,” Andrea Coulter, a junior majoring in fine arts said. “Unless they use the buses from the cut lines to focus on the ones that are frequently used.”
Coulter, who frequently takes the commuter express and occasionally uses other lines like the DASH, said the she would be able to pay fares if they were raised, but would prefer taking a car.
Hannah Huang, a senior majoring in Electrical Engineering who said she uses the bus for basic transport, said the changes could make things worse.
“Certain lines are already infrequent,” Huang said. “I’d have to bike more or try to get rides from friends.”
Mimi Honeycutt contributed to this report.

After a hiatus that lasted more than a year, a group of students have revived the International Relations Undergraduate Association to improve networking within the student body and provide avenues for students to publish their views on global affairs.
The club was originally founded in the early 1990s as a representative body for undergraduates studying in the School of International Relations, offering students a weekly meeting and occasional seminars and dinners with professors. The club became dormant in 2006, when most of the senior members graduated and no one continued the club.
In May, senior Julian Leuthold and sophomores Leah Mireles and Lindsey Patin decided that USC needed an outlet for students to meet and work with each other outside of the classroom, which led to the repurposed IRUA.
“I noticed from the engineering school and the business school that there is a lot of organization and interaction,” said Leuthold, who is majoring in business, and urban planning and development. “The by-product of this is that everybody knows each other. That hadn’t been nurtured in the international relations department. We wanted to promote a tight network and friendship.”
Patin and Leuthold said they wanted to avoid the gradual disinterest that caused the original club to stop activity, and are planning to achieve that through aggressive recruiting.
“The reason the club died out is because all the officers who were seniors graduated,” Patin said. “The best way to avoid another collapse is to recruit younger students and tell them to recruit younger students so that so we can maintain a strong number of members.”
In May, the group decided to hold an informational session to gauge interest in the club which saw more than 50 attendees — they said was enough to restart the club. Leuthold said they now have more than 150 people on their mailing list and regularly hold movie screenings, speakers and other events.
The underlying shift in the club, according to Leuthold, is an added emphasis on interaction within the club, Leuthold said. The club will also be attempting to create crossover opportunities for students to meet people from other majors and gain contacts that could be valuable for the future.
“First off, we want the social environment,” Leuthold said. “We want to create a platform in which students can interact with each other and develop relationships that will hopefully outlast their time at USC.”
The club is currently exploring new activities to attract more members and provide what students want. According to Patin, it is considering co-sponsoring events with other groups such as Model United Nations, as well as taking advantage of the large international community at USC to help students better understand the issues facing the world.
“I think the IRUA is really unique because if [students] want a social experience, we have that, and if they want a learning experience, we also have that,” said Clara Hill, a sophomore majoring in international relations, who is in charge of publicity and marketing. “International relations deals with the entire world, so many other disciplines fit into it.”
The club is also exploring new modes of communication. In addition to the traditional monthly journal, it will utilize a blog to publish students’ perspectives. The club will also take advantage of social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter for the first time to keep members and those interested in international relations updated on upcoming club activities as well as campus events.
Nina Rathbun, a lecturer in the School of International Relations and IRUA’s advisor, said she wants to leave the direction of the club up to the members.
“The students are the ones who are running the club,” Rathbun said. “They are doing the real leadership to get the club off the ground. My goal is that students own it and take the opportunity to further their understanding of international relations and the role they can play in it.”
Maggie Buckles, a USC alumna from the class of 2006 who served as IRUA president during the ‘05-’06 school year, said the use of social networking sites adds a different, interesting element to the club and may help generate more excitement about the major.
“We never really used electronic tools very much before. We would send people emails before meetings but weren’t really focused on connecting with them.
Students studying international relations who are members of the club said IRUA provided them an opportunity to talk to fellow students whom they would otherwise only see in class.
“Back in the 1930s in Paris, there were cafes where political scientists, philosophers and writers would meet to talk,” said Miruna Barnoschi, a freshman majoring in international relations and an active member of the club. “I feel that is what the IRUA is like. We have different opinions and can debate issues.”
Buckles said she suggested the club look to successful organizations on campus to see what people like and focus on leadership so the club doesn’t become dormant again.
“I was kind of surprised to hear that there was a decrease in participation,” she said. “It’s important to have officers who are active and organized. There have to be people to do things like plan and collect fees. If people aren’t willing to do that, then the club won’t be active.”
Now that Bush (#43) is gone and Obama is running the show, it’s time to bring it back!

SOUTH BEND, Ind. — After more than three hours bearing the cold, USC needed one more second, one more play and one more stand.
It got all three.
False alarm · USC’s defense celebrates its victory after what it thought was the final play of the game. The officials ruled that there was one second left on the clock, giving Notre Dame another chance, but the Trojans again prevented the Irish from scoring. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
The Trojans defense held strong on three straight passes to the end zone to stave off a furious Notre Dame comeback, securing a 34-27 win Saturday against the Fighting Irish at Notre Dame Stadium.
The win was USC’s eighth straight against Notre Dame. But unlike the previous three routs by the Trojans, Saturday’s game resembled the 2005 “Bush Push” game that was defined by a final dramatic drive.
Notre Dame took three potentially game-tying shots at the USC end zone, from the Trojans’ 4-yard line, but couldn’t complete the comeback. With nine seconds remaining, Notre Dame tight end Kyle Rudolph fought for a jump ball with USC cornerback T.J. Bryant in the corner of the end zone but was ruled out of bounds. On the next play, USC cornerback Josh Pinkard knocked down what he thought was the final play of the game as his teammates spilled onto the field to celebrate.
But officials ruled that there was one second left on the clock, setting up USC’s defense for one final stand.
“Whether we had to go back again or not, that just doubled the fun of trying to get it done,” USC coach Pete Carroll said.
A pass intended for Notre Dame wide receiver Duval Kamara fell to the ground to clinch USC’s win.
The last-second finish was unexpected for a USC team that had led 34-14 at the beginning of the fourth quarter. The Fighting Irish reeled off two quick touchdowns and came up with game-changing defensive plays, however, to keep the game competitive.
After two straight blowout wins against Washington State and Cal, USC found itself in a similar position to the early portion of the season when it faced closely contested games against Ohio State and Washington. USC linebacker Chris Galippo called the frantic finishes the “theme of the season.”
“This is the most stressed-out game I’ve had — way more than Ohio State,” Galippo said. “They just had chance after chance after chance.”
USC appeared to have the game in hand at the beginning of the fourth quarter when it led 34-14. But Notre Dame quarterback Jimmy Clausen fought off a slow start to rally his team to within a few yards of the upset. The Heisman Trophy candidate connected with wide receiver Golden Tate on a 45-yard touchdown pass and found Tate again for a 15-yard score to draw the Fighting Irish within seven.
Clausen finished 260 yards passing and three total touchdowns. His two touchdown passes were the first that USC’s defense had given up all year.
“He’s a great football player,” Carroll said. “We’ve known that since he was 14. You’re seeing the culmination of a career and all that here.”
But Clausen’s effort may have been eclipsed by USC quarterback Matt Barkley, who mirrored Clausen’s rise as a Southern California high school football legend. Barkley passed for a career-high 380 yards and two touchdowns on 19-of-29 passing.
The true freshman tore up a blitz-happy defense that left itself vulnerable in the secondary throughout the day. Holding onto the ball until the last second, Barkley repeatedly found his two favorite targets, Damian Williams and Anthony McCoy, for big gains.
After missing his first completion of the second half, Barkley completed seven straight passes for 195 yards.
“There’s no way to describe it because there’s nobody else to compare him to in our history,” Carroll said of Barkley’s performance. “He’s just so poised and so comfortable in the arena that it doesn’t really matter where we’re playing. It doesn’t affect him.”
Both Williams and McCoy finished with more than 100 yards receiving on the day. Williams had two touchdowns, including a 41-yard jaunt on a screen when an unsuccessful Notre Dame blitz left the Fighting Irish undermanned on the perimeter.
“I already knew I had [the touchdown] by the time I got the ball,” Williams said. “It was three-on-two and that usually works out for us.”
Carroll highlighted penalties and a lack of forced turnovers as two of the biggest reasons for the Trojans’ inability to close out in the fourth quarter. USC forced four fumbles but did not recover any of them.
The Trojans committed eight penalties for 70 yards but were flagged frequently in the second half at critical junctures. Senior safety Taylor Mays and redshirt sophomore defensive end Malik Jackson both earned personal foul penalties on the final drive to shorten the field for the Fighting Irish.
“I really think without the knuckleheaded 15-yarders that kept moving the football, we were going to be OK,” Carroll said of the final drive.
For a Notre Dame team whose last five games have all been decided by seven points or fewer, the failed final drive was devastating.
“We just were hoping that we would score, and when we didn’t, it was like someone drove a knife into our hearts,” said Notre Dame linebacker Brian Smith.
The frigid weather and close finish may not have been to the Trojans’ liking, but the atmosphere served as an initiation into a storied history for many of the players.
“I kind of understand now why this rivalry is so big,” Barkley said.
Ahhh!  The Trojans finally came to play in earnest.  It was awesome to see the defense pull together at the end.  Job well done!!

USC’s offense had its signature win against Ohio State. The Trojans on defense now have theirs.
USC’s 34-27 victory over Notre Dame — culminating in a last second goal-line stand — caused Trojan fans just as much emotional strain as the win over the Buckeyes, but carried much more weight.
Trojan strength · Everson Griffen was penalized for flexing his muscles after a sack, but he and the Trojans were able to move on. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
Why? Because it happened on that field, in that rivalry.
The Fighting Irish had all the momentum in the final minutes and were getting all the favorable calls as they drove down to the USC 4-yardline, trailing by one touchdown. In just under 10 seconds, they would have three chances to tie the game.
Each time, USC’s defense answered the call.
“This seems to be the theme of our season — close situations,” redshirt sophomore linebacker Chris Galippo said.
It didn’t even bother the Trojans that they had to win the game twice. After Irish quarterback Jimmy Clausen’s first attempt fell incomplete, he lined up with four seconds on the clock and threw a pass to junior wide receiver Golden Tate that hit the ground as the clocked clicked down to double-zeroes.
The Trojans started rushing the field to celebrate their eighth-straight victory over Notre Dame, before the officials announced that they would review the previous play to see exactly where the time ended.
Talk about throwing a bone to Notre Dame. How often does the clock stop precisely when a pass falls incomplete? And it should go both ways — I doubt they checked if the clock started exactly when Clausen snapped the ball.
But even though USC fans were probably punching their TVs and cursing the officiating crew, the Trojans on the field didn’t seem to mind.
They just went out and did it all over again, providing blanket coverage on another Clausen pass and sealing up the win in a signature stand.
“It was a great moment,”  USC coach Pete Carroll said. “Whether we had to go back again or not, that just doubled the fun of trying to get it done.”
For those Trojans on the sidelines, it might have been a bit more stressful.
“I don’t know how many chances you can get,” redshirt junior receiver Damian Williams said, adding, “They got off three plays in nine seconds — I’ve never heard of that. But our defense did a great job.”
Ironically, the defense did not play well during a long stretch in the game. Quarterback Matt Barkley and the Trojan offense seemed to put the game out of reach, building a 20-point lead early in the fourth quarter. But Clausen capitalized on the somewhat complacent Trojans, scoring two touchdowns fairly easily and getting in position to win the game at the end.
But for all the mistakes and blown coverages, the Trojans came through mentally when it counted.
They were able to overcome four personal foul penalties in the second half, three of which were blatantly bad calls — especially the one on junior defensive end Everson Griffen for excessive celebration when he flexed his muscles after sacking Clausen. (Count how many times that same celebration is made the rest of the season and not called a penalty. Believe me, you’ll need more than just your fingers and toes.)
USC redshirt senior safety Josh Pinkard admitted the bad calls frustrated him — “Goodness, let us play man,” he said he was thinking — but it never affected him beyond that. After all, Pinkard was the one who broke up Clausen’s pass to Tate on the second to last play of the game.
The Trojan defense as a unit wasn’t fazed either, keeping the most important play — the current one — at the forefront of its mind.
“They maintained a level of poise to make the right decision at that time,” defensive coordinator Rocky Seto said.
It is not only the gap in talent level that has allowed USC to dominate Notre Dame over this past decade. It’s not the X’s and O’s either.
What it comes down to is the mentality, the winning attitude that Carroll has so completely cultivated in his players’ minds so that they never think games are going to end in anything but W’s.
“Everyone in that huddle, everybody on that sidelines — that’s all we’ve known,” Carroll said. “We prepared our mindset [so] that’s all we know.”
As clear as this is on USC’s sidelines, it’s also clear how much it is apparently lacking on Notre Dame’s. You could hear it in Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis’ words leading up to this week’s game. You could see it in the desperation the Irish played with Saturday and with which their fans cheered. They were begging for this game, a longing dating back to 2001.
But wanting it bad enough doesn’t win games. When it comes down to it, believing in yourself and your team separates the champions from the wannabes. The USC defense came through because it never doubted that it would.
“You want to have that mentality if it goes to that last play,” Carroll said. “We’ve been talking that way and preparing the way we prepare to build legitimacy to that mindset. Again, we had a chance to back it.”
The defense certainly took advantage of that chance to back it up, giving Trojan fans another game to be remembered in the USC-Notre Dame rivalry and another reminder why USC’s remarkable run under Carroll doesn’t seem to be stopping any time soon.

For the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team, the weekends keep passing and the wins keep coming.
This weekend was nothing out of the ordinary in regards to the outcome, as the Trojans secured their 17th victory of the season with a 9-4 win over No. 7 Long Beach State. Senior two-meter Shea Buckner had a hat trick, and senior driver Anthony Artukovich and redshirt junior driver Kyle Sterling added two more scores each to lead USC (17-1, 4-0).

“We had a very hard week of training this past week, and our guys were tired,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “We played really good defense in the game; Buckner and [Matthew] Burton did a good job in the two-meter defense. We ended up stealing the ball often and forcing Long Beach into many bad passes.”
The game itself could be considered a break for the Trojans, who pulled ahead on two early scores and never looked back. Senior two-meter J.W. Krumpholz struck first, and then set up a penalty shot that Buckner converted to give USC the 2-0 advantage. Two consecutive goals by Sterling, one each in the first and second periods, put the Trojans up 4-2 going into the half.
Buckner opened up the second half with a quick goal, but Long Beach’s Joe Sherrin responded with a 6-on-5 score of his own to keep the difference at two.
The Trojans quickly found their stride again, though, as senior driver Justin Rappel scored and Artukovich found the net twice to put USC up 8-4 in three periods of play. The fourth quarter featured only one goal between the two teams, as Buckner was able to complete his hat trick and seal the 9-4 Trojan victory.
Defense was a strong point once again for the Trojans, as they recorded their ninth game this season in which they held their opponents to four goals or less.  Sophomore goalkeeper Joel Dennerley recorded 12 saves, bringing his season total to 115.
The weekend was unusual, however, in the sense that USC only played one match instead of two or more. Playing more than one game has become a normal trend for the Trojans; the Trojans played six matches last week, including four in the SoCal tournament in Irvine, Calif.
The team has also played at least two games every week since Sept. 12, when it played Long Beach State.
“We are focusing mainly now on recovering from all of the games,” Vavic said.  “We have so many games in a short period of time … In one weekend we had four games, and in the next four weeks we’re going have four games. We’re going to work on our conditioning and our strength in our legs, and make sure that we are very strong.”
The win brings the Trojans to 4-0 in conference play, as well as 5-0 at home. USC will face LMU next weekend at home, which will be the first time this season that the Trojans play only a single game during the weekend in back-to-back weeks.

Last week, the British court ruled in favor of releasing US intelligence documents on Guantanamo Bay torture cases, sparking an international uproar. Of course, there are the real-world issues of whether or not releasing the documents could compromise the “special relationship” that Britain enjoys with the United States.
More important in this case, however, is the question of ideology. On one side of this argument are the champions of human rights; on the other, those who stress another principle: the inviolability of intelligence sharing between nations.
Matteo Marjoram | Daily Trojan
Ultimately, the release of these documents is not something the United States should hold against its British ally.
It’s important not to neglect the very real ­­— if unspoken — factor of British humiliation. These documents are not dealing with American torture alone; rather, they are said to provide evidence in the case of Ethiopian-born Binyam Mohamed, who spent four years in Guantanamo Bay penitentiary and claims that British authorities colluded with Americans in his torture when he was in Morocco.
The British High Court decided to release the documents based on overwhelming public interest in the material. The judges felt it more important to come clean on the issue of torture than to uphold the principle of absolute secrecy in intelligence sharing.
The British government, however, is adamantly denying the torture allegations and swiftly appealed the court’s decision. The documents will not be released until that appeal goes through the courts.
Because the world already knows that the United States has committed torture in Guantanamo, no one will be shocked by the secrets revealed in the documents. If Britain had released these papers before the United States owned up to its own breaches of international law, then the principle of secrecy in shared intelligence would have been severely compromised. Britain’s national security would have been negatively affected, as foreign allies would no longer be willing to share information.
But most observers will agree that Britain’s national security will likely not be compromised in this instance.
The United States chose not to reveal those documents that would incriminate Britain for the sake of the alliance, not because it maligned America’s image in any way.
After all, it would be difficult to produce any new information more damning than the images and papers released from Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib.
Despite the relative insignificance of the actual information in these documents, American officials seem to be just as eager as the British government to protect the principle of secrecy — regardless of how it might compromise human rights.
Last July, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton informed British Foreign Secretary David Miliband that any breach of confidence would be considered a violation of intelligence-sharing codes. She also threatened that the United States would consider cutting security cooperation with the Britain.
Clinton is taking a hard-line approach to the issue because it fundamentally challenges her perceptions of how intelligence-sharing operations should be conducted. This case is an exception to the rule in that Britain’s reasons for releasing the information are domestic; it is not setting any true precedent for future intelligence policy.
And no matter what threats she may throw around, Clinton is not in a position to cut ties between Britain and the American intelligence community.
Britain is America’s closest ally; the information they can provide in the future is too valuable to be lost over this case.
Representatives of the British government have argued that they have no problem with releasing the documents, as long as US authorities are the ones to take that step.
Actually, this situation would have worked out very nicely for the British government, if it weren’t for the courts. Because Britain denied torture allegations, its public image will be severely compromised if the documents prove otherwise.
So, if everything had gone according to plan, not only would Britain have maintained its moral superiority over the United States and prevented a negative opinion abroad, but it also would have prevented any ill will across the Atlantic.
Unfortunately for Britain, the High Court chose moral ideology over realism and put human rights before international politics. It seems unlikely that they will change their position, unless the United States takes more dramatic steps — seriously threatening the shared-intelligence relationship.
If US officials do take such measures, it won’t be to anyone’s benefit. Besides, it’s about time the United States made human rights a priority.
Rosaleen O’Sullivan is a junior majoring in English and international relations. Her column, “Global Grind,” runs Mondays.
Rosaleen, your youthful enthusiasm for “human rights” is admirable but misguided. The last line of your article beautifully illustrates your ignorance. The United States has a far better record in “human rights” than any other country in recorded history, which is in fact a part of why so many people keep wanting to come here, illegally or not. “Human rights” is a far bigger issue, and encompasses a helluva lot more, than whether military officials went a little too far in trying to protect the “human rights” of all us of after 9/11.

Process of sustainability
I was disappointed reading Wednesday’s Daily Trojan article regarding USC’s most recent College Sustainability Report Card grade — not because of the grade itself, but the almost apologetic tone taken in discussing it. It appears to me that the university has nothing to apologize for as it continues to lead and innovate in its primary mission to educate and empower young minds. Notwithstanding Sustainability Manager Matt Oden’s unquestionable and enviable credentials, the debate over global warming and related green initiatives remains contentious and divided. As a proud alumnus, I take far more comfort in noticing USC’s remarkable growth in academic excellence and overall prestige.
Under the leadership of President Steven B. Sample, USC has improved its core curriculum and academic rigor, increased it’s visibility and presence nationally and internationally, and secured unprecedented funding and financial solvency. Even Trojan athletics have returned to national prominence. Few institutions can match the complete experience offered to the students of USC.
Indeed, this growth includes physical improvements to the campus and its infrastructure, all of which should be done with sustainability in mind.
I am confident that the university will take a leadership role in sustainability as it continues building on and around the campus. Building a beautiful and functional campus should not be at odds with environmental causes, but both should be achieved in the context of USC’s fundamental role as one of the world’s finest universities.
I suppose it’s a shame that USC’s recent sustainability grade was not better, and certainly the university should continue looking for ways to improve. But in the end, the breadth and depth of USC’s excellence through the years should serve as sufficient evidence of its loyal partnership with its students, the neighborhood and the environment.

Individual change
Although I commend the Greek community for reaching out to the gay community by attending the event, the fact of whether or not gays and lesbians are completely welcomed by fraternities and sororities doesn’t necessarily rely on changing the system itself. The time when gays and lesbians are finally accepted for who they are depends more on the openness of the individuals in the Greek community, and their decision to change themselves in order to finally reject false stigmas and stereotypes surrounding gays and the gay community.

The No. 9 USC women’s soccer team needed an enormous effort to push pass Cal Sunday, and it came from the smallest player on the field who rose up above everyone and provided the golden touch.
Junior midfielder Alyssa Dávila scored the golden goal on a header in the first overtime as USC (11-4, 3-1) avoided a Bay Area sweep by beating No. 17 Cal 3-2. USC was blanked by No. 1 Stanford 4-0 Friday.
After being denied once on a header in overtime by the Cal goalkeeper, Dávila wasn’t going to let it happen again. On USC’s second corner of the period, senior defender Meagan Holmes flicked a header to Dávila who headed it past the goalkeeper for her second goal of the game and the game winner.
“I don’t know if players underestimate my size or whatnot, but I think I’m just good at moving players and being sneaky,” Dávila said.
The Women of Troy were lucky to even reach the overtime period, as Cal came out in the second half and took it right at them. They had shots clank off the crossbar and had two goals called back because of offsides.
But USC’s defense finally cracked and blew the lead. Sophomore Miranda White scored in the 74th minute to cut USC’s lead to 2-1 and then she assisted on junior Alex Morgan’s goal in the 78th minute.
“They just out worked us,” coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “I think we were fortunate to even get into the overtime period. But in overtime, the ladies made a choice to put the game away and I think it shows the character of our young team.”
USC jumped out to the early lead thanks to goals by sophomore forward Ashley Freyer and Davila. Freyer got on the end of a Marihelen Tomer cross in the 19th minute and Dávila followed that in the 31st minute by gathering in a long ball from goalkeeper Kristen Olsen and putting it in the back of the net.
The Women of Troy were able to come back after giving up the lead, but they weren’t as fortunate on Friday as they lost to No. 1 Stanford 4-0. The loss ended USC’s nine-game winning streak.
The Cardinal outplayed USC for most of the game, yet the Women of Troy held their own as they went into halftime tied 0-0.
But Stanford came out in the second half and unleashed on Olsen and USC. The Cardinal scored four goals in 15 minutes in the second half to put the game away.
“We just didn’t step on the field with a lot of confidence,” Davila said.
Khosroshahin said that the Women of Troy need to play intelligently and recognize proper matchups rather than relying on their athleticism. He said that’s what hurt them in the second half of both games.
“We didn’t adjust to the adjustments they made at halftime,” Khosroshahin said. “It was brutal to watch and be a part of, but we learned valuable lessons about what it takes to be the best team in the country.”
After giving up only three goals in the last nine games, USC gave up six goals in two games this weekend, and all six goals were in the second half.
“We need to come out harder in the second half and we need to know that teams will come out fired up and ready to come at us,” Holmes said. “We need to have the mentality to keep pressuring them no matter what the score is.”
That mentality comes with experience, and that’s something the young Women of Troy are gaining everyday. Six starters are sophomores or freshman. As long as the team improves, Khosroshahin expects the results will come later in the year.

With temperatures approaching 100 degrees in the San Fernando Valley on Friday, the USC Women’s Cross Country team did not wilt in the heat at the Cal State Northridge Invitational.
The Women of Troy turned in their second consecutive strong performance, finishing 2nd overall to Cal State Fullerton in a race shortened from a 6K to a 5K due to scorching temperatures in Van Nuys.
The temperature at race time was 98 degrees with 16 percent humidity. Coach Tom Walsh said he agreed with the decision to shorten the race.
“It was the right way to go,” Walsh said. “With the intense heat, you don’t want to take a chance with the health of the athletes. It wasn’t worth it.”
Even in the heat, USC fulfilled Walsh’s expectations. Several runners turned in solid performances, including freshman Theresa Kurth, who was USC’s fourth runner on Friday. Junior Zsofia Erdelyi finished 3rd overall to lead the Women of Troy, despite suffering from a flu bug which has plagued her and the team for most of the season.
“The fact that she is still sick has me very concerned,” Walsh said of his star runner. “I thought the flu had moved through but the fact that it is still here means we’ll have to keep monitoring our health and make sure we avoid really getting sick.”
Junior Christine Cortez continued to look like USC’s second-in-command runner, finishing 13th overall, and senior captain Bridget Helgerson was right behind her, finishing 16th. Kurth was 4th for USC, and rounding out the top 5 was junior Zara Lukens, who was 20th overall. Walsh was especially pleased with how the team ran as a collective group.
“We finally put together a really strong start to the race,” Walsh said. “They were very aggressive. They ran their fastest first miles of the season. If we can combine the first half of this Northridge race with the second half of the Vanguard meet, we’ll be in great shape.”
With Pac-10 Championships less than two weeks away, Walsh says that Friday’s meet made it much more complicated for him to choose his final roster.
“Some of the performances on Friday have made things a bit difficult,” Walsh said. “I was really impressed with Theresa Kurth and a few others who I didn’t expect to be up there.”
Walsh said he expects to pick which runners he will take the Pac-10’s later this week, and send those who are not running to Friday’s Cal State Fullerton Invitational. With his team performing at a high level, though, Walsh says health, not performance, is his biggest concern heading into the season’s homestretch.
“The pieces are there for a strong showing at Pac-10’s,” Walsh said. “It’s just this flu bug that we’ve got to get over. If we do that, we’ll be fine.”

The No. 4 Washington Huskies rallied late Saturday for a Pac-10 victory over the No. 16 USC women’s volleyball team, 3-2 (25-21, 22-25, 24-26, 25-20, 15-10), as the Women of Troy suffered their fourth consecutive loss.
Bianca Rowland led for the Huskies with 15 kills and no errors for a .625 evening (15-0-24) as the Huskies avoided their first home loss of the season limiting USC to .071 and .077 hitting in the final two sets.
“We played a real nice match but just didn’t finish,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “To take Washington to five in their own building is a good thing. We played four of the five games really well.”
Rowland broke a 7-7 fifth-set tie with a kill that sparked Washington to three straight points and a victory. Kindra Carlson posted a team-high 18 kills with three aces and 15 digs, while Jill Collymore had 16 kills and 17 digs for Washington (17-1, 7-1).  Jenna Hagglund recorded 57 assists and 12 digs while Tamari Miyashiro had 30 digs.
USC sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter led all players with 25 kills to go with 13 digs.  Senior outside hitter Jessica Gysin (14 kills, 15 digs) and junior opposite hitter Kimmee Roleder (13 kills, 16 digs) also recorded double-doubles for the Women of Troy (13-6, 2-5), while Kendall Bateman chipped in 53 assists and nine digs.  Senior libero Alli Hillgren matched Miyashiro with 29 digs in the match.
Although the Women of Troy dropped another road match, Haley was proud of the way his team played.
“I’m hoping this is a turn around and a focus forward by this group,” he said. “They seem to have gotten out of their trance and now need to stay focused and stay forward.”
Saturday’s defeat followed an upset loss against unranked Washington State Friday night, where the Women of Troy played out of sync the entire match as the Cougars swept the USC (25-17, 28-26, 25-23).
“We started off bad in the first set,” Haley said. “We had a couple of good performances by specific players, but we couldn’t get it together until it was too late.”
Jupiter continued her strong play with 21 kills and nine digs, and a career-high four serving aces Roleder recorded 15 kills and hit .414 and Bateman had 42 assists and eight digs.
Haley admits his team has not played well away from the Galen Center this season, which is why he is looking forward to this weekend’s matches against Oregon and Oregon State at USC.
“We have to have those wins if we have to get back into this,” Haley said. “But Oregon beat Stanford this weekend, and we went five with Washington, so it’s up in the air.”
USC hosts Oregon State Friday evening and Oregon Saturday afternoon, as the Women of Troy try to get back on track.
“I felt like this weekend we played better volleyball and we were more productive,” said Haley of his team’s recent slide. “If the blocking improves now, the defense in the back row will too, and we’ll be better off.”

SOUTH BEND, Ind. — After more than three hours bearing the cold, USC needed one more second, one more play and one more stand.
It got all three.
The Trojans defense held strong on three-straight passes to the end zone to stave off a furious Notre Dame comeback, securing a 34-27 win Saturday against the Fighting Irish at Notre Dame Stadium.
The USC Trojan defense celebrates after what they thought was the last play of the game. Notre Dame got one more chance, but the defense came through with the stop. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
The win was USC’s eighth straight against Notre Dame. But unlike the previous three routs by the Trojans, Saturday’s game resembled the 2005 “Bush Push” game that was defined by a final dramatic drive.
Notre Dame took three potentially game-tying shots at the USC end zone from the Trojans’ 4-yard line, but couldn’t complete the comeback. With nine seconds remaining, Notre Dame tight end Kyle Rudolph fought for a jump ball with USC cornerback T.J. Bryant in the corner of the end zone but was ruled out of bounds. On the next play, USC cornerback Josh Pinkard knocked down what he thought was the final play of the game as his teammates spilled onto the field to celebrate.
But officials ruled that there was one second left on the clock, setting up USC’s defense for one final stand.
“Whether we had to go back again or not, that just doubled the fun of trying to get it done,” USC coach Pete Carroll said.
A pass intended for Notre Dame wide receiver Duval Kamara fell to the ground to clinch USC’s win.
The last-second finish came as unexpected to a USC team that had led 34-14 at the beginning of the fourth quarter. The Fighting Irish reeled off two quick touchdowns and came up with game-changing defensive plays, however, to keep the game competitive.
After two straight blowout wins against Washington State and Cal, USC found itself in a similar position to the early portion of the season when it faced closely contested games against Ohio State and Washington. USC linebacker Chris Galippo called the frantic finishes the “theme of the season.”
“This is the most stressed-out game I’ve had – way more than Ohio State,” Galippo said. “They just had chance after chance after chance.”
USC appeared to have the game in hand at the beginning of the fourth quarter when it led 34-14. But Notre Dame quarterback Jimmy Clausen fought off a slow start to rally his team to within a few yards of the upset. The Heisman Trophy candidate connected with wide receiver Golden Tate on a 45-yard touchdown pass and found Tate again for a 15-yard score to draw the Fighting Irish within seven.
Clausen finished 260 yards passing and three total touchdowns. His two touchdown passes were the first that USC’s defense had given up all year.
“He’s a great football player,” Carroll said. “We’ve known that since he was 14. You’re seeing the culmination of a career and all that here.”
But Clausen’s effort may have been eclipsed by USC quarterback Matt Barkley, who mirrored Clausen’s rise as a southern California high school football legend. Barkley passed for a career-high 380 yards and two touchdowns on 19-of-29 passing.
The true freshman tore up a blitz-happy defense that left itself vulnerable in the secondary throughout the day. Holding onto the ball until the last second, Barkley repeatedly found his two favorite targets, Damian Williams and Anthony McCoy, for big gains.
After missing his first completion of the second half, Barkley completed seven straight passes for 195 yards.
“There’s no way to describe it because there’s nobody else to compare him to in our history,” Carroll said of Barkley’s performance. “He’s just so poised and so comfortable in the arena that it doesn’t really matter where we’re playing; it doesn’t affect him.”
Both Williams and McCoy finished with more than 100 yards receiving on the day. Williams had two touchdowns, including a 41-yard jaunt on a screen when an unsuccessful Notre Dame blitz left the Fighting Irish undermanned on the perimeter.
“I already knew I had [the touchdown] by the time I got the ball,” Williams said. “It was three-on-two and that usually works out for us.”
Carroll highlighted penalties and a lack of forced turnovers as two of the biggest reasons for the Trojans’ inability to close out in the fourth quarter. USC forced four fumbles but did not recover any of them.
The Trojans committed eight penalties for 70 yards but were flagged frequently in the second half at critical junctures. Senior safety Taylor Mays and redshirt sophomore defensive end Malik Jackson both earned personal foul penalties on the final drive to shorten the field for the Fighting Irish.
“I really think without the knuckleheaded 15-yarders that kept moving the football, we were going to be OK,” Carroll said of the final drive.
For a Notre Dame team whose last five games have all been decided by seven points or fewer, the failed final drive was devastating.
“We just were hoping that we would score, and when we didn’t, it was like someone drove a knife into our hearts,” said Notre Dame linebacker Brian Smith.
The frigid weather and close finish may not have been to the Trojans’ liking, but the atmosphere served as an initiation into a storied history for many of the players.
“I kind of understand now why this rivalry is so big,” Barkley said.
I attended my first Trojan game in the Coliseum in 1956. Since then, I’ve made something of a study of the ND/USC match up. The first time Pac 10 officials were “allowed” in South Bend; it was the “Bush Push” AKA a great Trojan victory. On average, due to bad spots and ridiculous officials (22 times from Division 2 conferences… that’s right… ND gets to pick them), our Trojans give up 50 plus yards whenever they play @ ND. While I agree with Coach Carroll that “knucklehead” describes some of the infractions our D sustained; I also know from the footballers with whom I attended USC (2 time National Champions); ND players and coaches throw around the “N Word” and other such Papal rhetoric to incite our Men of Troy. We were luck to win yesterday. As 3 generations of Trojans in my family have said, “Any year we beat Notre Dame is a great year.” Fight On! Beat the Beavers!
