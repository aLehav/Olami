A record-breaking number of students attended rush events for sororities and fraternities during fall rush this year, with a potential new member class of 1,046 women rushing sororities.
The nine sororities participating in rush were encouraged to offer more bids this year as a result of the large class, which broke the previous record of 953, USC Panhellenic President Megan Lambert said. Houses offered 737 bids this semester, with about 70 to 90 pledges in each sorority’s class.
Roughly 300 students dropped out of Panhellenic’s rush and some students were not offered bids. Lambert said this happens every year, however.
“There’s no guarantee that women will be matched up with a chapter, unfortunately,” Lambert said.
USC Interfraternity Council President Michael Madden said official rush numbers will not be released until next week after IFC’s secondary rush ends. Madden said that, on average, more students attended rush events each night. Potential new members were asked to sign in to IFC’s computer system at each house they visited during rush events.
“Every single day we were getting 50 more check-ins than what we had last year and the years prior,” Madden said.
During house tours Sunday, for example, 1,054 potential new members signed in compared to 1021 students last year, Madden said.
About 400 students received bids from fraternities, but more bids will be offered during IFC’s secondary rush, Madden said. Secondary rush will be held at The Lab on Sunday from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.
Despite the logistical challenges created by the increased number of students during the rush process, Lambert said she saw the bigger rush class as a positive change overall.
“We are thrilled that there are so many women looking to join the Panhellenic community, and we can’t wait to welcome our new members,” she said.
I heard that Beta and Phi Delt are in Tertiary Rush right now.  So if you got dropped from your #1 and #2 picks, visit Beta and Phi Delt for your bid package.
ATO is currently in the second or third round of Teriyaki rush
ATO is only about half asian so why are you talking smack on the DT site?  Beta is a progressive, fabulous group of guys, and if you are the curious type I would check them out.
If you are interested, Kappa Sig is still taking guys

Most freshmen enter USC straight out of high school with limited life experiences. Twenty-two-year-old screenwriting major Ilan Benjamin, however, is starting his freshman year at USC after spending 2 1/2 years in the Israeli army — and wrote a book about the experience.

Benjamin grew up in Oakland, Calif. His father is Israeli, and Benjamin’s family visited Israel many times throughout Benjamin’s childhood. On one such visit, they gave a soldier a ride.
The experience had a profound impact on Benjamin.
“To me, [this soldier] was the epitome of everything cool and important and meaningful,” Benjamin said. “At eight years old, I knew this was someone I wanted to emulate.”
When Benjamin took another trip to Israel at age 16, he was sure he wanted to serve in the army.
“Israel is surrounded by enemies. … It’s a miracle Israel exists,” he said.
Benjamin’s parents did not take his wish to serve seriously until he refused to fill out college applications, and instead chose to enlist in the army.
“I needed time to experience real life,” Benjamin said. “I wanted something to write about.”
During his years in Israel, Benjamin found inspiration for his writing. When asked to describe his experience, he said his time in the army was “every adjective you could imagine.”
“We got through the hard stuff with laughter,” Benjamin said. “I had a lot of fun, but it could be scary and intense.”
The Israeli soldiers were guarding the country against an enemy who “wanted to drive every Jew into the sea.”
Most of his worst experiences occurred when he was stationed at Har Dov, a disputed territory also known as Shebaa Farms.
Located in the mountains, Har Dov stood far from civilization.
“You could go a little crazy,” Benjamin said.
Har Dov is perhaps the hardest place to guard in Israel, because the enemy was extremely close.
“It was scary to see them, but scarier when the fog came in and we couldn’t see,” Benjamin said.
Not all the places Benjamin was stationed, though, were so trying. While serving on the Gaza Strip, Benjamin interacted with the people he was protecting. Observing children studying in bomb shelters made the experience “feel meaningful.”
“Everyone lives in constant fear of bombardment,” Benjamin said.
Benjamin wrote throughout his experience. All of his stories were written in the moment, based on his urges and the trials of the people he met.
“My stories were a way of venting. … Writing was like therapy,” Benjamin said. “Fiction guarded me. There’s a difference between saying, ‘He did this’ and saying, ‘I did this.’”
Benjamin never intended for the tales to become a book, but after his service, he noticed they all connected.
He could not, however, find a publisher willing to sell his short stories. Benjamin was told  nonfiction sells much better. Benjamin, however, preferred fictional stories.
“Nonfiction is like a glorified diary. … It wouldn’t have captured the experience as well,” he said.
Benjamin started a campaign on Kickstarter to pay for professional editing, layout and distribution costs. The campaign has already surpassed its $3,000 goal.
“I’m grateful to everybody and everything,” Benjamin said. “My supporters mean the world to me.”
Thanks to help from family, friends and strangers, Benjamin’s book Masa: The Stories of a Lone Soldier will be available on Amazon in December.
For now, Benjamin has thrown himself into life at USC.
“Being accepted into the screenwriting program was a dream come true,” Benjamin said.
Already involved in several film-related projects, Benjamin cannot wait to “write like crazy” in the future. Ultimately, he wants to make a documentary using some of the footage he shot in Israel.
“Since I finished serving, my life has been amazing. I appreciate everything,” Benjamin said.
While being a 22-year-old freshman means he sometimes must deal with immaturity and “dumb questions” about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Benjamin said he loves living in New/North Residential College.
“I try to treat everyone as an equal and surround myself with more mature people,” Benjamin said, “But that’s not to say I can’t be immature too.”
Though he said he is enjoying his time at USC, Benjamin does miss aspects of Israel: the food, the people and even the army.
He also misses the “blunt” nature of the Israeli people.
“There is no political correctness in Israel,” Benjamin said. “It rubbed off on me; I’m a straightforward guy.”
Both cultures will always be a part of his identity: “Here, I feel Israeli. There, I feel American. America and Israel are two flawed but beautiful countries. Both are worth defending and being proud of.”
Thank you for covering this human interest story. I found it very interesting and would like to welcome Ilan to the Trojan family. Your background and experiences are a great addition to our diverse community at USC.
Can’t the Daily Trojan find someone who served in the US Armed Forces and do a story on them?  I served in the USMC then went to college on the GI Bill.
Funny how out of all the foreign nationals entering USC, the DT decides to run story on an Israeli Soldier’s perspective–even odder that the subject, Private Benjamin, feels the need to apologize to the author, Ms. Wanless, as though this idea was fed to her and not of her own volition and thus she unknowingly has been victimized, by writing a story she was lead to believe would be, I suppose, instructional. Perhaps it is Srgt. Benjamin who has been victimized by his handlers.
All hail Hillel–obviously this story was set-up through and by them. The DT should be smarter than being part of the Hillel Propoganda machine. 
Oh, John, try living in Palestine to get some perspective. But, the Israelis wont let you in, just like they wont let them out, a true ghetto.
Long live aparteid, Israeli style!
Lol. Way to miss the point, Vince. He just wrote a whole blog post about how we should listen to both sides and you respond by continuing to belittle Israel. Nice.
No body comes begging to the US for money like the Israelis, and nobody coerces our Congressmen better/worse than does AIPAC. It’s really disgraceful, but nothing is more disgraceful than the way Israel treats the Palestinians, and that is a fact you supporters apparently cannot live with.
Do your own dirty work with your own money. Stop acting like you are respresenting anyones interests other than your own. You are not the beacon of freedom in  the middle east. Your policies are a big part of the problem and not the solution.
I believe there are more Israeli spies in US jails than there are Russian/Chinese combined. 
With friends like Israel who needs enemies?
Really, you all need to grow up and get the stars out of your eyes.
You are truly despicable, Nancy. You have neither perspective nor internal logic. Why don’t you spend a few months living in Israel/Palestine before you open your fat mouth and pretend you know the whole story. Such a disgrace.
My response: http://www.ilanbenjamin.com/?p=156
Holly cow Batman, who paid for this article, AIPAC?
Come on Daily Trojan, you should be above this obvious pandering.
d
GlM,
Your party-line denial is offensive. The world is well aware that Israel is at the top of Amnesty International’s list of human rights  abusers–fact. If you think Israeli arabs have the same rights as Jews in Israel , you must be from Mars. For every Israeli that dies, 40 Palestinians die–fact. Israel did indeed steal and continues to steal whatever they want with little or no repercussions. If you think Israel is a democracy then you don’t know what a democracy is. Just because you wear uniforms and fly US jets does not make you the non-terrorists, If you think Israelis are closer to God than are Palestinians, then you are a racist. 
Ignorance is excusible, bias is just plain wrong and you are biased at worst and ignorant at best. Either way, your denial of the other side of the arguement is nausiating.
You are a fool.  Your “facts” are fiction.  Where does the article say ANYTHING about Israelis being “closer to God than Palestinians”? There is NO argument being made Max.  This is a human interest story about a former soldier who is now a student.
If you want to cite facts, how about some sources to back them up?
And (a small pre-emptive strike here) sources that are traditionally unbiased.  
If you have faith in your claims, you will produce this evidence.  Good luck
Kol hakavod and fight on! Graduated in 2011 and now in the IDF. Rep it at sc for chayelim boddedim
Jaqui!
I love you!!! You and Deb are the best people!
-atlanta
Of course, Israel is surrounded by enemies–Israel has stolen everything they have!
Wow Anne and Chris!  You have produced one of the most ignorant, baseless, and biased liberal statements I have ever heard. Let alone from an readers of the Daily Trojan.
Every freedom-loving US citizen should be proud of Ilan as he is heading to fight for the only western- thinking, democratic, and technologically advanced societies in the Middle East, let alone the world. He protects the freedom of millions of people threatened by terrorist, suicide bombings every day and makes sure that Iran is too scared shitless to threaten non-Muslim nations with nuclear war.
To speak of “abuse of Palestinian rights,” or to say “Of course they have enemies. Israel has stolen everything they have,” shows such a lack of being informed or to have any knowledge whatsoever about the Middle East conflict, and is an embarrassment to such a great article and a top-tier school as USC.
Israel was the first government to create a nation and democratic autonomous state in the region, and initially offered the current “Palestinians” to live under their fare rule. Israeli Arabs have all the same rights as citizens as Jews and every other non-Jewish minority in the country. It is only those who chose  in 1948 to side with the invading Arab nations who wanted to drive the Jews and Israel into the sea and those who currently and constantly try to violently undermine civilian safety and order that have been barred from becoming Israeli citizens.
It is a tough situation to understand for whoever has no connection to Israel or the Jewish people. Exposure to left-wing media outlets such as college newspapers, CNN, and the New York Times, leaves a one-sided view of the situation in and around Israel who blame them for all the violence.
Learn the history, development, and the progress that is taking place in the State of Israel. Compare it to what is going on in Gaza and the West Bank. See what is happening in Syria; what has happened in Libya, Tunia, and Egypt.
Think twice before denigrating Israel. Focus on the real problems: Growing terrorist groups and nations in the Middle East.
Learn to appreciate good things: Ilan Benjamin, Israel, America, Freedom, Democracy, Capitalism, Philanthropy. 
Ilan Benjamin. You ROCK! Make us all proud with the next big Hollywood Blockbuster!
Wow, first-hand knowledge of how to abuse Palestinian rights.
Let’s get him on the podium.
[…] who interviewed me for the Daily Trojan, for not warning you. The subject of your article, “Student serves in Israeli army before starting at USC” was bound to incite anger and finger-wagging. The perspective of an ex-Israeli soldier is […]

USC is again facing a new set of potential NCAA violations.
Reports surfaced Saturday alleging former athletes Joe McKnight and Davon Jefferson received improper gifts from a Los Angeles County appraiser, according to the Los Angeles Times. The NCAA confirmed with the Times on Tuesday that it is investigating the allegations.
The Times obtained emails from the Los Angeles County’s assessor’s office, suggesting that Scott Schenter provided former running back Joe McKnight a car and an airline ticket and gave former basketball forward Davon Jefferson roughly $3,700 in cash.
The university will independently investigate the allegations, according to a statement released Saturday from USC Athletic Director Pat Haden.
“We have just learned of new allegations presented by a reporter from the Los Angeles Times,” Haden said. “We have discussed those allegations with the NCAA and Pac-12, and we will thoroughly investigate them and take any and all necessary actions.”
USC coach Lane Kiffin said Tuesday morning that he had yet to speak to his players about the McKnight allegations and remained unsure if he would do so.
“I don’t know if they even know about it,” Kiffin said. “It’s got nothing to do with them. We don’t even discuss it.”
McKnight played for the Trojans from 2007-09 before declaring for the NFL draft, where he was selected in the fourth round by the New York Jets. Jefferson was at USC for one season, 2007-08, before similarly declaring for the NBA draft, but he was not taken. The NCAA has a four-year statute of limitations on rule violations.
Though USC football is coming off a two-year postseason ban, the team still remains on probation following sanctions handed down by the NCAA in June 2010. As a result, the university could be classified as a repeat violator if the NCAA finds that McKnight and Jefferson received improper benefits.
“I can personally assure you that USC takes its compliance obligations with NCAA and Pac-12 rules extremely seriously and we are dedicated to playing and competing the right way,” Haden said.
Schenter was first tied to McKnight in 2009 when the Times first reported McKnight had been seen driving a $27,000 Land Rover around the University Park Campus. The Land Rover had been registered under Schenter’s name. McKnight was then held out of the Trojans’ next game.

USC Hybrid High School, a new independent charter school developed by the USC Rossier School of Education, opened Tuesday at the World Trade Center in Downtown Los Angeles to 100 students.

The school, which caters to students in the USC area, is open to students seven days a week, year round. Each student is required to attend 35 hours of class per week and 180 days a year, and the school develops a personalized learning plan to fit their needs. There are currently 93 students enrolled, but enrollment will remain open.
“My hope is that my students begin to see this as the most interesting and fun place they have to hang out,” Executive Director David Dwyer said. “If we see that, we know we’ve created a successful environment for the students where we have a chance to advance them academically.”
Dwyer said they plan to heavily incorporate technology into the classroom to create a personalized learning system where students will work at their own pace to master the curriculum. Each student will receive a Macbook Air, which they will check out during the day while they are on campus, and an iPod Touch, which they can take anywhere.
“[The iPod] becomes their communication tool,” he said. “It’s their student ID, it’s their email system and it’s how they get lunch.”
Principal Stephanie McClay said the innovative part of the school is not the technology, but the personal attention that it allows. The technology will allow teachers to receive instant feedback on the progress of their students.
“Technology supports the personalized learning plans to take them forward,” Dywer said. “If we have 90 or 100 kids, they’re going to be all across the spectrum, so it really allows the teachers to individualize for every student.”
The school plans to graduate 100 percent of its students. Because of the mastery-based curriculum, each student must receive at least a “B” to pass a class.
McClay said the goal is to make the academic program so tailored to each student that no student considers the possibility of not finishing school.
“The student and teacher are going to keep going until the student gets it,” McClay said. “Giving a failing grade in our program is not acceptable from a teacher perspective.”
Los Angeles Unified School District Director of Charter Schools Jose Cole-Gutierrez said he looks forward to working with Hybrid High.
“A 100 percent graduation rate is one of the top-line goals for the district,” Cole-Gutierrez said. “We look forward to working with them to reach this goal. We also have high expectations that they will help us achieve 100 percent graduation.”
Dwyer said he has already seen plenty of enthusiasm from prospective students and families during open houses this summer.
“The extent of their happiness is a surprise,” he said. “They’re all committed to a new way of working. They understand this is going to be different.”
Wonderful news, but it seems a lot of details are not included in the article.  What grades (I get that it’s high school, did it start with just 9th grade or each year).  What’s the application/enrollment process?  Is it local area kids? How many teachers?  What is hybrid about it?  Does it include professors from USC?

Three incidents of police violence caught on tape that emerged last week have renewed a decades-long controversy over how the Los Angeles Police Department conducts itself.
One incident, captured on a cellphone, involved 20-year-old Ronald Weekley Jr., who police officers said was skateboarding on the wrong side of the street in Venice. Weekley refused to stop, so the police tackled him. One officer struck him in the face.
Another video video shows two officers handcuffing a woman and slamming her to the ground after she was pulled over for holding a cellphone while driving. The woman, a San Fernando Valley nurse, suffered bruises to her face and body.
A third incident, which happened in July but only came to light last Thursday, involved the death of a South L.A. woman. On July 22, Alesia Thomas dropped her two children off at the LAPD’s Southeast Area station because she felt her drug addiction rendered her unfit to take care of them. Later that night, officers returned to her house to arrest her on suspicion of child endangerment.
During the arrest, one of the five officers restraining Thomas threatened to kick her in the genitalia if she did not comply, according to the Los Angeles Times. Moments later, the officer made good on her threat, an act that has been confirmed by LAPD Cmdr. Bob Green. Thomas later stopped breathing in the backseat of a patrol car.
These kinds of infractions aren’t foreign to college students. In fact, Weekley was a college student — and he was arrested for something dozens of USC students are reprimanded for.
As college students, a group frequently targeted by law enforcement, and as members of the wider L.A. community, USC students should be wary of emerging reports of LAPD brutality.
Police corruption is not a new problem in Los Angeles. LAPD’s history is one of scandalous incidents, such as the infamous 1991 beating of Rodney King.
Yet the integrity of the LAPD has improved in recent years, such as an internal investigation launched this spring that, for the first time in LAPD history, found that an officer had engaged in racial profiling, according to the Los Angeles Times. The question remains, however, whether LAPD has improved enough. It is a detriment to the university if the community’s police department continues to perpetuate racism, sexism or any other kind of discrimination.
The recent violent altercations caught on video suggest that considerable progress still needs to be made.
While it is unlikely we, as college students, will find ourselves in such scenarios, the behavior of our public servants still affects our well-being. Maybe we won’t get arrested for child endangerment — but what about speeding, jaywalking, noise complaints, trespassing or underage drinking? What about those students who were involved in the Occupy movement — was it just luck that they didn’t end up unjustly pepper-sprayed like the students at UC Davis? A contingent of ’SC students attends the Los Angeles May Day protest every year, which has at times involved police assault on protestors.
A police department that fosters mistrust in the community directly affects USC students. The more police officers break the rules, the more they undermine the improvements they’ve made and the more they reduce their capacity and authority to protect civilians and to fight crime. This holds particularly disastrous implications in areas like USC, where crime rates, and thus the need for protection, are higher.
LAPD might have made considerable progress since the Rodney King beating, but it still has a long way to go. For the time being, college students need to be on their guard to ensure that Angelenos’ rights are respected. That means knowing what police can and cannot lawfully do, speaking out against incidents of police violence and — honestly — staying out of trouble. The police are commissioned to protect us, but sometimes they necessitate we protect ourselves.

More than 1.2 million students drop out of high school every year in the United States, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. A number this startling is indicative of major ills that have infected the American public education system.
Charter schools — schools that receive public funding but do not have to adhere to public regulation — should be seen as a viable solution to the problems that those who are a part of American public education face today. Instead of the bureaucratic regulation that conventional district schools face, charter schools give teachers and administrators the freedom to attack problems in alternative ways while still receiving state and federal funding.
Take USC’s very own Hybrid High, which opened for the first day of classes Tuesday. Hybrid High is a charter school developed by the Rossier School of Education in an effort to reduce the rate of students dropping out of high school in the South L.A. area.
Charter schools are formed when a community applies to the local school district for a charter that allows a school to operate independently from the district. Additionally, charter schools like Hybrid High can be started by organizations and agencies to alleviate strain on existing schools. When a school becomes a charter, it often sees greater student achievement than when it was under district regulation. For example, one-hundred percent of students at the Urban Education Institute in Chicago were accepted to college in 2012, compared to a citywide average of 35 percent.
Hybrid High’s mission is to provide students who would ordinarily drop out of school a place where education is more accessible. Teens in South Los Angeles often come from impoverished families and are therefore required to hold a job to help out. Family, employment and education frequently conflict, and it is common that students in these situations choose to support their family over their own education.
Instead of the traditional 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., Monday through Friday routine seen in most public schools, Hybrid High is open for 12 hours a day, seven days a week and is in session year-round. Additionally, Hybrid High allows students to access coursework online. This creative approach is a bid to provide students who are employed or taking care of siblings the opportunity to complete their education at times convenient for their schedules and at their own pace.
This set-up is impossible under traditional district education, which is the product of a different time. Largely designed in the 1940s, America’s early public schools were engineered to efficiently educate students by applying district-wide standards. It’s clear that what might have worked well in the 1940s does not, though, work today.
Today, the best course of action is to let individual schools choose how to educate their students. Individual schools know exactly what their students need — needs that might not be clear to anyone not immediately connected with the students.
Schools such as Hybrid High are examples of this hyperlocalized approach to education. Rather than continuing to hold schools to obsolete practices, the best course of action for public education is to continue the trend toward implementing charter schools and letting those who are closest to the root of the problems get to work on solving them.

Besides the view of barren wasteland, dying grass and dusty fields, there’s a strange feeling walking into Los Angeles’ FYF Fest. Amongst the clusters of tents, giant sunglasses and the four stages are thousands of Los Angelenos. FYF is a cultural homogenization of everything that is trendy, “in” and L.A. Cue the girls in short floral dresses and high top lace up shoes, the guys with pompadour haircuts and 70s mustaches. When everyone cool, hip and different is packed into one venue – what does that make everyone? The same.
The main problem with FYF, which concluded a two-day run on Sunday, is its blatant stereotyping of L.A.’s character: There was the sense that the festival goers in the Los Angeles State Historic Park were trying too hard. The vapid, mindless fashionistas and frat bros migrated from stage to stage to see the newest, trendiest bands. In essence, everyone at FYF fits in, but few really belong.
That’s where the artists come in. Bands like Father John Misty, Tanlines and The Faint are up-and-comers that have recently been shaping soundtracks to the waning California summer. These movers and shakers made the festival whole.
With a crowd of cookie-cutter undergrads and young adults all sharing similar interests, the life of FYF comes from the individual bands.
Saturday was a powerhouse day for music. As always, smaller bands started off the festival with lackluster crowds and shorter set times. White Arrows, who played at Tommy’s Place last semester, rocked the day into motion with bangers like the ambient “Roll Forever.”
From half past noon until midnight, the park shook with music from the four performance stages. Perhaps a drawback of the venue is that the park is so small that sound from each stage pours into the next—softer acts get drowned out while louder ones rule the airwaves.
A major victim to the festival’s layout was newcomer James Blake who had the standout performance of the weekend. Next to Blake’s set at the Spring St. Stage, Tanlines – a duo that has rightfully blasted onto the music scene – drew grooving crowds with their dance-ready chill-wave beats and vocals. The dance craze in the tent where Tanlines played permeated throughout the eastern venue and muddled much of Blake’s set.
How, then, could Blake have the stand out performance at FYF? Blake’s signature harmonic pitch-corrected vocals drifted in and out of comprehension – at times it was hard to distinguish the roar of the crowd from Blake’s own musical creations.
But the audience was completely entranced by his futuristic sound. The jazzy blues of Blake’s new wave “I Never Learnt to Share” were hauntingly beautiful and immersive. The three-person band was able to recreate Blake’s catalogue with such simplicity and ease that the performance almost looked too easy.
When fans weren’t occupied with Blake, or the captivating light show at M83, or watching the lead singer of Chairlift storm off stage ten minutes before the act was supposed to end (that’s right, they didn’t even play that song from the Apple commercial!), vendor tents and food trucks were all the rage. Various clothing outlets such as Vintage Redeux and Yellow 108 and record stores including Amoeba Music and LA Record sold intriguing merchandise at affordable prices. Social justice-oriented non-profits such as Oxfam and EQCA completed the tent city.
Day two brought about more exciting acts. Dinosaur Jr. put on a riotous performance. A mosh pit and consequent dust storm should have come as no surprise.
Father John Misty proclaimed to the world just how drunk he was, and Aesop Rock brought a fan on stage to get his hair cut during “Racing Stripes.”
Yeasayer and Beirut attracted monstrous crowds where the temperature from shared body heat matched that of the burning afternoon sun.
These musicians and moments make FYF a great last hurrah for the summertime. The festival also makes for a great weekend of mustaches, headbands, button-making, boxed water drinking, bro tanks, t-shirt printing… the list goes on. Since FYF is as trendy as LA itself, be sure to expect a whole new experience next year.
Most unlikely to pump up the bass: Beirut
Best at drawing in a crowd: Tanlines
Best of show: James Blake
Most likely to have a monster introduce the band: M83
Angriest: Chairlift
Most inebriated: Father John Misty
Most diverse crowd: Aesop Rock
Best find: AA Bondy
Sounds better than their record: Sleigh Bells
Looks the most like Gandalf: Dinosaur Jr.
Major drawback: The heat
Minor drawback: The dust
Best food: Schmuck Truck NY Delicatessen on Wheels

With a slew of remakes and sequels dominating theaters, modern cinema is seemingly devoid of originality.
Many films could escape this fate, but they lack the creative drive necessary for a unique voice — they lack auteurship.
The auteur theory suggests that a film’s originality, in large part, stems from the director, the driving creative force behind a film, giving the work a specific style that makes it distinct and easily identifiable. In essence, the auteur theory suggests that the director holds the key to the overall creative vision of a work, bringing the film a specific artistic identity.
When audiences see little more than reboots and adaptations, they can’t help but wonder if auteurship is alive and well or if today’s cinema will forever be condemned to the modern day directorial vision where Bill Condon (The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Parts 1 and 2) rules supreme.
Auteurship is still an active presence in today’s world of cinema, but it is indeed in a state of crisis. Many of the most popular filmmakers struggle to strike a balance between films that have little more to offer than extreme action and special effects — or, dare I say it, Channing Tatum in the lead role — and works that are artistic simply for the sake of being different.
Take Michael Bay for instance: Bay’s films are recognizable on the basis of their impressive special effects and editing, but what do his films really have to say beyond that? The Transformers trilogy and the Bad Boys films clearly have Bay’s stamp on them, but he can hardly be considered an auteur simply because his works are identifiable.
Auteurship is about creating specific artistic identity and carrying that identity through one’s films to convey meaning, something beyond showing off the talents of your effects team.
Mind you, this is not to rag on action films. Paul Greengrass created a specific niche for himself as a director with The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, providing a refreshing take on the chase thriller, with their dark aesthetic and heightened sense of corruption.
But Tony Gilroy simply regurgitated much of the same with this summer’s The Bourne Legacy, offering little more than a tired take on the action-adventure series rather than lending his own vision to the film.
On the other end of the spectrum, there are directors who try to say too much and could afford to back off their excessive use of style — cue Terrence Malick, Tim Burton and Quentin Tarantino. Many of these directors use style as a tool to create their individual aesthetic, but when taken too far, their strong, style-obsessed vision can actually weigh their films down in the process, making viewers wonder how much is too much.
Specifically, Malick was scrutinized for the ambiguous message that was muddled between the beautiful cinematography of last summer’s Tree of Life. Meanwhile, Burton has proven his cinematic style to be a one-trick pony limited to a quirky yet gothic palette, and  — it pains me to say this — Tarantino is often just a mere pastiche of previous, outlandish, stylistic works.
To their credit, Malick’s film was well received at film festivals, such as Cannes, Burton has his own niche following and Tarantino has accrued attention for his standout screenwriting. And though their messages can get lost in translation, these directors are at the very least trying to convey a personal sense of style.
But what filmgoers really need is a happy medium between the “too much” and “not enough” scenarios that populate today’s film scene. They need films that provoke thought and use style as a means of enhancement and not just for the purpose of grabbing attention. Simply put, filmgoers need more Alexander Paynes, Christopher Nolans and Alfred Hitchcocks.
Spike Lee and David Cronenberg, whose Red Hook Summer and Cosmopolis, respectively, are currently in theaters, serve as prime examples of auteurship’s potential to flourish. It isn’t all bad news people — these are directors with a personal sense of style and message they want to express.
Lee’s work typically reflects vibrant, urban life, while Cronenberg is known as an originator of dystopian horror. Both of their films are just starting their runs in theaters, and although they have both received mediocre reviews, they clearly represent a unique point of view, an individual aesthetic.
It’s too soon to tell how these films rank on the auteur theory scale as both films are just beginning their expansion, but at the very least they have something to say, a specific style to express, and that’s exactly what modern films need to continue to do.
I admit the pleasures of a mindless thriller like Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and I was a big fan of Tree of Life and other art house films, although I recognize their excessive use of style. But it is not enough to settle for the extreme ends of the spectrum.
A balance must be struck between marketability and outlandishly artsy cinema, and that starts with a unique yet poignant creative vision — it starts with auteurship.

Ari Graynor made her debut as a leading actress in For a Good Time, Call… last Friday, finally graduating from her role as the scene-stealing sidekick.
Call is a feel-good summer flick with a fun, albeit predictable, plot. Graynor plays Katie, a “sexercising” free spirit who’s facing eviction for not paying rent. Then her sassy, gay best friend sets her up with a roommate (Lauren Powell) —  who, of course, is the frenemy she made one drunken night in college. The raunchy jokes really begin when the film reveals that Katie is a phone-sex operator. The roommates’ friendship blossoms as they start their own phone-sex business.
When watching the film, it’s important to remember that this is Graynor’s first leading role, so she might have been unprepared for the larger part in Call. Much like her co-star, Graynor fails to give her character the three-dimensionality the audience craves. But, in her defense, the differences between supporting and main characters are significant enough to make her proficient at one but a novice at the other.
Supporting characters are usually the reliable friends or parents. They purposefully remain undeveloped, partially in order to keep the focus on the main characters. These secondary roles sometimes serve either as the voice of reason or as the supplement to the main character’s own conscience. In other cases, their entire purpose is to provide comedy in a film’s darker or duller moments. In an otherwise dramatic film, this allows the audience to take a breather from the heavy emotions and thick tensions.
Secondary roles are usually limited to one set of emotions, reactions and opinions: The characters remain constant throughout the arc of the story. Though two-dimensional, the role of the secondary character  is absolutely necessary.
Graynor excels in portraying these secondary roles, namely in Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist and Celeste and Jesse Forever.
As Caroline in Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist, Graynor is a hot mess, like a burnt burrito exploding with beans and cheese from the microwave. She gets drunk, she gets lost, she gets kidnapped and she steals a turkey sandwich.
Graynor is responsible for initiating the wacky plot and propelling it further as she stumbles through the film’s universe. She perfectly portrays the troublesome comedic relief, a one-sided role that, though small, impacts the entire movie. Without her antics, Nick and Norah would never bond as they search for their lost friend.
The day to Caroline’s night, Graynor’s Beth in Celeste and Jesse Forever is the best friend that forces reason back into Celeste’s emotionally turbulent life. Beth makes her friend face the reality of her relationship with Jesse, opening Celeste’s eyes to the tough decisions she has to make in order to move on with her life.
As Celeste’s life begins to fall apart, Beth is a constant force that keeps her afloat. Graynor is an exemplary foil, a fun house mirror that shows how Celeste’s life could have turned out had she acted maturely and thought through her actions. Again, Graynor plays her role with perfect consistency, the best way to depict a flat character.
Strong main characters are required to be three-dimensional with varying and contradicting opinions and feelings, internal conflicts and personal quirks. It is not enough for them to have reactions or emotions in accordance to the world around them — they must be their own moving force, a power not only affected but effective. A protagonist can stand alone, causing conflict and resolving it in one fell swoop. Most importantly, a protagonist must change as plot develops. The change might be as obvious as a complete reversal in life philosophy or as subtle as self-realization.
For these reasons, acting in a dynamic role is a much greater challenge than playing a one-dimensional character. The actor must completely understand the persona by mastering the depiction of the nuances, tics and habits that are the character.
In Call, Graynor attempts her first leading role as Katie. Through dialog and set actions, the character has all the qualities needed to be three-dimensional. Though she ultimately doesn’t change much, Katie does undergo a subtle transformation as the movie progresses.
Possibly from lack of experience, Graynor plays Katie in such a way that this change barely registers emotionally with the audience. She seems capable of only three emotions throughout the film: angry, happy and nervous. She fails to portray any subtleties of her character, showing only bigger, obvious emotions — Graynor reacts but doesn’t really act.
This worked well in her other roles simply because they required this bare minimum in order to not overshadow the main cast.
Graynor’s reacting instead of acting is most notable when Katie is by herself. When left alone, Graynor doesn’t portray any mental connections with her character. She is, in a manner of speaking, intellectually dead unless she is reacting to someone else. And even then, there are times when her responses are a bit dull.
In a pivotal scene when Katie and Lauren inevitably bond, Graynor’s eyes portray no passing emotions, no change in thought. This is the moment when the women finally connect, and though her face isn’t blank, it doesn’t emote any complexities.
Furthermore, though Graynor seemed to alter her voice to emotions with ease in her other roles, in Call, she often failed to match her sound to the events at hand. Graynor excelled with sarcastic remarks and annoyance, but when it came to more serious feelings, such as love, her hoarse voice rose in pitch and began to sound insincere. Coupled with limited facial expressions, it made for a mediocre performance.
Thrust too early into a lead role, Graynor falls short of what audiences need from a leading lady. Nevertheless, because it’s her first dip into the pool of main characters, she shouldn’t be judged too harshly. Given her firm grasp of supporting roles, hope remains that with enough practice the name Ari Graynor will one day be synonymous with leading lady.

Opening to loud howls of excitement, “All Hail A Cappella” kick-started the a cappella season Monday night in Bovard Auditorium.
The concert showcases USC’s eight a cappella groups and is held every year to attract new members.
Glee, who? · Reverse Osmosis, one of USC’s many a cappella groups, took the stage at Bovard with their perfected musicality and choreography. Other performance groups included The Sirens and The SoCal VoCals. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Both cultural and musical  diversity among the groups made for a spectacular show. Asli Baat, for example, focuses on Bollywood-English fusion while Overflow sings Christian tunes. Others tend to lean on more popular genres, such as pop and alternative: Khoir Practice sang a version of Adele’s “Rolling in the Deep” and Reverse Osmosis performed its take on Coldplay’s “Every Teardrop is a Waterfall.”
“It’s not just about singing when it comes to a cappella. It’s also about theatrics, synchronized movement and expression through the music,” said Shefali Deshpande, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law and a member of Asli Baat.
“All Hail” made this consistently clear: The performances were often as impressive visually as they were vocally. Most of the groups had choreography to match the feel and tempo of their songs.
The most notable performances came from the older, more established groups, namely SoCal VoCals and Troy Tones. The former is the three-time reigning champ at the International Championships of Collegiate A Cappella, and members have been featured on the Today Show as well as The Sing-Off. Troy Tones celebrates its 10th anniversary this year, nodding at the milestone with an outstanding opening rendition of “Circle of Life.”
In a very creative way, “All Hail” marks the beginning of the a cappella audition process. The performances demonstrate the many factors a cappella groups will be considering as they accept new members.
First-round auditions began Tuesday night in Taper Hall and will continue through Wednesday. Those trying out will be asked to sing a piece of their choice. Some additional requirements include singing scales, sightreading and displaying aural memory.
Though these groups formed as fun, extracurricular activities, they do not take their work lightly. The audition process can be tense for the groups as well.
“There is a little competition, especially since many times we are competing to get the same singers to join our group,” said SoCal VoCal’s Richard Mattox, a sophomore majoring in narrative studies. “But for the most part all members of all groups are incredibly supportive and friendly with all the other groups.”
Inter-group drama needs to be put by the wayside as well. Even a solid group of musically savvy singers must constantly work on their skills, mastering their own parts but also matching the tones of their teammates.
“The challenge of singing a cappella is it is so easy to sound bad,” said Kevin Rutkowski, a senior majoring in theatre and political science and president of the Trojan Men. “If one person is off pitch, you can tell. If the background is too loud, people get disappointed when you can’t hear the soloist.”
Those auditioning should be able to blend with other voices. Most groups look for this skill in their prospective singers.
The best performances Monday were delivered not only by the most talented, but also by the most practiced and skilled groups of singers. Nevertheless, many of the necessary abilities are learnable, so most groups do not look for previous training during the audition process.
Fortunately, with the varied mix of groups, students can find those best suited for their interests. There are even ways for non-group members to immerse themselves in the a cappella world.
If there isn’t a concert, groups host parties. If there is a concert, there’s an after party. Fans are encouraged to attend everything.
If those events are any bit as rousing as Bovard on Monday night, you’ll likely find it worth surrounding yourself in the vocal harmonies of these groups, no matter what.
Just for your edification, that’s us there in the photo, not the SoCal VoCals.

I thought, after USC’s 49-10 blowout of Hawai’i in which sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee took the first play of the entire season for a touchdown, you would all start booking flights to Miami and talking about how you couldn’t wait to beat down Alabama.
I was all set to write a column more or less about how everybody needed to calm down. I was going to write about how the 2004 Trojans are the only preseason Associated Press No. 1 team to actually win the BCS Championship since 2000, and how only four teams have done it in the last 30 years. A mere 10 teams have done it since the Associated Press started preseason rankings in 1950.
I was going to say that there is a lot of season left, a lot of football to be played, a lot of traps to be avoided. I was going to remind everyone that USC beat Hawai’i, not Alabama nor Oregon nor even Utah. I thought people would need a reminder that USC played just one game, against perhaps its worst opponent of the season, and that there were still 13 to go to get to Miami or Pasadena.
And, to my surprise, fans agreed with the sentiment.
I have had so many conversations with delusional people who claim there is “no way” the Trojans won’t win it all. The “BCS title or bust” mentality I have felt from many on this campus is ludicrous. I was afraid people legitimately expect that out of this team.
Does the team have a chance? Of course, and a pretty good one.
Is it something they should be expected to do? Never.
“One down, 13 to go” is the perfect moniker for the grind that is a college football season. There is almost no room for error: chances are, one loss will derail USC’s championship aspirations. One injury, one bad call, potentially even one missed tackle and it can all come crashing down.
So, Trojan fans, thank you for not getting caught up in the hype — too much, that is. Some of it is legitimate. Lee’s touchdown is a sign if there ever was one.
Honestly, it’s perfectly fine to salivate over a colossal showdown of undefeated teams when Oregon visits the Coliseum on Nov. 3. And go ahead and dream of an unstoppable-force-meets-immovable-object championship game of USC and Alabama in South Beach. But remember that, for now, that’s what these matchups are: dreams.
In high school, my basketball coach would ask us the same question before every game: “Why is this game the most important game of the season?”
We gave the following answer every time: “Because it’s the next one on the schedule.”
Ask anyone on this Trojan football team this week about any opponent besides Syracuse, and he will tell you his focus is entirely on the game ahead. I was worried Trojan fans were going to forget the simple fact that it won’t matter what happens in November or January if USC missteps against a lesser opponent before that time. But after the game on Saturday, I saw fans posting the team’s “prep not hype” motto on Facebook and Twitter. Those words are painted on the grass at the entrance to Howard Jones Field. The team sees them as they enter practice every day. Trojan fans are wise to remember those words this year as the hype grows and the preparation becomes all the more important.

The Associated Press top-25 poll showed a change atop the rankings on Tuesday, as Alabama seized the No. 1 spot from USC after throttling then-No. 8 Michigan, 41-14.
Step back · Senior quarterback Matt Barkley is taking the Trojans’ drop in the AP poll in stride, insisting No. 1 Alabama “is a great team.” – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The Wolverines dropped 11 spots to No. 19, and Oregon moved up from No. 5 to No. 4.
Though USC, which fell to No. 2, handled its business with a 39-point win against Hawai’i, the adjusted rankings did not come as a surprise to players or coaches.
“I would agree with [the updated rankings],” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “[Alabama] played a really good Michigan team in a big matchup, and they played really well.”
Senior quarterback Matt Barkley also spoke about USC dropping to No. 2 in the poll.
“I don’t care about it,” Barkley said. “It really doesn’t motivate me. I know Alabama is a great team.”
Kiffin diverted attention back to Saturday’s matchup against Syracuse, stressing that the Trojans cannot take this game lightly.
“This is our second game together,” Kiffin said. “We got to make sure that our guys don’t think that they’re better than they are just because they were ahead 35-0 at halftime. We’re going on the road to a place we’ve never been before against a very good team.”
Kiffin proceeded to praise a Syracuse offense — led by veteran quarterback Ryan Nassib — that posted 41 points against Northwestern.
“[Syracuse] is a lot better on defense than a year ago and extremely explosive on offense, and they lead the country in passing yards,” Kiffin said. “We gave up more yards than we should have to Hawai’i to a quarterback we hadn’t played. [Syracuse] has a quarterback setting school records, so it’s a huge challenge this week.”
USC needs to improve a run offense that amassed just 81 yards against Hawai’i. Syracuse gave up 124 yards rushing against Northwestern last weekend, but only allowed 3.1 yards per carry in the process.
“We need to play better up front, and we had a couple holes that we were a little late on, so we need to coach better, too,” Kiffin said.
—
Sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee addressed his Heisman Trophy buzz after a dazzling performance against Hawai’i. He had 297 all-purpose yards in the contest to go with two touchdowns.
“[I’m] not really worried about the hype and all of the accolades that come with it,” Lee said when asked about the prestigous award. “But I do appreciate what people say, and I’m going to continue to work hard.”

Entering last Saturday’s game against Hawai’i, USC fielded a starting defensive line with three players earning their first career starts. The fourth player, sophomore defensive tackle George Uko, despite forcing two fumbles and registering 1.5 sacks in 2011, only had two career starts to his name.
Young guns · USC used young defensive linemen against Hawai’i on Saturday including sophomore defensive tackle George Uko (90), redshirt freshman Antwaun Woods (99) and junior college transfer Morgan Breslin (91). – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The depth behind them was even more tenuous, with three freshmen and junior defensive end Kevin Greene comprising the second rotation.
No one quite knew how five of the eight defensive linemen making their USC debuts would fare and many anticipated prolonged growing pains, much like the Trojans experienced last season when introducing three new starters to their offensive line.
“There were a lot of question marks [on the defensive line] coming in,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “It seems like they made a bunch of plays up front. The defensive linemen that played [Saturday] were a lot different than last year.”
USC’s defensive linemen performed well Saturday in its 49-10 win, combining for four of the team’s five sacks and rendering Hawai’i quarterback Sean Schroeder’s passing pocket virtually non-existent for most of the game.
“The whole [defensive line] got pressure, especially up the middle,” sophomore J.R. Tavai said, who converted from nose tackle to defensive end early in fall camp because of depth concerns at the position.
After playing in seven games at defensive tackle last season, Tavai, who recorded three tackles against Hawai’i, has found the transition to defensive end challenging, but more suited to his strengths and 260-pound frame.
“Rushing and more one-on-one [battles have been the biggest adjustments],” Tavai said. “There’s more responsibility to get to the quarterback.”
Senior defensive ends Wes Horton and Devon Kennard were slated to wreak havoc on opposing offensive tackles this fall, but Kennard tore his pectoral muscle lifting weights in July and Horton only participated in fall camp sparingly while rehabilitating for an undisclosed injury. Though Kiffin is not providing a timetable for Horton’s return, the general sentiment is that it’s not something that will sideline him long-term.
With their absences and the departures of defensive end Nick Perry and defensive tackles Christian Tupou and DaJohn Harris to the NFL, USC needs some of its younger talent to mature and contribute immediately.
Last Saturday, two newcomers  in particular flashed disruptive capability along the line: freshman defensive tackle Leonard Williams and junior defensive end Morgan Breslin.
Perhaps the defensive highlight of the night occurred when sophomore linebacker Hayes Pullard intercepted a pass and returned it for a 27-yard touchdown.
A closer review of the play revealed that Williams, a native of Daytona Beach, Fla., hit Schroeder during his follow-through to force the errant throw. Not merely satisfied with the interception, Williams continued the play and bulldozed a path for Pullard to follow into the end zone, finishing with a punishing block on a Warrior defender.
The 6-foot-5, 270-pound defensive lineman also recovered a fumble, registered a sack and broke up a pass.  Defensive line coach Ed Orgeron compared the freshman to former star defensive tackle Shaun Cody in fall camp.
“The [defensive line] really stepped it up today,” Williams said. “I had a really good time playing with them.”
Not to be outdone, Breslin was often in the Hawai’i backfield pressuring Schroeder. He finished with five tackles — an impressive total for a defensive end — and one sack for a loss of two yards. Those figures fail to capture, however, the sheer number of times Breslin hurried the quarterback and forced off-balance throws.
“I was very proud of those guys,” Kiffin said. “I have to look at the film [to describe their play in more detail], but [Breslin] and [Williams] really flashed.”
USC’s young defensive line must create similar penetration against better future competition and still hold up against the run — the team gave up only 1.75 yards per rush against Hawai’i. If the Trojans can produce similar performances, the team defense might be the best it’s been since 2009, the last year USC won the Rose Bowl, which was a 38-24 victory over Penn State.
For now, the young defensive linemen are hoping their play will soon inspire more outside confidence in the unit.
“A lot of people, they look down on us, like they aren’t really encouraged about us,” Williams said. “We just have to get ready for the next game.”

USC put its best foot forward this past weekend at the UCLA Invitational, winning all three of its games in blowout fashion. In what was to be expected, the team had no trouble with opponents La Verne, Pomona-Pitzer, and Chapman, scoring 20 goals or more in each contest and allowing a combined total of just ten goals. Head coach Jovan Vavic was pleased with the trajectory of the team coming off the season’s first set of games.
“Overall I feel that we are getting better,” Vavic said. “Our guys were playing with more poise and intensity as the tournament went on. Our defense I felt was the best of all the teams in the tournament.”
One bright spot over the weekend was the official return of team captain Matt Burton, who missed most of last season due to injury. The fifth-year senior scored two goals over the weekend in his first game after a long recovery.
“It’s just great. It reminds me of the whole reason I wanted to play water polo,” Burton said. “Just to be there for my teammates, after coming back from injury. It’s come full circle and I couldn’t be more excited to be back in the pool.”
Redshirt sophomore goalie Ely Bonilla got the bulk of the playing time while junior goalie James Clarke rested a sore knee. Vavic praised Bonilla’s play, but would not comment on who would be the starter. In fact, the team may use both goalies equally for specific situations.
“Ely is a fabulous goalie, but we have two top-caliber goalies,” Burton sad. “We’re looking at possibly having two goalies that we can both utilize in certain situations against certain teams.”
Offensively, the standout of the tournament was junior driver Nikola Vavic. The second-leading goal scorer from a year ago, Vavic scored 10 goals combined over the three victories.
“Nikola had a really excellent tournament,” Vavic said. “He really was playing the best water polo he has played at USC.”
In addition to the three official games, the Men of Troy played in three scrimmages, which gave Vavic a chance to play younger, more inexperienced players.
“Some of our younger players who didn’t play a lot last year, they all played and contributed,” Vavic said. “And that’s the best thing. We now know that we have an extra five or six guys that can help us in big games.”
While the team clearly had no trouble scoring, coach Vavic still found areas for improvement for the team moving forward.
“We have to be more patient on offense and a little bit smarter with our decision making,” Vavic said. “We still made very naïve mistakes, but I attribute that to being tired. We played four games on Sunday, so they were just exhausted.”
The Men of Troy will have plenty of time to rest up, as their next game is Saturday against Cal Baptist in the team’s home opener.

USC suffered two heartbreaking comeback losses this weekend to Duke and San Diego, extending their losing streak to three games after starting the season with two victories.
The 2-1 loss against the Toreros (3-3-0) on Sunday shocked and disappointed USC coach Ali Khosroshahin, who expected a better effort from his squad after a promising performance against No. 4 Duke (6-1-0) on Friday.
“We needed to do better,” Khosroshahin said. “Duke is a top-5 program, and [San Diego] is a team that is battling to survive like we are.”
The Women of Troy, who have focused on “winning the first five minutes” of each match this season, came out of the gates strong against the Toreros.
In the eighth minute, junior midfielder Jordan Marada took a long shot from the left corner of the box that ricocheted in off the right post and into the net to put the Women of Troy up 1-0.
USC would receive another golden opportunity to score just a few minutes later when the Toreros committed a handball in the box. In response San Diego keeper McKenna Tollack made one of her seven saves on the ensuing penalty kick, guessing correctly on senior Samantha Johnson’s attempt to keep her team’s deficit at one goal.
In the 22nd minute, San Diego’s Sierra Ferreira found the equalizer on a centering pass deep in USC territory.
The score held at 1-1 until the 70th minute, when the Toreros closely replicated their first goal on a boot by Mariah Butera.
USC desperately tried to break through again, but despite outshooting San Diego 21-8, the Women of Troy failed to find the back of the net before time ran out.
“We made some mental errors,” said goalie Caroline Stanley. “We feel disappointed today because we feel like we had it in our grasp and we kind of let it go.”
The Women of Troy (2-3-0) followed a similar script against the Blue Devils on Friday, scoring an early goal before surrendering two scores in the second half.
In the sixth minute, Marada blasted a corner kick into the box that found the foot of sophomore midfielder Alex Quincey, who tapped it in for a 1-0 lead against the top-ranked opponent USC had faced this season.
The Women of Troy kept the lead through halftime, but the Blue Devils picked up the offensive pressure as soon as the second half began.
In the 63rd minute, Laura Weinberg sent in a cross from the left side that Kim DeCesare knocked in to tie it up.
Duke rallied for the go-ahead goal just moments later in the 70th minute. Weinberg sent in a corner kick to Gilda Doria at the near post, who flicked a header back to the far post that DeCesare netted for her second goal of the day.
Duke goalie Tara Campbell made three big saves in the waning moments that clinched it for the Blue Devils.
Despite disappointing losses they suffered this weekend, the Women of Troy are said they staying positive and viewing the setbacks as bumps in the road that young teams have to experience.
“I think we started the game really well,” said junior defender Elizabeth Eddy. “Going forward, we just need to maintain that high energy throughout the second half.”
“We’ve faced a lot of adversity, and it’s going to get easier,” Stanley said. “We have to remember that obstacles are stepping stones and not stumbling blocks.”
The Women of Troy return to action next Sunday on the road against Cal-State Northridge (3-1-1).
our Team has a ton of Talent!!! We start early and often, great flow, ball movement, possession, etc.
Its a Blessing to score 1st while playing so well…..then it gets difficult for a fan to watch the Blue Devils and Toreros
comeback and win.
I Love this team.  We can go far. Just needs a little tweaking and a little more familiarity among the players.
We have a super talented and super young team. I BELIEVE IN COACH ALI!!!
ALI can take us to the promised land if the players develop, and continue to grow as a team.
DUKE is a preseason #2 ranked squad.
USD has had our number the past few yrs, not a bad program at all.

A new multidisciplinary minor in the health sciences this fall will allow students in the Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Science to take classes at the Keck School of Medicine.
The health science minor is intended to give students an overview of the broad spectrum of work within the health care profession today. In addition to core science classes in biology and chemistry, the minor includes classes rooted in contemporary issues in health care, such as legal and business issues, as well as classes on specific types of medical practice.
“This program sets a new standard for pre-medical undergraduate education,” Carmen A. Puliafito, dean of the Keck School, said in a press release. “The faculty at the Keck School is looking forward to welcoming our first undergraduate students and also to working side-by-side with our colleagues on the University Park Campus.”
The goal of the health science minor is to utilize the resources of both Dornsife College and the Keck School to give students a comprehensive overview of what it is like to be working in health care today.
Stuart Swadron, assistant dean of pre-health undergraduate studies at the Keck School, said the minor was created to help those who want to enter health care with a well-rounded view of complex issues in medicine.
“The modern doctor needs more than a medical degree,” Swadron said in a press release. “Students are going to need to have a broader understanding of how health care fits into the bigger picture.”
Looks like a good program!  Health care is very important and we need to educate our future.

College review website Unigo ranked USC third on its list of Top 10 Colleges for Aspiring Entrepreneurs, the Huffington Post reported Saturday.
More than 30,000 college students voted on top schools for entrepreneurs on the site. The University of Oklahoma and the University of Pennsylvania beat out USC for the top two spots.
U.S. News and World Report previously ranked USC third on its list of top entrepreneurship college as well.
