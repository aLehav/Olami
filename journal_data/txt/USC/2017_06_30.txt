Highly touted forward Taeshon Cherry committed to USC on Friday, continuing head coach Andy Enfield’s impressive recruiting campaign the last few seasons. ESPN ranks him as a five-star recruit.

Cherry, who averaged 20 points and 10 rebounds a game at St. Augustine High School in San Diego, is the highest-ranked recruit in the Enfield era. The last time USC basketball snagged a recruit as coveted as Cherry was 2007 when current Toronto Raptors forward DeMar DeRozan committed to the University. 
He is the second power forward to commit to USC just this week following four-star recruit J’Raan Brooks’ announcement on Monday.
Cherry, a 6-foot-8 San Diego native, turned down Arizona, Gonzaga and Texas A&M in favor of USC.
“My relationship with coach Tony [Bland] and Coach Enfield was better than all the other schools,” Cherry told ESPN. “Their style of play fits my style of play. Our matchup was meant to be.”
Cherry’s scouting report on Scout.com describes him as a versatile forward who can shoot from distance, rebound the ball and handle the ball on the fastbreak. He lends similarities to junior forward Bennie Boatwright, and may be a potential replacement if Boatwright forgoes his senior season.
Enfield will have one of the most talented rosters in the country next year with all five of his starters returning. Since his hiring in 2013, USC basketball has risen in the ranks. Last season, led by power forwards Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu, the team won 26 games — its most in a single season — and advanced to the Round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament. 
Cherry’s recruitment is especially important to Enfield because many of USC’s key players next season are expected to declare for the draft, with Jordan McLaughlin and Elijah Stewart as seniors and juniors Boatwright and Chimezie Metu talented enough to be on the NBA radar.
But for now, Cherry joins a deep team that is projected to be ranked in the top 15 nationwide in preseason polls. In March, prior to the NCAA Tournament, Enfield talked to the Daily Trojan about what he expected next season.
“If this team stays together with our recruits coming in next year … we think it’s a special team now, but with another year of experience, you can project everyone coming back,” Enfield said. “I think this program’s headed in the right direction.”

William Goodeve, a rising senior majoring in cinema and media studies, was reported missing to the Los Angeles Police Department on June 25 after reportedly failing to return to his off-campus apartment for 36 hours and exhibiting unusual behavior. 
According to a news release published on the Los Angeles Police Department website on June 29, Goodeve was last seen on June 23 in the 2300 block of Scarff Street in Los Angeles. He is described as a 20-year-old white male with brown hair and brown eyes, and is believed to be wearing blue jeans and a blue button-up shirt without his glasses, shoes nor bag. He is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs approximately 155 pounds. 
Goodeve’s roommate Dan Giles, a rising junior and media arts and practice major, said Goodeve had been away from the apartment for extended periods of time for about a week. Some of Goodeve’s friends from the Caruso Catholic Center also voiced concerns regarding Goodeve’s unusual behavior and stopped by his apartment, located approximately a mile from campus, according to Giles.
Giles said he last saw Goodeve when he briefly returned to the apartment on June 22, causing his apartment mates to call the Department of Public Safety. 
Goodeve’s mother Jane Goodeve filed a missing persons report with the LAPD on June 25 and has been working closely with the police ever since. She has also been calling local hospitals, homeless shelters and Catholic churches for any information, according to Giles. 
Giles said William Goodeve has been sighted multiple times by homeless shelter volunteers in Santa Monica and downtown L.A., and is believed to be gravitating toward public spaces and approaching people to tell them about God. 
According to the LAPD website, police are normally given a very limited role while conducting missing persons investigations, as all people have “a right to be left alone.” However, if a missing person is considered “endangered,” due to medical problems or life-threatening situations, police will take appropriate investigative measures. Once a missing person is found, police will only notify the person who initially filed the report. Police cannot disclose the location or whereabouts of the missing person without his or her consent.
In addition to the LAPD investigation, Giles has been using social media to try and gather information about Goodeve’s whereabouts, by creating Reddit threads and posting on Facebook, including a student meme page run by USC students. 
Anyone who has seen William Goodeve or has any information regarding his location can call LAPD’s Missing Persons Unit at (213) 996-1800. 
This is a developing story and will be updated.

Drugs.
This news is especially disturbing to me, given that I knew Will for a short time while we participated in USC’s Explore LA trip to Pasadena in my first semester in USC. Really hope that he is found soon and all help be given to him.
Could it be he recently met a new friend that got him hooked on drugs??
This just happened to another friend of a friend, almost identical behavior and location. He was eventually recognized and taken to USC County Hospital where friends caught up with him. There’s a Facebook page called DTLA Town Square: the downtown folks on it were INSTRUMENTAL in finding that fiend. Seek them out.
You mean friend?
