The USC baseball team is hoping to stay undefeated on the season tonight against the University of Kentucky Wildcats. The Trojans (4-0) built upon a three-game sweep last weekend against Towson University by beating No. 25 Cal State Fullerton on the road Tuesday night, 6-4.
Junior outfielder David Oppenheim got the offense started against Fullerton with a solo home run in the second inning. However, senior catcher Garrett Stubbs paced the offense for the Trojans, going 2-for-5 with three RBI and a run scored.
Freshman Mason Perryman threw four innings and gave up two runs on six hits while striking out two and walking two in his first career collegiate start.
The Trojans used three relievers to finish off the game. Sophomore Bernardo Flores got the win after throwing three innings of two-run ball. Junior Marc Huberman struck out the side in a scoreless eighth inning and fellow junior Kyle Davis recorded his second save of the season after striking out two in a perfect ninth inning.
Coming off their fourth- straight win, the Trojans will face the University of Kentucky Wildcats (2-0) tonight at Dedeaux Field. Junior pitcher Tyler Gilbert will make his second start of the season.
USC head coach Dan Hubbs said he’s excited with the success his team has had so far, especially after going on the road to beat a talented Fullerton team. However, he stressed that the Trojans cannot get caught up in their recent success and must maintain focus throughout the entire season.
“I think the biggest thing is we went into Fullerton and won,” Hubbs said. “It was a good test for our guys, the first road test at a good program and a great atmosphere, and we won a tough game. I’m excited about the 4-0 start but it doesn’t mean anything if we don’t keep winning.”
The Trojans get their next chance to extend their four-game winning streak tonight, but they face a big challenge against a talented Kentucky team. The Wildcats qualified for the NCAA Regionals last season with a 37-25 overall record, marking the     sixth-most wins in Kentucky history.
This season, the Wildcats have come out strong again with impressive 11-7 and 10-1 victories against Ball State University and the University of Richmond, respectively.
However, successful programs such as Kentucky do not intimidate the Trojans, as Hubbs believes they approach every opponent the same way.
“We’re playing the game — not the opponent,” Hubbs said. “If we play well, we know we’re going to be in every game, and that’s really the focus. I can’t worry about whether we’re playing Kentucky or Fullerton or whoever we’re playing. We just have to be the best team on the field that day.”
The Trojans have benefitted from early success on both sides of the ball this season, pitching to a 2.50 ERA and hitting for a .307 average as a team through four games. However, the Wildcats have featured dominant            early-season pitching and hitting as well, batting .368 and limiting opponents to a 2.50 ERA as a team through two games.
Senior second baseman Dante Flores says USC has to stick to playing fundamental baseball in order to beat Kentucky.
“Our pitchers have to throw strikes and let our defense make plays behind them,” Flores said. “Our hitters have to move the runners, score the runner from third base and just do the little things. Play the little game of baseball I don’t think we should run into any problems [against Kentucky].”
Coming off the big win against Fullerton and a strong season last spring, the Trojans view this season as an opportunity to prove themselves as an elite ball club. With strong playoff aspirations this season, Hubbs believes the team must capitalize on every opportunity in order to win.
“We have to win those close games and we have to beat teams that we’re supposed to beat,” Hubbs said. “We can’t give any games away.”
The confidence surrounding  the Trojans is palpable, and Flores sent out a warning to the rest of the conference that the Trojans are a force to be reckoned with.
“I think we can win the [Pac-12] and be a contender for regionals, Flores said. “We feel like we’re going to contend this year and surprise a lot of people.

I think that many can agree that the journey from boyhood to manhood isn’t an easy one, especially because the notion of “manhood” is such a vague and misunderstood one.
Playing sports can be a great vehicle for boys who are making the transition, but it can sometimes prove to be a great downfall.
As someone who grew up playing sports and brought up in what is known as the “locker room environment,” I used to believe that the definition of a “man” was someone with strength, stoutness and athleticism.
It was my high school lacrosse coach, a former pilot for the Navy, who first introduced me to my current view of manhood, which involves being resilient, always maintaining integrity and standing up for the person next to you.
According to one of the many definitions, a man is a person with the qualities often associated with males — qualities such as bravery, spirit and toughness.
It seems that the ability for a man to defend himself and fight is an element that arises from the “machismo culture” of strong masculine pride that surrounds athletics.
For example, take the case of the Miami Dolphins when it became public knowledge that former player Richie Incognito had been bullying the younger Jonathan Martin. Though Incognito would later be reprimanded for his despicable harassment of Martin and condemned by much of the public, Incognito could have been seen as the dominant figure in this instance and Martin was portrayed as “soft,” a trait that no man, especially a professional athlete, wants to be associated with at work.
The “man” in this situation is he who defied universal morals and Kantian ethics, and hurt a fellow human being — a concept that is difficult for many, including myself, to accept.
If this is the case, why would I want to be personified as a man in the first place? This brings up the golden question: what does manhood entail?
I couldn’t think of a more perfect individual to illustrate this journey from boyhood to manhood than the one and only Kobe Bryant, someone I can’t seem to stay away from in my columns — but for good reason.
In 1996, Bryant made the leap straight from high school to the NBA as a 17-year-old and couldn’t even sign off on his own contract with the Lakers — he needed his parents to cosign it.
Having consciously watched Bryant since around the year 2000, when I was 6-years-old and the Lakers won their first of three consecutive national titles, I’ve seen the progression of the five-time NBA champion not only as a player, but as a person.
And, I’ve been able to discover what it truly means to be a man just by watching Bryant’s demeanor and success on and off the basketball court.
When Bryant was younger, he was naive, immature, impulsive and arrogant. Over the years, he has burst out of his cocoon on his way to becoming a leader, coach and mentor for his teammates. Though Bryant still displays the occasional bout of impulsivity, he has, for the most part, become a well-rounded leader who has demonstrated a stretch of personal growth.
Bryant made it clear that he’s not trying to take after anyone else —  namely Michael Jordan. At the end of the day, he’s just being Kobe.
“I know who I am,” Bryant said in a recent interview with GQ magazine.
Bryant recently told Ahmad Rashad in an exclusive interview with NBA TV that he’s just like everyone else when Rashad asked “Who is Kobe Bryant?”
“I’m outgoing, sometimes. I’m private in others. Talkative in some situations. Quiet in some situations. I’m arrogant sometimes, I’m an outgoing person with people that I know,” Bryant said.
That’s when I realized that in order to make that painful succession from boy to man, you just have to be yourself. It’s just that simple.
I couldn’t agree more with the notions that Bryant promotes here, which resonates with legendary UCLA men’s basketball coach John Wooden’s two favorite words in the English language: love and balance. It’s important to be passionate about the things that you do, but it’s just as imperative to make sure that you stay sophisticated and keep everyone on their feet when it comes to communicating with you.
Now, how does this tie back to being a man?
This just goes to show that one doesn’t need to be a tough and intimidating guy or run a Fortune 500 company to be seen as a man. One just has to have a set of morals, ethics and personality traits that you stand by. In other words, you just need to practice what you preach.
I think this idea is actually the toughest for males to grasp, and it takes time like in the case of Bryant, who opted not to go to college so he was faced with the burden of growing up at an exponential rate.
There’s no doubt that the environment of professional sports helps expedite that process.
Many of us, however, are fortunate enough to get at least four additional years to advance our morals and ethics on the way to becoming a man.
Nonetheless, the popular conception of manhood, one that tramples on morals and is prevalent within sports, is a topic worth pondering and conversation worth having.

After breaking their nine-game losing streak, the USC men’s basketball team will look to upset the No. 7 Arizona Wildcats on Thursday night.
Despite losing star freshman Jordan McLaughlin to injury, the Trojans were able to defeat the Oregon State Beavers 68-55. Though the Trojans were missing their assist leader, fellow freshman Elijah Stewart filled in admirably.
Stewart, who came to USC as the Los Angeles City Section player of the year, struggled with consistency in his first year. Thankfully for USC, Stewart had his best game as a Trojan against the Beavers.
“I made that first three and it really gave me [a] confidence boost,” Stewart said. “I felt the stroke and let that rhythm carry me on both ends.”
The former Westchester High standout scored 19 points, including a career high of five three-pointers, to go along with five rebounds, four assists, three steals and three blocks.
The win was well deserved for a young Trojan squad who had been playing well but was lacking results. Albeit for games against No. 11 Utah and UCLA, the Trojans were able to hang around with some of the best in the Pac-12. However, the team often let the game slip down the stretch.
“This is a big game for us because our players need to prove to themselves that they can compete at this level — and also have a goal to win some more games the rest of the year,” head coach Andy Enfield said.
With the win, the Trojans (10-15, 2-11) will hope to build some momentum heading into what should be their toughest test yet against. Led by standout freshman Stanley Johnson, the Wildcats (22-3, 10-2) place just outside the top-25 in both points per game and points allowed per game.
One of the reasons for Arizona’s consistency on both sides of the court is the experience of their squad. The Wildcats returned 13 players from last years Elite Eight squad and the addition of Johnson only added to their depth.
The Trojans sit on the opposite end of that spectrum with one of the youngest teams in the country. Though the freshman have struggled with their play throughout the season, the upperclassmen have stepped their game up.
Sophomore transfer Katin Reinhardt is averaging 13.2 points per game in his last five and has started to find his stroke from 3-point range, shooting above 40 percent during that stretch.
Since being inserted into the starting lineup, sophomore Julian Jacobs has put in two solid games, averaging 16 points, seven assists and seven rebounds. With McLaughlin out for the foreseeable future both Reinhardt and Jacobs will need to keep their play up.
On top of their inexperience, the Trojans lack a true 7-footer and are often exposed on the glass and in the paint. Sophomore Nikola Jovanovic, who stands at              6-foot-10, is usually tasked with guarding the other team’s tallest player. Despite leading the team in points, rebounds, and field goal percentage, Jovanovic has been in a slump as of late.
The second-year Serbian has scored in double-digits only once in his last five games and hasn’t broken double-digit rebounds in his last seven. With Arizona boasting one of the best front courts in the nation, the Trojans will need Jovanovic breaks out of his slump.
The Wildcats will look to expose their huge size advantage starting with their front court duo of Kaleb Tarczewski, a true 7-footer, and Brandon Ashley. Senior T.J. McConnell, currently second in assists per game in the Pac-12 and sophomore Rondae Hollis-Jefferson round out a very experienced starting five for the Wildcats.
The Trojans, who have yet to win a Pac-12 game on the road, are faced with a tall task heading into Tucson. The Wildcats are undefeated this season at McKale Center, outscoring opponents by an average of 22 points. Their last home loss came against Cal, over two years ago.
Tip-off is set for Thursday, Feb. 19 at 6 p.m. The game will be aired on the Pac-12 Network.

No. 3 USC men’s volleyball (9-3, 8-3 MPSF) dropped their second straight match to No. 8 UC Santa Barbara (9-5, 5-5 MPSF) 19-25, 17-25, 22-25.
While USC lost the first two sets, there wasn’t much of a worry as the Trojans have dropped the first two sets in their last two matches against BYU, who they split the two-game series with.
USC took an early lead in the first set, but then the Gauchos tied it up at 9. From that point on, UCSB built up a lead and ran away with the set. In the first set, senior middle blocker Robert Feathers had a .500 hitting percentage with three kills.
From the start of the second set, UCSB built and maintained their lead over USC, but the Trojans tried to fight back.
Senior opposite Cristian Rivera, red shirt sophomore outside hitter Christopher Orenic and Feathers put together some impressive kills, but they just were not enough to catch the Gauchos. Orenic tallied up an ace to get the momentum going for the Trojans, but UCSB shut the Trojan attack down and took the second set.
The third set started off with back-and-forth scoring and was tied at 2. A huge roof by senior setter Micah Christenson and Feathers kept the Trojans going with a 5-3 lead.
With the set tied up at 9, the Trojans pushed forward to take the lead with a kill on an overpass by Feathers. UCSB took the lead back, but a setter dump from Christenson tied the set up at 14. Orenic followed with a tool to put the Trojans ahead by one.
Christenson put up a big kill to increase the Trojans’ lead to three at 18-15, and the pressure forced UCSB to call a timeout. USC kept pushing forward and fought off UCSB’s attempt to come back. The Trojans were within reach of winning the set at 22-20, but UCSB surpassed them and won the set and match 25-22 with a block.
Head coach Bill Ferguson pointed out that one major weakness for the Trojans in this match — and the series against BYU — has been their mentality. They started off the season with great mental toughness, but recently they’ve been “internalizing too much.”
“I’d like to see veteran guys continue to step up and lead,” Ferguson said.
Ferguson would also like to see his team improve when it comes responding to a set back — something they were so good at during the beginning of the season.
This is the first losing sweep that USC has had all season. Their previous two losses were in five and four sets, Hawai’i and BYU respectively.
“We were not coming out crisp enough,” Ferguson mentioned. “We took too long to play with a rhythm.”
Ferguson has no doubt that his team can recover and regain their winning streak and all-around dominance.
“We need to just let go mentally and move on,” Ferguson said.
The Trojans will have a chance to regroup at home before they head over to the Pauley Pavilion to face No. 11 UCLA at 7:30 p.m. on Sunday, Feb. 22.
It is the coaches job to have his team mentally ready for each match. This team realistically is lacking in talent especially  at the outside hitters position. The three main players at that spot hit negative against UCSB. Last year’s Freshman of the year Lucas Yoder has disappeared so far this season understanding he had some health problems at beginning of the season. Recruiting has been way off last three years with no one the likes of Murphy Troy or Tony Ciarelli. Changes in staff might be in order to get the program back to near the top. Losing Micah Christenson and Robert Feathers for next season makes things look bleak for any
major resurgence.

The films nominated in the documentary short subject category are usually some of the least-watched of the Oscars. These films are hard to find and difficult to watch due to the nature of the subjects. The field this year was no exception in terms of subject matter. To obtain an idea of the level of hardship that these films cover, perhaps the least challenging subject involved displaced families enduring the harsh North Dakota winter. The rest of the films were all equally, if not more heart-wrenching in their own ways.
The film focusing on North Dakota is White Earth. It focuses on the lives of the families of different oil workers in North Dakota. The northern state undergoes a major oil boom that attracts workers by the thousands. This rapidly overpopulates the towns and forces people to spend the unforgiving winter in trailers or homeless. The film does not depict the difficulties facing the workers, however. That film, if done right, would have likely ended up as a Wages of Fear-type depiction of struggle against the elements. Instead, the filmmakers focused on the family members of the workers, most of whom have relocated from much warmer climates. White Earth accomplishes what it aims to, but one can’t help but wonder at what could have been if the film had focused on the lives of the men out in the oil fields for 18 hours a day in sub-zero temperatures.
Next is La Parka, out of Mexico. This film is the most strange of the five nominees, as it does the least to explain itself. With a running time of 29 mimutes, it takes six minutes for the first words of dialogue to be spoken. The first few minutes are simply filled with aesthetically pleasing shots of a slaughterhouse. Once the subject of the film finally begins talking, the viewer is very slowly clued in to the story of Efrain, a man who has been working in a slaughterhouse for the past 25 years. Despite the interesting subject matter, the viewer doesn’t get much substance from the short. While the shots are all very well done and create a permeating atmosphere of quiet dread and gloom, Efrain’s reflections on death and killing cows — Efrain estimates he has personally killed more than 4.5 million cows in his career — never really amount to much beyond tired banalities about death.
In Joanna, death is much more real. In one of two nominated Polish shorts, a woman who has been diagnosed with a terminal illness aims to record precious moments with her young son, Jas, before her time is up. Where La Parka attempts to wrestle with death by talking about it, Joanna does not address it — not directly, anyway. Instead, the film focuses on a mother who tries to muster up her obviously failing strength to enjoy time with her child. It presents a much more heartbreaking and powerful depiction. Though it is never addressed, death is always present in the scenes. However, Joanna remains defiant with her positivity and protects Jas from the pain she holds inside. It is a beautiful picture of love and certainly one of the most powerful shorts in this year’s field.
The other Polish entry is also powerful, but in a darker way. Our Curse focuses on the difficult road that director Tomasz Sliwinski and his wife walks; their infant son struggles with the rare and incurable congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, otherwise known as Ondine’s curse. A significant portion of the film consists of the couple speaking frankly with each other about their feelings about their young son’s ordeal. The conversations, understandably, are very bleak; however, the two are very candid about their feelings. They talk about resenting the child for the pain he causes and about their fears of him growing up to commit suicide. The couple doesn’t pull any punches, and it is their unflinching look at life coming apart that gives the film its strength. Unfortunately, the starkness that showcases the film’s biggest strength is also its biggest weakness: it looks like a series of home videos of a couple on the couch; there is not much artistry. Therefore, Our Curse suffers next to the films that manage to be powerful and artistic at the same time.
Crisis Hotline: Veterans Press 1 is the best example of this balance. The film focuses on a call center in upstate New York dedicated to handle calls from veterans contemplating suicide. The film takes place entirely in the office; scenes jump from cubicle to cubicle and show different workers with their respective challenges. Compared to the strikingly frigid landscapes of North Dakota and the gory interiors of the slaughterhouse, office cubicles should not be able to compete in terms of interest and suspense. But, with a dynamic camera, Crisis Hotline manages to do just that. The cubicles seem to swallow the callers as they struggle to reach out over to the phone to the men suffering on the other side. With American Sniper recently re-sparking the conversation about the cost of war on a soldier, Crisis Hotline squarely hits a nerve. It, along with Joanna, manages to find the right balance between very difficult subject matter and artistry to present a powerful product. Joanna looks poised to win, but Crisis Hotline should be right on its heels.

Most flea markets involve early mornings, crowded aisles, random junk and loud barterers. Shoppers line up at the crack of dawn, then spend the day jostling each other and haggling with sellers for lower prices. Melrose differs from most outdoor markets, however, beginning with its name — it’s known not as a “flea market,” but as a “trading post.”
This title aptly describes the market’s atmosphere. It’s not an overwhelming shopping space. Rather, it’s a laid-back, one-stop shop. Unlike most flea markets, which open early in the morning, Melrose Trading Post is open from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. every Sunday, allowing shoppers ample time to leisurely peruse stands.
Melrose Trading Post is located at Fairfax High School — just a few blocks north of The Grove — in West Hollywood. A hipster paradise, the neighborhood is sprinkled with colorful murals, record stores and clothing shops such as Urban Outfitters and American Apparel.
The Trading Post attracts famous visitors; Taylor Swift and Lana del Rey have both been spotted. So for those of you who moved to Los Angeles with hopes of meeting someone famous, the Trading Post may be the perfect place to celeb-stalk.
After paying our $3 admission, we entered the high school’s quad, which was packed with vendors primarily selling vintage and repurposed goods. Fairfax High School students collect tickets and provide information about the market.
If I’d visited the Trading Post back in August, I would have the most coveted dorm decor at USC. My walls would be covered with hand-lettered signs featuring inspirational quotes, and my ceiling would be draped with tie-dyed tapestries. One vendor sells succulents and cactuses for only a dollar, and I spent way too much time trying to determine how many cacti one human actually needs. Unfortunately, many of the finds, such as pink plush chairs and hefty typewriters, are not practical for a dorm room.
Vintage clothing stalls dominate the shopping space, which is essentially a thrift store for lazy people — instead of combing through piles of junk to find one treasure, someone else has already laid out all of the treasures for you. Everything I’ve ever hunted for meticulously in a thrift shop was right in front of me. Clothing racks are crammed with overalls, cowboy boots, Hawaiian shirts and other typically hard-to-find vintage items. It’s easy to spot the Post’s regulars, dressed in clothes similar to those on the racks and greeted enthusiastically by vendors.
Like many flea markets, the Trading Post relies on other people’s used items. However, instead of simply selling items as is, vendors repurpose old items. One vendor creates clocks out of aging books. Another, Luke Hobbs Design, turns vintage light bulbs into contemporary light fixtures. Detroit Trash simply transforms trinkets from the city’s abandoned buildings into necklaces.
Of course, it’s not a real Los Angeles attraction if there’s not at least one odd novelty. The Real Bugs stand touts earrings, rings and necklaces featuring a diverse array of bugs, as well as scorpion suckers and Dinner for Schmucks-esque posed mice.
Flea market shopping can be approached in two ways: haphazardly buying whatever stands out, or specifically searching for one item. I followed the latter, with a goal of finding a small Buddha figure, of which the flea market has hundreds. This led to my first experience with the Trading Post’s laid-back bartering. As I eyed a small figure, the vendor told me to name the price. I panicked, afraid my price would be too low and that I would offend the seller. I ended up paying $15 for a Buddha which was $5 at the booth next door, and somehow the sale ended with the overly friendly vendor kissing me on the cheek. Don’t worry, I’ll learn to casually barter as well as the regulars by my next trip.
After the cheek-kissing incident, I took a break from shopping to visit the food stands. Trendy food stalls cater to the hip clientele; among the offerings were crepes, gourmet cheeses and candied walnuts.
If you ever suffer from buyer’s remorse, just remember that the Melrose Trading Post serves as a fundraiser for Fairfax High School. The Greenway Arts Alliance originally partnered with Fairfax High and founded the Friends of Fairfax organization in order to fund student activities not included in the school’s budget. Money from the Trading Post’s sales helps with sports uniforms, school newspaper printing and math tournament fees.
All in all, the Melrose Trading Post offers ample ways to spend your Sunday feeling good about yourself. Bring out your inner hipster, negate environmental impact by purchasing used items and benefit a local school all at once.

Awards season is a defining moment in fashion for celebrities. In the past, some of the most infamous, beautiful and groundbreaking styles have been revealed on the red carpets across Hollywood. This season continued to impress and shock as all kinds of crazy, new, gorgeous looks hit the red carpet.
One of the first award shows was the Golden Globes, exhibiting all the major stars and their shocking fashion choices. Jennifer Lopez, a person of fashion interest at almost every award show, dressed to impress in a gorgeous plunging neckline gown, showing off her beautiful body. Kate Hudson was also seen sporting a number with a plunging neckline and side cutouts, made complete by her sunny blonde grace.
The Old-Hollywood look was also popular at the Golden Globes, as the new “Mrs. Clooney,” Amal Alamuddin, strutted in a regal, classic black and white gown.
There were also some fashion risks at the Globes, including Lupita Nyong’o who dazzled in a floral inspired Giambattista Valli gown. Emma Stone went the comfortable and fashionable route with her classy pantsuit that only she could pull off with effortless grace.
Though many stars shone and sparkled, a few seemed to take risks that didn’t stun and inspire as many as they might have wanted to. Alan Cumming wore a flesh-toned Calvin Klein suit that didn’t exactly flatter his suave demeanor in The Good Wife. Pairing the nude suit with colorful sneakers enhanced the amateur fashion of this great actor. It seemed there was a lack of fashion inspiration for the men at the Golden Globes, as Kevin Hart was overshadowed by his dated-looking white piped suit.
Women were not exempt; some leading ladies didn’t bring their fashion A-game, either. Host Tina Fey, wonderful woman that she is, donned a doily-looking dress that didn’t enhance her beautiful figure. Kristen Wiig wore a too-loose draped gown that swallowed her thin frame and created a drab look on the comedic genius.
The Screen Actors Guild Awards was also a place of fashion inspiration. On Sunday, Jan. 25, stars from Keira Knightley to Julianne Moore waltzed across the red carpet in couture creations.
Natalie Dormer from Game of Thrones donned a feminine floral gown that made her angelic features look positively luminescent. Saucy Sophia Vergara was stunning as always in a silky and slinky red gown, highlighting her curvaceous body.
The sparkle was on as stars like Emmy Rossum donned glitter galore. Laverne Cox sported her glitz in a Cleopatra-inspired pink satin gown, proving she can be not only an emotional inspiration, but also a fashion icon. Sarah Hyland glowed in a jeweled Vera Wang gown, transforming her youthful persona into an elegant and beautiful woman.
Some fashion flops at the SAG Awards included usual fashion star Lupita Nyong’o. Though elegant and lithe, the dress she chose for the night drowned her tiny body in its over-indulgent use of fabrics and patterns. Lorelei Linklater’s gown screamed “maid-meets-choir dress,” and Rashida Jones chose a not-too-mature style complete with awkward color blocking and pattern arrangement. These faux pas show that, despite how talented some of these actors might be, their fashion senses are not always award-worthy.
The Grammys this year brought some of the most stunning fashions yet. Musical guests from every genre brought out their most awe-inspiring fashions to match up to their award-winning songs and albums.
Despite the controversy surrounding Ariana Grande recently, the star made an appearance and stunned at the Grammys in a white and silver Versace gown that showed off her tiny frame. Miley Cyrus is known for her outrageous style, but dressed to impress this year. She rocked a black slim-fitting gown with cutouts, showing a tasteful amount of skin. Along with her classy makeup and styled hair, Miley was a strong contender for best-dressed at the Grammys.
Accompanying her rap-star husband, Kim Kardashian West looked like a Greek goddess in a shimmery gold gown. Showing off her bronzed skin, Kim looked chic and mature as she walked hand-in-hand with Kanye.
Some singers just couldn’t rock the red carpet at the Grammys. Barbadian pop queen Rihanna looked like a frilly cupcake in an over-the-top, a la Lady Gaga pink dress that was completely out-of-character for the edgy star. Madonna, as usual, was also a little too trashy rather than classy as the older singer walked down the runway in a lacy pink and black outfit.
No matter which award show, 2015 has proved to be a year of fashion inspiration and improvement. Coming up at the end of February, the Oscars will continue to present some of the most interesting fashion choices from the most famous celebrities.

This week, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) released a video depicting the beheading of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya. The video is the latest demonstration of the level of communication ISIS has within its satellite groups.
Before I begin, I want to say that I am a Coptic Christian myself. Like most Copts, I bear a cross tattoo on my right wrist. The practice was borne from identifying oneself in a country that is predominantly Muslim. For centuries, the Coptic faith has been persecuted and marginalized by extremist groups, but the most recent killing endures a brunt of the suffering because of the scope of its geopolitical ramifications and role in the continuing narrative of ISIS’s actions.
This is not the first time ISIS has posted videos of beheadings. The group is believed to have beheaded around 259 people total, most recently the 21 Egyptian Christians. That’s 259 known cases, but there are unquestionably countless others who have lost their lives at the hands of ISIS.
Last August, I wrote in a column that hostage negotiations should not be an option with terrorists. After the beheading of American journalist James Foley, the international community condemned the organization, and many, including myself, believed that negotiating with ISIS was problematic and would set a dangerous precedent. Today, that argument still stands, but with the heinous crime committed on the shores of Libya, our attitude must change. It’s become clear that ISIS is a cancer. It is metastasizing across the Middle East, Southwest Asia and North Africa. With such a insidious enemy that employs such volatile and lethal methods, the time has come to dispose of such a tragedy in our global history.
The 21 who lay dead and whose blood is on the hands of there barbaric extremists is the last straw: the writing is on the wall for ISIS. After the release of the video, Egypt’s air force went on the offensive and targeted ISIS training camps and weapons stocks in Libya.
It is time that discourse about the aggression of ISIS be more refined and honest. Despite being highly organized, financially equipped and technologically savvy, ISIS’s actions are deplorable and barbaric. The organization shouldn’t even be called the Islamic State; no religion condones the killing of innocent people on such a massive scale. It is disheartening to think that it has become the norm to hear of weekly beheadings and massacres in the news. The blatant and unabashedly explicit videos ISIS creates cannot go without adamant condemnation. As Jon Stewart said, “You know an organization has passed the tipping point of absolute barbarism when even al-Qaeda looks at you and thinks it’s immoral.” The beheadings are not only appalling and atrocious, but they also make the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram seem like yesterday’s news.
The United States and the rest of the global community have severely underestimated the unmitigated gall of these unrelenting radicals. Earlier this month, they went so far as to release yet another video, this time showing the beheading of Japanese journalist Kenji Goto. What does a country like Japan, which has largely remained tepid in international relations since the end of World War II, have to do with ISIS? When it comes to a faction as malicious as ISIS, there are no moral bounds — there is an infinite capacity for hate, and there is an unquenching thirst to be part of the social narrative.
ISIS is more than a terrorist organization. It is a conflict with the conscience of the world. It has surpassed the level of moral hazard we have seen and poses one of the biggest risks to global security since World War II if we allow its barbaric actions to continue. The videos must stop. The beheadings must cease. When does the rhetoric from the West stop and action begin? The 21 Copts whose lives were taken offer an ominous tone and present a harbinger of what ISIS is capable of. Their massacre demonstrates the necessity of action from all countries, not just the U.S. or Egypt. The onus is on the global community to defeat ISIS and end these killings. If the cold-blooded murder of hundreds of people is not a requisite for the complete dismantling of the Islamic State, then there is something fundamentally and profoundly wrong with our societal makeup.
Air strikes should continue against training camps and hot spots of ISIS in both its traditional base in Iraq and Syria, as well as its satellite bases in Libya. Furthermore, rather than continue to witness bloodshed, the U.S., European Union and Arab countries such as Egypt and Libya need to form a strong coalition to defeat ISIS. In a region that far too often sees a cycle of stratification in terms of ideology and subsequent policy, this is an opportunity to unite against a common enemy. Disparate countries such as Syria and Japan have both suffered losses, and if cooperation is formed from defeating the Islamic State, it may prove to be the foundation for changing other diplomatic negotiations and dynamics.
For the 21 Copts beheaded and for all those decapitated and murdered by senseless acts of violence and brutality, the end of ISIS must come now.

I am still trying to understand how a small militant group that is rolling over nearly unarmed villages in the middle east is a threat to the USA? Are we so vulnerable that a 50K person army could destroy the entire US military, county sheriffs, local police, and criminal gangsters? Even with nuclear weapons, ISIS would have a hard time destroying ONE of the 50 states.
So you believe in the imaginary friend concept…lol! Dont worry this disease is far too common in America today!
Barack and Hillary freed Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi on the condition that he would organize men to fight against Assad in Syria.
They were warned by experts not to do this and the result is ISIS.
Chris Stevens was killed while trying to broker a deal for Kadaffi’s weapons stockpiles that were going to be used to arm Abu Bakr’s men in Syria since congress officially denied their request to arm Syrian Rebels.
ISIS is the largest faction of Syrian Rebels and received most of the US aid that was supposedly going to “Moderate Sunni Rebels” in Syria fighting Assad.
They hoodwinked us, those “Moderates” didn’t even make up 10% of the rebel effort against Assad in Syria.
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton created, supplied and gave military and material support to what is now known as ISIS.
I’ve got a novel idea. Let’s do nothing. Let the Muslims deal with their own
problems for a change. Let’s let countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait
with their endless ocean of money and Western-bought armaments figure it out
instead. Surely they – being practitioners of the religion of compassion and
peace – will step right up to the plate in our stead.
OK, you caught me there. You knew I was kidding! You knew what I know which
is that there is no answer to these Islamic cesspools. Whatever we do will be
discredited and if we do nothing then Syria will become just another country in
the endless line of Hell on Earth Islamic countries.
We cannot save Muslims from themselves. It is like trying to save an
alcoholic. Until they are ready to abandon their religion – a religion that
emphasizes aggression and violence and sadism – anything we do will simply be a
band-aid on a gaping wound.
Let them go through their DTs on their own. Only then will they be ready for
our friendship and help, and only then will we find a way forward together as
friends.

You have a short memory, Mr. Stockholm Syndrome.  The number of jihadist barbaric acts that exceed the death toll you are so upset about is on the order of 100+.  You are just upset about this one because it effects your people.  Really very selfish on your part.
A.G. writes, “The organization shouldn’t even be called the Islamic State; no religion condones the killing of innocent people on such a massive scale.”

You obviously have no idea what Islam’s core tenets are.  Found throughout the Qur’an, Hadiths and Sunna one can find calls for death to infidels.  Of course the fact that what ISIS did is nothing new and has been happening since Mohammed’s days evidently escapes you as well.

You need to read up on the Stockholm Syndrome because you are a better example of this than anyone I have ever encountered.

Building resumes, checking admissions data and visiting dream schools are activities familiar to juniors and seniors in high school. In the ever increasing college frenzy, however, this lifestyle is now trickling down to the middle and elementary school levels. Educating children about college is a necessary step toward getting more of them into college. However, as we prepare these students, we must ensure that we don’t prematurely burden them with the stresses faced by their older peers.
For years, elementary schools, charter schools, especially, have participated in tours of prominent universities. Recently, the combination of lower acceptance rates and increasing pressure to get into top schools has made tours more popular. In some areas, elementary college prep has expanded from tours to usage of programs like Naviance, a site which estimates a student’s college chances.
According to an annual study by UCLA, this year’s national class of incoming freshman are at a record low for emotional health, with approximately one in 10 students reporting that they frequently feel depressed. This can partially be attributed to the built-up pressure students faced in high school or prior to high school.
As difficult as it might sound, it is possible to increase college readiness without contributing to the college frenzy. It requires a careful balancing act. Parents and educators alike need to distinguish between helpful efforts, such as college tours, and hindering efforts, such as asking a 10-year-old to use a website that numerically judges their chance to go to college.
Many parents with adequate resources will do whatever they can to get their child ahead. This includes tutoring, SAT prep and expensive college visits. But for students in lower-income families, their college readiness experience could be limited to what they learn at school.
According to the Pell Institute, the rate at which affluent students obtain bachelor’s degrees has risen from 40 to 77 percent from 1970 to 2013. During the same period, the rate at which low-income students earn degrees has risen from 6 to 9 percent.
There are numerous reasons for this discrepancy, and obviously there is not a single solution that would allow low-income students to graduate from college at the same rate as their more affluent peers. Simply exposing more students to the idea of college could be a vital first step. Obviously, if a child is raised by two proud college graduates, he or she will grow up with an understanding of what college is, as well as the probable expectation that he or she too will one day attend. The parents might take him or her to tour their alma mater, buy memorabilia and tell countless stories about their experience.
For potential first-generation college students, the gap between them and their peers begins at this basic level.  If a child’s parents don’t know enough about college to discuss it with them, and students don’t hear about college at school, they are left with a very vague idea of what higher education is.
Taking groups of elementary students to tour college campuses is innocent enough, and a fun field trip alone won’t send students into spiraling stress and pressure.  The problem arises when parents and educators take this simple experience to the next level through college prep software.
Usage of the aforementioned Naviance among younger students is increasing: in the past five years, 1,700 middle schools have purchased the Naviance software that allows students from fifth through eighth grade to explore college options. The software also allows students to evaluate their activities through resumé building.
Middle schoolers shouldn’t be concerned about whether their activities will look good to colleges, they should be concerned with whether they’re enjoying their school experience.  Furthermore, it should go without saying that no middle school student needs a resume.
Schools can teach students about college without overwhelming them. This could be done by implementing more casual and candid tactics, such as college tours or short lessons. “Career Day” is a traditional event at most schools; why not host “College Day?” Schools could set aside one day a year to invite college students and professors to speak to students. The trick is keeping conversations broad, without specifically ranking schools and prematurely forcing kids to focus on acceptance rates.
It’s important that we encourage all students, regardless of income, to aim high. A shift toward elementary college prep may be necessary, but it needs to be done carefully. Resumés are for briefcases, not school lunch boxes.

Feb. 8 marked the 57th Grammy Awards. While the Grammys are the most recognizable awards celebrating musical accomplishment, people have mostly been talking about Kanye West’s interruption of Beck’s speech for winning Album of the Year.
Back in 2009 during the MTV Video Music Awards, West infamously cut off Taylor Swift’s speech for winning Best Female Video, claiming that Beyoncé should have won the category. The incident caused a huge controversy, and Swift’s fans were infuriated. When Beck won Album of the Year over Beyonce at this year’s Grammys, West “jokingly” hopped on stage and acted as if he was about to interrupt Beck the same way he cut off Swift years ago. This time, West left the stage without saying a word, making it apparent that it was a humorous act. That, however, was not the end of the story.
Backstage after the awards, West revealed to E! News the reason behind his action. He said that Beck “needs to respect artistry” and “should have given his award to Beyonce.” West further stated that he, among other “real artists,” was “fighting for creativity;” and he accused the Grammys of being “disrespectful to inspiration.” These comments immediately went viral, as they insinuated that Beck was not a real artist.
To clarify his comments regarding Beck, West went on Ryan Seacrest’s radio show to discuss the incident. He told Seacrest that he considered Beck to be “one of the most respected musicians,” contradicting what he said in his interview with E!. West also criticized the Grammys again, calling his interruption a “joke, like the Grammys themselves.”
Though West’s comments about the Grammys were quite arrogant and outrageous, the public did not seem that surprised. Many entertainment writers who commented on the incident said  that if anyone were to make a scene at the Grammys, it would be West. People will never know the motive behind West’s actions — whether it was to grab the media’s attention before his Adidas runway show or to stand up for the music industry in the heat of the moment.
Artists should be encouraged to express their frustration if they feel that they, or other artists, have been mistreated by The Recording Academy. That, however, is not the problem here. The troublesome aspect of West’s protest is the fact that he calls attention to himself by disrespecting other artists. What’s even more disturbing is that not only do artists and celebrities tolerate Kanye’s bluntness, but they also show him appreciation and the utmost respect.
When West jumped onstage with Beck, Beck took the joke well and gestured to Kanye to stay onstage with him. Beck went even further to call West a “genius” that he “aspires to.” This comment might make Beck seem genuine and likable, but it also makes him a happy victim that wants to be on Kanye’s good side. This is not to say that Beck does not truly look up to West’s musical talent, but Beck seems eager to please West right after being insulted in front of millions.
Similarly, Swift might not have been the biggest Kanye West fan in the past, but she certainly is trying hard to start an amicable relationship with the very person that left her speechless on stage in 2009. West told Seacrest that immediately after he got off stage with Beck, Swift ran up to him and said that he should have gone on stage. She then offered to work together with West in the studio, an offer that Kanye gladly accepted.
The irony behind Beck’s and Swift’s relationships with West can easily be explained by their desire to gain more publicity, please their fans and create business opportunities. By supporting and accepting West’s behavior even after being humiliated by him, however. these celebrities are showing the public that certain people should be able to get away with rude behavior. In addition, such disrespectful actions and comments are portrayed as funny, socially acceptable and even cool. As the DJ duo The Chainsmokers put it in their hit single “Kanye,” “I wanna be like Kanye … Do what I want, I’ll have it my way.” The duo told Buzzfeed that by referring to “Kanye,” they meant “owning it no matter what you’re doing” and “enjoying the moment you’re in and feeling like you’re the king.” Again, we see celebrities glorifying West’s self-absorbed actions, encouraging fans to do what they want regardless of how others might be affected.
The main takeaway is that though the public can laugh about these moments — it’s entertainment, after all — it should also be critical and consider the potential consequences of the tolerance and glorification of oppressive and rude behavior. Celebrities, as role models, should set the example that disrespectful behavior toward others should be condemned, not rewarded.

Many prominent realms of academia (the sciences and, ironically, the “progressive” humanities) are ever eager to dismiss considerations of the human soul, and if I were inclined to acknowledge mankind as merely the most evolved in a hierarchy of spiritless beasts, I would have to renounce my fascination with art, with identity, with the distinctly human appreciation of beauty, and with the uniquely human ability to consider our place in a larger world. The ancient truth is that humans are not soulless creatures, and such fact is proven in that we can love, we can create — and we can hate.
We are, however, quick to forget the human spirit when faced with bias and racism. It’s difficult for the media to address something as intangible as corruptions of the heart when tragedies like the Chapel Hill shootings occur. In their secularism, would-be change-makers are left to aimlessly contemplate the situations of society that lead to heinous acts and the circumstances of upbringing that cause human beings to despise one another. The media becomes one great merry-go-round: exhibiting disdain and producing it in turn, a dizzying road leading nowhere.
I am not absolved of the crime of hatred. I feel it almost everyday when faced with injustice, with evil, with the corrupt of our government, but I’m here to tell you that even the most righteous hatred never moved mountains. I previously said that we are human — that we are soulful — because we can hate. Now I say that we are the best of humanity when in the face of hatred, we choose to love.
This is not a sermon — these are the words of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who still stands today a champion of the people: “Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” I cannot ask you not to be angry when you face discrimination, when you see the distrust in someone else’s eyes because you look different or speak differently, when you see your brothers and sisters killed for being who they are. Anger and rage are your right, but love is our responsibility.
Only when I can look upon those who would hate me with compassion will I become a stronger woman. Only when we can see each other as equal souls in need of kindness will mountains begin to move.

The USC Sports Business Association hosted Leigh Steinberg, one of the most influential sports agents in all of sports, on Tuesday night at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Steinberg is more than just a top-notch agent — he is a pioneer in the industry and serves as a role model for sports agents everywhere. He is a distinguished public speaker who took the time to stop by USC this week to relay his vast wealth of information from his 30 years of experience in the industry. He also discussed the ever-changing sports world and the many opportunities for college students looking to get their foot in the industry door.
Steinberg recounted his experiences with former star athletes from various sports. He even offered an anecdote about one of his recent clients, Pittsburgh Steelers’ quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.
Steinberg referenced two core values to which he adheres: treasure relationships, especially family, and try to make a meaningful impact on the world and help people who cannot help themselves.
Throughout the presentation, Steinberg stressed the idea that athletes can be the best role models for others. He spoke about how one athlete’s voice on a certain issue often carries more weight than the voices of one thousand other authorities ever could.
His impressive list of past clientele includes—but is not limited to—Steve Bartkowski, Warren Moon, Troy Aikman, Steve Young, Edgerrin James and Oscar de la Hoya. While working with these star athletes, Steinberg challenged these professionals to put together programs for the public that would focus on something near and dear to their hearts in order to make a positive impact on others.
“Athletes can also be role models in terms of messaging,” Steinberg said.
Not only did Steinberg mention the importance of messaging as a cultural symbol, but he also delved into the current state of relationships between professional athletes and their agents.
“These athletes are better protected than ever before,” he said. “Athletes select better and better agents, and they select financial planners that will help them with budgeting, that will help them with long-term planning, understanding the tax system—the goal is to empower the player.”
Steinberg noted that an understanding of human psychology has done wonders for him in terms of helping his clients.
“The most important skill I could ever pass on is psychology,” he said. “If you can understand human motivation—what makes people act the way they do—and if you have great listening skills, you can draw someone else out and get beyond the surface of what they are saying. Peel the layer of the onion back until you are actually speaking about what’s critical to that person. It takes being patient. It takes listening. It takes a sense of comfort. Once you can put yourself in the heart and mind of the other person, you’ll be successful in whatever you do in life because you can craft win-win negotiations. You can craft win-win situations.”
Steinberg explained that in order to understand others, though, one must first understand oneself. He explained that listening to and understanding someone else’s system are essential pieces to the puzzle that is healthy human interaction and negotiation. He described how making a list of priorities in one’s own life is a great way to help others because when someone knows what is critical in life for himself or herself, it becomes that much easier to understand what is critical in life for someone else.
Psychology is key because people are people. This translates to every sport and to every phase of life. “At the end of the day, it’s people,” Steinberg said. “What is universal is understanding people’s real needs—what their anxieties and fears are and their greatest hopes and dreams. It takes going below the surface. This whole area of sports business is an area where the best and brightest can still make an impact.”
As far as his goals for working with athletes, Steinberg has exemplified patience, a key to avoiding conflict and working together with his clients to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. “The goal,” he said, “is to stimulate the best in individual athletes’ lives and to make the sport better.”
Steinberg has made his mark on the sports world as one of the finest agents in the business, but he left the audience of USC students on Tuesday night with some fantastic advice to keep in mind, regardless of which career fields these youngsters ultimately pursue. “If you believe that what you are doing matters,” he said, “you’ll have energy and enthusiasm to spare.”
USC senior Jake Kelfer,  president of the USC Sports Business Association , is preparing to leave college life, but not before taking a tidbit or two from Mr. Steinberg with him.
“He said to stand out,” Kelfer said. “Find a way to distinguish yourself from everyone else, and that’s something that I have really focused on and tried to find new ways to really stand out and provide value to the company.”
Senior Skylar Dunn also felt the presentation was very informative and that Mr. Steinberg was very personable.
“I didn’t expect him to get up here and really talk about his life and his business and give us so much insight into the sports agent life,” Dunn said. “I think Leigh kind of stood up here tonight and told us that his [secret] was being able to listen and build relationships with people.”

The USC women’s basketball team traveled up to Northern California, hoping to continue a modest two-game winning streak after a pair of home wins last weekend against Colorado and Utah. The winning streak didn’t last long, as the Women of Troy suffered a 79-60 defeat at the hands of No. 19 Stanford in Palo Alto, but bounced back to upset California 65-54 in Berkeley.
Senior forward Alexyz Vaioletama led the Women of Troy (14-11, 6-8 Pac-12) with a combined 31 points over the weekend, along with 12 rebounds. Senior forward Kaneisha Horn added 27 points and a team-leading 18 rebounds.
Vaioletama led the Women of Troy with 14 points against the Cardinal, along with five rebounds. Sophomore guard Courtney Jaco scored 11 points, while Horn and junior guard Brianna Barrett added 10 points each. Horn grabbed 11 rebounds for her second double-double of the season, while Barrett added four assists and four rebounds.
Lili Thompson led Stanford (19-7, 11-3 Pac-12) with 14 points and four assists. Amber Orrange and Briana Roberson added 13 points each, while Bonnie Samuelson finished with 12 points and six rebounds.
The game started out with promise, as the two teams alternated leads throughout the first few minutes of the game. USC led            16-14 after a layup by Vaioletama with 13:18 left in the half. However, a 15-4 run by the Cardinal gave them the lead for good, and they’d continue to build their advantage en route to a 38-27 halftime lead.
The Women of Troy wouldn’t give up, however, and started the second half with a 10-4 run to cut Stanford’s lead to 5. That’s as close as USC would get, as Stanford would keep building its lead, ending USC’s two-game winning streak, as well as the Cardinal’s two-game losing streak.
“Our game plan was to come out with a lot of intensity and just push in transition,” Horn said. “When we were doing that, we were playing great basketball. I think we got away from that, and after we stopped protecting, it went downhill from there.”
Stanford shot 55 percent from the field, compared to 38 percent for USC. The Women of Troy did win the rebounding battle again, grabbing 38 boards to Stanford’s 34.
“We started off really strong,” head coach Cynthia                                      Cooper-Dyke said. “I just don’t think we maintained that level of intensity, and when you’re playing against a team like Stanford, you cannot have a letdown defensively.”
USC would have to bounce back quickly, as it only had a day to prepare for a California team that was riding an eight-game winning streak after a 70-64 win over UCLA. They did just that, riding a strong second half. Vaioletama and Horn each finished with 17 points and seven rebounds against the Golden Bears. Sophomore guard Alexis Lloyd added 14 points off the bench.
Reshanda Grey, Cal’s leading scorer with 18.1 points per game, led the Golden Bears (19-6, 11-3 Pac-12) with 32 points and 10 rebounds, but was unable to overcome a lack of offensive production from the rest of the squad. Grey was the only   double-digit scorer on her team, and Cal got no points off its bench, compared to USC’s 16.
The first half was a promising sign for the Women of Troy, who kept it close throughout, even holding a 20-19 lead with 6:30 remaining. The Golden Bears would get hot down the stretch, entering the locker room with a 34-25 lead, with things looking like deja vu for USC.
USC wasn’t about to let history repeat itself in Berkeley. After a layup by Grey gave the Bears a 39-27 lead, Vaioletama and Horn scored 11 unanswered for USC to put them back in the game. After a                  back-and-forth stretch, USC took a 49-48 lead with 8:17 remaining on a layup by Jaco, and held California at bay for a big road win
“We’ve been waiting for Kaneisha to really showcase her complete game all year long, and I thought she did that tonight with her mid-range game,” Cooper-Dyke said. “She really knocked down some jumpers, and her ability to take it to the basket off the bounce. She utilized both of those [Sunday] to really keep the Cal defenders off-balance. When they played her outside shot, she went around them. When they played her penetration, she knocked down the outside shot. She did some good things, and kept us in the game when we were struggling scoring, and then helped seal the deal in the second half.”
Both teams grabbed 34 rebounds, while USC shot 43 percent to Cal’s 40. USC had big advantages from behind the arc and in the turnover battle, shooting 30 percent from downtown to Cal’s 9, while committing 15 turnovers to Cal’s 20.
“This is honestly just the beginning,” Lloyd said. “We have to take every game one step at a time. We can’t rush things, we can’t determine that we’re always going to win game after game. We just have to take one game at a time and practice on executing and playing 100 percent every time we step on the court.”
USC will play its final two home games next weekend, taking on Arizona (9-16, 2-12 Pac-12) on Friday, Feb. 20 at 7 p.m. and No. 12 Arizona State (22-4, 11-3 Pac-12) on Sunday, Feb. 22 at 3 p.m. The Trojans will conclude the regular season with road games against Washington   (19-7, 8-6 Pac-12) on Thursday, Feb. 26 at 6 p.m. and Washington State (14-11, 5-9 Pac-12) on Saturday, Feb. 28 at 3 p.m. The final three games will be available on the Pac-12 Network.

Rini Sampath and Jordan Fowler were announced as the winners of the Undergraduate Student Government presidential election Tuesday night.
The announcement, made by the USG Election and Recruitment Committee at the weekly Senate meeting, revealed a landslide victory.
The Rini-Jordan ticket won with 3,906 votes, 64.83 percent of total votes. Providence Ilisevich and Ehren Elder garnered 1,978 votes, 32.83 percent of total votes.
Sampath and Fowler expressed gratitude for their victory and the fact that they are first all-female ticket to win the USG presidential election.
“It was a family-friendship affair,” Sampath said. “It was just this feeling that this couldn’t have happened without the support of everyone in that room, and everyone on campus as well.
She went on to relate how their win would prove to be an influential aspect for future female candidates.
“This is a victory for the entire university, for many communities too; and given that the nature of the campaign was historic, we’re so excited for our nation as well,” Sampath said. “If this inspires a woman to run every year from now on it will be a dream come true to us.”
Fowler expressed her gratitude to all of the individuals who partook in their campaign.
“We weren’t doing this to break a record or to make this a national campaign. But it ended up being that,” Fowler said. “It was totally a group effort. ‘Thank you’ is what comes off the top of my mind, but that is literally not enough. I don’t know what will be enough to say ‘thank you’ because of the immense gratitude I feel for individuals.”
She went on to describe the roles that different groups played in their victory. The ticket had 48 official endorsements from campus organizations.
“It’s so easy to group the support all together,” Fowler said. “[But] all those people that did the little things were the ones that made all the difference in the world, and we thank you.”
Both Sampath and Fowler said they plan to begin implementing their campaign promises immediately, and that executive officer applications will go live tomorrow so they can begin building their team.
“My biggest focus isn’t waiting until the summer to get started on these ideas,” Fowler said. “I went to 40 organizations and talked to them individually about their goals and desires for the university. Let’s start now. We’re already in meetings. We have a semester left to go, and even though we’re supposed to be transitioning, there are people really excited for these ideas. Let’s start.”
Ilisevich said she has faith Sampath and Fowler will be effective leaders.
“I think Rini and Jordan will do a great job, and I’m looking forward to see what USG continues to do,” Ilisevich said. “But most importantly, I’m hoping to see the student body getting more engaged in these issues and making a change.”
Elder also said he feels Sampath and Fowler will creative positive change at USC.
“I want to congratulate Rini and Jordan; they ran an absolutely incredible campaign and they’re going to do a truly incredible job next year. I think the school is in really good hands with them. I’m excited to keep working in making this university better and moving forward.”
Ilisevich said that she will continue to work to curb sexual violence on campus — one of her leading campaign points. Elder mentioned that his future campus involvement still remains unclear, and he hasn’t decided whether he will engage in USG or return to Interfraternity Council work.
“I certainly I won’t be bored for my senior year,” he said.
The senatorial results were also announced at the meeting. These included the winners of the Greek ballot; Chris Wong (1,293 votes), Darian Nourian (1,224 votes) and Sanjay Mahboobani (1,210 votes); winners of the residential ballot, Sabrina Enriquez (1,440 votes), Alec White (1,269 votes), Aaron Rifkind (1,230 votes), Dan Li (1,228), Eric Dubbury (1,095 votes) and Giuseppe Robalino (1,070); and the winners of the commuter ballot, Cassandra Aguayo (276 votes), Jacob Ellenhorn (194 votes) and Bulk Lao (177 votes).
The total number of votes for this election was 6,027, falling short of the previous year and USG’s goal of 7,000.
Results were announced by Jennifer Glaeser, director of election and recruitment, David Moreno, director of communications and Christine Hennes, senior director of communications.
Hennes explained her excitement toward students showing interest in the future of their student government.
“It’s extremely important to have this culture of voting and being student advocates, because at the end of the day we all want the best student experience possible,” Hennes said. “Everybody getting really excited about their future student leaders is something that needs to continue past election season. Hopefully more people will get involved in the future.”
“The election was kind of abrupt for me because I didn’t know what USG was or when the elections were going to be,” Soomin Shim, a freshman studying business administration, said. “And then I saw the pictures around campus and then I knew that they were active. Voting is important everywhere, but I really didn’t hear what the candidates thought and what they were proposing. And that prevented me from voting and I think more information would’ve helped more students to vote.”
The room erupted when the elections results were announced. “I think it was pretty competitive,” said Sebastian Kim, a freshman studying business administration. “I think it’s definitely important to have students’ voices heard and to promote the idea of getting involved around campus.”

After walking down the streets of Little Tokyo and inhaling the surrounding aromas of customary Asian dishes, my friends and I narrowed down our lunch plans to a good ramen place nearby.
One of the best rated ramen places on the street had over an hour long wait, but just a few doors down we found a hub with great food and personality.
Upon walking into Manichi Ramen located off of 1st St., a man warmly welcomed us into the restaurant and explained how today, Feb. 14, was actually the restaurant’s grand opening. (A perk of walking in on opening day was sampling the Manichi Goyza for free, which are these tasty little dumplings with a mildly-spicy sauce poured over them.)
After opening three Manichi restaurants in Hawaii, the owners decided to bring the name and the food to the mainland.
The newly opened restaurant gave off a cool and hip feel and was decorated with black and red accents. Even the ceramic, imported plates and bowls were the classic “Manichi red” color. Seating is available in tables and a long booth stretches down both sides of the narrow restaurant. Bar-style seating for one (or a few) is located near the kitchen alongside the steam and chefs at work.

Orders were served at separate times for my friends and I, and glasses of water had to be asked to be refilled-but taking into consideration that it was their first official day of work, the staff was fairly on top of everything and quick to serve and please customers.
As far as the food goes, I’m no ramen expert — but I can say my mouth watered after just inhaling the scent of the plates before us.
I ordered the regular Shiromaru Tonkotsu Shibori for $9.95 and a side of fried rice for $3.95. I was promptly served with a big bowl of broth with ramen, thinly sliced Chashu pork, green onions and bean sprouts.

The broth was smooth and salty, the noodles firm and tender, the veggies to a perfect crispness, and the pork was very delicate and soft. (I could have used more than two slices of it.) I liked how there were multiple, different textures and flavors presented in one bowl.

The fried rice was different from most I have tried before (I could say I’m an avid fried rice eater.) The meat was paired well with it, and I can say overall that I did like the rice, but personally I would have preferred a lighter, more authentic taste.

The rice seemed a bit untraditional in a way and had an eggy and oily taste to it that might have weighed it down just a tad, but it was still pretty good.
My friend ordered the number one under the ramen specialties: The Manichi Special Tonkotsu Shibori Ramen for $11.95.
The creamy, spicy miso broth was not overly hot, but had a little kick to it. The dish was more diverse than the simple ramen I ordered, and it looked and tasted vibrant with an added hard-boiled egg.

My friend also ordered the pork rice, which like with my order of fried rice, was not completely satisfying. The rice was a bit too soft again and the sauce was just okay.
As far as the pricing goes, I’d have to say it’s average. For college students, Manichi is definitely not overpriced — it would just be nice to have a side order or an appetizer included into the price of a main order. But the menu offers ramen bowl options that do come with a larger variety of foods mixed in. Additional sides like dried seaweed and fresh garlic can be ordered with your ramen as well.
Overall, the atmosphere, staff, prices and food were up to par, and I’m sure the restaurant will work out its little kinks with time. I’m no ramen expert, so it is difficult to compare Manichi’s standards to surrounding locations.
Being a fan of broth soups and Asian cuisine though, I would not mind driving back down here to enjoy a soothing and flavorful bowl of ramen again on a cooler day (if L.A. decides to act like it’s winter for once.)
Though Little Tokyo offers many authentic Ramen restaurants, if you’re looking for something tasty and average priced situated in a hip environment, (and if you’re bored of your ramen at home), I would suggest you give Manichi a try; the aroma from the kitchen is sure to draw you in upon walking by.

The Academy Awards for short films are normally overlooked when people rush to see all the nominated films they can get their hands on. People know that these films are probably good, but the star power of Benedict Cumberbatch, Emma Stone and Bradley Cooper overshadow the artistic merits of a few short films. Nevertheless, the nominated shorts are again quite good this year. Here, we will take a look at the animated shorts. Coming from the Netherlands, Norway, the U.K. and the U.S., the shorts represent a mix of foreign and domestic creativity. Don’t let the fact that they are animated fool you; the level of creativity apparent in these animations elevates them above the realm of children’s films.
First, A Single Life is the shortest of the nominated films. at a crisp two minutes and 18 seconds; in that short running time, it manages to tell a fun, complete story. In the short, a woman discovers that she has a vinyl record that has the power to travel to various spots on the timeline of her life. The film mixes a playful vibe with a creeping darkness as the woman explores her newfound power. While the first few jumps are played for laughs, the tone quickly transitions to one of trepidation as it becomes clear that the woman is losing control of a power she does not understand. The film is short, sweet and packs a punch without much strain. This is the entry from the Netherlands, but there is no actual dialogue to convey this as everything is communicated visually, which can only be said about two of the shorts nominated this year.
Next up is Me and My Moulton, the Norwegian entry. The film focuses on three sisters, from the point of view of the middle sister. It’s a lighthearted film, and the biggest challenges that the girls have to face are a weird dad and the lack of a bicycle. The film is charming, and the thoughts of the young protagonist are brought to life beautifully by writer and director Torill Kove. Krove already won this award in 2006 for The Danish Poet. The little girl is very troubled that her father is kooky and more importantly, that he is the only man in the village with a mustache. “A big one, like Salvador Dali,” she laments. But over the course of the film, she comes to appreciate her eccentric father and eventually receives a bicycle from him.
The Dam Keeper, an American short introduces us to the most fully realized world of the nominees. In the story, a young pig is the keeper of a dam that holds back a big cloud of soot, for a small town. Despite his instrumental role, the pig is ostracized and made fun of for being different. He becomes friends with a fox who makes funny drawings of classmates; when the pig mistakes one of the drawings as a jest at him, he becomes upset and fails at his duties, causing the town to be covered in darkness. It is a lovely story about friendship, bullying and overcoming adversity. This is probably the film, along with Me and My Moulton, that would be the most appealing to children because of the important lessons on morality it contains.
The Bigger Picture, the entry from the U.K., is by far the most somber of the productions. At the same time, it is also the most visually creative. Writer and director Daisy Jacobs depicts a story of two brothers dealing with their aging, ailing mother. The colors are muted to match the mood of the story, but the medium of the film alone makes it worth a watch. Blending 3D papier-mâché models and 2D painted, life-sized figures, the film is an exploration of the limits of the animated film medium. The story is heartfelt, and the contrast between the emotions of the two brothers packs a serious punch. This film might win due to the incredible interplay between 2D and 3D combined with the powerful story.
Finally, the short that most people will have seen is Feast. The Disney short film that was included before Big Hero 6. Disney Pixar shorts are often the audience favorite because of their inclusion at the beginning of major animated releases. Despite garnering a nomination almost every year, however, only one of these films has actually won the statuette in the last 12 years. That was the excellent Paperman, which was attached to Wreck-It Ralph two years ago. Feast features an adorable tale of a dog and his owner, expertly done, which comes as no surprise. Unfortunately, Feast is no Paperman. It is good, but the slick visuals and easy storyline will most likely pale in comparison to the much more visually impressive The Bigger Picture.

For Valentine’s Day weekend, my friends and I jumped on a train to Rome, the Eternal City (*cue the Lizzie McGuire soundtrack*). As soon as we arrived, we headed across the river and up the hill to the Vatican City — home of Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel and Pieta, St. Peter’s Basilica, Stanze di Raffaello, and of course, the Pope.
Though Vatican City is the smallest country in the world, millions of people from all over flock to see the remarkable architecture, paintings and sculptures. Because it can get very crowded, you should book a tour with a guide before you arrive in order to skip the lengthy entrance line. After having marveled at all of the famous pieces of art on our tour, there was only one more activity to complete: climbing the 500+ narrow and spiraling steps to the top of the Cupola di San Pietro. Though it is a bit of a hike, the experience of taking in the 360-degree view of Vatican City and Rome is priceless.
Famished from the long day of walking, we headed to Campo de’ Fiori, a popular piazza for both Italians and Americans, serving as a market place during the day and a trendy spot for bars and restaurants at night. We came across a restaurant called “La Carbonara,” which specializes in a typical Roman dish, carbonara. Consisting of pasta, pancetta (Italian bacon), and an egg sauce, carbonara is a creamy pasta dish filled with a variety of savory flavors with a pinch of salt.

To make carbonara, there are four basic steps: first, cook the pasta in boiling water. Next, fry the pancetta in a pan, then beat egg yolk and cream together with some cheese, and last, combine all of the ingredients and serve with extra cheese. This heavy yet delicious meal energized us for all of the activities we had planned for the next day. For our second and final day, we explored the Coliseum (#fighton), the Roman Forum, the Pantheon, the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish steps.

To top it all off, I was lucky enough to discover one of my new favorite gelato shops in all of Italy near the Trevi Fountain called San Crispino — a must when visiting Rome. All in all, it was a weekend of famous works of art, ancient Roman buildings and, most importantly, delicious food.

XOXO,
Florentine Foodie
