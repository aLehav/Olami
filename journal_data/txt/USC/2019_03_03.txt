The Undergraduate Student Government unanimously passed a resolution on Feb. 19 to pilot the “Bringing in the Bystander” training on campus. The program seeks to prevent sexual misconduct by reaching out to campus organizations and educating third parties on how to approach different scenarios. 
While founded with good intentions, this initiative appears to be little more than damage control. It scapegoats bystanders with an unreasonable burden — and more importantly, it is a cop-out. USG is doing the bare minimum to address sexual harassment and assault on campus, when it should be doing more proactive and necessary legwork. 
Speaker Pro Tempore Matt Crane, co-chief diversity officer Shany Ebadi and two USG senators penned the resolution. Their first pilot training event took place on Feb. 23 and was attended by 40 student leaders, faculty and staff.
“We wanted to take a community-based approach to solve this problem and find out what our standards are as a community,” Crane said. “[The program] puts a lot of emphasis on talking through scenarios as a group, saying, ‘What should happen here?’” 
The general premise of the solution alone contains logical fallacies. Sexual misconduct is in no way a result of bystander passivity. When a sexual assault incident occurs, bystanders are only a side product of being in a given place at a given time. Sometimes, they have the power to intervene, but not always, and they are certainly not the solution to sexual misconduct. Rather than faulting the perpetrators of these crimes, this resolution absolves them and places the fault on those who happen to be near the incident.
Often, victims do not realize they are in a dangerous situation until it is too late. Given the nuances of these situations, it is unrealistic to expect uninvolved third parties to correctly judge a situation and the intentions of other individuals, much less intervene. 
The resolution places an irrational level of responsibility on the bystander, which oversimplifies the complexity of approaching sexual misconduct encounters.  
The resolution itself, while incomplete and inefficient, is by no means a negative initiative. Likening bystanders to watchdogs is fair. Expecting bystanders to speak out if and when they see someone who needs help is fair.However, this resolution was passed in the context of the administration’s own lack of effort — and that speaks volumes. 
“Especially now, we have seen little effort from administration,” said Jillian Halperin, one of the USG senators who penned the resolution.
This is not hard to imagine. Over the past few years, the student body has watched the University try — and fail — to sweep alleged scandals under the rug to save face: once with Keck School of Medicine’s former dean Carmen Puliafito, and again with former campus gynecologist George Tyndall, who is now at the center of LAPD’s largest alleged sex abuse investigation. It does not come as much of a surprise that the administration would rather protect its reputation than proactively address a controversial issue.
USG is openly facing pushback from the administration on these matters, and they are sitting down on such pushback. They are pushing forward a temporary solution to a long-term problem. Labeling bystanders as “key players” in preventing sexual assault is like putting a band-aid over a bullet-hole: It offers the illusion that something is getting done, when in fact no progress is being made.
It is USG’s job to fight for students, especially in the face of the administration’s self-serving motives. The truth, though, is that it is more convenient for USG to present the image of both proactivity and bureaucratic harmony. Its leaders want to appear as if they are tackling sexual misconduct on campus while maintaining good relations with administration. These individuals want the best of both worlds, but they have become pushovers because of it. 
As the organization unequivocally closest to the student body, USG should not keep such a safe distance from campus assault issues. They need to take the pushback and fight harder, actively opposing the precedent the administration has set on sexual misconduct. They represent every single student who sets foot on this campus, and this student body is too smart and too frustrated for complacency and pandering. Acquiescing to administrators is exactly how trust in well-meaning organizations is eroded and ultimately lost.

Imagine: No more misplaced TAP cards. No more fumbling around for quarters. No more grimacing at the bus driver and admitting you have no cash, only to be dismissed by a shake of the head and wave of the hand. Better yet, imagine actually riding the bus for free.
I’m sure that if public transit were free, we’d all be using it more. We’d be saving the environment, saving on gas costs and Lyft fees, saving Los Angeles from devolving deeper and deeper into the standstill traffic stereotype. So that’s exactly what the L.A. Metro must do: Make public transit free.
With careful planning, Metro can afford to do so. Metro’s 2017 Funding Sources Guide reports that in that year, Metro’s fare revenue totaled at $540.1 million from Metro rail and bus, non-Metro operator fares and Metrolink. When this fare revenue is stacked against Metro’s other sources of revenue, it proves to be not as much as it seems.
Metro is legally authorized to enact four sales tax initiatives — Propositions A and C and Measures M and R — which would impose a half-cent sales tax in Los Angeles County and would total $3.2 billion. The $540.1 million from fares pales in comparison. And there are still other local sources of revenue, such as the $410.5 million from the Transportation Development Act.
These numbers don’t even take federal and state funding into account. Federal and state funds are allocated by discretion, and because of the size and comprehensiveness of L.A.’s Metro, the city receives a high percentage of federal and state transportation funding. 
But $540 million won’t appear out of thin air. There are not many other immediate sources for funding, and with L.A.’s 2028 development goals in mind, there aren’t many expenditure cuts that can be made either. Though it seems like a move that is one step forward and two steps back, the city must increase taxes to fund transit. 
Though taxing cars on the freeways may be a setback for regular drivers, transportation officials are revisiting the idea again and again — it was even endorsed by the Chief Executive Officer of Metro. And these city leaders are right to rethink a congestion tax. Other cities are making it work. Since London enacted a congestion charge to enter its higher traffic area in 2003, entering traffic decreased by almost 40 percent during morning rush hour. 
Since then, London’s annual net revenue from transportation is about $216 million annually, according to a San Francisco County Transportation Authority comparison. If L.A. imposed a similar congestion tax and accrued that much revenue, the loss of revenue from fares would easily be balanced out.
Transportation officials are also considering taxes on ride-hailing services, electric scooters and shared bicycles. Metro approved a study to look into this additional tax on Thursday. If the investigation proves this tax to be beneficial, Metro will then pilot a tax on these vehicles in a few years. Anyone looking to ride a Spin scooter or take an Uber ride share will pay an additional fee to the usual rates on every single ride. This could dissuade use of these services and increase use of public transit. It would also provide L.A. more revenue to work with for transportation development.
But these investigations aren’t aggressive enough. Whether the end goal is reducing congestion or increasing development funding, someone needs to speak out about offering free transit. It’s unlikely the topic will even appear on city and transit planning agendas without a strong supporting voice. 
The Boston Globe published an op-ed at the end of January from Boston councilmember Michelle Wu, calling for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority to offer free public transit. She believes Bostonians’ quality of life would be greatly improved with free transit for all. With this piece, Wu emerges a champion for urbanists and public transit lovers all across the nation. Los Angeles needs a similar mindset — and someone to advocate for it.
Los Angeles is by far the most populated county in the United States. To implement free public transit would be a project for the next 10, 20 or 30 years.
“We need bold proposals to make public transit the most reliable, convenient and affordable transportation option,” Wu said.
With an election season around the corner and a promised reconsideration of current officials, policy and legislature — now is the time for bold proposals.

When Mozart’s La Clemenza di Tito premiered in 1791, there was one thing that most modern-day audiences would be shocked to hear about: The role of Sesto, a Roman patrician, was played by a castrato — a boy whose genitals had been cut off to maintain his high vocal register. The practice was common throughout Europe, after women were banned from singing on stage in the 16th century.
But 18th century audiences would also be shocked to see LA Opera’s 2019 production, which is radical . . . in a different way. Of course, Sesto is played by a mezzo-soprano woman instead of a castrato, but numerous roles are also played by performers of color, and the entire show reminds audience members that opera is not as old and dusty as the court of public opinion deems it. 
“The Clemency of Titus” is memorable on several fronts: Its cast is talented and diverse; its artistic design is borrowed straight from a painting in the Louvre and its passionate orchestra carries the show to new heights. Combine that with conductor James Conlon on the podium, and you have a tour de force that redefines the art form of opera for modern audiences. 
The absurdly complex plot of “The Clemency of Titus” begins with Vitellia (Guanqun Yu) convincing her admirer Sesto (Elizabeth DeShong) to murder the Roman Emperor Titus (Russell Thomas). Vitelia, whose (former emperor) father was murdered by Titus’ father, wants the throne for herself, and she’ll do anything to get it — even if that means manipulating Sesto with the promise of marriage. 
Meanwhile, after Titus basically banishes the woman he had courted to marry (it’s complicated), he attempts to marry Servilia (Janai Brugger), who also happens to be Sesto’s sister. Servelia declines the offer, so Titus asks Vitelia for her hand. 
By this point Vitelia and Sesto have already paused and restarted their murder plans, further complicating the opera’s plot, since Sesto is now on a mission to murder Vitellia’s future husband, who he thinks is her mortal enemy. 
The three leading characters, played by Yu, DeShong and Thomas, balance each other perfectly. Thomas champions his role with pure ferocity. It makes sense that Titus’ subjects think he is a divine ruler, because that voice took the audience to church. 
DeShong does a remarkable job filling in for an 18th-century castrato. DeShong has the most material in the show but delivers it with ease and a voice that sounds the way velvet feels. She and Taylor Raven — who plays the young patrician Annio — both exhibit refined physical character work as first-century noblemen. 
And Yu holds her own as the bloodthirsty villainess. Her full soprano sound — even from the top to the bottom of her range — stood out from every other singer, making her a joy to listen to.
Director and set designer Thaddeus Strassberger brought the perfect sense of cohesion to both of his roles, which made the two and a half hours fly by. The blocking was simple yet effective, allowing the ensemble to bring Mozart’s score to life without unnecessary frills. 
Mattie Ullrich’s costume design brings the perfect touch of whimsy to the production with bold colors and a 25 foot-long train (worn by Guanqun Yu at the end of the show). The costumes worn by the chorus, including headband halos and ornate gladiator helmets, pulled the story together aesthetically. 
The show’s plot, despite its complexity, is made clear with the cast and creative team’s expertise. The mercy that Emperor Titus shows to those around him is an example anyone can learn from — in any year. And LA Opera puts diversity at the forefront of its new production, painting a vision for opera’s future. 
LA Opera’s “The Clemency of Titus” runs through March 24. Tickets are available through LA Opera’s website.

My favorite artist in high school was the Christian rock band Skillet. Over the course of two years, I convinced my parents to let me see Skillet five times, and I collected many of its studio albums. I followed Skillet’s tour diaries religiously, and at one point, I got into a fight at church over fan trivia that I had to prove I knew better. I look back on this period of my life fondly, even after I realized the music wasn’t as good as I had once believed. 
As someone who gets anxious whenever I have to choose what I want for lunch, being so open and proud about my favorite band was a rare part of my life where I actually gained confidence. I was the textbook definition of a fangirl, and it was fun. 
There’s a certain image and description that comes to mind when the word “fangirl” is thrown around. When the fangirl’s favorite artist puts out a new song, she’s already got a million theories about what the album will be about, based on obscure clues the artist may or may not have threaded together for months. 
She’s the first one to purchase tickets with her presale code after waiting on Ticketmaster for hours before the official on-sale time. She’s in the front row of the pit holding a sign over her head while she jumps in time to the warble of the bass. She knows every lyric of every song — even the B-sides and rarities.
But there’s also a side of the fangirl’s music fandom that can be problematic. There’s the fanfiction pairing up her favorite members of a band together or inserting herself as the object of their affection. It’s harmless fun, until that band member gets a girlfriend who immediately receives a barrage of death threats from total strangers. 
The endless fan accounts on social platforms, which chronicle their favorite celebrity’s every move in copious detail, aren’t bad until the accounts take it upon themselves to determine which fans are real and which are irrelevant.
It’s useful to me to separate the toxic parts of music fandom from the healthy parts, by labelling the latter as fandom and the former as “stan” culture. “Stanning,” as a concept, can be traced back to the year 2000, when Eminem launched his magnum opus “The Marshall Mathers LP.” One of the standouts, a personal favorite of mine, is “Stan,” a song that deconstructs toxic fandom in four verses. By the end of verse three, the titular Stan is so incensed by Eminem’s lack of communication that he throws his pregnant girlfriend into the back of his car and drives off a bridge. 
Stan felt he understood Eminem better than anyone else in the world, and that deep understanding earned him the right to all of Eminem’s time and attention. While I might put out that I stan an artist from time to time, I also understand the history behind that term and how most self-declared stans behave. 
While it’s important to acknowledge that many of Stan’s behaviors in the song ring eerily true about what stans look like in 2019: They are a small but vocal subset of a large body of fans. What’s interesting to me is how Eminem envisioned the epitome of toxic fandom as a white man in the song, yet overtime we’ve associated it with young girls. 
Wasn’t it mostly white men who felt their unique understanding of Star Wars entitled them to send Kelly Marie Tran death threats, until they forced her to deactivate her Instagram? Wasn’t it mostly white men who harassed Leslie Jones because they didn’t want her ruining their Ghostbusters franchise? Why then do we label girls as the main proponents of toxicity in music fandom when every other fan community provides evidence for another culprit?
What I feel is most harmful about this attitude is the message sent when we discount artists entirely because of their “teenage, screaming fangirls.” 
Deciding something isn’t good when a girl likes it lets those girls know their interests aren’t valued the way a man’s is. Their opinion isn’t rational or important enough to count, so when expressed, it is ignored or used as a marker for what not to believe or like. It has become acceptable to diminish a girl’s passion to her age and alleged lack of emotional maturity. She is not taken seriously, so the object of her interest is not either.
Stan culture is not exclusive to music (I think it’s worse in anime fandom), but musicians are often at the forefront of our collective consciousness. If we buy into it, we are the ones who are ignorant — not the girls who love and feel with conviction, who should instead be lauded. It’s their passion that sells tickets and albums, that racks up streams on Spotify and determines which artist is on top. 
They are the pulse of the music industry. It’s time they received their due recognition.

Freshman and sophomore students at the Kaufman School of Dance performed their mid-semester showcase Saturday. 
Directed by choreographer and assistant professor Bruce McCormick, the event included five pieces of varying composition and tone. These pieces mostly featured set choreography from master choreographers, but one, titled “Material from ‘Whelm,’” included choreography created by the Kaufman class of 2022 in collaboration with Bret Easterling, a lecturer at Kaufman. 
Other pieces were “Symphony of Psalms,” originally performed by the Netherlands Dance Theater in 1978; “Delicate Balance,” choreographed by Jodie Gates, “Lickety Split,” a piece featured in the 2018 mid-semester Kaufman showcase and an excerpt from “Monger,” originally performed at the Suzanne Dellal Dance Centre in Tel Aviv. 
The five pieces offered diversity in both style and form. “Delicate Balance,” a piece focusing on weight and lifting, highlighted the push and pull among multiple dancers moving synchronously. It was immediately followed and juxtaposed by “Material from ‘Whelm,’” which was fast-paced and featured multiple solos. Through the wide variety of dances, the audience witnessed the vast skill repertoire of the students. McCormick noted this method’s significance.
“We pride ourselves on our hybridity,” McCormick said. “That’s what really makes Kaufman unique and we try to bring in a repertoire that really showcases the versatility and hybridity of the students.” 
Another highlight of the evening was “Lickety Split,” which featured  three female and three male dancers. This extended piece told three separate but parallel love stories, each portraying different emotions of desire, yearning, intimacy and joy. At the end of the piece, all six dancers joined one another onstage. The focus shifted to the group and their movements, as solo dancers stepped out to the front of the stage to highlight their individual talent. Professor Thomas McManus, who assisted in the staging of “Delicate Balance,” spoke about the dance techniques featured in “Lickety Split.”
“Lickety Split’ is about a kind of grounded-ness,” McManus said. “And sometimes there are gestures that are ‘thrown away’ — we say ‘thrown away’ in dance, which means that you don’t execute them perfectly and with a kind of intent. They’re a little bit more unconscious, almost.” 
The mid-semester showcase displayed the students’ hard work and discipline. They will now continue their practice as they begin preparing for the final showcase in April.

Solange has been breaking barriers. Since the release of her first studio album, “Solo Star,” the artist has sparked national conversations about blackness in America, and her style has evolved with a smooth upward progression toward the beautifully indescribable sound experiment that is her latest album. 
With Friday’s release of “When I Get Home,” Solange provides a soundtrack to the narratives of African Americans underrepresented in the music industry. After her 2016 Grammy-winning album “A Seat at the Table” made her a household name, it’s undeniable that “When I Get Home” should make Solange a bonafide cultural icon. 
“When I Get Home” and “A Seat at the Table” solidified Solange’s unique style in the canon of popular music. Not quite jazz, not quite funk, not quite R&B, Solange is in a genre of her own. Similar to her last album, she makes the most of a few lyrics that she repeats, pulling forward the music’s intention without overcomplicating the narrative. 
The album is so sonically cohesive that the transitions between songs are often unclear, unless the listener is actively watching the playback bar. As each song seamlessly blends into the next, she and her featured artists — including rapper Gucci Mane and singer Sampha — begin to recount the black narrative of Houston. 
“My Skin My Logo” — which features Gucci Mane and Tyler, the Creator — makes the political personal, painting the commodification of black skin as the product of a culture obsessed with branding and appearance. 
Unlike “A Seat at the Table,” which featured standalone hits like “Cranes in the Sky” and “Don’t Touch My Hair,” “When I Get Home” is one full narrative arc that avoids the formalities associated with most albums in 2019 (no singles were released in advance, and the album had basically no pre-release publicity). 
Beyond its creativity and eclectic style, however, the true highlight of Solange’s new album is her voice. On “Time (is),” her soft tone spirals downward and upward, backed by gorgeously simple piano chords. Solange repeats the words “you’ve gotta know” at least 17 times, but the song’s ethereal sound embraces the listener so tightly that it blends together to create a long lullaby. 
And even though the album may present itself as one cohesive tour de force, one can’t help but latch on to some of its best tracks. “Almeda,” which features rapper Playboi Carti, references the area near Houston where Solange grew up. In the beginning of the song, Solange sings “pour my drank, drank / sip, sip, sip, sip, sip,” referencing “purple lean” (a drink typically made with cough syrup), which originated in Houston but is popular throughout the hip-hop community. 
“Almeda” also speaks about black faith and its ability to endure the passage of time. 
“Black faith still can’t be washed away,” she sings. “Not even in that Florida water.” 
Florida water references two things in this song, the first being the holy water often used in various African traditions to cleanse others and the second being the unisex cologne, Florida Water, which she uses to attest to the strength of black men. Solange carried a bottle of the cologne as she walked the red carpet at the 2018 Met Gala. 
It is time to admit that Solange is an artist in her own right, uniquely separate from her superstar sister Beyoncé. “When I Get Home” is a testament to not only her talent as a visual storyteller but also her cultural importance as a mainstream voice in the black community. It is safe to say that 16 years after the release of her debut “Solo Star,” the Houston native is now more than just a “solo star.” Rather, she has become one of the most important storytellers of our generation.

The USC men’s volleyball team beat Pepperdine 3-1 at Galen Center Saturday night in a convincing four-set contest. The Trojans rose to 3-3 against Mountain Pacific Sports Federation opponents and 9-7 on the season.
The Trojans entered the match ranked No. 13 in the nation, while Pepperdine came in as the favorite at No. 4. That said, the Trojans proved that they were not intimidated in the slightest, taking a 10-6 lead early in the first set, a deficit from which the Waves were never able to recover. USC secured the first set by a healthy margin of 25-19.
At first, the second set appeared to mirror the first. The Trojans got out to an early 11-5 lead and held onto that margin as each team traded point for point. USC was up 18-13 when the Waves began to fight their way back, however, eventually tying the Trojans at 22 points apiece. After some more back-and-forth action, Pepperdine was able to capture the second set 27-25.
The third set began differently. USC was able to open with a 4-1 lead because of sophomore setter Chris Hall’s serves, but Pepperdine quickly clawed its way back as the teams went blow-for-blow throughout the remainder of the set. The Trojans were ultimately able to take the set with a 3-point run that was capped off by an impressive kill from senior co-captain Jack Wyett.
The final set was arguably USC’s most convincing performance of the four. The teams were tied 16-16 when the Trojans began to make their move. USC took the next 2 points, conceded 1 and then took the next 4, finding themselves up 22-17. The Waves were unable to overcome that deficit and the Trojans emerged victorious with a score of 25-20.
USC was led by senior co-captains Wyett and outside hitter Ryan Moss, who touted 16 kills and 21 kills, respectively. Moss also contributed an impressive 12 digs in the match. Fellow senior outside hitter Gianluca Grasso added 15 kills and 9 digs of his own.
Senior libero Matt Douglass earned 17 digs, a match high for either team, while sophomore setter Chris Hall set up his teammates with 42 assists and also got the crowd jumping with a highly impressive ace in the early moments of the third set.
Sophomore middle blocker Kyle Gear provided an astounding six blocks against the Waves high-powered offense, helping to hold them to just .256 hitting. As Hall mentioned after the match, the Trojans clearly did their homework in preparation for the Waves.
“The [coaching staff] did a really good job of scouting for the match,” Hall said. “One of their big [outside hitters], Dave Wieczork… hits a lot of cross court, but we made that adjustment early … I think shutting him down was really good.” 
When asked about how the team has performed in matches against highly-ranked programs, Hall took a mindful approach about how best to move forward.
“We just need to go out and value every point,” he said. “Sometimes we get caught up in the result, but we just need to focus on the process.”
The sophomore setter also spoke about the feeling of coming away with a MPSF victory.
“Obviously, tonight was a really good win,” Hall said. “We had a close one against Concordia a few nights ago, but … we know that we’re a really good team and we can compete at the top of the MPSF.” 
In regard to the upcoming non-conference matches, Hall made it clear the team shouldn’t be comfortable with its victory over Pepperdine.	
“We had a big win against the No. 4 team in the country … but we could easily lose to Penn State or Ohio State if we don’t bring our [A-game], so we just need to go into this practice week with a good mindset and keep working hard [and] scouting well,” he said.
Although it appears the team won’t be taking much time to celebrate its win, Saturday’s match was certainly a major victory for the Trojans who will look to add to their momentum this weekend.
The team will take part in the Pac-12/Big Ten Challenge this week. The Trojans will host Penn State Friday and Ohio State Saturday at Galen Center.

Bryce Harper had 330 million reasons to spend the next 13 years in Philadelphia. Manny Machado had 300 million reasons to take the freeway down to San Diego. Nolan Arenado had 260 million reasons to stay in Denver.
In the span of a week — after an off-season of stagnancy and quality players remaining on the market — we saw record contracts posted across the board in Major League Baseball. Arenado stayed with the Rockies and became the highest-paid position player per year at nearly $33 million, Machado became the first to eclipse the $300 million mark with the Padres and Harper went to the Phillies with the largest contract for a baseball player — ever. 
Together, the three contracts add up to nearly $900 million, which is equivalent to the value of the entire Tampa Bay Rays franchise, and, for some reason, the net worth of Kylie Jenner. 
So what makes these players worthy of Kardashian-level wealth? Obviously, the ability to hit a baseball very well and very far. There are few players in baseball that induce a buzz over the crowd when they step up to the plate. You pay to watch generational talents like Harper, Machado and Arenado go up to bat. You buy their jerseys, vote them onto All-Star teams, marvel at their skillsets.
From that perspective, it is easy to defend an owner handing over a fortune to entice a superstar to join or stay with a franchise. The capability to puff out their chests and say, “You’re damn right: I’m rich beyond imagination, we just signed Bryce Harper, and your team didn’t,” is powerful. It is a franchise-changing, legacy-defining decision that forever links owner to player, player to city and owner to city. 
The catch-22, though, is this: None of those players are worth the contracts they signed. Not even close. They might be if you add sponsorships, endorsements and other extracurricular funds. But $330 million in guaranteed money, to swing a bat? For 13 years? Come on. 
In 13 years, Bryce Harper will be 39 years old. Think about how old you will be and what you might be doing in 13 years. Imagine it’s the year 2031 — four presidential election cycles later — Harper will still be making $23.5 million on the same contract he signed in 2019. Somebody born today will be a teenager before Harper stops reeling in checks. This contract is going to hit puberty. 
Harper will not be worth $23.5 million at the end his contract. Machado will not be worth $30 million a year at 36 years old and neither will a 34-year-old Arenado. But they are not being paid to be good in their late 30s. They are being paid to be good now. To have their services in their prime years, teams are willing to overpay tremendously in the latter years. 
At best, this is instant gratification. At worst, it is reckless decision-making. When you break the bank for one player, when you push all your chips into the center of the table and lean on one person to make it all pay off, it is a wild gamble. Injuries happen. Issues arise. The unexpected occurs, and suddenly all is lost. And yeah, when players get older, they are no longer as good. There is no insurance plan, no backup, no waiver. A 39-year-old Bryce Harper will make $23.5 million, whether he is still an MVP-caliber player or a benchwarmer who can no longer hit. 
And here is the thing: Do you think Harper really wanted to sign with the Phillies? Was there something so special about Philadelphia that he could not see himself elsewhere? He reportedly had lucrative offers from the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers to live in California, be rich and play baseball. But the proposals were not as good as $330 million for 13 years. Simply put, Harper waited past the Winter Meetings, past the new year, past the start of spring training and into the last day of February for a team desperate and stupid enough to offer him a deal he could not resist. Good for him. Shame on the team. 
For Harper, that team was the Phillies. For Machado, it was the Padres. Both franchises were eager to attract star talent, to draw attention and to bring fans to the stadium. Never mind that for $300 or $330 million, they could have signed three or four different free agents who might collectively provide more value than one player alone — with the added benefit that if one of those players suffers a career-threatening injury, the franchise isn’t over. 
But doing that is not as sexy as adding a Harper or a Machado. And so, here begins an unnecessary, decade-plus roll of the dice. Good luck with that.

The women’s lacrosse team split games on a road trip to Boston this weekend. The Trojans lost their first game Friday against No. 1 Boston College 12-9 but bounced back Sunday to defeat Boston University 16-11.
At Newton Field, the Trojans fell behind Boston College early. The game started slow, with neither team looking sharp. The high-powered Boston College offense would not be held quiet for long, though. After five scoreless minutes, they jumped out to a 3-0 lead in a matter of only 90 seconds. At the start of the game, USC looked somewhat shell-shocked. The Trojans committed too many unforced turnovers against a team that capitalizes on opponents’ mistakes better than any team in the NCAA.
Transition was where the Trojans lost the game. Boston College’s tight defense forced a few too many errant throws, and the Eagles were able to take advantage of these fast-break opportunities to score swift and relatively easy goals. 
The game could have gotten out of hand fast, but the stout USC defense kept the team in the game. Sophomore goalie Riley Hertford stepped up with eight saves and career highs of six ground balls and three caused turnovers. 
At the end of a sluggish first half, USC was down 5 goals to the best team in the nation. The Trojans made a spirited comeback, scoring 7 of the final 12 goals. However, the hole proved too difficult for the team to climb out of by the end of the game. 
The second-half comeback halted with a little more than 13 minutes left when senior defender and team captain Jackie Gilbert drew a yellow card. While in the penalty box, Boston College scored 1 goal and gained valuable possessions to slow down the Trojans’ momentum.
For the Eagles, senior attacker Sam Apuzzo totaled 7 points on 5 goals and two assists. She scored or assisted on 3 of the first 5 goals of the game for Boston College. 
Eagles graduate student attacker Kenzie Kent was another major problem for the Trojans. Kent  played the role of distributor, assisting on 6 goals and scoring 1.
The goal that epitomized the game for USC came with just under six minutes to go in the first half. The Eagles were deep into the shot clock, and the Trojan defense was all over the field, making things difficult for the Eagles’ attack. With nine seconds left on the shot clock, Boston College junior midfielder Cara Urbank drilled an acrobatic shot from her knees. 
No matter what the Trojans did, the Eagles always seemed to have an answer. 
Despite the loss to the Eagles, USC beat Boston University on Sunday at Nickerson Field. Against the Terriers, the Huff family got the job done, as sisters Kelsey and Kaeli Huff scored 4 goals each.
Junior midfielder Kaeli Huff had a very clean game, shooting 4-for-4 with a ground ball and two caused turnovers. Sophomore midfielder Kelsey Huff shot 4-for-9 with an assist and a caused turnover.
The Trojans never trailed the Terriers despite losing the draw control battle 17-12. Head coach Lindsey Munday could not find a way to help her team win the draw.
When it was clear that Gilbert was not getting the job done, Munday sent in the young guns. Freshman midfielder Erin Bakes took a few draws, but Munday eventually settled on freshman midfielder Katie Ramsey. Ramsey had the most success of the two newcomers, winning three draws. 
The victory at Boston University marks the second time the Trojans have won a game in Massachusetts. They were previously 0-5.
Pac-12 play starts for the Trojans next week, as they hit the road to face Arizona State Friday.

The Trojan women’s basketball team ended the regular season on a high note with two weekend victories. The first came in an 84-77 victory over Colorado at Galen Center Friday night, followed by an 83-77 overtime win against Utah. 
Colorado started off hot, taking a 12-6 lead in the first five minutes of regulation. Sophomore guard Mya Hollingshed scored 10 of the first 12 points for Colorado. Scoring from guards junior Minyon Moore and senior Aliyah Mazyck matched the Buffaloes’ run early, and a 3-pointer from junior forward Ja’Tavia Tapley tied the game at 12. At the end of the quarter, the score was 21-17 Colorado. 
With .06 seconds left in the half, Moore inbounded to Mazyck, who tipped in a last second buzzer-beater to bring the lead to 39-30 by the half. USC finished the half on a 10-0 run. 
Junior forward Kayla Overbeck returned from a first-quarter leg injury to add 6 points in the second half, as the Trojans extended their lead to 12. After a quick 5-1 run, Colorado senior guard Alexis Robinson hit a 3-pointer to bring the Trojan lead down to single-digits. 
USC held its lead for the entirety of the fourth quarter, and a quick run from the Buffaloes in the last minute was not enough to take the win from the Trojans.
Mazyck finished with a game-high 30 points on 10-of-16 shooting, hitting 5-of-6 shots from beyond the arc. The Trojans forced 15 turnovers, which they converted into 27 points. 
USC finished the regular season Sunday at home against Utah with a thrilling 83-77 overtime victory. Mazyck, Mariya Moore and forwards Cheyanne Wallace and Marguerite Effa were honored on Senior Day in their last home game as Trojans. 
It was a low-scoring first quarter, as Minyon Moore scored the first points of the contest on a layup with six minutes remaining in the period. The Trojan defense swarmed the Utes, causing 10 turnovers in the first quarter. 
Both teams continued to struggle offensively in the second quarter, combining for 2-for-25 from the field until a three from graduate student guard Sarah Porter put the Utes up 22-18. Mazyck walked off the court with a leg injury before the last possession of the half and did not return. A Minyon Moore layup at the buzzer made the score 26-23 Utah at the half. 
The game opened up in the second half, as evidenced by USC’s 23 points in the fourth quarter, matching its first half output. In the last minute of regulation, the score was 62-58 Utah. 
However, the Trojans wouldn’t quit, as a quick step-back three from Mariya Moore and two free throws from Minyon Moore brought their deficit down to two. Utah went 1-for-2 from the line after being intentionally fouled and Mariya Moore hit another 3-pointer to make the score 67-66 Utah.
Utah senior guard Erika Bean stepped to the line and made the front end of a one-and-one, but missed the second. In the ensuing scrum for the rebound, USC freshman guard Desiree Caldwell was fouled. On the other end of the floor, she hit two clutch free throws that tied the game 68-68, and the game went to overtime.
“To be down by [4] with 50 seconds to go in the game, the team didn’t quit,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “The kids showed huge heart.” 
The teams traded blows to start the overtime period. With just over two minutes remaining, Minyon Moore picked up her fifth personal foul, ending her night. 
Redshirt freshman guard Shalexxus Aaron’s fifth three of the night put the Trojans up 3 but was quickly answered by a three from Utah senior forward Megan Huff at the top of the key to tie the game at 77 with one minute to go. 
Overbeck and Caldwell contributed perfect trips to the line, and the Trojan defense got two straight stops, putting USC up 81-77 with 16 seconds left. Caldwell’s last trip to the line secured the victory for USC.
“I know in overtime my legs were shaking,” Mariya Moore said, “So for [Desiree] to come in clutch like that was great.”
The Moore sisters combined for 43 points, while Aaron added 17, including five 3-pointers. 
USC finished the season 17-12 and 7-11 in the Pac-12. The conference tournament begins Thursday in Las Vegas.
“We’re the underdogs,” Mariya Moore said of the tournament. “But honestly, I love being the underdogs more. You surprise people. We’re excited, and we’re not ready for the season to be over.”

Qiming Wang and his team first noticed organic cells’ ability in human and animal organs to self-heal while looking through microscopes. Eight months later, the assistant professor, along with three graduate students and a professor from the University of Connecticut, is building upon that discovery with self-repairing shoelaces and tires.
Wang, graduate students Kun-Hao Yu, An Xin, Haixu Du and University of Connecticut assistant professor Ying Li used 3-D printing to make the materials for mass production.
According to Wang, the team found inspiration for the project while looking at the properties of complex organic molecules in animal organs. Self-healing materials had existed before, but were never able to be produced en masse.
“Some animal organs … have very complicated structure or geometry, and also, when you have wounds or fractures, it can autonomously self-heal,” Wang said. “The existing engineering material probably, they are self-healing materials … but most of the healing materials cannot be 3-D printed into complicated structures.” 
The self-healing material is made through a process called curing, which changes the properties of polymer material and makes it tougher. According to Yu, the material starts off as a liquid in a 2-D shape and is then shot with beams of light to solidify it. Then, the researchers 3-D print the structure layer by layer.
While creating the material, the team ran into some difficulties developing its chemical structure. Wang said they had trouble designing the self-healing molecules in a way that also allowed for 3-D printing.
“Basically you need to design a material [that] can be 3-D printed and also can be self-healable,” Wang said. “So how to balance these properties in a single material is a key obstacle.”  
According to Yu, it took eight months of research before they were able to make the material account for both self-healing and 3-D printing properties. 
“We finally find the correct amount of the [chemical] we need,” Yu said. “And then we find a very good ratio [for] a rapid 3-D printing time, and also … good healing efficiency.” 
Wang said he is hopeful for future applications of this material, which he wants to market to both civilians and the government. The team plans to begin with the shoewear and tire industry.
“The most immediate application is footwear,” Wang said. “So actually after our paper [was] published a number of footwear companies contacted us, including Reebok, Red Wing Shoes … their vision is … to push out shoes that are self-healable.” 
According to Wang, research to create self-healing shoes and tires will take two to three years. After implementation, these products will be available on retail market.
The study is funded by Air Force Office of Scientific Research Young Investigator Program and the National Science Foundation, which hopes to produce military armor and vehicle alterations.
“[The Air Force] funded our research because they want to 3-D print airplane wings in the future, and …  soldier armor, and make those structures self-healable,” Wang said. “When you have bullets coming in, or you have damage … or impact, it [will] self-heal.” 
The team plans to create self-healing uniforms and other applications in the military. However, Wang said military implementation will take several years to achieve. He said getting approval could take up to 10 years.
The team already has a patent on their production process and is planning on continuing their research until commercial use is possible, Yu said.

The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear USC’s petition regarding whether  or not the University can settle a retirement dispute outside the court in February. With the denial, the case will default to a lower court decision that the dispute can be handled in court.
Nine current and former University employees will be able to settle their case against USC retirement plans in court, despite signed arbitration agreements from some employees that required them to handle individual disputes in private meetings.
The decision reaffirms a ruling in July by the United States Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The ruling stated that the arbitration agreements employees signed did not require employees to handle their disputes outside of court because they brought the claims on their own behalves. Previously, the Los Angeles district judge also ruled against handling the case through arbitration.
“The panel concluded that the dispute fell outside the scope of the arbitration agreements because the parties consented only to arbitrate claims brought on their own behalf, and the employees’ claims were brought on behalf of the [Employee Retirement Income Security Act] plans,” the opinion from the appeals court read. 
The American Association of Retired Persons submitted an amicus curiae brief, a piece written by a person or group who are not party to the case but would like to influence the court decision. The brief urged the ninth circuit court to uphold the Los Angeles court’s decision to deny arbitration.
“AARP and the AARP Foundation are gratified that the appeals court’s ruling remains the law of the land in this circuit,” AARP vice president for litigation Dean Graybill wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “Congress in ERISA intended to give pension plan members ready access to the courts for claimed breaches of fiduciary duty, and the Ninth Circuit’s opinion preserves that access.” 
The lawsuit originally filed against the University in 2016 states that changes made that March removed one of USC’s four recordkeepers and cut its investment options for employees and retirees from 340 to 34. Jerry Schlichter, the lawyer representing the nine current and former USC employees, said the University allegedly charged employees excessive fees as part of their retirement plans and allowed investment firms with low performance histories to be included as options in their plans. 
“The employer, USC, has the obligation to work [for] the sole benefit of the employees and retirees,” Schlichter said. “It is held to the standard of an expert in the financial world because they’re investing very substantial sums and are charged with knowing what fees should be charged. 
The University, which is represented by the Gibson Dunn law firm, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. 
Law firm Schlichter, Bogard & Denton represents the USC employees and retirees and is involved in similar cases against Northwestern University, Cornell University and Columbia University among others. 
“What we have found is that some, but certainly not all universities, have operated for decades as if they’re not covered by the law that requires them to act for the sole benefit of their employees,” Schlichter said.  
Following the Supreme Court’s denial, the lawsuit will now proceed through the Los Angeles court system. Schlichter said the goal of the suit is to compensate past employees and retirees for alleged excessive fees and losses from investment firms that shouldn’t have been included in the plan. He said the law firm will work to determine the amount of compensation past employees and retirees should receive.

The Daily Trojan won a total of 22 awards from the California College Media Association Saturday at its annual awards ceremony in La Jolla, including eight first-place honors.
The newspaper took home top recognition in the Best Special Issue/Section category for “Home Away From Home,” a collection of features about housing at USC; Best News Series for “Speck of Green,” which focuses on the University’s sustainability efforts; and Best Podcast for “Engemann’s Attempts to Rebuild Trust,” an episode from the “General Education” news podcast. 
The Daily Trojan also won first place for its editorial board, “We will not allow USC to censor student voices.” The opinion piece was written after a University spokesperson prevented a Daily Trojan reporter from covering a town hall event centered on USC’s presidential search.
Other first place awards included Best Non-News Video (“De España para el mundo”), Best Sports Story (“Just keep shootin’: Bennie Boatwright’s work ethic and patience have him primed for success”), Best Infographic (“USC Teaching Garden”) and Best Interactive Graphic (“A Closer Look: Popular Student Housing Complexes”). 
“We are extremely humbled to be recognized for our work,” Editor-in-Chief Allen Pham said. “Despite the limitations we face as a student-run newspaper, our top priority has always been to telling the stories of our campus and community. Student journalism continues to thrive and we are incredibly proud to be a part of this movement.”
The Daily Trojan placed second in six categories: Best Breaking News Story (“Nikias to resign as USC president after year defined by scandals”), Best Multimedia Presentation (“Home Away from Home”), Best Use of Social Media for A Single Story (“No Longer Welcome”), Best Social Media Platform (Twitter), Best Newspaper Website and Best Mobile Site.
Third-place awards included Best Feature Story (“After Tyndall, USC leaders are restructuring the health center to regain trust”), Best Newspaper Column (“In support of the city’s famed ‘dirty dog’ vendors”), Best Newspaper Inside Page Design (“Accessibility reigns at West Jefferson taco shop”), Best Photo Series (“Ben Shapiro speaks at USC”) and Best Sports Photograph.
The Daily Trojan also received honorable mentions for Best News Video (“Gakusei House: A place to call home”), Best Photo Illustration and Best Arts and Entertainment Story (“Magic on Menlo: The Making of Moontower”).
“Our paper’s proven its prowess in a wide variety of traditional and multimedia categories this year at the CCMAs,” Daily Trojan Associate Managing Editor Karan Nevatia said. “These awards not only make our staff proud, but motivate us to continue to report, write and tell stories at the highest level of excellence.”

A resolution urging USC to cut ties with Palos Verdes-based Terranea Resort was presented on the Undergraduate Student Government Senate floor during a meeting Tuesday. 
Sen. Michaela Murphy, Director of External Affairs Alec Vandenberg and the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation co-authored the resolution, which requests that USC revoke sponsorships, conferences and hotel bookings from the resort in light of allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct from eight women during their employment at the hotel.  
“Financially and otherwise affiliating with the Terranea Resort compromises the Undergraduate Student Government mission ‘to seek and obtain effective communication and relations within the University and external communities,’” the resolution states. “Affiliating with Terranea Resort compromises USC’s policy in its mission statement to ‘serve the public interest.’” 
SC Sports Properties, a division of FOX Sports Media Group and Home Team Sports, is listed as an official partner of the resort. Since 2012, USC Athletics has used the resort for retreats and conferences. The Keck School of Medicine also hosts programming and events at the resort.
Vandenberg said he learned about the now settled allegations against the resort after reading a Daily Trojan report on protesters from a hotel workers’ union urging USC to cut ties with the resort.
“I originally saw the article … and a little bit less than a week after that I heard from Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation and they connected with a UNITE HERE Local Union 11 representative,” Vandenberg said.
Murphy said students should be aware of where USC’s money goes and the organizations the University financially supports.
“As students who fund the institution of USC … and generally where we put our money matters,” Murphy said. “What we fund and how we fund it is obviously a reflection of our values and there is no reason why at minimum we shouldn’t have a conversation more broadly and take a deeper look at the organizations and institutions that we tie ourselves to.” 
Former Terranea employee Sandra Pezqueda filed a lawsuit against the resort, alleging she was sexually assaulted by her superior. After the news gained national attention, TIME Magazine named Pezqueda one of the “Silence Breakers” in  2017. It was later settled in May 2018. However, the resort continues to face opposition from the public. 
UNITE HERE Local 11, a union representing over 30,000 workers in Southern California, is a partner of #MeTooTerranea, which is calling on organizations and individuals to boycott the resort.
“We want to do out part to pressure USC to disaffiliate,” Vandenberg said. “We want to apply a … pressure to USC in the immediate term until we see a lot of structural changes that we want to see at the resort.” 
The resolution, which is supported by SCALE and the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, outlines several reforms Terranea Resort must implement for USC to reestablish ties with the hotel. The resolution states that the resort ought to compensate survivors of “abuse and intimidation,” reform its human resource protocols and terminate hotel management who “have been complicit” in the allegations. 
“The resolution was largely driven by a student-run campaign within the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation,” wrote Ariella Amit, a SCALE member and sophomore majoring in urban studies and planning, in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “I supported the students who wrote it and continue to advocate for the importance of student voices and opposition to USC’s ties with Terranea Resort.” 
If passed, the resolution will be presented to various University administrators such as Keck Medicine of USC CEO Thomas E. Jackiewicz, Keck School of Medicine Dean Laura Mosqueda, Athletic Director Lynn Swann, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry, Provost Michael Quick and Interim President Wanda Austin.
“We want to make it a collaborative conversation and have this level of coalition building across organizations on campus,” Murphy said. “But, also being strong and firm in our response that USC should not be continuing its relationship with an organization that is shown to allegedly abuse its workers.” 
Amit wants the University to listen to student voices and re-evaluate its partnership with the hotel.
“I hope [that] USC will not only hear, but also more importantly listen to the students demanding that the administration ends its complicity in occurrences of sexual assault both on campus and in any institutions with which USC partners,” Amit said. 
Vandenberg hopes the resolution will reach USC administrators. 
“We wanted to make sure we included the appropriate and relevant heads of departments that are associated with Terranea Resort,” Vandenberg said. “Whether that’s Athletics [or] whether that’s Keck … we also just wanted to make sure by identifying them in the resolution, the assumption is that it will arrive on their desk and at the very least start a conversation.” 
Though the suit was settled last May and the hotel was dismissed as a party to the suit, UNITE HERE Local 11 continues its boycott efforts against the resort. The union has come under fire, however, for allegedly using scare and intimidation tactics to recruit Terranea workers, according to the campaign EyesOn11. 
“I am aware of those counter allegations,” Vandenberg said. “My understanding is that these workers are currently not unionized and that some of them do want to unionize … but many of them have been threatened by Terranea Resort …. for being outspoken … Also let me be clear that the boycott effort is  sponsored by a lot of different organizations.” 
Vandenberg said he encourages students to pressure the University administration not because student are “pawns of a union,” but rather because he hopes USC will be more transparent.
