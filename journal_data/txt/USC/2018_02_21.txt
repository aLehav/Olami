Voter turnout to this year’s Undergraduate Student Government election dropped by 12.66 percent from last year, according to information released at the USG Senate meeting on Tuesday.
Compared to 5,411 voters in 2017, only 4,627 students cast their ballots in this year’s election. Debbie Lee and Blake Ackerman won the presidential election with 2,276 votes, representing 49.19 percent of total votes, while Mai Mizuno and Brianna Bozek received 2,161 votes, or 46.7 percent. The remaining 190 votes were abstentions. From Feb. 13-16, students voted both online and in person at various stations on campus, including a new polling booth at  USC Village.
“I chose to vote in this election because I wanted to do my part as an undergraduate in selecting who represents our values and desires best,” said Irene Lee, a freshman majoring in biological sciences. “I voted for Debbie and Blake because I really liked the feasibility aspect of their campaign as well as their motive to heighten [the] student experience.”
The three senate candidates who garnered the most votes were Diviya Gupta, Jacquelyne Tan, and Michaela Murphy, who received 1,532, 1,407 and 1,400 votes, respectively.
According to USG, the 4,627 votes make up about 24.7 percent of the total undergraduate student population of 18,710 as of Fall 2017. This level of voter participation is typical among other large universities, with UCLA achieving a similar 27.5 percent voter turnout in 2017, according to the Daily Bruin.
Despite turnout being in line with that of other colleges, over 75 percent of the student body did not participate in voting, with some citing a lack of awareness about the election and USG’s importance.
“I wasn’t really paying much attention to the election, which was partly due to me not seeing much of a difference between candidates or thinking the election was very important,” said Bryan Lew, a junior majoring in psychology and accounting. 
To increase the voter participation rate on campus, USG decided to lengthen the campaign period by one week and the voting period by one day.
“One of the main things we did was increase the elections period by one week in order to give candidates more time to do outreach with students and organizations,” USG Senior Director of Communications Daniel Zhu said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We also try to incentivize voting by having food trucks that we partner with and items that we give out during the elections to get people to vote.”
Zhu said that USG will continue to analyze this year’s election process to pinpoint areas for future improvement. Additionally, USG will continue to increase transparency with students to better highlight the critical role student government plays in the undergraduate experience. 
“Every year, our goal is to have a higher voter turnout relative to the prior year,” Zhu said. “We will be debriefing the elections process in the coming weeks to identify factors that contributed to the lower turnout, so that next year’s elections can use our model and build it up even more from there.”

The U.S. State Department of Educational and Cultural Affairs announced Sunday that USC was one of the top producers of Fulbright scholars for the 2017-18 year. 
According to Erica Lovano McCann, the  director of Academic Honors and Fellowships in the Office of Undergraduate Programs, this is the sixth year that USC has received this title. 
With 22 Fulbright students, USC has the most Fulbright participants out of any institution on the West Coast, according to the data released by The Chronicle of Higher Education. 
In comparison, only seven other colleges in the United States have contributed more students than USC has. 
“USC is ranked 8th of all research institutions nationally, and the highest ranked west-coast school,” McCann said in an email sent to the Daily Trojan. “With 22 recipients, this was USC’s largest award year to date … More so, USC has one of the highest yields among other top producing institutions.” 
The high number of Fulbright scholars at USC is a display of student achievement at all educational levels, from undergraduate students to faculty members, according to McCann.
“Trojans are not only talented academically but they are globally aware and invested,” McCann said. “They are seeking to find ways, through research, study, or teaching, to make the world a better place and to promote cultural exchange to a greater degree.”
According to a State Department press release, the Fulbright Program has selected more than 380,000 students for their academic merit and leadership skills. These participants have been given the chance to apply their knowledge by exchanging and creating solutions to international issues. 
“The Fulbright U.S. Student Program encourages bilateral relationships that support mutual understanding and cultural exchange,” McCann said. “USC students have the opportunity to fully immerse themselves in a research, study or teaching setting entirely different from their experience at USC or in the U.S. In turn, they share their own experiences and introduce U.S. culture to those who may be entirely unfamiliar with it.”
In addition to the opportunities that the program provides for students, they also grant awards to U.S. students, teachers and faculty to start individual research and to lecture abroad.

USC has opened its newest international office in London to recruit students in the United Kingdom as well as other European countries, and to serve prospective and current students who are abroad.

The office, which is located in the Bloomsbury neighborhood of London, will serve as a center for recruiting, alumni relations and education and research programs. 
USC President C. L. Max Nikias said in a USC News release that the USC community is excited to continue building on the partnerships and collaborations it has already established in London. 
“Our London office, which will act as our headquarters not only for the U.K. but for all of Europe, will play a vital role in helping us achieve USC’s ambition of attracting the world’s most talented and creative students,” Nikias said in the release. 
The office will be led by Director Priya Rana Kapoor, a third-generation Trojan who will be working with prospective students. In the USC News release, Kapoor said that people usually think USC is a small school in California until she starts telling them about the impact it has had on the surrounding area.
According to the release, USC boasts one of the largest populations of international students, welcoming more than 11,000 foreign students in the Fall 2017 semester. The best way to think of USC’s nine international offices, according to the Associate Vice Provost for Global Engagement Paulo Rodrigues, is as “embassies” located in areas important to the university.
USC already has had an existing presence in London, including the Queen’s College Cambridge–USC exchange, which allows USC undergraduates to spend their final fall semester at the University of Cambridge. The USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism also offers popular programs for students to study in London. Additionally, the University offers the USC Alumni Club of London, a volunteer-run group that connects alumni and supports USC students studying abroad.
Kapoor hopes to use that strong alumni base to build relationships for student interning, mentorship and networking opportunities.

Graduate student filmmakers from the USC School of Cinematic Arts discussed the development of writer and director Kelley Kali Chatman’s SCA thesis film Lalo’s House at a panel held at the Interactive Media Building on Wednesday.
School of Cinematic Arts MFA student Kelley Kali Chatman co-wrote and directed Lalo’s House as her thesis project, with a crew of mostly SCA students and alumni. Maansi Manchanda | Daily Trojan
The event, titled “Our Voices: Kelley Kali Chatman, Garcelle Beauvais, Lisa Wilson and Victor Pourcel,” was sponsored by the USC Media Institute for Social Change and the SCA Council of Diversity and Inclusion.
“[Lalo’s House] is a story about two young Haitian girls that are abducted and placed in an orphanage that is an underground prostitution ring,” Chatman said.
The film was executive produced by actress Garcelle Beauvais and producer Lisa Wilson, and produced by USC MFA film and television graduate student Victor Pourcel. The film was written by Chatman and Yasemin Yilmaz, a graduate of SCA’s MFA in screenwriting program.
“The story is inspired by a series of true events from the work that I was doing in Haiti,” Chatman said.
Chatman first went to Haiti in 2009 to gain an understanding of restaveks, Haitian children who are sent by their parents to serve as domestic workers in households that could support them better. 
“If there was a family that couldn’t take care of their kids, then someone in the community would agree to take the kid in and offer to take [them] to school,” Chatman said. “Over time, bad people took advantage of the situation.”
Pourcel said that he wanted to use the film to educate audiences because of the broader appeal of a fictional work.
“When documentary audiences come to the theater to see a documentary, they already know a little bit about the subject and are already in agreement,” Pourcel said. “But the idea is to reach out to a broader audience.”
Pourcel said that he and Chatman started the project in September 2016 and crowdfunded over $45,000 to make the film.
CORRECTION: An previous version of this post incorrectly stated that Victor Pourcel executive produced Lalo’s House. He actually produced the film. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Former Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student Nikolas Cruz is accused of walking onto the campus in Parkland, Fla. and attacking dozens of helpless students with an AR-15 gun. The shooting left 17 dead and dozens of others injured. 
“Thoughts and prayers” has become an all-too-common phrase tweeted across the internet and spoken by countless politicians who do not take legislative action after shootings. Still, there is gridlock in Congress about what to do regarding recent gun violence to prevent it from continuing. The two political parties blame the other for failing to identify the problem. Democrats suggest stricter gun control laws would prevent attacks, while Republicans argue that “guns don’t kill people; people kill people” just like “pencils don’t cause spelling mistakes” and “cars don’t cause accidents.” 
While it is frightening that despite his suspect record, Cruz was able to get his hands on such a deadly weapon, it is arguably just as alarming how easily he — or anyone for that matter — can enter most school campuses. Yes, there are laws that are meant to prevent trespassing during school hours, but how can they be enforced? 
The idea of adding security guards or arming school teachers has been floating around for quite some time, but neither side is pushing heavily for its implementation. It does no good to blame the other side for failure to act, and then turn away from a realistic bipartisan response. Can you really imagine a politician taking to the podium and advocating against increasing security for helpless children in public schools? That politician would be chastised off Capitol Hill in a mere election cycle. Boosting school security as a possible remedy should certainly be looked into.
Despite how President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for 2019 slashes more than $25 million from funding for school violence prevention programs, members of the Republican Party have suggested it briefly. Each time the suggestion is brought forth, some members of the Democratic Party criticize them for hypocritically being willing to spend more money on security in schools, but refusing to fund other aspects of schools. But why make this political? If politicians suggest security programs that would benefit students and boost safety, this should be taken seriously by all on a bipartisan level.
Grace Cillo | Daily Trojan
The most prominent argument against bettering the security of America’s schools is the hefty cost. One estimate puts adding security guards and several metal detectors in every school in America at a cost of $13.3 billion per year. This estimate includes multiple metal detectors in public and private schools with a $72,000 salary for several security guards at the location. To put $13.3 billion per year in perspective, the Trump Administration’s budget proposal for defense spending is $469 billion, and its proposed infrastructure investment is $200 billion. There is a way to make room for $13.3 billion for children’s safety. Considering conservatives are typically the ones who oppose increased spending on infrastructure, it is surprising that Democrats are not joining them in this push to make schools safer.
The increased security is not guaranteed to prevent all future gun violence on school grounds, but surely it will cause shooters to think twice before they trespass onto schools. Surely security guards, metal detectors and increased surveillance will not cause America’s school children to be less safe. 
That being said, we should not overlook the cost-effective and essentially free solution of gun regulation, which should still be the goal. But this is not altogether very likely in light of the polarizing nature of gun control in Congress. Even if added security prevents just one shooting, it would be more progressive than the current gridlock in Congress, which is doing nothing to save lives. 
We don’t need more “thoughts and prayers” and playing politics. We need action. If gun regulation is off the table in the current political climate due to the economic clout of the National Rifle Association among other causes, then Congress should implement the next-best solution and take action to bring improved security to America’s schools. The two proposed solutions are not mutually exclusive.

Sonali Seth | Daily Trojan
When tragedy struck Parkland, Fla., last week, parents, students and children across the nation were both stunned and exhausted at yet another senseless massacre —  one that common-sense gun regulations could have made far more unlikely.
Some conservative pundits and policymakers who have come under fire for their opposition to gun reform have proposed a different solution: Put police officers in public schools. But if the consequences of increased police presence at low-income schools tell us anything, it’s that implementing law enforcement in a school setting makes students more likely to end up in the criminal justice system and creates an atmosphere of fear at schools. 
Those turning to police as a solution to these shootings are forgetting that in the many schools that already employ School Resource Officers, or on-campus law enforcement officers, this practice has had severe adverse consequences. A 2009 study in The Journal of Criminal Justice found that schools with SROs had a higher arrest rate for disorderly conduct — which could likely be dealt with by teachers — and a lower arrest rate for assault and weapons charges. Another 2013 study in Justice Quarterly found a similar conclusion: When schools increased their police presence, they reported a higher percentage of less serious offenses to law enforcement. The evidence suggests a startling consequence of increasing law enforcement in schools: More children are finding themselves in the justice system for relatively minor offenses, which significantly increases their likelihood of unemployment and dropping out of school. Moreover, the arrests made by SROs disproportionately affect black and brown young people. 
Meanwhile, research also doesn’t establish whether SROs are even effective at reducing gun violence. And Republican lawmakers who claim to support increased school security have no leg to stand on while President Donald Trump released a budget proposal that cut $25 million for school violence prevention programs last week.
“The research that is available draws conflicting conclusions about whether SRO programs are effective at reducing school violence,” Nathan James and Gail McCallion wrote in a 2013 report by the Congressional Research Service. “In addition, the research does not address whether SRO programs deter school shootings, one of the key reasons for renewed congressional interest in these programs.”

Metal detectors at school gates and law enforcement officers searching children for weapons sounds more like a prison than a school. Children should feel safe and comfortable at school, and law enforcement presence can have the opposite effect — especially for students of color who might be more likely to be regarded with hostility by police.
Our instinctual response to a crisis of violence is often to turn to security. Anyone who has flown out of a U.S. airport since Sept. 11, 2001, can tell you that that tragedy dramatically changed the way we fly. Yet, increased security in response to a threat of violence is so often nothing more than a costly, Band-Aid solution to a systemic and evitable problem. Trying to solve today’s wave of mass shootings by putting law enforcement in public schools is yet another one. 
Even after the brutal massacre at Newton, Conn., in 2012, Congress has not passed meaningful reform to reduce gun violence six years later. And so people concerned with the slew of mass shootings, especially at schools, have turned to another solution: increased law enforcement. But this policy is more likely to have severe adverse consequences than reduce mass shootings in the way that safer gun laws would. 
And so, a nation distraught with the uniquely American phenomenon that is the school mass shooting should resist the urge to find a substantial workaround, and instead fight the National Rifle Association, which has used its economic clout to create devastating gun laws. We can pass common sense reform to reduce gun violence if we can agree that background checks would ensure that those with a history of violence should not be able to buy guns; high-capacity magazines are not useful except to fire dozens of bullets in rapid succession, and assault-style weapons have no other purpose than killing people en masse and should simply be banned. 
The New York Times,Washington Post and CNBC have all posted lists of the members of Congress who receive the most funding from the NRA. On Tuesday, Nov. 6, let’s vote them out of office — because we should no longer allow a small, powerful, rich interest group to control weapon policies that affect all of our communities. 
The problem facing us is not that schools are too open. It is that policymakers’ reluctance to regulate the use of guns has enabled the large-scale massacres that have pierced the heart of our nation. Let’s not forget that. And come November, let’s not let them forget that, either.

Freshman infielder Ben Ramirez takes a swing against Utah Valley. Alex Zhang | Daily Trojan
The USC baseball team opened its season Friday at Dedeaux Field against Utah Valley University, the beginning of a three-game home stand. The Trojans entered opening day looking to rebound from a disappointing 2017 season in which the team went 21-34 and finished tied for last in the Pac-12 standings. USC would win the opening series 2-1.
The bats on both sides were sluggish to start the season. Sophomore Chris Clarke and senior Jake Mayer, the starters for USC and Utah Valley respectively, were dealing in the early innings. Through four frames, the teams combined for eight strikeouts and five hits. The Trojans began the first three innings with hits, only to be followed by threestraight-outs each time.
Utah Valley struck first, as first baseman Callahan Moltzan scored from second on a triple by third baseman Paul Estrada in the top of the fifth. Right fielder Jackson Overlund followed with a three-run home run off of Clarke in the sixth, making it 4-0 Wolverines. 
The Trojans mustered 1 run in the bottom of the sixth when junior left fielder Lars Nootbaar scored on an error, but the Trojans couldn’t keep momentum. A passed ball with a runner on third in the top of the seventh made it 5-1 Utah Valley, and the Wolverines held on to win by that score.
“Their kid did a nice job, but we didn’t swing the bats like we’re capable of,” USC head coach Dan Hubbs said. “Whether it was first game jitters, excitement, whatever it was, it wasn’t like us.”
Sophomore center fielder Matthew Acosta was one of several Trojans to go hitless on Friday. 
“It felt like nothing was going our way today, but you know, that’s going to happen in baseball,” Acosta said. “It’s a game of failure, you have to go through adversity.”
For much of the second game on Saturday, it seemed that the result would be the same. The Wolverines took advantage of a shaky outing by junior starting pitcher Quentin Longrie, scoring two of their three second-inning runs on walks with the bases loaded.
But the Trojans weren’t dead. With USC down 4-0 in the fifth inning, Nootbaar homered to right field. Two innings later, after sophomore right fielder Brady Shockey scored on a wild pitch, Acosta put the Trojans up by one with a 3-run bomb to right field.
“I was looking for a fastball up, something I could elevate so a runner could tag up,” Acosta said of the play. “But I just got one I could control and put a good swing on it. [It was] just lucky I got one, lucky to help the team get the W. That’s all that matters.”
The Wolverines got a possible game-tying runner to second with one out in the top of the ninth, but sophomore reliever Connor Lunn struck out the next two hitters to end the game with the save. Freshman reliever John Beller earned his first win as a Trojan.
The Trojans opened the scoring in Sunday’s third game in the bottom of the second inning when junior first baseman Dillon Paulson scored on an error. The Wolverines responded by scoring 3 runs in the top of the third.
After trading runs in the next two half innings, USC surged ahead in the bottom of the fifth. With the bases loaded and no outs, Shockey singled up the middle, driving in Paulson and redshirt junior third baseman Angelo Armenta. A bunt single from redshirt sophomore catcher Kaleb Murphy turned into a score on an errant throw from Utah Valley third baseman Paul Estrada, allowing Ramirez to score from second.
Junior second baseman Brandon Perez came through with his second and third RBIs of the day on a two-out single up the middle, bringing in Shockey and Murphy. Sophomore designated hitter Blake Sabol’s grand rule double to center scored Perez, bringing the Trojans’ runs in the inning to 6, making the score 8-4.
“We were just trying to get a couple on the board just to get us some momentum going into the next innings,” Perez said of the onslaught. “Luckily we put up a big lopsided number and that usually ends up resulting in a win.”
With 12 total hits, USC looked like a completely different team than the one that was blanked by Utah Valley in the season opener. 
“I thought the guys put good at-bats together,” Hubbs said. “We were able to get some free bases and then came up with a couple big hits. I was just excited about the at-bats the guys took throughout the game.”
But nothing came easy for the Trojans this series, and this game was no different. A triple from Overlund and a sacrifice fly from catcher Drew Sims cut the USC lead to 2 runs in the seventh inning. Those would be the final runs of the game, however, as Lunn would close out the ninth for his second-straight save. Junior reliever Solomon Bates picked up the win.
The bullpen was the saving grace for the Trojans; of the 15 runs Utah Valley scored across three games, the bullpen was only responsible for three, and shut the Wolverines down in Saturday’s nail-biter when they were needed the most.
“All in all, I thought our bullpen was fantastic,” Hubbs said. “I was really pleased with what I saw. They came in and attacked the strike-zone for the most part. They all have good stuff and know how to use it, so that was definitely a bright spot.”
On the flip side, Hubbs singled out the starting pitching as an area for improvement. 
“We’ve got to get our starters throwing the way they’re capable of,” he said. “We’ve got to have longer starts so our bullpen isn’t going five innings every game.” 
With a young team, there are going to be ups and downs. Hubbs is more focused on how his players respond to the rough patches.
“The biggest thing was the resiliency of the guys,” he said of the series. “They were able to bounce back after losing the first game. I think that’ll go a long way for the rest of the year for this team.”

Sunday’s game began like most do for the Men of Troy — in a dead heat. At halftime, the Trojans took a 32-30 lead to the locker room. After the break, Oregon State hung tight for as long as they could, trailing by only 4 with six minutes to play. Then, the Trojans broke loose, ultimately winning by 13 points, 72-59.
Senior guard Elijah Stewart scored a season-high 28 points on Sunday. Austin Paik | Daily Trojan
“Our defense was excellent,” head coach Andy Enfield said. USC (19-9, 10-5) held OSU (13-13, 5-9) to 3-15 from 3-point range and 1-6 in the second half. Additionally, the Beavers committed 12 turnovers to nine assists while the Trojans committed nine turnovers to 16 assists. Simply put, USC played superior basketball.
USC’s offense started slowly but accelerated as the game continued. Senior Elijah Stewart scored 17 points in the second half to finish with a season-high 28 for the game. He was 9-10 from the field and 5-5 from beyond the arc. 
“You hit this mood where everything just feels good,” Stewart said about his rhythm. “Your wrist is clicking. Your elbow is locking where it’s supposed to. Your jump is right. Everything feels natural.”
Stewart’s five 3-point field goals advances his career total to 231 — one behind Lodrick Stewart (2004-2007) for the most in USC history.
Aside from his 3-pointers, Stewart ignited the Galen Center with four slam dunks, which he credited to senior guard Jordan McLaughlin. 
“JMac was throwing the lobs in the right place,” Stewart said. “The goal just felt bigger.” 
McLaughlin notched his second consecutive double-double with 13 points and 11 assists. He did not cite urgency after last week’s losses as a reason for his stellar week. Rather, he likes the defense the Oregon schools play.
“The two teams from Oregon play a match-up zone,” McLaughlin said. “I just go with the flow of the game.”
Luckily for McLaughlin and USC, Stewart was converting passes into made baskets. 
Other than Stewart, the Trojans shot 0-9 from 3-point range; sophomore guard Jonah Mathews missed five 3s and finished scoreless. 
All the players feel pressure to play better now that junior forward Bennie Boatwright is out for the season, Stewart said. Boatwright banged his left knee on a play in the second half of Thursday’s game and a recent MRI revealed serious swelling around his patella ligament.
USC tips off its final road trip Wednesday night at Colorado. The Buffaloes have a Pac-12 record of 15-12, 7-8. They are led by a dynamic backcourt duo — freshman McKinley Wright and senior George King — who combine for 27.6 points per game. As a team, the Buffs average 72 points per game. In terms of defense, Enfield would like to keep them around that figure.
“The margin of error is so small this year because the depth of the league is good top to bottom,” Enfield said. 
Naturally, winning on the road is tougher. Although the Trojans are 7-1 at home in conference, they are 3-4 away from the Galen Center. USC needs a good showing in Colorado and, subsequently, Utah, to bolster its NCAA Tournament resume and to keep its shot at a Pac-12 title alive.
To win on the road, McLaughlin said, “We gotta stick together. When it gets loud in other teams’ arenas, we gotta be able to calm the storm.”

Senior guard Sadie Edwards is having a career year, averaging a team third-best 13.8 points per game. Tucker Judkins | Daily Trojan
In a whirlwind weekend of ups and downs, the women’s basketball faced No. 9 Oregon on Friday and No. 15 Oregon State on Sunday. 
While the team ultimately fell to both, it wasn’t as simple as that. On Friday, the team forced the game into double overtime before falling 80-74. Then, the team made the quick turnaround on Sunday’s game, which wasn’t decided until the final minute when Oregon State sealed the 69-63 victory with an inbound pass for a layup. 
If only looking at rankings, the Trojans entered both games as steep underdogs. Yet, USC has been proving that they won’t back down from any fight, leaving head coach Mark Trakh feeling one way.
“[I’m] very proud,” Trakh said. “We played both teams to the wire. The kids just played with a lot of heart against Oregon. We could have won that game and the game [Sunday] was to the wire.” 
One of the biggest factors for the Trojans’ ability to stay competitive is that they lead the Pac-12 in steals with an average of 10 per game. While the team has often struggled behind the 3-point line, its ability to force turnovers and more importantly, convert off them, makes up some of the points it’s missing. The team forced 24 turnovers against Oregon and 17 against Oregon State. 
“I think it’s great,” Trakh said. “It keeps us in. It appeals our offense, we get points off steals and it disrupts the other teams’ offense, so I’m really proud of what they’re doing.”
The team does more than just get steals, though; it has been remarkably durable. Four starters finished off Friday’s game with 48, 49, 49 and 50 minutes with the double overtime. Then, the same starters came back on Sunday to play close to full or full games. 
“We’re tough,” Trakh said. “We get ready for the next game and we played Oregon toe to toe.”
In the end, the Trojans lost both games to top Pac-12 teams, but their performance was more than just the final score. 
“I think that the thing is we haven’t had a bad loss all year,” Trakh said. “No one’s blown us out. We had two 14-point games to UCLA, but one was an 8-point game in the fourth quarter and the other was tied with four minutes to go, so we played with everybody. We’ve never not been in a game.”
Even with the disappointment from last weekend, the Trojans are going into this next weekend positive and ready to top off their regular season with wins.

In many ways, the NBA All-Star Weekend was a smash hit in Los Angeles.
The celebrity game on Friday featured a surprisingly stellar debut from Migos’ Quavo (19 points and the MVP award). Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker shone in the 3-point contest, out-dueling Golden State Warriors sharp-shooter Klay Thompson with a record 28 points. On Saturday, the Slam Dunk Contest provided its typical blend of adrenaline and showmanship, with little actual sport. 
The Dunk Contest was an excellent showcase of the NBA’s youngest and brightest. Utah Jazz rookie Donavon Mitchell narrowly beat out the Cleveland Cavaliers Larry Nance Jr. and fellow first-year player Dennis Smith Jr. to win the crown. Indiana Pacer guard Victor Oladipo was never truly in the contest, but even he provided a gif-worthy moment, when he completed a dunk wearing a mask from the movie Black Panther mask handed out by lead actor Chadwick Boseman at courtside — nothing wrong with a little tasteful cross-promotion. 
But those were the givens. The celebrity game, 3-point contest and dunk contest are always fun spectacles worthy of viewers’ time. It’s the actual All-Star Game that has developed a reputation for being a bit of snooze-fest. In the past, there’s usually been no defense, no seriousness and worst of all, no real incentive to win the damn game. 
The NBA, being the NBA and not the NFL, recognized this problem and made a change. Instead of deploying the usual Eastern Conference vs. Western Conference format, league commissioner Adam Silver decided to have two captains who received the highest number of fan All-Star votes pick teams comprised of All-Stars and play for charities of their choosing. 
This year, the new format pitted the Cavaliers’ LeBron James against the Warriors’ Stephen Curry and it turned out to be the best game of its type in recent memory. Ultimately, Team LeBron emerged victorious in a 148-145 barn-burner that ended in the most unexpected manner imaginable: a defensive stop. It was the lowest total score in an All-Star Game since 2013. In a few moments, it even felt like a real NBA game with actual stakes. 
“Us players, we talked about this, and we changed the landscape of how the All-Star game was drafted and all of that,” James told ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne after the win. “It was up to us to go out and put the finishing product on the game and we were able to do that.”
James, who won his third career All-Star MVP award for his 29-point, 10-rebound performance, is right. He and Curry made a concerted effort to bring back competitiveness to the All-Star Game and it worked tremendously. But what happens beyond this year, if other captains are elected and the league can’t rely on those two mega-stars to keep the game afloat? 
The All-Star Game still requires more tangible stakes in order to stay relevant. The MLB tried to make its version more interesting by giving home-field advantage in the World Series to the winning league, but the practice was discontinued in 2017 because the stakes were actually too high for an exhibition game.
In the future, the NBA needs to find a middle-ground for its All-Star Game. I suggest letting the winning captain return in that role next year, allowing him to pick another squad. This way, there’s some continuity from year to year. It’s fun watching James and Curry chase NBA Finals rings, and it’d also be fun to watch them try to create a dynasty in the All-Star Game. 
This can be made even more interesting by making it so losing captains are disallowed from returning to the role for good, or at least five years. It may seem a bit harsh, but they’d still be able to participate in the game going forward and most players probably don’t care about captaining anyway. By using this format, the All-Star Game could utilize what makes pickup basketball so competitive — winner stays and loser has to wait in line. 
In the NHL All-Star Game, the league used a similar captain vs. captain model as the NBA did this year, but it was short-lived because of a lack of stars outside of the Washington Capitals’ Alexander Ovechkin and Pittsburgh Penguins’ Sidney Crosby. The NBA possesses more stars than its hockey counterpart, but it still requires more stipulations to make its All-Star Weekend a long-lasting, must-watch event. 
By using the winner-stays model, the All-Star Game can invoke all the intensity of pickup basketball and keep the game watchable for years to come.

For someone who had never set foot on a plane until being flown to Los Angeles courtesy of Def Jam Recordings, Jacksonville rapper Trap Beckham has made quick work of hitting the road as part of club appearances, concerts and other cross-country events. Back in the City of Angels for NBA All-Star Weekend, the fashionable rapper certainly looked right at home in the middle of Hollywood, talking about his travels while sitting in the lobby of the Loews hotel.
Rapper Trap Beckham has traveled the country since joining Def Jam, and will release his new Evil Emoji mixtape on March 1. Photo courtesy of Jeremy Karelis.
“A lot of people sleep on Milwaukee, that’s where I got these dope pants from,” he said, referring to his striking white jeans branded with various logos and phrases. “Milwaukee’s got some sauce. They had the most people that looked like they’re supposed to be VIP on the dance floor I’ve ever seen, there was all this Gucci, Louis [Vuitton], Cartier shades everywhere.”
But when it comes to his hometown of Jacksonville, Beckham says the hip-hop scene is relatively limited. By the age of 17 he had made a name for himself in the city after earning radio airplay for his energetic, club-oriented songs, and his stardom only increased when he released the mixtape 7.14.10 on his 19th birthday. Referencing his date of birth, July 14, Beckham maintained the theme after seeing the impact of the initial project, and plans to continue it once again this year with the ninth edition of the tradition, appropriately titled 7.14.18.
“It’s always different, because I’m always at a different point in my life,” he said about the series. “I can just hear the growth. You can tell on 7.14.17 that’s it’s an older person than on 7.14.10.”
Various life experiences have inspired the content of Beckham’s lyrics, and also hav pushed him to explore different sounds to broaden his discography and improve his caliber as an artist. He’s made an effort to experiment with different genres and production styles, trusting his ability to match his skill set to the music in front of him. 
“I’m more melodic now, on a lot of my records,” Beckham said. “I try to explore different things that can make me a better artist and make the songs better. With me, I just adjust to anything. As long as it makes sense, I can make it make sense, too.” 
The rapper will look to tie together all these influences on his upcoming mixtape Evil Emoji, which comes out on March 1. While his latest EP “Life is Lit” was more party-oriented in the wake of receiving his major label deal and seeing a subsequent spike in his life’s trajectory, Beckham says the new mixtape will reflect the wider range of sounds he typically incorporates into his projects.
“It’s going to sound like a little bit of everything,” he said. “It’s an actual project the way I like to drop them, all over the place. ‘Life is Lit’ was more like a themed project, but [Evil Emoji] will have some slow joints, some relatable joints, some party joints.”
Signing to Def Jam in 2016 did much to change Beckham’s career, beyond simply expanding his horizons and audience outside of his hometown. He’s certainly enjoyed the many perks of the celebrity lifestyle, but moreover, he recognized the significance of the achievement to the hip-hop community in Jacksonville, and how it can serve as a catalyst for others looking to follow in his footsteps and take their story beyond north Florida.
“[In Jacksonville] it was scarce for a long time, so when Def Jam gave me a deal, it was a real big deal,” he said. “It’s like, now you can go anywhere and hear something from Jacksonville, that’s major.”
A lack of talent in Jacksonville isn’t the issue in Beckham’s eyes; rather, he argues that artists need to break out of their routines and see the bigger picture for Jacksonville to truly prosper. It took a fateful Def Jam phone call for Beckham to recognize this truth, but once others in the city can see that for themselves, he feels their collective fortunes will begin to trend upward.
“We’re so stuck in our ways down there, that leaving isn’t even the most important thing,” he said. “Making the money and taking care of your family is the most important thing, and you’ll just go to your cool little events, stuff like that. I literally had to be dragged out of that mindstate.” 
True, organic growth takes time. But Beckham sees it as the only way that Jacksonville will eventually make it onto the map in hip-hop.
“It’s not going to happen overnight, but over a long time we’ll become a major city,” he said. “We just have to all contribute and all make the millions, and then put it back into the city.”

Movies from the Marvel Cinematic Universe accumulate much anticipation from nationwide audiences, and Black Panther, MCU’s latest feature, is no exception.
Released on Friday, the movie received the highest number of ticket presales of any MCU film. Director Ryan Coogler, having proven his prowess in creating successful franchise films with Creed three years ago, was tasked with creating a visceral experience in Black Panther. While he certainly displayed his distinct voice with the film’s narrative and themes, the movie also adheres too closely to the standard MCU format, with plenty of CGI-augmented fight sequences and a tidy resolution. 
Chadwick Boseman delivers an exceptional performance  as T’Challa, the protagonist and king of Wakanda. His calm yet stern demeanor is fitting, demonstrating his character’s inner conflicts as a ruler, and is a refreshing deviation from the typical quippy heroes of the past such as Captain America and Spider-Man. Opposite him is Michael B. Jordan as antagonist Erik Killmonger. His radical motivations to reveal Wakanda’s secrets to the world creates a powerful dynamic with T’Challa, as he challenges the king and forces Wakanda to consider providing resources to other nations. While this attribute propels him above most of Marvel’s disposable antagonists, Jordan doesn’t fully sink into his performance and fails to make Killmonger as devious and power-hungry as he could have been.
Their clash for the throne of Wakanda is beautifully presented, as Coogler pays incredible attention to detail when constructing his mise-en-scènes. Wakanda embodies Afrofuturism, seamlessly blending traditional African culture with futuristic technology, from the costumes and the make-up to the aircrafts and weapons.
Instead of trying to place the movie within the larger MCU, it spends its time crafting a self-contained drama that explores various social themes. The movie deals with isolationism to show the council trying to discuss Wakanda’s interactions with the rest of the world. The idea of false idols is also a major aspect to the story, as T’Challa’s perception of his father changes after darker secrets of his past are revealed, subsequently influencing his strategy as a ruler.

Unfortunately, the movie falters when it falls back into the tired tropes of the MCU and dwells within its cookie-cutter framework for superhero movies. When the film does cut to an action scene, it’s mostly uninteresting, as there’s no emotional impact to most punches or hits. 
The scenes are mostly set in green screen environments filled with special effects that range from questionable to mediocre. The climactic battle is an exception, however, as the scene doesn’t clutter the space with so many vehicles or people to the point where the screen becomes a blur of imagery.
This final fight, however, is indicative of another one of the movie’s letdowns. Leading up to the ultimate conflict, many plot points feel rushed and are included only as an obligation to stick to the MCU’s tried-and-tested formula. Moments such as the rapid transition from T’Challa and Killmonger’s final battle to their emotional sunset don’t feel earned because the film doesn’t spend enough time building them up, although the attempt to highlight the undertones in their complicated family structure is valid.
One MCU cliche that Black Panther actually breaks away from maniefests itself within the music. Composer Ludwig Göransson, a long-time collaborator of Coogler, uses drums and vocals to create one of the MCU’s the most diverse and memorable scores. 
With Kendrick Lamar serving as co-executive producer for Black Panther: The Album Music From and Inspired By, the accompanying album also impressed, due to standout features from heavyweights such as SZA and ScHoolboy Q. Spotlighting South African musicians such as Yugen Blakrok and Saudi, the soundtrack also contains a global flavor that meshes well with the movie’s landscape. 
While Black Panther isn’t a perfect movie, the cultural and dramatic elements cement the film as one of MCU’s better installments. Not only does it add much-needed diversity to the Marvel franchise by highlighting a black superhero in an African utopia, but it also tackles important questions such as the proper balance between self-preservation and responsible outreach. 
Wakanda serves an intriguing backdrop for the social commentary that transpires, as a society with the technology to end racial injustice around the globe, but chooses not to out of fear that their discovery will lead to exploitation, pointing to similar historical instances of colonization. From a filmmaking perspective, however, Black Panther has glimpses of greatness, but suggests that the MCU still has a ways to go if it wishes to elevate its storytelling beyond suits and spectacle.
