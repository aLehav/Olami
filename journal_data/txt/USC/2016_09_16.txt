Food delivery services seem to be everywhere in Los Angeles – in fact, it often feels like a new one pops up everyday. Through these services, I have gotten food from popular places like Kazu, Pressed Juicery, and Urth Caffe delivered quickly and easily. Why sit in L.A. traffic and wait at a restaurant when you can get a quality meal delivered straight to your doorstep for just a few bucks extra? The food delivery is convenient and cheap, and many people I know order at least once a week. The question then becomes: Which is the cheapest, fastest, most reliable food delivery service? From personal experiences and conversations with friends, I have compiled a list ranking my top five food delivery services.

After speaking to friends, I concluded that Postmates is the most commonly used and popular delivery service. Every time I order from Postmates, the food comes in under an hour. They have a large range of options from popular eateries, and there is usually a promo code I can find to make delivery cheaper. Postmates drivers are typically attentive and shoot me a text if there is a lot of traffic or if the restaurant is out of the particular food I ordered.

Doordash is a newer and smaller business than Postmates. For that reason, they are constantly offering promotions and discounts. Doordash is a little cheaper than Postmates in general, but the food does take a longer time to arrive. In comparison, I would say that Doordash emphasizes reliability while Postmates focuses on giving customers a lot of options. If I am in no rush, I usually use Doordash.

My favorite thing about UberEats is that it can be linked with an already-existing Uber account. Many of my friends have been using this service recently because they just had a $20.00 off discount in Los Angeles. The delivery took longer than Postmates, but UberEats had a lot of options and the application is very user-friendly. Some people I spoke with had problems contacting their delivery people, so that is why it’s a little lower on the rankings list.

Caviar is a more upscale, premium food service. A benefit of Caviar is that the menu has photos of food accompanying the descriptions. Like many other delivery services, Caviar gives the option to track a driver in real time. Caviar does not overwhelm you with options, it narrows you down to one or two popular restaurants for each type of cuisine. If you want high quality food but are indecisive about where to eat, this is the service for you.

The majority of friends I spoke with did not know much about Grubhub. After doing some research, I got the impression that Grubhub is very focused on providing a lot of food options to customers. However, people do complain about Grubhub’s reliability and customer service. They are known to show up much later than the expected arrival time and often bring a different item than the one you ordered. Although Grubhub does have low prices, ordering through it might not be worth the risk.

After enduring a long nine months without college football, the USC Trojans are back and looking to make an impact this season. We’re a couple of games in already and I can’t wait to see where the coming months will take this team.
First, a reaction to the game against Alabama:
I invite the Trojans to remember that Alabama was the best team in the country last year (and in recent years, for that matter), and while a loss is a loss, there was a lot to the Trojans’ performance that the scoreboard doesn’t show. In the first quarter, we demonstrated a resilience and practicality that kept the Crimson Tide at bay. A staunch defensive effort in the first quarter is a major takeaway for the game, especially against a team like Alabama. Our first-quarter celebrations proved to be somewhat premature, as the Tide ran away with the win. Alabama’s freshman quarterback, Jalen Hurts, had a fantastic debut while Max Browne had some difficulty against Alabama’s defense.
We seemed to lose focus after a couple key plays by Alabama, and from there our mindset and tactics started to change. I’d much rather see the Trojans keep playing the way we were when we were winning: with confidence and control.
The Trojans respond in their home opener:
A week later, as expected, ‘SC came out with intensity against the Aggies of Utah State.  Juju Smith-Schuster (who was visibly frustrated the week before in training) was able to get in the mix, as did team captain, Adoree’ Jackson. That is huge for the Trojans. Smith-Schuster and Jackson energize the team like not many other players can, and we want them to hit their respective strides earlier rather than later in the season. We rotated quarterbacks later in the game, and put some good points up on the board, while the defense was able to stymie almost every drive by Utah State. We wanted a blowout win, and the Trojans provided that with a good all-around performance.
Coming up, the Stanford-USC saga continues:
To be blunt, Stanford has a very good program and many will expect them to win. But don’t count out the Trojans just yet. It’s good for us to play with a chip on our shoulders, with something to prove. In order to have a chance, however, there are a few keys to the game we are going to have to keep in mind. First, the Trojans are going to have to run the ball. With arguably the most talent in the position that we’ve had since the Reggie Bush era, I’d love to see us invest more energy in the ground game than we did in the first two games. Second, if we accept the fact that Christian McCaffrey will dominate the offensive scheme for the Cardinal, then we can respond to that rather than resist it. The goal here for the Trojans should be to bend, but not break when it comes to Stanford’s running game. Third, the Trojans will have to limit Stanford’s special teams to not give up easy yards on straightforward plays. And finally, we can’t let ourselves get rattled on defense and then try to overcompensate on offense. We need to stay true to our strategy and place trust in our star players.
I, for one, am anxious to get this game underway and find out what our Trojans can do against the Cardinal in Palo Alto this weekend. Fight on!

Three pumpkin spice frappuccinos and one Drake concert later, I’ve made it through another week of my senior year. As I make plans to relax and recover this Friday, many other students will be doing the exact opposite at the weekender at Stanford. Even though I have never attended the weekender (not for a lack of trying), after what was a whirlwind first game day weekend, I thought better than to put myself through another one. 
This past game day weekend had more issues than Vogue. For starters, the game was at 11:00 a.m. – which for a few brave souls meant waking up at the crack of dawn and calling a few beers and a bite of a bagel a “healthy breakfast.” I have the receipts (AKA snapchats) that some of my friends were even up at 5:00 a.m. All I can say is “Slay trick, or you get eliminated.” And that is exactly what happened to me – I was no longer in the running towards becoming America’s Next Top Tailgater. Even with complete intentions of going to the game, many of us ended up in our beds or on a friend’s couch by 10:00 a.m. for obvious reasons. Guilty. 
After swiping a few cold slices of pizza at my friend’s place and knocking out until around 5:00 p.m., I considered myself recharged and ready to slay the night. As a preface to the rest of this story that is about to unfold, I have never been to a club. 
I decided to put on my big girl pants and even ventured as far as to wear heels – something my 5’11’’ self doesn’t do too often. As the hour neared to turning in my club “V card,” I touched up my hair and makeup and followed it with two tequila shots. Our pregame was at a friend of a friend’s birthday party. Needless to say, that, combined with the provided Prestige vodka (TBT to freshman year #neveragain), made for an interesting start to the night. When the iPhone clock hit 11:00 p.m., we called Ubers for the group and headed downtown. Standing in a Disneyland-esque line was not on my agenda, so after a few sips of wine out of a Panda Express cup, half of our group decided to migrate to WeHo for the night to a gay club called Mickey’s. After a stop at a 7-Eleven to pee and a few more sips from that “sus” Panda Express cup, we were back en route. 
If only I knew just how much of a calf workout I was about to commit to wearing four-inch heels and still trying to get my life to Rihanna on the dance floor. SOS (Save Our Soles). A $10.00 cover fee later, one Redbull and vodka, and a couple of terribly-mixed electronic songs later, the night was in full swing…and three hours later we were still dancing. It’s almost shameful to admit, but we shut the club down. I felt like I had just trekked through the Sahara Desert; My feet were almost numb by the time my friends and I made our way to the Ubers waiting outside.
Honestly, I would have never guessed my first club experience would be at Mickey’s of all places. Not getting hit on by jeepers creepers all night, but rather playing wingman to my best friends was priceless. The hangover that came the next morning, however, I’d like to get a full refund for. 
So that brings us here: Me, still crippled by my high heel induced injuries and swearing off clubs for a while.

When people ask me why I chose USC, I don’t know what to say.
“What made you come all the way here from Australia?” is what everyone asks and I suppose it’s a completely fair question. However, the truth is I have no idea.
I don’t know why I applied to USC and I’m not sure what brought me here.
Truthfully, my applications for colleges here in America were based solely off movies I’d seen, books I’d read, the usability of a college’s website, and one gigantic book listing the ‘Top 300 Colleges in America.” Thanks for narrowing it down.
The entire application process is now a bit of a blur. I can hardly remember anything about it other than my mother calling out names of schools to me from the kitchen, while I frantically typed into my computer, did a two minute scan, and replied with either “yeah,” “nah,” or “can’t tell.”
Let me paint the picture as succinctly and accurately as I feel I can: I didn’t even apply to UCLA because I thought it was just so far out of my league it wasn’t worth the application just to be declined. USC, on the other hand, was an alright possibility that I didn’t really give any thought to other than; yeah, it could be a good alternative to not getting UCLA… maybe.
When I found out that I’d gotten into USC, I was happier that I wasn’t be rejected from every school in America than I was about USC specifically. In fact, I think I even googled USC after I got in because I realized I didn’t know much about it.
When I came to the Preview Day for admitted students – USC being the last school I had left to visit before making a decision – I fell in love. I fell in love with the campus, the atmosphere, the weather, the culture, the people, and the vibe. After listening to President Nikias make his speech about how great it was that we’d all gotten in, I said to my mum, “This school is academic? Like, really competitive? How did I even get in?”
I still don’t know.
But as you can tell, I didn’t end up at USC via a “normal” route – I didn’t dream of going here, or even choose it as a back-up, I truly just wound up here because of the weather.
Things didn’t magically start making sense once I arrived, either. The entire first week of my freshmen year, I kept wondering where all the girls in my dorm were going off to all dressed up. When I finally asked a girl where she was going, she answered, “Rush!”
I responded, “Rushing? Where to?”

I didn’t know anything about anything or anyone. Greek Life was the number one American-Movie-Legally-Blonde-Thing I’d ever seen. My first tailgate was so crazy and “frat” that I just sent videos of the whole thing to my mum captioned “omg people do this in real life where am I!” I thought it was so weird that people would willingly wear USC apparel to classes, or out in LA, or anywhere that wasn’t the Coliseum and my parents had bets on when I’d wear a USC tee to class for the first time.
Now, as a sophomore, I’m still figuring out how to be a Trojan.
From my Australian culture and expectations, there’s a lot about USC that still stands out as abnormal. Yes, I might fail a class this semester simply because I can’t convert between inches and feet and degrees fahrenheit, and yes – you all have weird accents and say odd things like “ratchet” and “cantaloupe” and “peppers” and “raisins” (a raisin is a sultana people, a sultana!).
But to me, USC is more than that.
USC is diversity. With one of the highest percentages of international students, the culture and food and conversations on this campus are varied and important. People acknowledge gaps between values, and respect difference as a right from one individual to another. International students are not required to conform, but rather, encouraged to express themselves.
USC is challenging. Our school demands a lot from us as students. We are required to invest time and effort and to exert ourselves endlessly in order to fully utilize the facilities on hand. In return, we receive everything: we meet people who challenge our opinions, classes that challenge us academically, extracurriculars that challenge us to break free from our comfort zones. USC is all about new – new people, places, things, ideas and experiences.
USC is opportunity. The alumni network here is one that we all know to be incredible – it’s something we are proud of, and rightly so. The reach of our alumni around the world is something truly remarkable. No matter the continent or country, you are bound to find someone who is inherently proud of the Trojan family, and who will help you, befriend you and welcome you home like an old friend.
I don’t know why I applied to USC, I’m still not sure what brought me here.
All I know is that it was the best non-decision I ever made.

My friend Simo.
For the past three days, I have been indulging in a buzz of barbeque, sweets, and kisses from my host family and relatives. We are celebrating Eid-al-Adha, a Muslim holiday, also known as “Feast of the Sacrifice,” which traditionally lasts three days. Every year, a lamb, sheep, goat or cow is sacrificed as a recreation and commemoration of Ibrahim’s (Abraham) willingness to follow God’s command to sacrifice his son Ishmael. Plot twist- Ishmael is replaced by an animal by God before he is slaughtered; therefore, Ibrahim passed his test.
Disclaimer: this holiday is not for vegetarians, animal activists, or the faint-hearted.  Animal heads are roasted on the streets, an excessive amount of meat is eaten, and a lot of blood is shed.
Wearing a traditional moroccan dress, called a gandora.
As a Muslim, I was elated to celebrate this holiday in a Muslim country to get the “full experience.” It’s not everyday that you seen an animal sacrifice. 
The morning of the first day of Eid, I attended prayers at the mosque of Mohammed V, the previous king of Morocco. The mosque was flooded with thousands of Muslims chanting verses from the Quran. The Imam’s eloquent voice echoed throughout the mosque, as he effortlessly recited the verses in a symphony. Tears formed around my eyes–tears of happiness–as I was mesmerized by the beauty of the recitation but also in awe at the grandiosity and intricate architecture of the mosque. I wish my family could share this ethereal moment with me. 
After prayers, two butchers arrived at my homestay and sacrificed our sheep. The sacrifice is as follows: the animal’s head is pointed toward Mecca, Islam’s holiest city where Prophet Muhammad was born, and God’s name is mentioned before the initial slicing of the throat, in which only the wind pipe, jugular veins and carotid arteries are cut, leaving the spinal cord intact. This way, most of the animal’s blood is drained through the neck, resulting in more hygienic meat. I’m not going to lie, witnessing it was personally quite disturbing. The only other time I have seen this was at a farm when I was 10 years old. Slaughtering animals in your home is illegal in the U.S.
My host mom and I preparing for the barbecue.
We then prepared kabobs with the sheep’s liver, heart and kidneys, wrapped in tripe. I am assuming we eat the organs first because they spoil the fastest.
In the evening, my host sister and her in-laws visited us during tea time. Tea time consists of mint tea, coffee, and many sweets. I sit there and smile, translating snippets of their Darija (colloquial Moroccan tongue) conversation in my head. I am still a beginner at Darija and really need to improve. They mostly talk about the sheep and ask where I am from.
Moroccan sweets flavored with almond, rose water, chocolate, cinnamon, and more.
For dinner, we had organ tagine, a stew dish. Tagine is my favorite Moroccan dish so far. I’ve had vegetarian tagine, lamb tagine, fish tagine, and now, organ tagine. The meat is always so tender and melts right in your mouth. 
The second day of Eid, the weather had cooled down and it rained and I somehow caught a fever. I stayed in bed most of the day, getting up for meals and homework. We had another barbeque, but this time with leg meat. 
I love kabobs.
In the evening, a few relatives and friends came over for tea time and dinner. My favorite part of the night was dessert, which was a strawberry, pistachio and coffee ice cream cake from a popular ice cream shop, Oliveri. 
The third day of Eid, I woke up with an upset stomach, assuming it was just my body getting used to the food. However, my host dad and sister experienced the same sickness and we all laughed about it as we ate potatoes and rice for the rest of the day.
I had a total of five days off for Eid, if you include the weekend. Many of my classmates left Morocco to travel and take advantage of the vacation. I am glad I stayed in Morocco because not only did I bond with my host family, but I ate a lot of delicious food and celebrated a holiday dear to my religion.  
My host sister and I.
