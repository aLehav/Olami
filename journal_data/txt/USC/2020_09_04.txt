The Milwaukee Bucks finished the shortened 2019-20 regular season winning more than 75% of their games. In a top-heavy Eastern Conference, they finished out on top by 2.5 games. They lost only five games at home, and they did it all with the reigning MVP, current Defensive Player of the Year and four-time All-Star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo.
Here’s the problem, though: The Bucks — and Giannis — don’t pass the eye test. At all. To put it bluntly, they are boring to watch.
Milwaukee is already down 2-0 to the Miami Heat — a fifth seed in the east — in the Conference Semifinals. And to be honest, I’m not sure if I would be too surprised if they go down 3-0 Friday.
This isn’t to say that the Bucks are not a good team, because of course they’re good. For the regular season, the Bucks finished first in points and rebounds per game, third in field goal percentage and sixth in assists per game. Good offensive teams perform well in those categories.
But haven’t you noticed that they don’t lead any particular offensive category?
The Los Angeles Clippers, Utah Jazz, Denver Nuggets, Oklahoma City Thunder, Toronto Raptors, Houston Rockets and Boston Celtics lead the NBA in points, field goal percentage, three point percentage, free throw percentage, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks per game respectively.
Although OKC and Utah are already eliminated from the playoffs, Milwaukee isn’t at the top of any single offensive statistic. The Bucks’ power lies in their defense.
Yes, Milwaukee is a defensive juggernaut: They lead the NBA in defensive rating, defensive rebounds and opponent points in the paint. Likewise, Giannis led the league in defensive rebounds and defensive win shares, which helped the Bucks win games.
However, this shouldn’t automatically warrant winning Defensive Player of the Year. Giannis finished No. 40 in the league in blocks per game and No. 98 in steals per game. His 6-foot-11 stature, 7-foot-3 wingspan and unreal athleticism clearly help him out, but why wasn’t Los Angeles Lakers forward Anthony Davis considered more, since he finished No. 16 in steals per game and third in blocks per game and helped the Lakers to the top seed in their conference? For the record, he was still in the top-22 in defensive rebounds and defensive win shares.
I just spit out a bunch of stats and names, but here’s what I’m really trying to get at: As spectacular of a defensive team the Bucks are, their offense isn’t good enough to outplay other defenses in the playoffs, including Miami’s. It’s not electrifying, and Giannis and shooting guard Khris Middleton take virtually every single shot as they are the only two Bucks to score more than 20 points per game this season.
Miami’s young guards and wings, which include Jimmy Butler, Goran Dragic and Tyler Herro, are outrunning and outshooting Milwaukee’s guards. They’re doing it by continuously finding and taking open shots, whereas the Bucks seem to try to force everything through Giannis.
An easy start to fixing this problem is to get more points off turnovers; Milwaukee finished just 10th in that category this season despite its stellar defense. This standing is also behind the other three remaining Eastern Conference teams (Toronto, Boston and Miami), so forget about winning the Finals for a second. If they want to even get there in the first place to compete against a team like the Clippers or Lakers, they need to capitalize on forcing an eighth-best average of 14 turnovers per game.
Here’s what might be another problem, as proposed by former NBA forward Richard Jefferson: What if Giannis is more of a Scottie Pippen than a Michael Jordan? Does he need that extra superior star power to take him over Milwaukee’s playoff bumps?
The answer to this question is thought provoking because although Jefferson could very well be right, the debate gets more complicated when you start to mull over options for Giannis. The Greek Freak is expected to test free agency after the playoffs, and Vincent Goodwill of Yahoo Sports reported Thursday that it’s an “open secret” that Miami and Toronto are the leading candidates to land Giannis.
You know what they say: If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em. Isn’t that right, Kevin Durant?
Anyway, Milwaukee needs to perform better this series (and the next if they make it, somehow), and by better, I mean they need to be more exciting to watch. If they’re not going to play well through better ball movement and more points in transition, they’ll be in trouble sooner than they’d like.

When Marlee Roberts, a graduate student studying entrepreneurship and innovation, first began working in the film industry, she was a child actor alongside her sister, Karlee Roberts. The more auditions they attended, the more they realized that the roles they auditioned for seemed one-dimensional. 
As much as Marlee loved being in front of the camera, she preferred to be behind the scenes, creating stories that featured strong, multi-faceted women alongside her sister.
“I don’t know if there was ever a time where I wasn’t interested in telling stories through the medium of the film,” Marlee said. “There’s no one moment that it just happened. There was no film that I watched that said I had to do this. It was kind of innately born from the need to share stories in a way that could reach a large audience.”
In July, the script for her and Karlee’s teleplay “Unnatural Selection” was selected as a finalist for the Humanitas Carol Mendelsohn College Drama Fellowship, and the winners will receive a $20,000 cash prize. Humanitas, a nonprofit organization, is dedicated to honoring the work and time of both film and television writers whose work explores the greater nuances of the human condition.
“Unnatural Selection” is a story told through the perspective of Cassandra, a single mother who is also the CEO of a leading fertility clinic that enables vitro gene editing for patients battling preventable diseases. The story also explores the complicated nuances of motherhood and the consequences of working in a field with ethical dilemmas. Karlee first learned about gene editing during her time as a graduate student at Columbia University and talked with her sister about whether the topic could be used ethically, which led them to their idea for the play.
“I was sitting in a sociology class when I first learned about genetic gene editing and genetic modification of humans,” Karlee said. “Right after I ran up to Marlee and I was like, ‘Marlee, we can control our own evolution?’ There were so many moral questions that we had following afterwards. We were taking a look at this technology, and we were realizing that it compounds so many pre-existing issues today in our society.”
To accurately present the science behind the script, the two sisters began by researching CRISPR-Cas9, the technology utilized by medical researchers and geneticists to remove, add or alter parts of the DNA sequence. Along with researching CRISPR-Cas9, the two sisters took a hands-on approach in enlisting the help of professionals, while keeping the overarching goal of successful storytelling in mind.
“With the aim of staying true to those scientific elements, Karlee enlisted the help of professors in the biological sciences,” Marlee said. “And I shadowed the day to day of fertility clinic specialists. The goal is to carefully try to convey that work through the accessibility of storytelling.”
As Marlee began writing the script, she noticed elements of her graduate studies influencing the choices that she made during the creative process, which in turn bled into the creative process that she shares with her sister.
“I took a design thinking class, and I never kind of expected it to really challenge the way that I thought about writing, but it did,” Marlee said. “When you’re thinking about design thinking you’re dissecting problems and needs, and since we have a show with all these kinds of moral dilemmas, it’s helpful to have that kind of framework to decide which perspective we want it to take with the characters.”
In the design thinking class that Marlee took, “The Entrepreneurial Advisor: Problem Solving for Early-Stage Companies,” taught by Marshall School of Business lecturer Jeremy Dann, she worked on “Creative Immersion,” a project for students to document the growth of their mindsets through a creative journey. Dann said he remembers that Marlee came from an innovative background due to her experiences in filmmaking, which reflected in her “Creative Immersion” project about remodeling her bathroom.
“A key thing is you don’t just do the project,” Dann said. “You document it every day, where you succeeded, where you failed. You document all the times your brain hurt. She did a really strong job doing that. Even for someone who considers themselves creative, you can still find a whole new kind of muscles in your brain to be working out.
Dann also said Marlee’s willingness to share her creative process was something that other students were able to learn from as well.
“In a class like this one, the professor knows quite a bit about the subject and knows the ways that they might try to force people to stretch their capabilities,” Dann said. “But also you need your allies amongst the students who know a lot about some of these areas. She was definitely someone that would make comments that other students could learn a lot from about creative thinking and having that mentality that you bring from experience to experience.”
Although the process of writing the teleplay together as sisters was not an easy one, especially since Marlee lives in Los Angeles and Karlee resides in New York City, it was one that both sisters said they felt was worth it in the end because they were able to shed light on a topic that is important to them.
“Marlee and I were together when we found out that we were finalists, and she just gave me the biggest high five,” Karlee said. “We were so happy. We did a high five and a hug but it felt so validating that these types of stories can be told on screen and that you can have a powerful woman in STEM and have her as a leading protagonist and focus on a script that’s so grounded in motherhood.”
Currently, the sisters have plans to bring their teleplay to life on the big screen. They want to continue creating projects that show women in more realistic roles.
“We’re using this momentum from the fellowship to help push it forward and try to get it into production,” Marlee said. “We have a slate of other projects as well that we’re working on all that kind of unravel notions of femininity and various cultural constructs.”

Content warning: This article contains explicit references to instances of sexual abuse, sexual harrassment, victim-blaming and harrassment based on gender and race.
Twenty five former USC students have come forward with a new lawsuit against former campus gynecologist George Tyndall, the University and 500 unnamed defendants with working relationships to the University, a press release from law firms Arias Sanguinetti Wang & Torrijos and Janet, Janet and Suggs confirmed Thursday. 
This brings the total to over 800 current and former students who have opted out of the $215 million class action settlement in January and who have filed lawsuits against USC and Tyndall, saying the University played a role in covering up about three decades of sexual abuse against patients at the Engemann Student Health Center. 
Additionally, Doe defendants 1 through 500, are alleged to have “engaged in a pattern and practice of ignoring complaints, failing to investigate sexual harassment and abuse complaints, deliberately concealing information from abuse victims as well as law enforcement and the Medical Board of California, and contributed to a sexually hostile environment on campus at USC,” according to the lawsuit. The identity and working capacities of these defendants are not yet known, but are said to comprise employees, agents or servants of USC who were under the University’s direct supervision.
“Throughout the litigation process involving George Tyndall, USC has been committed to resolving these lawsuits fairly,” the University wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan Thursday. “Once the university is served with this lawsuit, it will review and respond to the allegations through the legal process.”
The plaintiffs, identified as Jane Does 138 to 162, have filed complaints that span almost the entirety of Tyndall’s tenure at USC, ranging from undergraduate and graduate students who attended the University from the late 1980s to 2017, a year after Tyndall was placed on leave pending an investigation into his conduct.
The lawsuit calls the defendant Tyndall “a serial sexual predator” who took advantage of his position to commit sexual abuses such as forcing patients to undress in his presence, photographing patients while they were unclothed, penetrating patients with unwashed hands and without personal protective equipment and making repeated comments that were meant to sexually harass and were racist and misogynistic in nature. 
In addition, the lawsuit turns to USC for letting Tyndall’s actions, “committed to satisfy [his] own prurient sexual desires,” continue for years while harboring knowledge of his actions by complaints from his patients. 
“Despite the fact that USC has publicly admitted that it received numerous documented complaints of TYNDALL’s sexually abusive behavior dating back to at least the year 2000, and that such complaints are now known to have existed as early as the year 1988, USC actively and deliberately concealed TYNDALL’s sexual abuse of female student patients for years, continuing to grant TYNDALL unfettered sexual access to the young students in his and USC’s, care, all to protect Defendant USC’s reputation and financial coffers,” the lawsuit read. 
The Los Angeles Police Department launched a criminal investigation into Tyndall’s conduct in May 2018, leading to the L.A. County District Attorney’s office filing 29 felony counts against him, including 11 counts of sexual battery by fraud of 16 different women from 2009 to 2016.
While the LAPD’s investigation is still pending, the civil suit allows the plaintiffs to bring action against Tyndall’s misconduct and under the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act under California civil code, which prohibits discrimination, intimidation or coercion based on a protected class that threatens the individual’s enjoyment of their personal and constitutional rights.
In total, the suit includes 16 causes of action against Tyndall, USC and Does 1 through 500 — along with the request for a jury trial. 
“USC paid more attention to its own financial gain and chose to protect a sexually deviant doctor instead of thousands upon thousands of women who trusted USC over the course of decades,” the press release read. “USC’s conduct empowered Tyndall to be an abusive predator for decades.”

Although it seemed unlikely when the coronavirus pandemic first began, the tennis U.S. Open is underway in New York this week, opening Monday and running through Sept. 13. In both the men and women’s brackets, former USC players are hitting the courts to play against some of the strongest competition in the world. 
In the men’s bracket, No. 1 doubles player Robert Farah and No. 64 singles player Steve Johnson began play this week. In their collegiate years, both Farah and Johnson were part of the nationally acclaimed Trojan men’s tennis teams that won NCAA team national titles in 2009 and 2010 and were ranked No. 2 in doubles for that season. Johnson went on to aid the Trojans to team titles in 2011 and 2012. 
On Monday, 2016 Olympic bronze medalist Johnson won an electrifying upset against well-respected American player No. 16 John Isner at Louis Armstrong Stadium. It took five sets — 6-7, 6-3, 6-7, 6-3, 7-6 — with Johnson winning the final tiebreaker 7-3. 
“You can’t get frustrated when John’s hitting aces,” Johnson said to the Association of Tennis Professionals Tour about Isner’s iconic serve and his 52 aces during the match. “I guessed right a lot and they still got by me. It’s just the way it is.”
However, Johnson went on to lose to Lithuanian Ričardas Berankis in four sets in the second round Wednesday, 5-7, 2-6, 6-1, 6-7, ending Johnson’s run at this year’s tournament.
Former U.S. Open and Wimbledon winner Farah will look to defend his doubles title this year with fellow Colombian Juan Sebastián Cabal as the No. 1 doubles team in the world Saturday against No. 21 Jean-Julien Rojer and No. 20 Horia Tecau. 
Farah and Cabal played Thursday against French Édouard Roger-Vasselin and Austrian Jürgen Melzer, easily winning in two sets — 6-2, 6-3 — showing off their dominance on the courts. 
In the women’s bracket, there are three former USC players playing in New York. There is the all-Trojan doubles team of No. 65 ranked Giuliana Olmos from Mexico and No. 63 ranked American Kaitlyn Christian as well as the doubles duo of former Trojan No. 66 ranked American Sabrina Santamaria and Australian Arina Rodionova. 
During their collegiate career at USC, Olmos consistently ranked among the top players in the nation while attaining impressive honors such as ITA All-American and All-Pac-12 First Team in the 2014-15 season. Both Santamaria and Christian also earned superb honors during their time with the Trojan tennis team. In the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons, they were one of the top doubles teams in the nation, reaching No. 1 at one point and winning the NCAA doubles national titles in both seasons.
Olmos and Christian competed against the No. 1 doubles team of Hungarian Timea Babos and French Kristina Mladenovic of France for their first match Thursday. Despite a strong effort, they lost 2-6, 2-6.
In their first match Wednesday, Santamaria and Rodionova faced the No. 2 doubles team of Belgian Elise Mertens and Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka but lost in straight sets 2-6, 0-6. 
Although many Trojans’ time in New York has come to an end, the former USC stars proved capable of handling some of the top professional heat in the game — and some are still looking to prove even more as play continues.

When I was attempting to come up with a name for this column, “The Beat Goes On” by Sonny and Cher was ringing in my mind. I’ve always been fascinated by a variety of genres and eras of music. I was the kid who grew up listening to ’60s, ’70s and ’80s hits in middle school. Honestly, nothing’s changed there. I still love the songs and artists I loved then such as David Bowie, Cher, Prince, the Beatles and Elton John — they all still pop into my eclectic range of playlists. Only now, I’m very much in tune and interested in what popular artists are producing right now in the current music scene. 
Admittedly, I’ve watched many documentaries on musicians, revealing my major music nerd tendencies. This got me thinking about how music can act as the voice and soul of a generation. Each decade brings about new challenges, new inventions, pop culture phenomenons and movements. I mean, 2020 started with a pandemic. Can we just take a moment? Welcome to the ’20s. We’ll get through it, and the music will offer an antidote for us all. 
Exploring a wide-ranging selection of music from the past and present, hence why “The Beat Lives On,” this column will discuss how music transcends and reflects what’s going on not only in our innermost but outermost circles.
And for those who may not know, the two mentioned above (Sonny and Cher) were a rock husband-and-wife duo famous in the mid-’60s, selling more than 40 million records worldwide. The entertainers were known for songs “I Got You Babe” and “Baby Don’t Go” as well as their media presence with their hit television show, “The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour.” I absolutely love them. 
With that, let us turn our attention to the ’60s. Many artists who have come before and after the decade have vocalized important matters concerning contemporary times through their songs and activism. Aretha Franklin, Jimi Hendrix, James Brown, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones were among some of the most influential artists of the ’60s, capturing the decade’s atmosphere. Songs such as Sam Cooke’s “A Change is Gonna Come,” Aretha Franklin’s “Respect” and James Brown’s “Say It Loud — I’m Black And I’m Proud,” demanded equality, respect and justice — the eternal soundtrack of the ’60s. 
Though the ’60s are years past, they were a time of social and cultural revolution, when music reflected the decade’s attitude toward major political movements, such as civil rights and the anti-Vietnam War. Popular music at the time was also heavily influenced by counterculture, environmentalism and feminism. And even now, popular music continues to bring up serious subjects, ones that matter and that many of us are experiencing and concerned about during this pandemic. 
What I’m saying is that music has been a long-standing tool for artists seeking to speak up about social change and a means for self-expression when hardships make it difficult. There’s something so overwhelming and powerful about music that other mediums can’t quite achieve. It can bring up fond memories of the past, inspire us to change, be more understanding of one another, connect and give us a way to express ourselves when we can’t muster up the words.  
Ever meet someone who loves the same artist as you? Who attended the same concert or event as you and immediately became your best friend? There’s something about music that bonds people — almost like you’ve lived through the same things and understand each other because of it. 
As protests continue across the country and the pandemic rages on, music and activism continue to support each other, inspiring artists and fans alike to take action. These movements are huge, and ones we’re all being made more aware of. As a result, the transformation and evolution of music and performance are unfolding right before our eyes. But the intersection of music and activism isn’t just a recent endeavor. 
Black Lives Matter has been a movement of multiple generations more than it has been a momentary feat. Artists now are again pushing forth important messages on social injustice in their music. 
Music then and is now, in 2020, the voice and soul of a generation, keeping people together when we’re all apart. Among those voices are popular artists such as Beyonce, Kendrick Lamar and Childish Gambino. Queen Bey brought us “Freedom” featuring rapper Kendrick Lamar in 2016 that delivers empowering lyrics on breaking free from what holds us down. Childish Gambino brought us “This is America” in 2018 as a commentary and reflection on what needs change in our nation. The music video references race and gun violence in the United States, responding to the way that Black lives have been historically targeted. 
More recently, following the speeches and performances at the MTV Video Music Awards last Sunday, it’s clear that artists are unafraid of making their voices heard in times of social change.
DaBaby’s performance of “Blind” at the VMAs highlighted the Black Lives Matter movement and paid tribute to the ongoing protests in response to the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade and many other Black lives lost this year and many years before. While performing on stage, a police car pulled up and DaBaby was shown getting arrested, handcuffed and put in the back seat. 
The Video for Good award went to H.E.R. for the song “I Can’t Breathe.” The lyrics are incredibly strong and H.E.R.’s voice rings clear: “Started a war screaming ‘Peace’ at the same time, all the corruption, injustice, the same crimes, always a problem if we do or don’t fight.” The singer used the video to expose racial injustice in the United States and to support the movement. 
Especially in times of hardship, I feel that music heals and can have an impact on social change. In a time where there’s a growing sense of alienation and isolation, music pushes us to interact with each other, with the world and with the challenges that we all face. It shows us how we can move together, link arms (metaphorically at the moment) and call for change. In times of uncertainty and fear, music reveals the voice and soul of a generation. 
Emily Sagen is a senior writing about music’s lasting impact. She is also an arts and entertainment editor at the Daily Trojan. Her column, “The Beat Lives On,” runs every other Friday.

Representation and the expansion of Black history matter profoundly, especially amid the current social climate. In 2020, the injustices carried out against and the killings of Black people have proliferated in the mainstream media. The overwhelming nature of so much coverage of an unjust system that has systematically oppressed Black people can be numbing. Despite these dark moments, though, Black people had something to cheer about: There was a moment of victory amid protests and strikes while Black people watched from their homes, cars and jobs as Sen. Kamala Harris delivered her vice-presidential nomination acceptance speech. 
“And let’s be clear — there is no vaccine for racism. We’ve gotta do the work,” Harris said. “For George Floyd. For Breonna Taylor. For the lives of too many others to name. For our children. For all of us. We’ve gotta do the work to fulfill that promise of equal justice under law, because none of us are free until all of us are free.”
Sen. Harris gave an eloquent speech, offering a brief autobiography and describing how, as a young girl, she always hoped this moment would come. Yet, she expressed, she understood the obstacles ahead that would seek to systematically prevent her from ever standing at that podium. She now writes herself in the Black history books by becoming the first Black female vice-presidential candidate on a major party ticket.
In saying that, one cannot ignore or dismiss some of her questionable practices in the early stages of her career, such as her 27 years as a prosecutor, during which she enforced laws that sent countless members of the Black community to prison and neglected to prosecute killer cops. This will be one of the primary reasons she may not gain additional votes for the presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden. 
That being said, it is still a matter of celebration that her representation gives other young Black children the ability to dream big. Her placement on the Democratic ticket breathes further excellence for Black people, as she is an alumna of a historically Black university, Howard University in Washington, D.C. 
Throughout the years, people have been extremely critical of HBCU education; some have even gone so far as to accuse them of not providing a credible or reliable education. All it takes is a quick look to the history of HBCUs to see that these claims are baseless and that there have been many notable professionals that have come from a historically Black college education, including  Chadwick Boseman, Oprah Winfrey, Common and Spike Lee, to name just a few. 
Sen. Harris not only promotes the higher learning of an HBCU, but also the continued efforts of Black fraternities and sororities that have historically been at the  front and center of activism, as she is a member of the first Black sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc.  Her membership makes Sen. Harris a part of the Divine Nine, a predominantly Black Greek letter organization that is encompassed into the National Pan-Hellenic Council. These Black Greek letter organizations birthed greatness in multiple professions, ranging from musicians, athletes, activists and business moguls. Some examples of former members are Martin Luther King Jr., Colin Kaepernick, Steve Harvey, Jerry Rice, Kendrick Dean, Maya Angelou, Aretha Franklin, Dionne Warwick and MC Lyte.
Founders and members of the Divine Nine have been at the forefront of history through their acts of voter registration, their increase of social and economic awareness for the community and their contribution to higher employment rates in areas that are economically disadvantaged. These organizations’ focus on community service and the advancement of Black women is paralleled in the practices that Sen. Harris preaches. The Divine Nine has historically looked to drive the development of women and men into purposeful lives and futures while fuelling the expansion of the social and economic status of Black Americans. 
Sen. Harris has not been shy to let it be known that her education was from one of the most prominent HBCUs in the country, likely with the goal of encouraging other members of the HBCU community to support the Democratic ticket. That being said, she will not necessarily garner the same support from other student bodies, such as USC’s. Her unapologetic Blackness may offset some voters. For others, her questionable criminal justice policies are non-negligible red flags. On the far end of the spectrum, some may not be able to relate to Sen. Harris and what she represents as a Black woman.
However, that may be just the thing that this country needs — an uncomfortable face that challenges deeply-rooted, discriminatory ideologies of Black people. The achievements of a Black woman such as Sen. Harris will bring into question, as it already has, the racist thinking of those who feel people of color are inadequate to be anything more than the oppressed. 
Black history lives on because of the many ancestors who refused to let their oppressors remain in the driver’s seat of their humanity. They understood that they were more than enslaved people. They were human beings that should be given the opportunity to be treated fairly and equally. Despite the evident strides that have been made in this country, there is still much work to be done. The same mindsets and teachings that kept Black people in bondage still permeate the nation and constantly remind the Black community that this country was never meant to protect or uplift their lives. In the face of this oppression, the history of exceptional Black people is powerful and growing. 
All things considered, what matters most is the fact that young Black girls across the country watched Sen. Harris speak: Though they may not have understood then the importance of that moment, they saw someone that looked like them gearing up to lead the nation and such powerful representation will likely mark their lives forever. Black history continues to live on, with Sen. Harris adding another chapter to the book.

Lectures on Zoom will (unsurprisingly) never be like those in real classrooms. Simply knowing that one is a click away from making an online lecture vanish from sight can make the lectures feel like impenetrable YouTube videos where creators and viewers remain separated. In fact, frequent technical difficulties never fail to remind us of that distance.
Fortunately, though, online classes do not have to feel this way. By devoting live class time to office hours and collaborative assignments, while allowing students to “watch” lectures on their own time, professors can reduce this distance. One of the main arguments for this is that asynchronous lectures are not necessarily inferior to synchronous ones — in fact, they offer unique advantages.
Of course, when not watching a lecture in real time, it is impossible to ask questions or answer those of professors, who like to keep students engaged by encouraging them to brainstorm techniques to spark rich conversations with diverse viewpoints. Undeniably, this interaction is key to students’ ability to retain the course material. However, it is also true that asynchronous lectures allow students to pause the lecture to take detailed notes, absorb the material and rewind parts that weren’t clear. 
Besides, asynchronous lectures let students fast-forward sections they are comfortable with or when professors speak rather slowly. This not only saves time but can also help increase focus as pauses and lengthy bits are eliminated. Additionally, they can be watched in small increments at a time, which means that students won’t miss them because of a doctor’s appointment or other commitments.
As for questions concerning the lecture, it is sometimes better to let information sink in and search for answers on one’s own time (usually through a quick re-read or internet search), and write down questions to ask the professor next class if further help is needed. After all, many crucial questions can arise after applying the course material in assignments, which is a good way to test one’s knowledge. 
Yes, synchronous lectures can also be recorded and posted on Blackboard. In fact, it’s already being done for international students in different time zones, demonstrating that asynchronous lectures can do the job, too, while leaving time for more interactive activities. By recording lectures, live class time could then be allocated to the completion of assignments and office hours, both of which increase engagement and social contact.
It could go something like this: Most homework assignments take place during half of a class’ total weekly time, leaving the remaining half to office hours that could take place either right after in-class assignments or during the next class of a given week. In this format, students would be able to work on assignments individually or together in breakout rooms and subsequently share their answers and discuss with other students and groups. 
For students, such active learning environments are beneficial because they encourage critical thinking and offer exposure to a variety of perspectives. They also help students comprehend, retain and apply new teachings in practical situations. Indeed, reviewing the work of fellow classmates is a chance to compare problem-solving methods, learn new knowledge and reflect on mistakes. 
Socially, ensuring that students can interact with anyone in their class is a great way to compensate for the absence of a physical campus, not to mention that it can be useful during group projects when group members face difficulties with scheduling and chasing disengaged classmates. Also, for students who tend to procrastinate (especially when they are at home), having to log into Zoom to complete assignments is a great incentive to start early and represents an opportunity to be more time-efficient. 
This format has benefits for professors, too. A common issue with online learning is that it is impossible to prove whether or not a student is really doing their own work. Depending on professors’ objectives, in-class assignments could be graded or simply used as practice exercises. For example, a graded assignment might take up the whole class time on a given day and leave the remaining class time for the week to office hours. In the case of a practice exercise, however, the professor could use the rest of the lecture to go over students’ answers and take questions.
While office hours could remain optional, it is safe to say that students are more likely to attend with this method than when office hours are random or appointment-based. With more students showing up, one can imagine that professors might have fewer emails to respond to as a whole. This system could also be easily adaptable to international students, who could be grouped together by time zone to complete assignments together on Zoom.
Incorporating more interaction and engagement into the online class model is no novel idea. In fact, General Education requirements and some other classes already incorporate discussion sections, acknowledging the need for more interaction and group exercises. With online classes, communication is made more difficult and social contact is reduced, so teaching formats should reflect this change. Otherwise, the quality of learning will be reduced.

In an immigrant family, one of the first things you come to realize is that your dreams are not just your own. Aspirations and ambitions become almost communal in these family dynamics; there is something to be sowed and reaped by everyone within the family tree. 
Within these life plans, there is a cyclical collaboration that exists. In mine, in particular, I’ve noticed that the commitment to my education and career reaches far back into my family line. For those individuals that oversee my journey, even the smallest of my successes finds a place within their own personal triumphs.
In a sense, my education from USC belongs to me, but it also belongs to my father, who fostered my love for Trojan football; to my grandmother, who cosigned my student loan; and to my mother, who gave up a career in the Philippines so that I might have one here. 
It creates a chain of well-wishes and oftentimes unsolicited guidance, but there is the general consensus that higher education comes to mean the difference between static existence and forward progression. 
I was a little girl when I came to America. I was 3 years old, with a Filipino American father and a Filipina mother. My dad knew everything about life in America, and my mom knew nothing of it. Despite their differing worldviews, there was something I was taught from a young age that seems to hold true across many cultures: Acquiring an education is synonymous with the idea of a better life. 
With no true basis of comparison, it was a true conundrum that I only began piecing apart as I grew older. I never lacked any basic necessities and I never felt as if I had anything less than those around me, but I was only able to register the foundation behind this mindset when I grew to understand who my parents were. 
Here and there, I’d glean bits of their past lives, and I was awed to realize that there existed a substantial thread between two narratives. Though my father grew up in the heart of Los Angeles as a latchkey kid and my mother grew up well-off in a developing nation, their differing backgrounds found union in an idea impressed upon them by their parents: the hope of something more.
In conversations with friends who come from immigrant families or who are immigrants themselves, I’ve found this to be an identifiable commonality in the way hyphenated Americans are raised. The trope that immigrant families push education on their children is no false narrative. Education is upheld as the great equalizer of opportunity, the path to this metaphysical “something more.”
The great problem that I have found is that this tool that provides the equality of opportunity is not so readily financeable for everyone. For me and many other immigrants living in America, our journeys are typically not so straightforward. 
For low-income children, immigrant children and those who are undecided about what their career path may be, one of my hopes for American society going forward is the normalization of community college as a first choice. There is a stigma attached to these educational institutions that hinders prospective students and overshadows the achievements of those that attend these colleges. 
In my experience, community colleges are wellsprings of opportunity that should be considered when financial barriers arise. They are altogether inclusive and diverse in their range of studies. They provide incomparable programs for financial support and educational assistance for first-generation immigrants like myself. In my own journey, community college acted as the vital stepping stone between my high school years and my time at USC. These are not places of lesser education, as we might have been conditioned to think, and ironically, it would be good for us as a nation to unlearn this preconceived notion and stop acting as our own gatekeepers. 
In applying these observations on a grander scale, the devotion to education is not a dividing factor, but one that unites this nation and this University as a purpose for existing. In the same vein, education means a great deal in my family and, though we may come from a different country, the value of education presents a link between our culture and the one fostered in American society. 
Uncovering the similarities between immigrant values and American values is my purpose for writing this column. During an age of heightened xenophobia, I am devoted to bridging divides and humanizing a vital demographic that may not always be given a name, face or voice. The immigrant experience is a unique experience filled with nuance and complexity that evolves with the changing times. In truth, I’ve just gotten around to unpacking the different facets of it myself and this column will serve as a space to find common ground, highlight shared experiences and discuss social and political factors that affect the lives of U.S. immigrants today. 
More than anything, I’d like to shed light on the many ways in which we are all more alike than different.
