The Women of Troy trailed the Golden Bears early, but thanks to another remarkable performance by senior Monica Vavic, USC was able to rally and pick up their 20th victory of the season.
Cal dominated the first half of the game and would score two straight before freshman driver Brianna Daboub answered with a strike to make it 3-4 in the third.
Then in the fourth, Vavic took control with three huge goals, one of which was a penalty shot to put the Women of Troy up 6-4 with a minute left.
Vavic had a total of four goals Saturday, putting her at 273 for her career and  No. 3 in the MPSF history books, as well as 82 for the season, which currently sits at second in USC single-season history.
Vavic was not the only Woman of Troy member who played well. Victória Chamorro came up huge with some nice deflections during the game.
She received the MPSF Newcomer of the Week award with her performance against LMU, in which she held them scoreless for nearly three quarters and then the next day with five saves against CSUB.
“I would say in comparison to Flor, she is actually further ahead in her freshman year,” head coach Jovan Vavic said.
Going into this weekend, she had 6.6 saves per game and 4.2 goals against per game.
For the most part this season, when the Women of Troy have held deficits into the second half of games, they have lost.
Their two closest games were loses in a defensive battle to UCLA and to Stanford in overtime. Before this weekend, their closest win was 11-7 at UC Irvine, a game that USC controlled the whole way through.
By not only finishing out a close game, but also capping off a comeback with a win,  the team is able to obtain some extra confidence and momentum moving forward.
“Against Stanford we were down by two goals and we came back to tie the game and force overtime,” Vavic said. “Then against Cal, we won the game. Last year, we were not really able to do that, and this year it is a great sign.”
It seems that this year’s team is on the upswing.
Around this time last year, USC was plagued by injuries and lack of motivation. This year’s team is on a six-game win streak, whereas last year’s team lost their last four out of 10 games.
Next on the schedule for USC is San Jose State in their second- to-last game of the regular season on April 11, Senior Day, at 4 p.m.

USC women’s tennis chalked up another two victories on Friday and Saturday, traveling to Arizona and beating No. 41 Arizona and No. 23 Arizona State 5-2 in both matches. With the two wins, the Women of Troy extended their winning streak to eight consecutive games, and they remain a perfect 7-0 in Pac-12 play with an 18-2 overall record.
In Tucson, USC faced off against Arizona and battled to the doubles point. After Meredith Xepoleas and Zoë Katz narrowly dropped the first game, 7-8, the all freshmen team of Gabby Smith and Madison Westby came up with an 8-6 win to even things up.
Finally, No. 15 junior Giuliana Olmos and senior Zoë Scandalis edged Shayne Austin and Briar Preston of the Wildcats to put the Women of Troy on the board.
The team then took control of the match in singles play. Wins from Smith, Katz, Xepoleas and Westby, all without dropping a set, had already sealed the victory for USC when Scandalis and Olmos suffered defeats to make the final score 5-2.
Coming into the game, the Women of Troy had prepared for Tucson’s altitude, but the key to victory was in the fundamentals practiced day in and day out throughout the entire season.
“We didn’t do anything different in particular [during practice],” associate head coach West Nott said. “We just focused on having a great attitude.”
Next, the team traveled to Tempe to take on the Sun Devils, and ASU proved to be tough opponents. Smith and Westby led off doubles with an 8-6 win, but Olmos and Scandalis fell by a score of 6-8. A 5-8 loss from Katz and Santamaria gave the first point of the game to Arizona State.
The Women of Troy fought back in singles, however, winning five of the six contests. Olmos and Scandalis rebounded from their losses against the Wildcats with a 6-2, 7-5 win for the junior over Stephanie Vlad and a 6-1, 6-4 win for the senior over Kassidy Jump.
The freshmen continued where they left off the day before, as each player won her match, highlighted by Smith’s 6-0, 6-0 victory over Ebony Panoho.
The road trip to Arizona was by no means easy for USC, but the team displayed determination and showed why it is the No. 1 ranked team in the nation.
“Adversity is good for the team,” Nott said. “It will help them deal with the pressure better when it comes time for the NCAA tournament in May.”
With a great record and the top ranking, there are not too many holes in USC’s game, and Nott recognizes that the only players that can stop these Women of Troy right now are themselves.
“We need to be completely ready to go mentally,” he said. “That’s the only thing that can really get you into trouble.”
Nott went on to say that he was “really pleased” with the players’ current preparation and play and that the team relishes the challenge of being the top team in the country.
The Women of Troy return home on Friday to face Utah. USC’s final three games of the regular season are all at home, including the matchup against the Utes.
Marks Stadium’s courts play similarly to those in the NCAA tournament, and USC will look get comfortable in that environment in the coming weeks.
Furthermore, according to Nott, playing at home gives the team a better chance at finishing the season with three more wins.
“It’s a huge competitive advantage,” he said. “It’s more comfortable for us, and we tend to play better there.”
USC will face Colorado on Saturday after the fixture against Utah before seeking revenge against archrivals UCLA the next Friday, televised on the Pac-12 network.

As a spectacular March Madness draws to a close tonight, another season of college basketball is in the books. Like every year, this March Madness was filled with exciting upsets, nail-biting finishes, and instant classics between traditional heavyweight programs.
As a Pac-12 fan, it was nice to see three teams represent the conference in the Sweet 16, with Arizona almost overcoming a historic shooting performance by Wisconsin to reach the Final Four.
Other than that, it was equally exciting to watch regional semifinals and finals filled with elite programs and excellent coaches. After a season where critics lamented the demise of college basketball due to over-coaching and a dearth of offensive ability, it was reassuring to watch the execution of high-level basketball in the latter stages of the tournament.
Certainly all of this is exciting as a passionate fan of college basketball, but the absence of USC from the tournament takes away that extra level of enthusiasm that existed for the short period during which they went to the big dance consistently.
Since the Trojans have languished near the bottom of the Pac-12 conference for the past few years, it’s hard to imagine the current team competing in March Madness.
Each year, however, offers the opportunity to spot the hallmarks of great college basketball programs as these characteristics offer a model for USC to follow. Two things that seem to be crucial: coaching and veteran leadership.
Coaching is critical at every level of every sport, but it is magnified at the college level. Of course, there is college football, where Urban Meyer and Nick Saban continuously field two of the best programs annually. College basketball is much of the same. The same coaches are in the mix each year.
This can be partially attributed to school prestige, but coaching plays a monumental factor. Lon Kruger, who currently is at the helm of the Oklahoma Sooner basketball team, has built quality programs at five different schools. Gregg Marshall has turned Wichita State into a basketball dynamo and might have the Shockers competing with the Kansas Jayhawks for the title of best team in the state. Brad Stevens, who previously led Butler to two- straight national championship games, consistently out-coached and out-maneuvered teams with more talent to win deep into the tournament.
Those are talented tacticians who have had massive success at mid-majors and traditional football schools.
When you combine great coaching with prominent programs, you get truly great results.
The Final Four this year was a testament to that fact. Though he may be reviled by most of America, John Calipari has won everywhere he has gone and brought it to scale at Kentucky. Tom Izzo, Bo Ryan and Mike Krzyzewski are all Hall of Fame-caliber coaches who have sustained years of greatness at their respective programs.
The second part of the model of a championship-level team is upperclassmen leadership. With the exception of the Kentucky team that won the title with Anthony Davis and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and the Syracuse team with Carmelo Anthony, every championship team over the last 15 years has been led by upperclassmen. Even this year’s Duke team, which has three future-freshman lottery picks, is buoyed by senior Quinn Cook and a host of older role players. Wisconsin is senior-laden as well, with homegrown talent developing under the careful eye of coach Bo Ryan.
Experience is a difficult statistic to measure and quantify, but it is invaluable in the game of         college basketball.
If USC is to build a top level program, it needs to invest heavily in player development and ensure that most recruits become four-year players.
For an example of a model the Trojans should try to replicate, USC should look no further than former Washington State coach Tony Bennett, who is currently building the Virginia Cavaliers back into a national power.
He is doing it by recruiting talented and hardworking guys who aren’t all necessarily McDonald’s All-Americans. He builds up their game and sharpens their skills while they develop at Virginia, and eventually they become invaluable contributors to the program.
Enfield has only finished year two of his rebuild, so there is still time to see if he can develop into a coach that rivals that of Bennett,  Ryan and the other stalwarts.
A more critical aspect for the USC program is recruiting talented players year in and year out. They don’t have to be         five-star prospects who are one and done, but instead guys who can really learn and develop their skills while at USC.
This seems to be the best way to build a competitive program for the long haul in the current college basketball climate. Hopefully, USC can learn a thing or two from this tournament and accelerate its return to college basketball prominence.

Good to see attention being given to USC basketball.  With a world class facility and a coach who IMO will soon be recognized as one of the best, SC is on the cusp of breaking out.  The current lineup of players is near perfect – highly talented with great potential, but not one-and-done superstars like Mayo and DeRozen.  They are likely to be around for four years and compete at the highest levels which bodes well for a sustainable program the school can be proud of.  The one thing I don’t understand is why Bob Cantu wasn’t retained for recruiting.  He was great at it.

The USC men’s tennis squad played their final home matches of the season this weekend against Pac-12 opponents Utah Utes and Arizona Wildcats.  The Trojans continued their season success against Pac-12 opponents, putting together a dominating 7-0 performance against the Utes and taking down the Wildcats in a 6-1 victory.
On Friday’s match against the Utes, the Trojans came out firing on all cylinders in doubles play, an area where the Trojans have generally struggled this season.  Sophomore Nick Crystal and senior Roberto Quiroz made quick work of Cedric Williams and Matt Cowley, beating the pair 6-1.  Junior Max de Vroome and freshman Thibault Forget clinched the doubles point for the Trojans with a 6-1 victory of their own over the Utes pairing of Johan Jonhagen and Santiago Sierra.  Seniors Jonny Wang and Eric Johnson were in control in their doubles match, leading 5-1 over Parker McGuiness and Jamey Swiggart before play was suspended.
The Trojans continued to dominate in singles play, winning all six singles matches.  In addition, the Trojans didn’t give up a set in singles play and never allowed an opponent to win more than three games in a set.  The first Trojan to finish out a singles match was Wang, who shut out Cowley with a resounding 6-0, 6-0 sweep. Sophomore Rob Bellamy earned the Trojans their third point on the day with a convincing 6-1, 6-0 victory over Sierra.  Crystal followed with a win over Jonhagen by a score of 6-0, 6-1, which clinched the match for the Trojans. Quiroz was the next Trojan to claim victory, beating out McGuiness 6-0, 6-3. Johnson and Max de Vroome wrapped up the day for the Trojans, with both of them beating their respective Utes opponents by a score of 6-3, 6-2.
Before the beginning of Saturday’s final home match of the season against the Wildcats, the seniors on the team were honored with senior tennis memory books.  Johnson and Wang said being honored brought back some great memories of them being on the team.
“It was really great,” Johnson said.  “It’s been an incredible journey with the three other seniors. It’s a really special moment.”
“It really brings back memories, especially from the beginning my freshman year, and how different I am now and how much I’ve grown,” Wang said. “But, what’s stayed the same is the family we have as a team.  I think that’s the most important thing.”
Wang also said what aspects of his game have improved in his time at USC.
“I think almost every facet of my game is improved,” Wang said.  “But what really improved, I think, is the ability to have a plan going into a match and being more disciplined. I think that’s really made a big difference.”        When it was time to get down to business, the Trojans were ready.  The Trojans controlled doubles action, with the seniors single-handedly clinching the doubles point for the Trojans.  Johnson and Wang shut out Wildcats David Mushayev and Jose Zamorano by a score of 6-0, and senior Yannick Hanfmann and Quiroz took down Sumeet Shinde and Trevor James with a score of 6-1.  De Vroome and Forget held a 5-2 lead over Jason Jaruvang and Matt Dunn before play was suspended.
The Trojans had a tougher time winning their sets against the Wildcats, but in four of the five singles matches that the Trojans won, the Trojans were able to win in two sets.  Johnson gave the Trojans their first singles match point on the afternoon when he defeated Shinde in two 6-1 sets.
Quiroz was the next Trojan to declare victory, winning 6-2, 6-0 over Mushayev. De Vroome clinched the home victory for the Trojans with a 7-5, 6-3 victory over Jaruvang.
Wang was the final senior to finish his singles match, beating Will Kneale 7-5, 6-2 and completing a perfect performance for the seniors on their final weekend playing at Marks Stadium.  Crystal ensured the Trojans finished the match with a victory, coming back from a set down to beat James in three sets by a score of 2-6, 6-1, 6-3.
The Trojans will travel to Northern California to take on California and Stanford before returning to Los Angeles to take on rival UCLA before the Pac-12 Championships begin.  Following that tournament, the Trojans will turn their focus to the NCAA Team Championships and the NCAA Individual Championships.
Johnson says that his team members will likely have a slightly different game plan in each of their final matches before the Pac-12 Championships, but he also says the matches will offer an opportunity for the Trojans to fine-tune their games before the Pac-12 Championships and the NCAA Championships begin.
“Everyone has their own individual match and everyone’s different, so you’ll have your own little strategy,” Johnson said.  “But as the last three matches leading up to NCAAs, you’re just trying to fix anything with yourself and just really get ready for the end goal of winning.”

USC baseball  continued its winning ways this weekend by sweeping the University of Arizona Wildcats. The No. 8 Trojans (25-6, 7-2 Pac-12) traveled to Tuscon and won all three games against the Wildcats     (22-9, 7-5 Pac-12) in dramatic fashion.
On Thursday, the Trojans and Wildcats carried a 1-1 tie into the seventh inning, as Arizona starter Cody Hamlin settled down after allowing a run in the first inning when Jeremy Martinez hit into a run-scoring double play.
Trojans starter Brent Wheatley matched Hamlin’s dominance, however, allowing only a solo home run in the bottom of the third against Wildcat standout Scott Kingery. Each starter had to work out of multiple jams throughout the game, as Wheatley worked into the bottom of the sixth.
Head coach Dan Hubbs pulled Wheatley after he got into a jam in the bottom of the sixth, as reliever Brooks Kriske came into the game and quelled the Wildcat threat.
The Trojans finally got to Hamlin in the top of the seventh inning, as a   go-ahead triple from Dante Flores keyed a three-run outburst to put    USC up 4-1.
USC would not relinquish the lead, as Kriske was solid through 3.1 innings pitched, retiring 10 of the 12 batters he faced to earn his second win of the season.
Thursday’s win represented the first time USC has won in Tuscon since 2009, but that was not enough to satisfy the Trojans this weekend.
Friday’s contest featured an offensive outburst for the Trojans unlike any they have seen this season. USC scored 13 runs on a season-high 18 hits to take their second-straight win against Arizona in a game that was over before it really started.
The Trojans exploded for seven runs on eight hits in the top of the first inning. Wildcat starter Robby Medel lasted only one-third of an inning, surrendering after seven hitters combined for six runs on six hits.
USC batted around in the inning, as Jeremy Martinez, Dante Flores and Blake Lacey drove in one run apiece, while Reggie Southall and Bobby Stahel recorded two RBI each.
The Trojans never looked back, as small Wildcat rallies were squashed relatively quickly and retaliated with more USC scoring. After Arizona made it 7-2 in the bottom of the third, USC responded with five more runs in the next two innings to push the score to 12-2.
After the Wildcats touched up reliever Mason Perryman for three runs and scored one off Bernardo Flores, the Trojans scored one more run to account for a final score of  13-6. Flores went 3.1 innings of one-run ball to earn his first save of the year and guarantee a series win for the Trojans.
But again, the Trojans were not satisfied. They came out swinging on Saturday, as they took a back-and-forth 10-9 game over Arizona to complete USC’s first series sweep in Tuscon since 2001.
USC jumped on the board early, taking a 1-0 lead in the first inning on a sacrifice fly from Timmy Robinson.
Trojan starter Mitch Hart was knocked around right away, however, and lasted only 2.1 innings after allowing five runs on four hits. Arizona jumped out to a 2-1 lead in the second inning and added a three-run home run in the third inning by Bobby Dalbec to extend the lead to 5-1.
The Trojans answered right away, putting up seven runs in the top of the fourth inning to knock Arizona starter Tyger Talley out of the game.
The Wildcats went right back to work, as they clawed their way back from the 8-5 deficit. Arizona and USC traded runs in the bottom of the fourth and top of the fifth to push the game to 9-6, but the Wildcats were able to tie the game with two runs in the seventh and another in the eighth.
With the game deadlocked at 9-9 going into the top of the ninth, the Trojans’ tenacity showed once again, as they continued to dipslay they could come from behind on the road.
USC strung together a rally to scratch across the go-ahead run in the top of the ninth inning against Dalbec. Robinson led off the inning with a walk, and Flores advanced him to second on a sacrifice bunt.
Lacey then grounded out to advance Robinson to third base with two outs. Oppenheim then hit a slow roller to shortstop that rolled just under Kevin Newman’s hand to score Robinson and give the Trojans a 10-9 lead.
Reliever Marc Huberman threw two innings of relief and stranded two runners in the bottom of the ninth to lock down the series sweep for the Trojans.
USC returns to the field Tuesday night when they host UC Santa Barbara at Dedeaux Field. First pitch is set for 6 p.m.
It is time to fill Dedeaux Field for ALL of the UCSB (#14) and UCLA (#4) games Tuesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday this week. Grab a beer and enjoy the best Collegiate Baseball in the country!

On Saturday, the Environmental Student Assembly hosted Springfest: Greenfest, a carnival of eco-friendly activities that ran in conjunction with the annual Springfest event.
“Greenfest is the fun, educational portion of Springfest, an interactive program that raises awareness about how we use our energy,” said ESA Executive Director Shawn Rhoads.
The event, which lasted from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m., took place in McCarthy Quad and featured an Energy Playground sponsored by the nonprofit organization Global Inheritance.
Since its founding in 2002, Global Inheritance has encouraged environmental awareness through promoting issues like water conservation and recycling at festival events all over the world, including Coachella, the X Games and the Superbowl.
“We started this partnership last year during ESA’s first year on the USC Program Board Assembly,” Rhoads said. “Greenfest is part of Earth Month, so we want to not only use this program to be a memorable event, but also to raise awareness about the different programs we’ve got going on during the month of April.”
The newest division of Program Board, ESA is dedicated to promoting events that spread awareness about environmental issues and encourage sustainable, environmentally conscious behavior.
“ESA was founded [because] … me and a bunch of other students felt the need to unite the environmental student community because of the lack of community that existed,” Rhoads said. “We can get a lot done alone, but we can do so much more together. That’s something ESA constantly highlights.”
Rhoads hopes Greenfest will help raise awareness about their 21 other events planned for the month of April.
“The greatest thing about this event is that we reach out to so many different people,” Rhoads said. “They have such a diverse lineup this year that we’re going to get types of students that ESA might not normally reach.”
The event offered Springfest, Greenfest and Earth Month T-shirts to those in attendance, provided that they complete at least two energy-generating activities.
“Greenfest has human hamster wheels and other fun stuff like that that students can play on and it will generate energy for a T-shirt screening machine, which we’ll use to make T-shirts,” ESA member Erin Rode said.
Greenfest also offered bikes and seesaws that generated electricity to power light bulbs and cell phones.
“We don’t really think twice when we plug in our cell phones to an outlet, but this is kind of amazing that we’re making people aware of how energy’s really being used,” Rhoads said.
Students in attendance had the opportunity to try the various activities throughout the afternoon.
“I thought it was a really cool way to bring attention to alternative energy in a way that people can be excited about,” said Arushi Gulati, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering. “The hamster wheel was the coolest experience.”
Rhoads has high hopes that Greenfest will continue to spread awareness about environmental issues and be a substantial event that promotes the causes of the ESA and its network of environmental groups in the future.
“We have a lot of energy and motivation that our programs and initiatives can channel,” Rhoads said. “Greenfest is a great way to come together in some way and really just show the university that we want USC to be a global leader in environmental sustainability.”

El Centro Chicano hosted Leah Gallegos, former USC athlete and current member of urban folk band Las Cafeteras, to share the story of her career and discuss cultural and personal identity as part of El Centro’s Friday Power Pan Dulce, a speaker series held at the organization’s Student Union lounge on Friday.
The speaker series connects Latino students and El Centro’s multi-layered community with experienced alumni and Latino leaders for discussions. During the event, students had questions about Gallegos’ career trajectory and personal journey to success.
Leadership, career advice and cultural identity compose the three pillars of Power Pan Dulce that speakers usually address, though El Centro Director William Vela said students take the conversation in various directions.
“It’s really interactive. I ask a few questions to get it rolling but pretty quickly we go to the crowd and it really becomes a conversation dialogue, not a panel or a lecture,” Vela said.
Since transferring from Florida State University to USC, Gallegos has engaged in several different careers: soccer, music, yoga and business. She played on the USC women’s soccer team in 2005, nearly becoming a professional player, and then became director of operations for the USC women’s soccer team soon after graduating with an ethnic studies degree in 2007. Eventually, she left the position to spend more time with the seven-piece band, Las Cafeteras, which was named Best Alternative Latin Band by LA Weekly in 2013 and has toured with acts such as Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros. Still a band member, Gallegos also teaches yoga in Boyle Heights at the studio she co-founded in 2012, People’s Yoga.
Gallegos addressed the challenges of her multiethnic, multi-identity background after growing up in Highland Park with a strong Latino culture and community.  She spoke of being heavily involved in soccer, which she described as “a privileged world; mostly white folk.”
“In this more white world [of soccer], my friends would say, ‘You’re so Mexican!’ and in the Mexican world they would say, ‘You’re such a white girl,’” Gallegos said. “I lived this dual life of going back and forth, trying to fit in over here, and also accepting these identities that were being thrown at me.”
After taking her first ethnic studies course at East Los Angeles Community College in the midst of transferring to USC, Gallegos started to come into her own.
“It was a moment in my life where I understood not only being Mexican-American … but also of being from many worlds. I took this ‘chicanisma’ as being as many identities and none at the same time,” she said.
When Gallegos joined Las Cafeteras, it was just a group of people at a community center that practiced a Son Jarocho-style together. She said the band allowed her to grow in new artistic and personal directions. Five of the seven members of Las Cafeteras, including Gallegos, never made music until adulthood. She said the topics the band writes about also provide an outlet for the members to tell their stories and encourage others to do the same.
“We talk about love, immigration, politics, and what we think is right, just and unjust, and that’s because it’s relevant to our experiences,” Gallegos said. “We travel not only to perform, but also to tell people, ‘tell people your story too’ because we believe that the storytelling practice is an empowering and world-changing practice.”
Power Pan Dulce evolved last year out of a pilot program modeled after other universities’ community-gathering programs. Vela began to introduce notable speakers after the beginning months of the pilot, an arrangement that he says students often engage in with personal stories.
“There’s been some really deep things revealed by a lot of people in attendance,” Vela said. “I feel students have been comfortable with the people we’ve brought and it’s opened their hearts; it’s opened their minds; it’s opened their souls to just express what they’re feeling or what they’re going through and just ask honest questions.”
Brian Vanover, a graduate student studying computer science, sees Power Pan Dulce as a way to keep himself informed.
“It’s important to stay plugged into the Latino community,” he said during Friday’s event.
Annalaura Arredondo, a junior majoring in chemical engineering, echoed these sentiments and believes attending El Centro’s events supports Latinos and helps her learn about how to manage career difficulties.
“It is important to support Latino events since it’s a way to continue increasing the Latino voice,” Arredondo said.
Vela said he is sometimes asked if he brings speakers specifically to motivate students toward social justice. He admitted that though social justice is not necessarily his goal, it does end up being central to the goals of El Centro. He said this comes in the form of helping students understand they should eventually reciprocate resources to the community that once helped them become successful.
“I want every student that comes through El Centro to know that they didn’t just do it on their own and [they have] a moral obligation to give back, but they can do that in any form they want to,” Vela said. “I don’t think everybody needs to work at a nonprofit, [but] I just make sure [people don’t] forget. Other people helped you, so give back; that’s what USC is if you think about it. It’s a Trojan family.”

Marshall School of Business hosted their Annual Showcase in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Friday evening, with a special performance from the Playback Theatre at USC.
The goal of the event was to showcase the work that students had completed during their Global Brigades trip as they helped build sustainable communities in indigenous villages. The majority of the attendees were students who had been on brigades to either Panama or Honduras during winter and spring break, respectively.
The event started with a presentation by Playback Theatre at USC, a form of improvisational theater composed of an ensemble of actors.  The director asked the students who had traveled to Panama and Honduras to share their personal stories, focusing on their individual emotions. The actors then recreated the stories through music and dance.
After the performances, the groups that traveled to Panama talked about their experience teaching financial literacy to a local community.  Within the community were a group of five women who made jewelry and woven baskets from natural resources. The group explained that they had few resources to sell their products properly.
Marshall students helped the women understand the theories behind accounting and taught them basic systems so they could keep track of their sales inventory.  The students also taught the women in the community key English phrases so they could sell their products to tourists and. through group exercises, taught them how to make successful sales pitches.
Garrett Edwards, a sophomore majoring in business administration, was glad to see that his group had been able to make a difference in the community.
“Through Marshall, I learned that business is beyond profits — it’s also about building relationships,” he said. “This intersection between business and culture is really what made this a special experience.”
The Brigades group that traveled to Honduras explained that they had experienced a similar situation.  The community they were helping was in the process of setting up a local bank, but many of the locals had minimal knowledge about how to create a business.
USC students taught them about leadership, community development and social responsibility. The group also held workshops in which they taught the people about business essentials, including finance, interest rates and loans.
Students at the event shared their various experiences to attendees.
Kwan Hyung Kim, a freshman in the World Bachelor in Business program, said his group helped this community take initiative and be confident in doing their business.
“Most of the people there only have education to the sixth grade, so their financial literacy ability is not as far as we would have liked, so we try to help them in that aspect,” Kim said.
The group then shared what they had learned from their trip, which included recognizing the value in learning about other cultures.
Sabrina Wang, a junior majoring in accounting, went on the trip to Honduras and shared how it had changed her perspective about the world.
“It’s like having a new angle to look through,” she said. “For example, if we have a difficult presentation or a project, we will look back at this time, when we had no Wi-Fi, we had no professors or TAs, all we had was each other, our brains and our commitment and passion for this community.”
Kaiti Liu, a junior majoring in business administration, said that witnessing how people in these communities lived was eye-opening for her.
“Seeing the differences in our lives was huge for me,” she said. “I saw that these people are really capable and really smart; they just didn’t have the resources or the knowledge.”
Shashank Agrawal, a junior majoring in computer science and business administration, traveled to Panama with Marshall and went to the event to see what others had thought of the various trips.
“It’s really cool getting insights from both sides and see what they thought of [the trip].”
The event concluded with Global Brigades @ Marshall co-Presidents Kevin Chuang and Joy Xu thanking the Marshall School of Business for their support throughout the year.

The very first scene in Mad Men’s first episode “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes” signaled something special. The camera glided through a smoke-filled bar filled with suited, clean-cut businessmen only to settle on the soon-to-be coolest man on television, Don Draper. He struggled to come up with pitches for an ad campaign for Lucky Strike cigarettes after a recent Reader’s Digest article declared a definitive link between cigarettes and lung cancer. He attempted to strike up a conversation with an African-American server at the bar only to get immediately asked by a supervisor if the “chatty” employee, who had not yet uttered a syllable in response to Draper’s questions, was bothering him. In the next scene, Draper visited the home of a beautiful woman and stayed the night. In the next, three employees at Draper’s advertising firm openly sexually harassed a new female employee, followed by a line of dismissal, “You’ve got to show them what kind of guy you are; that way they’ll know what kind of man to be.”
Right off the bat, the show hits all the notes that would make it such a hit the first few seasons. The hard-partying, womanizing, line-spouting Mad Men (referring to Madison Avenue where most of them work) all show off a ’60s glamor recalling something out of From Russia With Love. Heck, Draper even looked the part with his slick suit and handsome confidence (John Hamm is so handsome that his character on 30 Rock is a man that never learned how to do anything because everything was handed to him for being so good looking). But the show’s appeal was not all ’60s style; it also dove right in to handle issues of the era such as racism, women’s rights and even smoking. Showrunner Matthew Weiner’s brainchild was really unlike anything that had been seen before.
The show was an immediate critical success, winning Emmys for Outstanding Drama Series in each of its first four seasons. Everyone involved in the show’s creation looked as brilliant as Don Draper after an especially moving sales pitch. It wasn’t, however, always such a sure thing. AMC, now the home of mega-shows like The Walking Dead and Breaking Bad, was a small cable network without a flagship show back in 2007. The idea of betting big on a period drama about an ad firm seemed crazy to some at the time. Weiner wrote the script for the pilot back in 2000 and tried to sell it to HBO and Showtime, but was turned down. When the show was picked up by AMC and was immediately a hit, people quickly forgot how much of an underdog the series was as it was starting out. That gamble was huge, and if it had not paid off, the TV landscape might look very different now. If AMC had bet on a different first show, or if it had given less control to Weiner and had much less success right off the bat, then it might have been discouraged to give a green light to Breaking Bad a year later or The Walking Dead in 2010. It may have not even stayed in the drama series game if it had failed right on such an ambitious gamble.
A huge amount of credit for that gamble paying off has to go to Weiner. He was a huge part of the show’s immediate success. The notoriously detail-oriented writer’s fingerprints are all over the series. Having served an important role as a writer on The Sopranos, he was familiar with dominating showrunners thanks to his partnership with David Chase, but Weiner took things to another level. Part of the show’s appeal sprouted from its obsessive attention to chronological accuracy. Every bowl, every lampshade that appears on the screen was vetted to make sure that it was available at the time that was being shown. Every episode is peppered with cultural and political references, large and small, from that point in time. Characters off-handedly mentioned long-forgotten comedy routines and purchase long-discontinued candy bars. The show looks and feels like a time capsule because it is the closest approximation to a recreation of the period that was feasibly possible. If there was any way for the things being shown to be more authentic, Weiner would have sniffed it out and enacted it. Tim Hunter, one of the first season directors, encapsulated Weiner’s style on the DVD commentary from the first season.
“They have a lot of production meetings during pre-production,” he said. “The day the script comes in we all meet for a first page turn, and Matt starts telling us how he envisions it. Then there’s a “tone” meeting a few days later where Matt tells us how he envisions it. And then there’s a final full crew production meeting where Matt again tells us how he envisions it.”
Weiner’s controlling approach, however, was not all fun and games. His exacting demands put a strain on AMC, and through that, put a strain on AMC’s other shows. Weiner’s precise vision led to skyrocketing production costs, including $250,000 for the license to use “Tomorrow Never Knows” by the Beatles at the end of one episode. The song mostly plays over the credits. These costs, and the firm stance Weiner took on them, bullied AMC into squeezing the budgets of Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead when they came along. Some in the business wondered if The Walking Dead’s first showrunner Frank Darabont left due to the monetary restrictions caused by Mad Men’s needs.
Weiner’s abrasive style was dismissed for the first few seasons of the show, as it led to Mad Men shining so brightly. As Breaking Bad emerged from Mad Men’s shadow circa 2011, however, the perception of Mad Men, and Weiner with it, changed somewhat. As the seasons went on, the show became decidedly darker. While Breaking Bad crescendoed to unprecendented popularity in its final half-season, Mad Men has turned into a slow burn. In keeping with his brand of realism, Draper’s prolific drinking and womanizing has caught up with him. Mad Men depicts a somewhat more realistic depiction of the arc of someone who lives life a la James Bond (turns out the likeliest result is not 50-years-and-counting of maintaining the same lifestyle).
As the glossy sheen from the first few seasons came off, some were turned off by the muck that the show now explored. The arrival of a fantasy-action juggernaut in Game of Thrones on the same Sunday slate did not help things. People don’t want to take a mirror to their personal failings when the alternative is dragons, swordfights and sex. Those who have stuck with Mad Men, however, have been treated to an excellent last few seasons. The darkness is not new; it was present from the first episode and grew organically. Weiner’s antics might have taken on a worse light and Med Men’s prestige might have suffered in the last few years, but this show is marching determinedly towards what will probably be an impressive finale, helmed by Weiner.

Shouts and screams rang from McCarthy Quad on Saturday for USC’s annual Springfest. Much to the student body’s chagrin, USC Concerts Committee held back on the complete performance lineup until Friday, keeping students on their toes until the very end. Fortunately, the long wait did not disappoint. Students left their Monday deadline essays and projects to gather on campus for a full day of food, sounds and spirits.
This year, Concerts Committee partnered with Program Board, Gearfest, Environmental Student Assembly, Trojan Pride and Special Events Committee to create a music festival on the quad’s grassy field. The annual Springfest concert exemplifies the collaborative efforts of hardworking Trojans who strive to create an unforgettable event for the entire community.  Those who attended over the Passover/Easter weekend were treated to a familiar environment reminiscent of a small-scale version of the upcoming Coachella festival. With the inclusion of a sizeable beer garden, the nine-hour event provided a festive end to a stressful crunch week.
Eager concertgoers arrived at the event’s opening just to see the various local and big-name artists. Before the performances began, vendors were ready with a variety of festival appropriate clothing for purchase among other items.  As evidenced by the quick depletion of free Postmates’ shirts, a large crowd of early birds flooded the lawn to scope out the festivities and freebies. Goods delivery company Postmates provided the special code “springfest” for first-time app users to try out their services. For tired attendees, the Monster booth provided free cans of Monster Rehab to jumpstart the Springfest experience. For those in need of a food break, Crepe’n Around, The Hungry Nomad, India Jones and the ever popular Boba Truck were presented to provide nourishment for the nine-hour day.
On the SOS lawn, Springfest participants could challenge their friends to an obstacle course or power Global Inheritance’s Energy Playground on a seesaw. The provision of an opportunity to educate people about alternative energy generation represents USC’s commitment to sustainable energy. After partaking in those activities, attendees could receive a screen-printed T-shirt provided by ESA. The Action Zone, hosted by Trojan Pride and Special Events Committee, included the return of the rock-climbing wall and an obstacle course, along with a new wrecking ball pen. Gearfest returned with another amazing fashion show featuring uniquely decorated mannequins.
At 2:30 pm, electronic band WALLA opened up Springfest with an energetic awakening for the fresh crowd. Following them, HolyChild singer Liz Nistico got down and dirty on the grass field, jumping in to perform while inside the crowd pit. The band ended their short 30-minute set list with “Happy With Me,” leaving the crowd with a void that could only be filled by Audio Push and Isaiah Rashad. Audio Push drew in an even larger crowd in the late afternoon with hits such as “Normally” and “Quick Fast.” That momentum was sustained by fellow rapper Isaiah Rashad and surprise guest singer Solana Rowe, otherwise known as SZA.
Around sunset, indie singer-songwriter BØRNS wound down the hyped energy and converted it to a new kind of dance party with fan favorites such as “Electric Love,” along with their own rendition of “Benny and The Jets.” Lead singer Garrett Borns’ impeccable vocal range and blend of electronica and glam rock made a solid set that attracted latecomers from The Row.
Lights were dimmed and the fog machines were put onto overdrive for Portugal. The Man. Despite the complete lack of visibility for a majority of the hour, the Oregon-based indie rock band executed a spectacular show filled with long guitar solos. They began with one of their chart toppers, “Purple, Yellow, Red and Blue,” following with other hits such as “Modern Jesus” and finally coming full circle with a smooth mashup of Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2.” This set end was flawless in its execution as the guitar rhythms are similar.
Tables turned when DJ/producer duo GTA took the stage and revisited some classic and popular songs remixed for the rave-ready pit. Unfortunately many of those songs were choppy cuts of even their own songs and any instance of prolonged intense dancing were cut short at their prime. Surprisingly, they only included what seemed like a 20-second splice of their hit “Intoxicated.” The mix of house and dubstep music confused people at how they should dance since some moments were as awkward as “Fade into Darkness” transitioning to “Peanut Butter Jelly Time.” Still, the incorporation of Daft Punk’s “Hard, Better, Faster, Stronger,” Big Sean’s “I Don’t F-ck With You” and Tinashe’s “2 On” kept attendees bouncing for the rest of the hour before the headliner.
Like every year, the rowdy crowd caused a delay in the performance as a mass swarmed the front of the stage and disregarded official demands to make room at the stage fence. Though the crowd waited half an hour before headliner 2 Chainz made his appearance, his DJ soothed the savage mosh pit with a mix of 2 Chainz’s hits. After 20 minutes, concert-goers were anxious to see the end of the wait, and finally 2 Chainz busted out of the shadows and laid down the law with notable examples such as “Beez in the Trap.” By the end of the show, 2 Chainz proved that he was, indeed, different.

On March 25, the Supreme Court nullified a district court ruling that upheld an Alabama redistricting plan, which loaded up certain districts predominantly with African-American Democrats, in a 5-4 decision. In 2010, when it was time for the State Legislature to redraw the Alabama state district lines, the Republican-dominated body sought to merge the districts with an African-American majority, thereby diminishing Democratic electoral power in the state. Democrats successfully argued that the Republicans were engaging in race-driven, unconstitutional gerrymandering.
Gerrymandering — manipulating district boundaries for the benefit of a certain party — is a common practice in many states. It is an egregious abuse of political power that often goes unnoticed. Consequently, decisions like this one are vital for preserving the democratic health of this country but are substantially lacking in media coverage.
Over the past couple of weeks, two events have been dominating headlines of every major news organization — Hillary Clinton’s email scandal and Ted Cruz’s presidential bid announcement. These events deserve some attention, but the media is now beating a dead horse, with news organizations repeatedly publishing the same story.
Aside from a few short pieces from NPR, no major media outlet has provided in depth coverage or analysis of this Alabama gerrymandering case. By choosing to constantly publish only the click-worthy, big-name stories, the media is depriving the public of information about one of the biggest ongoing threats to our democracy.
A map of Pennsylvania’s Seventh District illustrates the absurdity of gerrymandering and the dangers it poses.
Because of its shape, the district has been dubbed “Goofy Kicking Donald Duck.” It is a comical reminder of the ludicrous looking districts gerrymandering creates. These boundaries have little to do with geography and population density, and plenty to do with political manipulation. It is the primary reason why 90 percent of incumbents get re-elected to a Congress that has a 18 percent approval rating. It virtually solidifies the status quo, which politicians who benefit from these distorted districts often vow to alter.
All of this translates into a weakening of America’s democratic functionality by compromising one of democracy’s most basic elements: choice. Every individual might have the choice to vote for whomever they please, but collectively, gerrymandering exploits political trends to practically predetermine election outcomes. And because state districts also apply to national elections, the political consequences transcend the local and state levels. Gerrymandering has particularly strong implications in presidential elections, which are decided by electoral votes rooted in district outcomes.
Gerrymandering cases often reach district courts and occasionally, the Supreme Court in the years following a redistricting event. Courts have done an adequate job at curtailing gerrymandering in some states.This Alabama decision is a good example of judicial intervention improving the redistricting process. But the courts have not yet provided a true long-term solution to this enduring problem — they can only do so much, and each decision often only affects one state for a relatively short period of time. If people rely solely on the judicial system to deal with this issue, legislatures will continue to find ways to exploit legal loopholes and draw geographically illogical district lines.
The only true solution is to eradicate gerrymandering. But the practice is currently receiving too little attention for that to be a plausible public endeavor, but it needs to become a national issue that receives as much scrutiny as Cruz’s decision to enroll in Obamacare, or the latest rumors surrounding Clinton’s private email account.
For public outrage over gerrymandering to take a national form, the American people must first be informed of the full extent to which gerrymandering is harmful. But as long as the media refuses to provide any sort coverage for something as basic as a Supreme Court gerrymandering decision, the power of the vote will continue to dwindle.

Asking strangers on the street for their opinions on hydraulic fracturing is likely to elicit some blank stares. But asking them for their opinions on fracking will almost certainly evoke adamant reactions. And considering the results of a Pew Research Center poll from November of last year, those responses tend to be negative.
If “fracking” sounds like a dirty word, that’s because in many communities — including the state of New York, which has issued an outright ban on the process — it is. With local concerns ranging from contaminated groundwater to tectonic disturbance, activists have taken to courts and ballot boxes intent on ensuring that fracking does not happen anywhere near their homes. Since fracking also releases a trapped reservoir of earthbound carbon into the atmosphere, opponents have further decried it for advancing global climate change.
Make no mistake, fracking in the United States has rightfully been met with resistance. But rather than an outright moratorium on the industry, which has experienced growth since the mid-2000s, a change in industry practices could yield environmental safeguards, public protection and a necessary bridge towards a clean energy future. As natural gas produces only half of the heat-trapping emissions as coal, we must reasonably pivot toward natural gas as our primary fossil fuel, while increasing our overall reliance on carbon-free energy such as wind and solar.
Among the chief criticisms waged against fracking is the lack of transparency exercised by companies engaged in the practice. Deep below the earth’s surface, shale and limestone formations contain natural gas deposits that formed over millions of years from the decomposition of organic matter. To access that gas, companies pump high-pressure cocktails of water and chemicals into the ground to fracture these ancient rocks, releasing the gas for capture at the surface. Under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has authority to regulate any fluids injected into the ground. According to Clear Water Action, due to a clause widely known as the “Halliburton Loophole,” however, businesses engaged in fracking are not subject to this regulation.
The refusal of companies to disclose the contents of their fracking cocktails, citing proprietary discretion, has drawn immense backlash from communities fearing groundwater contamination. A U.S. survey conducted in 2014 identified several potentially harmful compounds used to fracture deep shale. Some scientists claim to have found known carcinogens and neurotoxins in the mix. Even among those who are skeptical of such claims, there is general agreement that the lack of knowledge and proper research on the relevant substances violates a precautionary principle that ought to be the golden standard in matters of public health. The ingredients of industry fluids should be public information.
The risk of methane leaks is also an inherent problem that must be addressed, as it negates the potential emissions offsets presented by natural gas over coal. Different gases have different chemical and physical behaviors. When released into the atmosphere, methane has the potential to trap 21 times as much heat as the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. A study of wells in the Marcellus shale formation in Pennsylvania found that around 2 percent feature structurally unsound facilities resulting in methane leaks. This might seem negligible, but with tens of thousands of wells currently active in the United States, the collective release of methane poses serious issues as we grapple with curbing global emissions. Well operations and infrastructure must be regulated and held to the highest standards, preventing such leaks from occurring.
Lastly, it must be noted that natural gas, like all non-renewable resources, is a temporary solution. Even in the Marcellus formation, one of the largest natural gas deposits in the world, generous estimates forecast the shale will be depleted within a century. Rather than perpetuate the global energy dilemma, dumping the issue on generations to come, we must responsibly invest in renewable, zero-emission energies and the technologies to harness them.
Austin Reagan is a junior majoring in environmental studies and political science. His column, “The Scientific Method,” runs Mondays. 
Fracking has been in use nearly as long as the automobile. The process reduces the number of new wells to increase production to meet demand. PV is great and its use is growing. However it is not growing fast enough to meet demand. PV is not cheap enough for the masses.  To regulate fracking out of existence is to condemn billions to lesser energy lifestyles. No freedom of movement? No freedom of refrigeration? 
Are you a geologist, Austin? No? Well, you still deserve your opinion, but it is no better than those arguing on behalf of this valuable method of petroleum extraction. You might at least note that the practice has gotten us out from under the boot of Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and other Muslim nations who extort us and hate us. I will take our freedom from dependence on these vile nations as preferable to your environmental concerns.
Why not more solar? PS, fracking breaks the rocks by using bacteria. Review the Titan process of Microbial enhanced oil recovery to start.
Perhaps if you put actual substance into your articles, more people would join in a conversation. Including “what ifs” and “perhaps” as evidence of your conclusion does not make for much to debate. How about an article on the negative attention of biased reporting?
