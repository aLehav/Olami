The Los Angeles Times and the USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics released the results of their first joint poll this weekend, finding that California voters are not pleased with the state of politics in California and believe the state is in a much worse place than the country as a whole.
The poll is the first of six to be conducted by the Times and the Unruh Institute. It also marks the first time USC has joined with a local newspaper in conducting political polls, according to Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute.
“It’s a unique partnership with USC, but more broadly as well, we’re not aware of another partnership like this one between a major research university and a major metropolitan daily newspaper on a public research project anywhere else in the country,” Schnur said.
During a conference call Sunday, Schnur, along with others involved with the poll — including Jane Junn, USC professor of political science, Ann Crigler, USC professor of political science, and David Lauter, assistant managing editor of the Los Angeles Times — openly discussed the results of the poll, a cluster sample of 1,500 registered voters in California.
Republicans, Democrats, and Independents are among those who are wary of the 2010 gubernatorial elections because they believe the new governor will not be able to fix all of California’s problems; self-indentified Independents said they don’t think the next governor will be able to change much.
“Voters aren’t happy in California, but what we noticed is that the unhappiness that is overtly exhibited here is a different type of unhappiness that you see in other parts of the country,” Schnur said during the conference call. “In other parts of the country, voters seemed angry and here in California we see that they are not as much angry as they are disappointed.”
The poll found one exception to this trend of disappointment — President Barack Obama.
Forty percent of voters associated the words “hope” and “pride” with him, exhibiting a positive voter sentiment, and 59 percent of those polled said they would like to elect a senator who will mostly support Obama’s policies, whereas 35 percent hope for a senator who opposes his policies.
Obama’s popularity among these voters, said Schnur, provides a real boost to Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) who is seeking re-election for the state Senate seat.
Many voters also indicated they want a senator who will be willing to take on special interests and reduce government spending.
As far as the gubernatorial race, the majority of Republicans — 32 percent — indicated they would support Ebay founder Meg Whitman in the primary, while the majority of Democrats — 65 percent — said they needed more choices now that San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom has dropped out of the race.
Schnur said he believes Whitman’s popularity has increased recently because of her radio advertising tactics, but he also said the primaries are still wide open — two-thirds of the Republican voters polled said they had not made a choice yet.
“The explanation, if one had to guess, is much more to do with the fact that [some of the candidates] are just largely unknown,” Schnur said on the conference call.
The poll also surveyed voters about the state budget deficit, asking whether the two-thirds majority vote in the state legislature needed to approve a new state budget should be reduced, if sales taxes should be expanded or if there should be a flatter income tax to make the budget. Opinion was split on these issues, though most voters agreed the deficit needed to be addressed.
“The taxes are normally one of the most divisive issues in any political campaign, but most Californians right now are blaming other things for the states problems,” Schnur said.
The Unruh Institute and the Los Angeles Times will come together Wednesday to discuss the results of this poll as part of the institute’s weekly Talk Back lunch series.
Los Angeles Times reporters and editors, as well as the two prominent public opinion research firms — Republican firm Public Opinion Strategies and Democratic firm Greenbirg Quinlan Rosener — will join students and faculty on campus to discuss the polls’ findings.
The Unruh Institute, along with the USC College of Letters, Arts & Sciences, intends to make polls like this a major part of the curriculum. Faculty members, according to Schnur, are revising their syllabi in order to discuss these polls in classes.
“This is a tremendous opportunity for USC students to learn more about how this part of the political process really works,” Schnur said.
The Times and the Unruh Institute will conduct five more polls during the course of the election season. The partnership, which developed when USC approached the Times, will help increase USC’s presence in the political realm, Schnur said.
“This is a survey that’s going to impact the way voters think about the candidates and the way the candidates think about the voters,” Schnur said. “Putting USC in the middle of that discussion has real benefits for the college and university.”
But Schnur said he was most excited about the potential the poll creates for student involvement in the election.
“This raises the ability of USC in the political world to a very significant degree,” Schnur said. “But much more importantly it provides opportunities for USC students that undergrads at most schools simply wont ever have.”

In his 19 years at USC — the second-longest tenure in the university’s presidential history — President Steven B. Sample has been credited with catapulting USC into an era of success.
Higher education experts and others cite Sample’s commitment to interdisciplinary learning, his dedication to global outreach and his yen for fundraising, but those who work alongside him — the deans of USC’s 18 schools — say Sample’s best quality was his humor.

“He just has a twinkle in his eye, and at any minute he can crack you up and the next minute talk about something serious and important,” said Gerald Davison, dean of the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, who has been at USC for about 30 years.
Davison, like his counterparts at USC’s other schools, said he will miss Sample’s jokes at the beginning of his speeches when he is no longer president in August.
“My favorite memory of him is a recurring one,” said Karen Gallagher, dean of the Rossier School of Education. “It was the way he addressed us, the remarks he makes at the speeches, or before the football game, he always starts with a story or joke and then gets serious.”
But most of the deans were not surprised that Sample, who many say has dedicated his life to the university, announced his retirement last week, as his job demands just as much time and work as it does humor.
“Nineteen years is a very long time for any administrator, certainly for a president,” said Yannis Yortsos, dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering. “The job is very demanding. It’s better to quit when you’re ahead than when your energy’s diminishing.”
Sample’s energy, many of the deans said, has never faltered, and despite the demands of his job, he has never seemed to stop caring about each individual school and faculty member.
“You might get a phone call when you needed encouragement — that is exceptional,” said Ruth Weisberg, dean of the Roski School of Fine Arts. “Sometimes presidents can be remote figures — Sample was never remote. You always felt he was not just on your team, he was your captain.”
Randolph Beatty, dean of the Leventhal School of Accounting, said Sample has not only taken the time to talk with his faculty, but he has also taken the time to listen.
“That’s the brilliance of the man. He listens, and so few people do,” Beatty said.
Sample has taken a genuine interest in the lives of his faculty, many of the deans said, making him stand out in their eyes.
“Well I think the time I was most intimately and deeply influenced was when I was at party that he hosted in his home,” said Qingyun Ma, dean of the School of Architecture. “President Sample immediately remembered a lot of details from our interview back in Shanghai, and he remembered my wife’s name, which is a foreign name. We were so impressed.”
Madeline Puzo, dean of the School of Theatre, said she has felt the same personal connection.
“Since I was being considered for an art school, when we were talking, he told me, ‘I was once a professional musician. I never made my living at it, but I got paid to play.’ We began talking about the intimacy of art, the intimacy of performance,” Puzo said. “He lets you feel that he is absolutely interested in what interests you.”
Those musical talents also stand out to some of the deans. Beatty said every year, at an event in honor of Elaine and Kenneth Leventhal, Sample would play drums and invite someone from the group to play with him.
“He’s a very good drummer,” Beatty said. “One year, I got to play drums with him.”
Though his caring and humorous nature has earned him the adoration of the deans, Sample’s vision and leadership has earned him their respect.
“He came into the university and the atmosphere changed. His motto was, ‘We’re going to do things; we are going to do more with less,’” Davison said. “When he came in it was like a shot of adrenaline. I thought, ‘Wow, we are going to be on the move.’”
President Sample has always expected much from his deans and pushed them to be committed to their students, their community, global leadership, research and excellence.
“He showed through example,” said Robert Rasmussen, dean of the Gould School of Law. “He was an advocate for USC.”
Sample has, in fact, led by example. Throughout his presidency, Sample continued to teach leadership classes, launched and promoted his Good Neighbors Campaign dedicated to helping the surrounding community, spurred the creation of the global conference for the Pacific Rim and has made USC into one of the top research universities in the country.
“By maintaining his teaching responsibilities, Sample conveyed a message about what the real priorities of the institution are,” said Avishai Sadan, dean of the School of Dentistry. “[It is] an inspiration that we at the School of Dentistry all follow.”
Sample, all agreed, is a man with a vision. But, more importantly, he has done everything in his power to make that vision a reality.
“His legacy is that what he saw he was actually able to achieve,” Puzo said.
I thought Chemerinsky moved to Duke for family reasons; he didn’t want to raise his kid(s?) in Los Angeles.  But Southern California drew him back to Irvine.  He gets to stay in SoCal, live in a suburban environment for his family, and serve as the first dean to a brand new UC law school.  Doesn’t seem like there was much USC could have done, if anything, to keep him.
Sample was terrific in many ways, but he couldn’t keep Erwin Chemerinsky. Why?

Students planning their classes and budget for next semester will have the opportunity to earn up to $2,500 in rebates for textbooks, fees and tuition paid for in 2009, as part of the Obama administration’s American Opportunity Tax Credit.
The tax credit, offered under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, allows students to receive refunds on $2,000 worth of tuition and course materials — including textbooks, and other supplies. It also allows a 25 percent refund on the next $2,000. The AOTC is an updated version of the Clinton-era Hope Credit that covered $1,800 in tuition and fees, but did not cover course materials.

“This was a provision under the act to help with education costs just like the First-Time Homebuyer Credit was aimed to help with housing costs,” said Victor Omelczenko, an IRS spokesperson.
The AOTC has higher cut-offs than the Hope Credit, so more people qualify than would have before. Single tax payers who make $80,000 dollars or less and married couples who make $160,000 or less are eligible for the full credit.
Although tax credits are usually based on the amount of taxes paid, the AOTC allows eligible students a $1,000 refund even if they don’t pay any taxes.
“The general rule for tax credits is that it can only be used as a subsidy for taxes — if you don’t owe a lot of taxes, you can’t utilize it,”  Edward Kleinbard, a professor at the Gould School of Law and the former chief of staff for the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, said. “Now they have made a refundable credit, which means the government will send you up to $1,000 even if you don’t owe any taxes.”
The credit is also age-specific, offering students older than 24 who support themselves a check for up to $1,000, if they don’t pay more than $2,500 in taxes annually. Younger students will only receive that amount if they pay more than half of their own expenses.
To get the rebate, students must keep a tab of school-related expenses, including saving receipts, to list on their tax returns, according to Kleinbard.
Raymond McDermott, manager of course materials at the Pertusati University Bookstore, said the AOTC, which applies to spending in both 2009 and 2010, might increase sales at the bookstore. While he cannot predict the exact effect AOTC will have on bookstore sales, it could tip the scales for some students struggling to pay for supplies.
“It could be the deciding factor for a student who cannot afford their books,” McDermott said. “It’s one more tool that students and their parents can use to offset their taxes.”
Despite the additional help the tax credit will offer, students said they think it wouldn’t have a huge impact at USC.
“An increase in any tax credit that helps your education is a great thing,” said Hector Rodriguez, a senior majoring in accounting. “[But] even though it’s a large percentage increase from the original, [it] unfortunately reflects a small percentage of what we pay here at USC.”
While the credit is supposed to cover four years of post-secondary education, it will end in December of 2010 unless Congress extends the program.
“I would guess that it would be extended if the money can be found,” Kleinbard said. “The tricky part is that the credit is only available for the 2009 to 2010 even though it’s supposed to cover all four years.”
Students and parents can only claim one tax credit in their tax return, which means other similar tax credits are not available in the same year as a family claims AOTC.
“The basic idea is that it’s better than the Hope Credit,” Kleinbard said. “It would be foolish not to take advantage of this — $2,500 is a lot of money.”

Is there ever a night when your favorite band was playing at the same time as the biggest party on campus? Both events sound amazing, but sadly you cannot split yourself in two and go to both.
But with local band Saint Motel and its themed concert nights, you no longer have to decide between a thrilling concert and a classy party.
That all-too-familiar dilemma vanished on Saturday night when headliner Saint Motel threw a black-and-white themed concert at The Roxy with fellow Los Angeles bands Army Navy, Red Arrow Messenger and Rumspringa.
 Local rock band Saint Motel, which recently released its debut EP, hosts themed shows in Los Angeles. The band’s most recent themed performance was a black-and-white concert at The Roxy on Saturday. - Photo courtesy Saint Motel
This is not the first costumed event, however, that Saint Motel has planned. The band recently finished a residency at Spaceland in Silver Lake, where its concert themes each Monday included sci-fi, erotica, experimental and slasher. These free performances garnered widespread attention for the band, but how could they not? The erotica night even boasted drag queens and exotic dancers.
After its Spaceland residency, Saint Motel kicked off its first nationwide tour, which ended at New York’s CMJ Music Marathon & Film Festival last week.
On the tour, the band members had their tour van broken into in Chicago.
“We got everything robbed: iPods, instruments, laptops and even dirty laundry. But Chicago police is looking [to make] justice,” said AJ Jackson, the band’s lead vocalist and guitarist.
Saint Motel’s band members met in film school during the summer of 2007 and noticed that they not only had similar interests when it came to movies, but when it came to music as well. This translated marvelously into the band’s musical career and its philosophy of blending the two art forms: Saint Motel provides a music video for every song it releases.
“Music is still the main emphasis of the band … We enjoy doing videos, but we definitely prefer working on our songs and playing gigs,” Jackson explained.
As popular as Saint Motel has been in the LA music scene — and for all its talent and personality — it’s strange to see the band still unsigned.  The band, however, has released a debut EP, Forplay, which includes six tracks and their respective videos.
All six tracks illustrate the accessible pop-rock sound Saint Motel is all about. “Eat Your Heart Out,” the first song on the EP, is very reminiscent of The Who’s “Who Are You,” a timeless classic sadly introduced to newer generations only as the theme song of the original CSI.
“Butch” and “To My Enemies” sound happier and overly theatrical, yet entertaining, like songs we heard on the earlier Strokes records — very catchy hooks combined with a friendly voice that invites sing-alongs. “To My Enemies” and “Pity Party” remind us that when The Beatles or Simon and Garfunkel get mixed in a new blender, they always have a way of sounding fresh — kind of what Ezra Koenig and Vampire Weekend did in 2008.
Saint Motel proves that the goals of cinema and music are the same: to entertain. How could it not be memorable to see a great new band in a more intimate show and go to a black-and-white party at the same time?

It may not have been quite what the Trojans had in mind, but they’ll take it.
USC made the most out of two big plays to top Arizona State in an ugly 14-9 win while depending on a defense that had something to prove.
Senior safety Will Harris intercepts a pass in the second quarter, running it back for a touchdown to give USC its first score of evening. - Leah Thompson|Daily Trojan
The first game-changing play came when senior safety Will Harris intercepted a Danny Sullivan pass and returned it 55 yards for the Trojans first score at the end of the second quarter. Then, after halftime, receiver Damian Williams took a short pass and ran all over the field before finally diving into the end zone to cap a 75-yard touchdown pass.
The Trojans didn’t need any more than that, as the defense — which was embarrassed after letting up 47 points to Oregon last week — answered the call and held the Sun Devils to only nine points.
USC coach Pete Carroll said it all started with Harris’s pick.
“That was the huge play in the game for us,” Carroll said.
Harris’s stepped in front of Sullivan’s pass and took it back for the Trojans’  first score, carrying all the momentum with him as well.
“Coach Carroll went back to the basic calls and called man-to-man [coverage]” Harris said. “It was empty, I knew it was empty, so I knew it was going to be quick-game three step, and I hopped it.”
Williams caught a short pass from quarterback Matt Barkley on the right side in the third quarter. While receiving key downfield blocks from his teammates, Williams reversed directions, found open space and dove for the end zone for the score.
“I don’t know that we’ve seen a better play than Damian’s play,” Carroll said.
Williams, who has returned two punts for touchdowns this season, looked like he was in special teams form on the play.
“This guy’s a great open-field runner and it turned into like a punt return,” Carroll said.
The night took a turn for the worst for Williams after that, however. He left the game with a sprained ankle and returned to the sideline using crutches. He was unavailable for comment after the game.
Williams’  long catch was by far the biggest play for the passing game Saturday. Barkley had a forgettable night, going 7-of-22 for 112 yards with one touchdown and one interception.
Not counting Williams’ touchdown, the true freshman threw for just 37 yards.
The offense converted only 2-of-13 third down attempts. The offense was shut out in the first half, putting up only 76 total yards, which Williams just about doubled with his big play.
“As an offense we can always play better than that,” Barkley said. “I don’t know what it was tonight.”
Luckily for Barkley, the Trojan defense was back in its earlier-season form. After getting blown away for 613 yards last week in a lopsided loss to the Ducks, the USC defense checked back in, creating four turnovers and bailing out a lackluster offensive outing.
“To get right and to get back on track defensively is really obviously important to us,” Carroll said. “It’s such a good night to get four turnovers.”
Arizona State gained some momentum from freshman quarterback Brock Osweiler, who came off the bench to replace Sullivan in the second half. Osweiler led the Sun Devils to their only touchdown on a 23-yard pass to Chris McGaha near the end of the third quarter to cut the score to 14-9.
But thanks to the USC defense, that’s where the score would stay.
“The biggest stat is turnovers,” Arizona State coach Dennis Erickson said. “You just can’t do that. You can’t do that against USC or any good team.”
In light of Oregon’s shocking upset loss to Stanford, the Trojans remain afloat in Pac-10 title contention.
“For whatever reason, you guys have amnesia,” Carroll said to media members after the game. “You forget that every year, it ain’t over ’til it’s over.”
After a difficult schedule that had the Trojans play six of their first nine games on the road, USC gets to play its final three games at the Coliseum.
“It’s been quite a ride, from playing in some of the greatest venues in this country,” Barkley said. “But I’m really happy that we’re able to finish this season at home.”
Amazing most teams would sign thier coaches to contact extentions if the only lost two or three games all season yet unless we win out we are less than whol.  Pete has raised the bar but what the naysayers need to realize even rebuilding witht this young talented soon to be good team he managed to beat Ohio state & Notre Dame! Not so bad!  In fact pretty damn good if you ask me.  I love when othwer teams loose one game and go down a few spots in the polls and when USC loses a game we go down ten spots like clockwork.  Almost like there is some contempt for the Trojans and unless you win all of your games the polls look to bury us.  If we are going to be the perrenial gorilla I guess we have to rule the jungle but for just once let’s put our stellar performance by a very talented and very young team into perspective!
I agree with an earlier post that a lack luster season for the Trojans is still a damn good season in many respects. I remember watching the Trojans growing up in the 80s and 90s. Back then, a 9-2 season would have almost surely meant a Rose Bowl birth and a phenomenal season. Pete truly has raised the bar and the level of expectation. Fans quick to criticize the Trojans for losing even one game need to get real. This is a young team that has experienced a number of key coaching changes in the last few years. To do what he does year after year with the constant flux the Trojans experience in personnel and coaching  is  quite an accomplishment. I love the energy and optimism coach Carroll brings to college football. I fear the day he decides to call it quits.
Well, USC won and the injuries before, during and after sustained by the team are really telling.  The win wasn’t typical or pretty, it looked like a one eyed boxer who finally got lucky enough to land some good punches.
Congrats to the defense for hanging in there, as a team you need to get well and get back to work.

Well, glad that’s over.
After pulling out a grinding 14-9 win Saturday at Sun Devil Stadium against Arizona State, the Trojans couldn’t hide their excitement.
USC finally gets to go home for good.

Arizona State was the sixth and final stop on USC’s road schedule, and it’s no secret the team was glad to see it finally come to an end. The Trojans played six of its first nine games away from the Coliseum and paid the price for it with two losses.
“It was a hard part of the schedule, maybe as tough as we’ve ever had,” USC coach Pete Carroll said. “And it just seemed like forever that we were on the road.”
Though Carroll and company may not have gone out with the bang they expected against the Sun Devils, after last week’s debacle against Oregon, they won’t complain. The Trojans were as bad as they’ve been this season on offense and were saved by two big plays and solid defense.
Senior safety Will Harris returned a second quarter interception 55 yards for a touchdown, and junior receiver Damian Williams turned a short catch into a 75-yard score in the third quarter. The defense got back to causing turnovers again and just held on for dear life.
No more traveling. No more hostile crowds. From this point on until bowl season, USC will be happily confined to Southern California.
“I’m really happy to get back home and to get into our same old home routine,” redshirt sophomore linebacker Chris Galippo said.
That routine has been much kinder to the Trojans. USC very easily could have gone 1-5 on the road this season, with Cal being the only win they secured from the start to finish of the game.
Road trips for the Trojans have been a rollercoaster of highs and lows. They needed a miracle last-minute drive to get past Ohio State before suffering a letdown the next week at Washington.
They put together their best all-around performance of the year against Cal, then nearly blew a big fourth-quarter lead at Notre Dame.
They were run out of town in Eugene, Ore., then rebounded with this narrow win in the Arizona desert.
“We paid the price for that along the way here, but now we have to make the most of it and cash in and finish this thing off like we know how,” Carroll said.
It hasn’t been fun. It hasn’t been easy. But the Trojans are relieved it’s at the very least over, and they return to the Coliseum a much more experienced football team.
“We’ve been in these situations too many times,” Harris said. “We don’t get nervous anymore.”
USC’s defense carried the day against the Sun Devils by getting back to its roots. After admitting he took his defensive scheme one step too far last week, Carroll simplified his calls this week and counted on his defense to just make plays.
“Coach went back to the basic calls,” Harris said.
Back to the basics for the Trojans meant more man-to-man coverage and less thinking.
The Trojans also benefited from a few breaks, which have been a rarity on this extended road trip. A Barkley pass was intercepted on USC’s first drive, but the play was nullified thanks to a Sun Devil defensive holding call.
Then, after getting hit, another Barkley pass fluttered into the air and dropped right into the hands of Sun Devil freshman linebacker Vontaze Burfict, but somehow Burfict took his eye off the ball and let it hit the ground.
In the fourth quarter, Barkley was sacked and fumbled the ball, but it was ruled that USC had called a timeout before the play had started.
“That was my all-time favorite timeout call, just before we lost the football,” Carroll said.
On a third down and long on the same drive, Barkley handed the ball to McKnight on a draw play, not even making a serious attempt to get the first down.
McKnight was stopped well short, but Arizona State’s sophomore defensive lineman Lawrence Guy was flagged for a questionable late hit penalty, keeping USC’s drive alive.
So no, USC’s final road contest wasn’t pretty. It was an uneventful, defense-dominated game punctuated by two thrilling big plays. And the Trojans definitely caught some breaks along way.
But after all they’ve been through on the road this season, the Trojans are simply happy they ended it with a victory and keep thankful they won’t have to worry about any travel plans until late December.

Theater is at its worst when it is self-consciously moralistic. The second we feel like we’re being preached to, the experience is ruined.
Regrettably, such is the sorry case of Christopher Piehler’s The Triangle Factory Fire Project, which opened Nov. 5 at USC’s Bing Theatre. The show — the first of two shows this academic year to showcase second-year master’s in fine arts acting students — starts off promising, but is rapidly undone by an exploitative, glacially paced and didactic script that not even capable performances could redeem.
Second-year MFA acting students perform in The Triangle Factory Fire Project last weekend at Bing Theatre. The drama is centered around the historical tragedy that took place in 1911. - Nathaniel Gonzales
History buffs know the story. On March 25, 1911, a fire of unknown origin — possibly caused by a cigarette — broke out in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York City. The factory employed some 500 immigrant workers, mostly women; 146 of them were killed in the blaze. In what seems tragic bad luck, everything went wrong for the women on the ninth floor. The warning came too late, the elevator stopped working, the fire escape collapsed and one of the doors leading down to the safer floors below was apparently locked. They had no escape.
Except out of the windows. Scores of burning bodies rained down on the streets below. A crowd of onlookers watched helplessly; firefighters had no ladder long enough to reach the floor. Women were later found piled up in the elevator shaft and at the base of the broken fire escape.
The Triangle Factory Fire Project is the story of the fire — mostly from the perspective of several of the women (victims and survivors) — and the court case that followed. The co-proprietors of the factory, Max Blanck and Isaac Harris, were charged with manslaughter, but later acquitted.
This play obviously isn’t the first of its kind. History has always been the playwright’s biggest playground. Masters (think Shakespeare) employ the past to inform the present, but are careful never to exploit it for some moralistic purpose.
But Piehler is no master. With The Triangle Factory Fire Project, he sets out to make something meaningful, but falls short. The characters — especially Mrs. Belmont, a feminist leader who rallies the factory women to protest poor working conditions — never let up on the pompous rhetoric. The play is too weighty for its own good; it buckles under the pressure to be significant.
But this might be less the fault of Piehler than it is of this particular production. Indeed, in the “Notes on This Adaptation” section of the playbill, someone (presumably Jack Rowe, the director) writes, “Let’s see: immigration, corporate regulation, women’s rights, the health and well-being of the American worker and outright greed. Sounds a lot like what’s in the air today, doesn’t it? And isn’t theatre still the perfect place to reflect upon our past, to help us discover who we have become and how we treat another?”
Perhaps, but never intentionally. That is the most fundamental mistake in Rowe’s production: trying to provide answers instead of asking questions.
This play wouldn’t be worth seeing if it weren’t for a few fine performances. Nine actors play 29 parts — and remarkably, we are rarely confused. Of course, they put on various accents for each of their characters. Few of the accents are any good (despite the several European countries represented by the immigrant women, most sound vaguely and comically Russian), but they help avoid confusion. The strength of the performances, it seems, correlates with the strength of the accents.
Rafe Corkhill is deeply affecting as Officer John Meehan, trying in a short scene to reason with a grieving mother of one of the victims, probably because his Irish brogue — subtle, not overplayed — is respectable. His European Samuel Bernstein, on the other hand, is unconvincing.
Nobody in the cast stands out, but several of the actors are commendable: Danielle Thorpe, especially in her portrayal of Margaret Schwartz, the factory girl whose story is the most fleshed out; Amielynn Abellera in all her roles; and Joseph O’Malley, who in one role plays a reporter whose experience with the factory fire frames the play.
Amin El Gamal is poorly cast, and overly pantomimic in his caricature of a representation of sleazy factory owner Max Blanck. Eric Schulman is a fine lawyer, and Malika Williams succeeds as Rose Freedman, but not as Margaret’s mother, Bertha Schwartz.
An overall note for the cast: Shouting is not acting, and should not be used to convey emotion.
In general, Piehler has a flair for the monologue — where this emotion comes out — but his dialogue needs work (“Nobody forgives me.” “I forgive you.” “You do?” “Yes.”).
If the first act of the play — recounting the fire from the perspective of the men and women inside the building — is bearable, the second act is nearly unwatchable. The pace, already uneven, stops dead in its tracks with a drawn-out courtroom scene involving petty squabbling over minute points.
Of course, we’re supposed to be appalled that the lives of 146 people have been reduced to such pettiness, but we’re merely bored. The repetition of contemporaneous newspaper headlines to break up the narrative, which start off as an inventive storytelling technique, is dulled by overuse.
In the end, The Triangle Factory Fire Project does not, as Rowe hoped, help us discover who we have become and how we treat another. Some clever storytelling devices and a few nice performances do not hide the fact that the play does all thinking for us, as if we cannot intepret things ourselves. Theater is at its best when it knows that we can.

After going the first 18 games of the season without a draw, the No. 21 USC women’s soccer team concluded its regular season with two ties on the road in cold and wet Washington.
The Women of Troy (12-6-2, 4-3-2) drew 2-2 in Seattle with Washington (11-5-4, 3-3-3) on Sunday afternoon, two days after their scoreless tie with No. 18 Washington State (13-5-2, 5-2-2) in Pullman.
The two stalemates meant USC ended the conference schedule with a fourth place finish in the Pac-10.
“It’s better than losing,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said about the draws. “We took this weekend as a preparation for the [upcoming NCAA] tournament, the travel, the weather and the competitiveness of the two teams we played.”
On Sunday, the Women of Troy grabbed the lead early in the match when redshirt senior Marihelen Tomer sent a low shot from the right wing into the left corner of the goal.
Washington responded less than seven minutes later when senior forward Alex Kirk, who volleyed a cross into goal from five yards out.
USC took the lead again just before halftime on sophomore defender Claire Schloemer’s first goal of the season. Schloemer lofted a shot from 10 yards out over the goalkeeper’s head to put the Women of Troy up 2-1 at the break.
Kirk leveled the score with her second goal of the match for the Huskies in the 51st minute, when she ran to a long pass down the left sideline, cut back on a defender and fired a shot low into the right corner of the net.
Washington had a great chance to take the lead in the 73rd minute when two Huskies were behind the Women of Troy defense. Sophomore forward Alex Webber squandered the chance, however, sending a weak pass across the box that was gobbled up by USC senior goalkeeper Kristin Olsen.
After regulation expired with the two teams tied, the game went into two 10-minute overtime periods.
Sophomore midfielder Carly Butcher had the best chance for USC in the first overtime session, finding herself open in front of the Husky goal but shooting wide of the near post.
Less than a minute later, Washington senior forward Veronica Perez came close to grabbing the victory, putting her shot just wide of the far post.
“[Seattle] had a lot of rain, so it was a really sloppy field,” Khosroshahin said after Sunday’s game. “But we played some fairly good soccer, we just made some mistakes defensively.”
On Friday, the Women of Troy battled No. 18 Washington State to a scoreless draw in Pullman.
USC outshot the Cougars 15-7 in the game but were unable to score on junior goalkeeper Meghan Berlingo, who recorded her seventh shutout of the season.
The Women of Troy played the final three and a half minutes of regulation and both overtime sessions a player down, after freshman forward Samantha Johnson received her second yellow card of the match in the 87th minute.
Olsen made seven saves on the afternoon, including a diving stop of redshirt junior midfielder Mallory Fox’s shot in the 77th minute.
USC’s best chance had come 10 minutes earlier when Berlingo dived to make a save on junior midfielder Megan Ohai’s shot to the far post.
“Washington State is a very good team with a lot of experience, so it was a good result,” Khosroshahin said.”
The Women of Troy will now look forward to the announcement of the NCAA tournament field and pairings, which will be made Monday night at 5 p.m. on ESPNEWS.

There were 4,619 volleyball fans who piled into the Galen Center to watch the USC women’s volleyball team “white out” No. 7 UCLA, but after a five-set battle, No. 17 USC fell 3-2  (25-17, 14-25, 25-16, 17-25, 15-12).
It was USC’s third straight loss.
USC coach Mick Haley has said that this is the best group of Pac-10 teams he has seen in all of his years as a coach, and it is never guaranteed that the Women of Troy will pull out a win. Even with the loss this weekend, the Women of Troy continued to record solid statistics throughout sets.
“We only had four service errors in the whole game, which shows where we’re improving,” Haley said. “We were looking to improve with our blocking, and this game proved that we are getting better there.”
Sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter led the Women of Troy with 22 kills and 14 digs, followed by senior outside hitter Jessica Gysin with 13 kills and 17 digs.
Eichler tied her previous season high of 10 kills, and sophomore middle blocker Lauren Williams had eight kills and five blocks, three of them solo.
Sophomore setter Kendall Bateman had a career-high three kills and finished the night with 55 assists and 10 digs. Bateman is currently leads the nation in assists.
“It was a strange match,” Haley said. “We keep improving, but the conference keeps getting better. I thought when we executed we did really, really well. We just need to focus on the next six matches now and get ready for Washington.”
The Women of Troy began the match well, until UCLA’s outside hitter Kaitlin Sather managed to tie the first set 8-8, and the Bruins took advantage of three straight hitting errors by USC, taking the lead 11-8. After a exchange of solo blocks from Williams and junior middle blocker AudreyEichler, Sather added two more kills, and the Bruins won the first set.
Gysin initiated the Women of Troy’s lead in the second set, and after a couple back-and-forth kills by UCLA’s middle blocker Amanda Gil and Jupiter, Eichler recorded double solo blocks to gain a 20-12 lead, and inevitably win the second set.
The Bruin defense took charge of the third set after Jupiter’s backrow kill had USC trailing by two points at 8-6. UCLA’s blocking managed to give them seven quick points, a 16-7 lead, and eventually a second set win.
The battle was on in the fourth set, as Eichler and Jupiter built a 5-1 lead. A Women of Troy service error allowed UCLA to catch up, but their efforts were not enough, as Gysin’s three kills lead the Women of Troy into the fifth set.
Tied 7-7 in the final set, a ball-handling error called on the Women of Troy put UCLA back on top of the game. It only took a kill from Sather and blocking help from a teammate to allow them to take a 10-7 lead. The Bruins finished it off from there.
USC, however, is not giving up hope.
“We know that we’re not going to stop fighting,” Eichler said.

With mere seconds remaining on the clock, it was a conversation held hours before the match that was the key.
Redshirt junior driver Kyle Sterling scored the game-winning goal as the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team captured a last minute 7-6 victory over UCLA on Saturday.
Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan Good timing · Driver Kyle Sterling was out of rhythm early on, but tuned in just in time to score the game-winning goal to defeat UCLA. - Katelynn Whitaker|Daily Trojan
Planning their attack during the trip to UCLA’s Speiker Acquatics Center earlier in the day, Sterling and sophomore driver Peter Kurzeka discussed a no-look pass to one-timer combination that the two had worked on in practice.
With the Trojans (20-1, 6-0) struggling to find the back of the net against No. 4 UCLA’s strong defense and both Kurzeka and Sterling in the pool for the final minute, USC’s final play of the night turned out to be scripted drama — the two drivers running the play to perfection and putting in the game-winning goal with just 39 seconds left.
“I had had a pretty poor game up to that point, but I kept telling myself that I was going to get the last goal,” Sterling said. “It was just two players being on the same page. We look for that pass all the time. [Kurzeka] just gave me a great pass.”
The fourth quarter had been a defensive struggle, the only offense coming from sophomore two-meter Matt Burton’s second goal of the night, which came from nearly five meters out, equalizing the score at 6-6.
Now it was time for the Trojans to turn that defense back on for one final stop.
After USC senior driver Matt Sagehorn was called for exclusion with 25 seconds left, the Trojans had to stop the Bruins down a player. All night, both teams had capitalized on six-on-five possessions — in fact, during the first half, neither team scored during full six-on-six action.
With just four seconds left on the clock and UCLA senior Scott Davidson — who already had four goals of his own — lining up a shot, USC senior driver Anthony Artokovich made a game-saving field block.
“There’s nothing you can really do to prepare for that situation, just show your hands,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said of the last second situation.
The man-up advantages were key all night.
In the first quarter both Burton and Davidson scored almost immediately after exceptions were called on the other team.
It was not until early in the second quarter that an advantage was completed without a team scoring a goal, when the Trojans forced an outside shot from the Bruins, handled well by sophomore goalie Joel Dennerley, who finished with 10 saves.
“Both teams played very good half-court team defense,” Vavic said. “You really don’t want to give up a goal [on an advantage]. The goal is to try to avoid giving up that extra shot.”
Vavic got his wish a few more times during that second quarter, as the Bruins were unable to capitalize on two more advantages, including one right before the end of the half.
The third quarter turned into an offensive affair, as six goals were scored, more than double the offensive output of the first half of play. Davidson recorded his third and fourth goals, while the Trojans added scores from Burton, senior two-meter Shea Buckner and Sagehorn, who scored on the game’s only fast-break conversion.
The Trojans can now turn their attention to No. 3 Stanford, who travel to McDonald’s Swim Stadium Saturday for both teams’ penultimate MPSF game before the postseason begins.

It’s a safe bet that when the Ronald Tutor Campus Center opens its doors next fall, you’ll be scoping out the new cafeteria’s selection. But URBNMRKT, the latest eatery from Trojan Hospitality, probably flew right under your radar.
That’s because even though URBNMKRT is classified as a University Park Campus retail café like Café 84 or Literatea, it’s situated well off-campus on Grand Avenue. But don’t let the stigma of the east-of-the-110 district scare you off — URBNMRKT is a facet of student dining never before unveiled at USC, and it deserves to be experienced.
URBNMRKT serves fresh sandwiches and salads daily. - Vicki Yang|Daily Trojan
Plopped on a ghost town of a city block, the entrance is easily missed if you visit outside lunchtime hours, when a complimentary valet stand dots the otherwise deserted sidewalk. Not that you particularly need the valet; this section of Grand Avenue is lined with free and vacant parking spaces — an anomaly in LA.
Once you do notice the eight oversized letters stamped across the eatery’s floor-to-ceiling tinted windows, you then stumble into an oasis that is shockingly trendy and friendly calm. The sterile and the natural are juxtaposed with that sensibility that has come to define Pacific dining.
Concrete floors, soaring ceilings crisscrossed with bare ventilation, half-frosted bauble lamps dangling from cords and padded cement booths tucked in the skeletal remains of a loading dock lend themselves to an industrial openness. A court of wooden tables, stools like massive chopping blocks and a dominating print of what might have been tree trunks before the artist upped the contrast, evoke freshness.
Circle around the coffee bar to the marketplace area and you’ll find that it’s no different, contrasting stainless steel with containers of whole, fresh produce such as apples, which you can purchase, and carrots, which you cannot.
Add all this to the bank of angular couches, floor lamps and rugs that set off a lounge area, and you get the distinct impression of having walked into an oversized loft. (Whether the introduction of Wi-Fi will turn it into the ideal study haunt remains to be seen.)
If the atmosphere alone isn’t enough to distinguish URBNMRKT from other campus restaurants, then the food certainly is.
The menu is composed of inexpensive salads, “hot lunch” selections such as BBQ pork shoulder with crunchy slaw ($5) and mustard glazed salmon with quinoa pilaf and herb salad ($7). There are also cold sandwiches and wraps, soups — including a soup of the day and vegetarian lentil soup — and “a.m. eats,” such as a breakfast burrito ($3.50) and the medium coffee and 12 oz. oatmeal combo ($3).
The full-service espresso bar is complemented by a case of chewy chocolate chunk cookies and foot-long cinnamon twists along with a veritable tea chest of Mighty Leaf blends. Kettle chips, pickles and fountain drinks wait to be added to your sandwich combo. Two open, full-wall refrigerator cases house fresh fruit cups and parfaits, Martinelli’s apple juice, Naked beverages, sodas, Tejava and pre-prepared salads and sandwiches, in case you’re in too much of a hurry to customize.
But perhaps the best thing about the little strip of menu is that it’s more like a set of guidelines than the ingredient ultimata you find in prix fixe fare or even at The Lot. The super-accomodating kitchen staff is happy to substitute in red onions for fried wontons, throw havarti on your sandwich or fresh avocado slices in your wrap for no extra charge.
For this reason, it’s not too concerning that the leafy greens salad ($6), of soft, fresh mozzarella cubes, diced tomatoes, seasoned croutons, spring greens and a fresh basil sprig coated with thick vinaigrette, was lacking in sugary “vinaigre” and overpowering in peppery, salty “tte.” Or that the vegetable wrap ($5), of sweet peppers, shredded lettuce and hummus, soaked through its store-bought flour tortilla wrapping within minutes of assembly.
Or you can just scrap the menu, put together whatever you like the first time around and pay based on whatever your meal most resembles.
Also, well-executed standbys like the carne asada burrito ($5) with tender bell peppers and steak soaked in a thick, spicy marinade, and the Pacific Rim chicken salad ($6), of leafy greens, grilled white meat, green onions and fried wonton noodles shaken with a soy sauce-based dressing, prove that many menu items give Wolfgang Puck Express a run for its money without any alteration whatsoever.
You just have to keep reminding yourself that you can pay with discretionary money, since the few streets traveled to get there make URBNMRKT feel miles away from typical on-campus fare.

Our mothers might say our quirks are what make us who we are; they give us “character.”
Unfortunately, some quirks aren’t so charming and can sometimes manifest themselves as bad habits, which are notoriously hard to break. Sometimes, they are so deeply ingrained in a person’s behavior that turning them off is a nearly impossible request.
I’ve witnessed some people have habits in the workplace that are merely peculiar, like one seemingly sophisticated manager who found nothing disconcerting about typing with one finger in a professional environment. Other habits are so bad that they begin to affect, and subsequently irritate, the people around us.
We’ll call one particular attorney Chatty Kathy, because of her inability to respond in a traditional manner to the social cues that typically mark the normal end of a conversation.
Every morning, after a couple bottles of water and several cups of coffee, I would make my routine trip to the ladies room to break the seal. Seeing your co-workers in the bathroom is inevitable, but often annoying because it forces you to make small talk in one of the least comfortable environments imaginable.
While Chatty Kathy was touching up her lipstick in the company bathroom, I gave her a polite hello before making my way in the bathroom stall. I wrongfully presumed that once I locked the door, the conversation would cease.
Instead, Chatty Kathy took this as a signal to push the conversation into full throttle. At the very moment the stall door locked, she would start going off about where her three sons go to day camp and how this camp is a perfect match for them, but how she still feels bad about sending them off each day, etc.
But I had never met her sons nor had I ever been to summer camp, so I couldn’t make out what, exactly, made me a prime target for her rambling. With every drawn-out syllable she uttered I was one step further from relieving myself and getting back to work — such is the life of a shy pee-er.
But female bathroom-goers weren’t the only victims of her chatty ways. My cubicle was positioned directly outside her office so I witnessed many times her inability to end a conversation after a socially recognized cue — a co-worker’s “goodbye” or “thanks” or turning around and exiting her office. Often after the unknowing co-worker freed himself from her dungeon of prattle and made it halfway down the hall, Chatty Kathy would either resume the previous conversation or start up a brand new one.
The escaping co-worker would start walking back, finish the conversation, walk away and then begin the whole frustrating cycle once more.
Even the seemingly normal employees let their bad habits gets the best of them at the office. An attractive young partner was well-dressed and put-together, yet her secretary frequently complained of the boogers she had to chisel off of the woman’s paperwork before being able to send it to the court in good conscience.
But the most disgusting of all employees was a misogynistic, first-year attorney with a face not even a mother could love. Before earning his tenure and paying the necessary dues, he began treating his office like his own personal bathroom.
This man had no problem passing gas, picking his nose or scratching his groin — all with the door wide open. In fact, he cared so little about discretion that he’d even invite people into his office while engaging in one of his filthy behaviors.
With all of the stress that accompanies a career, it’s understandable that moments of heightened anxiety will sometimes cause these bad habits to rear their ugly heads. It is not easy to resist these regressions to childish behavior when under duress, but it’s important to do your best to prevent your co-workers from catching you in a moment of weakness.
If someone spots you sitting at your desk, plucking out eyelashes while racing to meet a deadline, they’ll understand. Just don’t forget to close the door.
Other times our so-called “quirks” have become such a part of us that we start losing the ability to recognize that they’re unusual at all. In these cases, we need someone with a little tact to tell us everything our mothers never had the heart to tell us.
In the case of best behavior vs. bad habit, it is the judgment of this column that you should be sentenced to a life term of office oblivion should you refuse to recognize, rather than address, your veritable vices.

There are very few Californians who still approve of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger — at least when it comes to politics. That’s why the state’s upcoming gubernatorial race has sparked such a wide range of responses.
Some are excited, hoping for change; others indifferent, knowing that no single person could possibly undo the vast array of problems facing the state.
Matteo Marjoram|Daily Trojan
Either way, last week’s mayoral and gubernatorial elections on the East Coast serve as a barometer for sentiments around the country, showing that, despite California’s strong blue background, the Democratic Party will certainly face many trials in the coming months.
Any potential Democratic candidate will have to fight the country-wide disillusionment with the party, an issue that plagued Virginia and New Jersey in their elections last week. Party fatigue is a common complaint in the months after new leadership moves in, but it will be especially fierce this electoral season if the economy does not improve.
All of the major gubernatorial candidates firmly reinforce the status quo in some respects, coming from backgrounds of high politics or big business. Yet they will be forced to face highly politicized debates, many of which are uniquely Californian in a way that will make this election, once again, one of the most watched around the country.
Jerry Brown, who is widely held to be the strongest Democratic contender, is the popular California attorney general who has already served as state governor in the past. Meanwhile, former eBay CEO Meg Whitman sports a strong lead over every other Republican hopeful, reinforcing the union between big business and politics.
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom was the only aspirant who really came from off the beaten path, but his campaign ended before it even began. While the 2010 ballot has yet to be finalized, his withdrawal from the race shows that, in these troubled times, Californians aren’t willing to take the risk of backing a candidate who hails from a less-than-probable background.
A variety of the campaign issues promise to deal with hot-button topics — not the least of these is the potential of legalized, taxable marijuana.
Marijuana sales could bring in billions of dollars in revenue, but could also create a host of problems, from policing to border policy. An overwhelming 38 percent of Californians are in favor of a legalization measure, which perhaps speaks as much to the state of the economy as it does to Californian counterculture.
Another important point will be the candidates’ position on same-sex marriage. It’s unlikely that any of them will be naive enough to pull a Carrie Prejean (see last year’s Miss America competition), but they will have to tread carefully to avoid alienating themselves from supporters on either side of the gay marriage debate.
Newsom’s image as “just” a same-sex marriage supporter was one of the main reasons for his downfall, which stands as a testament to the fact that either extreme is too extreme for a state as large and diverse as California.
But regardless of their stances on these issues, the main campaign promise for any candidate must surely rest upon the sobering reality of economic policy.
As the state grapples with rising unemployment, it is also forced to deal with falling income taxes. This problem hits harder here than in most states, with income tax making up 55 percent of state revenue.
Candidates will also have to fight hard to convince voters that their particular remedies will actually provide the solution that California so desperately needs.
And then there are the perennial problems of overcrowding in prisons, natural disasters and immigration.
Apart from these local challenges, the candidates will also be dealing with many of the problems that have broken past electoral competitors across the country. For instance, Brown is 71; while Sen. John McCain was admirably sprightly throughout his campaign, no one would hesitate to admit that his age was a compelling factor in his loss last November. Brown will face the same reluctance in the face of a younger opponent.
Only time will tell what scandals or surprises may rock the candidates’ campaigns over the next few months. But more important than these individual issues will be the state of the economy and the new health care bill. These are two highly volatile issues for which no single candidate can provide a solution, but for which they will all certainly be judged. If there’s one thing everyone can agree on, it’s that the Democratic Party has a tough fight ahead of it — even in California.

In today’s politically charged climate, a pundit doesn’t have to have the polarizing personality of Ann Coulter or Keith Olberman to spark a contentious debate.
Commentators whose views do fall very far to one side of the political spectrum or the other still have the enviable position of sparking an open debate, but only if both sides are willing to do more than shout across a divide.
David Horowitz’s invitation to speak on campus last week — sponsored by the USC College Republicans — had the potential to do more than simply create a division. Unfortunately, neither constituency of students — those in favor of his visit, and those opposed — recognized the opportunity for dialogue, leaving both sides with backs turned and eyes closed.
The announcement of Horowitz’s visit incited a firestorm of opposition from a number of student groups — from Students for Justice in Palestine to Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation — all of whom felt the university owed it to its students to bar the speaker from campus, citing intolerant views that don’t jibe with USC’s policy of nondiscrimination.
The USC College Republicans’ response was to bar some students from attending the event, because of a “concern regarding the safety of [their] speaker.”
Wednesday night’s speech brought with it a tableau all too familiar to the world of politics. Protestors who were able to gain entry stood up during the event, turned their backs on Horowitz and were promptly ushered out by Department of Public Safety officers. Outside, protestors shouted and gestured, touting signs with slogans like, “His hate speech is violating my free speech.”
Horowitz imparted his views on students who were already set to agree with those perspectives, and few came away reassessing their convictions.
The USC College Republicans had every right to turn away protestors as a private campus group and the financiers of the event — that much is certain. As a political organization, however, they shot themselves in the foot by not fostering a more open debate.
Groups that wished to bar the figure from campus were equally stubborn.
Ultimately, both sides had an opportunity to create an open debate, and neither side chose to pursue it. After all, political conversation requires just that: conversation. Two discordant groups of students shouting over each other produces nothing more than a cacophonous din.
Hopefully, in the future, when controversial figures are invited to campus, their presence will promote an organized conversation about political ideologies. Both groups can listen to the speakers, after which they can discuss — through a sponsored forum — their ideas.
If this event proves anything, it is that when opposing parties are content to let ideological divides prevent productive discourse, all that remains in the middle is anger.

This article is absolutely typical of liberal media’s pattern when responding to conservative ideas.
Step 1: Behave like animals. Kick, bite, screech, scream, disrupt others speech by any means necessary.
Step 2: Write articles insisting that it was all the conservatives’ fault because they were racists or something.
Step 3: When people call you on your asinine behavior, fall back to the argument that “Well, both sides are just as bad”.
Both sides are not just as bad. America is waking up to the rhetorical tricks that have served the left so well since they killed JFK and replaced him with Saul Alinsky.
Ali,
What’s your deal? What are you trying to prove about yourself?
Sorry about the link not coming through.  It was a BBC interviews with a Muslim who attended the same mosque as Hasan did.  The interviewed Muslim praised Hasan as a hero.
I suppose the Left believes Hasan was driven to it by this, that, or the other thing, but they would never, ever say it was because Islam is a supremacist religion founded by a facist who practiced and preached about the need for Islam to conquer until there were no more free non-Muslims.
Yeah, it’s Israel’s fault.  That is why 4,000 Buddhists have been murdered by Islamists in Southern Thailand.
Again, sorry the link did not come through.  It was amazing to hear what this Muslim had to say.  Just as Horowitz described.
I hope the following link comes thru:
Muslim at Islamic Community of Greater Killeen, Texas: “I honestly have no pity” for victims of the Fort Hood jihad
If it did this is the sort of Muslim Horowitz spoke about.  I could send you a thousand more links just like this.
Horowitz spoke the truth and the Left is too busy blaming America for everything because, well, because it makes them feel better about themselves.
Left Wingers are typically pious. And their religion is devoid of Reason.
They think (FEEL) that they know more than others, so they get (FEEL) upset when others question their premises in a rational way, as did David Horowitz. Because Lefties are partisan ideologues, they emotionally have to silence those around them who disagree with them. They cannot engage in rational debate, because, if they do, they know, from experience, that they will lose.
Listening to someone emotionally vent their pent up feelings is like being next to someone with “bad breath”. They are walking volcanoes, full of anger, frustration & hate. And they have to turn the tables on rational people as a strategy  to deflect criticism of their emotionally held convictions. Pathetic.
It’s really just a matter of Feeling vs. Reason.
Lefties in this country are really no different than the Muslims in other countries with their fists in the air, shouting hateful, angry speech & putting others (including their own wives) into prison-like submission.
After all, what does “Islam” mean? You got it. SUBMISSION.
Lucy attempts to place herself in the “sane middle” while ignoring a few inconvenient truths:
Conservative speakers are often not ALLOWED to express themselves at campus events when protesters are given their “full right of expresssion” (a simple Google search can net you this information). Conservative speakers have been forced to cut short remarks, move to different locations, attacked by students hurling items, and cancel speeches — all because discourtesy and incivility are apparently not only acceptable but desired traits in left wing protesters.
Proof: Read article, above. The Lefties wanted to PREVENT student from being able to hear or discuss Horowitz’ views. Get that, Lucy? The College Republicans were TRYING to foster an open expression of ideas, and the Lefties wanted to STIFLE it.
So, the CR was forced to take action to try to allow Horowitz the simple courtesy, offered to so many controversial speakers on the Left, to express his viewpoint in a civilized forum.
Both sides did not miss the boat here, Lucy. Make no mistake; only one side is devoted to eradicating free speech, as your own depiction of the goings-on attests.
I just.. doubt.. this person has ever been to one of these types of events.. ever…
