This Monday marked the 45th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision, a ruling that made abortion legal on the federal level. What preceded the Roe decision was a dark age for women; in the many states that had not legalized the procedure, socioeconomic status and the government had the unilateral power to force a woman to give birth, or subject her to the cruelty and danger of a back-alley procedure. In a society where abortion is illegal, those are the  only options available to women who lack the privilege of being able to receive education about or afford birth control. And historically, the women who found themselves caught in this trap were often low-income women of color and immigrants. 
Forty-five years later, we may never know how many died or were severely injured while having unsafe versions of the procedure in parts of the country where abortion was illegal, nor how many women were deprived of opportunity from being impelled to go through with an unintended pregnancy. 
Today, “Never going back” is a defining slogan of the abortion rights movement because it acknowledges the past that we as a country have progressed from. 
Last summer, Oregon’s female governor signed into law a bill that ensured insurance coverage of abortion for all, including undocumented women in the state. Last fall, Illinois’ notably Republican governor signed into law a bill ensuring low-income women and government workers received insurance coverage for abortion. Last week, California’s state Senate Education and Appropriations committees moved forward a bill that would require the state’s public colleges to offer medication abortion services. Since the Roe decision more than four decades ago, different parts of the country are embracing progress; every Jan. 22, it’s important to celebrate the landmark decision that made this progress possible.
And yet, the anniversary of the Roe decision must also serve as an annual reminder of how much work there remains to be done. Perhaps fewer women are dying from botched back-alley procedures, but the fact that this phenomenon persists 45 years later is concerning.

In 2018, 87 percent of U.S. counties lack an abortion provider. The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate in the industrialized world, and states with more restrictions on abortion have even higher mortality rates. Abortion restrictions have detrimental consequences for women’s health, in general, but disproportionately affect women of color: Black women are 243 percent more likely to die of pregnancy or birth-related causes than their white counterparts. 
Across the country, a quarter of all of the more than 1,050 restrictions on abortion enacted since Roe were passed in the five years between 2011 and 2016 alone; they range from bans on the procedure at different stages of the pregnancy to costly mandated waiting periods and counseling. The 42-year-old Hyde Amendment and myriad state laws across the country bar insurance coverage of the procedure, rendering basic health care virtually inaccessible for low-income women. 
Barriers to access extend beyond anti-abortion legislation. Between 1977 and 2015, anti-abortion extremists engaged in more than 7,200 reported acts of violence against abortion providers, ranging from death threats and assaults to bombings and arson, according to the most recent data from the National Abortion Rights Action League. 
Even as abortion enters its 45th year of legality, this trend persists, and even appears to be on the rise. And while the internet has helped circulate crucial women’s health information to more women around the world, it has also fostered the circulation of dangerous propaganda about the procedure, such as the disproven lies that abortion causes infertility, breast cancer or post-traumatic stress disorder, effectively stinting women’s right to make informed choices about their bodies. 
With few exceptions such as Gov. Rauner and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, Republicans across the country have constructed their platform around demonizing and dismantling access to abortion and reproductive health care — all while Democratic Party leadership attempts to distance the party from the controversial issue. 
Today, minors, undocumented women, trans and gender-nonconforming people, low-income women and women of color still face far too many obstacles to access a basic medical procedure; the technical legality of abortion has only symbolic value for these groups. For feminists, the fight must continue until everyone has access to abortion without stigma or undue burden. 
Rather than be daunted by all the work that remains to be done, we should rise to the challenge. 
With every election, we have the opportunity to elect lawmakers who will fight for reproductive rights and impact real change. And in 2018, with midterm elections on the horizon, we could soon be celebrating not only Roe’s 45th birthday, but also the start of a new era of choice.

So, now the DT is censoring contrary opinion?  They deleted my post from this morning, and it was not vile, hateful or vulgar.  But it was contrary to the liberal ideology of legal genocide.
I’m not surprised that they would delete a post that is contrary to “popular opinion.”  One would hope that a university would encourage open dialogue, which would obviously enhance their students’ education.  Instead, they redefine contrary viewpoints as being “hate speech” and quash them every chance they get.  Killing millions of unborn children is certainly a form of genocide, but in their minds they are not human, so no harm, no foul.
You’re dreaming up straw men to have something to target.  There is no trending that indicates threats to women’s rights.  You can kill your offspring any time you choose without obstruction.  The only debate centers on funding.  Simply stated, if you want to kill a/your baby, then fine, go ahead and do so, but don’t make me or others pay for it.  It’s all on you. Being equal to men means you have the wherewithall to cover your own costs in life.  Stop whining.  Grow up and act the WOMAN!
Justify abortion all you wqnt. The fact remains the founder of Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger, was a racist whose goal was and remains today to reduce the number of blacks Americans in this country. Don’t take my word for it, look it up yourself. But check out the pro life sites too, not just a quick Google search. Google search algorithms are tainted.
The sad thing is women today have been brainwashed into believing that killing your unborn child is socially acceptable. It is not. Over 230,000 babies are ripped from their mother’s womb every year, and how many of them are girls?  The Woman’s Lib movement promotes girl power, but is aligned with abortionists that kill so many female babies who never get a chance at life outside the womb. How barbaric is this behavior and law?
Genocide is murder no matter how you justify it. Think about it.

Earlier this academic year, USC’s press office released an article headlined: “USC’s freshman class sets record: More first-generation students than ever.” My immediate response was, “This is great, but where are the resources to ensure these students are successful?” 
As an advocate for first-generation college students, I believe there is strength in numbers, and it is admirable for an elite institution like USC to offer these students a chance that their parents never received. But recruitment is only one piece of the puzzle. Retainment and long-term success is where USC needs to improve by providing academic support and resources that help these students to be successful both inside and outside of the classroom.
USC administrators don’t seem to understand this. On Jan. 5, Provost Michael Quick announced an effort to increase support for more first-generation students by expanding the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund. The memo failed to mention that with said expansion, USC would cut the Director position and instead have the scholarship overseen at a higher level by Dr. Andrea Hodge, USC’s Vice Provost of Undergraduate Programs. It is a classic and misguided attempt by USC trying to increase numbers while simultaneously decreasing support. 
In his memo, Quick notes the Topping scholarship, “has helped scores of underrepresented, low-income and first-generation students attend and thrive at USC. It provides a community for scholars who receive mentoring, special programming and advising — all aimed at supporting academic success.” I question if the same will be said of the scholarship in the future. 
During my first semester at USC, I struggled with impostor syndrome. I constantly felt like the only person in the classroom who didn’t understand the material and wondered if I deserved to be there. I struggled with grades and my self-esteem.  But Christina Yokoyama, NTSAF Director, didn’t let me fall through the cracks. I received an email from Christina after I failed my first midterm. I was ashamed to tell anyone, but Christina understood what I was going through.
It was this support from NTSAF that helped me thrive thereafter. From visiting Japan with NTSAF my freshman year to becoming Undergraduate Student Government President, nothing I have accomplished during my tenure at USC would have been possible without the support I received from NTSAF. Most recently, I was named a Schwarzman Scholar, giving me a full-ride at Tsinghua University in Beijing. One of the first people I called was Christina, whom I thanked for supporting me when I was at my lowest point academically. 
I worry the future of NTSAF will not support its students in the same way. While the scholarship is completely student-funded and mostly student-run, USC administration failed to consult the NTSAF Governing Board —composed of students, staff and alumni — or any student that is currently part of the program. 
NTSAF is not just another scholarship — it’s a support system and network with experienced staff aiming to help first-generation low-income college students excel academically and professionally. Topping Scholars have been featured in the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times. They have been named Truman Scholars, Schwarzman Scholars, Rhodes Scholars and Fulbright Recipients. And they have shown their involvement across campus by becoming presidents of Greek life organizations, holding executive board positions in USG, writing for the Daily Trojan and participating in a wide range of community service organizations.
If administration is truly committed to growing the support and success of this scholarship to more students, they would start by investing more resources into the program instead of chipping away at what students have left. In 2014, administration moved NTSAF from a large office space to a smaller, more cramped space. In 2016, they cut key programming such as the annual “Eggster” community service event, an Easter egg hunt for children living around USC. In 2017, administration cut the Japan Summer Immersion Program, the program that opened my eyes to the world. And in 2018, they are cutting the NTSAF Director position halfway through the school year. 
I fail to see the administration’s commitment to “better coordinate our support for the Topping program, financially and academically.” Students should be concerned not only for their fellow Topping Scholars, but also for what these changes can mean for the future of our University. In these times of turmoil and uncertainty at the national level, administration is stripping away support from those who need it most. USC’s goal of enrolling more first-generation and minority students is being undermined by the cuts in funding and support. USC needs to realize they can’t have their cake and eat it too.

Bill Dess, known to the world through his music under the name “Two Feet,” brought his music to the El Rey Theatre on Tuesday, and impressed the crowd with a relatively invigorated performance compared to previous concerts. His close friend, rising musician Absofacto, acted as the concert’s opener, while singer-songwriter Naomi surprised the crowd with a guest appearance. 
El Rey Theatre is a dimly lit, elegant venue filled with trendy L.A. locals nearly every night of the week. Two Feet’s concert was no exception, having sold out their Tuesday night show. 
Absofacto, the stage name of Jonathan Visger, opened with the songs “Herizen,” “Trouble” and “Endless Summer.” He also played his most popular song “Dissolve” which has over 6 million streams on Spotify. The crowd approved of and encouraged Absofacto with earnest applause, and eagerly awaited the headliner to take the stage. 
Two Feet delivered an out-of-character performance that saw him bursting with energy. Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
At 9:30 p.m., Two Feet began his set. Normally, Two Feet concerts consist of Dess wearing a black t-shirt, black pants and playing a black guitar; he’s known for standing center stage, performing casually and emitting relaxed, mellow vibes. This night, however, Two Feet transformed his image. Dess veered from his usual black street wear to studded jeans and snakeskin shoes, traded in his black guitar for a red and white one and even crowd surfed. This conduct was out of character for Two Feet, but the crowd responded excitedly to his new rockstar persona. 
Throughout the concert, Two Feet mixed his most famous songs with new covers he wanted to test out on the crowd. Dess performed “Quick Musical Doodles and Sex,” “I Feel Like I’m Drowning” and his most popular hit, “Go F-ck Yourself,” which received an encore thanks to its incredible live rendition. After playing “Go F-ck Yourself” Dess looked at producer Geoffrey Hufford, who was on drum pad, asked him to play the song again and then proceeded to leap into the crowd. Audience members jumped to be closer to Dess and the venue lit up with phone cameras, as no one in the crowd wanted to miss the marquee moment. 
Two Feet drew the crowd in with his rockstar attitude, guitar tricks and copacetic stage presence. When he wasn’t crowd surfing, playing guitar on the floor or sipping whiskey, Two Feet stood center-stage as always, playing his guitar and whispering into the microphone. The audience was surprised by Two Feet’s unexpected energy, so the air was calm for the majority of the concert when he wasn’t performing his outrageous antics. 
Dramatic, raspy and dark, Two Feet’s music is eerily relatable for millennials today. Fittingly, most concertgoers were young adults or teenagers, though a number of older couples attended. Still, with such a dynamic performance, Dess managed to put on a show that everyone was able to enjoy.

Although freshmen, spring admits and transfer students may have just settled into their residential colleges and apartments, the looming prospect of finding housing for the 2018-19 academic year is fast approaching. But there is no need to fear: USC has housing options to suit all different sets of student living needs, price ranges and special interests.
USC Village
USC Village is a popular choice for undergraduates, with its new facilities and a variety of amenities. Photo courtesy of USC News.
The housing complex has approximately 2,000 spots open for returning students. From lofts with kitchenettes to full-sized apartments with living rooms, USC Village has something for everyone. A space in the complex can range from $3,250 per semester to rent a two-bedroom, four-person loft to $6,590 for a single in a two-bedroom apartment. All contracts include a partial meal plan, which can be used at dining halls.
Building 6, located in the southwest corner, is home to Cale and Irani Residential Colleges, open to all upperclassmen. Cale Residential College offers programming for students who are interested in learning about global issues and international relations. Irani offers workshops and activities in performance science for students who want to improve their leadership skills. Cale and Irani is also a great choice for students who like to frequent the gym as the USC Village Fitness Center is right under the residential apartments.
Priam Residential College, a special community for innovation and design students, is just across from the main campus. A second-floor patio overlooks the main plaza, and Wahlburgers, the newest hot spot at USC Village, is located on the first floor of Building 7. Trejo’s Tacos and Solé Bicycles are also in the building.
A little over 350 spots are available for sophomores, juniors and seniors in Building 8. Bohnett Residential College programming focuses on social entrepreneurship and seeking solutions to improve socioeconomic conditions in communities, while Nemirovsky Residential College for Sustainability encourages eco-friendly living. Amenities include Starbucks and CAVA on the first floor of the building, and an outdoor lounge on the second floor.
Cowlings and Ilium offer the widest selection of room types. As the largest structure in USC Village, it provides housing to 700 students. Located right above Target Express, Trader Joe’s, Core Power Yoga and the Department of Public Safety office, the competition for a spot in Building 9 will be fierce. Cowlings Residential College for Arts and Cultures will provide opportunities to explore Los Angeles. The new Ilium Sophomore Honors Residential College connects symbolically with a bridge to the freshman McCarthy Honors Residential College. Only 350 spots are available in Ilium, and hopeful residents must complete an application process consisting of five essays.
Main USC Campus
Other living options include Parkside Apartments and Webb Tower.
Located on W. 9th St. right across from Parkside Dining Hall, the six-story Parkside Apartments is home to the Shalom and Muslim special interest communities. Both studio and apartment floor plans are available.
Webb Tower, on W. 34th St., provides 14 floors of undergraduate housing. With only eight apartments per floor, inhabitants will get to know their neighbors very quickly. Although West Residential College doesn’t have its own dining hall, USC’s newest Starbucks is located right under King Hall, and the USC Village Dining Hall is only a short walk away. Not to mention, it’s the closest housing complex to the Lyon Recreation Center and Uytengsu Aquatic Center.
Off-campus Apartments
Annenberg House, Cardinal ‘N Gold, Cardinal Gardens, Century and La Sorbonne are some of the many apartment options for those who want to live a little farther from campus. Some apartments require meal plans, so check with each residential college to confirm. For the apartments closer to campus, a partial meal plan might be convenient.
Annenberg House offers limited space for students in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, as well as their roommates. Cardinal `N Gold has a sustainable living special interest community, and encourages composting, recycling and using eco-friendly appliances. Cardinal Gardens is located on McClintock Avenue, right across from the Village and close to the West Residential College facilities. The central courtyard includes barbecue grills, a fireplace and a basketball half-court. A recreational room in the CSC lobby is perfect for late-night pool games.
Century Apartments is another good option for workout junkies. Just across Jefferson Boulevard, it is close to the Lyon Center and USC Village Fitness Center. It is also home to the gender-inclusive Rainbow Floor for LGBTQ and ally students. Also off Jefferson is La Sorbonne, a small, quiet apartment complex with full kitchens, studio apartments and newly remodeled bathrooms.

Audience members were then invited to participate in an interactive flash mob in the ballroom of Tutor Campus Center. Sasha Reiss | Daily Trojan
On Tuesday night in Doheny Memorial Library, Visions and Voices hosted a conversation with female artists of color in conjunction with Arts Leadership at USC, the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs and the International Association of Blacks in Dance. 
The discussion was moderated by Charmaine Jefferson, former director of the California African American Museum, and included 22 panelists who boasted diverse backgrounds ranging from dance and theatre to music and arts administration. 
At the panel, chairs were organized in a circle in the center of the room, rather than linearly. Jefferson said the purpose of the unorthodox arrangement was to give the event the lively, colloquial atmosphere of a “dinner party” rather than the “stuffiness” of a formal, academic setting. 
And, indeed, watching the discussion unfold was like witnessing the reunion of a group of old friends. The outpouring of empathy and support in the room was palpable as the five founders of the IABD spoke about their struggles to be accepted within the dance community as black dancers: the lack of funding and opportunities; the erasure of iconic and pioneering figures in dance history; and the importance of preserving their legacy for the next generation of artists and the bittersweet nature of handing over the reins. 
“I knew that nobody saw me as a dancer,” said Cleo Parker Robinson, the Vice Chair of the IABD Board of Directors. “I went to studios and they all thought I looked different from them but when I looked at myself, I thought, ‘Well I don’t look so different from anybody else.’ But when I went into a class, it didn’t feel right. So I wanted to create an environment where anybody who walks into that door knows they belong.” 
Current members of the IABD, such as Marjani Forte-Saunders, an experimental dancer and artist, were also given the chance to express their appreciation for the founders, speak on their own experiences forging new ground and point out areas where there is still work to be done. 
“I think all the work that is happening in my body still looks like the work you all have done in terms of connecting with my community and working in partnership with the people around me to fulfill my vision,” Forte-Saunders said. “As a radical experimenter in the arts, I am still very much a part of the lineage of black dance and black ingenuity and black experimentation.”
Jefferson also made sure to spotlight the other speakers, including Reena Esmail, composer-in-residence at Street Symphony, a nonprofit organization that hosts outreach concerts for underserved members of the community. Esmail discussed the cognitive dissonance present in being the only artist of color selected to perform, knowing that her mere presence onstage meant that the opportunity would be denied someone else. 
“When we’re in that situation, we know that we have to be the representative of our entire race and gender, otherwise no other brown woman will ever get on that stage,” Esmail said. “At the same time, paradoxically, we also know that by our being on that stage, it prevents any other brown woman from being there because we are the quota for the year.”
The event concluded with a participatory dance flash mob facilitated by the Viver Brasil Dance Company. The dancers led a conga line that weaved its way through campus, from Doheny to the Tutor Campus Center ballroom. There, participants skipped and swayed along to the thumping, high-energy Afro-Brazilian music, proving that dance is a universal means of expression.

Last weekend, I got a text from a close friend in response to a blog post I had published. He was concerned for my well-being. 
Most of my blog ramblings are filled with biting analogies and vague allusions to the perils of heartbreak. This one was no exception. I had to convince him that no, I did not need an intervention. And that yes, I was fine. 
This wasn’t the first time. In fact, my friend has voiced his concern about my mental health multiple times. He thinks I manufacture artificial dilemmas and take on other people’s problems for the sole purpose of having content to write about. At the end of our virtual exchange, he offhandedly asked, “Why do you always have to feel something? Have you tried writing about happy things for once?” 
Sadness and anger have helped me cultivate some of my best work. Writing helps me sort through life’s turbulence. But creative freedom and deadlines create a conflicting dilemma that frequently throws me off balance. 
Without a definite prompt, I’ll probably be floundering in writer’s block because most of my stimuli comes from the rollercoaster of emotions I feel in the moment.
Heck, maybe I don’t know what I’m getting myself into by being a columnist for the Daiy Trojan. I can’t sit around all day waiting for a wave of thought-provoking anguish to strike me before I can whip out my laptop and type up a storm. Interesting happenings that pique my interest, random snippets of telling conversation and, most of the time, conflict, are the main catalysts for me to begin writing open-ended pieces, but sometimes none of these things come to me by the time I submit my final draft to my editor.

Nevertheless, feelings are fickle. I’m a journalism major for crying out loud! News is rarely presented in a way with room for emotionally-charged melodramas, much less mine (and I acknowledge that it shouldn’t — after all, we chase objectivity). I can neatly put aside my feelings temporarily in order to complete those assignments, but as soon as that’s done, those emotions will most definitely resurface.
And no, just to clarify, I’m not some bitter individual trying to stir up trouble so the next boy that wrongs me can be the main character in a fresh takedown piece. This also isn’t a cop out. I’m not trying to make excuses and throw my hands in the air, backing away from all responsibility as a writer by saying that I need to experience emotions in order to start. I’m only 19 years old, and I feel that sooner or later I won’t be able to turn to the archives of brooding introspection or fish around for an emotional reflex every time I’m required to compose something new. It’s impractical, and although it’s produced some of the pieces of which I’m most proud, I wonder how long I can sustain this and how sane it’ll keep me.
This year, I’ve finally come around and begrudgingly acknowledged that I am someone who often wears her heart on her sleeve. I’m just eager to share that perspective through the things I discuss, and that’s not such a terrible thing, nor am I ashamed of it. As I mentioned, I’m only 19; I still have plenty of time to experience more of life. 
While it might take a while for me to reconcile with my inner turmoil and, in the meantime, find other things to talk about creatively in order to meet those unforgiving due dates, all I can do is slowly switch gears and find motivation in the little things. 
I should probably stop waiting around for “stuff” to happen but instead be open to creating inspiration independent of my feelings. Maybe sometimes, I have to accept that I just have to write to meet a deadline.

Rossier professor of higher education William Tierney and Rossier Ph.D. candidate James Ward published a policy proposal in the Educational Researcher last December demonstrating that LGBTQ homeless youth need more acknowledgement by policymakers. 
A policy proposal published by Rossier professor of higher education William Tierney and Rossier Ph.D. candidate James Ward suggests that lawmakers must practice LGBTQ-inclusive policymaking. Daily Trojan file photo.
“We opted to focus on LGBTQ homeless youth because there’s a dearth of research and policy compared to homelessness in general,” Tierney told USC News. 
In the past year, the Los Angeles Homeless Count found that 35 percent of homeless youth identify as LGBTQ, according to the report. 
While the 2017 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress found that Los Angeles County hosts the second largest homeless population in the nation, the researchers say the critical issue lies in the way policymakers neglect framing the discussion around specific communities like the youth LGBTQ community. 
“Sometimes when we think of  ‘homelessness’ or even ‘homeless youth’ we tend to lump people as if there is a one-size-fits-all problem and solution,” Tierney said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “But that’s not the case. LGBTQ homeless youth frequently face very different problems than other kids. They are more likely to have been kicked out and less likely to have support structures.” 
LGBTQ youth have a unique set of obstacles that are too often brushed under the rug, Ward said.
“These students are more likely to be unaccompanied and thus may not have family to advocate for their needs,” Ward said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “It’s important that policies reflect this and services are easily accessible to unaccompanied students. Moreover, the experiences of LGBTQ homeless youth include higher rates of drug and alcohol abuse and sexual exploitation. Policies must reflect these differences and provide support for all aspects of these students’ lives, not just their homeless status.”
The paper focused on three main policy areas: outreach, sensitivity training and inclusive policymaking.
Because LGBTQ youth face higher levels of discrimination than their heterosexual counterparts in homeless shelters and other services, the paper concluded that there must be widescale LGBTQ sensitivity training to address discrimination issues LGBTQ youth face.
On the streets, LGBTQ youth are forced to have “survival sex” for food and other necessities, and are overall more susceptible to being assaulted than homeless heterosexual youth are, according to the Journal of Youth and Adolescence.
Furthermore, most homeless shelters are gender specific, and oftentimes exclude members of the transgender community. According to a 2011 study by the National Center for Transgender Equality, 29 percent of transgender people that needed emergency shelters were denied access because of their genders. 
The most important concept that Tierney and Ward are pushing is inclusivity in policymaking. 
“LGBTQ youth face great risk of experiencing homelessness as well as other injustices, as we know,” Suzanne Wenzel, a professor at the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We must address homelessness among LGBTQ and other youth so that they may enjoy opportunities to live rich and productive lives.” 
Along with the paper, Tierney and Ward plan to launch projects to conduct more research in Los Angeles on the specific issue of LGBTQ youth, according to USC News. 
“We have the leeway to put forward a project that is not simply aimed at the investigation of a discrete topic, but one that can dramatically improve the lives of those who are among the most at-risk in our society and in Los Angeles,” Tierney wrote.
Although the paper illustrates the extensive discrimination faced by LGBTQ homeless youth, Tierney has a positive outlook for finding solutions to the issue.
“This can be a very depressing portrait that makes these youth look broken and in need of repair,” Tierney wrote. “I understand why individuals think that, but we also need to recognize the courage and resilience these students face and figure out ways to empower them, rather than think that we have all the answers.”
Housing LGBTQ youth is an important piece of working to improve mental health and prevent substance use in this community whose needs are often overlooked or outright denied (“29 percent of transgender people that needed emergency shelters were denied access because of their genders). It is unacceptable to neglect our youth and create an environment in which they engage in unhealthy behaviors due to lack of access to services. We can, and will, do better!
Even when they’re NOT homeless they need more attention.

A consortium recently formed by the USC Marshall School of Business and USC Viterbi School of Engineering is in the works of transforming the city of Los Angeles to generate an Internet of Things system that allows companies and residents to generate community-managed data marketplaces.

This Intelligent Internet of Things Integrator consortium includes Verizon, Traction Labs, the city of Los Angeles and various other tech companies.
“This particular collaboration … started out as days of discussion with colleagues and Viterbi and Marshall trying to understand why smart cities aren’t happening as quickly as we might imagine,” said USC Viterbi professor Bhaskar Krishnamachari, one of the co-founders of I3. “We’ve been hearing about smart cities for some time and IoT technologies are starting to mature … with some of the platforms companies have.”
To expand these smart cities, community-based IoT networks constructed by the I3 consortium will be generating “powerful data ‘rivers,’” which condense data from IoT device owners into one common stream, the press release stated. 
According to Krishnamachari, building these networks entailed collaboration among people from engineering fields, market design and government agencies.
“The way cities are going to become smart is not from one single vendor figuring out how to develop a smart city solution and selling that to a particular city,” Krishnamachari said. “It’s going to happen when there’s a whole ecosystem of business partners, government agencies and academics working together … and having their products and services interconnect with each other very easily.” 
According to the press release, these IoT networks have several applications, including improvements in decision-making and customer service. I3 also has plans to create an environment for application developers, device manufacturers and data service providers to test apps that have the possibility of improving the quality of life for residents. 
USC Marshall assistant professor Jerry Power said that in the next several months the consortium plans to maximize participation in the contribution to the development of smart cities, as well as test more IoT projects on the University campus. 
“What we’re doing is very unique and different in the way we are approaching and thinking of IoT,” Power said. “In some ways, we think about what we’re looking at IoT is sort of a future way of maybe trying to condition the way data is connected in a community and the way they use it.”

The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity presented researchers from the USC Viterbi School of Engineering’s Information Sciences Institute with a $16.7 million grant to develop a tool that will more efficiently translate low-resource languages. The project, titled SARAL, which stands for Summarization and domain-Adaptive Retrieval, will focus on creating systems that will provide automated translations and summaries of those languages.

Leading the team are principal investigator and ISI research team leader Scott Miller, ISI computer scientists Jonathan May, ISI research lead Elizabeth Boschee and senior advisors Prem Natarajan and Kevin Knight. The research team includes about 30 researchers well-versed in machine translation, speech recognition, morphology, information retrieval, representation and summarization.
The purpose of the systems is to retrieve foreign language documents and provide summaries about how they are relevant to proposed questions.
“The overall objective is to provide a Google-like capability, except the queries are in English, but the retrieved documents are in a low-resource foreign language,” Miller said to USC News.
The summaries will be 100-word responses to domain-specific questions.
“You can think of the summary as something like Cliffs Notes, but with the added feature that it is indexed to the precise part you want to write your essay about,” May said to USC News.
The systems being developed are different from current systems because the ones currently in use depend largely on wide ranges of written samples to become acquainted with the languages. Though they are spoken by millions, low-resource languages do not have a large number of documents. The systems will first be tested using Tagalog and Swahili, both obscure languages selected by the IARPA. As the project develops, more languages will be added to the translating systems.
“Since we don’t have a lot of written data in these languages, we have to do more with less,” May said to USC News. “Ideally, we would use about 300 million words to train a machine-translation system — and in this case, we have around 800,000 words. There are about 100,000 words per novel, so we have only eight novels’ worth of words to work from.”
Those working on the project will begin by gathering a variety of documents that have been translated to English in the past. Documents will include speech, online documents and video clips. 
Afterward, they will create algorithms to analyze different language patterns such as sentence structure and morphology, the study of word formation.
Other universities are also working toward creating translation systems. IARPA’s project MATERIAL —  Machine Translation for English Retrieval of Information in Any Language — is currently being developed by John Hopkins University, Columbia University and Raytheon BBN Technologies.
