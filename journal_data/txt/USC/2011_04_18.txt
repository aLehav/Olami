The dreaded college application process has caused sleepless nights for many high school students, but students looking to apply to USC in the future might be able to breathe a little easier.
USC will be joining the Common Application’s 2011-12 admission cycle, along with 48 other institutions.
USC’s Office of Admission, lead by Dean of Admission Timothy Brunold, has been working with the Common Application for many years to switch from the in-house online application to the Common Application.
“[The USC admission staff] wanted to be more responsive to the people we work with,” Brunold said. “High school guidance counselors and students would ask why we didn’t accept the Common App and when we were going to.”
Changing the application procedure is expected to increase efficiency and make it easier on students and guidance counselors, according to Kirk Brennan, USC’s director of Admission.
“The Common App will save [guidance counselors and prospective students] from many steps and from repeating themselves [in applications],” Brunold said.
In applying to multiple institutions, high school guidance counselors and teachers will only have to submit letters of recommendation, transcripts and evaluations once through Common Application’s online portal.
Brunold said there will be a USC supplement to the Common Application.
“The form is a starting point and we are in the process of creating the supplement … it will be very similar to what we are already asking students,” Brunold said.
Current USC students agree the switch will bring increased efficiency to the application process.
“I wish the Common App was available when I applied because it always felt like I was filling out the same form twice,” said Kathleen Colao, a freshman majoring in heath promotion and disease prevention. “It will be beneficial for applicants and relieve some stress in applying to college.”
USC has been fine-tuning its own online application for close to 20 years, and the new Common Application form will take significant work to perfect, according to Brennan.
“If you look at the top 20 universities according to US News [& World Report,] all of them, except MIT, participate in the Common App. It has become a growing trend over the years,” said Gene Bickers, vice provost for undergraduate programs.
In switching to the Common App, USC’s admissions office hopes to increase the number and diversity of students from different geographical locations, ethnicities and economic backgrounds, according to Brennan.
“By joining our not-for-profit association of colleges, USC will have access to 700,000 college applicants next year, one-third of whom are students of color, one-fourth of whom are first generation college students and one-tenth of whom are international students,” said Rob Killion, executive director for Common Application, Inc.
Some USC students said they think the transition to the Common Application will enhance the students USC can attract.
“Converting to the Common App is a good thing,” said Meredith Reed, a sophomore majoring in philosophy. “The new application will make it easier for more students to apply, which will result in a greater student body diversity.”
The Office of Admissions is confident in its decision to switch to the Common Application, according to Brunold.
“[The switch] was not an easy decision,”Brennan said. “If we [USC admissions] don’t do it carefully we will lose the personalized feel of our application.”
Applicants will be able to access the Common Application beginning August 1.
Prospective graduate students will continue to use USC’s online application portal.
I think there is nothing wrong with USC trying to expand their applicant pool and lowering their admissions rate. Obviously, that is not the primary and sole goal of the switch. But, it will inevitably increase USC’s lay prestige and ranking in the famous US News Best College Rankings. Every university does it — especially the ones in the Top 25. Fight on!
Disappointing. I actually really enjoyed USC’s application. It was comparatively fun and differed positively from the common app, UC apps, etc.
Filling out a college application, once the essay is written, is not that hard. It takes a few minutes to fill in your name, big deal if you have to do that more than once. Want to know the REAL reason USC is moving to the Common Application? Boosting application numbers. Now, thousands of high school students who have no real interest in USC will apply because they filled out the Common App and will just send it everywhere it’s accepted. USC will still accept the same number, but from a much larger pool. Then, USC will go from a 20% to 15% acceptance rate (or whatever), boosting US News rankings, which universities, students, and parents are all secretly obsessed with. It really is just a sort of backhanded marketing move.
Bryan,
I’m sure your point part of it, but it’s a decidedly cynical view to take. If you can remember back a few years, you’d know that filling out multiple applications was more than simply filling in a name. USC’s current app included several parts: all of your personal information, electronically-submitted grades for each high school class, a separate and specific essay and short answer questions, and often manually-submitted supplements for a specific major.
The acceptance rate is just part of it. There’s nothing bad about streamlining a process that can take several hours for busy high school seniors.
While it will lower the acceptance rate, I think it will also lower the yield rate. If more students are applying to USC “just because,” then they’re less likely to enroll if accepted. USC needs to work on its yield rate before it tries to break into the sub-20% acceptance rates. There are other universities with sub-20% acceptance rates but they also have very low yield rates, so they’re perceived to be a “notch below.” Yield is really the root of perceptions of quality… but USC sees what Columbia did (switching to the Common App, getting 30%+ more applications, and having an acceptance rate lower than any school except Harvard) and wants to do the same.
So “yield rate” just means “safety net” right?..I was at the gym several months ago, and I overheard some high school guys’ conversation regarding which universities they applied to. These guys all seemed bright, articulate in speech, and competitive. One guy’s answer to which schools he applied to went like, “Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Stanford and USC…” No public schools were mentioned. And yes, USC was the last on his list. It doesn’t bother me that USC is still perceived as “safety school” among elite private schools. Honestly, after college (undergraduate) most people nor employers don’t care where you got your degree…it’s not that big of a deal.
Fantastic news!

President C. L. Max Nikias will be giving his first President’s Award for Staff Achievement to Larry Lim, the director of pre-college programs at USC Viterbi School of Engineering.
Recognized · Larry Lim, the director of pre-college programs at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, has worked with the MESA program since he was a high school teacher. - John McGillen | Daily Trojan 
Nikias will present the annual award to Lim at the Staff Recognition Luncheon on May 4. The award is given to the full-time employee who “displays outstanding contributions to the enhancement of USC,” according to the President’s Award for Staff Achievement website.
Lim, who began his career as a high school teacher, has been with the Viterbi School of Engineering since 1979. Some of his most significant work has been with the Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement program.
MESA is a USC program that helps to serve disadvantaged youths at the pre-college and college levels by exposing them to the fields of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, aerospace and robotics.
“This award is great because it recognizes the work that the office does and the importance of pre-college programs and working with children to improve their education,” Lim said.
Lim has been involved with MESA since he was a high school teacher.
“Personally, my staff and myself have been impressed with the incredible impact he has had on so many youths,” said Diane Schrader, Manager of Policy Development and Communication for Administrative Operations. “There are students who have felt that Mr. Lim’s program has literally changed their lives.”
In one local school where Lim introduced robotics, 100 percent of the students involved in the program went on to attend college. Ninety percent chose to major in science, math or engineering.
Lim also supports and co-sponsors the Los Angeles area FIRST Robotics competition, mentors Rossier graduate students interested in K-12 education and donates his time to community events like science fairs. He has also implemented a Statewide Webpage Design competition for middle school students supported by Microsoft and started several summer school programs for high school students.
Yannis Yortsos, dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering, described Lim as a quiet, considerate and loyal person who helps everyone he can.
“A number of faculty members interact with him. For many writing research proposals, one of the requirements is having an outreach plan, with which Larry has helped many people,” Yortsos said.
Lim remains humble about his work and awards.
“My greatest accomplishments were simply getting more kids interested in going to college,” Lim said.
Schrader said there were about 50 nominees for this year’s award.
“With the vast number of employees USC has, selecting one as the most example staff, is by definition a highly competitive process,” Schrader said. “This year was no exception.”
The process of nomination and selection for the award is not a simple task, according to Schrader.
“It’s an arduous task of narrowing down the pool to a smaller group from which the president usually makes his selection, but the president does have access to all the information,” Schrader said.
Staff members are often nominated for the award by their peers, but people not connected to the university can also nominate staff members.
Wow, this reads like a high school newspaper article. Way to represent USC, once-great Daily Trojan.
Who is Schrader? The article was edited without the first reference to Schrader.

Messages written in chalk on University Avenue sparked controversy and led some students to respond Monday.
On Sunday, members of USC’s chapter of the Zeitgeist Movement, an international social movement that advocates applying scientific solutions to social concerns, scrawled messages on the sidewalk that highlighted what they see as contradictions in the Bible.
Examination · The sidewalk between Troy Apartments and the Hebrew Union College became a canvas for students to express their religious beliefs in response to messages left by members of The Zeitgeist Movement. - Jennifer Schultz | Daily Trojan 
The messages included passages from the New and Old Testaments and questioned why an omnipotent God would ask people to believe in such things as slavery or beating children.
Though most students who walked over the chalk seemed to ignore it, some Christian students responded ­— in chalk.
“For God loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but give him eternal life,” one counterpoint read. “For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through life.”
The USC chapter of TZM began this semester and has about 10 active members, according to co-founder Sean Hernandez, a sophomore double majoring in economics and environmental studies. Hernandez said the group wanted to clear up what it sees as misconceptions about the Bible and to spark discussion.
“People think they get morality from the Bible, and people don’t realize what is actually written in the Old and New Testament,” Hernandez said.
But some students were offended by TZM’s message
Ryan Cleary, a freshman majoring in computer science engineering, said he felt the anti-Bible messages took passages out of their literary and cultural contexts.
“Without fully understanding the Bible or its intricacies you can’t really understand its message,” Cleary said. “There is a misrepresentation of the context of the Bible with those verses.”
Nick Bradvica, another co-founder of the USC TZM chapter, said he and other group members spoke frankly about religion with several students when writing the chalk messages Sunday.
“We really want to start a discussion,” Bradvica said. “We’re hoping to organize some debates next semester because people are busy with finals now, so that people will really consider these issues.”
Members of TZM believe science trumps religion, and Hernandez said religion “offers a closed world view.”
But Reid Roman, a sophomore majoring in industrial systems engineering and communication and a Christian, said he felt the messages were close-minded and written just to “stir the pot.”
“It was frustrating that my religion was misrepresented,” Roman said. “It made me feel sad for the people who were writing that because they were so misguided.”
Ethan Blair, USC Hillel’s Rabbinic Intern, whose office is on the block next to the chalk messages, said the messages reflect  the time at which the Bible was written, and he hoped it would spark student discussion among students.
“There’s something safe about the anonymity of being able to write something on the sidewalk and then walk away,” Blair said. “These are difficult conversations to have face-to-face, so I can see the value in this conversation being something that people notice even if it’s not an organized debate.”
Damn it, Zeitgeisters!!  I’m proud of you for actually getting our name out there, but seriously?  We shouldn’t be attacking religion the way you guys did…it doesn’t cause discussion, it just freaks the Jesus lovers out.  There are better ways to get our name out there and progress our goals than atheist graffiti.  Proud of you for being organized though!  Keep it up!
Lots of unsupported statements, from all sides, in this thread.
If you’re not willing to express the grounds of your opinion,
it’s very arrogant to post it as fact.
If they really wanted to ‘spark discussion’ they would have drawn images of the prophet Muhammad.
I would love to see if the Daily Trojan would have been brave enough to post pictures of that.
Science adjusts its views on what is observed. Faith is the denial of observation so that belief can be preserved.
As a former Christian turned agnostic, I absolutely agree with the humanist approach to life. Yup, the only meaning to “life” is that it’s going to end…for every single one of us. To think that you deserve some sort of existence after your physical life ends is unreasonable; and if God existed, God is reasonable. The Bible is nothing more than recapitulated platitudes dressed up to seem esoteric and profound, but it’s nonetheless banal and simplistic as every other religion or philosophy that existed before Judeo-Christianity and everything that will come after. 
We’re all gonna die and that’s it; nothing more…just accept it.
This is the worst headline I have ever seen. Please tell me more important things the one day I scan this paper to see if there’s anything I should read.
Because with headlines like this, the answer is no.
As former advisor to a student atheist group, I was on a panel at Bovard put on by the Harvard Veritas forum where it was asked if there was a blueprint for life and did it have a purpose. Our “blueprint” is in our DNA and our “purpose” is expressed by what we do next by design or by choice. Asking “why” we act and/or choose what we do is the extra credit part. The meaning of “life” is that it ends. You determine your actions within the limits of your being. Some people are convinced that revealed knowledge from a supernatural being provides a timeless message and a roadmap to be followed; often including rewards and sanctions. Others (such as myself) feel that using humanist ethics in finding your own course is preferable to using the competing and clearly at times, contradictory messages from this supposed god as making more sense as the default position.
In my presentation, I stated that if this God’s intention was for humans to know of its existence and its instructions for humanity, then it has failed miserably. Technical writers sometimes say that if the manual is not understood, it is the writer’s fault not the reader’s. Clearly, any god worth its salt falls under the same standard.
I also opened by thanking the forum for the inclusion of those of the non-existent godview as in another time, or place..even now in some parts of our planet; just expressing my views along these lines could have resulted in my execution, torture, imprisonment, loss of rights, employment, community membership, freedom, choice of partner, and more.
This is the “context” that comes to mind when believers worry about others giving their belief/God/sacred texts proper deference. When I’m asked who am I to argue with God, I say when I hear from their God I’ll let them know.
“Theologian: An uncommon individual who, though possessing finite abilities, has been called by God himself who, though possessing infinite abilities, requires the assistance of the former in explaining Himself to the rest of us.”
[Translation: if God existed, theologians would be out of work.] ~ “Rev” Donald Morgan
There is a god.
fail.
The chalked messages are an attacked disguised as a discussion promoter. If indeed healthy discussion was the purpose behind the chalking, the focus would have been on questions as such: Who is God? Does He exist? Why do bad things happen to ‘good’ people? Where is God in all of this?, etc. This was not the case. The chalking is a straight-up attack on not only Jesus and Christianity, but on any belief in God, religion or deity itself. Statements such as “The Bible is B.S.” are not discussion-provokers, they are statements of hateful intent. 
I applaud those who have responded to this in concern for those who have made such unwarranted, out-of-context generalizations. And I will speak out as well. But God doesn’t need us to defend Him–creation declares His majesty. In Luke 19: 40, Jesus responds to a request that His worshippers be silenced: “I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.” 
God is real, very real. He knows the heart and intent of every single person that ever lived. So you better believe He cares about this. The only legitimate response to doubts or disbelief in God is to investigate it, thoroughly. Do you believe your history books? The Bible is the most historically backed up book in existence. Not one geographical finding has contradicted Biblical statements. Just a tidbit for you skepticals. We’re all intelligent people; we’re here because we put time and effort into our work. So you got doubts? Do your homework.
“Not one geographical finding has contradicted Biblical statements”.
I can’t even begin to explain how retarded this statement is.
> I can’t even begin to explain how *retarded* this statement is.
It’s unfortunate that seemingly educated people continue to use that word.
Wait, you have nothing to back up what you just said. Everything is just your opinion.
The whole point of zeitgeist is to open the minds of the human species to reality. All institutions, such as government, churches, schools, prevent it’s followers from learning real new information. And when you say “the bible is the most historical backed up book in existence” shows how close minded you are. If u knew anything about the bible then you would know that every story in it was never reported by any historical writer during it’s time span. Especially things such as the great flood, Moses, and Jesus and many others. None of those events were written by historic scholars. Even our modern history books don’t say the complete truth, everyone knows that. TZM’s mane goal is to cause awareness to what we need to survive and how technology can make us achieve anything.
Anyone would feel attacked if there whole identity or reason for living is proven to be just a story that derives from 30000 years ago by people looking at the positions of the stars.
But I’m sorry it’s time to bring the human life up to scale with technology because this planet is our home and we all inhabit it
Haha go Jews for supporting healthy discussion! This article rocks and I love Sean Hernandez and Nick Bradvica and all of TZM
There is no god.

Pac-12 hires Steeg for title game
A longtime NFL executive is bringing his pro talent to the collegiate level next year — specifically, the soon-to-be Pac-12 conference.
Pac-12 officials announced today Jim Steeg, who has managed all special events for the NFL, including pro bowls and drafts, and is credited with turning the Super Bowl into one of the world’s top sporting events, will serve as the director of the Pac-12 championship game.
“With more than 30 years at the NFL, Jim Steeg is the pre-eminent expert in building and managing big football championship events,” said Pac-10 Commissioner Larry Scott in a statement released by the Pac-10. “Our focus is to create the most exciting and entertaining championship environment in college football and having Jim’s innovative approach and expertise will undoubtedly enhance those efforts.”
The Pac-10 will officially become the Pac-12 on July 1, when Utah and Colorado join the conference. The Pac-12 will host its first title game at the home stadium of the team with the best overall conference record in a matchup tentatively scheduled for Dec. 3.
“I am excited to have the opportunity to fulfill the vision that Larry Scott has developed for this game and for the conference,” Steeg said in the statement. “The unique concept of playing the championship game at a host school will provide a chance to work with all 12 conference members and put their stamp on the event.”
In Steeg’s 35 years with the NFL, 26 have been leading the organization of special events — most notably, the Super Bowl, which Steeg grew from a single game to a week-long event complete with charity efforts and The NFL Experience. He also was the COO of the San Diego Chargers between 2004 and 2010.

Thompson declares for the draft
Washington State guard Klay Thompson will declare for the NBA draft but will not hire an agent, his father and former NBA star Mychal Thompson told ESPN.com on Monday.
Last season, Thompson led the Pac-10 in scoring with 21.6 points per game in addition to 5.2 rebounds per game.
“He wants to get a couple of workouts to see where he fits,” Mychal Thompson, the radio color commentator for the NBA’s Los Angeles Lakers, told Diamond Leung of ESPN.com on Monday. “All the scouts love him. They love his complete game. I’m getting very favorable feedback.”
It has been speculated that the 6-foot-6 swingman would return to school, provided he was not guaranteed to be selected in the first round of the draft.
“It was a very difficult decision,” the elder Thompson said. “He’s very sentimental about college, and it’s not 100 percent he’s leaving.”
Thompson’s departure could mean eight of the top 15 scorers in the Pac-10 last season are gone, including the top four.
In the last month, Arizona’s Derrick Williams, USC’s Nikola Vucevic and Washington’s Isaiah Thomas  have announced their intentions to turn pro. The three were ranked No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4 respectively in scoring this season.
UCLA underclassmen, forward Tyler Honeycutt and guard Malcolm Lee, also declared for the draft despite the threat of an NBA lockout.

Report released regarding death of Notre Dame student
After spending nearly six months investigating the death of a student videographer, the University of Notre Dame released a report yesterday stating it believes outdated weather information was to blame.
Declan Sullivan, 20, died Oct. 27 when the 40-foot hydraulic lift he was standing on collapsed while he was filming football practice. Wind gusts at the time of the accident reached 53 mph.
Members of the coaching staff who make decisions regarding whether or not it’s safe for the team to practice outside likely used weather readings reported several hours before practice started, the investigation found. Specifically, at 1:54 p.m., the National Weather Service was reporting winds of 23 mph with gusts up to 29 mph.
The readings were useless when practice started at 3:45 p.m. At 2:54 p.m., winds were measured at 29 mph, with gusts at 38 mph. The staff was apparently unaware of this information. At the time of the accident, 4:54 p.m., when the weather service reported gusts of up to 51 mph.
“The report highlights that as the primary weakness in our procedures,” said John Affleck Graves, Notre Dame’s executive vice president, in reference to the outdated information. “The lack of wind-measuring equipment on the field during the practice and the absence of any single individual with responsibility for monitoring the wind.”
The Rev. John Jenkins, Notre Dame’s president, said he is to blame for the tragic accident, and said nobody has been punished.
“We did not find any individual who disregarded safety or was indifferent to safety,” Jenkins said. “Our conclusion is that it’s a collective responsibility that must be deal[t] with collectively as we move forward.”
About a month ago, the Indiana Occupational Health and Safety Administration hit the university with a $77,500 fine for six safety violations related to Sullivan’s death.

Backup quarterbacks live by this mantra: It’s just a play away.
Just as the vice president is a heartbeat away from the presidency, the No. 2 signal-callers are one snap away from going from relative obscurity to having all eyes looking at them.
There are those who never get the chance, those that history relegates to the sidelines indefinitely. Then there are the Tom Bradys and Matt Cassels, those who prepared every game as if they were starting, so when the day came, they would be ready. And they were.
There might not be a more important backup position in sports. The second-string quarterback is like an understudy who must be able to jump into the performance at any moment and not forget any of his lines. He is an insurance policy, a reliever and the most popular guy on the team — until he makes his first mistake.
With junior quarterback Matt Barkley firmly in control of the starting job at USC, the battle over who is going to back him up has been one of the biggest story lines of the spring. With spring practices set to finish at the end of the week, it appears redshirt freshman Jesse Scroggins will eventually hold the No. 2 spot.
USC was spoiled in recent years by often having talented quarterback waiting on the sidelines: Cassel, John David Booty, Mark Sanchez, even Mitch Mustain. Though not always a guarantee of success, having that experience coming off the bench is certainly a luxury.
Scroggins, who turned 19 last month, will not have that. He’s green. He has never taken a snap in college. The two freshmen behind him, Cody Kessler and Max Wittek, are even greener.
Scroggins has continued to impress coaches, but he still has a long way to go. He completed four of five passes in Saturday’s scrimmage but threw one interception.
Those mistakes will happen as he continues to learn the playbook and adjust to the speed of the college game. His understanding of USC’s pro-style offense continues to grow as well.
More telling, though, is that Scroggins continues to get more opportunities than Kessler or Wittek. Although USC coach Lane Kiffin probably won’t reveal the depth chart until the fall, Scroggins is the clear favorite right now.
More importantly, Scroggins’ presence in the huddle appears to have improved. Last season, when he was relegated to a scout team role, Scroggins would sometimes stutter in the huddle out of nervousness as he was calling plays.
Now, Scroggins is talking about getting over his shy side and asserting himself.
“You’ve got to be the leader,” he told the Los Angeles Times last week. “You’ve got to be the guy that everybody likes.”
He could take plenty of direction from Barkley, who made his way into the starting lineup just about as soon as the ink had dried on his letter of intent. Barkley seemed to have that presence of leadership upon arrival, whereas Scroggins is still learning.
Then again, Barkley was forced into the role as a freshman. It makes more sense to ease Scroggins along at his own pace.
But in the world of sports, nothing is ever guaranteed. Whether he gets his name called tomorrow or never, Scroggins still has to be prepared. After all, Barkley has missed at least one game each of the last two seasons.
Even if Scroggins never plays a down this season, he has an opportunity to position himself to take over in the future if he continues to progress. That could happen as early as next season, if Barkley decides to skip his senior year and enter the draft.
Like all the backups who preceded him, the key for Scroggins is to remain patient without becoming complacent. He must make the most of every rep, every film session and every walkthrough.
No one knows when his time will come. But we all know how close it could be.

With the end of its regular season less than a week away, the No. 2 USC men’s tennis team, will look to close out its home schedule as it hosts UC Irvine at Marks Tennis Stadium today at 3 p.m.
Finshing strong · Senior Jaak Poldma looks to lead the Trojans to their 10th match win in a row over the Anteaters at Marks Stadium today. - Daily Trojan file photo 
As the Trojans’ (19-2, 5-0) Pac-10 schedule winds down with USC just a win away from clinching the conference title, the team is pleased with how its season has gone.
“Overall we’re right where we want to be, ranked in the top four,” said senior captain Jaak Poldma.
Before reaching such heights, however, the Trojans must contend with an Anteaters team that is surging after a convincing 5-2 win over Pacific and a 7-0 sweep of UC Davis — advancing to 4-0 in the Big West conference.
In preparation for its upcoming match, the team has been doing the same thing it has done all season long, practicing hard and working to stay healthy, especially with the Pac-10 championships and NCAA tournament on the horizon.
Yet although talk of a possible third consecutive national championship hasn’t subsided, the Trojans insist they haven’t lost their mental edge.
“Every match counts, and as its coming to an end, we want to go out on top,” Poldma said.
With Poldma and fellow senior Peter Lucassen, who was named Pac-10 Player of the Week last week, graduating this spring, it is important for the group’s younger players to perform well down the stretch, solidifying an already strong lineup from No. 1 to No. 6.
Poldma said he has been impressed with the younger players’ performances.
“[Freshman] Ray [Sarmiento] has a great record and he keeps getting better and better,” Poldma said. “He quickly adjusted to [college competition]. [Freshman] Michael [Grant] is now consistently at the six spot and has stepped up, and [freshman] Emilio [Gomez] is really good as well.”
Sarmiento leads the freshmen playing at No. 4, with Gomez and Grant at the No. 5 and No. 6 spots. Sarmiento has won every match he has not retired from because of injury.

Following Sunday’s win against Oregon, USC interim head coach Frank Cruz was incensed the sound system wasn’t working.
“Get it working. I don’t care if you have to wire it through your nose,” Cruz said with a smile to one of the equipment managers.
Taking the hill · Freshman Kyle Richter will start for the Trojans on Tuesday as they face Loyola Marymount. In the teams’ last contest in early April, Richter pitched one inning in relief, allowing just one hit, while striking out one batter. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
Cruz wanted to hear Laid Back’s 1983 song “White Horse” blaring as a tribute to Traveler, who stopped by Dedeaux Field to visit the team Saturday morning.
When the funkadelic tune finally came through the speakers, the team erupted into cheers and Cruz broke away from an interview to get in a final celebration with his team.
Cruz and his coaching staff have tried to keep a loose clubhouse this season — a drastic change from the strictly professional atmosphere harbored by former coach Chad Kreuter.
“We want these guys to feel invested. If they are feeling invested, they are going to give you more,” Cruz said. “If it’s what they like, we let them do it.”
But the staff also requires hard work. Cruz said he gives them three options at practice: “go soft and pay dearly, because I’m not going to like that,” “go hard and get a lot of achievement out of it” or “go home and not bother anyone.”
All season, mental and physical consistency has been preached to the players.
“The last couple and a half weeks, we’ve done a pretty good job of putting it together and I think definitely they’re getting more consistent,” Cruz said.
Though USC is still not the national powerhouse it once was, Cruz has the team playing solid baseball. The Trojans won five of their last seven games and have committed just four errors in the last two weeks.
“We’re just trying to stay with the process,” said junior outfielder Alex Sherrod. “The last couple of weekends we’ve put ourselves in a position to win the series and it felt good to [win] back-to-back Pac-10 series.”
But Cruz knows the next step in the development of his ball club is for it to be just as consistent away from Dedeaux Field.
The Trojans are only 2-9 on the road this year. Today, they open up an eight-game stretch during which they will play only one game at home.
USC will not have to go far today, however, when it travels 10 miles to George C. Page Stadium to take on Loyola Marymount.
Cruz will try to beat the school he led for 12 seasons for the second time in as many tries as the Trojans’ head man.
USC defeated the Lions 10-3 two weeks ago by jumping on Loyola Marymount early and often, scoring in six of its eight at bats.
Loyola Marymount, however, enters today’s contest with a 20-14 record and a better team batting average and ERA than USC.
The Trojans will face right-hander Jacob Smigelski, who gave up three runs in an inning of relief during the first matchup against USC. The 6-foot-3 freshman had a rough outing in his first career start last week against Cal State Fullerton, allowing five runs in two innings of work.
USC will also likely have a freshman on the mound, as southpaw Kyle Richter is expected to make his second career start.
Cruz said, however, he expects to use a combination of sophomore Matt Munson, senior Chris Mezger and juniors Brandon Garcia and Ben Mount, as well. He wants to limit each pitcher’s innings and have them all available for the weekend conference series against Washington, which will begin Thursday.
The combination of pitchers will have to shut down a Lions offense that has four hitters batting better than .300. Sophomore Matt Lowenstein leads the way with a .378 average and .464 on base percentage.
USC also has four batters hitting above .300, with junior Ricky Oropesa’s .348 average leading the way. If Oropesa and junior outfielder Garret Houts, who has hit .414 in his last 10 games, can provide enough offense, don’t be surprised to hear “White Horse” whooping from the team bus when it rolls onto campus tonight.

In early 2008, the indie scene was steadily pulsating with synthetic electro-pop.
And then, there were the Vivian Girls.
Unhappy days · Vivian Girls’ latest does not completely show the band’s strengths, and the longer tracks make the band seem worn out. - Photo courtesy of Polyvinyl Record Co. 
The Brooklyn-via-New Jersey trio of unassuming young women with thick bangs and floral minidresses attacked the indie stage with the fierceness of Marnie Stern and the grit of Sonic Youth.
Their 2008 self-titled debut, clocking in at a breathless 22 minutes, was a hard-hitting expose of 20-something post-Bush-administration angst that teemed with nihilistic sing-a-longs; they do, after all, have a song titled “I Believe in Nothing.”
In the years following the Vivian Girls’ debut and their 2009 follow-up Everything Goes Wrong, the scene had again shifted, and this time, in their favor.
Lo-fi noise-pop/punk/rock outfits bloated the blogosphere with the good, the bad and the wannabes.
The Vivian Girls no doubt played a major role in revitalizing the lo-fi movement and, much like their male counterparts No Age, arguably paved the way for the likes of Best Coast and the Dum Dum Girls.
Yet, much like No Age, the Vivian Girls arguably did it better than their successors, proving that, at least when it comes to crafting noise-pop tunes, the East Coast is indeed the better coast.
Until Share the Joy.
I don’t wanna be like the other girls, guitarist/vocalist Cassie Ramone sings in the opener “The Other Girls,” which serves as the record’s thesis statement.
No one can blame Ramone for not wanting to fall in line with the likes of the Dum Dum Girls with their too-close-for-comfort band moniker.
But Share the Joy becomes a self-conscious attempt to break both the band’s mold and the mold of what has been deemed acceptable in the present-day indie rock scene.
In their most hi-fi record to date, the Vivian Girls shed their fuzzed-out guitars and layers of drone to present a subtle yet clear change in pace and technique.
But in doing so, they hit a bit of an identity crisis, teetering between a new, glossed-over sound and the hard-edged sensibility of their past.
A six-minute-long jam session swelling with surf rock melodies, “The Other Girls” is a drastic variation of structure for the band that typically works within the confines of two-minute sprints.
It’s a marathon, which the Girls eventually finish, but at a leisurely pace.
What follows are two sugary-sweet ditties that seem to act as placeholders. Yes, Vivian Girls certainly share the joy on their latest effort, but it’s nowhere near as infectious as their angst.
“I Heard You Say” is a ’60s girl group throwback that rings true, if a bit flat, while the fluffy “Dance (If You Wanna)” bears a weightless melody and cotton-candy vocals that are even emptier than the band’s single-word track, “No,” off its self-titled debut.
“Lake House” falls the closest to the darker days of Everything Goes Wrong with its shady guitars and pummeling drums that charge like a racehorse unwilling to end the race, even when reaching the finish line.
The race continues on in “Trying to Pretend,” a scorned lover’s elegy set to a rapid-fire speed that shows the Girls’ peak form.
It’s that sense of urgency that made Vivian Girls first two full-lengths truly compelling, and Share the Joy’s lack of immediacy causes it to drift off course.
There’s a wavering conviction at work here, one that turns up for the aforementioned “Lake House” and the penultimate “Death,” a morbid girl-group track that’s as sunnily goth as Ariel Pink’s Haunted Graffiti, but unfortunately softens for the majority of the album.
Share the Joy does end on a high note — another six-minute long track to bookend the lengthy opener. Like “The Other Girls,” “Light in Your Eyes” is tinged with spiraling psychedelic riffs, yet there’s more of a push and pull between the instruments.
The competition is back, the race unwilling to end as the track careens into a steady grunge-rock jam with flashes of slide guitar and finishes abruptly with a guitar-and-drum blitzkrieg reminiscent of Everything Goes Wrong’s “Out for the Sun.”
It would be nearly unlistenable if Vivian Girls did not have such a fine way of creating elegance through their well-crafted dissonance.
By the album’s end, Vivian Girls solidified they will always be in a league of their own — if only they could have recognized that from the start.

Tina Fey has taken over. With the release of her critically lauded memoir Bossypants, Fey has officially become the queen of comedy.
Fey established herself as a comedic voice for women with her Saturday Night Live career beginning in 1997 and led to her being the show’s first female head writer. But it wasn’t until 30 Rock premiered in 2006 that Fey became a household name.
And now, after five seasons of astute cultural satire, Fey seems to have become the universally recognized proof that, yes, women are funny.
Fey might be the queen, but there is hardly a shortage of funny women on television these days, from the wives and daughters on Modern Family to the comediennes of SNL.
Although these female roles are not adequately diverse (the only women on Modern Family are thin, beautiful housewives), at least it’s understood that women can make men laugh, too.
But this isn’t the case in film. Most female-centered comedies are seen as chick flicks or romantic comedies: two genres assumed to deter all males.
Women in these movies are so often limited to the role of sex object or they spend the entire movie trying to become the man’s object of desire.
They might be able to crack a joke, but they’re mostly there to be looked at. Especially considering the assumption men don’t appreciate female humor, there’s not a lot of room in the market for funny women to take the lead.
The new Judd Apatow-produced comedy Bridesmaids looks to be out to break, or at least bend, the mold of female-driven comedies.
A month before its theatrical release, it is already being called the “female version of The Hangover,” and “a potential game-changer for female comedy” by Moviefone.com and others.
Written by SNL’s Kristin Wiig and Annie Mumolo, the film centers around an unemployed, unlucky-in-love 30-something woman (Wiig) who is asked to be the maid of honor for her childhood best friend. Hilarity ensues as she and the motley crew of bridesmaids engage in the painful tradition of pre-wedding rituals.
A wedding plot doesn’t sound so game-changing for women in film, but movie critic Jen Yamato calls Bridesmaids “the anti-Sex and the City and Bride Wars,” which is an incredibly promising endorsement.
She describes the film as being “about awkwardness, insecurity and friendship that talks the way real women talk,” something that sounds like a refreshing and tremendous change from the oh-so-scripted dialogue that spills from the attractive lips of Katherine Heigl or Kate Hudson in any number of forgettable rom-coms.
Though Bridesmaids might have required the Apatow stamp of approval (you’ve sadly still got to have at least one powerful man behind you to get anything done in Hollywood), it features a strong female ensemble with an impressive improv pedigree.
These actresses come from The Groundlings and Upright Citizens Brigade, some of the best comedy troupes in the country, and now work on shows like SNL, The Office and Reno 911. These are top-notch comediennes, not just actresses who can pull off occasional one-liners while looking pretty.
Fey, Wiig and company prove funny women are out there, and they can be just as crude and lewd as the boys. Now it’s just a matter of giving them some screen time.
Apatow might write some solid supporting roles for women in his comedies, but he admits he focuses on men because they’re what he knows. And his movies have come to define a generation of man-children.
But when only 7 percent of directors, 10 percent of writers and 15 percent of executive producers in Hollywood are women, according to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University, it’s really no wonder most comedies (and dramas and everything else) revolve around men.
There just aren’t enough female filmmakers to tell women-centered stories in which finding Mr. Right is not the ultimate goal in life.
Bridesmaids might include some sex and romance, but it also delves into and satirizes the dynamics between women.
With more women in the industry, female audiences might actually get to see characters and storylines resemble real life.
Many women are capable of executing a traditionally male style of humor, but they shouldn’t always have to do so to be recognized.
One can only hope that Bridesmaids is just the beginning. Maybe soon, women can be funny like women, or better yet, just plain funny.

Coachella has come and gone, and the thousands of music fans in attendance have left Indio’s desert and returned to reality. As expected with such a large and diverse festival, some bands connected with the crowd, while others, like the highly criticized Ariel Pink, failed. Here’s a recap of some of the festival’s highs and lows.
Miles Howard | Daily Trojan 
ENTERTAINING
Arcade Fire
Ever since Arcade Fire’s formation, the band has been hailed as a great live act. After three albums and a huge increase in popularity, the band hasn’t lost its signature energy.
The indie outfit worked its way through diverse selections from its catalogue, culminating in a goose bump-inducing “Wake Up,” during which dozens of giant white balls were dropped on the crowd. During the encore, those balls lit up with different colors in sync with the music, providing an incredible visual display. Many of the audience members left the festival with those glowing balls as souvenirs, and the rest left simply with the memory of a great headlining set.
 
OFWGKTA
Odd Future’s Coachella debut was one of the most buzzed about performances of the festival. So much so that the anxious crowd forcefully pushed its way into the hot tent before electronic DJ Skrillex even finished.
Many speculated the performance would mark the return of mysteriously missing member Earl Sweatshirt.
Others just expected the show to live up to the group’s previous energetic performances.
Only the latter expectation was fulfilled, but the first didn’t go unmentioned.
The group led the crowd in its signature chants of “Free Earl,” and a few members donned “Earl” t-shirts. OFWGKTA leader Tyler, The Creator was vocal about those that have investigated Earl’s whereabouts, saying “there’s a difference between entertainment and family” before harshly berating Complex magazine for trying to track down the young and talented rapper.
Drama aside, Odd Future put on an entertaining show.
The rappers dove into the audience several times as they tore through songs. There was even a guest appearance from one of Tyler, The Creator’s biggest heroes, the Neptunes’ Pharrell.
It was exciting to see such energy from the young group.
 
UNDERRATED
The Aquabats
While many were being entertained by dark electronic group Crystal Castles across the polo field, The Aquabats were delivering a more lighthearted, yet still extremely awesome, set to a smaller crowd of dedicated fans.
The Aquabats’ live show is something like the musical version of bizarre comedy duo Tim & Eric as a band of costumed superheroes with an oddball sense of humor. Their performances aim for both laughs and confused looks. Both of those were present Friday night, along with some moshing and skanking to the ska-punk songs.
At one point the group “brought out the Kings of Leon,” which were actually two actors humorously dressed as the band’s members that appeared for only about 10 seconds.
 
The Felice Brothers
New York country rockers The Felice Brothers catered to a small but rowdy crowd in one of the  more cramped tents.
Those who weren’t in attendance missed out, as Bright Eyes singer Conor Oberst joined the band onstage for a song and then watched the remainder of the set from the side of the stage. It’s collaborations like this that make festivals great.
DISAPPOINTING
Animal Collective
Animal Collective often confuses fans with its live shows. The band doesn’t normally play its own hits like the insanely catchy “My Girls.” Instead, they jam on more recent songs and sprinkle in hints of more recognizable tunes, like some sort of futuristic jam band.
That’s exactly what the group did Saturday night, and it was highly entertaining for anyone who’s a true fan of the band.
To the casual listener, however, the band’s unusual set list and reliance on psychedelic images and lights were a bit of a let-down.

There is nothing as perfect as a grilled cheese sandwich.
Just think about it: A layer of warm cheese slowly melting in between two pieces of bread as the whole deck gets toasted in fragrant butter.
What’s more, it’s inexpensive while incorporating the three most necessary food groups: carbs, fat and dairy.

Grilled cheese ranks among America’s favorite comfort foods, so it is no wonder a whole month is dedicated to celebrating the grilled cheese sandwich.
Iconic foods like the grilled cheese carry a lot of personal traditions and sentiments.
You might smirk, but for some people, making a good grilled cheese is a serious art.
In fact, there are people who make a profession out of it.
Take Eric Greenspan, chef of The Foundry on Melrose, who has won awards for a sandwich he made with fruity taleggio cheese on raisin bread with apricot-caper puree.
There’s also the Grilled Cheese food truck which serves an obscenely good Mac and Cheese melt.
Like art, the grilled cheese is open to interpretation as long as you have the basic components down. All you need is bread, cheese and butter.
But this is where things get complicated. What kind of bread? How much cheese and butter?
In honor of National Grilled Cheese Month, we answer some  of those burning questions about grilled cheese sandwiches.
Bread
If you are a traditionalist, you can’t go wrong with white sandwich bread.
But consider trying something new. Nothing too dense or too limp, as you want something that holds well to the cheese without drowning out its flavor.
A good rule of thumb is for each slice to be no thicker than half an inch.
A nutty bread like a multi-grain loaf or a flax-walnut loaf brings a lovely crunch, while a cheddar jalapeño bread can accentuate the cheesiness while tingling the tongue with a hint of capsicum heat.
Anything with a slightly sweet characteristic, like cranberry bread or a brioche, can bring out a sharp sweet versus savory contrast.
Just make sure it doesn’t have too many complex flavors or spices, as you don’t want to overwhelm the flavor profile.
Cheese
What is a grilled cheese sandwich without proper cheese?
Forget vegan nut cheese (even Daiya) or fat-free cheese. If you want to be happy, stick to the real deal.
The more cheese, the better; aim for at least two ounces. To get the cheese melting evenly, try finely grating or shaving it first, as this contributes to the gooey, melty factor.
America’s favorite cheese has always been Kraft singles. There is nothing wrong with the classic, orange, American cheese; with a side of Campbell’s tomato soup, a grilled cheese sandwich hits the spot.
But why limit yourself? There are more than 500 varieties of cheese according to the International Dairy Federation, and practically any of them can fit into a sandwich.
Ralphs and Trader Joe’s both have impressive selections of gourmet cheeses, such as smoked gouda, manchego and aged white cheddar, that work well in grilled cheeses.
You can also use whatever leftover cheese you have in the fridge, like cream cheese and provolone. As a general rule, anything that melts, works.
Butter
There is simply no adequate substitute for pure, full-fat butter. It’s not just to crisp up the bread — it also infuse a creamy flavor and adds a hint of nuttiness.
There is a reason why the best restaurants use butter for their grilled sandwiches. Take a deep inhale of the rich, milky aroma as you cook your sandwich in bubbling fat, and you’ll be convinced: Butter is the way to go.
For the best result, use salted butter that has been softened slightly to room temperature. It enables even distribution of perfect crispness to the exterior of the bread, while soaking up the interior with its full richness.
Bonus
After getting the bread, cheese and butter down, the rest is up to you.
Experiment with bonus ingredients to make the sandwich more interesting and personal. There are endless possibilities for customizing your sandwich, from exotic ingredients like kimchi to preserves like grape jelly or apricot preserves.
For inspiration, visit Clementine, located near Santa Monica Boulevard. This bakery-café annually creates a new grilled cheese sandwich every day in April.
Even Denny’s has fun with the grilled cheese concept with its wacky fried cheese melt: deep-fried mozzarella cheese sticks stuffed into a grilled cheese sandwich.
Crazy? Maybe. Fun? Absolutely. Delicious? That’s for you to judge.
Don’t forget to mention that those cheese sandwiches need to be eaten only on occasion or your blood vessels will surely clog!
YEEEEEE Sophia!! Go on and tout the virtues of grilled cheese for realsies, girlie!
Great article Sophia!  I love grilled cheeses, especially with fancy bread and cheese!  
There is a gourmet cheese market by my office where you can get little nubs of cheeses that normally sell for $19.99 a pound and up, but for a few dollars or less, I can get a wedge good enough for one sandwich!

In the 2008 presidential election, an estimated 22 to 24 million young Americans voted, the highest voter turnout since 1972, according to msnbc.com.
Sixty-six percent of Democratic votes in 2008 came from voters between the ages of 18 and 29 years old, according to the Pew Research Center.
That age bracket was integral to President Barack Obama’s successful campaign. Young voters contributed numbers, but also a spirited commitment to the idea of change, helping to launch the Obama wave across the nation.
Obama kicked off his re-election campaign last week.
Even though the political landscape is very different now than it was in 2008, young voters can still make a difference.
Among the possible Republican contenders in 2012 are some familiar faces from 2008 (Sarah Palin, Mike Huckabee) as well as some unanticipated ones (Donald Trump, Michele Bachmann).
Since taking office, Obama has developed a more centrist leadership style, which has undoubtedly impacted the opinions of Democrats, Republicans and moderates alike.
The President finds himself dealing with a budget crisis that has left many Democrats who might have supported him four years ago dissatisfied and openly critical.
But what hasn’t changed since 2008 is the youth’s importance to the electoral process and its outcome.
No matter their political allegiance, students can determine the outcome of the next presidential election. Getting excited about voting next year while being passionate and informed on key issues is vital.
Despite the huge turnout in 2008, young Americans regressed to passivity in the 2010 midterm elections: Only 9 percent of 18-29 year olds voted, down from 18 percent just two years before. Many students felt their votes wouldn’t make a difference, or that they just weren’t as in touch with the issues at hand in the midterm elections.
It’s time to get excited again.
The 2012 presidential election is crucial for a variety of reasons. Future leadership will determine the fate of countless issues at the forefront of national debate: health care, the budget, economic progress, education, climate change and illegal immigration. Even more relevant for students are issues of unemployment, the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act and rising college costs in the context of the struggling economy.
It might sound idealistic or cliché, but finding an issue to be genuinely passionate about is what will allow students to make a difference in 2012.
In 2008, that was an active belief in Obama’s trademark trifecta: hope, action and change. In 2012, it’s up to you.
Taking action by joining a club, taking a class, attending a seminar, reading the news or engaging in anything that complements your passion will ensure the fervent motivation our generation needs for 2012.
Enhancing civil discourse would also be beneficial. It would be both informative and encouraging to see more public student debates held on campus.
Since the youth have the chance to truly make a difference next year, paying attention to and staying informed about such issues is crucial. This is not the time to be apathetic or uninformed.
The 2012 presidential election might be the first time you vote. It might the third or fourth. But no matter what, 2012 will be a defining year. Get passionate about the election, and make sure your vote is an informed one.

Earth Week was fun when I was in elementary school. Each year, my class would bake cookies in solar-powered ovens or trek to some local park, where teachers would cheer on either Team Stratosphere or Team Thermosphere as they raced to collect the most trash.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
I recall testing the pH of nearby rivers and, after a laborious afternoon of taking samples, concluding they were, in fact, gross, though most of us had arrived at the same conclusion three hours earlier when the first bucket of water drawn up included a tire iron and a pair of pants.
We enjoyed these activities when we were kids. Whereas these days we step over spilled trash and neglect the recycling bin because it’s on the other side of the room, we once tackled each other to the ground over who got to pick up a discarded Pepsi can.
It probably helped that whoever won was promised an otter pop. Luckily for USC students, this year’s Earth Week is packed with events and activities to make the week as exciting as it once was.
Earth Week is as good a time as any to get into the lighter side of environmentalism, and there’s also no better time to actually get educated on all things green.
Campus organizations this year have stepped up their game to provide a surprising number of events, both educational and entertaining, aimed at pretty much every student demographic.
The information about sustainability, climate change and even basic things like recycling doesn’t get much more accessible than it will be this week — let’s be sure to take advantage of it.
If you picked up this paper in front of Leavey Library, you’re probably also standing next to a new Chevrolet Volt, which CalPIRG arranged to have brought to campus today as part of the Green Tech Fair, a combined effort by various campus organizations to showcase the latest in green technology.
“It’s important for people to see that going green is more than just cutting back on things,” said Koushaw Ghaffarian, a sophomore majoring in economics/mathematics and political science who helped coordinate the display. “[Environmental] education can also be about more fun stuff like this.”
The “fun stuff” even extends to Westwood. Friday (Earth Day) will mark the culmination of Unite For Green, a semester-long contest between USC and UCLA that kicked off in November at the USC-UCLA football game. The competition tracks which school has the highest attendance at various green events throughout the semester (USC is ahead as of press time). The winning school gets a solar-powered concert on its campus next semester, which should provide at least as much incentive as an otter pop to go get your green on.
Unite For Green has also coordinated an event with ROTC on Friday night in case you want to find out how many pushups it takes to power a lightbulb.
Meanwhile, Net Impact is hosting a waste program on The Row, a panel to discuss issues of sustainability and a fashion show.
Casey Quon, a senior majoring in environmental studies and one of the students leading Greening the Greeks, the CalPIRG competition to see which house can reduce its carbon footprint the most, said many students seem to be regaining their enthusiasm for events like these.
Students will inevitably go to events like the fashion show and the Chevrolet display more for entertainment than for education. But it would be a waste to merely glance over these efforts and not come away with anything.
Stay a few minutes longer at the Green Tech displays and find out the benefits of owning a hybrid car. Ask about the logistics of bringing solar power to campus.
At the very least, grab an otter pop and browse the booths on Trousdale.
Just remember to recycle the wrapper.
