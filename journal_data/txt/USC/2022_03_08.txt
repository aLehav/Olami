Why are we watching this? 
That’s a question many Los Angeles Lakers faithful likely asked themselves during an abject loss to the Pelicans last week. Luckily for us here at Coast to Coast, basketball is still fun to watch elsewhere. 
Here are my thoughts on those other games, starting down in the Grand Canyon State.
The Phoenix Suns’ quiet dominance
What’s up with the Phoenix Suns? 
You’d be forgiven for thinking they’re in a down year with the complete lack of media coverage they receive. Take a gander at the standings, though, and you’ll be surprised to know they sit comfortably at the top of the Western Conference at 51-13. 
Contributions from around the squad have kept the team humming despite extended absences for point guard Chris Paul and star shooting guard Devin Booker, who both recently entered Health & Safety protocols. 
Forward Cam Johnson went for a career-high 38 against the Knicks last week, including a game-winning 3-pointer, picking up some of the scoring slack. Former Thunder guard Cameron Payne chipped in too, scoring 40 points over the Suns’ last two games.
Despite falling to the Bucks on Sunday, the Suns remain on course for a spectacular 65-win season.
Coach K says goodbye
For over 40 years, Duke’s Mike Krzyzewski has been the face of college basketball coaches. By far the most successful coach in the modern era, Coach K has led the Blue Devils to five national championships and 12 Final Fours. On his way to racking up more wins than any other head coach in Division I history, Krzyzewski picked up six gold medals coaching Team USA. 
A student of the game, Coach K adapted to the one-and-done era of college basketball better than any of the old-school coaches. His Blue Devils famously recruited the top three recruits in the class of 2018, creating the greatest modern-day recruiting class of all time. 
Even before Krzyzewski was snapping up America’s top recruits, Duke saw sustained success. Coach K took home championships in three different decades, cutting down the nets in the ’90s, ’00s and ’10s. 
Duke, however, fell to UNC 94-81 last Saturday, a fitting conclusion to a storied run in the rivalry for Coach K. The Tar Heels have been a consistent thorn in Duke’s side, with former Head Coach Dean Smith posting a 24-14 record against Krzyzewski. 
The last installment of the series was supposed to be a walk in the park for the Blue Devils, but the Tar Heels were never ones to follow a script.
The battle for L.A.: 8th seed edition
What an era it was supposed to be for Los Angeles basketball. The scrappy Clippers picked up forwards Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the summer of 2019 that saw the Lakers reload with forward Anthony Davis. The City of Angels would be the center of the NBA universe, conference finals played at Staples year after year. 
Alas, that golden dream never came to fruition. A championship season for the Lakers was followed by a couple of seasons of abject mediocrity. For the Clippers, a first conference finals appearance in team history has been followed by constant visits from the injury bug.
This season has been worse still for both teams — the Lakers, in particular, becoming difficult to watch. They’ve sunk so far the players are trash-talking their home fans. 
Some commentators have even asked if it’s time for the Lakers to explore a LeBron James trade. They mortgaged their future to support his championship pursuits, but they’re far from contention. A hard reset might be just what the Lakers need. 
A team that needs 56-point explosions from a 37-year old LeBron to snap a four-game losing streak is not a team ready to reach the promised land again.
USC Basketball takes a couple of haymakers
It was a rough week for the USC men’s basketball team as it was outclassed at home by Arizona and pulled up just short at UCLA. 
Currently a projected 6-seed, the Trojans will look to improve their seeding with a couple of wins at the Pac-12 tournament in Las Vegas this week. To have a shot at moving up the bracket, USC will likely have to avenge both losses they suffered last week.
It enters the Pac-12 Tournament as the No. 3 seed with a possible matchup against the Bruins in the semifinals Friday.

USC beach volleyball wrapped up its first tournament of the 2022 season Sunday, finishing the Battle for L.A. Invitational 3-1 through two days of play.
The No. 1 Trojans opened the tournament at Mapes Beach Saturday morning with a 2-3 loss against their crosstown rival, No. 2 UCLA. USC and the Bruins had split their last two meetings, with UCLA taking home the 2021 Pac-12 Championship and the Trojans the 2021 NCAA championship. 
Saturday, the Trojans picked up their 2 points on court 2 with graduate student Sammy Slater and sophomore Megan Kraft, as well as court 3 with graduate student Julia Scoles and sophomore Delaynie Maple. 
“I don’t think we played with the urgency required to beat UCLA,” Head Coach Dain Blanton said. “We need to train to be focused from the first whistle until the end … you can’t take your foot off the gas.”
The Trojans bounced back quickly, however, with a 4-1 home victory over No. 7 Grand Canyon at Merle Norman stadium Saturday afternoon. The Trojans won across courts 1-4, dropping a point on court 5.
“I think it’s just coming out a little bit more mentally prepared,” junior Nicole Nourse said. “It’s always being ready … The fact that we put ourselves in a very good mental position, it allowed the physical play to just flow.”
For USC, being prepared is no simple exercise. It requires being focused and motivated during practice, warm-ups and throughout the entire match.
“[It’s about] competing every single day, bringing positive energy every single day, and just having a growth mindset, so that in May we are looking back with no regrets from our training that we are doing now,” graduate student Shannon Scully said. 
The Trojans were able to carry the momentum from Saturday afternoon’s victory into their matches Sunday, where they swept No. 8 Stanford and No. 14 Long Beach State at Merle Norman stadium 5-0.
Senior Tina Graudina and graduate student Hailey Harward won both matches Sunday on the first court, as did Kraft and Slater on court 2, Scoles and Maple on court 3 and senior Mollie Eberton and graduate student Sunny Villapando on court 5. 
Nourse won 2 points on court 4, paired once with her twin sister Audrey, and once paired with Scully. 
“You are going to have some wins and some losses, but the key is that we become better volleyball players and get closer to reaching our potential,” Blanton said. “I thought we made massive strides from yesterday morning’s match until the end here against Long Beach.”
One of those improvements was the energy USC played with. Over the course of the weekend, the Trojans found the competitive edge and team spirit that Blanton noticed lacking during their first match. 
“Our team support and our competitive energy and just staying together as a team was really good,” Scully said. “ I think we can keep doing that every single game moving forward.” 
This tournament, however, is just one of many that the Trojans will face on the road back to the championship in May. The season will have them traveling to tournaments in Florida (twice), Arizona and across California on the way to the Pac-12 and NCAA championships. 
“It’s just another box that is checked in a list that is leading up to NCAAs,” Nourse said. “We know who we represent, we know the program that we represent and we understand what it takes to be a USC Trojan. When we come out here, we have the opportunity to show that every single time. There is not even an opportunity to let the other team think that they have a chance.”
USC’s next challenge will be the Stetson Sun-N-Sand Invitational tournament in Deland, Fla. next weekend, where it will face No. 3 Florida State, No. 12 Florida Atlantic, Tampa and No. 16 Stetson. 
The first match begins Saturday morning.
“We won last year and that’s great,” Nourse said. “But we are out here to make a statement. We are out here to do it again.”

USC returns to Los Angeles Tuesday to face off against No. 10 Princeton for its second home game of the season after two big road victories. Last week, the Trojans debuted in the IWLCA Division I Poll at No. 23. This week, they advanced to No. 17. 
As USC returns to play after over a week off, Assistant Coach Lauren Gunning notes how difficult it can be to gain momentum after a bye week in the middle of the season. 
However, Gunning said this time off has also allowed the team to focus on themselves and “work out some of the little kinks and things that we might not normally have the opportunity to do in season.” 
With victories against No. 20 Jacksonville and Mercer on the road, the Trojans progressed to a 3-0 start for the fourth time in program history. 
USC defeated Jacksonville 13-12 in a game that came down to the wire. With under three minutes left in the game, sophomore attacker Shelby Tilton scored the game-winning goal, securing the victory for the team and a hat trick for herself. 
Two days later, the Trojans outplaced Mercer 15-7 in Georgia. Redshirt junior Kait Devir put up 14 saves for the weekend. The league recognized these performances by naming Tilton and Devir Pac-12 Offensive and Defensive Players of The Week, respectively. 
“We know we’re a great team,” said veteran junior defensive player Danielle Carson in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “But it definitely helped, beating a ranked team, giving us confidence that we can compete against anyone and we’re just as good as everyone else.”
Carson and the team have been working hard on and off the field this week and are excited to finally get back into game play. 
“We’re coming out positive, confident and we really think we can beat them,” she said. 
Princeton has recorded several notable victories this season. The Tigers were ranked No. 15 in the IWLCA preseason poll but quickly advanced to No. 11 after a 17-11 victory in their season opener against then No. 10 UVA. 
The following week, Princeton defeated No. 20 Temple 14-10, moving the Tigers to No. 10. They also secured their first in-league victory against Cornell this past weekend. Princeton is favored to top the Ivy League and boast two players on the Tewaaraton Award watch list: senior defensive player Marge Donovan and senior attacker Kyla Sears. 
Gunning said that when facing talented opponents such as the Tigers, the key is for the Trojans to focus on themselves. 
“We spent the last two weeks focusing on us and our systems and buying into the things that we do and we do really well,” she said. “I think as long as we stick to us and our game plan and trust the people on the field with us, we’re gonna be in a great position.”
The game against Princeton will be USC’s final game before conference play begins versus Colorado Friday. Gunnings said that each of these games is an opportunity to grow and tune up before Pac-12 play.  
The Trojans look to secure their fourth straight win this season against No. 10 Princeton at Soni McAlister Field Tuesday at 3 p.m.

In August 2020, USC alumna Lucy Santora requested a mail-in ballot from her home state of Texas. As November approached, her ballot had still not arrived. She called the Texas Democratic Party, the Texas Republican Party and the voter hotline, but amid the “chaotic” pandemic, their answers remained the same: They didn’t know where her ballot was, and a lot of other people had the same problem. 
“I was just very frustrated because I was like, ‘Of everything else that’s kind of gone haywire this year, [voting] should be the one thing I should be able to do,’” Santora said. 
After watching the 2020 election results come in and flipping through different news channels, she realized the lack of information surrounding voting. As someone born in a conservative town but raised by liberal parents, Santora said she felt especially equipped to write a book about voting that anyone can read, especially since most conversations around voting become “very partisan, very quickly.” 
“I wanted to create something that brought together the good things from both sides of the political spectrum because I don’t think that anyone’s totally right or totally wrong,” Santora said. “And also present it in a way where, as just an everyday person living in America, you’d be able to understand why voting matters for you personally and how that can be something that’s empowering for you and your community to make the change that you actually want to experience.”
Once Santora decided that she wanted to write a book — something that has always been on her bucket list — the next step was to figure out where to start. With a virtual job, a master’s degree and a lot of extra free time because of the pandemic, she decided to reach out to a Georgetown professor to join his class on book writing. On Jan. 21, 2021, she started writing the book and by December, “Ballot Boxing” was written and published. 
Though her passion for voting rights grew after the 2020 election, Santora already had experience with the research. Robert Labaree, a political science and international relations librarian, first met Santora in 2018 when she was a research assistant at USC with professor Carol Wise. Labaree recalls that she consistently reached out to him for research help, involving both her personal research and as an assistant. 
Labaree said Santora recently contacted him to donate a copy of her book to the USC Library. “Ballot Boxing” will be available in the International and Public Affairs library in the next couple of weeks. 
Melody Brown-Clark, USC alumna and Santora’s college friend, said that when Santora struggled to obtain a 2020 election ballot, she was fully prepared to fly home to vote in-person in case her ballot didn’t arrive. She remembers Santora talking about the importance of voting and encouraging the people around her to register.
Brown-Clark said that, over the past four years, she has seen Santora grow into her passions. Watching Santora channel her passions into a book “so well and in such a short period of time was amazing” she said.
“Not that it wasn’t a big deal, but it just came so naturally to her that she made it look easy. It never even seemed hard,” Brown-Clark said. 
After reading some of “Ballot Boxing,” Brown-Clark said she felt that Santora has a talent for saying things plainly — and she looks forward to finishing Santora’s book.
“[Santora] is able to put these crazy complex ideas that she understands perfectly in her head into plain words so that other people can understand it,” Brown-Clark said.
Labaree described Santora as “intellectually curious” and as the type of person that you know is “going to do good things in the world.”
“Lucy is just one of those students,” Labaree said. “Just ‘Not only am I studying this on my own, but I want to reach out to somebody to learn what other additional resources are available so I can get a complete picture of the research problem that I’m investigating.”’
Santora said she hopes that people will understand the importance of voting after reading her book, and, most importantly, actually go out and vote. With new restrictive voting laws popping up across the country, she reminds readers that to preserve their power, they need to keep voting even if the “system is messed up.” 
“Our political system does not reward a lack of participation, because what they look at, at the end of the day, is ‘this many people voted that they still want this person in power,’” Santora said. “So that person still gets to be in power and do whatever they want … It’s important for people to jump through those extra hurdles that they’re creating to vote so that you can vote them out.”

Psychedelic rock duo Drew & Luke are not only bandmates boasting an electric combination of guitar and harmonica — they’re also brothers. In some cases, growing up with a younger brother means constant tussling and endless fighting in the backseat, but that wasn’t the case for Drew Cooper, a senior majoring in music industry. 
Hailing from Philadelphia, Drew and his younger brother Luke, a student at Santa Monica College, have been producing music in various genres for years. Their latest musical adventure has been performing as a psychedelic rock band, inspired by the classic rock scene of the late ’60s and early ’70s. From sound to style, the duo seems to have it down.
However, finding their way to the stages of hip music bars in downtown Los Angeles was not a straight nor easy path. It took many years of instrumental practice, experimentation with genre cultures and practice in audience engagement for the Cooper brothers to get to where they are now. First, of course, they needed the spark of inspiration. 
This spark came when the brothers were young, strapped into the backseat of their mother’s car during road trips. It was here, with the music that their mom played from the car stereo, that they began to develop a love for rock. 
“She’d play a bunch of old music — Grateful Dead, the Stones, that sort of thing — and quiz us on who was singing each song. I was never very good at it,” Luke said. “But she used those long car rides with a captive audience to teach us about good music.”
Not long after, Drew and Luke began to dabble in creating music themselves, though their early creations differed greatly from what they had heard on those long car rides. Instead, they poured their creativity into the production of electronic dance music, naming themselves “CPR,” their last name with vowels omitted. 
Benji Bacharach, a senior majoring in psychology, recalls being roommates with Drew during their freshman year at USC and seeing the dedication with which Drew and Luke collaborated on their music. From hearing the brothers speak constantly about their projects over the phone and experiencing many of their live EDM performances, Bacharach picked up on the dynamic shared between the duo. 
“Luke has always been really good with the … creation of different music. He would just be like, ‘I can make you a cool song in five minutes, just give me a sec,’” Bacharach said. “Drew was always really good at DJing and being able to get a crowd moving … Everyone loved their sound and listening to them.”
Amid the pandemic, however, with the inability to perform live shows, the duo took the opportunity to test out a different style. Going back to the music that had inspired them, Drew and Luke began creating music that was more in line with what their mom had first taught them to love all those years ago. 
“We kind of circled back to the music of our mom’s teachings,” Drew said. “We just went for a deep dive and landed on blues and ’60s rock and roll … We picked up the guitar, started singing a little bit, and that’s how it started.” 
As both their image and music style evolved, the brothers decided to swap the name CPR for a more straightforward title: the name “Drew & Luke.”
“We wanted something that was … very authentically our roots and who we are. What better than to just be our names? Nothing hiding behind there,” Drew said. 
After honing their instrumentation skills and deciding to the most specific degree what kind of music they wanted to play, Drew & Luke are now fully leaning into their identity as a psychedelic rock ‘n’ roll duo.
The evolution of their music has proved to be a successful endeavor, as the two have been performing their latest music for live audiences in venues across L.A., from a night at The Hotel Cafe to their three-week residency at Harvard and Stone. Accompanying them on stage are friends and bandmates Blake Stamato, Nick Springer and Nick Imig — all students at USC.
Friends of the band, though surprised by the stark difference between the music of Drew & Luke and that of CPR, are greatly impressed by the dedication with which Drew and Luke committed to their evolution as musicians. The bluesy, late ’60s-inspired rock that they play is full of energy, and the duo’s electrifying stage presence only adds fuel to the fire, from Drew’s solos on the electric to Luke jumping off stage and dancing with the crowd.
“I like their music a lot now. I feel like it brings a lot of energy to it. It’s fun to dance to, too,” said Bacharach, who is still a roommate to Drew and Luke four years later. “I love going to them and supporting them. It’s starting to become like a little community … You’ll see a lot of familiar faces there.”
In the process of refining their new style, the brothers’ dynamic as bandmates, which Bacharach observed in their EDM-producing days, continued to strengthen, as each of them has further defined and embraced their role within the band. 
“Luke is the band leader as the lead singer … He really has the main vision musically. Being his older brother, I’d say I’m the bandleader in life. So I like to boss him around otherwise,” said Drew jokingly.
Though Luke handles the arranging and producing and is the one getting the band together for rehearsals, Drew takes the lead on the business side of things, contacting venues and arranging times and places for the band to perform. 
“It ends up being a good dynamic,” Luke said. “We wouldn’t be playing without the gigs.”
With each handling a side of the helm, the duo forges into March and April with exciting gigs lined up in old and new venues. Though their community of loyal listeners continues to show up and dance, the duo hopes that more lovers of music will come out to experience what they’ve created, not heeding any labels or genre constrictions, but simply to enjoy the music. 
“We take lots of inspiration from the music of the late ’60s … But I don’t care what you call it,” Luke said. “If you like what we’re playing, then you like it. You like to come experience it with us … I want to get you in the door because maybe I can put you onto something.” 
From electronic dance music to classic rock and from Philly to L.A., it all comes back to a team of two brothers who are driven to create and perform, guaranteed to get your feet moving.
Information on Drew & Luke’s tour dates and locations can be found on the duo’s website.

It’s spring: the season of new beginnings. You look out the window in the morning and the sky is at its bluest, with its fluffiest clouds on show. Cherry blossoms sway in the light breeze and you grab a cardigan as the sun sheds its rays on the freshly mowed campus lawns. 
Alas, campus life is so romantic, but we find ourselves in the midst of midterms during this beautiful season. But don’t worry, there is a way to idealize the perfect campus experience without stressing about the stacking assignments. There’s a way to find growth and kindle self-appreciation during these moments of burnout: K-dramas.
“My ID is Gangnam Beauty”
Want the full experience of Korean campus life? Adapted from a WEBTOON, this drama portrays the fluttering freshman experience. It also reflects the suffocating obsession and societal expectations over appearance. Society belittles a little girl by calling her ugly, disgusting, a troll. The little girl, Mi-rae, lives in shameful self-doubt and self-deprecation over her appearance and undergoes full plastic surgery before going to college with the determination to start fresh.
In college, Mi-rae is a shining star, the prettiest girl in the room. But this drama reveals the bittersweet reality of college life, where rumors fly and opinions heap — especially about appearance. It also depicts Mi-rae’s growth to slowly accept herself and disregard the voice of others. Of course, there is a romantic relationship involved with Do Kyung-seok, who rescues Mi-rae from uncomfortable confrontations and clears her clouded judgment of others and her obsession with a perfect complexion. The scenic campus shots are enough to move your heart by depicting spring at its finest.
“Cheese in the Trap”
Another one adapted from a WEBTOON, this drama highlights the ups and downs of a realistic college life. Hong Seol grinds through the competitive battlefield of grades and scholarships, fending off classmates who prey on her assignments. Then Yoo Jung appears. Hong Seol senses a hostile standoffish vibe behind the perfect mask who’s always in the center of attention with perfect grades and a perfect personality. Subconsciously drawn to him, Hong Seol engages in the romantic struggles of dating Yoo Jung, a complex character who slowly heals from his past trauma through their relationship. The tender series reflects the growth and learning of two characters who grew up with an impoverished sense of trust in others.
“Weightlifting Fairy, Kim Bok-Joo”
This one is quite different. As you may have guessed from the title, Kim Bok-Joo is a collegiate weightlifter. While other college girls starve to fit into miniskirts and apply glittery layers of makeup to go clubbing, Kim Bok-Joo eats platters of chicken and stacks up on protein to gain muscle and lift weights.
Suddenly, she has a crush for the first time. Kim Bok-Joo wants to switch her training pants for a dress, she wants to pin a cute hair clip and be a “regular” college girl. The consensus of the drama is Kim Bok-Joo learning to appreciate herself as her longtime friendship with a swim athlete progresses into a romantic relationship. It’s not your regular romance drama, though, with Kim Bok-Joo throwing uppercuts all the while — it’s a comedic drama about healing and young love.
“Nevertheless”
Also adapted from a WEBTOON, this show gained high appraise for its accurate visual casting of the two leads. Yoo Na-Bi is an art student studying sculpture when she meets the enticing Park Jae-Eon. He bears a butterfly tattoo on the back of his neck and Na-Bi, which means butterfly in Korean, feels a strong attraction to his mysterious aura of confidence. Park Jae-Eon is not the ideal boyfriend; nevertheless, Na-Bi finds herself in the midst of his easy neglect and dark nonchalance. You’ll probably be ranting at Park Jae-Eon’s trashy behavior, but the strong analogies between the difficult sculpting process and an unsteady relationship depict the perfect reality of many college campus relationships.
“Age of Youth”
A series of events centered around five very different girls from five very different backgrounds unfold in a sharehouse named Belle Epoque. Sharing the daily tragedies of their 20s, these girls go through the common yet heartfelt struggles over relationships, dieting culture, part-time jobs and embracing their official step into the world as adults. While it may appear to be a simple youth drama on college girls, once you’re done with season one, you’ll be enticed to continue onto season two. The conversations and pouring emotions unveil a deeper story behind these five ordinary girls who aren’t so ordinary after all. Tears will be shed as you empathize with the small concerns and bigger tragedies these girls share in their growth project that is their 20s.
“Reply 1994”
Let’s go back a bit. Way back to 1994 Korea. Hard to relate? Look into the lives of Generation X college students who gaped at mobile phones and cheered at pixelated television screens. If you’re tired of the rapid industrialization of NFTs and cryptocurrencies, this is a show to watch for the vintage vibes of college life where students gather on lawns to read books and buy magazines to collect paper tokens. It is ideal to go back in time to the millennials when things are going too fast in 2022.

“After Yang” takes the audience to a place that feels both before and after our time.
From powerhouse production company A24, South Korean filmmaker Kogonada’s second feature film, “After Yang,” released on March 4 starring Colin Farrell, Jodie Turner-Smith, Justin H. Min, Malea Emma Tjandrawidjaja and Haley Lu Richardson. Adapted from Alexander Weinstein’s short story, “Saying Goodbye to Yang,” the film may be the best sci-fi flick of the year. 
Written, directed and edited by Kogonada, the film follows Jake (Farrell) and Kyra (Turner-Smith) and their son and human android named Yang, who they bought to help their daughter Mika (Tjandrawidjaja) stay connected to her Chinese ancestry. Touched by themes of adoption, mortality and loneliness, the film also explores artificial intelligence and the concept of man versus machine.
When Yang malfunctions and shuts down, repairing him turns out to be a tedious journey — not as simple as going to a local Best Buy — as it’s revealed that he is a refurbished, secondhand model and the store that he was bought from, Second Siblings, has gone out of business. Although futuristic in the existence of androids that serve as human helpers based on the needs of the family, the film focuses on contemporary concepts of grief, loss and uncertainty, and reflects on what it means to be human. 
The dialogue is littered with cogitating questions such as “What makes someone Asian?” and “Is life the something, followed by the nothing?” One of Kogonada’s strengths is that he highlights the everyday conversation that may seem unnecessary to film, but this paired with deep moments brought on by asking such intrusive questions makes for a dynamic and artistic experience. 
The dance sequence that appears as the credits roll at the beginning is an unexpected element of the film but adds an exciting texture that reels the audience in further, all the way until Mika’s endearing vocal performance at the finale. Moments like these, that add an interesting but fitting texture to the film, are intricately crafted. 
If you’re looking for a sci-fi film filled with fast action scenes and fighter pilots, this one isn’t for you. The pacing is slow, but take the time to sit through the narrative and you’ll be rewarded with what feels like a close whisper of childhood reminiscences, folded into stunning cinematography and a visually engrossing color palette. With the perfect combination of steady, well-framed close-ups to represent modern video calling intertwined with freehand, shaky scenes in the forest, the film promises to give the audiences the space to sit and ponder, similar to many of the characters throughout the film.
While there is CGI involved, it doesn’t feel jarringly separate from the film’s painterly aesthetic. Apart from cinematography, from mixes of organic textures and technology and cool tones with hints of warmth, the production design and costuming both stand out as extremely intricate. Every element of the film has been done with care, and this makes its slower pacing still captivating, rather than boring or monotonous. There could certainly be more chemistry between the cast, but Farrell cements himself as a multifaceted actor as he navigates the grief of losing his son and the loneliness around not being able to fix him or move forward. 
Watch “After Yang,” one of A24’s best films till date, now on Showtime or in theaters. It’s a sublime ode to loss and reclamation, what it means to be Asian, what it means to be human, the transcendence of parenthood and the mysteries of memory and connection.

Many see friendships as a comfort blanket: a shoulder to cry on, a reliable soul to confide in. However, more often than not, we crave discomfort. The atomized nature of our lives causes us to inevitably fall victim to selfishness. We seek individual success, and the people we lose along the way are part of the process. 
We have become too complacent with losing friends. 
The chaos and neverending hustle and bustle that accompanies everyday life is an aggressive obstacle in the pursuit of stable friendships. As students, we use this excuse to shrug off losing people who we once thought to be loved ones. According to The Atlantic writer Jennifer Senior, losing a friend is a “quiet, gray dissolve.” Perhaps it’s not tangible enough to warrant due action, but spending time not talking to an old friend is very different from them leaving your life forever. 
Instead of viewing our lives as a race, where everyone is on their own path to some form of success, we must relearn to value the connections we make along the track. We must reevaluate the harm of radical, individual freedom.
In order to prove that our lives revolve around this race to success, we must define radical individualism. According to Shondaland writer Matthew Miller, this term refers to a social theory “that elevates the freedom of the individual over the collective.” Under the Trump administration, radical individualism plagued many debates, arguing , for instance, that universal healthcare, an example of collectivism, threatened the American Dream. 
However, radical individualism takes a different approach when applied to everyday people. Although pockets of collectivism still exist and thrive, many of us have fallen victim to an individualistic culture. Society tends to celebrate personal achievement and commend it based on the assumption that winning or succeeding is a consequence of working harder than the next person. But how does this relate to our relationships?
As a society, we idolize the concept of “losing friends on the road to success.” I remember being in high school and hearing, “Don’t worry about losing friendships, just focus on school and getting into college. That’s all that will matter in the long run,” a sentiment that is not unique to my experience. It’s plastered on so many books revolving around how to succeed, and it’s embedded in the way we see growth. Motivational speakers will push their audience to be complacent to the inevitable end of losing friends. Spend too much time with friends? You’re losing time better utilized on your achievements. Invest time in your relationships? Invest time in your work instead. 
I’m not here to preach about how this mentality insidiously contributes to our ability to so easily neglect our relationships. However, I do believe it is valuable to reexamine this way of thinking, considering how integral it is to our lives. 
This constant need to succeed —  which stems from our academics, internships, families, professors and counselors — has blinded us from seeing through the whirlwind of change that accompanies our everyday lives. We are expected to tangibly succeed, earn awards, get higher positions, earn better grades. In order to do so, we will lose friends, and that has sadly become normalized. 
When the 9 to 5 is over and done, if we follow this mentality, we are left alone. When all of our tangible achievements become yesterday’s news, we are left with nothing. 
We cannot be complacent with losing friendships because they are our anchors. 
Yes, pursue success. Challenge yourself. Push limits. Test yourself and the people around you. But contrary to all the Forbes articles and all the self-proclaimed success experts, doing it alone does not make you more successful or any better than someone who achieved it with the help of others. 
Put effort into curating healthy relationships, and maintaining them through your busy schedule that seems like it leaves no time for anyone else. Because although we may be living in a society that treasures the independent pursuit of achievement, having people to support and love you on the way is far more important than any end result.

If you’ve read at least one of my articles, you know that I’m not the biggest fan of the e-commerce giant Amazon. From an environmental standpoint, it is terrible. From a labor rights standpoint, Amazon is about the worst you can get employer-wise. It is precisely its blatant disregard for both of those aspects that helped fuel its unprecedented expansion in recent years, and as early as September 2020, Amazon committed to expanding its delivery presence into suburbs and cities. 
In my old stomping grounds of Atlanta, Amazon has moved in with full force. Data from Colliers International finds that there are 22 million square feet in fulfillment center projects under construction in Atlanta, trailing just behind Chicago and Dallas but beating less populated cities like Riverside and Phoenix. If you’re a city leader, you could very well tout this as a means for Atlanta to provide new jobs. But for residents, the prospect of more business coming into the city means more traffic on notoriously congested roads and environmental effects that metro Atlanta’s predominantly Black population would suffer the most under. 
Let’s not forget that Amazon is about as sinister of an employer as they are a nightmare to live around. In the past, Amazon enforced strict productivity goals and invasive monitoring in the workplace. But really, are we surprised? Amazon already knows what its average customer likes to buy or read thanks to its powerful use of technology. Now, it’s using the same monitoring and tracking principles to essentially tell Amazon workers wanting to unionize that they are being watched. Along with timed bathroom breaks and grueling hours, Amazon is clearly not the kind of employer you’d want to work for or the kind of company you want to exist near you. 
Unfortunately, in our Californian neck of the woods, Amazon is starting to breathe down the necks of suburbs and cities in the southern region of the state. Orange County Register writer Jeff Collins wrote that Amazon added 12 new delivery stations in Los Angeles County — 12 not-so-small facilities poking up in ever-growing places like Anaheim, Torrance and Burbank.  
Look, faster delivery isn’t bad at all if it is done under ethical labor and environmental standards. That’s why folks pay more for Priority Mail Express at USPS or overnight shipping at UPS. Folks in those instances pay for a service at a fair price. In the hypothetical case of Amazon v. Workers, however, you’re paying for a burgeoning industry giant to overwork its employees, limit them to meager breaks and leaving them high and dry with little to no substantial benefits — all for a delivery speed that is a mere few days faster than that of Amazon’s competitors. All this to satisfy some fleeting need for material goods that is sure to disappear after the last package comes … right?
Of course, I have no soapbox to stand on when it comes to shaming folks for using Amazon. Whether you’re a busy college student or a working professional with no time to run to brick-and-mortar stores, Amazon is probably the most appealing alternative out there. But I would ask that all of us do something with the time we have while we’re waiting around for packages. 
The one thing slowing down Amazon is the slow process of getting warehouse plans approved in city councils and their respective planning committees. That’s where students come in. Mark your calendars for the next council and planning meetings and sit in on them. You can also review the meeting minutes, keep an ear or an eye out for warehouse projects, call city council folks and simply ask around. 
You’ll almost never find Amazon’s name outright on a development proposal, and it won’t be easy to root them out at first glance. But dedicate an hour every other week or so, and you might just be able to pick up on and stop a future Amazon hub from coming to a city near you.

The USC Rossier School of Education’s Pullias Center for Higher Education and Long Beach City College are collaborating on the Phoenix Scholars program, which aims to support gang-associated youth on their path to obtaining higher education. 
The program expects to welcome its first cohort in the fall and is funded by a $990,000 grant from the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education that extends over three years. LBCC Phoenix Scholars is the only recipient of the United States Department of Education grant. 
“This is a college access and success program for individuals that are 16 to 24 years old that are currently or formerly gang-involved or gang-impacted,” said Adrian Huerta, who works at the USC Pullias Center and will serve as co-principal investigator in the project. “It’s really about making sure that [the youth] have all the chances, support and infrastructure that they need in order to graduate from college.”
Huerta is a national expert on college access for young men of color and gang-associated youth, and will be responsible for creating projects and training faculty and staff of the program to understand how to work with the targeted population. 
Although the grant will be disbursed over a three year period, the hope is that by the end of the period, the project will be self-sustainable, said LBCCD Superintendent-President Mike Muñoz. The grant will allow students to access various resources beyond educational tools, such as success coaches and mental health professionals. 
“What the grant allows us to do is build a comprehensive set of infrastructures and support for gang-associated youth in a way that is sustainable beyond the life of the grant,” Muñoz said.
“Dr. Huerta is an amazing scholar and expert in gang-affiliated youth. We are so pleased for him to receive this important grant and look forward to supporting him in the coming years,” wrote Adrianna Kezar, director of the Pullias Center for Higher Education, in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “We are also excited about the collaboration with Long Beach City College. Our center has long partnered with local schools and colleges to improve the educational experiences in the local area.” 
Two types of challenges are expected: institutional barriers and external barriers, Muñoz said. Students may not feel comfortable disclosing their affiliation with gangs, he said, which would hinder the process of getting them into the program. Additionally, due to negative experiences with educators in the past, they may not feel welcome to access the resources Phoenix Scholars will provide. 
“The other potential barrier that we see is making sure that our college, our offices and support systems are warm and welcoming affirming places for our students,” Muñoz said. “We don’t want the Phoenix Scholars program to be the only safe environment for them. We want to make sure that all of our offices and all our programs are supportive and affirming.”
Additionally, some external barriers students may face are housing insecurity, food insecurity and difficulties finding jobs and getting hired, Muñoz said. The program will also seek to support students in these aspects as part of its holistic approach. Ultimately, the program seeks to empower the students and remove barriers that may prevent their success at college, Muñoz said.
“Many of our young people who have been labeled as gang-affiliated don’t see themselves as college material or feel like they can’t fully access our support services,” Muñoz said. “I’m really excited about the opportunity to, as an institution, be declarative. College is for them and we want to support them. We want them at LBCC and create an environment that really empowers them, liberates them and supports them to ultimately reach their educational goals.”
