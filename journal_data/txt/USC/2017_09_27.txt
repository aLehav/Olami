Undocumented student and ally group IDEAS at USC has pushed for undocumented students to have an official go-to space on campus.
Now, the University is moving toward making that resource a reality.
Last week, the American Studies and Ethnicity Department approved adding  a “pop-up DREAMer Center” in Kaprielian Hall to aid undocumented students. Its name is a reference to the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, which would have given undocumented students who met certain requirements a chance to become permanent residents if it had passed through Congress.
“We knew we wanted an official space that could provide a one-stop shop that can meet all the needs that all the undocumented students have,” said Ana Mercado, one of the IDEAS’ executive chairs.
Mercado said she began to work with her professor George Sanchez from the American Studies department about her idea for a University-wide DREAMers Center, and he agreed to help.
“We had been working with the faculty resistance to get that up and going, but we weren’t getting the type of response that we wanted from them,” Mercado said. “We drafted a proposal of tangible steps that different departments on campus can take to support undocumented students … they didn’t really do much with our proposal.”
Sanchez submitted IDEAS at USC’s proposal to the ASE faculty. At their Monday meeting, the faculty unanimously approved starting a center on their own.
The pop-up DREAMers Center will open on the fourth floor of Kaprielian Hall within the next two weeks, Sanchez said.
It will hold office hours for Vanessa Gomez-Brake, the provost-appointed point of contact for immigration issues, and will allow undocumented students to access information on all the resources the University offers.
Sanchez said he has worked with many undocumented students in the past, but following President Donald Trump’s decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program earlier this month, he has seen the stress of the undocumented population on campus increase.
“It’s really helpful because I know there’s a lot of students here at USC that haven’t come out yet as an undocumented students, so I think it’ll be really cool for them to have a space where they feel comfortable and meet other undocumented students who have already opened up about their status,” said Ana Barrios, a senior majoring in contemporary Latino and Latin American studies and psychology.
Barrios is one of the many USC students studying under the DACA program.
Along with providing resources for undocumented students, Sanchez also hopes to send a message with the opening of the makeshift center.
“Every other campus in California has one, and we think that if the University doesn’t move in that direction, then every department at the University should have one,” Sanchez said. “Everything took enormous amounts of effort. Other universities have moved much more quickly. We just feel like this University moves way too slowly.”
Sanchez said that IDEAS at USC is grateful for what the University has done to support undocumented immigrants, but that they will not “sit around and wait” for more action.
“American Studies and Ethnicity has a long-standing commitment to the inclusion of all students and faculty of all backgrounds,” Sanchez said. “We think this is a vital issue that starts at the heart of whether all students are an equal part of the Trojan Family.”

Athletic Director Lynn Swann addressed the arrest of USC men’s basketball associate head coach Tony Bland and the future of USC during a talk at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Wednesday night.
Bland was arrested as part of a corruption ring along with three other NCAA assistant basketball coaches, according to federal papers that were released to the public on Tuesday. The ring allegedly used bribes to connect top college basketball athletes with financial advisers.
Swann made clear that there was not much information he could share regarding the corruption ring, as the investigation was still ongoing. He explained that USC Athletics was working closely with the USC Office of Compliance, and that the University would cooperate in full with the investigation.
“The fact that this is a federal investigation and not instigated by the NCAA is part of the reason it’s receiving so much attention,” Swann said. “Just because there was a press conference doesn’t mean that the investigation is over.”
He said that USC is launching an internal investigation in addition to those being conducted by the federal government and the NCAA.
“USC is extremely disappointed in having an assistant coach involved with the scandal,” Swann said.
Swann emphasized the need to be proactive and take steps to ensure that students and faculty have a plan to help them make good decisions.
“Where there’s smoke, there’s fire and I will act when I smell smoke,” Swann said. “I’m not interested in waiting until there’s a fire. Had we had any indication that something was wrong in any of our departments, we would have taken action sooner.”
Swann also commented on political topics, such as the recent controversy over whether it’s disrespectful for athletes to protest social justice issues by taking a knee during the national anthem.
“The national anthem only takes so long, you kneel, so what happens after that?” Swann said. “You don’t need to make a hollow gesture to draw attention to something by disrespecting something else.”
Instead, Swann advocated that a true difference can only be made off of the field.
Swann also said he did not believe student athletes should be compensated by their respective colleges — another controversial topic that has come up in recent years.
“They are compensated in the form of a scholarship,” Swann said. “Plus, only one percent of athletes actually have a shot at making it.”
 
USC better self impose penalties including loss of scholarships and sanctions against the head coach.

Research is a key component of undergraduate study at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, providing students with hands-on experience and practical application of skills useful for their future careers. Madeleine Combs and Prajwal Bharadwaj are both taking advantage of research opportunities this year, as they are two of the only three undergraduate biomedical engineering students selected to present research at the 2017 Biomedical Engineering Society Annual Meeting.
The conference will showcase a wide array of findings within the medical device field.
Although Combs and Bharadwaj are both in the same field of study, the focus of their research differs greatly.
Combs, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering with an emphasis in mechanical engineering, conducted research on the immune response testing of micro neuroprobes in the brains of rats to find information that could potentially be applied to humans. Combs worked in the USC Biomedical Microsystems Lab under the guidance of Ellis Meng.
“[Research is] one of the reasons why I wanted to go to USC,” Combs said. “I knew undergrads [could] get involved in research here, which is what makes USC unique.”
By working alongside doctorate student Ahuva Weltman, Combs conducted research for a project titled “Immunohistological Image Analysis of Microprobe Array Targeting Hippocampus.”
“The hippocampus is the part of the brain that is responsible for long-term memory,” Combs said. “So, that’s important for patients with Alzheimer’s or any kinds of illnesses that affect memory. If you’re in a car accident and you have some kind of damage to your hippocampus, those could be very important for that kind of information.”
In her work, Combs focuses on gauging the biocompatibility of the neuroprobe to the rat’s system and its overall responsiveness.
Initially, Combs planned on solely attending the conference with her peers from the Associate Students of Biomedical Engineering, but the organization encouraged her to submit her research as well.
“I’m looking forward to experiencing all the other types of research [at BMES], learning from other [undergraduate] students and also the doctorate students,” Combs said.
Similarly, Bharadwaj, a junior studying biomedical engineering with an electrical engineering emphasis, sought out research opportunities early on in his undergraduate career.
As a freshman, Bharadwaj joined Eun Ji Chung’s lab, which focuses on molecular design, nanomedicine and tissue engineering to generate biomaterial strategies and address the limitations of clinical solutions, according to the Chung Laboratory website.
Bharadwaj’s research, titled “In Vitro Vascular Model for Atherosclerosis,” aims to create a more accurate model of the disease to improve current treatment. Atherosclerosis is a common condition caused by plaque buildup in the arteries, which can lead to chest pain, heart attacks or strokes.
“I think submitting research and exchanging research [with] other scientists is a great way to increase my presentational skills, as well as [take] critical feedback to understand how my research could have been more effective and what steps I can take in the future to improve,” Bharadwaj said.
Bharadwaj says the conference, his first, is a vital opportunity to learn beyond the classroom and laboratory.
“I’d encourage everyone … to look at options surrounding biomedical research even if you’re not going into academia,” Bharadwaj said. “It’s a great way to gain skills that will be useful in your life.”

Upon its debut, facial recognition was among the iPhone X’s most talked-about features. USC assistant professor of computer science Hao Li was one of the developers who brought this idea to life, as he conducted research on facial motion capture that later contributed to the iPhone X’s animated emoji, or “Animoji,” feature.
Li’s contribution began in 2015 when Apple acquired Faceshift, a tech startup he co-founded in 2011. Faceshift is a facial motion capture software that uses Microsoft Kinect’s depth-sensing technology to capture movements in real time.
“One of the most appealing features [of Faceshift] was markerless facial performance capture,” Li said.
Two seminal components were conducive to the technology behind Animoji: facial tracking using structured-light 3-D scanners and non-rigid registration.
Non-rigid registration is a concept that uses an algorithm to smooth out the deformations in depth scans so it matches the person’s movement as much as possible.
“These two components were sort of key,” Li said. “They evolved to all real-time facial things that we see nowadays — for sure the features on the iPhone X.”
Li joined USC three years ago as an assistant professor to start a research lab. He said a university setting was his best choice for creating something “foreign and long-term” because there was no pressure to turn his research into a product.
Li also prefers working with graduate students because of their passion and energy for getting things done.
Li began researching facial models and markerless performance capture about seven to eight years ago, when he earned his doctorate in computer science in Zurich.
In addition to being a professor, Li is also the director of the Vision and Graphics Lab at the USC Institute of Creative Technologies.
The aim of his early research was to revolutionize traditional motion capture methods that used dots or markers.
“The thing with the face is that if you put dots, you can only get very sparse motion so everything looks very rigid and you can’t get the subtleties of the face,” Li said.
Through Faceshift’s depth-sensing technology with the $100 Kinect, Li demonstrated the accessibility of human digitization.
“That’s something super powerful because what it means is that everyone can generate interesting content,” Li said. “You don’t need an animator.”
“In movies, that has always been the Holy Grail, like ‘How can we create a real-looking visual character?’” Li said. “Anything that advances that is really interesting to me.”
He has used his technology in films such as Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies, Star Trek Into Darkness and Furious 7, where he used facial tracking technology to animate and map Cody Walker’s face onto a digital Paul Walker.
Li is now focused on his tech startup Pinscreen, which aims to change online communication via user-generated and personalized 3-D avatars.
“We are trying to develop an algorithm using [artificial intelligence] and deep learning where we can create a complete copy of a person with just a single reference picture,” Li said.

On Wednesday, USC finished up a short week of practice in preparation for Friday’s game against No. 16 Washington State. The team worked on red-zone efficiency and readied for potentially inclement weather while continuing to deal with a slew of recent injuries.
Bracing for harsh weather
This Friday, USC could see a potentially rainy, windy evening in Pullman, Wash. In order to prepare for that prospect, the team practiced with wet footballs on Wednesday.
“It looks like we may get some rain there in the second half,” head coach Clay Helton said. “We worked [in] some precipitation, which will be the first time for us this season.”
Helton insisted that his team will be able to handle the harsh conditions, despite the lack of experience dealing with rain in sunny Southern California.
“We’ve been fortunate,” Helton said. “Stat of the day is: Since 1923, we’ve only had 16 rain games in the Coliseum, but [I’ve] been here for two of them, in 2010 and 2016. At the end of the day, professionals don’t make excuses; they’re supposed to be the answers.”
Injury Update
As USC grinds through 12 straight games without the reprieve of a bye week, the pileup of injuries always seemed inevitable. A third of the way into the season, after facing four challenging opponents, the accumulation of wear and tear has already become a major factor. The Trojans spent most of their short week trying to get key players healthy and back on the field.
“I don’t think anybody is 100 percent right now after these first four games,” Helton said. “I think we all have bumps and bruises right now at all positions.”
Helton offered several injury updates on the offensive side of the ball. Junior wide receiver Deontay Burnett and freshman receiver/return specialist Velus Jones both came back to practice on Wednesday after dealing with minor injuries, but their fellow pass-catcher redshirt senior Steven Mitchell Jr. remained out with a groin injury suffered against Texas. Mitchell Jr. is the team’s second leading receiver with 223 yards and two touchdowns.
“I watched him run today and he is getting closer,” Helton said. “If it’s not Saturday, it will be next week.”
Helton also offered new information about redshirt sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe, as he’s been out with a hip injury since the season opener against Western Michigan. Tight end is a particularly thin position for the Trojans without Imatorbhebhe and now with the departure of freshman Cary Angeline.
“We’re all hoping that he plays this year,” Helton said. “We’re hoping to forecast for the Notre Dame game week. He’s getting closer but this is an investment that we made. We wanted to get him back 100 percent, and until he’s that way, I’m not going to put him out there.”
Junior Tyler Petite is now by far the most experienced tight end on the depth chart. He turned in his best performance last week against Cal with four catches for 46 yards and a touchdown.
Improving red-zone efficiency 
Currently, the Trojans’ lack of success in the red zone has been one of the team’s biggest crutches. Over the first four games, the team is 73rd in red-zone efficiency, tied with Ball State and Idaho. During this week of practice, USC worked on that specific area of the game.
“The last two weeks, we haven’t been great [in short yardage offense],” Helton said. “Everyone can see that. We worked hard in the red zone today and at finishing drives, because third-down and red-zone efficiency is going to be the key in this game. You’re not going to be able to kick field goals while they’re scoring touchdowns.”

Junior Justin Suh captured his second career collegiate title on Tuesday, as the men’s golf team finished fifth at the Trinity Forest Invitational in Dallas. The Trojans were competing in the second tournament of their fall season after opening with a 12th-place finish at the OFCC/Fighting Illini Invitational last week.
No. 8 USC ended the invitational 14 strokes behind runaway winner No. 10 Florida (-17), but Suh topped the individual leaderboard with a score of 10 under par over three strong rounds. The junior shot over par in just five of 54 total holes, birdieing 14 of them and making par on the rest. He bookended the tournament with 4-under rounds, mixing in a 2-under day in-between.
“My overall golf game felt solid, but what specifically helped me this week was my mental approach,” Suh said. “The work I’ve put in with [team psychologist] Kevin Sverduk showed throughout the highs and lows of the event.”
Suh’s win at Trinity Forest built on his ninth-place finish at the OFCC/Fighting Illini Invitational, and it was his first victory since topping the Western Intercollegiate in April.
Sophomore Kyle Suppa recorded USC’s second-lowest score behind Suh, tying for 20th at 1-over. Suppa’s best day came during his second round, when he tallied four birdies for a 1-under day. Freshman Kaito Onishi was just below his teammate on the leaderboard, tying for 24th at 2-over thanks to 10 birdies spread across three rounds.
Three underclassmen rounded out the rest of the Trojan field in Dallas. Redshirt sophomore Ryan Slater tied for 42nd after shooting 5-over, and sophomore Cheng Jin finished 7-over to tie for 49th. Freshman Owen Calvin-Smith, who was playing in his first collegiate tournament, shot 19-over across three rounds to finish in a tie for 75th.
As a team, USC finished behind Florida, No. 13 Auburn, No. 22 Texas Tech and No. 6 Texas in the final standings. A trip to North Plains, Ore., is up next for the Trojans as they compete in the Nike Collegiate Invitational. The tournament kicks off on Sunday and runs through Tuesday at Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club.

We’ve got to talk about Sam Darnold.
I didn’t want to write this column. Heading into the season, I was basically the conductor of Darnold’s hype train heading on an express route to New York for the Heisman ceremony. I read all of the features from ESPN to Sports Illustrated, and although we’re supposed to adopt a semi-objective stance as sports reporters, I was as Team Darnold as you could get.
Then the Western Michigan game happened. I shrugged it off, swore he’d bounce back and immediately felt vindicated by the 600-plus offensive yards of the Stanford game. But then the Texas game happened, and the Cal game, and I began to worry, then doubt, if those Heisman hopes would come to fruition.
It’s time to face the facts. Darnold doesn’t rank in to the Top 10 of the country in most quarterback statistics. He’s No. 16 in passing yards and No. 21 in passing percentage. He’s thrown only nine touchdowns so far, which ties him for No. 19 in the nation.
The scramble-savvy mobile quarterback isn’t even finding success on the ground. Darnold did rush for a touchdown this year, but he’s taken so many sacks for a loss that his rushing total evens out to a zero. Compare that to his freshman performance: After starting in four games last year, he’d already rushed for 125 yards.
Darnold is, however, near the top of the country in one statistic: interceptions. He’s tossed seven already this year, almost equal with his touchdown total. That’s almost an average of two per game, which leaves Darnold only slightly behind Tanner Lee of Nebraska and Cal’s Ross Bowers, who coughed up four in one game while being absolutely terrorized by the USC secondary last week.
I’m not listing these statistics to beat a dead horse, and I’m not saying that Darnold isn’t talented. He is talented, and he might just be one of the best quarterbacks we’ve ever seen at USC. But he’s young, and he’s prone to mistakes, and he’s still smoothing down some of his edges.
The fact of the matter is that last year, Darnold was a secret weapon that head coach Clay Helton didn’t even realize he had in his back pocket. Defensive coordinators across the country were left scrambling to plan for the threat of a quarterback who could scramble that skillfully, run that quickly and throw that deftly.
But this season, he wasn’t a surprise. Everyone in the country saw him coming. That is, after all, what happens when your face is plastered on the front cover of Sports Illustrated, ESPN The Magazine and every other college sports rag in the country. It’s hard to stay incognito when NFL fans start “#SuckForSam” campaigns in hopes of tanking to earn the No. 1 draft pick to select their new quarterback messiah.
That lack of surprise took away a little bit of Darnold’s edge. One of his greatest skills is throwing into coverage, sometimes tossing to a receiver in double or triple coverage. When it works, it’s a thing of beauty. But when it doesn’t, it’s another interception to add to his statistics.
Darnold is having to find balance this year — when to throw and when not to, how to weight his passes to the inside or outside of a route, which receivers can win 50/50 balls — and it’s showing. Now that corners and safeties are aware of his proclivity for throwing into danger, they’re salivating over all of his longer passes with the hopes of picking off a Heisman candidate. So when Darnold makes a mistake, he pays for it.
I’m not giving up hope for Sam. Not yet, at least.
For better or worse, he’s still quarterbacked the team to a 4-0 start to the season, staying cool in overtime thrillers and last-minute comebacks to keep the team’s record clean. But for Darnold to return to his place on a pedestal, he’ll need to make some changes. A trip to New York might not be in his future. But if Trojan fans are lucky, Darnold’s rocky start will even out to a trip to Atlanta this winter.

The women’s volleyball team opened Pac-12 play with back-to-back wins over UCLA and Oregon State last week, and the No. 20 Women of Troy will look to stay undefeated in-conference this weekend when they host Washington State and No. 6 Washington.
USC upset the Bruins in Westwood to kick off its Pac-12 slate last Wednesday and followed up with a four-set win against Oregon State over the weekend. Senior opposite hitter Brittany Abercrombie and junior libero Victoria Garrick have spearheaded their team during its hot streak, and they were named the Pac-12 Offensive and Defensive Players of the Week, respectively, on Monday. Abercrombie racked up 18 kills apiece against the Bruins and Beavers (she is also second on the team with 31 blocks), and Garrick led the squad with 18 digs versus UCLA and 25 against Oregon State.
Now the Women of Troy look forward to a tough weekend challenge, as they face two conference rivals on consecutive days. Washington State is up first on Saturday: The Cougars are unranked, but they boast an impressive 12-2 overall record and are coming off their first conference win of the season against Arizona. They are also undefeated (7-0) on the road so far and will look to keep their perfect mark intact at the Galen Center. However, USC will also be eager to exact revenge on its home court after falling to Washington State 3-2 last season.
After taking on the Cougars, the Women of Troy’s bigger challenge will likely come on Sunday. Washington is likewise unbeaten away from home this season (4-0) and sports a 12-1 overall record. The team’s lone loss, however, came against Creighton — a team that USC swept 3-0 in September. The Huskies left Los Angeles with a 3-0 victory last year, and the Trojans will hope for a better showing in 2017.
USC will once again lean on Abercrombie and Garrick as well as sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier, the team’s main offensive threat. But head coach Mick Haley will also look for key contributions from players such as junior middle blocker Brittany Welsh, who — true to her position — currently leads the team with 34 blocks in her first season in Cardinal and Gold after transferring from LSU.
Lanier has racked up 208 kills this fall and leads the team by a large margin, but outside hitters Abercrombie, junior Alyse Ford and senior Niki Withers have all tallied more than 100 kills. Senior setter Reni Meyer-Whalley and sophomore setter Cindy Marina have also been creative forces for the Women of Troy, combining for nearly 600 assists so far.
USC will hope its well-rounded team play makes the difference this year against both Washington schools. First serve against Washington is scheduled for 1 p.m. on Saturday in the team’s first game of the weekend doubleheader.
Washington St. will go down in 4, but it will take 5 to beat Washington. Good luck ladies.

Grace Cillo | Daily Trojan
Scout Schultz, a 21-year-old LGBTQ engineering student at Georgia Tech, called campus security on the evening of Sept. 16 to report a suspicious person. Campus police took immediate action and apprehended the knife-wielding suspect, who, visibly distressed and angry, continued to approach the officers despite their warnings until he was shot dead. The victim was later identified as Scout Schultz, who left three suicide notes in their dorm before leaving for their fatal encounter.
Shultz’s death was more than a tragedy — it was an unheeded, desperate cry for help, and it brings into question whether on-campus mental health resources are doing enough to help eradicate the stigma of mental illness that is the single biggest barrier preventing those afflicted from seeking the support they need. USC boasts a variety of facilities devoted to the mental wellness of students, from the Engemann Student Health Center to the USC Medical Center Psychiatric Clinic, both of which provide assessments covered by student health insurance. However, despite the effective services these facilities offer, the American Psychological Association finds that the majority of college students with a diagnosable mental illness do not reach out for help, and it is time to understand why.
According to their annual survey for the Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors, the nationwide increase in university enrollment in recent years has been coupled by an increase in the prevalence and severity of mental illness that students experience. On the other hand, the proportion of students willing to ask for help — around one in every three afflicted — has remained stagnant. It will stay that way, too, if focus is not shifted from providing treatment to providing a safe platform for individuals who seek it.
Where mental health is concerned, dialogue can be a powerful tool as well as a weapon. Unfortunately, mental illness is still quietly but heavily stigmatized, and the devil is in the details. The trivialization and mockery of mental health’s nuances are just one potential factor that discourages students from getting help. Few would ever dream of disparaging anyone’s color, sexual orientation or economic status, yet feel free to trivialize mental illness in their conversations, by throwing around the terms “bipolar” or “depressed” with impunity. “I have the worst anxiety right now,” says a student who procrastinated and let his or her work pile up. “I’m so triggered,” says another after hearing a joke.
These comments might feel inoffensive, but they devalue the psychological conditions underlying these terms and paint mental illness as a mindset that can be entered and escaped rather than a neurobiological imbalance. By allowing words like “depression” and “anxiety” to be integrated into our everyday conversations, they can lose their meaning. They become descriptions and convenient terms and are rejected as serious afflictions.
In turn, those actually suffering from mental illness can have a more difficult time identifying what they are going through. Furthermore, they are often embarrassed to speak out because of the misconstrued image conjured by using mental health terms in casual language. Students must be mindful, because the way they talk about mental illness colors the way they and those around them think about it. Words alone have the ability to influence someone’s decision to speak out, and to make or break the connection between medical help and those who desperately need it. Reducing mental illness to a joke tells those suffering that their pain is not valid, that it is not real, and that is no better than discriminating against someone for their color or sexual orientation — a part of themselves they cannot control.
According to the Center of Collegiate Mental Health’s annual report from 2016, the rate of demand for counseling services outpaced that of enrollment growth by five times. There is high demand for  mental health services even in spite of relatively low reporting rates. The problem appears to be two-pronged: A plurality of students are actively choosing not to seek these resources out, but services for these two-thirds of students seeking help are already limited.
There is a piece of the puzzle missing. High-quality facilities are necessary, but they are also futile if only a fraction of the mentally ill are benefitting. Behavioral social scientist Lisa Sontag spoke to NBC about how the events of Sept. 16 that left Shultz dead should bring to light the necessity of providing training not only for police and professionals who deal with emergencies, but also for faculty, staff and students, so they have the tools to recognize those in distress and can help before it is too late. Understanding mental illness is the first step to fighting it, but it is not enough: If students can adjust their attitudes so that those afflicted feel comfortable speaking up, more mentally ill students may get the medical support they need, and far fewer cries for help, like that of Scout Shultz, would go unheard. Then — and only then — can the potential of the University’s new facilities and resources be maximized.
In their final moments, Shultz stopped trying to hide they pain because they could not hide it anymore, because they should not have ever had to and because they never felt comfortable seeking help on the campus that was supposed to be their home. In light of their death, it is imperative that universities take a step back and consider if they have created safe and mindful environments for mental health discourse. Students in need must, at the very least, be able to count on their peers to understand what they are going through and ensure they know their options.

Growing up, I was taught to listen to others and never speak out of turn. Contrary to what you might think, this had far more to do with my gender than my ethnicity. Across race and culture, women are taught from a young age to hold their tongues and defer to the opinions and ideas of men — men who are disproportionately placed in positions with decision-making power and disproportionately given airtime, opportunities and platforms to influence the public.
For years, I resented my habit of deference to others — typically males — in conversation, apologizing for my rare interjections and qualifying my every statement with the words, “This is just my opinion, but…” But while the ingrained lessons of my upbringing may have stalled my ability to find my voice as a writer and activist, to an extent, watching the events of the past week unfold have led me to see that there is some advantage in being taught to listen to others and think before I speak. That’s not to say that I condone the sexist forces that instill these instincts in young women and not young men, but rather, that it’s high time for men to learn these same lessons.
Last week, President Donald Trump’s remarks about North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un at a United Nations conference — mockingly calling the dictator “Rocket Man” and threatening to destroy North Korea, without blinking an eye — alarmed a number of experts and world leaders. Kim is notorious for his fragile ego, which is precisely why the CIA has warned against directing petty insults toward him. Subsequently, North Korea’s leader identified Trump’s words as a declaration of war, but failing to realize the gravity of the situation — or perhaps encouraged by it — Trump has only continued to mock Kim on Twitter.
In this particular case, the potential consequences are limitless and terrifying — nuclear war, the destruction of the civilized world, all as a result of 140 characters and two deeply sensitive and fragile men at the helm of it all. But the current conflict between the United States and North Korea is, in many ways, just a high-stakes manifestation of what our culture teaches young men — to not tolerate slights and disrespect, to be “alpha” and dominate those who threaten them, to protect their land, property and family.
No wonder 53 percent of men voted to “make America great again” at a time when women are starting to edge out men as household breadwinners. And no wonder conservatives in all their golden traditionalism call men they perceive as weak “cucks” — men who are cheated on by their wives or, in other words, men who are unable to adequately control their property.
Trump and Kim’s behaviors reflect a textbook case of toxic masculinity run amok. But given their positions and nuclear arsenals, it’s a case that could yield so much more than a schoolyard fight — one that could tragically affect millions, and one that the majority of American voters tried to stop.

There’s a lot to be said about the violence inherently attached to collective patriarchal understandings of masculinity. Teaching young men that any of their distasteful actions can be dismissed with the simple, blasé utterance, “boys will be boys” — all while glorifying heterosexual men’s purportedly bestial sexual appetites in media and Trump-esque “locker-room talk” — have constructed a rape culture that may never be dismantled. And in the same vein, a separate column altogether could be dedicated to the roles of patriarchy and masculinity in constructing male obsession with firearms — an obsession that results in thousands of homicides, domestic abuse cases and accidental deaths annually.
But America’s overarching struggles with toxic masculinity are not only apparent in militaristic conflicts or violent crime rates. This weekend, the president’s appalling sparring with black athletes in the NFL and NBA — who were either protesting America’s indisputable problems with structural racism and police brutality, or the Trump administration’s glorification of said structural racism and police brutality — emphasized the great and gendered privilege of being able to shout nonsense without listening to others.
The president is dead-set on the idea that NFL protests during the national anthem have “nothing to do with race,” as he wrote in one tweet, and that players who have adopted the practice of kneeling during the anthem are declaring their hatred of America. He has tuned out players’ endless explanations of how this protest actually demonstrates their patriotism — the protest during the anthem is a fight to make America a better, safer place for everyone. Trump ignores any commentators who point out the hypocrisy of his adoration for Confederate paraphernalia — symbols of a regime that seceded from and splintered the Union — and continues to yell.
It’s shocking and appalling, but in a country of patriarchal politics, it’s nothing new. In 2016, 60 percent of people commenting about reproductive rights on cable television were men, and that 64 percent of comments about reproductive rights on cable television were inaccurate should speak a lot about whether or not men are listening to anyone but themselves. And all in the realm of men doing the vast majority of talking and decision-making on women’s issues while simultaneously tuning out actual women and experts, how many times will activists have to iterate that Planned Parenthood can’t use federal funding for abortion services before this finally gets through Republican lawmakers’ skulls? (That wasn’t a rhetorical question — at this point, I really do want to know.)
In recent years, feminists have responded to this ingrained culture of inequality by encouraging and empowering women to speak up and get what’s theirs, to cut off “mansplainers” and refuse to be interrupted. And that’s important. But it’s not just women we should demand change from — it’s also men. Humility and the ability to listen and learn from others before talking aren’t just deeply important life skills. In today’s political climate, these skills could also stop the world from nuclear destruction.

Has anyone else noticed that most of the self-appointed experts on men and masculinity are women?
You’re rambling, again.  
By the by, I would bet that your comment; “my habit of deference to others — is contrived to fit your narrative. 
You touch upon – and only touch – every social topic that is currently on the Left Menu.  
Admit it, you are a man-hater based on nothing. How does it feel to be another female lemming?  Does your father know that he is a “toxic male”?
Please do yourself and the rest of us a big favor by selecting one of the multiple catch phrases  and descriptors in your diatribe and truly expand on it.  As it stands, it is evident that this article was written in haste to meet a deadline.

This Thursday night, Ford Amphitheatre in Hollywood will be buzzing with a different kind of energy. The ever-reclusive Allan Rayman will bring his brooding catalogue to the outdoor venue, giving audience members what will likely be their first glimpse into the man behind the music.
Type “Allan Rayman interview” into your Google search bar, and you’ll be hard-pressed to find any relevant results outside of a conversation with Billboard preceding his newest album, Roadhouse 01. “Interview, interview, interview, please / They wanna know about me / What you wanna know about?” he growls on “Shelby Moves,” telling the world what he’s told countless storytellers who have sought access into his personal life. Instead, he prefers to let his music speak for him, focusing on topics such as love and death from his hermitic perspective.
It’s a lost cause trying to pin Rayman’s style into any particular genre, as is the case with many modern-day artists. Blending R&B, rock and hip-hop influences among several other genres, he has created his own signature sound that resonates with listeners for its distinctiveness. Lyrically, Rayman’s deeply personal lines strike a chord as well, with his gravelly voice adding to the emotion he puts into every song. He finds peace in solitude, describing his outlook on life on somber songs like “Tennessee,” which express a desire to reject  society in favor of a simpler life.
Searching for the solitude he sings about, the Toronto-based artist packed his bags and headed for Lost Springs, Wyo., a ghost town boasting a population of four, according to the 2010 U.S. Census. He saw a complete retreat from society as the best way to prioritize his music in the absence of everything else. Despite his non-existent social media presence, he has grown a loyal following thanks to his dedicated team and music.
It’s easy to find the parallels between his actual life and his music videos, with the small screen treatment driving home the narrative he puts forth in his music even further. Rayman’s music videos tell a story as well, giving life to songs with carefully thought-out cinematography. His two-part film “Verona’s Obsession” combines multiple songs from Roadhouse 01, seeing him eventually run off into the woods to take shelter in a cabin after a brief affair with an unnamed woman.
If Rayman’s previous shows are any indication, that element of mystery will still be on display at the Ford Amphitheatre this Thursday. He’s known to have little to no crowd engagement while he’s on stage, diving straight into the music when he walks out and saying little between songs. The ever-present fourth wall might make it more challenging for audience members to truly understand the singer while he’s in their presence, but that only adds to the gravity of the art on display. Not everyone is wired for the microscopic and often unwarranted attention that comes with being a successful musician, but that doesn’t make Rayman’s work any less compelling.

If you haven’t yet heard of Los Angeles-based cosmic psych-pop duo HOTT MT, give them a listen. HOTT MT was formed in 2012, consisting of singer-bassist Ashi Dala and singer-guitarist Nick “Spooki” Tavi. HOTT MT is an acronym for Hour Of The Time Majesty Twelve, named after a radio show by conspiracy theorist and UFO expert William Cooper, which takes cosmic dream pop to a whole new level.
With frontwoman Dala’s whispery vocals and ethereal lyrics, HOTT MT’s signature sound is celestial dream pop. The group released its second full-length record, AU, which stands for “alternate universe” — an apt title for an album describing two worlds and everything in between.
The album was inspired by Michael Ende’s 1979 novel The Neverending Story, a fairy tale adventure about a boy who travels to a magical land ruled by a childlike empress, as explained by Dala on the duo’s YouTube series, “Now You Know The Lyrics.” True to its literary inspiration, the album feels cosmic and spiritual.

A few standout songs on the album are “At Night in Chinatown,” “Queen of Shapes” and “Ivory Tower.” AU is about transitioning between places — it’s about the in-between and the power of change. This is especially powerful coming from a band that was displaced from its home in Chinatown, and whose members ended up living in their cars at one point.
On the HOTT MT Bandcamp page, the band describes its personal sound as, “Taking you to a magical place and leaving you there since 2012,” which sums up their ethos of using music to transport listeners to another world. The duo describes itself as “Thai gaze,” as evidenced by its choice of tags on Bandcamp.
Some of the songs definitely channel a sound reminiscent of East Asia, especially in the beginning of the song “Tournament I,” which makes the group different from a lot of other psych bands in Los Angeles. The pair’s sophomore album includes spoken word stories about lightning strikes from friends getting drunk after graduating high school, a cover of Sesame Street’s “Alphaquest” theme song and many mentions of emperors and warriors, making the album feel very whimsical and story-like, yet simultaneously wise and mature.
HOTT MT will perform at Desert Daze in Joshua Tree National Park on Oct. 13 and again a week later at The Echo in Los Angeles on Oct. 30.

Each concert-goer entering the Carson Center is different from the one before. A female student athlete, well over 6 feet tall, places her backpack next to an older, gray-haired couple who turn to smile and greet her. The crowd is mixed with students, adults and alumni, each representing facets of the larger USC community. As the performers take their places and the audience members store away their smartphones, suddenly these differences don’t seem so apparent. Everyone in the audience eagerly awaits the start of the show, a performance put on by the USC Thornton Concert Jazz Orchestra.
At the helm is Jason Goldman, an acclaimed producer and arranger at the USC Thornton School of Music. Goldman has previously worked with industry giants such as Michael Bublé. Currently, he teaches large ensembles as well as private instructional courses within the jazz department.
“I’ve really challenged this ensemble with a different task,” Goldman said. “I’ve asked them each to deconstruct the classical tunes of the ’20s and ’30s, adding a contemporary spin,” Goldman said.
Goldman opened the night with a lighthearted joke, asking the crowd, “Do I look like Elvis?” The short-statured man went on to share that the old swing tunes of the night were all student and graduate pieces, further highlighting Thornton’s talent.
Opening with a rendition of Count Basie’s “One O’Clock Jump,” the 18-person ensemble delighted the crowd with a vibrant tune. Each member, intently reading the music sheets propped on stands before them, cracked smiles in between playing their respective instruments.
“The set-up of tonight’s show is truly a reimagining of classical swing dance,” said Jordan Wainright, a senior majoring in trombone at Thornton. “Each piece is danceable, lighthearted and fun to perform.”
Wainright and her fellow performers have spent four weeks preparing for this concert. The senior said she enjoys being a part of this niche in the USC community because it “welcomes students of various musical backgrounds.” She has been able to meet other musicians who inspire and introduce her to new sounds and opportunities within the industry.
While jazz music may seem niche, Wainright says the ensemble even has an aerospace engineering major. In addition to a variety of majors, the ensemble encourages students of all musical levels to audition. The only criteria to join are the ability to stay on tempo and solid improv skills.
Wainright believes that the camaraderie shared between performers is what makes the group unique. Reflecting on her time at USC, Wainright said that some of her favorite memories have been performing with the jazz ensemble for audience members in Ground Zero. While the Ground Zero performances are on a brief hiatus as the space undergoes renovations, the ensemble is pleased with the Carson Center’s ambiance and arrangement.
The USC Thornton Concert Jazz Orchestra hosts a number of free concerts throughout the year, providing musicians with platforms to express their love of jazz for an audience eager to meander back in musical history.

Marvel Studios president and USC alumnus Kevin Feige has endowed a fund through the USC School of Cinematic Arts to create a space for filmmaker students to make their ideas a reality.
USC School of Cinematic Arts Dean Elizabeth Daley said that Feige’s gift to his alma mater will have an impact on students who aspire to become filmmakers and producers.
“I can’t tell you how much this fund means to our students,” Daley told USC News. “Kevin’s done so much for this school and his gift will make sure that the art of creative producing, which Kevin has mastered like no other, will be taught to students in a way that honors his legacy.”
Since graduating in 1995, Feige has been a presence in the entertainment industry, often speaking to students at screenings for his blockbuster films. Feige applied to the School of Cinematic Arts six times but was rejected the first five, according to the Financial Times.
Feige worked on films such as Volcano and You’ve Got Mail before becoming the president of production for Marvel Studios in 2007. Feige has produced films like X-Men and The Avengers, which have a combined worldwide box office gross of $12 billion, according to USC News.
In 2014, Feige received the Mary Pickford Alumni Award from SCA, which is given to those who have reached high recognition in the entertainment industry.

The women’s soccer team started conference play with a draw against Utah last Saturday.
The Trojans played well on both sides of the field, with freshman midfielder Savannah DeMelo leading the offense with six shots, four of which were on target. Furthermore, redshirt freshman goalkeeper Kaylie Collins recorded her second shutout of the season — the first came in a 2-0 victory over Missouri. Despite USC’s efforts, the match ended in a double overtime draw — and the Trojans’ record fell to 6-1-1.
Looking forward, the No. 10 Trojans will return to McAlister Field to challenge Pac-12 competitors Oregon State and Oregon on Thursday and Sunday.
The Beavers are sitting on a three-game losing streak and a 3-4-2 overall record. Their last win was a 1-0 overtime affair on Sept. 8 against Portland State. OSU will face its first top-25 opponent this season in USC.
Oregon State started Pac-12 play last Friday against Arizona State. Although the Beavers lost 2-1, there are a couple of things the Trojans can learn from looking at the match.
First, the Sun Devils placed 10 shots on net, eight of which were saved by junior goalkeeper Bella Geist. If the Women of Troy want to be successful against a goalkeeper of this caliber, they need to create opportunities and place shots on net. In the first few games of the season, the Trojans struggled with that objective, but have found success in recent matches.
Second, the Trojans should be aware of senior forward Emma Jones. Jones has routinely recorded a significant amount of shots on net. However, the Beavers have only tallied five goals this season. The Trojans’ defense will find success if they limit scoring opportunities from the already-struggling Oregon State offense.

After a long weekend at home, the men’s water polo team looks to shake off its first defeat of the season as it hits the road for three games this weekend. While the Trojans finished in second place at the tournament, their games leading up to the championship came down to the wire. Even with their successes, they know they must keep working if they want to get back to winning.
“I think we started most of the games pretty well,” senior driver Blake Edwards said. “We just fell apart in the second and third quarter and put ourselves in the situation where we had to come back from behind. The biggest thing was probably just our defense. Last season, our defense was the best aspect of our game, and this tournament we really let ourselves down in that area. We just need to get on the same level and get that cohesion back.”
With a focus on improved defense for this weekend’s games, they are looking to use these games to put the changes they have made into effect. More than anything, they are looking to keep improving their game so that they are prepared for when it comes down to the finals at the end of their season. That being said, the players are more concerned with what they are doing this weekend than what their opponents are doing.
“I think the most important thing is that we just address our own issues and weakness,” Edwards said. “And, that we work really hard this week, watch the film, study ourselves, worry about playing our own game. Ultimately, [it’s] getting our defense back.”
Not only will the Trojans be playing their first game since losing to UCLA, but they also will play away for the first time since the Aggie Roundup two weekends ago. Even though they have had the luxury of having home pool for such a long period, the Trojans are ready to embrace the positives that away games offer.
“It is always much better and much more comfortable playing at home with the support of your own crowd,” Edwards said. “But we also like road trips as well. Playing away, it’s always good to stay together and spend a bit more time discussing and hanging out with your team.”
The Trojans’ first game this weekend will also be the first of the short Lancer Invitational. They face Cal Baptist and then Fresno Pacific right after on Friday. Then, they will head to Malibu in order to take on Pepperdine. However, they have a routine that will keep them preparing for each game the same. The younger members of the team may need guidance to do, but the older members of the team are ready to teach them the ropes.
“Preparation and routine should stay the same every game, no matter who the opponent is,” Edwards said. “For the senior guys, we have been doing the same thing every year, so it is just about us passing on how we prepare for games to the younger guys.”

There are two great sins against the American experiment in my book. The first is routinely committed by President Donald Trump.
It is not the “betrayal of American ideals” so many on the left routinely accuse the president of committing. Rather, it’s the distortion of American patriotism Trump displays whenever he’s talking to an organization premised on public service and American citizenship.
It happened when the president made an embarrassingly self-serving and pretentious speech to employees of the Central Intelligence Agency, in front of the CIA’s Wall of Heroes. It happened when the president used his speech to the Boy Scouts of America to boast about his margin of victory in the Electoral College and complain about the disloyalty of his colleagues in government. It’s probably happened when the president has spoken to other similarly civically oriented communities. He makes patriotism a thing of flags and eagles, dumbing it down into a high school fight song. The real virtues of patriotism — duty, sacrifice, honor, service, love, that so many service members live every day — go unmentioned.
The second great sin against the American experiment is more fashionable these days. It’s the identification of American patriotism with such habits as racism, xenophobia, lack of sophistication and general backwardness. In particular, it is the placing of “patriotism” and “social justice” at opposite sides of a spectrum, and unequivocally endorsing social justice and condemning patriotism (even while finagling the definitions of these terms through enough loopholes to suggest that disrespecting the American flag in public is somehow an act of patriotism in itself.)
This is what the NFL has found itself endorsing on national television over the last week, as players and managers and owners have repeatedly emulated Colin Kaepernick and taken a knee during the national anthem. Trump’s attacks put them in a hard place and gave them a hard choice, it’s true — but they still made the choice. And American public opinion has been polarized over that choice. It’s a sad day when patriotism gets turned into a quasi-partisan question, but for better or for worse, Trump and Kaepernick have turned it into that, and we’re witnessing the results now.
There are a lot of people who love this country, who appreciate its heritage and respect its flag, but who are appalled by the unprofessional and divisive bluster of Trump, who are put in an awkward position by the aforementioned dichotomy. On the one hand, there’s a mainstream left that has abandoned any pretense of practicing or respecting those who practice American civic nationhood. On the other hand, you have a mainstream right that actively cultivates an intolerant political and rhetorical strategy.
I think most average Americans hold their noses and side with the Republican flag-wrappers.  They’d much rather cast their lots with a conservative media elite and a rabidly chauvinist president who at the very least pretend believe that “America” is worth loving, than with a society of journalists, academics and celebrities who disparage patriotism as the last refuge of scoundrels and the first cover of racists.
That’s a really sad choice to make: Trump’s fake patriotism, or Kaepernick’s rejection of patriotism. But is it really that hard to see why so many people have made it?
Trump and his supporters are on one side of the coin, and Kaepernick and his supporters are on the other. Neither understands what patriotism is. Neither would care to practice it or respect it if they did; Trump’s ego gets in the way, as does Kaepernick’s conscience. Ego and conscience are things we postmodernists love; maybe that’s why the old-fashioned virtues of honor, duty and service to country go unsung these days.
If the USC Trojans start taking a knee while the Trojan Marching Band plays the national anthem, we’ll deserve the withholding of our federal funds. We’ll deserve it if the good men and women who carry Old Glory onto the field every Saturday, future officers in the United States Armed Forces and sworn defenders of the American project, choose to boycott players who don’t appreciate their service. If Kaepernickism comes to the Coliseum, I’ll forever be ashamed to be a Trojan. But I’ll never, ever be ashamed to be an American.

Taking a knee in football used to be a quarterback’s uncontroversial, but vital play. But following President Donald Trump’s tweet that NFL players who kneeled during the national anthem should be fired, the move has become American football’s choice method of protest and a hotbed of debate. 
Some have lamented the politicization of the NFL following this move. They have suggested that somehow, sports should be an all-American activity, above the political fray, that everyone should be able to enjoy. What they fail to realize is that sports is, and has always been, political. Athletes have made huge donations to political campaigns; the ownership of football teams is a political process; former athletes have run for political office. To extricate politics from sports is to remove an institution from its social context  — it’s illogical and unproductive.
On a university campus, sports and politics are still intertwined. College football players have been embroiled in controversy about whether they should be paid, the special accommodations they receive and the challenges of student-athlete life. The fact that many college football players — Sam Darnold, for example — become representatives of the universities they play for makes their existence political.
So if a USC football player wants to take a knee, then they should be appoftelauded for it — for risking embroiling themselves in controversy in order to garner attention for the police brutality crises affecting our communities of color. Kneeling is not unpatriotic; in fact, the opposite is true. 
The United States was built on protest, both literal and figurative. Colonialists protested British rule, often in the streets — the Boston Tea Party, anyone? Protest is an American tradition. NFL athletes protesting by kneeling did so in the spirit of American values — life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness — not despite them. They recognize that the political ideals America stands for are fundamentally incompatible with the violence facing black and brown communities. That statement should be uncontroversial, and yet it is not. 
It’s curious that so many critics of Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid think that an NFL game was an inappropriate venue to protest. Daily Show host Trevor Noah hit back at that idea with an exasperated question in his show this week: “When is it the right time for black people to protest?” Protest is most effective when it is least expected. It is supposed to startle, galvanize and energize. Nowhere is a better place for this than on national television, especially with the blessing of the organization that a player represents.
The support that the NFL has shown its players is remarkable. The NFL’s statement is an excellent example of organizational leadership in the face of political — and very public — controversy. DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the National Football League Players Association, understood that to stand by his players, he could not avoid politics. He tweeted on Saturday: “We will never back down. We no longer can afford to stick to sports.” 
Luckily, it looks like colleges are supporting their students’ right to protest. At a NCAA meeting in January discussing activism in athletics, officials largely agreed that student-atheletes’ speech should not be suppressed.
“From the Vietnam War to the present, student-athletes have felt compelled to use their platform to express opinions about social issues,” Lincoln University President Kevin Rome said during a panel discussion. “Whether by wearing black armbands or kneeling during the national anthem, student-athletes should not lose their constitutional rights.”
Rome makes an important point: USC football players are students, too. If USC wants to encourage their students to engage in discourse, then it should applaud the efforts of students to use the University as a platform to participate in productive national conversations. That’s what it means to be a Trojan — to be courageous enough to stand up for what is right.

Even if the “protest” is before the anthem, I still don’t want to see it.  And how does kneeling for a few seconds do anything to really help others?  How are they measuring the results?  Why not go into the community and help.  On my resume, under volunteer work, if I put that I take a knee, I’d get laughed out of the interview.  How difficult is it to rest for a few seconds?  How much sweat equity did it take?  Or how much sacrifice versus someone who’s out on a weekend helping build homes with Habitat for Humanity?  Or raising awareness and funds for cancer research.
Just like it’s their right to “protest,” it’s my right to change the channel and delete my NFL app.  And thanks for saving me from watching that last Chargers game, haha!  I would have watched that misery if it weren’t for the ridiculousness of the Million Dollar Millennials with their oh so difficult protest.
“Recognize the patriotism?” No. They could speak out at various occasions, as is their right. But to disrespect their country’s national anthem? That is disgusting, loathesome, and shows contempt for those of us who are patriots, and who do love our country.
Those protesting players may easily earn $7 million a year, and are adored, lionized and treated like kings. Oh, yes, they have SO much to protest!
Obviously everyone has forgotten what entertainment is…For me it’s to get away from the world problems for a few hours with family and friends.  Enjoy a movie, listen to great music  support my favorite teams and players. The moment they decide to protest publicly,. speak out in the media their political views or disrespect America. I get to stop paying to see live Pro games,movies,concerts etc… I get to stop purchasing memorabilia. I get to stop purchasing the newspaper. I get to turn the TV off. Fight On✌️
Absolutely!! No NFL in this house. ✌️✌️

The Voice held an early screening on Friday as the  Emmy Award-winning reality singing competition gears up for its 13th season since its debut in 2011.
Without revealing spoilers, viewers can expect one intriguing narrative this season. Jennifer Hudson’s addition to the show as a coach cannot be overstated. Hudson is dynamic; her abundance of experience, wit and humor explodes on screen. While returning judges Adam Levine, Blake Shelton and Miley Cyrus could be considered “veteran” coaches, Hudson is no rookie. Her background as a contestant on American Idol and as a coach on The Voice UK is unique and will give her an edge this season.
In a Q&A hosted by Season 12 winner Chris Blue and executive producer Audrey Morrissey, Morrissey praised Hudson’s expertise and value as a coach due to her experience as a contestant. 
“[Jennifer] is, as you’ve seen, a force to be reckoned with,” Morrissey said. “She goes toe-to-toe with absolutely everybody. She has that extra special knowing, of knowing what they’re feeling, knowing what they’re going through, and I can tell you that carries on through the season.”
Morrissey then expressed her belief that Hudson, despite her tremendous appeal, would not disrupt the balance of teams, pointing out that The Voice has managed to maintain its competitiveness for 12 seasons thus far. However, she did admit that contestants with auditions in the later days of recording are at a disadvantage with fewer spots available on each team.
Morrissey pointed to Blue as evidence of this difficulty, as Alicia Keys chose him to fill the last spot available on any of the four teams. Blue said watching the number of contestants decrease from day to day was difficult, but he remained calm the day of his audition with a shift in perspective.
“I said to myself, ‘If it’s meant to be, it’ll be,’ and it was meant to be,” Blue said.
Blue cited Michael Jackson’s “Billie Jean” as the first record that truly inspired him to create music. 
“That’s the first record that I listened to that really made me fall in love with the artistry of music,” Blue said. “It drew me in in a way I’d never been drawn in before.”
 Blue went on to relate the inspiration gained from this song to his surge over the course of the last season, comparing Jackson’s detail-oriented approach to his own. 
“I thought about every little thing, every detail of every song and I wanted to make sure we served the purpose of that,” Blue said.
While Blue is still finding his footing musically, this attention to detail is important to him. He explained that his relationship with Keys as his former coach and current mentor has been instrumental in his focus as an artist, overwhelming him with her depth of knowledge many times. 
“I think the biggest thing for me is her ability to really fall in love with every detail of everything,” he said in regard to what he has noticed about her attention to his music after his run on the show ended. 
“Even the first time she mentored, she was not only an insane vocalist, but it’s as if you were getting a world-class artist […] musical producer and arranger in one,” Morrissey said.
For many fans, Monday night is a resurgence of this talent and chemistry shared between the contestants and coaches that has been the show’s cornerstone for 12 seasons. Judging from their comments on Saturday, Morrissey, Blue and the entire team at The Voice see no end in sight for the series.
The new season debuted on Monday at 5 p.m. PT.

Vincent van Gogh was a chronic alcoholic, his most celebrated paintings borne from absinthe-induced hallucinations before he shot himself in the chest. Sylvia Plath, after writing The Bell Jar,  notoriously gassed herself in the oven after a string of previous suicide attempts. David Foster Wallace suffered from crippling mental illness while writing his greatest work, Infinite Jest, and hanged himself after wrestling with depression for decades —  historically speaking, he was even an exception because he didn’t die penniless and unknown. 
Bukowski, Winehouse, Woolf, Hemingway, Cobain, Rothko … the list is unending. I grew up on the voices of these artistic visionaries whether they were painters, writers or musicians. Their very names have heralded artistic valor of biblical proportions for me. These names are imbued with passion and prestige, yet the living, breathing people who bore them were largely depressed, leading tumultuous lives. Though I laud and fondly remember them, many of their lives were fueled by drugs, depression and tragedy. Naturally, this blurs the line between venerating the works and legacy of artists themselves and celebrating the very essence of their pain. 
They are part of a narrative as long as human history — the idea of the tortured artist is culturally debated, but to me it has always been a self-evident truth. Art is a mimicry and celebration of humanity, and mankind’s greatest virtue is surviving adversity. The notion of tortured artists, however, has been largely centered on a skewed assessment of the creative process: that pain is a prerequisite for producing great art. 
I have personally fallen prey to this cultural inclination to glamorize pain in the name of art. For a spell in my mid-teens, I found myself longing for misfortune. Twisted, I know. I wanted to mimic the raw emotion and dark humanity manifest in some of my favorite works, but this proved a futile task at the time, given my comparatively pure and wholesome life experiences. If I could only live through their afflictions and decipher what makes them tick, then I could be like them: one of the greats. 
As a culture, we have a tendency to glamorize pain as an offshoot of art. Scores of contemporary entertainers have taken their own lives, yet the discourse surrounding their legacies is focused on their artistic accomplishments rather than their demises. When it comes to artists, we are quick to dismiss typical stigmas surrounding suffering and mental illness in favor of their artistic contributions. The tortured artist label has become a damaging myth that impedes and minimizes the humanity of our most celebrated icons. 
The implication that happiness and creative genius are mutually exclusive is unsettling and forms a paradox between the desire to be happy and the desire to create. By willfully and eternally glamorizing images of soulfully melancholy artists, we ignore the very real mental welfare struggles that make them who they are. We shouldn’t be so close-minded as to say suffering causes art but rather that suffering is a symptom of artistic talent and an inherent drive to create. What tortures artists is also what makes them great. 
While we romanticize the suffering of the artistic process, we also find comfort in it. We feel a little less alone; we understand what it means to be human a little better. To the masses, art is a lesson in coping with the curse of consciousness. If we are going to suffer regardless, we might as well find solace in the fact that others can draw meaning from sharing in our pain. 
In the end, the lesson I take from this is not to celebrate pain or treat it as a badge of artistic legitimacy. Rather, the most celebrated artists chose not to recoil, wallow in self-pity or resign themselves to passivity but to harness their suffering and turn it into something the world could cherish. When I feel alone, I read Bukowski and am comforted by his loneliness. When I have insomnia, I let Chester Bennington sing me to sleep. And, in realizing that my pain can be just as pretty as that of the greats, I create. I write poems, emotional ramblings and columns expressing my angst and I understand that we make art not just because it’s cleansing but also because we need to do it to cope. 
Maybe it’s not that artists are broken or that broken people are artists, but each of us has the ability to create beauty from pain, a reprieve from suffering in vain. At least that’s what I’d like to believe.

Though Ground Zero Performance Café, a beloved campus coffee shop and study spot, has been closed for the past month, it briefly reopened its doors on Monday evening for the first Open Mic Night of the fall semester. The potential performers began trickling in at 8:30 p.m. to get their names in the lottery, and by 9 p.m., the space was full. Even without Ground Zero’s signature milkshakes in sight, the audience was buzzing with anticipation for the night to come. 
There were a variety of different acts, including a neuroscience-themed comedy show, magic tricks, poetry recitations and myriad different musical acts performed by USC students as well as anyone from outside USC that wants to share their talents. The majority of these acts encompassed themes of love and heartbreak, but others discussed letting go of fears of the future, self-confidence and social justice. 
Open Mic Nights provide a safe space for new and experienced performers to come and share anything and everything in a smaller space within the school. Katherine Martinez, a junior majoring in psychology, took advantage of the welcoming environment to debut her poetry for the first time by reciting her poem, “Evolved.” 
“I’ve been writing poetry for over a year now, but have never performed,” Martinez said. “I thought it was time to get out of my comfort zone and just do it.”
Open Mic Night also allows students and local community members who have been creating and releasing their own productions to share the content they have been working on for years with their peers.
Brandon Movay, the stage name of Brandon Douglas, a sophomore majoring in creative writing, performed two of his self-produced songs, “Celebration” and “On My Way.” Douglas has been writing and producing music for about five years and released his first EP Flower Talk this past summer. “On My Way” talked about the difficulties that college students have trying to navigate through their futures.
“I wrote this during my first semester of college,” Douglas said. “I didn’t know what I was doing or if I was in the right major. But I realized that I am at USC, I don’t know where I’m going, but I know I am on my way.”
More self-produced acts followed, including three uplifting and powerful pieces by another producer under the stage name Evin Skye. One of them, titled “Won’t Let Go,” focused on facing one’s fears and using them to better oneself and make the most of life.
“It’s about seizing the day and doing something that scares you,” Skye said. “I am trying to make the most of every day and face my fears.”
There is some time allotted after all scheduled performances for any last minute acts to take the stage. The night concluded with an impromptu recitation by sophomore Ugonnaya Chilaka of her spoken word poem, “The Art of Letting Go.” 
Open Mic Nights have given students a place to share their talents and passions without fear, and display the creativity and capabilities of the USC community. 
“I am always so amazed at the amount of talent there is in this room and at USC,” said Lily-Katie Diaz, a sophomore majoring in English literature. 
Diaz covered a song by Canadian artist Danielle Andrade. 
Open Mic Nights will continue at Ground Zero every Monday from 9 to 11 p.m. until Dec. 11.

On Tuesday morning, the college athletics world was rocked to its core with earth-shattering news. A long-running FBI investigation revealed widespread corruption in college basketball, resulting in the indictment of 10 men, including Adidas employees, sports agents and four assistant coaches: Arizona’s Emmanuel Richardson, Auburn’s Chuck Person, Oklahoma State’s Lamont Evans and, yes, USC’s very own Tony Bland.
Bland, like the other three coaches, was accused of “bribery conspiracy,” and “solicitation of bribes,” among other charges. He is alleged to have taken cash gifts from sports agents and financial advisors in exchange for convincing his players to sign with specific agencies once they turned pro. In a press conference, the Justice Department announced that the coaches could potentially face a maximum of 80 years in prison if found guilty of the crimes. 
When most college sports fans see their school implicated in any sort of NCAA investigation, they are worried, maybe even scared for the well-being of the program they support. But when USC is mentioned in the same sentence as words like “probe” and “potential sanctions,” it feels like the Grim Reaper himself has descended back upon South Central.
When I saw the news, I couldn’t help but think of a Kanye West line on the song “Knock you Down.”: “This is bad, real Bad, Michael Jackson.” 
After USC was hit with crippling NCAA sanctions in 2010 stemming from improper benefits given to Heisman winner Reggie Bush and basketball standout OJ Mayo, it took nearly a decade for both teams to recover. The Trojans football team just returned to national prominence with last year’s Rose Bowl win, after being slapped with a two-year bowl ban and, perhaps more ruinous, a reduction in scholarships. USC was unable to field a full football roster until 2014.
Recovery was also a long and winding road for the basketball program. After its sanctions were handed down, it was not until 2015 that current coach Andy Enfield was able to end the team’s five-year NCAA Tournament drought. It was also the Trojans’ first winning record in that time span. 
Last season, the men’s basketball team took another leap forward. It finished at 26-10, the most wins in USC history. The Trojans went on to make it to the second round of the NCAA Tournament as an 11-seed with a major upset victory over Baylor in the Round of 64. 
Entering this season, there was more hype surrounding the basketball team, since well, possibly ever. The team was set to return virtually all of last year’s core lineup while adding Duke transfer Derryck Thornton Jr. and highly touted recruit Charles O’ Bannon Jr. Media outlets position them as high as top-10 2018 pre-season rankings. 
Now what was supposed to be a breakout year for a historically downtrodden basketball team is completely up in the air. The best-case (but wildly unlikely) scenario is that further investigation reveals Bland to be one bad egg in an otherwise clean program. However even if that is the situation, ESPN’s Darren Rovell pointed out on Twitter that in 2013, “NCAA said head coaches are responsible for everything,” and can no longer use assistant coaches as scapegoats for violations. 
It seems like USC basketball is once again on the verge of collapse, along with the entire institution of college basketball. According to the FBI, the party is just getting started. It uttered by far the ominous statement of the day when a spokesperson delivered a message to college coaches around the country. 
“We have your playbook,” New York FBI Assistant Director in Charge William Sweeney Jr. said at a press conference. “Our investigation is ongoing. We are conducting additional interviews as we speak.”
Not to sound too football-centric, but even if the basketball program goes down in flames, I can only hope the corruption is confined to that one sport and not the entire athletics department, like last time. USC simply cannot afford it again. 
It appears as though Athletic Director Lynn Swann is saying and doing the right things as far as handling the issue. He immediately placed Bland on administrative leave and enlisted a former FBI director to conduct an independent investigation. At the very least, USC is prepared for these types of code red scenarios. 
While it’s disappointing to see USC sports back on the brink of disaster, it’s worth noting that these allegations are much more serious than last time. When it comes to the issue of college athletes being paid, I tend to believe that they should be compensated fairly given the amount of revenue they generate for universities. I did not think it was wrong when Ohio State players traded their game memorabilia for tattoos. I did not think it was wrong for Johnny Manziel to make money off his own signature in an autograph deal back in 2013 when he was the quarterback at Texas A&M. But what Bland potentially did by accepting bribes and capitalizing off of his influence over college athletes is unequivocally and morally wrong, not to mention illegal. 
Now, as USC fans we wait and hope this is the end rather than the beginning of a much longer, more painful sequel to 2010.

Following their win against Cal, the Trojans have a short week before they face Washington State on Friday in Pullman, Wa. In front of a sellout crowd expected at Martin Stadium, head coach Clay Helton and the Trojans will be put to the test. With injuries piling up and an explosive Washington State team playing in its own stadium, the Trojans have been put on upset alert by many around the country. 
Scouting the Cougars 
Led by head coach Mike Leach, the Cougars have come out of the gate strong in 2017. With a 4-0 record, Washington State is currently ranked 16th. This is due, in part, to a dynamic offense. Senior quarterback Luke Falk returns after a junior year that put him on the map. After forcing four interceptions against Cal, the Trojans hope to replicate some of their success in Pullman. 
But that could be a tall task. 
Helton said Falk is “about as efficient as there is in the league right now.” 
He’s been one of the best passers in the country, ranking second in touchdowns and fifth in passing yards. 
“I think he’s got a really good skill set,” defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said. “He’s played in that system for a long time, he sees the field well and he doesn’t lock in on his first read.” 
Falk and the Cougars’ offense will test USC’s defense with their run and gun offense, made famous by Leach during his time at Texas Tech. Leach’s offensive philosophy is predicated on getting the ball to his playmakers in space. The running back combination of senior Jamal Morrow and sophomore James Williams has provided Falk with weapons out of the backfield. 
While the Cougars don’t run the ball often, Morrow and Williams are two players who will be watched closely by Helton and the defensive staff. Junior receiver Tavares Martin, the Cougars’ leading receiver with 390 yards and six touchdowns on the year, will test the Trojans’ secondary. 
Defensively, the Cougars are led by redshirt senior middle linebacker Isaac Dotson, who leads the team with 26 tackles. Sophomore safety Jalen Thompson is a player to watch in the secondary for Washington State. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold, who has thrown seven interceptions on the year, will need to cut down on turnovers. 
Healing Up 
Heading to Pullman on Friday, the Trojans still have several key players banged up. Junior wide receiver Deontay Burnett was held out for the second day in a row.
“I think he’s gonna be able to go,” Helton said. “We’ve been pretty cautious with him.”
Junior running racks Ronald Jones and Aca’Cedric Ware were both limited in Tuesday’s practice, but Helton expects them to be available. Junior linebacker Porter Gustin is still doubtful for Friday’s tilt. 
Redshirt sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe is still working his way back to the field. 
“We have a calendar mapped out,” Helton said Imatorbhebhe’s rehab. “Things change, everyone’s body is different, but we sat down and met with our staff and Daniel and got a plan so that hopefully within a couple weeks, he can get back.” 
While junior tight end Tyler Petite has done well with more snaps, getting Imatorbhebhe back would undoubtedly be big for the offense. While Helton and the staff don’t plan to rush Imatorbhebhe back, Helton said he was getting closer.
Without a bye week, the Trojans don’t have a lot of time to recover. Helton and the staff have had to adjust accordingly. His first meeting every day is with head athletic trainer Russ Romano. Afterwards, Helton, Romano and his entire staff met to develop a plan for every player on the injury list. 
“Going 12 games straight, you have to have a great plan for each kid,” Helton said.
Angeline Leaves Team 
News came out on Monday that redshirt sophomore Cary Angeline has decided to leave the team. Citing homesickness and a lack of playing time, the Pennsylvania native will look to get a fresh start at another school. 
“Cary’s a great kid,” Helton said. “He wants to find a place closer to home to be able to play. Unbelievable student and person. We wish him nothing but the best.” 
With Angeline’s departure, Trojans’ depth at tight end will be tested. Imatorbhebhe’s absence means the Trojans will have to rely on Petite and freshmen Josh Falo and Erik Krommenhoek to carry the load until reinforcements come.

USC placed men’s basketball associate head coach Tony Bland on administrative leave following his arrest on Monday. 
Bland was arrested along with three fellow NCAA assistant basketball coaches and six others as part of a corruption ring, according to federal papers that became public Tuesday. The ring allegedly involved bribes used to connect top college basketball players with financial advisers. He was released after appearing in court on a $100,000 bond. He is scheduled to appear in the U.S. District Court in New York on Oct. 10.
Bland was put on administrative leave on Tuesday after the athletic department was “surprised to learn” of both the investigation and the arrest. The University has since hired former FBI director Louis Freeh to spearhead an internal investigation, and reached out to both the NCAA and the FBI to pledge the school’s “full cooperation” in the future.
“We were shocked to learn this morning through news reports about the FBI investigation and arrests related to NCAA basketball programs, including the arrest of USC assistant coach Tony Bland,” USC athletic director Lynn Swann said in a statement. “USC Athletics maintains the highest standards in athletic compliance across all of our programs and does not tolerate misconduct in any way. We will cooperate fully with the investigation and will assist authorities as needed, and if these allegations are true, we will take the needed action.”
The FBI also charged Lamont Evans of Oklahoma State, Chuck Person of Auburn and Emanuel “Book” Richardson of Arizona. Besides the four coaches involved, the case charged financial advisers, sports agents and Jim Gatto, the Adidas director of global basketball marketing.
The bureau held a press conference on Tuesday to address the charges, led by Joon Kim, the acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Kim described the situation as the “dark underbelly” of college athletes, describing an environment with “managers and financial advisers circling blue chip prospects like coyotes.”
According to an affidavit released by federal prosecutors, investigators have been involved with the case since 2015. At least part of the evidence in the case was provided by undercover FBI agents who posed as advisers to gain access to the bribery ring.
This document identifies two corruption scandals: one that used bribes to coerce coaches into pushing their players toward certain financial advisers, and one that paid high school athletes in cash to sign with specific universities.
Bland was only charged in relation to the first. In July, he had a secret meeting in a Las Vegas hotel room with sports agent Christian Dawkins, who was also charged in the case. The pair discussed the signings of two unidentified USC players — a recent signee and a rising sophomore. 
In the meeting, which was secretly recorded, Bland promised to “mold the players and put them in the lap” of Dawkins, according to the documents provided. Bland is also charged with overseeing the exchange of envelopes filled with $9,000 in cash to two families of USC basketball players as part of the scandal.
This is Bland’s fifth season with the Trojans, and his biography on the USC basketball website credits him as one of the keys to recruiting players in the last few years of the program’s success.
Bland has served as the associate head coach since 2014 after spending one year as an assistant coach. Prior to his tenure at USC, Bland worked as an assistant coach at his alma mater, San Diego State University.
Both the University and the Pac-12 conference stated their concern over the announcement, which allegedly came as a surprise to both parties. The Pac-12 was involved in two cases, with assistant coaches from both Arizona and USC being part of the scandal.
“Protection of our student-athletes, and of the integrity of competition, is the Conference’s top priority,” Pac-12 conference commissioner Larry Scott said in a statement. “We are still learning the facts of this matter, but these allegations, if true, are profoundly upsetting to me. They strike at the heart of the integrity of our programs, and of the game that so many people love and play the right way.
Time for Swann to impose self sanctions including loss of scholarships.
Just when USC Basketball and Football get back on track…more sanctions incoming.
What Football sanctions are coming based upon what rules broken? Never thought much of Bland or Hart for
coaching players. Good recruiters that Enfield needed to bring in players on the west-coast where he lacked any
presence in this area. AD Swann showed his usual unawareness of things happening around him. Hard to believe
that Coach Enfield had no knowledge of these arrangements for the last couple of years.
Bland better cut a deal and tell everything he knows.   What did Andy Enfield know?

Hours after news broke on Tuesday morning that USC men’s basketball assistant coach Tony Bland was arrested on charges that included bribery and fraud, the University’s athletic department took swift strides that culminated in the commencement of its own internal investigation, hiring former FBI director Louis Freeh to handle the case.
Bland and nine others were brought down by a sting operation conducted by the FBI. 
Freeh is an expert in compliance investigations. He served as FBI Director from 1993 to 2001, and before that he was an Assistant U.S. Attorney. 
Freeh has experience in NCAA compliance. His firm, Freeh Group, was hired by Penn State in November of2011 to conduct the investigation on Jerry Sandusky’s child abuse scandal when he was assistant coach at the football program.
In July of 2012, Freeh published a 267-page report on Penn State condemning the highest-ranking university officials for covering up Sandusky’s criminal actions and thereby endangering minors. It was Freeh’s report that led to the toppling of head football coach Joe Paterno and a slew of high-ranking PSU officials.
In fact, evidence Freeh’s team uncovered was key in a lawsuit decided earlier this year that indicted former-PSU President Graham Spanier and other university administrators on charges of child endangerment. 
Later on Tuesday morning, Athletic Director Lynn Swann released a statement that the university was “shocked” by the news and that his department would “fully cooperate” with the federal investigation moving forward. 
USC Vice President for Athletic Compliance Mike Blanton put out a second statement announcing Bland’s immediate administrative leave. Blanton stressed USC’s “highest priority on athletic compliance” and backed that by declaring that the school had hired Freeh to conduct the investigation.
Such a thorough investigation does not come cheap. According to a Penn State trustee, Freeh’s services cost the university $8.3 million. 
USC’s move to hire Freeh may indicate a no-nonsense attitude toward the Bland scandal and its impetus to get to the bottom of the case sooner rather than later at all costs. 
“It was Freeh’s report that led to the toppling of head football coach Joe Paterno and a slew of high-ranking PSU officials.”  Incorrect.  The Board of Directors removed coach Paterno eight months before Frech issued his report..  I don’t know what the definition is of “a slew”, but Freeh work resulted in only one other official  charge.
Additionally all conspiracy and perjury charges were dismissed or found not guilty for all defendants..  Basically Freeh entire story of a massive conspiracy at PSU failed the test of Pennsylvania courts. The only charge that the administrators were convicted of is a single count of failing to report  child abuse. A fact that was well known to prosecutors before Freeh issue his report.
It should also point out that the NCAA stripped Paterno of 111 wins based on Freeh’s report.  They later returned all those wins.  What does that tell you?
It’s 100% wrong that “It was Freeh’s report that led to the toppling of head football coach Joe Paterno.”
Paterno was fired before Freeh was hired. Paterno died about 6 months before Freeh released his report.
USC may come to regret hiring Freeh because most of his reports have been severely criticized.
Freeh has been ultimately right on every one though.
Another scandal on Nikias’ watch — please Board of Trustees, it’s time to get a new president!
Louis Freeh will do a complete hack of the USC investigation as he did at Penn State. He did irreparable harm to Penn State via a hastily prepared report that selectively pick and chose facts to suit his pre-determined judgement.  FACT:  Louis Freeh is the same man who as FBI director investigated the 1996 Atlanta Olympic bombings and publicly accused the security guard, Richard Jewell,  who found the bomb of planting it for publicity sake. Despite Jewell’s adamant public denials, he was subjected to law enforcement accusations and public ridicule and scorn that he was an unmarried loser who did not have a permanent job and still lived at home with his mother.  Su sequent more thorough investigation characterized Freeh’s shoddy investigation as a rush to judgement.
Despite actually being a hero whose actions saved hundreds of people from injury, his public humiliation inevitably contributed to Jewell’s untimely early death a few years later.  
USC has screwed itself hiring this overpriced clown.  Fight On.
I hope this investigation doesn’t cost multiple millions of dollars. Such a sum would be ridiculous. Surely USC could have found an excellent investigator who does not charge such staggering sums. (Of course, USC may have wanted a “big name” investigator, and it may not care about the cost thereof.)
Not shocking here.
The money in this game is staggering. The suppliers are jockeying for the next air jordans.
Like college text books, very corrupt business.
Hey Freeh, no one is innocent in this game from equipment managers, ball boys, ANYONE!!
where is the crime ???
i dont see any crime here.
just a fed shakedown maybe.
Tax fraud for starters.

The Panhellenic Council released a letter Tuesday to oppose Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry’s proposal to instate GPA requirements for students to participate in Greek recruitment.
Carry’s proposal would require a minimum grade point average of 2.5 and completion of 12 units of coursework at USC before students are eligible.
The letter, which was addressed to Carry, president C.L. Max Nikias, provost Michael Quick and Associate Vice Provost for Student Affairs Monique Allard, was read at an open forum at Tuesday’s Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting. No senior administrators were in attendance at the meeting, but the letter was delivered to the four addressees earlier in the day.
The Panhellenic Council stated in its letter that “a change in recruitment eligibility would work against their stated mission of empowering women and enabling them to reach their fullest potential through academic success, campus involvement, community service and interfraternal collaboration.” 
“We are concerned that if new potential members who want to join our community are not able to, they will not be able to receive the education that our community provides or mentorship and wellness that come with having older girls to turn to,” Panhellenic Council president Jamie Kwong said. 
Kwong also stressed that the new eligibility requirement would cause sororities financial stress.
“If we were not able to take first semester new students, we would be losing [financial support], and that would then have to be shifted onto our active members,” Kwong said. “This would make membership extremely difficult to afford, especially when a lot of girls already have to work to do so.” 
The letter also conveyed the Panhellenic Council’s concern that, despite expressing its sentiments to Carry, the organization’s voice has not resonated with the administration nor the USC community. 
“We understand the importance of fostering a constructive relationship with the administration and working to ensure that the first semester experience for any student at USC is a positive one,” the letter read. “That’s why we are reaching out to you about our concerns and hope for the future.” 
The letter went on to emphasize the Panhellenic Council’s willingness to work closely with the administration to better understand the issues behind the proposal and find alternative solutions. It also requested that the administrators addressed in the letter provide the Panhellenic Council with their availabilities to discuss an action plan. 
“We really wanted to make sure our voice was understood,” Kwong said. “We want to make sure we’re having an open dialogue with the administration.”
Last week, the Interfraternity Council released a similar letter, asking the University’s administrators to reconsider deferring freshman recruitment to the second semester.
