Undergraduate Student Government senators reversed their vote confirming funding branch positions after receiving complaints of improper appointments within USG during Tuesday’s Senate meeting.
The original vote, which was cast three weeks ago, approved the funding branch appointments made by USG President Edwin Saucedo. No formal complaints had been filed within USG concerning the funding branch appointments, as Saucedo confirmed, but several senators, including Sabrina Enriquez, described funding branch applicants bringing their concerns to them personally outside of the formal process.
“Based on the amount of concern I have, and so many individuals in our organization have had and brought to our attention, it would be irresponsible in my own role to not bring it to a vote,” Enriquez said.
Not all of the senators believed that a recension of the vote was in order. Sen. Daniel Newman was concerned about the precedent that was being set for the next semester, despite a potential issue with unfair appointments.
“The funding votes may not have been as fair as we had hoped,” Newman said. “But I feel that this opens the door to rescinding things in the future.”
Sen. Kate Oh presented redacted interview information to the Senate, which was given to her by Jenny Di, Saucedo’s chief of staff. The interviews did not contain personal information, but instead illustrated the experience of applicants with what they perceived as a biased selection process.
“I found that [out of] 40 applications, only 17 were granted interviews and 11 were given positions,” Oh said. “And out of the 23 that weren’t given interviews, 17 had prior funding experience, and 10 had both funding and USG experience, but weren’t even granted interviews.”
Furthermore, Oh said, four out of the 11 appointed funding branch members had no explicit funding experience, and two had no prior funding or USG experience. These statistics, Oh claimed, indicate that Saucedo’s appointments were biased towards people he personally favored rather than those who were the most qualified for the job.
Di and Saucedo denied claims of inappropriate appointments, especially concerning funding branch members who were also members of the Trojan Knights. Oh said that all three Trojan Knights that made the interview round within funding branch were granted positions, which raised suspicions since Saucedo is also a member of the Trojan Knights.
“I’m not saying those aren’t valid statistics. Those are all true facts,” Di said. “I don’t know if I can address every single one of [the statistics], but [Saucedo] is the only one of us who is a Knight, and he was not the one who called people back for interviews.”
Saucedo agreed, asserting that he considered all applicants equally through a fair and unbiased selection process. Furthermore, he emphasized the point that appointments were not solely his decision.
“I let each one of our executive board members do whatever they felt was best,” Saucedo said. “[Treasurer] Christian [Edwards] thought it was best to interview 17 people because he was confident in those people. I never pushed on any of these people, [and] there were Knights who were rejected on the first round.”
Some senators and executive council members were concerned with the timing of the vote, considering that the transitionary period for new executive members was about to finish and that executive members need to be selected before summer recess begins to ensure smooth rollout in fall semester.
“It would be a big mistake for us make such a drastic motion of rescinding any votes at this point in this process.” Sen. Tyler Matheson said. “Simply because of the lack of knowledge we have on the topic, that’s a mistake on our part.”
Enriquez and Sen. Josh Lurie, who responded to Matheson’s comments, spoke on the process of fairness and the need to resolve the issue despite issues of timeliness.
“The timing of the vote and how it affects the summer and what happens, should not affect the vote,” Lurie said. “If there was a wrong we should fix it. I hope everyone’s making a decision based on informed conversation.”
The Senate voted 7 to 5 to rescind the prior confirmation vote in order to reconsider the appointments. In response, Saucedo proposed an emergency Senate meeting to be held within the next three days.

The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted SC Voter Registration Day on Tuesday in Hahn Plaza, which invited Trojans to participate in the political process through voter registration and civic discussion.
Partnering with organizations including the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk, USC Political Student Assembly, USC College Republicans, USC College Democrats, USC Latina/o Student Assembly, Asian Pacific American Student Assembly and the Black Student Assembly at USC, the program seeks to encourage students from all backgrounds and demographics to exercise their rights to vote and engage in political discourse during this election year and beyond. Partner organizations set up booths near Tommy Trojan to discuss issues with students and motivate them to get involved.
Held between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., Voter Registration Day provided free pizza and raffle tickets for four $25 Amazon gift cards as incentives to register. Partner organizations also handed out other prizes and gear at their booths throughout the event.
The program featured guest student speakers including Edwin Saucedo, Undergraduate Student Government President and Rini Sampath, former USG president. Both students offered their perspectives on why student voting and civic discussion are vital.
“Wherever people fall on [the political] spectrum, it’s our opportunity to make our voice heard,” Sampath said. “That’s why I think it’s important that students, faculty and our entire community gets out there and not only registers to vote but also goes to the polls.”
Saucedo emphasized the importance of participating in  state and local elections in addition to the presidential primary and general elections.
“For me personally, I look beyond the presidential election most of the time … because I feel like you can make a bigger impact at the local level,” Saucedo said. “I want to challenge you to go out … and vote for not only who you want your next president to be, but also who you want to represent you in the senate, city council, the state assembly and the legislature overall.”
In September, 549 students registered on Voter Registration Day alone, more than any other event in Los Angeles County. Even more students registered at different campus programs throughout the year, making USC one of the most successful colleges in the nation in terms of voter registration, according to Schnur. This year, the Unruh Institute hopes to surpass the previous year’s event.
“Our goal for today is to get a larger number of students to register than we did in the fall,” said Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute. “And with the primary election only a few weeks away, we’re in a pretty good position to beat that number.”
Students also commented on the unique nature of this election cycle, emphasizing the significance of this election in rewriting American politics and the important role the next president will play in determining U.S. policy.
“Fiscally, I think this election will be very, very important,” said Tiffany Hosseini, president of the USC College Republicans. “The fiscal policies our next leader is going to adopt will affect us for the rest of our lives, so it’s very important that we choose a leader who will make fiscal policy and create legislation that’s going to benefit us and our future.”
Austin MacLeod, membership and recruitment director for the College Republicans, said this election will influence the future of politics.
“I think this election year has disproven some of the common assumptions about the elections,” said MacLeod. “When you see the rise of Sanders, an outsider, and Trump, an outsider, I think that this election will … really influence who is willing to run, who wins, and who is willing to come out to vote from now on.”
Schnur challenged students at the event to defy the common millennial stereotype of apathy towards politics and instead become more active in civil discourse and in shaping the future of the United States
“It’s really easy for old people to think that young people don’t care,” Schnur said. “And the best way to demonstrate that that’s not true is by registering to vote and voting on election day.”

The inaugural Civic Engagement Symposium was hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics Tuesday night. High school students, mentored by undergraduates participating in the Civic Engagement Internship, shared their findings about voter turnout to the surrounding community.
Throughout the semester, six undergraduate students went to classrooms once a week at New Designs Charter School and Alliance Neuwirth Leadership Academy and taught students about civic engagement as part of a for-credit political science course or as a volunteer.
The high schoolers then created tri-fold posters expressing the root causes of the lack of voter participation in their community, such as a lack of information and language barriers. They then presented their solutions on how to increase turnout. One poster read, “We all make a difference by making our voices heard.”
After an hour-long open forum in the University Fishbowl Chapel, Unruh Institute Director Dan Schnur delivered remarks about the background of the program.
“When we at USC decided one year ago that we wanted to do something to make a difference in the community surrounding campus, we talked about all of the challenges communities face: safety, clean air and water, good jobs,” Schnur said.
The internship program resulted from discussions from many students about how to best impact the community.
“What we realized together is that every one of those problems comes from the same place: a lack of political participation in communities that need to be represented the most,” Schnur said.
During their introduction, the undergraduates discussed why they got involved with the program and introduced one of their students, who reflected on their semester’s work.
Cashae Ellis, a junior majoring in sociology, taught at New Designs Charter Schools. As someone who grew up in the neighborhood, she elaborated on the importance of participating in the program.
“I know the system they grew up in, and I personally was not taught anything about civic engagement in high school,” Ellis said. “So I wanted to make sure that these students were able to learn what they need to know before they get off in the ‘real world.’”
Sophomore Rachel Udabe, a sophomore majoring in political science and policy, planning and development, and Kyra Schoonover, a junior majoring in political science history, also taught a civics class together at New Designs Charter Schools.
“I thought it’s beautiful that we have the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of these high school students and tell them that there is a way for them to get involved, whether voting or being active in the community,” Udabe said.
In addition to imparting knowledge about voter turnout to the local community, the mentors develop leadership skills as well in heading their own classes.
As the staff associate for the Unruh Institute and the director of the civic engagement internship, Catherine Shieh believes the program gives all participants valuable skills.
“They run the whole thing,” Shieh said. “They learn classroom management, checks for understanding, teacher lingo. It’s very teacher-focused.”
The program had 12 interns teaching 140 students about the importance of civic engagement. Though the program finished its first year and its effects are not yet known, Shieh believes that going into classrooms can inspire the youth to share what they learn with the rest of the community.
“Politics can and does start in the classroom,” Shieh said. “If it’s inspiring people in the community to want to invest in their own community, I think this is the best goal we can bring. Sometimes all it takes is just a little nudge.”

Brian Conyer, a part-time business administration student at the USC Marshall School of Business, has raised $1 million to fund GIBLIB, the startup he founded to help surgeons learn from each other online.
The company aims to partner with academic institutions, where each institution would have its own channel with medical lectures or surgical videos of different areas.
GIBLIB will enable the surgeons to do a live surgery so that other people can have either a 360-degree or a split-screen view of procedures. This way, prospective physicians will be able to see the surgery along with what is actually happening inside the body.
“This is a great way for medical students and physicians to access information from the thought leaders in the field,” Conyer said. “It is digitizing the conference experience and giving them a safe place to have clinical discussions.”
According to Conyer, the goal of the startup is to connect the global community of surgeons who wish to communicate with each other but otherwise lack the ability to do so.
“Not everyone has the same resources and access to top medical schools and top surgeons,” Conyer said. “This will now give them access to that content.”
Conyer got the idea for GIBLIB while working in the sales department at Intuitive Surgical, a company that manufactures robotics surgical systems.
“My job was basically to convince surgeons about the use of robot as a new technology,” Conyer said. “I noticed that they were passing videos and flash drives between each other and spending hours on YouTube, trying to find good videos. So I quit my job and decided to build this centralized platform for them.”
Conyer received the funding for his startup from an angel investor group of healthcare executives and doctors residing on the East Coast after a long period where Conyer struggled to receive funds.
“It was a very long process,” Conyer said. “I was frustrated with the lack of progress in the fundraising.”
However, after pitching his idea to an acquaintance he met at his sister’s restaurant, Conyer found the support he was looking for.
“From there, it just went ahead, and we got our funding from his group,” Conyer said.
Conyer’s team consists of several USC alumni such as Jihye Shin, Marshall MBA class of 2014, and Annie Chi So, a Viterbi School of Engineering graduate of 2008. Director of Neuroradiology at Keck School of Medicine of USC Meng Law, Assistant Professor of Neurosurgery at Keck Gabriel Zada, Assistant Professor of Surgery at Keck Daniel Oh and Associate Professor of Engineering Practice at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering Ashish Soni are on the advisory board.
Conyer emphasized the role that USC had in helping him begin building his startup.
“Being [an MBA candidate] got me thinking as an entrepreneur,” Conyer said. “After meeting the speakers [Marshall] brought from USC alumni, I realized that they had the same backgrounds. It gave me the confidence to get out of my comfort zone, quit my dream job and pursue this.”
Conyer also received support from the team that worked to develop GIBLIB from start to finish.
“I think this product is exciting, but mainly it is because of the investors, advisors and everyone who jumped on board as a team, which made it a success,” Conyer said.
The Beta version of GIBLIB will be out by the end of this month and can be found online.

For USC beach volleyball players senior Alexa Strange and junior Sophie Bukovec, the journey to the University of Southern California has been anything but ordinary. Despite multiple detours, the two upperclassmen somehow ended up together in the same city, at the same school and on the same side of the net.
Strange, a 6-foot senior, is originally from San Clemente, California, while Bukovec, a 6-foot-1 junior, hails from Toronto, Canada. The duo currently make up the No. 2 pairing on the top-ranked USC beach volleyball team and are in their final season playing together after being named AVCA All-Americans in the Trojans’ undefeated run to the 2015 AVCA National Championship. This season, they’ve helped guide the Women of Troy to a 26-2 overall record while touting an impressive 29-8 record of their own as a pair. However, though they now share the same sand, the routes they took to get to Troy greatly differed.
For Strange, a former indoor prep All-American as a senior out of San Clemente High School, playing collegiate volleyball was always in the plans. Whether that was beach or indoors, however, was another story.
Beach volleyball wasn’t yet an official collegiate sport at the time, so Strange decided to look for schools around the country to play solely indoors. She had initially pledged to play at the University of Colorado, a program that was entering a rebuilding phase. However, upon realizing that she wanted to play on a competitive team in college right out of the gate, Strange decided to reopen her recruitment. One school that intrigued her was the University of Nebraska, a traditional volleyball powerhouse known for its passionate fan base and sold-out arenas. After finding out that a scholarship was open for her, Strange immediately accepted their offer and signed to play for the Cornhuskers that fall.
So, off Strange went on the 1,516-mile trip across the country to the Midwest, trading the warm weather of sunny Orange County for the cold and unpredictable climate of Lincoln, Nebraska. During her freshman season in the fall of 2012, Strange appeared in 25 matches indoors as a reserve setter and opposite hitter. Luckily for her, the following spring semester would also be the first ever season that Nebraska would field a beach volleyball team. So, Strange transitioned to the sand in the spring of 2013 as part of the Huskers’ No. 1 pairing for the rest of the season.
Over time, however, Strange found herself wondering whether or not playing and living in Nebraska was really the right fit for her. During a trip to Los Angeles in which Nebraska took on USC at Merle Norman Stadium, Strange reconnected with current USC head coach Anna Collier, a figure she had known since the age of 14 through the USA Volleyball circuit. That meeting with Collier would prompt Strange to reevaluate what it was she wanted out of her college experience.
“When we came to play USC my freshman year, I saw Anna and she told me, ‘I can’t believe you’re at Nebraska — you never seemed like a Nebraska type of girl!’” Strange said. “And in the back of my mind, I was like, ‘I couldn’t agree more … I really don’t know what I’m doing here.’”
Eventually, the Midwestern lifestyle wasn’t one that Strange could see herself living in any longer. To her, nothing could match the sunny weather and beautiful beaches in California. So, in 2014, she decided to give up the indoor game at Nebraska to join a beach-only program.
Through her connection with Collier and with the desire to play closer to home, USC became the easy choice for Strange.
“I’m a California girl and a beach baby at heart, and that’s ultimately what brought me back here,” Strange said.
Bukovec’s decision to further her volleyball career coming out of high school was also plagued by some initial indecision. While playing on the beach was what she preferred, Bukovec wanted to experience what it was like to play indoors collegiately, so she decided to stay local and play at McMaster University in Ontario.
She made an immediate impact for the Marauders, leading her team to an unexpected conference championship and garnering Rookie of the Year, Final Four MVP and conference First Team All-Star honors in just one season. But, while the success and accolades poured in after that first year, Bukovec knew she wanted something more for herself.
“Playing indoors at McMaster was great, but the volleyball wasn’t too phenomenal, so I decided to reach out to schools in the States,” Bukovec said. “I looked at a few different schools like Columbia and Indiana, but I wanted to play both beach and indoor, so I narrowed down to schools in California.”
After finding out that Long Beach State University had a full scholarship available for her, Bukovec decided to pack her bags and make the long trek down North America.
In her first season at LBSU, she appeared in 27 matches, helping the 49ers to a 27-5 overall record and a second-round NCAA tournament appearance. However, the issues she had with the coaching staff made Bukovec question whether or not she was truly happy, so she requested her release from LBSU after the indoor season and looked for another destination.
Without much luck, Bukovec was set on going back home to Canada. However, she decided to check with USC just in case anything might have been available there for her.
“As soon as I got released, I contacted Anna to see if they had a scholarship available, and she said we could make it work, so that’s really all I needed,” Bukovec said.
She joined the Women of Troy the following season and made her debut in the spring of 2015.
All in all, the game of volleyball has taken Bukovec and Strange to great distances in their short time as student-athletes, and with a fair share of miles logged between them, some would call it crazy that they both ended up playing together at USC last year. Interestingly enough, however, their paths had crossed much earlier — in a different country.
The first real meeting between the two happened in the summer of 2013 at the U21 FIVB Beach Volleyball World Championships in Croatia. The two faced off against each other in pool play, with the then 17 year old Bukovec playing for Team Canada and the 18 year old Strange playing for Team USA. The match would ultimately go in the Canadian’s favor, but not before the two would connect on a personal level, turning from opponents to friends.
The two would meet once again in Cyprus one year later for another international tournament. It was during that very summer that Bukovec was looking to transfer from LBSU, and knowing that Strange had just arrived at USC, Bukovec reached out to her to get some more information.
“When I wanted to transfer, I was curious about life at USC and if it would be a good fit, so I asked Alexa what it was like there,” Bukovec said.
Strange added that Bukovec reached out to her on Facebook and asked for her honest opinion on the school.
“I explained what the culture was like around here and how good and competitive the team was, and I think those facts made it a pretty easy sell,” Strange said.
Sure enough, that was all the push Bukovec needed to commit to USC, as “Alexa really put the cherry on top.”
Whether it was by fate or pure coincidence that their paths somehow crossed and brought them together, what matters is that Bukovec and Strange have now found their way home at USC together. And while this season may be the last time they ever get to play on the same side of the net, the two look to make the most of it as they gear up for one last run together in hopes of winning the first-ever NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship.
“Winning the National Championship again would be a perfect ending for us, and especially winning it in Alexa’s senior year,” Bukovec said.
Strange too hopes to go out with a bang in her final season donning the cardinal and gold.
“The number one goal is to just win that National Championship,” Strange said. “We’ve been preparing literally all year for this moment and it’s all we can think about and all we can see, so all my energy just goes to wanting to win it all and do it with Sophie.”

Gussie Johns knows the value of trust.
As the starting goalie on the USC women’s lacrosse team, Johns has made 83 saves this season. Her consistency between the pipes helped the Women of Troy to a perfect 17-0 record during the regular season.
The sophomore’s supreme calmness in net can be largely attributed to her approach to the game.
“So much of being a goalie is trusting your defense or trusting your abilities or trusting that it’s just one goal that went in. Trusting that it’s a process of getting better,” Johns said.
The Washington, D.C. native has seen improvement in her game over the years — not just from positional and technical standpoints.
“I think the mental aspect of the game has improved much more than I ever thought it would honestly,” Johns said.
Johns typifies the ideal netminder: Her confidence between the ears translates into dominance between the posts. She moves on after conceding a goal, which is certainly easier said than done for someone who is the last line of defense.
Several factors contributed to her decision to pick up a goalie stick. Bo, one of her three older brothers, was a goalie. As is often the case, the younger sibling wanted to follow in the older sibling’s footsteps. But her love for the position also comes from her ability to customize her playing style.
“Goalie is unlike any other position obviously on the field,” Johns said. “Just the things you can do as a goalie are honestly endless. Every goalie in the NCAA plays differently.”
Her fluidity and lightning-fast reactions come from hours of training on McAlister Field ­— and from years of experience on different playing surfaces. Her tennis background contributes to her remarkable hand-eye coordination, while her seamless ability to push off in the crease comes in part from experience playing hockey. The choice to play goalie was a natural one for Johns.
“It just implements so many other aspects of different sports that I’m like why not play goalie?” Johns said.
While goaltending requires individual skills like sound positioning, Johns is hardly isolated from the rest of this USC defense.
“I think so much of defense is about playing together as a unit,” Johns said, stressing the importance organization in the zone defense USC runs. “It really is about how we all work together because if one person is off, it’s going to make the whole zone look bad and it would make the zone not function properly.”
As a program in just its fourth year of existence, the Women of Troy returned all of their defensive personnel from last season. USC’s goalie has been at the center of this defense’s evolution.
“Being able to have that core of people come back and really have that chemistry just right off the bat coming into this season and coming into this fall I think was a huge game-changer for us,” Johns said.
Johns has earned MPSF Defensive Player of the Week on multiple occasions this season, as her standout play is centered on the foundation of consistency. One of the keys to her steadiness in goal is her ability to adapt to the game along with the rest of the defense.
“Each game is going to present itself differently, and you kind of just try to take it one play at a time,” Johns said.
A collective sense of trust exists among this group — a sense of trust that, in many ways, starts with No. 3 in goal.
“It’s just been a great season, and I think from each game we’ve improved,” Johns said. “And we realize that each team is different and each team has different strengths.”
Despite its flawless record as it enters the MPSF Tournament, USC has not jumped out to the lead in every game this season. But head coach Lindsey Munday’s team embodies the spirit of its talismanic figure in goal. Johns’ mindset is the team’s mindset: Move on and play the next play.
“Whatever is coming next, you have to think about it one play at a time,” Johns said. “Whatever happens next, try and save the ball. Try and communicate together with your defense to make a stop.”
Johns’ equanimity in goal is no coincidence.
“I’m a creature of habit honestly. I’ve always been since I was younger in anything that I did, whether it be sports or everyday life. It’s something that honestly just sets my head and gets me in the zone of being ready to play,” Johns said.
With intimidating eye black and a cool head, Johns takes the field prepared for the inevitable twists and turns of a lacrosse game.
“It’s bringing that consistency factor to playing, just because there are so many unpredictable things in the game of lacrosse and in playing goalie that being able to have pregame rituals or superstitions or just things that I do every time before I play,” Johns said. “It just kind of puts me at ease and makes me know that all of those things are set. And from there, you kind of just take it, like I said, one play at a time.”
Yet even for someone as calculated as Johns, some pre-game routines are rather arbitrary.
“I’ve got a lot of superstitions and rituals. Some of them I can’t quite explain,” Johns said.
Off the field, Johns studies business administration at USC. As the daughter of two enterprising businesspeople, she has grown to love entrepreneurship.
“That world has always kind of intrigued me where you can kind of create your own destiny and create your own world and bring in all the elements that you like,” Johns said. “I hopefully want to start my own company or work for a startup.”
One of the most important traits an entrepreneur can have is trust. Whether it be trust in a vision or trust in the quality of a product or service, an entrepreneurial dream can become a reality when hard work and attention to detail meet fearlessness and creativity.
That sounds a whole lot like goaltending.

Falling forward · The football team wrapped up a drama-free spring offseason with their Spring Game at the Coliseum. USC will open their regular season play against defending national champion Alabama on Sept. 3. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
It’s been a quiet spring for USC football. Tame, relaxed, uneventful, I’d almost go so far as to say, boring.
With spring semester classes wrapping up, and with summer just around the corner, it’s finally time to really start thinking about football. The fact that USC football hasn’t been dominating the headlines the past couple of months might be a sign that hype going into next season isn’t quite at the level where it usually is. And to some degree, maybe this is indicative of the fact that this won’t be the best year of USC football in recent memory.
The relative lack of attention on the program so far is honestly a good sign if you ask me. Finally, the program is moving away from the expectation and pressure that for the last decade has only ended in underachievement and disappointment. This year, we’ll actually just get to see a group of guys playing football, and the rest will take care of itself.
When looking back on last season, it’s important to remember that beyond all the off-the-field, program leadership issues, the 2015 season was a small step forward, not backward for the program. Despite six losses during the campaign, the Trojans nonetheless officially won the Pac-12 South for the first time ever.
For the record, I still count the 2011 season — when the Trojans embarrassed UCLA with a 50-0 thrashing in the regular season finale, and the Trojans finished atop the Pac-12 South standings in the inaugural year of the Pac-12 conference championship game, but UCLA nonetheless got the invitation as the Pac-12 South representative due to USC’s postseason ineligibility — as the first time USC actually won the South division.
But for the following three seasons, USC fell short of a relatively doable expectation. UCLA represented the South the next season, then Arizona took the South crown in 2013 and 2014. It was an obvious sign that there was now competition not just on the North half of the conference with Stanford and Oregon, but also in our own backyard with UCLA and the Arizona schools.
So for USC to finally get back on that pedestal — a small, six-team pedestal, but still an important and competitive one — was an important step forward for the program, and something we Trojan fans should keep in perspective when thinking about the upcoming year.
Of course, there was plenty of drama surrounding the program last year. This year’s team won’t exactly be building off the same foundation that got to that Pac-12 South championship last year. As has been discussed plenty of times throughout this academic year, this will be Clay Helton’s first full season after his promotion from the interim head coach to the long-term program head.
The challenge of keeping a group of players motivated over the course of an entire season is certainly a different challenge than bringing a group of guys together in the middle of the season after some off-the-field drama. In fact, it might have even been easier for Helton to have gotten the team to rally around him through all the turmoil of the coaching uncertainties, especially if some of the players felt like they were playing to win him the job.
Now his task is to keep everyone not just committed, but also focused over an entire season. The hardest part for Helton might not be motivating everyone to get up to play Alabama. Anyone with a pulse will be pumped up going into that game. I’m already pumped up about the chance to bring down the defending national champions, and that game isn’t for another four-and-a-half months.
The true challenge is keeping everyone focused for the grueling conference slate, and making sure that the Trojans bring their A-game every game, not just for the big ones.
And so far, it seems like the Trojans are on the right track. Of course, it’s still way too early to make any real projections. We still don’t know for sure who will be the quarterback, what the rest of the competition will look like or how any of the new recruits will fare in their first year of college ball.
But the fact that we’ve already made it one semester without any real drama is a great sign. No players jumping into pools to rescue drowning family members, no overhyped recruiting class on signing day, no profanity-laced alumni dinner speech that made the headlines on both ESPN and Total Frat Move.
Granted, highly rated prospects aren’t a bad thing, and maybe the Trojans do need to get back on top in the recruiting game. But for now, the pressure is low, and the expectations are manageable.
Does this team have an upset against the Crimson Tide inside of it? Probably not, but looking at the overall season, that game is not that important. What matters is that the Trojans can stay focused, keep their eye on the prize all of the conference slate, try to make it back to the Pac-12 Championship and go from there. There will be plenty of hype to go around if and when Helton can get back there in his first season.

USC baseball dropped its single mid-week matchup with UC Irvine Tuesday 6-5 at Dedeaux Field as their season record dropped to 18-21. 
Though UC Irvine began the game with a 2-0 lead in the first inning, a well-executed offense from the Trojans tied the score immediately in the bottom of the inning. Lead off batter junior left fielder Corey Dempster walked to get on first base, stole second base, advanced to third base due to a ground out from David Oppenheimer and was able to cross home after another ground out from junior Jeremy Martinez. With the bases clear, the next batter, sophomore center fielder Timmy Robinson, tacked on the game-tying run with a monstrous solo home run to left field. 
While roughed up in the first inning, giving up two runs off four singles and a balk, freshman pitcher CJ. Stubbs recovered in the second inning in highlight-worthy fashion when he quickly adjusted to a wizzing line drive hit by John Brontsema right back at him, with a nifty catch and strut towards first base for the easy toss to the freshman Dillon Paulson for the third out. Stubbs would remain in the contest to throw three scoreless innings and permit only two more hits. 
The top of the batting lineup continued to be effective when USC took its first lead of the game in the bottom of the second inning after Robinson’s double to left field brought in Oppenheim and Dempster to give the Trojans a 4-2 lead.
USC added to its lead in the fourth inning when a double from Martinez to left center field scored Oppenheim. 
With a three score lead going into the fifth inning, head coach Dan Hubbs handed the ball off to reliever senior Brent Wheatley, who proved immediately effective in his sole inning of the game. 
But things did not work out so smoothly for the next USC pitcher, junior Andrew Wright, who, in the sixth inning. hit Jonathan Munoz and walked Grant Palmer. Though Wright was able get batter Adam Alcantara out on a fly ball to right field, Munoz to advance to third base and in position to score off an error by junior second baseman Frankie Rios. By the end of the inning, USC’s lead had been cut to 5-4. 
UC Irvine wasted no time completing its come back rally in the seventh inning, tying the game at 5-5 and taking its first lead of the contest since the first inning in what would turn out to be the game deciding score when Munoz hit an RBI single to left center field. 
In the ninth inning, senior pitcher Brooks Kriske did his part to give the Trojans offense the best chance to win, striking out two batters in a scoreless inning for UC Irvine. But despite getting two runners on base in their half of the ninth, the Trojans failed to drive in either to end the game.
USC will host Arizona in a pivotal three- game Pac-12 series beginning Thursday at Dedeaux Field.

It happens on every college campus: at a fraternity party, after a late-night study session or after a first date. Campus sexual assault is a reality many have to live with, even here at USC, where a recent study revealed that 29.7 percent of female undergraduate students have experienced sexual harassment or assault in some form.
Earlier this month, the stars of the harrowing campus sexual assault documentary, The Hunting Ground, released We Believe You, an anthology about the same topic. Annie E. Clark and Andrea L. Pino rose to activist fame when they, along with three other students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, filed a federal Title IX complaint against the university.
We Believe You tells the stories of students who were sexually assaulted on college campuses —  private, public, Ivy League, large and not-so-large. In 368 pages, 36 students of all ages, races and genders explain what they endured. The book is divided into six sections: “Before,” “How It Happened,” “Trauma and Betrayal,” “Healing and Everyday Activism”,” “Declaration of Independence” and “Rights and Resources”.
From the get-go, We Believe You established that it is not the usual story of sexual assault — if there ever was such a thing. The choice of the book’s title is particularly powerful. When it comes to sexual assault, the survivor is constantly doubted. Victims are typically  asked, “What were you wearing?” or “Are you sure it was rape?” or “Were you drunk?’” Clark and Pino are saying to their fellow survivors, “I got your back.” They are saying, “We believe you,” because it happened to them too.
Heartbreaking and heartwarming, We Believe You is not a story of hate, it’s a story of hope. Each survivor — Pino and Clark don’t call them victims — is fueled rather than impeded by what he or she endured. Remarkably, We Believe You also conveys a unique understanding of why sometimes healing takes a while.
Sari Rachel Forshner, whose story is included in the anthology, is a former USC student. “The Elegy of I” can be found in the “Before” and “Trauma and “Betrayal” sections, while “The After” is under “Healing and Everyday Activism.”
“My sophomore year at USC, I was drugged and raped in the middle of the road,” Forshner writes in “The Elegy of I.” Her tone is unflinching despite the horrors her words contain.
“I thought it was cut-and-dried. I thought I could decide how to handle it, that I could decide not to be a victim,” Forshner writes.
Forshner’s story is one of slowly learning to heal. In “The Elegy of I,” Forshner describes herself as “Laughter, lover, reader, actress, student.” After her assault, she loses touch with who she is. Like many survivors, the divide between before and after is sharp.
Forshner reconciles with herself in the poem “The After.”
“It used to feel like there was horror / in my DNA / I tried changing the colour of my hair; / I dyed it repeatedly, almost to the point / of destruction. I became a redhead, / but the roots still grew in raped,” she begins the poem. Once again, Forshner is fiercely unapologetic.
As the poem goes on, however, her tone softens. The shield cracks, and emotions pour through. She tells the reader, and herself, “I am so sorry, darling, but we cannot unknow what we know.” Forshner cycles through the stages of grief and healing, and almost ends up on the other side —not quite there yet, but slowly getting there.
The “Rights and Resources” section includes a list of websites and hotlines for survivors as well as a glossary, and more. “Help 101” instructs survivors about what should be done immediately after experiencing sexual violence, while “Why Didn’t You Go to the Police” explains why some survivors choose not to report their assault.
We Believe You is a great resource for those who wish to learn more about sexual assault on college campuses. More importantly, it is a lifeline for the survivors of sexual assault. It says to the survivors, “Me too. It happened to me too,” then takes them on a journey of learning to cope.

Omar Al Dakheel, a third-year graduate student in the USC School of Cinematic Arts, is an aspiring filmmaker. Between being an advocate for social justice and Muslim rights, he spends large amounts of time involved on campus as a resident assistant and filmmaker. The artist sat down with the Daily Trojan to share his passion for both film and Muslim rights and how he plans to pursue both of these interests through his work.
Daily Trojan: What kind of films have you made?
Omar Al Dakheel: I made short fictions and documentaries. My fiction was called The Trojan and its about an Iraqi-war-scarred refugee who hides behind a sports mascot to gain confidence and be accepted. And my documentary Jihad in Hollywood was about a Syrian refugee named Jihad who lost his acting career because of war in Syria and had to flee, now he is in Hollywood as a refugee trying to reinvent himself and renew his career.
DT: What do you aspire to do as a filmmaker?
OAD: All in the drama genre, which is what like most. I aspire to direct and produce films that tell accurate stories about people like me who are Arabs and Muslims. I think art is the best way to connect the gap between the East and West.
 
DT: How have your films been instrumental in providing dialogue for the Muslim community?
OAD: My films have not only opened a dialogue within the Muslim community but also with the Western audience. They connect all of us with common human denominators, which are to live for your potential, live in peace, prosperity, love and be loved, get treated with justice and respect.
DT: What inspires you about film?
OAD: It’s the best way to produce and preserve history. Films make me feel, and therefore inspire me to think, and therefore change and so evolve. And that’s how human beings should progress.
DT: What is your next project?
OAD: My next project is called Al Imam. It’s about one of the world’s few female imams that advocates for a reform within Islam that’s more egalitarian toward women and minorities.

I unexpectedly ran into one of my former professors in the halls a couple weeks ago, and just about pooped myself. I’m usually more composed when interacting with people I find attractive, but I still haven’t quite mastered running into someone who is not only unwittingly hot, but also brilliant, engaging and mind-blowingly influential. Something like 20 percent of my graduate school personal statement was derived from his class and I wasn’t even applying for the same field. He was so good at what he did — a quality that would make him attractive regardless of what he looked like — and the fact that he is also objectively good-looking made me glad I was wearing something that hid my sweat stains.
Ah, there’s nothing like a teacher crush. It makes any class, no matter what the subject, the most interesting thing in the world. I never fail to have at least one per semester, much to the benefit of my studies. Of course, there are the all-time greatest hits — my seventh grade science teacher who was so boyishly fine he made all the suburban moms giggle, or my senior year English teacher who taught with so much flippant charisma that he became everyone’s fantasy despite his stringy, feathered hair. But more generally, I think there’s something inherently attractive about professors that has kept me falling all over myself for academia from puberty on.
I’m not thinking of teaching as some kind of qualification for being a good parent. I’m not one to swoon over pictures of men with oodles of small nieces and nephews and quite frankly, I find children kind of strange and gelatinous. The attraction for me is more in the selection of a (sadly) pretty thankless profession simply due to one’s love of the material. The best teachers (and the most attractive) are the ones who put their heart and soul into their subject, who love it so much that they devote their lives to sharing it with others. If anyone looked at me like my eighth grade history teacher looked at The Iliad, I think I’d probably just die of happiness then and there.
The passion, that’s what gets me. The sheer love of learning and sharing what you’ve learned is something I identify with more and more as I become increasingly academically inclined. I’ve been blessed to have had many passionate teachers, both in high school and at USC. There’s something so intimate about mentorship, allowing someone more knowledgeable to incorporate their world view into the way you perceive reality, other people, the way you see yourself. And being able to impart life-changing information to someone else in return, isn’t that what the best romantic relationships do?
If you’re looking to fall in love in your own class schedule, I’d suggest looking into “Origins of the Mind,” “Ancient Epic” or “Narrative Forms in Literature and Film.” I won’t name any names or guarantee you’ll feel the same as I did (I recognize I have an acquired taste sometimes), but those teachers have a zeal for their subject that makes The Notebook seem like a passing fling. Hot or not, you’ll fall in love with the subject matter. Moving forward, I can only hope I can find something I love as much, so that I can pay that passion forward as they have.
I just got into my dream program for graduate school (many thanks to my beloved professors) and all I can think is how grateful I am to have been surrounded by so much academic love. That includes you, dear readers, and the Daily Trojan for letting me spew my verbose romantic anecdotes to the masses. It includes my amazing coworkers and campus job that catapulted me into the field I hope to pursue for the foreseeable future. It includes my parents and friends and mentors for putting up with my rambling semi-revelations and grasps at something meaningful in all this madness. Hell, that includes Los Angeles for being the madness, for being full of flowers and singing birds and crazy characters like an Art Spiegelman take on a Disney movie. There’s so much out there to love. Remember that.
Thanks for reading.

Students for Life of America have claimed that college campuses are the next abortion battleground, and they’re not wrong. Last month, the student government of UC Berkeley unanimously passed Resolution 69 urging its administration to make non-surgical medical abortion available to students on campus. Despite the federal legality of abortion established under the 1973 court case Roe v. Wade, abortions have been notoriously hard to come by in many parts of the nation, and the demands made by college students are indicative of a larger need for widespread abortion access beyond the average clinic.
The medical abortion method in question is a combination of two orally administered pills, Mifepristone and Misoprostol, which boast a success rate of up to 98 percent and a safety risk lower than Tylenol and Viagra and even giving birth. While this medical procedure is simple and effective in the first nine weeks of pregnancy, elective abortions in the United States have been sequestered into freestanding clinics rather than hospitals at large, due in no small part to anti-choice legislation. The claims made by the UC Berkeley students pushing the resolution show discontent with the current limited availability of abortion services, the distance of providers and the monetary cost shouldered by those seeking help, and also make a case for the expansion of services to university health centers as well as general hospitals.
When 44 percent of abortion seekers are ages 18 to 24 and only 1.3 percent of American universities offer medical abortions in their campus health centers, a supply and demand problem ensues. Unplanned pregnancy is also strongly correlated with dropout rates, especially for students in financial need and those attending community colleges. According to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, pregnancy prompts one in 10 dropouts among female community college students and 7 percent of dropouts among both men and women overall. Of all community college students who are unable to obtain an abortion or do not want one and carry their pregnancies to term, 61 percent do not graduate, and the vast majority of them who manage to stay enrolled take over six years to complete a bachelor’s degree. The ill effects of unplanned pregnancy in college are enough to warrant widespread abortion reform.
One of the obstacles to obtaining abortion services is the distance of clinics. The closest Planned Parenthood to UC Berkeley’s campus is almost four miles away, which makes for a long excursion for which students must sacrifice going to class. The distance issue is arguably the worst in Texas, the birthplace of Roe v. Wade, where clinics are few and far between and constantly facing threats of closure. Texas law requires women to make four separate clinic visits in order to obtain abortion pills. Since distance is a major factor in the outcome of unwanted pregnancies, allowing college campuses to distribute these drugs is only right, considering the busy college lifestyle and the unpredictability of clinic locations.
Another major disadvantage to keeping abortion services limited to specialized clinics is the constant danger patients and providers face from vocal opposition, namely in the form of picketing and anti-abortion violence. The National Abortion Federation has compiled a staggering list of attacks since the legalization of abortion more than 40 years ago; attackers have employed all types of methods from bombings and shootings to acid and anthrax exposure. If colleges tout their commitment to student safety — USC included — the vulnerability of their female students seeking clinic abortions should be a topic of grave concern. The threat of violence from reactionary terrorists can be circumvented by making discreet abortion services available to college students and eventually subsuming these services into hospitals in general.
For young women, especially those in college, the cost incurred when obtaining an abortion is a significant barrier. Planned Parenthood can charge up to $800 for the abortion pill, and even more for in-clinic vacuum aspiration procedures that occur after nine weeks of pregnancy. The more dangerous but cost-effective alternative to the clinic route is purchasing through online pharmacies — a simple Google search will yield results for Misoprostol tablets sold for as cheap as one dollar under the guise of being ulcer medication. Unfortunately, the legitimacy of these drugs is uncertain, and they may put patients’ lives in danger. The final price tag for off-campus abortions under the Cal health insurance comes out to $400, and USC’s own Aetna health insurance states that “services and supplies incurred for an abortion” remain uncovered. The close proximity of the Los Angeles Planned Parenthood clinic to USC’s campus is rendered useless when the ultimate cost is taken into consideration.
For reasons including convenience, safety and universally high prices of abortion services, Resolution 69 may be the first spark that ignites schoolwide pushes for abortion access everywhere. The fact that it was passed unanimously by a mixed-gender student government is even more significant, as it reflects the current college atmosphere of solidarity surrounding abortion access. If the bill is formally approved by the school’s administration, UC Berkeley could not only set a precedent for universities, but also hospitals and health centers in general, by mainstreaming abortion and integrating it into the gamut of medical services routinely and justly offered to patients.

Recently, the subject of paid parental leave has made headlines throughout the country. Earlier this month, San Francisco became the first U.S. city to require businesses to instate paid parental leave for their employees, offering six weeks of fully funded time off. New York joined the ranks of California, New Jersey and Rhode Island to mandate compensation for parents, also providing 12 weeks of partial reimbursement. Though these events mark immense strides on the paid family leave front, the advancements still pale in comparison with the policies in other developed countries. Given this momentum, the University should consider expanding its policies, setting a standard for paid family leave for employees of higher-level institutions.
On some level, USC deserves credit for its generous parental leave policies relative to the rest of the nation. Currently, the University offers 10 paid weeks of maternity leave, though the first week is a waiting period that requires the employee to use their sick days or vacation. Once that time is up, new mothers are given the option to take another 12 unpaid weeks off any time within their child’s first year.
Upon closer examination, however, even USC’s policies are insufficient. Because pregnancy qualifies as a disability, with health insurance, a basic plan would cover 70 percent of earnings for 10 weeks. Faculty, when approved by the Provost, would receive full compensation, but only for 10 weeks. For the remaining 12 weeks new parents are allowed off, however, the most California offers is 55 percent of the highest quarterly earnings. The remaining 45 percent can be extracted from other departments using sick or vacation days, but this compensation is not guaranteed.
USC fails to consider the immense time and resources it takes to raise a child. First, because all employees are promised only 10 weeks of compensation, many new parents feel the pressure to return to work to support their families financially. However, returning to work with such a rapid turnaround has had dire consequences. Last year, a 117-day-old infant entered his first day of daycare healthy and lively, but was found unresponsive at noon when his mother came from work to feed him. The cause of death was inconclusive, but the lack of attention from the daycare owner has raised questions.
Fatalities can be avoided with longer maternity leave, as a study by McGill University and UCLA found that with each additional month a woman is paid for parent leave, the chance for infant mortality decreases by 13 percent. Children need the one-on-one care from their parents, especially in the formative first few months of their lives. The present system, however, precludes new parents from spending time with their children even if they wanted to.
Additionally, an effective parental leave plan extends beyond just the promise of employment upon return and some compensation for time off. Supporting a family, especially with one new member, means maintaining rent or mortgage, making sure there’s food on the table, along with supplying resources associated with infant care, such as diapers, new clothes, bottles and more. Simply matching pay, in the best-case scenarios, is not enough to sustain an infant, much less a whole family.
The University should look to other countries that have the proper protections for new parents. Sweden started offering 12 months, partial pay in 1974. Since then, other amenities have been added to the policy. In addition, tech companies in the United States have reported policies on par with those of other developed nations. Netflix, for example, offers the most admirable parental leave package in the country, with 12 months paid leave. USC has countless examples to which they can look toward to develop their own policies.
Though many students at USC do not hold the responsibility of caring for a child, we are surrounded by employees and faculty members who are dedicated to their families in addition to enhancing our education. Should they decide to expand their families, they deserve the support of the University and the necessary and proper provisions.

The final papers and projects of the year are piling up, but freedom is almost here. Whether you’ll be impressing your boss at an internship this summer or working on your tan at the local pool, here are four apps to arm yourself with to have the coolest summer yet.
SkyGuide ($1.99, iOs)

Point SkyGuide to the skies and it’ll help you identify all the planets, constellations and satellites above at any time of day. The free app works even without Wi-Fi, data or GPS signal so make sure to download it before you head off into the wild for maximum wilderness appreciation.
Skillshare (Free classes or $10 Monthly membership, iOs)
Caitlin Tran | Daily Trojan
Keep yourself sharp, and enroll in classes on Skillshare this summer! This online platform has thousands of courses in design, photography, business and more. Their video modules are broken up into bite-sized lessons so you can learn at your own pace, and their site includes a classroom forum where you can interact with other students taking the course and showcase your take on the suggested projects. Last summer, I enjoyed this Pattern Design class and have my eye on an iPhone photography class to take next!
Everyday ($2.99, iOs)

The price tag may seem hefty for this photo-a-day app, but the simple design and interface is worth it. Everyday essentially will remind you to take a photo everyday for as long as you want and merges them into a timelapse with one tap. If you choose to use the front-facing camera, it’ll set up face guidelines for you so you can ensure you’re staying consistent in every subsequent frame. Additionally, you can set up multiple timelines, so you can have a sandwich-a-day series and an outside-my-window series. I’m planning to use Everyday as a visual diary for my summer.
inkHunter (Free, iOs)
Caitlin Tran | Daily Trojan
This one is a bit of a wild card, but too cool to leave out. If you’re feeling spontaneous this summer and start itching to get inked, consider using inkHunter to preview how your tattoo would look on your skin with augmented reality. You can try any of their preloaded tattoo designs or even upload your own black-and-white sketch for testing. Unfortunately, there’s no app to predict how you’ll feel about the ink in 10 years…
