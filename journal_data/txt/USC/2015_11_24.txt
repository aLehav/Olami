A small explosion occurred in Ronald Tutor Hall Tuesday evening due to an assistant research professor and his peers mixing chemicals. No one was hurt. 
The Los Angeles Fire department said the partners were conducting an organized experiment in the building’s basement laboratory. 
According to LAFD the building shook, but suffered no structural damage. 
No fire broke out from the accidental blast. 
Tutor Hall was evacuated and examined by a hazard task force and firefighters. Fire officials say the building only suffered minor flooding due to the reaction’s flash activating the automatic sprinkler system inside.

‘Tis the season! 

No, you’re not.

“Baby It’s Cold Outside” is the best part of Elf. 

No matter where you are. 

And the neighbors know it.

You’re considering making them into an advent calendar.

Ain’t nobody got time for the Top 100.

It happens to the best of us.

You probably have your own “Jingle Bell Rock” routine.

No one said it had to be good!

Christmas music knows no bounds.

Maybe we will get another Mariah Carey album?!

Changes the whole experience.

Are you even human?

Okay, and maybe that scene from Love Actually.

Some of us are just Christmas music obsessed. We can’t help it!

If you want to experience music in a new way, you should look to the App Store for some inspiration. These apps, which either allow you to create or consume music, can expand your horizons and connect you with your favorite tunes in ways you never thought of before. 
This is an app for adolescents (aren’t we all?) who wish to express themselves without having to use words. It was originally designed for those who have experienced loss, but it has come to apply to just about everyone. With six different moods to choose from and countless possible variations, you can create your own personal music journal that will accurately capture how you are feeling in a way that’s beyond words.
There are many music-making applications, but none are as encompassing as iMashine 2. It essentially allows you to create computer-generated tracks. At your disposal are 16 beat pads, a Smart Play keyboard (this makes sure that you are in key) and vocal recording and sampling capabilities. If you have an iPhone 6s or 6s Plus, you can manipulate beats through the iPhone pressure sensor. But if you don’t, you can still use the original iMashine, which has most of the other capabilities. You’ll be rapping to your beat in no time.
Yousician – rather than creating music — helps you learn an instrument. The app listens to you play through the phone microphone and gives you feedback — like Rock Band, but more intensive, so if you want to learn either piano or guitar, or don’t have time or money for a teacher, Yousician is a great alternative. It is free, but if you want unlimited time then you have to upgrade to premium, which is $19.99 per month.
Crossfader allows you to be your own DJ, and broadcast your music live across the world or at home alone. You don’t need to press anything though — the app responds to motions through the built-in gyroscope. There are three movements that the app recognizes — tilt, twist and swipe. For instance, to drop the bass, you tilt your phone. It’s user-friendly. The layout is similar to Instagram — you can create content in the middle of the bottom bar, see your notifications and follow other DJ’s.

All or nothing · This year, the annual rivalry game between the Trojans and the Bruins will decide the Pac-12 South champion. The winner will face Stanford in the Pac-12 championship game. – Maya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
In a game that will determine the Pac-12 South champion, the Trojans will host the rival Bruins in the regular season finale. Both teams are 5-3 in conference while the Bruins have one more non-conference win than the Trojans.
USC is coming into the matchup after a 48-28 loss to Oregon that snapped a four-game winning streak, while the No. 22 Bruins are coming off of a win against Utah in Salt Lake City.
Both USC and UCLA have no shortage of talent on the roster, but have struggled with consistency all season. The game will likely come down to which quarterback is able to control the game. USC will be led by redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler, a three-year starter who has never beaten UCLA. The Bruins, on the other hand, will be led by true freshman Josh Rosen, who has never played USC.
“We’ve got to have a mindset to come in Monday and be ready to go,” Kessler said. “We’re playing to win the South. Guys are going to be excited about that and it’s going to be a great week of preparation, but it definitely hurts with any loss.”
Kessler has sophomore JuJu Smith-Schuster in his corner, though he has battled various injuries all season Smith-Schuster has 68 receptions this season for 1,217 yards and 10 touchdowns. Though he is not at 100 percent, he is listed as probable for Saturday’s game.
“He’s a warrior. He’ll be fine,” Helton said. “He’s dealt with pain each and every week from Game 5 on. He’s one of those guys that shows up every week and gives it all he’s got.”
USC has also greatly utilized the run game under Helton, with the duo of Ronald Jones II and Justin Davis combining for most of USC’s yards on the ground. The Trojans will likely call on the pair a lot on Saturday, as UCLA’s rush defense is ranked No. 84 in the nation.
USC’s offense ranks 26th in the nation in points per game, while UCLA comes in at No. 41. On defense, UCLA has allowed 30 points in five of their last eight games. USC’s defense faltered last weekend as well, allowing a season-high 48 points against Oregon.
Rosen will lead a UCLA offense that has been without star running back Myles Jack nearly all season after he suffered a season-ending injury. The true freshman has completed 60 percent of his passes this season, throwing for 3,124 yards and 19 touchdowns. He’ll face a USC defense coming off of its worst game all season, allowing nearly 50 points against Oregon.
The annual rivalry game is always important, but this year it determines which team will face Stanford in the Pac-12 championship game and compete for a Rose Bowl berth.
“Even though it’s for the championship game and we’ve got ourselves to this position, just focus on doing your job would be the biggest thing I could tell our guys,” Helton said.
Kick off is set for 12:30 p.m. in the Coliseum.
The only way USC can win this game is to dominate the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball. The O and D lines must play smart, focused and mean spirited . They must want the win more than the other guy, otherwise, we lose.  Mora has instilled a level of toughness on his team that has not been seen at UCLA since Donahue. Our team must be bull dogs out there on the field this Saturday. That the ball and momentum away from Rosen. Period.

After adding two more road wins against the Arizona schools over the weekend, the No. 1-ranked USC women’s volleyball team will be looking forward to some home cooking this Thanksgiving week as they close out their conference schedule at home against crosstown rival UCLA and Cal.
The Women of Troy (29-1, 17-1) will be looking to notch their 30th win on the season on Wednesday evening against the No. 11-ranked Bruins (22-6, 13-5) at 8 p.m. in the Galen Center. Then, USC will honor seniors Samantha Bricio, Alicia Ogoms and Eve Ettinger when they take on Cal (9-20, 3-15) on Friday at 4 p.m. for Senior Night. The Women of Troy are a perfect 15-0 at the Galen Center this season.
During rivalry week, USC will look to come away victorious like they did in September when they swept the Bruins in Pauley Pavilion. In that    Pac-12 conference opener, USC was led by freshman outside hitter Alyse Ford who had 11 kills, while junior middle blocker Elise Ruddins added eight kills and four blocks to stop the Bruin offense.
Not much has changed in the Trojan lineup since then, as USC is still led by National Player of the Year candidate Samantha Bricio. The senior outside hitter leads the nation in points and aces per set and will look to add to her career kill total at USC when the Bruins come to Troy. Against Oregon State two weeks ago, Bricio became the school’s all-time kills leader with her 1,919th kill in the match, passing former All-American Alex Jupiter (2008-11). After a combined 47-kill effort this past weekend against No. 23 Arizona and No. 24 Arizona State, Bricio also moved into seventh all-time in Pac-12 history for kills (1,966).
USC has also jumped back to the top of the AVCA National Rankings thanks to the play of freshman setter Baylee Johnson. The Dayton, Ohio, native produced her team-leading 15th double-double of the year against ASU and recorded a total of 61 assists, 20 digs, seven blocks and seven kills on the weekend. Those strong contributions resulted in Johnson being named Pac-12 Freshman of the Week, the first weekly award of her young career.
Overall, USC leads both of the all-time series against UCLA and Cal. Against the Bruins, the Women of Troy have a 56-49 edge all-time, but have split the last ten matches against UCLA. The match on Wednesday will be the 106th meeting all-time between the crosstown rivals. Against the Golden Bears, USC holds the 53-12 advantage all-time, while also winning eight of the last 10 meetings. In addition, the match on Friday will be the first meeting between the Trojans and the Golden Bears this season. These matches will mark the end of Pac-12 conference play for head coach Mick Haley and the Women of Troy, and both matches will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks.

Do it for the seniors” is a common theme in locker rooms, but never has it been more relevant than this weekend. If USC doesn’t beat UCLA on Saturday, the seniors on the team will graduate having never won a game against their crosstown rivals. For a school that prides itself on being a national football powerhouse, that can’t happen.
“Do it for Helton” has been a driving force for the team since the interim head coach took over, and after last week’s loss to Oregon, a loss to UCLA would just about ensure that Helton is not the head coach next year. Helton has been coaching for his job all season, and has managed to keep his team in contention for a Pac-12 South title, and his season now comes down to one game.
It’s merely a coincidence that the game deciding the Pac-12 South has come down to the annual rivalry game against UCLA. That game is the most anticipated every season, especially in recent years as a result of UCLA’s success. Though beating the Bruins used to be routine, the Trojans haven’t won the rivalry game in three years. It’s important every season, as every win counts, but the Trojans’ entire season and the future of Helton is riding on this game.
The two losses the Trojans have suffered under Helton have been to ranked teams, with Notre Dame currently coming in at No. 4 with its only loss of the season coming from No. 1 Clemson. Last weekend’s loss at Oregon was disappointing, but Oregon is better than its 8-3 record, as quarterback Vernon Adams missed time due to injury, but the Ducks have looked unstoppable since his return.
The expectations are so high at USC that two losses, even if they are at the hands of ranked teams, makes it hard to make a case for the head coaching job. That being said, it’s also hard to argue with a Pac-12 South title. And if Helton is able to beat the Pac-12 North champion and earn a Rose Bowl berth, it’d be hard to overlook him.
It’s also an important game for redshirt senior Cody Kessler. Kessler has lost to former UCLA quarterback Brett Hundley the past two seasons but will now face true freshman Josh Rosen. Kessler began the season as a Heisman candidate but has not played to his potential this year. At the end of the day, though, all of that can be forgiven with a win over UCLA. I think in a way, Kessler’s legacy is on the line. It will be the final home game of his USC career, and the way he plays against a true freshman will be the way his career is remembered.
The most important thing about this game is that it determines the Pac-12 South champion. But for many Trojans — Kessler, Helton and the seniors — it is so much more than that. Legacies will be cemented and futures determined.

The USC men’s basketball team continued their hot start to the season with a 96-61 victory over the visiting Cal State University, Northridge Matadors (2-3). Ten different players scored for the Trojans as the team dominated from start to finish.
The Trojans exploded out the gate en route to an early 17-5 lead. Behind some great ball movement and hot shooting from beyond the three-point line, the Trojans increased their lead to as much as 26 points in the first half.
Both guard Jordan McLaughlin and forward Katin Reinhardt started the game a perfect 3-3 from beyond the arc. As a team, the Trojans shot 53 percent from three in the first half.
The Matadors, who only played seven players, struggled to keep up with the size and speed of the Trojan offense. USC out rebounded the Matadors 25-16 in the first half and assisted on their first 11 shots to start the game. The Trojans took a 46-26 lead into the half.
Things didn’t get any better for the Matadors in the second half as the Trojans continued to put on an offensive clinic. The Trojans’ hot shooting carried over to the second half as the team pushed their lead to as much as 35 points.
Jason Richardson led the Matadors with 18 points on 7-18 shooting. The Matadors struggled as a team from the field, shooting just 36.8 percent for the game, while going 1-13 from downtown.
After starting last season 1-3, the Trojans seem much more poised and comfortable with each other. The Trojans have now scored more than 80 points in all four games this season, a feat they only accomplished eight times last season. It appears that head coach Andy Enfield finally has all pieces together for his space and pace offense.
“We emphasize playing team basketball,” Reinhardt said. “If someone’s open make the extra pass. That’s how good team win.”
McLaughlin led all scorers with 20 points on 70 percent shooting and Reinhardt chipped in 17 points off the bench for the Trojans. Fellow guard Julian Jacobs flirted with a triple double, finishing with six points, 10 assists and 11 rebounds.
“I think our entire guard rotation has played at a high level,” Enfield said. “We’re sharing the basketball. We had 26 assists tonight, and we’re hitting open shots.”
Freshman Bennie Boatwright continued to show why he was a top recruit out of high school as he finished with 12 points and six rebounds. Fellow freshman Chimezie Metu finished with five points, five rebounds and three blocks. Metu is now averaging 3.75 blocks per game on the season.
The Trojans finished with 26 assists on 37 made baskets. The Trojans also out-rebounded the Matadors 57-34 en route to 25 second chance points.
The Trojans will now head to Orlando, Florida, to take part in the AdvoCare Invitational. USC will face their toughest challenge of the young season against No. 20 Wichita State on Thursday. The game will be aired on ESPN at 11 a.m.

While USC has been in the spotlight all season in the wake of former head coach Steve Sarkisian’s firing and its comeback in the second half of the season under interim head coach Clay Helton, one Trojan has quietly looked on from the sidelines patiently waiting for his turn. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Max Browne has spent the past three years preparing to assume redshirt senior Cody Kessler’s role as starting quarterback.
The Sammamish, Washington, native graduated from Skyline High School in December 2012, a semester early, and immediately enrolled in classes and began participating in spring practices. Browne initially battled Kessler for the starting job before Kessler ultimately won, forcing Browne to sit behind him for two seasons. The experience was not lost on Browne, however, as he has used the past two years to learn from his predecessor.
“I think the biggest thing I’ve learned from him and the whole process is just competing with him,” Browne said. “There were two springs where I was battling for the starting job with him. You learn a lot about yourself when things don’t go your way. I’ve kind of been able to sit back and see how he approaches the game and everyday reps which has been good to learn from. I think competing with him head on and learning more about myself is probably the biggest thing.”
If Browne has managed to fly under the radar so far at USC, he’ll be thrust into the spotlight when he makes his debut as starting quarterback next season against Alabama and its offensive coordinator, former USC head coach Lane Kiffin.
“As far as playing my old coach, I think it’ll be a little odd looking across the sidelines and knowing that that’s the guy that I came to college to play for, but it’s not gonna be anything personal or anything like that,” Browne said. “I just think it’s just a big game in general. It’s two huge national powers, and I’m sure it’ll be a huge driving force for our whole team this offseason. I’m excited and can’t wait.”
Browne has played under three head coaches since Kiffin in as many years at USC. Despite the head coaching duties changing hands so many times, Helton has been a consistent presence for Browne and has helped him adjust to the coaching changes.
“It’s affected everyone on the team a lot just because it’s been kind of a carousel, but for me personally, it’s been nice that Helton has stayed here the whole time,” Browne said. “He’s the guy that recruited me. That’s stayed consistent for me, which has been nice, especially since quarterback is such a high pressure position.”
Despite a loss at Oregon last weekend, Browne is hopeful that the team can close the regular season with a win over UCLA and capture a Pac-12 title, possibly removing the interim tag from Helton’s title.
“I hope we can finish these last few weeks out the right way,” Browne said.
Regardless of who is head coach next season, Browne will spend the offseason preparing to lead his team. He has set his sights on bringing a national championship back to USC.
“It’s bold, but I think that’s the bar we set — and with all the talent we have on our team and the recruiting classes we’ve had and the coaches — I think it’s there,” Browne said. “We’ve shown these past few weeks under Helton that we can play with anyone, and it’s just a matter of not losing focus and staying the course.”
The coaching staff took notice of Browne’s dedication and work ethic last season, awarding him the Lifter of the Year Award.
“That was awesome,” Browne said. “That’s probably what I’m most proud of since I got to USC just because it was nice having the coaches see the work you put in, especially when things may not have gone my way early on. One thing I’ve always hung my hat on is work ethic and showing up each and everyday and doing what I need to do so getting that award was awesome.”
Browne’s work ethic isn’t exclusive to football, however. He is completing his final semester of undergraduate study, and will graduate in December with a degree in communication with a minor in entrepreneurship. He plans to attend graduate school over the next two years and pursue an MBA. In fact, academics played a strong role in anchoring the quarterback to USC even after he learned he’d be spending two years as a back-up.
“I knew this scenario was a possibility when I signed here, but all in all, it’s been awesome,” Browne said. “School has been great, I have a great group of friends and a great group of teammates so [transferring] never was in consideration.”
Though the season is winding down, it’s only the beginning for Browne. His days of looking on from the sidelines are coming to a close, and come next season, he’ll be the one calling the plays for the Trojans.
“I wouldn’t say I’m afraid or anxious or worried but the expectations are sky high,” Browne said. “I think that’s something you get up for and you’re excited about but it’s just different being the back-up guy to suddenly you’re in the spotlight. You’re on a national stage right from the get-go, which is awesome and that’s why you come here.”
What a classy young man. His parents must be very proud. He has only been positive, we’ve never heard a negative word or complaint. I thought there should have been games where he played even when the game was still in doubt. Last year they should have let him come in and throw the ball instead of every play just handing off.
Go, Max.
Max, you must be ready to play and lead this team to victory now, not next season. You’ve had 3 years in the program as a QB. Kessler could get hurt, and we’re down 14 points, in the 4th Q. Are you emotinally, intellectually and physically ready?

Many students and alumni are united by the bonds of the Trojan Family. For redshirt sophomore tight end Connor Spears, the cardinal and gold runs deep. After playing a year at Columbia University, Spears followed family ties to USC.
“I wasn’t enjoying the football aspect of Columbia as much as I was hoping,” Spears said. “My sister went to school out here, so I got to be here for her last year here. I really had just wanted to go to USC my whole life. I was always coming to games and spent a lot of time here. My grandpa taught in the medical school for 35 years, and my great grandpa went here, too, so I kind of have it in my blood.”
For Spears, football has always been a way for him to connect many aspects of his life. After spending the early years of his life in San Diego, Spears moved to Iowa before his freshman year of high school.
“I played football growing up — I played a couple years in middle school — but I really got started freshman year as a way to meet people since I had just moved to Iowa,” Spears said. “Football gave me that bridge to get to know my new classmates and I just fell in love with it sophomore year. That’s when I decided I was going to make it a goal to play college ball.”
Spears began his football career as a quarterback, a fitting position for his 6-foot-6 frame, but decided he enjoyed being on the receiving end more and switched to tight end.
“I played quarterback in middle school, but I really liked playing receiver and realized I wasn’t fast enough to be a receiver,” Spears said. “So, I figured I should just try to put on some weight and try to figure out how to block, so tight end kind of fit that role perfectly.”
Once Spears started playing high school football, he made it a goal to play college ball. Spears attended Bishop Heelan High School in Sioux City, Iowa. He was an All-District tight end his junior and senior seasons and earned All-State second team honors his senior season. His success on the field resulted in offers from Columbia, Cornell, Yale and Northern Iowa.
“Recruiting is pretty sparse at my high school; we don’t have a whole lot of guys shipping out,” he said. “I took an official to Cornell and Columbia and then committed to Columbia early February of my senior year. Going to Columbia gave me the opportunity to really get a good education and play football so I thought that’s where I was gonna end up.”
Spears’s father and grandfather both swam at Dartmouth, so Spears felt it was natural to continue the Ivy League tradition. Spears is a business administration major with a B-plus average.
“My parents always stressed the importance of academics and how far that’s taken both of them in their lives, so I knew when I was going to go to college it was going to be to improve my education and get the best degree possible. Football gave me an opportunity to really pursue that,” Spears said.
Spears played one season at Columbia before deciding to change schools. He reached out to wide receivers coach Tee Martin, who offered him a preferred walk-on spot, which he accepted almost immediately. Per NCAA rules, Spears was forced to sit out last season because he transferred, but said the year spent on the sidelines improved his game.
“Sitting out gave me a really good opportunity to learn from the older guys, and I was able to watch them and see how they worked,” Spears said. “It also gave me a chance to really focus on school and get bigger. I actually put on 25 pounds that season. Being ineligible was a bummer, but it definitely made me a better player because of it.”
The tight end’s first eligible season got off to a less than ideal start when former head coach Steve Sarkisian was fired after the Washington game. Spears isn’t letting it get to him, though, and insists that the team has come together and rallied around interim head coach Clay Helton.
“At the end of the day, it’s just about what happens on Saturdays,” Spears said. “The beginning of the year wasn’t ideal, but we’re sticking together and trying to make it happen. We love Helton, and he’s done a great job of keeping us together. It’s tough, but it happens. You just have to deal with it and win games.”
Spears is so much in support of his coach, in fact, that he is hoping to see Helton named the next head coach at USC.
“We’re all in support of him,” Spears said. “He’s done a great job of taking the situation and turning it around and I don’t think we’ve been closer as a team since I’ve been here. I would love for him to get the job. I think he would be a terrific coach, and he would really thrive in that position.”
In the face of adversity, the Trojans are one win away from claiming the Pac-12 South. Spears and the Trojans will face the Bruins on Saturday in the regular season finale with the Pac-12 race on the line.
“Knowing that we’re up against a wall and it’s us against the world at this point, we know we have each other, but there’s not a whole lot of support coming from elsewhere,” Spears said. “We know we have to stick together if we want to win games. We know what we have to do and just stay together.”
As for Spears, he’s ready to be called on at any moment.
“I always prepare like I’m going to be the guy that week,” Spears said. “You just have to be ready to go because that’s the game of football. You just have to be ready for the opportunity when it’s there.”
Has Spears even caught a pass this season?  And if he had a chance to go to Yale, why did he pick a loser school like Columbia?
