Family A-Fair, a USC student-run organization, hosted its first Community Health Fair on Sunday at the St. Raphael School, four miles south of USC’s University Park campus.
The fair provided comprehensive health services and educational resources to the underserved population living in the local area.
President and co-founder Ellie Volpicelli helped organize the event. Volpicelli is a post-baccalaureate pre-med student at USC who has a strong interest in community outreach.
“The goal of the health fair is firstly to spread health awareness and second to connect community members to nonprofits and community organizations which are health-related,” Volpicelli said.
The event, which served approximately 500 people, was particularly impactful because the school is in an underprivileged location and matches Volpicelli and the other founder’s hope to reach out to the underserved communities around USC for future health fairs.
“Ninety percent of this school’s student population is at or below the poverty line, which is why this fair is so important,” Volpicelli said. “We are reaching out to people who are uninsured, underinsured or don’t have access to adequate care.”
St. Raphael High School Principal Barbara Curtis oversees the students who attend the school and echoed similar thoughts about the struggles they face.
“A lot of our families do not take care of themselves because they don’t have the time or the money, so there is a great reliance on volunteer groups like Family A-fair because of the lack of resources allotted to the community,” Curtis said. “Events like these raise awareness and they’re great for parents and kids.”
Seventeen organizations attended the fair, several of which were from USC. The USC organizations were Vision for Vision and USC Science Outreach. Other organizations included Whole Foods, Valley Breast Center, YMCA and more.
USC Science Outreach is a student-run organization that conducts weekly science experiments for students at three different elementary schools near USC.
At the fair, members of the club conducted science experiments for children, including DNA extraction from strawberries and the creation of Oobleck, a non-Newtonian fluid.
USC Science Outreach member Rylee Epperson, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering, demonstrated how to separate DNA in strawberries to a group of elementary school students.
“Our club seeks to pique an interest for science in the kids and help them gain some passion for science,” Epperson said.
Eric Flowers, a junior majoring in computer science games, remarked on the importance of outreach programs in underserved communities.
“A critical part of the club is that USC is such a reputable university surrounded by underprivileged schools where we can share our passion or knowledge,” Flowers said. “We hope to make the kids exposed to the excitement of science, because even if they don’t remember what we teach them, we hope they remember the excitement they felt when we showed them the experiments.”
Tatiana Sosa, a member of the school’s parent board and whose two children attend St. Raphael, loved the educational programs for her children.
“It’s an awesome event because it gives families access to help and services they otherwise wouldn’t get, and because it engages the whole family,” Sosa said. “My kids visited the USC Science Outreach table and I know they definitely learned something from it.”
Co-founder David Velasquez, a junior studying human biology, says that the name of the organization, Family A-Fair, was created to emphasize this same concept.
“We wanted our name to represent our holistic approach to serving the community,” Velasquez said. “We want everyone in the families involved — grandparents, babies and more.”
Volpicelli and other members of Family A-fair are already planning for their next fair, which they plan to host next fall. They hope to host more USC student organizations and get more funding.
Co-founder Jackie Schwerdt, who is also a post-baccalaureate pre-med student, organized the funding for this fair, which was obtained outside of the University.
“We hope to get internal USC funding for our next fair, as we were denied this time,” Schwerdt said. “Our funding was all through individual donations and the sponsorship of organizations such as Whole Foods and St. Raphael School itself, which provided food for the event.”
The organization hopes future events will attract more people and raise greater awareness for health promotion and disease prevention in underserved populations.

The 22-year-old man found dead Tuesday has been identified as Jonathan Bisignano, a senior international relations (global economy) major, according to a statement from Dani Byrd, interim dean of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, on Friday.
Bisignano, who is from Palos Verdes Estates, California, was found dead at 2:25 p.m. in 30th Street Court Apartments by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Department of Public Safety. DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said the cause of death was initially reported as accidental overdose but is yet to be confirmed by the L.A. County Coroner.
A member of the Zeta Delta chapter of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity, Bisignano was also a member of the Trojan Investing Society and was working as an investment banking analyst for Harbor Ridge Capital, LLC. He was described as a “sharp and thoughtful student, as well as a friend to many” by Byrd in the statement.
Bisignano is survived by his parents, Angela and Gerard, as well as his brother, David. Memorial services have not yet been announced.
UPDATE:
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Gerard Bisignano said that his son had a hereditary heart condition and died in his sleep from heart failure. Gerard Bisignano said that he spoke with the coroner’s investigator and that no drug paraphernalia was found at the scene.
“Jonathan was known as a caring, smart and ambitious man,” Gerard Bisignano said.

USC Model United Nations held the closing ceremony for its annual Model UN conference for high school students Sunday. The conference, known as SCMUN, opened on Friday evening, and kicked off a full schedule of debate, problem solving and collaboration surrounding simulated situations in international affairs.
During the conference, participants represented a country and formed a resolution group with other countries to meet their combined interests on a certain topic and determine future course of action following days of debating. Sophomore Alex Melnik, secretary-general of the conference, studying international relations and policy, planning and development, said the range of situations is wide and not limited to current affairs.
“We have a mix of historical, contemporary and futuristic committees,” Melnik said. “For example, in terms of a future committee we have a committee that takes place in the year 2022 when the Winter Olympics are hosted in China, and the scenario is that Tibet is looking to secede from China.”
Sophomore Shelley Dai, chief executive of the conference, said the event was a great success given the turnout.
“We managed to grow this conference, I think, 133 percent from the last year, so it’s really high growth, and we’re looking forward to next year maybe getting 350 to 400 delegates,” Melnik said.
Conference participation helps run the club’s operations. In addition to events for high school students, the club also sends delegates to compete in conferences around the country. Given the travel involved, participation in these competitions can be a large expense to bear without help.
“Generally for conferences, we’ll have to stay in a hotel, and we have registration fees as well, but for the past few we’ve been able to subsidize all the spots we offered which is great, meaning that no matter your financial status, you’ll be able to go to a conference,” Dai said.
The club has been very successful in these conferences recently.
“We recently went to LAMUN, which is UCLA’s Model UN conference, and received a lot of different awards including the ‘best small delegation’ award, so we’re a very competitive team,” Melnik said.
The club prides itself not only on competing in competitions but also on outreach efforts. The club launched a new program in partnership with the City of Los Angeles and their Youth Ambassadors program to bring Model UN to new high schools. The program provides 14 children an opportunity to learn about debate in Model UN as well as scholarships to attend a conference. Programs like these fit into the club’s guiding objective of helping others through Model UN.
“Our main message throughout the club has been aiding others as the model United Nations,” Dai said. “We want to make sure these high schoolers and middle schoolers have a focus on nonprofits, which we’re both very involved in as well as a general message of helping out.”
Getting involved in the club is fairly easy to do and doesn’t require any prior experience. Right now, the club has members from a wide range of academic backgrounds.
“We have premed, engineering and computer science [students.] Part of the club has a training aspect to it, so people who have never done Model U.N. before will learn about public speaking, and about procedures, as well as just how to debate,” Melnik said.
Dai spoke about the club’s transition from primarily seniors in leadership positions, to younger members taking over.
“It’s been really interesting having this quick turnover from the seniors to the sophomores and having a young club trying to regain experience on our own,” Dai said. “Those are definitely some challenges we’ve been facing, but it means that we’ll have a lot of continuity as our club continues on.”

Sarah Weingust grew up in Berkeley and Boston,  completed high school in Oregon and ended up at USC, while Meir Razzon grew up in Istanbul before moving to Los Angeles. Now these students are using their travel experiences to create an app that aids the world traveler in finding a secure location fast.
Weingust, a senior majoring in psychology, is the CEO and co-founder of HostelPass.  She was inspired to create this app after studying abroad her junior year in London.
“I was able to really see the world — it just widened my perspective, and I felt like this was an experience everyone should have,” Weingust said. “But there was something missing from it, which was the ability to be spontaneous and not have to plan everything really far in advance. That’s where HostelPass came in. It just really derived from a pain I was having while I was traveling.”
Upon her return from London she shared her idea with her roommate, Razzon, a senior majoring in industrial systems engineering, is now chief operating officer and co-founder of HostelPass.
HostelPass allows travelers to pre-pay for a pass for the length of time they want accommodation in Europe. The pass charges $50 per night and after 10 nights the traveler gets one extra night free.
The reservation can be made anywhere from months in advance to the date of departure. Upon downloading the app the user creates a profile and subsequently is matched with the top hostels best suited to the person’s preferred characteristics.
The app is currently set up for bookings in 10 different European cities: Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Budapest, Dublin, London, Lisbon, Paris, Prague and Rome. They are working with around 225 hostels, some part of the largest hostel chains in all of Europe.
“The main objective was to get people to spend less time planning and more time exploring,” Weingust said. “We also wanted to liberate the free-spirited traveler to just be able to experience Europe in the way that they want to and not feel tied down.”
After creating HostelPass, Weingust and Razzon started by testing it manually with friends, entering pitch competitions and joining the Viterbi Incubation Program.
The two students have been working on the app for around six months. They are currently one of the top six finalists for the New Venture Seed Competition put on by the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies.
The app also aims to provide its users with more culturally enriching experiences by partnering with different tourist companies that provide activities from walking tours to pub crawls. They hope to expand the app to even more European cities and eventually extend to different continents such as Asia and South America.
“We want it to be the trusted source of hostel bookings,” Weingust said.
Weingust and Razzon expect to complete the development process by the end of April and begin beta testing May 10. The app’s tentative launch date is Sept. 15.
“It’s awesome just to do something in the travel space because it’s something that I’ve always been interested in, but I never expressed it or even knew it, but once I started doing this, I realized how cool it is,” Razzon said.
Although the app has not been released yet, Weingust is proud of what she and Razzon have already accomplished in what she feels is male-dominated field.
“Being able to achieve this has meant a lot in terms of being a woman. I think that the business space is so dominated by men, and it’s been really cool to stand equally and even excel in that field and not feel like I’m being treated any differently,” Weingust said.

The No. 5 women’s lacrosse team finished its 2016 regular season on a high note, defeating UC Davis 14-4 during Sunday’s Senior Day. With a 17-0 record, the Trojans are continuing to make program history, and their journey does not end here. Instrumental in the team’s success have been the seniors who have served as role models, building the team from the ground up.
“It feels great,” head coach Lindsey Munday said. “We’ve really just been trying to go one game at a time and not be thinking about the season as a whole. But today in general was so special to cap off this regular season with the seniors and to go out this way, it’s just really coming full circle.”
The Trojan roster features 14 seniors and today, each and every one of them contributed to the team dynamic and chemistry, which propelled USC to its 17th victory of a historic season.
For senior defender Courtney Tarleton, today marked her first shot of her four year career, which resulted in her first goal.
“Everyone always pressures me to take a shot and I’ve never taken a shot before until this game so it feels really good to have a goal finally,” Tarleton said.
Tarleton has been a crucial component of the Trojan defense and led the team by example.
“She’s been an incredible leader and an incredible person. It’s really special for her to be able to end with a goal,” Munday said.
The Trojans’ success this season can be attributed to the depth that the team has on both ends of the field and the joint effort that goes into each and every play.
“The reason why we’ve been so successful this year is that it’s everybody and that’s what’s so special,” Munday said. “To cap it off this way for this group is just really special, I’m just so proud of them.”
The win finished off a strong weekend for the Women of Troy.
On Friday, the Trojans survived a late comeback attempt by No. 9 Stanford for a 10-9 victory in a game played at the Coliseum.
Holding a 10-3 lead in the second half, the Women of Troy allowed 6 straight goals, watching their lead get trimmed to just 1 with three minutes to play. But the Trojans swarmed the Cardinal on defense, forcing a turnover and hanging on to the ball in the final minute to close out the win.
Munday credited the stellar defense down the stretch to preparation in practice.
“This whole preseason, we did a really good job battling and really pushing one another in practice,” Munday said. “We’re battling, we’re competing. It’s just a mentality piece in that last minute to stay confident, stay true to what we’re doing and take care of the ball in the end.”
Junior attacker Michaela Michael finished with 4 goals and two assists to lead the way, the 24th time in her career that she’s finished with 3 or more goals. Her last goal capped off a 4-0 run to end the first half for the Trojans, extending a 1-goal lead to 5 at halftime.
Turnovers, though, let the Cardinal back in the game.
“It allowed [the Cardinal] to get a lot of looks offensively. We just need to take care of the ball a little bit more,” Munday said.
Stanford outshot USC 11-5 in the second half, but the Women of Troy ultimately hung on to stay undefeated.
“It’s just awesome to play in the Coliseum,” Munday said. “It’s such a special place. There’s so much tradition here. We started our program in the Coliseum — our very first game was here — so to send the seniors out this week in the Coliseum in the win was pretty special.”
The Trojans will prepare for the MPSF Tournament, which begins Friday in Stanford.

The baseball team traveled to Pullman this weekend to take on Washington State, hoping to bounce back after being swept last weekend by Oregon. Riding the momentum of a midweek win over Long Beach State, the Trojans combined stifling pitching and timely hitting to take two out of three games against the Cougars.
Redshirt junior Joe Navilhon drew the start for the series opener, and the right-hander turned in another solid performance since joining USC’s starting rotation. Navilhon tossed four innings of 2-run ball in a rain-shortened outing before making way for the bullpen after an hour-long delay. The Trojan bats managed to plate 2 runs before lightning stopped play, thanks to two RBI groundouts from seniors Timmy Robinson and David Oppenheim.
Junior Bernardo Flores entered in place of Navilhon when the game resumed, and he kicked off a shutdown night for the USC relief corps. The lefty continued his renaissance out of the bullpen, pitching three scoreless innings. Junior Jeff Paschke came in for the eighth and ninth innings, keeping the game knotted at 2-2 with two more innings of shutout Trojan relief.
USC finally broke the deadlock in the tenth, as senior AJ Ramirez lifted a sacrifice fly to score the go-ahead run. Freshman Dillon Paulson then drove in an insurance run with a RBI single to stake senior closer Brooks Kriske a 2-run lead for the bottom of the inning. Kriske breezed through a perfect tenth, clinching the series-opening win and his sixth save of the season.
Senior Kyle Davis toed the rubber on Saturday, and he continued the Trojans’ excellent pitching during the series. The veteran gave the bullpen a rest with eight masterful innings, fanning nine while giving up just 1 run on three hits.
USC’s offense smacked 3 home runs in support of Davis. Paulson went yard for the first time in his collegiate career to break a 1-1 deadlock in the top of the sixth, pulling a 2-run shot to right field. Ramirez and junior Jeremy Martinez also homered, and the Trojan bats opened a 5-run lead going into the bottom of the ninth. Senior Marc Huberman gave up 1 run but struck out two in the final inning to nail down the series win.
The Trojans faltered on Sunday, though, falling 9-2 in a blowout. Sophomore Mitch Hart struggled in three innings of work, giving up 5 runs. Three more runs for Washington State in the seventh gave the Cougars a 9-1 advantage.
The Trojans’ record sits at 18-20, with a 7-8 clip in conference play after the weekend. They are now 6-11 on the road.
Next up for USC is a seven-game home stand, beginning with a midweek tilt against UC Irvine on Tuesday. The Trojans then welcome Arizona to Dedeaux Field over the weekend, as they look to continue their climb up the Pac-12 standings.

After the 2005 USC football team lost the national championship to Texas in a stunning fashion, I was heartbroken. Then after a few days, I was fine. I had convinced myself that since it seemed USC contended for the national title every year under former head coach Pete Carroll, they would just win next year.
My young naiveté and limited sample size of Trojan fandom contributed to this incredible misguided assumption. More than 10 years later, USC still hasn’t been back to a national title. That loss to Texas led to the slow decline of the Trojan football program.
At first it was gradual, shifting from national championships to Rose Bowls. Under quarterbacks John David Booty and Mark Sanchez, USC was still the team no one wanted to play at the end of the year. Each season had the same narrative. If only one or two plays had gone just a little bit differently, USC would be playing for it all. That was the first step down.
Then Sanchez left a year earlier than expected, and Matt Barkley was thrust into the starting role as a true freshman. That was the next step down. The team went from being one or two plays away from reaching a national championship appearance to being eight or nine plays away from winning 10 games. They went from beating Oregon and Stanford to getting dominated.
Then the sanctions hit, Carroll left, and Lane Kiffin came, and the slide toward mediocrity and eight and nine-win seasons continued. With the exception of Barkley’s ridiculously impressive second half of his junior season and the magic of Eddy O’s brief tenure as interim coach, USC has been stuck in a slog of above-average but not phenomenal performances for six years.
The play can be ascribed to the toll sanctions took on the roster’s depth, to questionable coaching hires, or to an array of other reasons. Whatever the case may be, it is clear 10 years later that greatness isn’t just sustained. It takes elite performers at every level from the coaching staff down.
In 2006, I would have been shocked if I had been told in my three years on campus, USC would have had four head coaches in the football program and not played in one Rose Bowl. Now it seems commonplace, but it shouldn’t.
I’m not holding out hope that USC somehow wins a national title next year. If they can get through the beast that is their first four games relatively unscathed, I think they could play for the Pac-12 title, but not the four team playoff. I’ve held out such optimism every year, but for some reason this season seems different.
Sure, there are question marks on the defensive line and possibly the secondary, but this coaching staff seems to know what they are doing. They are experienced, and led by a head coach in Clay Helton who connects with the players on a level the last two coaches did not.
Three years down at USC, and the football team hasn’t yet approached the woefully misguided expectations I held out 10 years ago. However, with a new staff in place and two incredible quarterback options to choose from, I am hoping that next year is the start of the next run of sustained greatness.
The team has a plan for recruiting, developing and executing. That is markedly different than what seemed to be a haphazard approach for portions of the last three seasons.
Helton doesn’t need to be Carroll. Redshirt junior Max Browne and redshirt freshman Sam Darnold don’t have to be as spectacular as former quarterbacks Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart. Sophomore running back Ronald Jones II doesn’t have to be Reggie Bush and so on down the line. This can be a new era of Trojan football, breaking away from the past and charting a new path.
Hopefully, Helton will do it the way he sees fit and yield results similar to that of the Carroll era, where Rose Bowls and national titles are legitimate discussions every season. The process doesn’t have to be the same. It can be more workman-like and less Hollywood. It’s all about the results, and that the next 10 years are way better than the last 10. This summer will be the first indicator of that change taking place.

The Women of Troy sent seven players to compete in both singles and doubles at the individual Pac-12 championships held last week in Ojai, California, where senior Giuliana Olmos and sophomore Gabby Smith saw their runs in the singles and doubles semis end on Saturday.
USC sent three doubles teams. They had the tournament’s No. 4 seed, consisting of senior Giuliana Olmos and sophomore Gabby Smith, and earned one of five at-large bids, with junior Zoë Katz and sophomore Madison Westby taking the spot. Katz and Westby came in at the 80th ranked team in the nation but lost a difficult first round match to a pair from Stanford 7-6 by a score of 7-5 in the tiebreaker. Just as they have all season in dual matches, Olmos and Smith had a strong showing in the tournament, winning their first and second round matches, 7-6 and 6-1, respectively, on the way to a semifinal berth.  In the semis, they fell to the 22nd-ranked team in the nation of Alexandra Osborne and Ebony Panoho from Arizona State, ending their tournament run.
The singles draws brought many more wins for the Women of Troy. Four players were entered in the invitational draw: Smith, senior Paige Keating, and freshmen Jessica Failla and Kristen Venter. Venter and Keating dropped their first round matches in straight sets. Failla continued her strong season with two wins before losing to Melissa Lord from Stanford in the quarterfinals.
Smith made a very impressive run to the semifinals, grinding out three match wins, two of them lasting three sets, before losing to Caroline Lampl from Stanford.
Westby was drawn against the top player in the tournament in the first round, Maegan Manasse from Cal, and lost in straight sets. Katz won her first match over 76th-ranked Lynn Chi from Cal, but lost a competitive 7-5, 7-5 match to Krista Hardebeck from Stanford in the second round. Olmos, seeded fourth in the tournament, finished off some of the last matches of her career strong, winning three matches on her way to the semifinals. But she also ran into Manasse, falling to the Pac-12’s top player.
Although no player came out with a title, the many wins across the board once again showed the depth of this year’s stellar 19th-ranked Trojans. They will wait for the reveal of the national tournament bracket on May 3 and will head to Tulsa, Oklahoma for the team tournament beginning May 19, followed up by individual singles and doubles tournaments to cap off the 2016 campaign.

Elizabeth Gu | Daily Trojan
At a party last week, I tried to introduce myself to someone. When I attempted to tell the person my name, he said, “Oh, I know who you are. You’re a writer, right?”
I smiled and then asked how he knew that. “Oh, I read the Daily Trojan all the time,” he said.
My job at the college newspaper, like most good things in life, started with a tweet. It was the summer before my freshman year, and I had just received an email saying I had been accepted on the Daily Trojan staff.
“Incredibly excited to work for the @dailytrojan on the news staff,” I tweeted. And the Daily Trojan favorited my tweet (#tbt to when that was an option.)
From that moment, my college identity was melded with the DT, and we started our four-year obsessive relationship to one another.
As a journalism student, there’s nothing more iconic than writing for your school newspaper. I couldn’t wait to see my byline in print. There’s definitely an element of narcissism that goes along with it — remember I am still a millennial. But when I was given my first assignment to write about a “substance-free floor” opening at University Gateway, I knew there would be a bit more effort that went into it.
I was so green in my first interview with a student who was dealing with alcoholism. Here I was, this 18-year-old asking someone about how his substance abuse impacted his grades and relationships. I stumbled through that interview, trying to find the balance between sensitivity, but making sure I dove deep enough to retrieve the truth. When the article appeared on the front page of the DT the next day, above the fold, I saved the paper and mailed it home.
Over these four years, I’m not sure how many articles I have written, but I know I have saved them all. I’ve walked away with more bylines then I could imagine, but even more so, developed personal connections with my peers that I might have never met.
That has been my saving grace. During this school year, there has been this ongoing conversation about “safe spaces.” For me, that was the college newsroom. Running from this event to that one, documenting everything from the celebrities who came to campus to the students who were changing the culture of the campus, I felt like I had my pulse on the wide ranges of USC experiences. I could bring all those stories back to the newsroom.
Soon — I don’t know when — people started associating me with the DT. I couldn’t have been happier when this happened.
People say newspapers are “dying” because they struggle to stay relevant and alive. Yet, that idea has never once touched my corner of the world at Daily Trojan. California has one of the strongest freedoms and rights for the reach of college newspapers, and at the DT it never felt like the end was in sight. There’s something special on the fourth floor of the Student Union, a place where I’ve spent more all-nighters than I’ve wanted, where I’ve cried, laughed until I’ve cried once again and learned who I wanted to be. I sent out my first Snapchat in that newsroom. I met my best friends in that newsroom.
But now, as I head into graduation, my greatest fear feels like it is coming true. In my first column, I wrote about not having enough time. Now, I really don’t.
But the great news for those remaining on campus is that you still do have time. You have the time to learn and grow and place yourself in communities that will support you. Today’s college students increasingly need these types of environments as they face mounting financial, mental health and social pressures. If you can find yourself a version of the DT, a place that will help you tell your story in the way you want it told and will challenge you to think outside of yourself, well, then you’ve achieved all that this University asks of you.
And remember, like most good things in life, it starts with a tweet. So make college tweetable. Find a lesson in every moment, and if you’re so inclined — write a column about it. I know I did.
While you are doing that, I know my fellow graduates and I will also be tweeting our way through the transition. We’ll be learning how to remold our identities past this USC bubble. It’ll take time, but we’ll figure it out.
As we move through our lives as busy college students turned even busier adults, remember to leave room to tell stories. Record those stories.
That’s what the college newspaper has helped me to do. It has indelibly defined my college identity. It has reminded me that I still have so much growth and maturity to achieve.
After four years of working at the Daily Trojan, I know that I shouldn’t take my time here for granted. Even this millennial can appreciate that.

The second weekend of the Coachella Valley Arts Music and Arts Festival was a ticket to a sweaty and hazy desert paradise. Over the years, Coachella has become more than just a music festival — it has become an experience in itself, defined by factors completely unrelated to music. Originally an obscure event meant for indie music lovers to lay on the grass and enjoy music, the festival has completely evolved over the years, with more diverse genres of music including EDM, hip-hop and rock in addition to becoming a mainstream destination for not only the music, but also fashion and food. With so many shenanigans that occurred during the first weekend, including surprise appearances by Sam Smith and Kanye West, the second weekend was filled with even more anticipation and promise.
On Friday evening, under the palm trees and the pink sky, hip-hop artist A$AP Rocky took the stage to excited fans, hoping that he would bringing out Kanye West. He sang popular hits “Goldie,” “L$D,” and brought out his friend Tyler the Creator to share the stage with him. He brought out A$AP Ferg of A$AP mob to perform their acclaimed single “Hella Hoes,” dedicating their performance to group member A$AP Yams, who recently passed away from accidental overdose. “Rest in f-in peace Yams” Rocky shouted as everyone put their arms up in solidarity. He ended his set with his most well-known song, “F-ckin Problems.” During weekend one, Kanye West crashed A$AP Rocky’s performance, and the crowd thought the same would happen as a surprise. However, things turned out differently. “Kanye, Kanye” the crowd shouted as R&B star Miguel came out on stage. Many were disappointed but still welcomed his presence as the two artists sang “Everyday” together. Other popular artists like James Bay, CHVRCHES, Disclosure and Jack Ü  enchanted audiences and fans with their powerful stage presence and performances. However, the most phenomenal performance took place on Saturday night, during Ice Cube’s set. They dedicated a very short performance to NWA member Eazy-E by bring out his son Lil’ E and singing a short clip of “Boyz-in-the-Hood.” He also brought out NWA members DJ Yella and MC Ren to play “Straight Outta Compton.”
“We missin’ somebody if you know what I mean,” Ice Cube said after the performance to the crowd.  “Is there a doctor in the mother f-icking house?”
The audience went insane as he brought out rapper Dr. Dre who sang a mind-blowing cover of Tupac’s “California Love.”
During Ice Cube’s performance, he projected images of Eazy-E as well as clips from Straight Outta Compton, the powerful film that told the story of NWA and hit themes on racial and social injustice, as well as clips of protests for the justice of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager that was shot and killed by a neighborhood watchman in 2012. NWA’s notorious 1988 song, “F-ck Tha Police” sparked much controversy and heightened the tension between the police and African Americans. The whole crowd put their middle fingers up and shouted the words to the song, emphasizing the importance of freedom of speech in our country.
Freedom is what the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival stands for whether it’s wearing the ridiculous outfit that one would never wear to school or work, or standing on a random person’s shoulders or rolling on the grass for no reason other than the fact that it’s fun, the second weekend was a blissful experience.

Misogyny is no stranger to television. Likewise, it has been explored in Mad Men, The Sopranos and other shows of the past decade focused on the post-war depiction of the male psyche — one that was fragile and fragmented — rather than cop shows, medical shows and other ensemble stories. Don’t get me wrong, cop and medical dramas still exist and are vastly successful;  but take for instance, the change of pace from a show like Gilligan’s Island — which was a comedy about a group of strangers on an island — and ABC’s Lost, which was also an ensemble show about strangers working together on an island, but rooted itself firmly in its protagonist Jack’s inner turmoil and personal life pre-crash. This is just an example of how the TV landscape changed to focus inwardly — and mostly focus inwardly on the male.
A result of this male-gazing (excuse the pun) was a dramatic fixation on misogyny. Period dramas like Mad Men depicted Don Draper’s  (Jon Hamm) sexual exploits and womanizing, and although it wasn’t necessarily kosher, the misogyny wasn’t entirely looked down upon either — it was a fact of the time. The era of Man in the Grey Flannel Suit meant that bosses slept with their secretaries without either party batting an eyelash. We also saw it in Billy Wilder’s The Apartment and in the more contemporary Revolutionary Road, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, directed by Sam Mendes. The men were allowed not only to prevent women from rising the ranks of the corporate ladder, but also given free reign to take advantage of them, using the female brain and body for person gain.
Mad Men was much of the same. Draper and his other comrades at Sterling Cooper were disrespectful of their wives and secretaries and although we follow a few plotlines concerning the women over the years, it is a predominantly male show. When it is about women, there’s still an element of the women being lesser than the men. Betty Draper (January Jones) feels petty and unlikable in her suburban housewife turmoil, her drama often one note and unchanging. Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks) uses her curves to get her way more often than not and Peggy Olson, (Elizabeth Moss) though independent and strong-willed, is often beset by the male characters, hooked as she is on one of the other ad guys in the office (eventually leading to an emotionally scarring abortion) and dependent on Hamm’s stamp of approval. While yes, Mad Men is one of the more subversive of the male-oriented shows, it is also part of the same generation, fixated as it is on the male ego — the men feel above the women, and that just seems to be how it goes in television.
So when the trailers for HBO’s 1970s-themed Vinyl arrived, I expected much of the same and upon watching the pilot, and I wasn’t disappointed. The protagonist Richie Finestra (Bobby Cannavale) is a troubled Manhattan music executive trying to save his dying record label, often looking toward drugs and mistreating his lovely housewife Devon (Olivia Wilde), rather than actually solving his problems. I felt, as I watched the two-hour massacre of good drama (because, truly, the pilot is very bad) that I pretty much knew how the rest of this show would go. Richie would continue to fraternize and philander his way through the show, and we’d find him likable despite all this, because we are taught — in this glorification of sex and male domination — that this type of drama is what we should expect and accept.
But the thing is, Richie is not particularly likeable. Maybe this was by intent of the first season writer’s room or maybe just a result of misguided writing. But authorial intent aside, the product of the writing presented audiences with a depiction of the male character not often seen on television. Sure, Don Draper is morally faulty, but you generally like him. Furthermore, Draper’s co-worker Roger Sterling (John Slattery) exploits are basically forgiven because Sterling is so charming throughout the show. But Richie (and other character’s like Ray Romano’s Zak Yankovich) is completely unlikable. We don’t feel bad for him, we’re given no reason to. And that’s where Richie doesn’t get away — at least audience-wise — with his exploitation. We aren’t viewing him through the lens of glorification or sympathy. Nothing about his actions is admirable or forgiving. It’s an interesting presentation of the male, if nothing else.
Furthermore, the men are depicted as more fragile than their female counterparts, and perhaps more visually exploited than the women as well. Because even though Devon feels stuck in a similar suburban-housewife conundrum as Betty Draper, Richie and Zak are struck by their crisis in an even more desperate way. When Zak comes home with a broken nose (courtesy of Richie) he’s too ashamed to tell his wife, instead blaming it on a car accident. Later, Zak contemplates suicide, even turning on his car in the garage and pulling out sleeping pills, but is ultimately too cowardly to go through with it. I don’t even have time to talk about the Jamie Vine (Juno Temple) who — despite her rank as sandwich girl in the office — trumps Clark Morelle (Jack Quaid), who eventually is demoted as Jamie is promoted in the office.
The male body is on full display in a way I haven’t seen on any show as of late. A lead singer in an up-and-coming band sits nude on a chair, shooting heroin into his skin but looking more like a naked, vulnerable child than a guy just needing a fix. Zak wakes completely naked after engaging in a “god-sent” extra-marital threesome, only to find his hotel safe empty, believing the two women whom he so poorly claimed as his own had robbed him. We also glimpse Fenestre’s naked frame as he walks out of a shower, where he embraces his wife desperately and then walks off frame. There is a surprising element of equality in this show — despite the misogyny — that feels original and wholly unique to Vinyl’s voice.  So with the season finale having aired last week, and the next few days of studying before finals, maybe take some time and binge Vinyl. I don’t promise that you will love it, but I do promise interesting gender subversion. At the very least, it’s worth it for the outfits.

cheers.
Thanks Tim, that is good trick. But my criticism still stands. Text needs to be a certain darkness to be readable. It is a huge mistake that many “fancy” websites make that I think makes about as much sense as “blinking text” made back in the day. Thankfully, others concurred and that no longer is a thing.
