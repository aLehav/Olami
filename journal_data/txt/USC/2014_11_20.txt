This week on campus, Undergraduate Student Government, the RISE Alliance and the Trojans Respect Consent campaign joined forces to orchestrate USC’s first National Week of Action, a week of events aimed at fighting sexual assault and expressing support for survivors on campus.

A part of the White House-led #ItsOnUs initiative, the National Week of Action is hosted on campuses through the nation. USC’s programs hope to promote the campaign “Trojans Respect Consent,” and help students define consent on a personal scale, as well promote the idea of bystander intervention during cases of assault.
In timely fashion, Rolling Stone magazine’s expose on mishandling of sexual assault cases at the University of Virginia was published early Wednesday, and shared more than 38,000 times before the end of the day. Thousands of stunned readers took to social media to voice their dissatisfaction with university handling of the case described in the article, of a freshman student who was gang raped by members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity chapter at UVA.
USC is no stranger to flak regarding mishandling of sexual assault cases, and every story written and reported about the 2013 Title IX investigation seems to offer yet another survivor’s story of rape as a student at USC.
Groups such as RISE and the Women’s Student Assembly are working hard to change that, and most importantly, change the mindset of USC’s students and how they regard sexual assaults.
“I’d love to see the culture on campus change, and it all depends on the students,” said sophomore Shyann Murphy, executive director of the Women’s Student Assembly. “I hope campaigns like this make people question things that they haven’t questioned before.”
Programming throughout the week was dedicated to jump-starting conversations about consent, sexual assault reporting and survivor support. Speakers have included representatives from the Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center and a healthy relationships expert.
Friday will feature an open house at the Center for Women & Men’s new location in the Engemann Student Health Center, Suite 356. Students can enjoy free food and giveaways, and get to know the current staff from noon to 2 p.m.
Both Murphy and USG Vice President Rini Sampath, however, agree that programs like these often present to students that are actively involved in sexual assault prevention on campus, and overlooked by increasingly busy students.
This issue is also reflected on a national scale: the White House @ItsOnUs Twitter account has just over 700 followers, a tiny fraction of the thousands of students at universities at which it is being implemented. A search of the University of Virginia online media hub ULoop: UVA Classifieds and News yields a single article on the campaign.
Student leaders at USC believe, however, that any steps in the right direction should be reflected as such. Over the summer, the Greek community assembled a Greek task force to address the pressing issue of sexual assaults especially on The Row and have since implemented a certification process for all chapters of the Panhellenic Council and the Interfraternity Council. As a part of this certification, chapters must attend training and show 80 percent attendance in order to avoid sanctions on their next class of new members, according to senior President of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity Joey Backs.
“I think at the very least, it’s better than nothing, and at most it’s one of the most proactive efforts the school has seen in a while,” he said. “If anything, it got a lot of chapters talking about it, which hasn’t happened a lot before.”
Sampath and Murphy both agree that student-led action has been a driving force of change in regards to sexual assault cases at USC over the past few years. Sampath says the formation of the task force shows student commitment to change.
“I’m proud of Greek leaders for acknowledging that it does happen on The Row, that they can have a culture that perpetuates harassment towards women,” she said. “For them to come forward and say we need to re-evaluate the way we see each other and self-impose this training, it’s phenomenal.”
The idea of a culture shift is one that comes up time and time again in conversations about sexual assault on university campuses, where more often than not, students are wholly aware of the incidents of violence taking place around them. In the case of UVA student detailed in the Rolling Stone article, her peers encouraged her to keep quiet, in order to preserve her social standing. The power of peers in many cases is reflected in the initiative of “Trojans Respect Consent” to encourage bystander intervention.
Sampath believes this is one of the ways in which programming can have legitimate and perceptible effect on campus.
“I would say that if there’s anything that we can learn from these stories, it’s that we have a shared responsibility for protecting our students,” Sampath said.
Murphy agreed and included the USC administration in the shared “we” who have a responsibility to student safety.
“It’s a very extremely real problem at USC that a lot more light needs to be shed on it,” Murphy said. “Let’s really look at the way we act, the way we treat each other and the culture on campus.”

On Thursday night, the USC Center on Public Diplomacy hosted “Out Abroad: LGBT, Public Diplomacy and Global Rights,” a reception and discussion on the complex and evolving discourse of homosexuality in diplomatic relations.
The event, which was held in Wallis Annenberg Hall from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., was co-sponsored by the USC LGBT Resource Center. It consisted of speeches from three guest speakers that preceded a panel moderated by the center’s director, Rev. Kelby Harrison.

Patrick J. Linehan, CPD Public Diplomat in Residence and Former Consul General at the U.S. Consulate General in Osaka-Kobe, Japan, spoke of his early experiences working for the state department as a gay man.
“When I joined the state department in 1984, the commissioner there said, ‘There’s no room for homos in the department. If you’re queer, you’re out,’” Linehan said. “There were no gays and by that I mean no one talked about it because you would lose your job.”
Linehan affirms the United States has made remarkable progress in recent years; when he met his husband, Emerson, in 2002, no state permitted gay marriage. The nation, however, remains somewhere in the middle on the spectrum of countries in support and resistance of LGBT rights.
“We recognize on the one hand there are countries way ahead of us, like Sweden and the Netherlands,” Linehan said. “On the other extreme in places like Uganda and Russia, we have people who could be put to death or imprisoned simply for being gay. Nationally, and with the world as a whole, we still have a long, long way to go.”
Douglas Janoff, Senior, Canadian diplomat and diplomat in residence at the University of Kentucky, presented his findings on homophobic violence across the world and how organizations like the United Nations and the Council of Europe are responding.
“My research focuses on how LGBT discourse has arisen in these human rights forums and what that tells us about attitudes around the world,” Janoff said.
Janoff cited various countries’ support or rejection of resolution 17/19 “Human rights, sexual orientation, and gender identity” of the Human Rights Council and how they reflected regional trends. While almost all European states supported the resolution, hardly any African nations or predominantly Muslim states were in favor of it.
Janoff described how individuals around the world find it difficult to reach out to others and advocate for their rights, particularly in countries where human rights are so severely suppressed.
“It can be a lonely life, very isolating, when everyone around you is in a social pattern not accustomed to homosexuality,” Janoff said. “You have to be strong within yourself.”
Monica Trasandes, director of Spanish-Language and Latino Media for GLAAD, addressed the issue of LGBT rights in Latin America as it is portrayed in the media.
“There’s been a real problem acknowledging LGBT rights in Latin America since many parts are very evangelical and religious,” Trasandes said.
In the final panel, all three speakers made remarks about LGBT rights in the international community moving forward.
Trasandes hopes to instill the idea of coexistence between faith and support for LGBT rights in Latin America.
“Whenever I speak to people who insist to me their faith really tells them homosexuality is a sin, I just tell them that I know lots of people who are devoutly Catholic who do not see faith and supporting homosexuality as an either-or situation,” Trasandes said.
From the perspective of the role of the United States, Linehan emphasizes equality as a whole in any diplomatic activity.
“As a diplomat, it is my job to advocate on U.S. policy,” Linehan said. “Our government advocates for human rights and that everyone should be treated equally.”

This weekend, USC’s Residential Student Government received regional honors at the Pacific Affiliate of the National Association of College and University Residence Halls (PACURH) Fall Conference hosted at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. To earn these regional awards, USC’s delegation competed with programs from nearly 70 other West Coast colleges and universities, some from as far away as Alaska and Canada. This year’s conference theme was Life in the Fishbowl: Waves of Change, Oceans of Opportunity.
USC’s delegation was led by RSG President Sera Choi, National Communications Coordinator Tina Tzeng and USC’s National Residence Hall Honorary President Michael Tong. Choi, Tzeng and Tong coordinated the delegation’s preparation of recognition bids and guided freshman RSG representatives who participated in the conference for the first time.
RSG’s annual Spirits at Troy event was selected from the 70 schools participating as the Regional PACURH Program of the Year. The program will now be sent to the National Association of College and University Residence Halls for review.
For the past 20 years, Spirits at Troy has been a signature event for the USC community. RSG’s annual Spirits at Troy has provided community members and their children with a safe environment to celebrate Halloween trick-or-treating. RSG invites student organizations to contribute recreational and educational activities for the children to enjoy while they are on campus.
This October, more than 450 community members and their families participated in the campus event. Forty USC student organizations contributed to the planning and execution of this year’s Spirits at Troy, and nearly half of them were residential organizations, overseen by Residential Student Government.
At the PACURH conference, university delegations participated in spirit competitions, philanthropy activities and other programming related to social justice, sustainability, health and leadership.
USC’s delegation also won regional awards for the First Place Digital Banner and the Second Place Roll Call Video.
Tzeng was in charge of preparing the delegation of freshmen for the PACURH conference. Tzeng was awarded with the “Golden Frog Pin Award,” given by the PACURH region directors for her outstanding contributions to the program.
“Throughout my college career, I’ve always heard about the bond of Trojan Family, but nothing truly fit my definition of a family until I joined RSG,” Tzeng said. “Our delegation has become a small, tight-knit family within the larger university community … We highlight each other’s strengths and build upon one another’s weaknesses.”

Students, faculty and alumni gathered in McCarthy Quad on Thursday night to attend Conquest, the university’s 11th annual rally and concert. The event was hosted by Program Board, Concerts Committee, the Office of Campus Activities and Trojan Pride.

Conquest was created as a means of highlighting Trojan pride before the school’s rivalry game against UCLA. The event is aimed at gathering a variety of campus organizations to hold an all-encompassing event for the USC community.
Kirsten Lee, assistant director of Concerts Committee, said that though the process of preparing for the event was smooth, keeping the headliners a secret created some difficulties.
“I think our only difficulty was that we were not able to release the headliners as soon as we wanted to, and that is a big thing for us because there is nothing we can do. We try to expedite the process as much as possible but it is really a contractual thing between the legal teams with the artist and the university. We are kind of that middle man, we don’t have that power,” Lee said. “I think that is something that we are really trying to educate students on, because I think that they think it’s all us.”
Vendors included Nesquik, Kogi tacos, the Lime Truck, Waffles de Liege, Coolhaus, the Grilled Cheese Truck and the Boba Truck.
Monica Parra, former executive director of Program Board, hosted the event. Parra kicked off the rally by introducing various student organizations such as the Order of the Torch, which included brief introductions by members such as USG President Andrew Menard and USC Panhellenic President Katherine Grabar.
Following their introductions were the announcements for Mr. and Ms. USC Order of the Torch 2014-2015. Winners of the title were Chris Reimann and Ama Konadu Amoafo-Yeboah.
Parra also introduced Trojan Dance Force, Troy Tones, Concert Force and 13 different athletic teams on campus.
Midway through the student-athlete introductions, the generator for the stage lost power, but students quickly turned their attention to the Trojan Marching Band and Song Girls, who performed for more than an hour.
The rally ended with a guest appearance by the USC football team and a “burn-the-Bruin-bear” bonfire and fireworks spectacular by Doheny Memorial Library, sponsored by Trojan Pride.
Students rushed back to the stage to watch performances by headliners Phantogram and Big Boi.
Phantogram, an electronic, rock duo performed over an hour-long set, with crowd favorites such as “Blackout Days,” from their recent album Voices, and “Mouthful of Diamonds.”
The concert then took a shift in musical style with a performance by Big Boi, otherwise known as Antwan Andre Patton.
Big Boi, a member of recently reunited hip-hop duo, Outkast, stunned the crowd with his interactive music performance with Phantogram. Together, they performed a single from their recent EP “CPU.”
Ryan Hamilton, executive director of Concerts Committee, explained how Big Boi and Phantogram represent the unique variety of music taste among students.
“I think that these artists are ones that students really want to see and they attract a very diverse audience, because one is indie -alternative, kind of electronic and the other one [performer] is a hip-hop legend…It’s going to be a really special show, something that hasn’t ever been done for Conquest before. Both artists have never played a co-headlining show together,” Hamilton said.
Miranda Ferro, a junior majoring in psychology, was thrilled to see how the event brought a mixture of Trojan pride, entertainment and a variety of food options to campus.
“I really liked coming out to Conquest because it shows we have a lot of school spirit. I really liked going to all of the food trucks and experiencing the Ferris wheel,” Ferro said.
Sounds like a good match, ghetto music at the University of South Central.

This time last year, true freshman wide receiver JuJu Smith was finishing his senior year of high school and preparing for his high school playoff game that fell on his 17th birthday. Fast-forward a year, and Smith has already made a place for himself in USC’s record books, now holding the record for most receiving yards in a USC debut with 123. So far this season, he’s racked up a total of 531 yards on 42 receptions and has five touchdowns. All this and Smith is not yet a legal adult.

Smith, who will celebrate his 18th birthday Saturday as the Trojans take on their crosstown rival UCLA Bruins, said he’s proud of the contributions he’s made at such a young age.
“It feels good just knowing that I’m still 17, and I’m out here doing everything I can for this team,” Smith said.
Smith attributes his success in football to his drive to be the best receiver possible.
“I think it’s really my work ethic,” Smith said. “I’m not the fastest and I’m not the biggest, but I always put in the extra work, and I feel like that’s what separates me from other players.”
Despite his success so far, Smith is USC’s second receiver, behind junior Nelson Agholor — still an impressive feat for just a 17-year-old.
“For me especially, I look up to Nelson Agholor,” Smith said. “He’s a great guy. Everyday I try to outwork him and compete with him. He mentors me a lot. That’s what I like about him. He’s not selfish. He knows I can make plays and he believes in me, and we really have trust in each other.”
Though Agholor came to USC from Tampa, Florida, Smith graduated from local powerhouse Long Beach Poly in 2014 and immediately enrolled in summer school at USC. Smith said adjusting to summer school was hard initially, but he feels he had an easy transition to life at USC.
“It’s been easy,” Smith said. “I feel like my high school has taught me a lot and matured me a lot to get me to where I am today.”
The transition from high school football to college football was made easy for Smith by head coach Steve Sarkisian.
“It’s been very smooth with him,” Smith said. “I met Coach Sark when I went to Washington. He’s a great coach. He’s a player coach, he really understands the players. I feel comfortable with him, and I know I can talk to him and ask him for anything.”
Smith’s high school performance impressed not only USC, but 25 other schools.
“I was recruited by 26 schools,” Smith said. “The ones I liked were USC, Oregon, Alabama, Notre Dame and UCLA. They’re all great schools, but I’m a Christian man and staying home allows me to go to my church at home.”
Smith originally planned to attend Oregon but changed his mind the night before signing day.
“The day before, I told my mom I wanted to go to Oregon,” Smith said. “It was really hard. I really thought about it that night, and I woke up the next morning and I decided I wanted to go to USC.”
Smith has already made a name for himself on the football field but is still trying to find his academic path. His major is currently undecided, but he is leaning toward a degree in human biology.
“I’m very interested in it because I like working with the body,” Smith said. “I could do sports medicine or even become a chiropractor.”
As he continues to grow up, Smith plans to make some changes. When he turns 18, he wants to legally change his last name to Schuster to honor his stepdad.
“It means a lot to me,” Smith said. “My stepdad came into my life when I was four years old, and he introduced me to football. He’s a very big part of my life, so I want to change my name to Schuster. I want to do it by the beginning of next year.”
Smith tries to honor his family every time he steps out onto the field and hopes that will translate into a win on Saturday. Aside from a USC victory on his birthday, Smith is also hoping for an unorthodox gift: a unicycle.
“Besides winning this game, I want an AirWheel. It’s an electric unicycle,” Smith said. “But for right now, my only plan is to just win the game, and then I’ll see what happens afterward.”
HBD Mr. Schuster, Someone get this man a unicycle!

I cringe every time I think about it, and at times it’s hard to believe, but over the past few months I’ve finally come to accept the following: I am a senior in college.
As frightening as it might feel to be graduating in just seven months, there’s one thing that makes me feel extremely fortunate to be part of the class of 2015 — I was lucky enough to witness the 50-0 game in person.
It was my freshman year, and the first year that the NCAA imposed sanctions on USC. The sanctions ignited a certain passion in Trojan fans, so we celebrated each win with extra vigor — especially the wins at Notre Dame and Oregon. Heading into the season finale against the Bruins, the Trojans sported a 9-2 record, and golden boy Matt Barkley had put together a record-setting season.
The UCLA game was nothing short of perfect. Barkley threw for six touchdowns in what many assumed would be the last game he ever played at USC, in front of the crowd of 93,000. The moon shone over the beautiful 50-0 scoreboard and the Olympic Torch burned bright next to it. Students felt pure elation.
But as great as the 50-0 win felt, next year’s trip to the Rose Bowl felt equally as awful. As rain fell and the clock ticked down, UCLA linebacker Anthony Barr sacked Barkley, and the Trojan nation held its breath — and held back tears — as Barkley stayed down.
Last year’s loss to UCLA incited no feeling at all in me, just numbness, as the Bruins beat the Trojans 35-14 at the Coliseum to secure their first consecutive wins against USC since 1997-1998. UCLA fans roared that they finally owned L.A., and it appeared the rivalry was no longer one-sided.
So who really has the upper hand in L.A.? The team that absolutely demolished the other three years ago? Or the team that’s won the last two meetings? It’s a back-and-forth that all rivalries go through. Fans of one team will point to the overall series record. Fans of the other might point to one significant game. Heading into the Crosstown Cup, I’ll take the time to present both sides of the argument.
Yes, UCLA has won the last two meetings, but USC has won seven of the last 10, if you include the two wins vacated by the NCAA. From 1991-1998, UCLA won eight consecutive meetings, the longest streak in the series. USC responded by rattling off seven straight wins from 1999-2005. Dating back to 1929 — a game which USC won 76-0 — the Trojans lead the all-time series 46-30-7 (or 44-30-7 if you don’t want to count the vacated wins in 2004 and 2005).
Aside from that, there are the Heisman and national championship conversations. USC had produced seven Heisman trophy winners: Mike Garrett, O.J. Simpson, Charles White, Marcus Allen, Carson Palmer, Matt Leinart and Reggie Bush. UCLA fans are quick to point out, though, that one of those Heismans was taken away and one belongs to a man who was charged with murder.
But how many Heisman winners can UCLA claim? One.
Let’s look at national championships, too. USC has won 11 national championships in football.
How many national championships can UCLA claim? One.
That just about ends the conversation for me.
USC and UCLA share a special rivalry — no other teams in the same city have such perennially relevant athletic programs. The prestigious academics of each institution lend themselves to the rivalry being a respectful one as well, which many rivalries across the country cannot claim (though I was happy to see that Florida students express their support for Florida State students following the tragic shooting on their campus Wednesday night).
Here in L.A., there’s no question that historically USC is the superior football program. My question is whether fans and students can continue to fall back on history.
If USC doesn’t win on Saturday, it’s time for the 50-0 bragging to stop. We need to live in the moment. Trust me, reveling in the joy of beating UCLA is a much better feeling than citing the Trojans’ all-time record against the Bruins.
Hopefully the seniors on the team have the same desire to finish their careers 2-2 against UCLA rather than 1-3.
Let’s legitimize that graffiti that somehow ended up on UCLA’s Bruin Statue last week: ’SC runs L.A.
Aubrey Kragen is a senior majoring in communication. She is also the sports editor of the Daily Trojan. Her column, “Release the Kragen,” runs Fridays.
Well, so much for being relevant.  SC got spanked.  Not much of a rivalry after a 3peat loss.
BTW, USC ceased being relevant long ago.
Beat the gutties. Go SC!

More than bragging rights will be on the line this Saturday afternoon when the USC football team heads to the Rose Bowl to face archrival UCLA. Both the No. 24 Trojans (7-3, 6-2 Pac-12) and the No. 11 Bruins (8-2, 5-2) still have a shot to win the Pac-12 South, but a loss spells trouble for either team’s hopes of reaching the conference championship game. USC head coach Steve Sarkisian is aware of the emotions that surround such a heated rivalry but believes his team is focused on the task at hand.
Top notch · Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler is second in the Pac-12 in passing efficiency, while UCLA’s gunslinger, Brett Hundley, is third. Kessler has thrown 29 touchdowns and just three interceptions this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
“We’re focusing on what we can control,” Sarkisian said. “Emotions are tricky, especially in rivalry games. Sometimes you like that emotion in the air, but sometimes it can get the better of you. There’s a fine line and a balance in there.”
For redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler, the game has a special meaning.
“You’re remembered for the games you play [against] UCLA and Notre Dame,” Kessler told Trojans Live. “Unfortunately, last year we lost to both of them. So definitely this year I got a little chip on my shoulder.”
Fittingly, the matchup will serve as a duel between two of the Pac-12’s best signal callers: Kessler and UCLA’s Brett Hundley. Hundley leads the conference in completion percentage (72.1) and ranks third in passing efficiency (158.0), while Kessler comes in at second in both categories. Containing Hundley — who has also rushed for 564 yards and seven touchdowns — is the key to putting the brakes on the Bruins’ offensive attack.
“[UCLA]’s got an explosive passing game,” Sarkisian said. “They’ve got a plethora of receivers that they can roll through. They use a lot of tempo.”
Junior defensive end Leonard Williams is focusing on Hundley’s running ability.
“Last year and the year before we were kind of controlling the game in the first half and then [Hundley] started getting some scrambling yards,” Williams said. “That’s when they started coming back and winning the game.”
Results aside, UCLA has clearly been an improved football team in the second half of the season. The Bruins started the year with ugly non-conference wins over Virginia, Memphis and Texas, eventually falling to Utah and Oregon in consecutive weeks. Pass protection proved to be the team’s biggest problem, as opponents sacked Hundley and backup quarterback Jerry Neuheisel 23 times through five games. UCLA’s offensive line has buckled down of late, however, allowing only eight sacks since the Utah loss. Sarkisian and the Trojans’ defensive front will aim to reverse this trend on Saturday.
“We’re going to have to be effective at [the pass rush],” Sarkisian said. “Brett Hundley’s just too good. We can’t let him stand back there and survey the field, and then when it’s not there, tuck the ball and run.”
Helping USC in its goal to keep Hundley on his toes will be senior linebacker J.R. Tavai, who returns from injury this week. Williams feels that Tavai will play a key role against the Bruins.
“I’m glad to have J.R. [Tavai] back,” Williams said. “He’s a great pass rusher, and he’s also physical in the run game. He’s definitely going to help us out.”
Saturday’s contest could also play a large part in determining the Pac-12’s top rusher. Though redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen currently leads the conference with 1184 yards, UCLA running back Paul Perkins is right on his tail. Perkins has racked up 1172 yards on only 190 carries, compared to Allen’s 217. Sarkisian feels that the running game is an underrated facet of the Bruins’ success.
“They’ve committed themselves much more to running the football with designed runs for the runner,” Sarkisian said. “That’s gone on for about the five or six weeks. [Perkins] just presents more problems. The more offense you have, the more versatility you have, the tougher you are to defend.”
Last week’s 38-30 win over Cal was the latest in a series of games where the Trojans struggled to finish off their opponents — the team has been outscored 78-66 in the fourth quarter this season. Sophomore linebacker Su’a Cravens acknowledged this issue at practice this week.
“That’s kind of been the problem we’ve had a lot this year is just to execute and be disciplined in the fourth [quarter],” Cravens said. “As long as we’re disciplined throughout the game and everybody’s doing their job, we won’t have to worry.”
Though USC leads the all-time series 46-30, Hundley and the Bruins have won two straight against their crosstown foes. A win for UCLA this time around would leave them just one game away from a Pac-12 South title, while the Trojans still need an Arizona State loss to advance. This weekend’s battle kicks off at 5 p.m. PST and will be broadcast on ABC.
Quick Hits
The Bruins are a four-point favorite to win their third straight against USC.
As is tradition, both teams will wear home colors at the Rose Bowl. USC will again wear metallic red helmets.
Sarkisian mentioned that senior cornerback Josh Shaw could play against the Bruins.
“I’m getting closer to narrowing down his role,” the first-year coach said. “But a lot of his role just depends on how he looks on gameday.”
Freshman safety John Plattenburg is fully ready to play.
Still no update on freshman tight end Bryce Dixon, who missed the Cal game because of a student conduct issue. Dixon returned to practice this week, but his status against UCLA is unknown.

USC’s biggest test of the season so far is finally here, as the No. 19 Trojans head across town to take on the No. 9 UCLA Bruins. UCLA has won the battle of L.A. the last two years, and the Trojans are hungry to take back the Victory Bell. The matchup features two of the Pac-12’s most accurate passers, in USC’s Cody Kessler and UCLA’s Brett Hundley. With a loss, USC would be knocked out of Pac-12 South championship contention. Daily Trojan sports editor Aubrey Kragen sat down with the Daily Bruin football beat writer, Kevin Bowman, to give fans a better picture of what to expect this Saturday.
 
Daily Trojan: This matchup features the top two running backs in the conference in USC’s Javorius “Buck” Allen and UCLA’s Paul Perkins. What style of a runner is Perkins?
Kevin Bowman: Perkins has really evolved this season under the tutelage of former USC running backs coach Kennedy Polamalu. Nothing about Perkins’ physical skills is all that eye-popping. He lacks break away speed, isn’t overly powerful and doesn’t have the slickest of juke moves. But what Perkins does have is intelligence. He has incredible vision and patience, and his ability do just run downfield and not try to dance around too much in the backfield like many young running backs is key to his success.
 
DT: UCLA QB Brett Hundley entered the season as a potential Heisman candidate and is one of the most efficient passers in the nation, so why has Hundley dropped out of the Heisman conversation as the year has gone on?
KB: Brett Hundley never really was a legitimate Heisman contender, and his fall from that conversation is largely due to the public finally realizing that. On paper, Hundley’s had a great season. He’s completed over 70 percent of his passes, thrown just four interceptions and been dangerous on the ground as well. But the reasoning for those impressive stats is also the reason he’s not a Heisman candidate.
Hundley has proven this year that he still lacks quality vision from the pocket. He often stares down one receiver too long, struggles to cycle through his reads and rarely throws a pass unless his target is wide open; he hasn’t shown enough faith in his receivers, or maybe in his own arm, to let them make difficult plays. So the result is Hundley throwing a whole lot of screen and swing passes – artificially boosting his completion percentage – and giving up on pass plays to just run. He’s been effective with his legs recently, but has a tendency to rely on them too heavily at the expense of the passing game.
 
DT: The Bruins’ offensive line struggled early in the season, but has drastically improved over the last couple games. How will they fare against USC’s vaunted front seven?
KB: This year’s O-line may be the best group UCLA has had in several years. The Bruins have probably at least eight lineman capable of starting and have been very effective in the five games since allowing 10 sacks to Utah. USC’s defensive line, however, will be the best group UCLA has faced since Utah. Coach Jim Mora and several players commented on the enormous talent of Leonard Williams and he’ll obviously be a challenge to contain. Still, the offensive line has developed into a strong group and likely won’t be dominated by the Trojans. It should definitely be an interesting battle to watch, though.
 
DT: UCLA recently climbed to No. 9 in the College Football Playoff poll and No. 11 in the AP rankings? Are the Bruins deserving of such high rankings? 
KB: UCLA came into the season ranked No. 7 in the AP poll. Back then, that was a gross over-ranking of the Bruins. Now, however, this UCLA team feels pretty deserving of its accolades. The Bruins have been dominant in their past two games, nearly shutting out a potent Arizona offense then running away from Washington in a challenging road environment. UCLA is also on pace to finish with one of the strongest strength of schedules in the nation, with early season “gimme” games against Texas and Memphis looking like good wins now that the Longhorns and the Tigers are both bowl eligible. UCLA is playing its best football of the year, is on a roll, and is deserving of its rankings.
 
DT: Who will be UCLA’s impact player of the game?
KB: As much as there is to critique Brett Hundley for, he’ll still be the biggest key to UCLA’s success. If he’s able to stay in the pocket and read the defense well – as he did last game – he could pick apart USC’s secondary through the air like he did Washington’s. However, even if he chooses to scramble more regularly, Hundley’s effectiveness on the ground has been critical in several of the Bruins’ wins this year. Whichever style Hundley ends up going with Saturday, UCLA needs him to excel at it.
 
DT: Final score?
KB: I have UCLA winning 38-24. USC clearly has some incredibly dangerous skill players on offense, but UCLA’s defense has stepped its performance up over the past two games. Combine that with USC’s tendency to struggle at the end of games and I think UCLA will be able to pull away. The one potential factor that could work against the Bruins is the return of national media attention and hype. They admitted to struggling with the College Football Playoff expectations at the beginning of the year and now that the possibility of reaching the playoffs has returned, if the Bruins get too emotional or tense for this game, things could get away from them.

The USC women’s basketball team will look to build on a productive trip to the Carolinas as they return to California to play Long Beach State today at 4:30 p.m. in Long Beach, then come to the Galen Center to play their home opener against Fresno State on Sunday, Nov. 23 at 2 p.m.
USC (1-1) started their season off against a very strong opponent in No. 2 South Carolina (2-0) last Saturday, in a game where the lead kept shifting back and forth and neither team was able to pull away. USC was able to seize a 53-52 lead late in the second half, but a 14-0 surge by the Gamecocks killed USC’s chances for an upset.
The Women of Troy would bounce back quickly, however, and beat Davidson (1-2)99-64. All USC starters finished with double-digit points, while every player on the roster scored at least one basket.
“It’s huge for our confidence,” said head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke after the Davidson game. “We’re on a long road trip, so it’s huge for us to get back on the court and get a big win against Davidson.”
The second-year head coach emphasized her team’s resilience as well.
“We were determined, and played great defense. A lot of people got a lot of minutes, and we were able to play well against a very good Davidson team.”
USC’s tough schedule to start the year continues with their match against Long Beach State (2-0), who is coming off of an 85-73 win over Seattle University, and a 74-62 win against San Diego State. They’re followed up by Fresno State (2-0), who is also off to a hot start after a 67-56 win over Cal Poly and a 65-36 demolishing of Cal State Stanislaus.
“I think it’s pretty good,” said freshman guard McKenzie Calvert about the team’s morale. “Right now we’re just hungry. We’re ready to play all the top teams. We’re ready to just prove and get some respect from everybody.”
The 49ers’ starting five is highlighted by Madison Montgomery, who leads all starters with 10.5 points and 4.0 rebounds per game. Their bench is just as loaded, however, as Alex Sanchez leads the team in scoring with 12.0 points per game, and is second in assists with 4.5 per game. Lauren Spargo is also averaging 10.0 points per game off the bench.
The Women of Troy beat Long Beach State 89-72 at the Galen Center last season, behind a double-double from Cassie Harberts (24 points, 14 rebounds) and 17 points from Ariya Crook. Harberts and Crook were two of five players to score double-digit points for USC.
USC is 22-29 all-time against the 49ers, with the 49ers’ last win in the series being a 51-46 win in Long Beach in the 2005-06 season. Long Beach State finished last year with a record of 17-15 and finished sixth in the Big West Conference with an 8-8 record.
The Bulldogs went 22-11 last season, including 13-5 in the Mountain West to take second in the conference, and reach the first round of the NCAA Tournament before losing 74-55 to Nebraska.
The last meeting between the Women of Troy and the Bulldogs ended with USC pulling out a 63-54 win in Fresno. Crook led the team with 14 points, Harberts added 13 points and 12 rebounds for her first double-double of the season, and junior guard Jordan Adams finished with 12 points, 5 rebounds, and 4 assists.
“This job is definitely far from finished, and [we have to] just be focused and ready to play, and take one game at a time,” said sophomore guard Courtney Jaco.
USC is 6-5 all-time against Fresno State, with the Bulldogs’ last win coming in Fresno in the 2012-13 season, when they won 65-60.
USC will compete in the SMU Tournament in Dallas, Texas next weekend, taking on Sam Houston State (0-1) on Friday, Nov. 28 at 3 p.m., and either SMU (1-2) or Florida A&M (0-2) on Saturday, Nov. 29 at 3 p.m. or 5 p.m. They’ll then travel to Moraga, California to face Saint Mary’s on Saturday, Dec. 6 at 5:30 p.m. before starting a seven-game homestand.

Sherlock Holmes is one of the most enduring and easily recognizable characters in Western literature. For the better part of 127 years, the adventures of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s immortal sleuth and his heterosexual life partner Dr. John Watson have captured the imagination of readers all over the world, inspiring countless films and television adaptations, influencing the development of real-life forensic science techniques and launching the popularity of the detective genre originally pioneered by Edgar Allan Poe and his 1844 short story “The Purloined Letter,” featuring Holmes’s fictional progenitor C. Auguste Dupin.

The Great Detective, known for his signature deerstalker hat, curved pipe, unparalleled powers of deduction and boredom-induced cocaine habit, is also one of the more iconic properties currently residing in the public domain, meaning anyone and everyone can publish original material featuring Holmes, Watson, the hard-headed Inspector Lestrade, the duplicitous femme fatale Irene Adler and the malevolent Professor Moriarty without paying royalties to the famously litigious Doyle estate, so long as they don’t infringe on certain elements introduced in 10 late-era Doyle tales, all of them appearing in the 1927 short story collection The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes, which are still protected under U.S. copyright law until roughly 2023.
Recently, however, the status of the character’s copyright became quite the three-pipe problem. Earlier this year, writer and attorney Leslie S. Klinger sued the Doyle estate for requiring him to pay a $5,000 licensing fee before his newest compilation of Holmes stories could be published. The collection, titled In the Company of Sherlock Holmes and co-edited by Klinger and The Beekeeper’s Apprentice author Laurie R. King, includes Doyle-inspired tales of murder and intrigue from the bestselling likes of Michael Connelly, Jeffrey Deaver and Cornelia Funke. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Klinger’s favor last June. The estate tried to appeal to the Supreme Court earlier this month, but the justices, who share Holmes’s ability to pick and choose their cases, refused to hear the heirs’ petition and summarily dismissed the case.
The court’s decision should come as a relief to the creators behind the many Holmes-related projects currently flooding our airwaves and movie theaters. Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat’s critically lauded BBC series Sherlock, which relocated Holmes and Watson from the foggy streets of Victorian England to the teeming technocracy of modern-day London and transformed Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman into the unlikeliest of household names, is expected to return for its fourth season at some point during the next two years, provided its co-stars can carve out time in their increasingly demanding schedules.
Elementary, another modernization, this one featuring British heartthrob Johnny Lee Miller as Holmes and Lucy Liu as a newly feminized Watson solving mysteries in New York City, recently began its third season on CBS, despite sagging ratings and the onus of being constantly overshadowed by the superior BBC series. The oft-rumored third installment of director Guy Ritchie’s action-heavy franchise with Robert Downey, Jr. as Holmes and Jude Law as Watson, meanwhile, appears to have stalled for now, as Downey is distracted with his various Marvel commitments and Ritchie and Law are busy prepping their medieval epic Knights of the Round Table: King Arthur.
The video game industry has also been quick to capitalize on the timeless popularity of the character. Last September saw the release of Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments, the latest installment in the award-winning series of mystery games The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Developed by Frogwares and published by Focus Home Interactive, the game, which consciously mirrors the agonizing moral dilemmas of Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment, asks the player -— -acting through Holmes himself – — to absolve or condemn suspected criminals based on factors such as circumstance and severity of offence.
For my money, though, the most promising Sherlockian tale currently in development is filmmaker Bill Condon’s Mr. Holmes, starring Sir Ian McKellen as the consulting detective, long-retired and living on his Sussex bee farm two years after the end of World War II. The plot kicks in when Holmes’s tragically deteriorating mind becomes fixated on solving old cases with the aid of his loyal housekeeper (Academy Award winner Laura Linney) and her adolescent, hero-worshipping son (Milo Parker).
The film, based on Mitch Cullin’s wonderful 2005 novel A Slight Trick of the Mind, has the potential to add something new and vital to the post-Doyle canon: a palpable sense of thematic maturity. The source material is a grand, moving treatise on the ravages of time that mourns for a bygone age of logic and civility while forcing the ultimate man of reason to confront the emotional totality of his life, including his sometimes one-sided relationship with Dr. Watson. That might sound more than a little depressing, but it’s also tremendously warm, tender and frequently funny. If Condon and McKellen imbue their big-screen adaptation with the same poignant magic they brought to Gods and Monsters, which imagined the last days of James Whale, the openly gay director of Frankenstein, the results should be fantastic.
No matter what the future holds for the residents of 221 B Baker Street, one thing is for certain: Now more than ever, the game is afoot!

It might be hard to remember that there is Japanese food in the world other than the selection of sushi at Seeds. In fact, LA is generously peppered with sushi restaurants, ramen joints and experimental Asian fusion. Necco, a cozy new Japanese fusion bistro devoted to all organic and locally sourced ingredients opened in Westwood on October 20. Necco aims to offer Japanese tapas with a twist, and for those willing to shell out a little more than usual, they succeed.
Worth the fuss · Despite small portions and expensive prices, Necco offers a high quality menu that comes in five different sections: starters, salads, big plates, small plates and sweets coupled with knowledgable service. – Photo courtesy of Necco
 
Necco, which means root in Japanese, offers a diverse menu of innovative dishes made with creative ingredients. Not to disappoint organic obsessed Angelinos, diners will be hard pressed to find anything processed at Necco – not even brand name sodas.
Located in a low key storefront on Westwood Blvd., the simple sign over the door is the only indication to the brand new Los Angeles foodie haven. Inside, the décor is sparse but trendy, with hard wood tables and a cozy bar looking into the busy kitchen within. Necco isn’t very big, and with about six different tables it offers a comfortable and cozy dining experience.
Walking in, customers are greeted by a smile from the chefs and owners working behind the bar. Though small, the staff at Necco is knowledgeable. With precise information on how the food is prepared and great recommendations on the most complimentary flavors on the menu, the staff play an important role in the dining and drinking experience.
If customers are extremely hungry, Necco may not be the best place to go. The bistro offers no on the house h’ors douevres and service can be slow. They offer a great list of starters, including veggie chips aptly named “Necco Chips” that are more flavorful than chips from the bag and somehow less greasy.
Predominantly a tapas style restaurant, the menu at Necco is divided into five different sections. The first section, starters ranges from $3.50 to $7. In addition to the hunger quelling Necco chips, the Steamed Spicy Octopus is flavorful and tender.
Following starters, Necco showcases their fresh, locally sourced produce selection under salads. These dishes offer delicious small plates of produce for affordable prices. Everything at Necco is great for sharing and the staff recommends ordering a diverse selection of salad and starters to prep the palate for the small and big plates to come.
Customers should be warned, there is not much of a difference in size between small and big plates and a collection of choices from both parts of the menu are sure to satisfy the hungriest of parties.
The Curry Flavor Nanban Chicken with fried tempeh and sweet and sour soy sauce wowed the entire table. Tender and full of flavor the chicken was the perfect choice of protein, paired with delicately flavored tempeh and a tangy sauce, the flavors worked together flawlessly for a filling fall dish. Though Necco doesn’t get an “A” for imaginative dish names, their small plates impress with flavor and innovation of texture and ingredients.
The big hit on the menu, however, is the lamb chops. Cooked perfectly and sizzling with flavor, the lamb chops have already a dozen photos on Yelp singing their praises, and they definitely deserve it.
For a student who’s looking for a hip and new fine dining experience, Necco’s Japanese-Californian fusion dinner menu does not disappoint. A meal for three with two glasses of wine came out to be just over $140, but for those who are willing to pay a little extra, it’s worth it. The food was delicious and the ingredients were fresh and though Necco does not cross into the category of affordable, it is a great choice for special occasions or for those willing to shell out a few extra dollars to be on the up and up on great new and low key eateries in Los Angeles.

It is shocking how one man’s words and the reactions to them can illustrate everything wrong with both sides of the healthcare debate.
But that’s exactly what happened when several videos featuring Jonathan Gruber, an Obama adviser who helped write the landmark Affordable Care Act, were released. At a conference a little over a year ago, Gruber said the law’s passage through government was defined by a “lack of transparency” and relied on the “stupidity of the American voter” to gain passage. More specifically though, he said the “Cadillac tax” on expensive employer-provided health insurance only was included because voters were “too stupid to understand it.”
Gruber’s comments are offensively stated, to be sure. His comment about transparency is largely off-base (public hearings were routinely held). But conservatives who have added those remarks as ammo to the “repeal Obamacare” movement, and Democrats who have pretended they don’t even know who Gruber is, have both missed an important message.
The big lesson of the “Grubergate” fiasco is not that the Affordable Care Act should be repealed, or that it’s a wonky far left policy intended to radically revamp the health care market. It’s the lesson that economists like Gruber tried to tell Democrats all along: The Affordable Care Act hasn’t gone far enough. Instead, the actual response to the videos have totally obscured the real issue, forgoing the opportunity for a teachable moment.
Here are the facts. Conservatives who opposed the Affordable Care Act have argued that it was needless and expensive government intervention into the health care market. What they and many others don’t realize is that this has been happening for years. The biggest example is the nearly $250 billion-a-year subsidy that the government distributes to individuals who get insurance through their employer. The subsidy comes in the form of an income tax break, because employers can write it off as an income tax, and that tax code lets you ignore it when calculating your taxable income. The big hypocrisy is that many who opposed the Affordable Care Act didn’t stand against this subsidy. There’s a reason that, in 2013 (before all of this blew up), the Washington Post called the subsidy “The huge health-care subsidy everyone is ignoring.”
According to Gruber (and many other economists), the tax break is a “regressive, inefficient and expensive tax subsidy.” The Affordable Care Act’s architects believed that replacing it with subsidies through the new exchanges and government plans would be both more efficient and less distortive. But they also realized that the subsidy would be hard to get rid of politically, so they created a tax on really expensive employer plans called “Cadillac” plans.
That’s where Gruber’s remarks come in. He pointed out that the tax does not increase with inflation writ large, meaning that as everything becomes more expensive (including medical insurance), eventually the “Cadillac tax” will be a tax on everyone’s employer-provided plan, a secret way of doing what had been advocated all along: ending the employer-provided subsidy. The problem is that this seems exactly like what President Obama said wouldn’t happen: “What I said and I’ve taken off the table would be … [that] you would eliminate the tax deduction that employers get for providing you with health insurance,” Obama had said at a town hall meeting on July 23, 2009 in Shaker Heights, Ohio.
To be fair, the Affordable Care Act does not eliminate the tax deduction. What it does is chip away at its leverage year by year, and replaces it with cheaper government options, the central goal of the law. Gruber’s comments remind us that what it should do beyond ending the subsidy and mandating that everyone be insured is explicitly offer a public option: a government-sponsored insurance plan that takes a substantial share of the insurance market. Such a proposal would force rates for private plans to go down and allow the government to bargain down the price of expensive drugs and medical treatments, a central problem with insurance in America.
Instead of criticizing Gruber’s comments on form, but embracing them in substance, Democrats like Nancy Pelosi chose to embarrass themselves by claiming of Gruber, “I don’t know who he is.” This ill-thought-out remark came despite the fact that Pelosi said a few years ago, “Our bill brings down rates, I don’t know if you have seen Jonathan Gruber’s MIT analysis.”
The Republican hounds pounced, and the entire debate has been stuck on it ever since, with various online outlets dubbing the fiasco “Grubergate.” Reasonable people who believe there is more to be done in health care, however, can take solace in the remarks made by former-common sense health care advocate and Republican Presidential candidate extraordinaire Mitt Romney several years ago: “Jonathan Gruber at MIT devoted hours and hours to an essential econometric model,” he said.
Looking past Gruber’s poorly phrased comments, let’s not forget that model and the potential it holds.
Nathaniel Haas is a junior majoring in political science and economics. His column, “State of the Union,” runs Fridays. 
To those that actually read the bill, it was abundantly clear that there would be many negatives. The debate was charged by sound bites. In short, logically how can a new batch of government workers cut costs? When has that ever happened? How can thousands of new regulations make things easier for insurance companies? Is threatening jail time and threatening to revok doctor’s licenses the route we want to go with healthcare? 
Democrats learned from the flame out of HillaryCare that they would have to lie about who would actually pay for Obamacare, or it would never pass.
That’s exactly what Obama did, with the main stream media carrying his water.
Democrats’ approach was to sneak a provision past “stupid”. American voters that takes away the largest individual tax deduction in IRS books, employer health premiums at 250 billion per year, and hires 16,000 IRS agents to force Americans to buy insurance. This would undoubtedly result in a “Medicaid for All” system bankrolled primarily by the middle class.
One would hope the GOP will eventually send Obama a bill that, among other things, gives the tax deduction for Heath care premiums to BOTH employer and individual policyholders to provide strong incentive to buy health care coverage. GOP has a huge mess to clean up, but at least guaranteed issue is almost certainly here to stay.
Unfortunately for Obama, a critical mass of the electorate now sees that Obamacare was quite literally the Biggest Bait and Switch in the History of the Planet.
And Hillary will be campaigning as the most politically toxic provision of all, the employer mandate, is dumping millions more who were told they could keep their plans into Obamacare. Good luck, Hillary. You are going to need it.
We know what Gruber is up to–destroy the private insurance industry and implement single-payer. When are people going to quit bowing down to big government, i.e. socialism? FOOLS!
One of the problems with the ACA, is the employer portion is called a benefit and is part of out benefits package, juse like vacation and sick days, basic life insurance, etc.
Yes, the monthly cost is doable for a lot of people, but the copay has increased in a large way that most families cannot afford to pay it, before insurance kicks in.

Drunk students, rejoice: Two new apps are here to help you save face and keep you safe.
In the last week, Drunk Locker and Drunk Mode have been receiving media attention for their efforts to curb users’ drunken mistakes. They claim to help make your night out a little less unfortunate, whether you have a tendency to call your ex, lose your friends or post regrettable Snapchat stories.
Alana Grayson | Daily Trojan
Drunk Locker, free on the Google Play store for Android, blocks Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat and Facebook Messenger when you let it know that you’re getting prepared for a night out on the town.
The app is specifically for college students, and developers hope that with the app users will “never worry again about sending out drunk messages and party all night long.” Users will have to pre-plan a bit to get this app. Its functions are turned on as soon as you let it know how many hours you plan on being drunk for, and there’s no way to turn it off until those hours have expired.
If you do sober up sooner than expected, being disconnected from a few apps for a few more hours is worth it to protect your social media accounts.
It’s a fairly well-known fact that employers have more access to your personal life than ever before because of social media. A Eurocom Worldwide study in 2012 reported that “almost one in five technology industry executives say that a candidate’s social media profile has caused them not to hire that person.”
By turning off your social media apps with Drunk Locker, you can save yourself from a tweet that could get you fired or an accidental Facebook status that could prevent you from getting hired in the first place.
Drunk Mode, free on iTunes Store or App Store, is also a new app that was created by Joshua Anton, a graduate of the University of Virginia. According to its crowdfunding page, the app is “designed to change the lives of drunk people around the world by providing you an all in one solution for the party professional for both safety and fun.” Also aimed at college students, the app has been being marketed to select colleges across the country for testing.
Similarly to Drunk Locker, you simply set how many hours you’re going to be out and turn the app on. After that, Drunk Mode will track you and your friends via GPS for as long as you’re out. If you lose your friends, simply open the app’s “Find My Drunk” feature. If you don’t remember where you went last night, check the app’s “Breadcrumbs” feature, which maps your GPS tracking.
The app might appear scarily similar to the ones helicopter moms use to stalk their children, but at least with this one, it’s your friends stalking you instead of your parents. In addition to GPS tracking, features that allow you to block certain people from your contact list (e.g. your ex or your boss) so you can’t text them during the night will be coming soon.
Drunk Mode is also developing features to be released in 2015. “Find a Ride” connects you with methods of transportation including Uber, public transportation and safe rides. “Recovery Mode” can help you recover last night’s Snapchats. “Night Time Enhancers” and “The Hype Map” help you find where to go for the best happy hours, food and guy to girl ratios. Though many of the features from Drunk Mode enable you to have a fun, less shameful night, they also have a much greater purpose: safety.
College students have been getting drunk for years, but with the recent death of a West Virginia University fraternity member and the suspension of all Greek activity on campus that followed, the country is trying to find the best solution to curb dangerous college drinking.
Each year, over 1,825 college students die from accidental, alcohol-related injuries and 97,000 students experience alcohol-related sexual assault or date rape.
The apps seem to be designed to cultivate the same kind of look-out-for-each-other spirit that UVA fostered after the disappearance of 18-year-old student, the late Hannah Graham, earlier this year.
The app encourages students to keep track of each other not only for practical purposes, but also to ensure that nobody gets left behind. Apps like Drunk Locker and Drunk Mode may not prevent heavy drinking. Some might even argue that their existence encourages students to get belligerently drunk and rely on their phones to keep them safe.
But these apps do have the potential to minimize some of the consequences of belligerent behavior.
“Students will party. This will not change. It is the nature of being young in college to want to be a bit ‘rebellious’ and do crazy stuff. All we are trying to do is create an easy button for certain questions,” Anton said in an interview with the Huffington Post.
Keeping students from posting on social media or talking to people they shouldn’t talk to at 2 a.m. protects their dignity and professional lives. Giving students a tool to responsibly track their friends has the potential to save lives.
If you can get over the necessity to pre-plan and let your friends stalk you, these apps could save you some next-morning or even rest-of-your-life regret.

Facebook and Instagram’s no-nudity policies are enforced inconsistently. Some breastfeeding photos or historical paintings have been removed from the sites, while Kim Kardashian’s infamous recent nude shoot have been everywhere on both platforms.
Though it might seem impossible to have non-sexual nude images in a society that objectifies women and sexualizes children, the definition of pornography goes beyond nudity. Pornography must contain two components: sexual organs or activity, and the intention to stimulate erotic feelings.
When women post photos of themselves breastfeeding, they intend to evoke emotional responses.
Museums post images of nude sculptures or paintings for artistic value. And when Chelsea Handler posts her naked body on the Internet, she does so for comedic effect.
Handler herself made the distinction in the caption of one of her Instagram posts. “Just so I’m clear, Instagram,” she wrote. “It’s ok to use nudity to sexualize yourself on your site, but not to make a joke? I’m just so confused.”
Yet, when Kim Kardashian (of sex tape fame) posts her greased and perhaps Photoshopped body on the Internet with a faux-surprised smirk, the intentions are less clear. Is this art? Is this pornography? That may depend on who is looking at the photo. Whether or not this image holds social value is up to you.
That Facebook and Instagram chose not to ban Kim Kardashian’s image is not shocking. They must feel it holds artistic value. But Instagram chooses to see artistic or social value in a greased body and not historic art, breast-feeding or humor.
It could be argued that society today sexualizes all nude images of women, whether or not they are provocative in nature. In fact, the recent street-harassment video indicates women are sexualized whether they are clothed or not.
By keeping sexual images and removing those that hold social value, these social media sites send a clear message to today’s youth that use them daily: women’s bodies exist to be sexually stimulating, and if they are not serving that purpose they should be removed from sight.
A recent Daily Trojan article argued Kim Kardashian’s recent photo contributes to young women’s eating disorders and body shame. Beyond that, her photo also encourages the self-objectification that many powerful women today in pop culture partake in for power, at the cost of being ignored for talents beyond having a hot body.
But Chelsea Handler’s images do neither of those things. Handler is un-Photoshopped, looks more like the average American body than Kardashian’s altered images do, and best of all, prove the female body can have a purpose beyond sexuality.
She inspires a generation of young comedians who wonder why male comedians can use nudity and sex for humor but women cannot. Not only are Handler’s images non-sexual, but they also serve a dual purpose: comedy and female empowerment beyond objectification.

USC head swimming and diving coach Dave Salo has been named USA’s national women’s head coach for the 2015 FINA World Championships. The meet is scheduled for July 24- Aug. 9 in Kazan, Russia.
Salo is entering his ninth season as head coach of USC’s men’s and women’s swimming and diving programs. He will serve alongside Cal’s head coach Dave Durden, who will coach the USA’s men’s national team. 
This is the second time that Salo will direct the women’s national team at Worlds, as he coached the team in 2013 in Barcelona. Salo’s 2013 team included Olympic gold medalists Missy Franklin and Katie Ledecky. His team won a tournament-best nine gold medals.
Salo has coached in three Olympic games and served as an assistant coach to the women’s national team in the 2012 Olympics, helping his team win eight gold medals. In 2010 he was inducted into the American Swimming Coaches Association Hall of Fame. 
Salo earned his Ph.D. from USC after earning his undergraduate and master’s degree from Long Beach State. Salo returned to USC as an assistant coach under Peter Daland. In 1990, Salo took a head coaching job with the Irvine Novaquatics. 
While head coach of the Novaquatics, Salo coached his team to the Junior National Team Championships and the United States Swimming National Championships. Salo returned to USC, this time as head coach, in 2006. 
In his time at USC, Salo has regularly coached his team to title contention, routinely securing a place in the top 10. The 2014 NCAA Championships saw the women’s team finish fifth and the men’s team finish eighth. It was the fifth consecutive top-seven finish for USC’s women’s team. 
The men’s team boasts an undefeated 4-0 record to start this season while the women are 3-1. All wins are in conference.
