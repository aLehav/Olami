At No. 24, USC is one spot lower on the 2013 U.S. News and World Report National University Rankings, which were released Tuesday night.
USC tied with UCLA, which ranked No. 25 last year, and University of Virginia for the No. 24 spot. Harvard University and Princeton University tied for first.
Though the U.S. News and World Report is a respected publication, some experts believe it does not correctly reflect a university’s quality.
Jerome Lucido, a research professor of education at the USC Rossier School of Education, said the university’s position on the list provides little to no indication of the quality of the school.
“The U.S. News rankings only gives an illusion that institutional quality can be measured, and there’s way too much emphasis placed on these rankings,” Lucido said. “It creates competition over categories that, at best, only reflect educational quality instead of actually measuring it.”
U.S. News and World Report bases its rankings on 16 criteria, including freshmen retention, acceptance rates, graduation rates and strength of the faculty. Each criterion is then given a specific weight in an overall formula that is determined by a subjective assessment of how much it matters. A final weighted composite score for each school allows it to be ranked and compared to other universities.
According to the website, the list is based on these quantitative measures, along with the publication’s own “researched view of matters in education.”
Katherine Strashnov, a sophomore majoring in fine arts, says that the rankings are helpful in determining which universities are competitive in their academics, a fact that might be relevant once students enter the job market.
“I pay attention to rankings because when you’re looking for jobs, employers want to see that the school you graduated from has a solid reputation and gave you a great education,” Strashnov said. “Ranking schools is the easiest way to tell where a school stands and therefore, where a potential employee stands compared to others.”
Lucido, however, suggests that ranking universities might be detrimental to students just entering college because it reinforces the idea that high school seniors must earn admission to a top-ranked university. Lucido believes this leads students to focus on a ranking over choosing a school that might be best suited for them.
“Institutions exacerbate the problem by touting their rankings, which in reality are only meaningful in terms of bragging rights,” Lucido said.
In an explanation of how they calculate the “Best Colleges” rankings, U.S. News says that their data is meant to be used in conjunction with students’ own intuition while selecting a college.
Kenneth Mang, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said he believes that the criteria used to rank universities cannot be applied to accurately rate one school over another.
“USC is a very well-rounded school,” he said. “I don’t think these rankings can measure a lot of the things that make this university so great.”
Some students, however, said they believe the lists are necessary because it is important for people to have a sense of a university’s reputation.
“It’s a necessary process because nothing is completely fair. Just because a few schools sometimes feel like it’s unfair doesn’t mean it should be completely eliminated,” said Lexine Cudjoe, a junior majoring in political science. “We need a way to measure a school’s worth.”
Still, Cudjoe couldn’t help but be annoyed to be ranked at the same level as UCLA.
“It sucks to be the same level as your rival,” Cudjoe said. “A lot of people say USC pays their way up there. But with all this money we should be able to equip our students in such a way that we deserve a higher ranking.”
Thanks for deleting my comments, DT–loser lapdogs!
“Kenneth Mang, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said he believes that the criteria used to rank universities cannot be applied to accurately rate one school over another.”-This.
All universities that participate in this pecking order game SELF-REPORT their data i.e. “strength of faculty, admission rates, retention, research,” etc. You got to be gullible to take rankings seriously. Everybody fudges their stats. Nobody is SELF-REPORTING with absolute honesty.
Only an HONEST Appraisal can determine REAL Value.

Starting Thursday, paper tickets will no longer be sold at Expo Line stations. Instead, passengers will only be able to purchase reusable Transit Access Pass cards in order to ride the line.
Carded · Annette Gomez, a freshman majoring in gerontology, uses her Transit Access Pass at a station along the Expo Line. Beginning Thursday, TAP cards will replace all paper tickets. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
Ticket vending machines will no longer sell paper tickets and passengers will instead purchase TAP cards for a one-time $1 fee. These plastic payment cards allow Metro users to buy and electronically load Metro passes, participating transit line passes and cash directly to their card.
Exclusive use of TAP cards is part of Metro’s transition to include locked turnstiles in all subway and rail stations.
Come November, Metro Rail will also begin the process of locking turnstiles, including those at the Expo Line stations near USC. Tapping a TAP card on a turnstile will simultaneously unlock the gate and charge the train’s fare.
The process started last winter, Metro spokesperson Anna Chen said. After conducting a 10-week gate locking test along the Red Line, Metro slowly began converting all ticket vending machines to TAP card machines, a process that will be completed by early next month. Pending approval from its board of directors, Metro will begin to incorporate the locked turnstiles starting in November.
“If all goes as scheduled, this should be completed by May of next year,” Chen said.
Many stations currently use unlocked turnstiles that allow passengers to enter without tapping their TAP card. Though the fine for fare evasion is up to $250, Chen said this has not stopped some users from taking advantage of the unguarded system.
“Fare evasion is definitely something we want to discourage,” Chen said. “For a $1.50 flat rate, our fares are the lowest in the nation. There’s no reason why people shouldn’t pay the fare.”
Chen believes Los Angeles is finally catching up to other big cities by locking turnstiles.
“This is something that should have happened a while ago,” Chen said. “If you take the subway in New York or Chicago, the gates are locked. It should be that way here in Los Angeles.”
The first station set to feature locked turnstiles is the Wilshire/Normandie Station on the Purple Line. Depending on the response, Metro hopes to continue locking the remaining stations until they are all secure. The stations will continue to be unguarded, but Metro staff will be available to assist new TAP users.
The Expo Line stations near USC are not currently equipped with turnstiles but now feature the new TAP system. Anisha Veer, a junior majoring in business administration, thinks the TAP card makes using Metro more convenient.
“It makes it easier for people to travel on the Metro,” Veer said. “The TAP card is great for me because I’m a frequent Metro user and this way I don’t have to wait in line to get a ticket. I use it for the Expo Line, but I can use it for other lines as well.”
Other students,  like freshman communication major Matt Cheung, see even more potential in the card.
“In Hong Kong, they have a similar card called the Octopus that is used for the metro, buses, airport shuttles and [convenience] stores,” Cheung said. “One thing I think TAP could work on is integration with privatized companies like Zipcar and Prime Time Shuttle, which would make things a lot easier.”
Regardless of the potential drawbacks some see in the new system, others said the Metro is a useful took for students.
“The Metro [system] is something all students should learn how to use, especially in a big city like Los Angeles, not just for a matter of convenience, but as a safety precaution as well,” said Isabel Lemon, a sophomore majoring in theater. “I know which line I need to take to get back to USC from wherever I am.”
Looking forward, an investment in a TAP card could be a smart choice for USC students, especially those without cars. For students, Metro offers a college/vocational TAP card. The card, priced at $36, allows unlimited rides for 30 days, including on the Expo Line, which goes between Downtown Los Angeles and Culver City.
“I really hope the line from Culver City to Santa Monica finishes soon,” Veer said. “Then USC students can get to Santa Monica in 30 minutes.”
Starting next month, Metro stations will only accept TAP cards.

I don’t like the idea of TAP card only. People should be given the option to take the Metro even if they are not a frequent user of the Metro system. I’m from the Bay, and our BART system has both the paper ticket option and the Clipper Card option. Visitors that use the system only a few times in the year will more likely appreciate a simple paper ticket and not have an extra card that lies dormant most of the year. Yes, encourage the TAP card, but please do not make it the only option.
Turnstyles are definitely an improvement that is needed. When I first saw the system, I was amazed that you can simply walk onto the platform, with or without your ticket.
As a Southern Californian, I agree with your comments.
I presently use a paper Senior EZ Pass which will be issued for Seniors through October.
I have an ORANGE Tap Card with my photo which expires early next year to be used for both TAP and the new sticker which I will be affixed when I buy my November Senior EZ Pass, etc.
The sticker will be used for those non-tap systems, i.e., Torrance, Long Beach and Santa Monica, etc.  Right now, in Culver City, I just show my EZ Pass and most drivers know me.
Starting in November, I will have to TAP according to my many contacts with Culver CityBus (that is the way it is spelled).
BTW, i am familiar with BARTD (FULL NAME) but haven’t been on it for some years.
A long-time friend of mine served on its Board of Directors for a while.
My previovs comment referred to Bob’s comments.
In regards the Gregorio comments on Torrance and Long Beach, ALL agencies will be accepting  TAP WITH A SPECIAL STICKER starting in Nouember.

The previous comment has nothing to do with TAP as far as I can tell.
I am an EXPO rider but not a USC student.
Why not have Long Beach Transit and the Torramce Tansit Buses also accept TAP Cards?  They are the only ones that don’t I think. Thank you.
Seems we are going in the wrong direction here.
With hard financial times, we were supposed to be able to leverage the genorocity of our benefactors and expand our lead over the State schools and to cut into the lead of the Schools rated ahead of us.
Not happening–something fundamental is wrong with Nikias’ approach. Maybe more time behind the desk and less time in the football locker room is a good start. 
The 24/7 huckerstering needs to stop and be replaced by substance. 
While the administration/beaurocracy has grown exponentially, along with the number of students admitted to USC (the student body is now at 38,000–up from 32,000 a few years ago) the class size has gotten much larger and the tuition has increased and the quality is not keeping up with our competitors.
What’s going on, Mr. Nikias?

Dept. of Public Safety Chief Carey Drayton applied for a position as University of Tennessee’s police chief earlier this year but was not hired, according to documents released by UT.
On an evaluation page of the four finalists for the position, Drayton was the only candidate the search committee circled as “unacceptable,” according to the UT documents.
Drayton said this week he was satisfied UT chose someone else for the position.
“It was a good decision for me ’cause I want to be here at USC,” he said in a phone interview Tuesday.
Drayton, who has worked as DPS chief for six years, applied for the UT position Feb. 17 and was one of four finalists, according to the UT documents. Drayton said he was asked by officials at UT to apply for the position. UT received more than 60 applicants, according to the UT documents.
The UT search committee, in a bulleted list, cited as Drayton’s weaknesses: “condescending arrogance (rubbed some the wrong way),” “lack of reliability,” “appears to work well with higher-ups but not lower-levels,” “controversy,” “too big picture (lack of respect for detail)” and “lack of stability,” according to the UT documents.
“That’s people’s opinions, right, and I don’t have a comment on their opinions,” Drayton said.
Though the university could not comment on private personnel issues, Charlie Lane, associate vice president for career and protective services, said Drayton has worked effectively during his time at USC.
“USC cannot discuss private employment matters publicly, but I will say that Chief Drayton has worked extremely hard and served USC well,” Lane wrote in an email.
For Drayton’s strengths, the UT search committee, in a bulleted list, cited: “higher education experience,” “worked large events,” “experience with accreditation,” “knows the business” and “could be likable,” according to the UT documents.
Though USC knew that the UT committee did not select Drayton, university officials were unaware of his evaluation, according to Lane.
“We are only aware that the committee chose not to move forward with Chief Drayton as a candidate,” Lane wrote in an email.
The UT documents, which include references, letters and summaries of interviews, were obtained by the Knoxville News Sentinel under an open records request, and the paper agreed to share the documents with the Daily Trojan.
In his application letter, which is included in the UT documents, Drayton wrote: “This position offers the ideal setting for this stage in my career because of the name and reputation of the University of Tennessee, and it’s location in the country.”
The committee met for a final time May 14, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel. The university announced May 30 that it had chosen the police chief at the University of Wyoming as its new head of police.
Drayton was hired at USC as assistant chief of DPS in November 2005 and was promoted to chief and executive director of DPS in January 2006, according to the DPS website.
USC instituted a pre-employment screening policy in 2000 that includes background and reference checks, according to Lane. Drayton received the same screening as all other university hires, Lane said.
“His employment record, references, and performance on the job were all taken into consideration when the decisions were made to hire and subsequently promote him,” Lane wrote in an email.
Before coming to USC, Drayton spent 10 years as Florida State University’s police chief.   Drayton resigned from FSU three months before coming to USC, citing a need to help his mother who had cancer, according to documents released by FSU to the Daily Trojan.
Though Drayton formally resigned, FSU’s senior vice president of finance and administration, John Carnaghi, was documented as saying in one reference to the UT search committee that he asked Drayton to leave the university. The UT documents show that Carnaghi told the UT search committee that he made that decision after he learned of a paternity suit that was filed against Drayton by another FSU employee.
Drayton and the child’s mother reached a settlement under which Drayton accepted paternity and agreed to pay child support, according to case documents from the Leon County Clerk’s Office in Tallahassee. Carnaghi said Drayton never disclosed the suit to him, according to the UT documents.
The UT interviewer asked Carnaghi a series of questions. The UT documents provide the following account of Carnaghi’s final comments:
“When [Carnaghi] checked into [the paternity suit] and confronted the chief, [Drayton] admitted that it was true and that he and his wife worked it out and that he decided not to tell anyone about it. [Carnaghi] had a major concern about why [Drayton] did not tell him, said that he thought that they had a wonderful relationship. He told the chief that he would have to leave because he would no longer be effective at addressing issues once this was discovered. He also said this tarnished [Drayton’s] decision making in his view. He ended by saying that he was an excellent chief that did a lot of good for the university … but he made a decision that no one could understand that cost him his position.”
Carnaghi was out of town and did not respond to an email request for comment.
When asked about the circumstances of leaving FSU, Drayton referred to his formal letter of resignation, which cited his mother’s illness as his reason for leaving.
Lane said USC was not aware of all the circumstances around Drayton’s departure, but the university was aware of the paternity suit at the time of the hire.
“This has had no bearing on his performance on the job,” Lane said.
John Martin, FSU’s assistant vice president for administration from 1993 to 1998, told the UT search committee that he would hire Drayton again, according to his reference in the UT documents.  “If you asked if I would ever hire him again, I would say yes,” Martin was documented as saying in his reference. “But, I would have to ask and find out what in the world he was thinking on the personal decision issue.”
Dan Murphy, chairman of the UT search committee, did not respond to an interview request from the Daily Trojan.
In 2003, Drayton was the subject of an FSU investigation into six allegations.
According to a report from FSU’s chief audit officer, four of the allegations were unsubstantiated and two were partially substantiated. The report partially substantiated an allegation that background checks were improperly approved for officers that Drayton wanted to hire. Drayton did not sign off on the background checks himself. In addition, the report said “inappropriate pictures and a movie” were found on computers used by Drayton, but investigators could not determine who had placed them there.
“I don’t remember those investigations, quite honestly,” Drayton said Tuesday. “That was in 2003.”
After the investigation, Paul Strouts, an associate vice president at FSU, wrote a memo to Drayton, according to the FSU documents.
“As we discussed, the great majority of these allegations were without merit,” Strouts wrote in the memo on FSU stationery. “They do, however, serve as a clear reminder that someone in your position necessarily needs to be held to a very high standard. I know that you understand this and will continue to conduct yourself accordingly.”
 
Chelsea Stone and Alexis Driggs contributed to this report.
Has anyone thought that this was UT’s effort to successfully embarrass a USC official? The University of Tennessee was so enraged when Lane Kiffin left their football program I wouldn’t put it past them to intentionally “invite” Chief Drayton to apply with the complete purpose of embarrassing a USC officer. Why else would they send a copy of his application to the Daily Trojan.  The ultimate disappointment is that DT “reporters” fell for the trick.  If the UT Sentinel was genuinely concerned about our Chief’s leadership shouldn’t that information have gone to the Chief’s superior, Charlie Lane, rather than USC’s TRASHpaper?
I’m going to side with the author. This article was compelling, and it provides insight into the administration of the university. DPS has problems, and this story gives a well-researched and interesting view of some of the important (and inept) figures behind it.
The comment from the DPS employee is based on emotion and is grossly inaccurate.  The Department of Public Safety does not hire individuals from other agencies who have been terminated for employee issues.  To state that DPS field personnel lack the proper knowledge is to insult the fine men and women in the department who have dedicated themselves to serving the university community.  All staff hired into the Department of Public Safety must pass rigorous backround screening, including possessing the required knowledge and experience in order to be hired for the position.  When you see a Department of Public Safety officer, know that they have undergone a lengthy process in order to be of service here.  It might be a good idea to thank them for the hard work they do to keep you safe each and every day.
Slow day for the DT?
This doesn’t read as a tabloid to me–a tabloid would focus much more on the fact that he was involved in a paternity suit and sensationalized the fact that he wasn’t chosen for a new job. Maybe it even would have emphasized that he wanted to leave USC. This article, however, highlighted that our head of campus safety (what I consider to be one of the most important jobs on campus, especially in light of all the crime that goes on in this area on top of normal college campus problems) was the ONLY applicant considered ‘unacceptable’ at another higher education institution. If it had just said ‘he didn’t get the job’, THAT is tabloid gossip. This is saying that he’s “unacceptable” to another school, which might conceivably be a warning sign for us. This is a good article that has been meticulously researched and presented in a straightforward manner. I’m not entirely sure what kind of tabloids you’re reading, but based on your condemnation of this they must have better articles than half of the actual ‘news’ pieces that I read nowadays. Thank you, DT.
I want to know if the reporters Annalise or Daniel ever had a situation where their boyfriend or girlfriend called them a liar. Since they are reporters for our University, the public has a right to know if even in their personal lives, their veracity has been questioned. This is the same set of rules about exposing the truth as it pertains to a person’s ability to do their job and what is just diggng into personal matters. Annalise and Daniel made these rules so they should live by it now.
Katherine, if you really want to parse why Drayton was deemed “unacceptable” to Tenn but acceptable to USC, then perhaps the reporters needed to investigate the hiring practices, standards and criteria of the two universities, which they did not.
@ Ras,
What do you have against gay people?   You sound like a complete bigot!
Wow. Just wow. This story serves no purpose and is really quite offensive. Certainly a huge disgrace to the journalistic integrity of the Daily Trojan. This whole comment string really shows that the paper as a whole (and surely its oversight) has come downhill lately.
Let the boys plays and let the people speak. Part of working for in a public position is, well, having your information open to the public. Comes with the territory. There’s perks to to being police chief too, don’t let anyone convince there isn’t. The paper just took this information and spread it through the channels, like an objective paper is supposed to do…chill pill guys.
Yes, so then fair is fair and Annalise and Daniel are both basically proclaiming their own personal lives are open for scrutiny since they also work for the university in a public manner. Let’s see how they feel when a disgruntled boyfriend or girlfriend or coworker bring personal dirt to the public discourse and lets see Annalise and Daniel decry how that kind of smut has no bearing on their abilities as journalists. I am sure the Chief has similar sentiments right now… That kind of hypocrisy is so hilariously not understood by self entitled, self important SC students that are used to a sheltered life protected by mommy and daddy. I do not envy these reporters…they basically gave the public an open license to judge all personal aspects of their own lives.
Disgusting article to publish something like that. The attacking and childish nature of it. And wow was it boring. Hope the writer is not a journalist major.
Free Speech you A-holes!
Of course free speech. But the paper should have some oversight and not publish stupid stuff like this. It’s a pathetic attempt at “journalism” and it is embarrassing to the USC community and unfair the the Cheif.
I am ashamed that an article like this was allowed to be printed under USC’s name. Public safety is obviously a very important issue at this school, but this article does nothing to link extremely personal details about Chief Drayton to campus safety. Instead, this article reads like a tabloid. The Daily Trojan could use a reminder that it is a UNIVERSITY institution, not a reality TV show. A staff or faculty’s personal life should not be a source of entertainment or scandal for students. The students who wrote this article should also take a moment to consider that Chief Drayton, along with the rest of DPS, is at this school to protect us as students so we can enjoy our time here in safety. I am appalled that the writers and editors of this article have senselessly humiliated a man who has dedicated his life to protecting them. Shame on you all.
I echo the sentiment that many above have expressed regarding this piece. It’s so sad as to be funny, (bathetic in fact (shout out to Dr. Green)). I can only hope that, in the future, while the DT goes about discrediting people, they maintain their own credibility. 
While I stand by what I have said above, I do hope that the community continues to give the DT a chance. Just like the dissenters point out, people make mistakes, and this mistake of an article could be a great learning opportunity for Annalise and Daniel. I have come to expect better quality material, especially that co-authored by a law student. 
Or the DT could become the SChallot and compete with the Onion.
what the christ. does the daily trojan have any sort of oversight?
Character counts, especially for those who lead Departments of Public Safety.  Clearly, Chief Drayton is no straight arrow.  Although many commenters say they dislike this kind of journalism, I think it’s important to know who is leading our security team at the university.  The student reporters obtained this information from public, reliable sources, not from some disgruntled underling.  I applaud their efforts in shedding light on his less-than-stellar character.
The DT is not a tabloid. A tabloid is exactly where this story belongs. Of all things, you used this kind of a story to ruin your relationship with a vital source? If you’re going to hurt that relationship, at least do it with a worthwhile story.
If I was Chief Drayton I would seek the advice of an ambitious attorney and sue The University of Tennessee for submitting personally damaging subjective comments from an employment interview as well as the unprofessional University administrator that would submit such comments to a newspaper. 
I would also sue the Daily Trojan, its student reporters, as well as it’s editor (lack of appropriate oversight of immature students) for its malicious attack on a person’s career.   
Annalise and Daniel, it is you and the rest of the student body that the Chief and his team strives to protect and instead of focusing on his job performance, you choose to serve up some personal “dirt” that belongs in a gossip rag, not a University newspaper.
As for the comment from “DPS Employee”–sounds like typical disgruntled current or former employee vitriol.
Remember this article when you go out into the big, bad world of employment and suddenly your own Facebook and Twitter accounts, phone and text records become fair game for judgement.
I agree this article smacks more of TMZ then DT…I guess that means Annalise, Daniel and the DT Editors all agree their personal lives are also up for public scrutiny since they also work for the University and as the University journalists, should they get blemishes on their personal relationships, the public also deserves to have it aired out in the open since the reporters are proclaiming it is the public’s right to know…
That said, i don’t think a white, heterosexual, middle aged man with the same qualifications as Drayton would ever get a top, executive position of a department at USC. Drayton fits the bill for USC’s love of beating the diversity drum. It is sad because this “news” story pulls forward so many different types of hypocrisy on so many levels.
As a new freshman member of the Trojan family, I was excited to hear that our school had its own newspaper – until I began to read articles such as this one. While some might consider this story news, people with dignity and common sense would simply consider it an opinionated rant on a staff member of the University for no good reason.
As opposed to promoting the good, world-class research and discoveries that come out of USC, this story simply attempts to shoot down a school official whose personal life has absolutely nothing to do with his professional one – and it crosses the line between quality journalism and journalistic nonsense. Therefore, as opposed to promoting the good news that comes out of our school each day, the Daily Trojan is simply needlessly running articles such as this one which serve no good purpose to anyone. When I read a NEWS article, I expect it to keep me informed on what’s actually going on, not attempt to influence me and get me to dislike someone for no good reason – that’s what sensationalistic tabloids are for, and I thought the Daily Trojan was better than that.
As I look back to one of the earlier Daily Trojan issues published when school started, Editor Sean Fitz-Gerald even said, “I want the DT to be the sounding board for USC. I want us to be relevant to you. I want our papers to crowd your desk at home or in your dorm room. […] Tell us what you want covered. Tell us what you want more of. And — perhaps most importantly — tell us what we’re doing wrong and why.” While his wishes might be genuine, stories such as this one are what unnecessarily  tarnish the reputation of the school and of the Daily Trojan.
This story is simply pointless and this type of essentially “rubbish” journalism that comes from the Daily Trojan needs to come to an end. As the Professor touched upon above, it’s time to ask when the Daily Trojan will take responsibility for its errors.
Dear Annalise and Daniel,
I realize you are students, so please continue to learn.  It is not news that a candidate for a position did not resonate with the selection committee.  It is very inappropriate to print comments from interviews in this manner.  It is very rare that a candidate for a position leaves the interview process without some negative comments.   That may be due to differences in style, expectations, philosophy, etc.  Your motives are unclear in writing this piece, but the objective reader could conclude that you are biased against the Chief and want to move others to your position.  Your passing, almost dismissive, comment about his mother’s cancer makes it seem like an insufficient reason to leave his position and, instead, you give tremendous weight to the child he is now caring for.  We all make errors in judgment at some point in our lives.  The question is how we respond to those errors.  It appears that the Chief took responsibility for his—will you take responsibility for yours?
I know  suggesting some adult supervision for  DT writers and editors would cause questions about journalistic integrity and editorial Independence.  But after “articles” like this, one wonders if there is any journalistic integrity left to lose.  Perhaps supervision would be the wrong direction, how about finding a mentor or advisory group who could help raise standards at the DT?
This is embarrassing and disappointing work.  Trojans should be better than this.
Agreeing with the two above. This is a pathetic excuse for journalism. Spare the USC community your pointless rants on an individual’s personal life.
100% Agree with the comment above. This man is representing SC at this moment, how is this helpful with all the great changes we have in mind? I’m sure there is an explanation behind but if this article does nothing other than cause laughter and embarassment than you FAILED! Let’s see what evolves from this.
Congratulations Editors!  You have officially taken the DT to a new low.  No respectable newspaper would print such drivel.  What is the news here—that the Chief was not hired for a job and that he had a baby with someone many years ago?  The only purpose of this article is to try and embarrass an individual.  It is so clear that you have a personal ax to grind with this person and you are using your paper to get back at him.  This kind of tabloid journalism is below USC and, I thought, below the DT.  Clearly I was wrong on that second part.  The editors and author have bright futures at the National Enquirer or at one of the many gossip web sites that purport to tell the news.  One day you will apply for a job and I can only hope that the negative comments of those who interview you will be published in the newspaper.  Perhaps the company you apply to will question your judgment when they learned you published such trash.  You have successfully embarrassed USC for no good reason.  Way to go DT!!!

Some USC fans bit their nails throughout the Trojans’ 42-29 win over Syracuse last Saturday — after all, they led the Orange by just five points entering the fourth quarter and ended up being outgained in total yardage, 455 to 445.
Even worse, senior center Khaled Holmes left the game with an injury, and though he is still listed as the starter for this week’s game at Stanford, it’s hard to forget he left MetLife Stadium on a cart.
But compared to the problems that have surfaced for other Pac-12 contenders over the first couple weeks of the season, USC might not have too much cause for concern.
Utah quarterback Jordan Wynn, the only other player besides Matt Barkley entering his fourth year as quarterback in the Pac-12, retired from football Monday after suffering another serious shoulder injury in the Utes’ stunning overtime loss to Utah State last weekend. It was Wynn’s fourth shoulder injury in the last three years.
With Wynn directing their offense, the Utes were picked to finish second in the Pac-12 South in the conference’s preseason media poll.
But after losing to in-state rival Utah State for the first time in 15 years while averaging only 2.3 yards per carry and allowing Wynn to be sacked three times, it will take a big turnaround for the Utes to qualify for a bowl for the tenth year in a row.
Washington, led by touted gunslinger Keith Price, was a trendy preseason pick to disturb the Oregon-Stanford status quo atop the North division. Some of those bets were surely hedged after a slogging 21-12 win over San Diego State in their season opener, but Price promised the Huskies would bring their “A-game” in their week two matchup against LSU.
Naturally, the Huskies were promptly throttled 41-3 by the Bayou Bengals. Price completed less than half of his passes while throwing for just 157 yards, no touchdowns and an interception. Washington also gained 26 yards on 24 carries. “A-game,” indeed.
You’d think we could expect some consistency from Stanford, which has recently become a perennial contender for the Pac-12 crown.
But even the Cardinal disappointed in its home opener against San Jose State, which makes a habit of getting walloped by power conference teams in its first game of the season.
From 2009-11, the Spartans gave up an average of 53.6 points against USC, Alabama and Stanford while mustering only a field goal in each blowout defeat. But this year, the Spartans marched into Palo Alto and gave Stanford a legitimate scare, outgaining the Cardinal in total yardage while falling valiantly 20-17.
Some say that Stanford redeemed itself last weekend with a 50-13 rout at home over Duke. But trust me, after living 30 minutes from Duke for 10 years, beating the Blue Devils — no matter the score — is nothing to get excited about.
Stanford’s defensive front seven allowed the Spartans’ offense to move down the field methodically and chew time off the clock in their upset bid. We’ll see this weekend if Stanford has the staying power to continue their program’s resurgence.
And that leaves Oregon. There’s no doubt that USC’s success will be defined by their game — or games — against the Ducks this season.And though our rivals from Eugene, Ore., haven’t shown any chinks in the armor yet, it was announced this week that they lost a pair of three-year starters for the rest of the season. Offensive lineman Carson York (fractured kneecap) and free safety John Boyett (knee surgery) have both likely played their last snaps as Ducks.
Realistically, as long as they still have running backs De’Anthony Thomas and Kenjon Barner creating havoc through the no-huddle offense, they’ll be a threat in the Pac-12. But like USC, their depth on defense has to be considered an issue after allowing an average of 29.5 points to Arkansas State and Fresno State.
The same issues that threaten to interrupt USC’s dream season — depth and inexperience on the defensive line — still remain. And a few more have emerged, with the injuries to Holmes and kicker Andre Heidari.
But can any team in the Pac-12 expose those flaws?

While I agree that the pre-season picks of Utah as a Pac-12 darkhorse now seem absurd, you have only discussed 4 of the other 11 teams. How can you ignore the impressive performances–against quality opponents–by UCLA, Arizona, Arizona State, and Oregon State (even if we don’t face the Beavers this year)? The Pac-12 South, in particular, suddenly looks a LOT tougher this year, no matter how bad Utah looks. The Pac-12 is no longer USC-Oregon and the “others”. This article needed to address more than just 4 teams who look to have been over-hyped if it is intended to address “Pac-12 Competitors” as a group.

The Pac-12 opener against Stanford this Saturday evokes some grim memories for USC. Perhaps the worst come from the midseason showdown at home last October, when the Trojans came close to upsetting the then-No. 4 Cardinal but fell in a 48-56 triple-overtime thriller.
Lesson learned · In 2011, senior safety T.J. McDonald committed a costly personal foul late in regulation that led to a Stanford touchdown. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Though few could blame the Trojans for wanting to exact revenge, No. 2 USC (2-0, 0-0) insists that those thoughts are not motivating the team come Saturday.
“[Luck] came out there and did what he did, but that was last year, and this year will be totally different,” junior cornerback Nickell Robey said.
Robey nearly won that game for the Trojans with an interception he returned 33 yards for a touchdown that gave USC a 34-27 lead with 3:08 remaining in regulation.
“I thought the game was going to be over at that point,” Robey said.
Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck then engineered a final scoring drive that tied the game, and three overtimes later, Stanford won their 16th straight game.
The rest of the team is trying to join Robey in his mindset: Move on from last year, and on Saturday, play even harder.
One of the players who has embraced such a mentality is senior safety T.J. McDonald. The 2011 Pac-12 first-team selection was called for a personal foul on a third-and-out that kept Stanford’s game-tying drive alive.
“Everything is in the past for me,” McDonald said. “Our coaches are going to put us in the position to make plays like they do every week. It will all come down to execution on Saturday.”
USC coach Lane Kiffin commented on some of the team’s defensive strategies for a Cardinal pro-style offense that now relies on running back Stepfan Taylor, but stopped short of going into great detail.
“We’re going to have to stop the run. We’ll have to play aggressive and really knock them back,” Kiffin said. “We have to play some really sound defense against these guys.”
One of the key players for USC’s run defense will be junior defensive end Morgan Breslin, who transferred from Diablo Valley Junior College in the spring.
Breslin has received a lot of recognition for his strong pass rushing skills in his two Division I games, but he still needs to prove he can withstand a stout Pac-12 running attack.
“I’m very impressed for him to come in his first Division I college game and make as many plays as he has. He’s been huge for us — probably our biggest surprise,” Kiffin said.
Breslin has 10 total tackles and two sacks as a starter and has helped fill the void left by senior defensive end Devon Kennard, who may be out for the season with a pectoral injury.
Stanford will no longer have the luxury of Luck’s passing, but Kiffin still anticipates a tough matchup against the Cardinal in Palo Alto, Calif.
“Every year is new,” Kiffin said. “Every team is new. We got to play really well on the road, versus a team that is really well-coached and is hard to beat. That’s why they’ve won a lot of games over the last couple of years.”

No. 2 USC will face No. 21 Stanford with a 2-0 record, but not without something to prove at the cornerback position. Last week against Syracuse, USC surrendered 322 passing yards and two touchdown passes.
Wild card · Kiffin has praised junior cornerback Torin Harris as a player with NFL potential. Harris, who has one career interception, is listed as a co-starter on Saturday’s depth chart. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
 
Going into the season, the Trojans had hoped to see improved play at the cornerback position, as every scholarship cornerback from last season returned. Toward the end of fall camp, however, senior Isiah Wiley, who started six games last year, was ruled academically ineligible for the season. Wiley had 39 tackles and four pass deflections in 2011, along with a fumble recovery in USC’s win over Oregon in November.
Though Wiley’s presence could have strengthened the secondary — a unit that allowed 263.3 passing yards per game and a 63.9 opponent’s completion percentage in 2011 — junior cornerback Nickell Robey believes saying Wiley’s absence has hurt the team would be “a robbery to the guys that are out here busting their tails.”
Against Hawai’i, redshirt sophomore Anthony Brown earned the majority of Wiley’s presumed playing time opposite Robey, although senior Brian Baucham and freshman Kevon Seymour also played several defensive series.
“These guys are getting better,” Robey said. “These guys are repping it out and going at it every day. Some guys make mistakes and get better from them, and some guys make mistakes and they get worse. It’s pretty much the coach’s call. Coach Lane Kiffin knows what to do.”
Assistant head coach Monte Kiffin said injuries have set back the secondary, but they expect a return to form in the near future.
“We just got some corners who have been banged up,” Monte Kiffin said. “We got some corners back, but they haven’t even played for a while.”
Both Monte Kiffin and Robey believe junior Torin Harris — who debuted against Syracuse after missing the opener against Hawai’i because of a hamstring injury he suffered in fall camp — will continue to improve and find his rhythm.
“He is getting better every day. We believe in him as a team. He’s been down with a couple of injuries, but he’s going to be better,” Robey said.
Last season, Harris started the first four games for USC and collected 17 tackles, a game-clinching interception against Minnesota and a forced fumble before a shoulder injury sidelined him for the rest of the season.
Still, Harris showed some signs of rust in his 2012 debut against Syracuse.
Against Syracuse, Harris was beaten for 67 yards and both passing touchdowns, while Seymour, despite showing promise as a four-star recruit from Pasadena, was flagged for two pass interference penalties.
With Syracuse relying on the pass and putting its better receivers in the slot, USC moved Robey into the nickel defensive back position, which left the more inexperienced corners on the outside.
Though the move allowed Syracuse to pick apart the secondary on the outside for 10.7 average yards per reception, Robey believed it gave the other corners some needed experience.
“Once they put me in the nickel, [Syracuse] started shooting outside,” Robey said. “But it did give the other guys a lot of reps and some playing time.”
Amid struggles in the secondary, Robey said it is his role to step up as a leader for the defensive backs.
“I got to come here and hold my side of the secondary down,” Robey said. “I just try to keep the mindset that I’m one of the key aspects of the secondary, so I got to look like it and lead like it.”
One idea was moving redshirt sophomore safety Josh Shaw to cornerback, but the coaches ruled out that possibility and will stick with the current cornerback corps.
“Hopefully our secondary gets back in the groove, because our corners need to play better,” Monte Kiffin said.
The secondary doesn’t have quite as stiff a contest this weekend because of Andrew Luck’s departure to the NFL, but Luck’s replacement, Josh Nunes, has proven efficient so far through two games, completing 32 of 56 passes for four touchdowns and one interception.
“We’re looking to get revenge. There’s a lot of motivation and a lot of emotion in this game,” Robey said. “I feel like we deserve this win more than they do, so we’re going to go out and get it.”

Basketball player Maurice Jones plans to transfer from USC, he announced via Twitter Wednesday morning.
“In a few hours I will be on my way home … I will be looking to transfer from USC smh,” Jones tweeted.
The news comes on the heels of Jones being ruled academically ineligible for the 2012-13 season. The original plan was for the 5-foot-7 guard to return to the team after sitting out this season.
“He’ll have two years [of eligibility] left,” head coach Kevin O’Neill told the Daily Trojan last week. “What we’re looking forward to is getting [Jones] back next year after Jio [Fontan] has graduated, and stepping right into the role of being the lead guard on our team.”
That no longer appears to be the case, although nothing is finalized in the transfer process. According to a USC spokesperson, no paperwork for a transfer had been filed as of Wednesday night. O’Neill reiterated to the Daily Trojan that he supports whatever decision Jones decides to make. He also stated he could not comment any further because Jones has not officially transferred yet.
Jones, a junior from Saginaw, MI, averaged a team-leading 13 points, 3.5 assists and 1.8 steals per game last season. He started all 32 of USC’s contests, averaging 38.2 minutes per game — good for the sixth-highest ranking in the NCAA. It remains to be seen where Jones might be interested in transferring, as he was unavailable for comment when reached by a number of publications.
ESPN Los Angeles reported Wednesday night that USC might seek to fill Jones’ scholarship with center Omar Oraby, a prospective 7-foot-2 transfer from Rice. As transfers between Division I schools must normally sit out one season, the NCAA would need to grant Oraby’s hardship waiver request for him to play immediately.

Fiona Apple
Friday, Sept. 14 at 7:30 p.m. · The Greek Theatre
A week after big-name music events like FYF and the MTV Movie Awards, Fiona Apple lands Downtown at the Greek Theatre.
Fans of Apple will realize this is her first album tour in six years, but even for those unfamiliar with the baroque pop/jazz artist, the concert should prove enjoyable. Apple plans to regale audiences with songs from her new album The Idler Wheel…, which features the new, chart-topping single “Every Single Night.”
In addition, Blake Mills, known for his subtle but memorable guitar stylings, will open for Apple before joining her backup band, which is sure to give the concert coherence.

Aziz Ansari
Thursday, Sept. 13-Friday, Sept. 14 at 7 p.m. · The Orpheum Theatre
Need a little laughter to celebrate the end of your first exam? Check out comedian Aziz Ansari at the Orpheum Theatre on Thursday night.
Though most will recognize him as the star of the show Parks & Recreation on NBC, Ansari has also made appearances in the film Funny People and the music video for “Otis” by Kanye West and Jay-Z.
Ansari’s current stand-up tour, Buried Alive, features all new material. If you’re in the mood for clean humor — foul language is unavoidable — Ansari typically keeps away from “race jokes,” preferring instead to make cracks about dating, his family and Hollywood life.
Tickets range from $25-45, but a few laughs to help you wind down are priceless.
 
‘Step Brothers’
Sunday, Sept. 16th 11 a.m.-6 p.m. · Gallery 1988, Venice
Do you incorporate quotes from the Will Ferrell comedy Step Brothers into everyday conversation? If so, get thee to Gallery 1988’s “Step Brothers” exhibit.
Gallery 1988, which specializes in geeky pop-culture art, has collected roughly 50 artists’ works dedicated to the film. While sketches of John C. Reilly won’t compare to the pieces by impressionist masters elsewhere in the city, the viewing experience should still be every bit as unforgettable.
The exhibit will stick around until Sept. 22, but you can already start thinking about where you’d most like to stamp a temporary “Step Brothers” tattoo. Those are promised to be on hand Sunday.

For most of art’s history, men ruled the form. Little by little, however, women started to enter the art world and prove their equality as artists.
Multiple media · An example of the unique art found at Fisher, April Wood’s “Feeding the Hunger #2” merges photography with sculpture. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
 
And now, it’s not uncommon to see female artists hosting their own solo shows and adding their own aesthetic styles to the contemporary art world.
With that in mind, USC Fisher Museum’s “A Complex Weave: Women and Identity in Contemporary Art” focuses on a diverse group of 16 female artists who bring their experiences with race, gender and culture to their respective media. Curated by Martin Rosenberg, an art history professor at Rutgers University, and J. Susan Isaacs, professor of art history at Towson University, the show breaks up these women’s works into five categories: Complex Geographies, Image and Text, Childhood and Family, The Body and Accessories and The Female Body.
These categories serve as the show’s main curatorial strength. Each category gets its own explanatory text, which includes quotes from the respective artists about their art. These signs help organize the show and touch on important themes to be found in the works. In addition, the quotes help viewers gets a quick sense of artists with whom they might not be familiar with.
The show naturally appeals to a female audience but does more than focus on just female issues — it also highlights the aesthetic contributions of the artists. Men and women alike will find something to appreciate here.
Lalla Essaydi’s works, for example, draw in the viewer with their impressive combination of visuals and writing. A striking photograph of an Asian woman and child in “Converging Territories #23” becomes even more visually engaging when the viewer notices the calligraphy on top of the image. Together, text and photograph create visual and thematic complexity.
In the Childhood and Family section, Judy Gelles’ piece “Self Portrait: She” also utilizes text to communicate an identity. The work features the outline of a woman with various phrases and adjectives such as “complex” and “likes to please others.” The near-transparent body behind the phrases suggests questions of how women’s actual identities get lost in these simple stereotypes.
One of the show’s most interactive pieces is Annet Couwenberg’s “Act Normal and that’s Already Crazy Enough.” The installation consists of seven frilly, pink cushions, each embroidered with one of the words of the title phrase. When the viewer first walks in, he or she walks around the cushions, which are set up in a circle.
Coincidentally, Couwenberg’s piece complements Sonya Clark’s “Curls,” a hanging group of black combs. The two women comment on image and societal behaviors by taking into consideration how a woman looks and how society thinks she should look. Curatorially, the strength of each work informs the other without taking away too much attention from surrounding pieces.
Other pieces also run the gamut of mediums and themes but still fit into a cohesive whole. As Rosenberg explains in the show’s pamphlet, “A Complex Weave” does not attempt to encompass all works by all women artists, nor does it narrow the works to fit one specific theme.
Each work stands on its own. But in the company of one another, the collection creates a true sense of the diversity of the female artist and the many issues she might face.
“A Complex Weave” includes an impressive assortment of pieces that appeal to the variety of aesthetic preferences visitors bring with them. Though the exhibit displays artwork that sometimes focuses on specifically feminine issues, the imaginations of the artists defy any gender classification.
 
“A Complex Weave” runs until Dec. 1, 2012. The USC Fisher Museum of Art is open Tuesday — Friday 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. For more information, visit fisher.usc.edu.

The Original Farmers Market at The Grove, a place that seems to perpetually up its swank factor, has done it again.
The latest addition to the complex’s impressive roster of retailers is Dylan’s Candy Bar, an impressive boutique-style candy store that puts your local Sweet Factory to shame.
World of pure imagination · Dylan’s Candy at The Grove features a wide assortment of treats, such as 2012 election chocolates and lollipops. – Marianne Zumberge | Daily Trojan
Founded by Dylan Lauren, daughter of fashion mogul Ralph Lauren, the first store opened in New York City in 2001, and has since grown into a chain with locations in the Hamptons, Houston, Miami and finally Los Angeles.
Those who possess a sweet tooth will drool over every aspect of this shop, starting with its glossy decor. If the gigantic plastic sculptures of lollipop trees, oversized candy buttons and melting chocolate bars don’t evoke images from the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory film, your childhood must have been a waste. Incidentally, according to the store’s website, a viewing of Willy Wonka at Dylan’s fifth birthday party sparked her goal to open her own candy store.
Today, the presentation of the candy alone lures customers in; everything has its place, in neat rows, columns and piles, color-coded even more expertly than an American Apparel store. Even the wrapping on each product is mouth-watering with vibrant but simple candy-inspired colors like cotton candy pink and Lemonhead yellow.
But even if it’s the shop’s aesthetic that will draw you in, the candy will keep you inside. Dylan’s offers an astoundingly wide selection of confections, ranging from the signature line of Belgian chocolate bars to retro favorites like Wax Lips and Pez. Dylan’s also carries boxed gift sets of mini chocolate bars and chocolate-drizzled snacks: pretzels, popcorn, gummy bears, fruit, nuts and more. Luckily, Dylan’s employees frequently roam around the store with trays of free samples, allowing patrons to taste that banana-cream-pie-flavored chocolate bar without having to commit to a curiosity purchase.
It’s not an exaggeration to say that every item for sale here is tempting to buy, whether for decadent flavors or pure novelty, but a few items stand out.
The bar of Bacon-Flavored Milk Chocolate cements Dylan’s Candy Bar’s cultural relevance with its participation in the bacon-flavored-everything fad. Another real standout is the Goo Goo Cluster Supreme, a reissue of the 1912 classic bar, which consists of caramel, pecans and marshmallow nougat surrounded by milk chocolate. Also impressive are the cookies ‘n’ cream-drizzled popcorn boxes, mega-sized candy buttons in classic flavors and a hilariously titled classic, the Squirrel Nut Zipper — a chewy caramel combined with chunks of peanuts.
Other highlights include themed display tables. The election-centered table boasts donkey-and-elephant-shaped lollipops, President Barack Obama action figures, tubs of red, white and blue jawbreakers and sugar cookies decorated with stars and stripes.
Another table features candies bizarrely modeled after savory foods — lollipops shaped like pickles, T-bone steaks, lobster claws and Thanksgiving turkeys come to mind. Also present here are bacon-flavored lollipops, chewing gum, gummy strips and dental floss, as well as roast beef-flavored breath mints and wasabi gumballs. A third table is filled with sweet confections for dogs. Any pampered L.A. pooch will love these pet-friendly frosted cookies, faux truffles, small cakes or even a Dylan’s-themed leash and collar set.
The products in this store look so tantalizing, you’ll wish you looked like them. And thankfully, you can — Dylan’s Candy Bar sells T-shirts, tank tops, tote bags, hats, jewelry, rain gear and even school supplies, all emblazoned with bold color schemes and the Dylan’s logo.
Entering Dylan’s Candy Bar is simply an extreme sensory experience. If you find yourself at The Grove, it’s definitely fun to at least pop your head in the door.
Unfortunately, though the sheer visual beauty of the shop makes it worth at least one visit, the exorbitant prices will surely keep the average college student (and sane person) from becoming a frequent customer.

The movies make it look so easy: Girl meets boy, girl and boy become friends, girl and boy begin hooking up, then girl and boy confess their love for each other.
As if life could ever be that simple. No matter what films like Friends with Benefits and No Strings Attached will try and sell you, the actual act of sleeping with a friend can get complicated.
I mean, how do you end things when one starts to lose interest? Or, most importantly, how do you even begin such a relationship?
After all, asking a person to take your friendship to the sheets isn’t necessarily simple. Unlike random hookups and one-night stands, you have to deal with rejection and thwarted feelings.
So before you take that next step, try and figure out why you even want a casual relationship. Sure, college is a time for exploring and living your life before you get tied down to a job, spouse, 401K and a dog named Skip. But not all people are built for such a relationship. Intuition can get foggy, feelings can get hurt — friends with benefits are not for the faint of heart.
If you’re down for the risk then there are loads of options out there for the Lothario/a seeking a friendly counterpart. Just make sure that you choose the option that best fits into your life and relationship, as there’s nothing worse than messing things up with a friend.
Some people go straight for the jugular and are able to ask their wannabe partners with a completely straight face if they’re down for a casual relationship.
Take the case of Subject A: Asked by an acquaintance if she wanted to be friends with benefits, Subject A agreed and the two enjoyed a rather fulfilling sexual relationship.
Subject A’s situation worked out in her favor, mostly because her sex buddy was someone she wasn’t necessarily best friends wit. Instead, he was someone with whom she enjoyed a friendly relationship.
You should definitely not ask a good friend out of the blue if they want to be purely sex buddies — it’s basically a slap in the face to the foundation of the actual friendship you two have built over time.
As Subject A said, “It was great while it lasted, because no one developed feelings or was hurt.” The plus was that her beau was a guy that she trusted, but didn’t have actual romantic feelings for, so the relationship was able to end on good terms.
Just make sure that intentions are clear: This is strictly a hookup situation. Try to keep things casual with such a partner. Don’t ask them out for coffee or dinner unless you actually have feelings for them. Try not to text them during daylight unless it’s a pertinent academic question.
If feelings begin to form, make sure you tell the other person as soon as possible. There’s nothing worse than offering yourself as a sacrifice to the god of heartbreak and false hope, so it’s better to rip off the Band-Aid and see what happens.
In the event that you find yourself off campus for a bit of worldly travel — and you find yourself a bit lonely — try to stay clear of any red light districts and instead find a friendly (and sexual) companion.
In Subject B’s case, traveling back home for the summer meant some fun in the sun with no strings attached. According to him, a hookup with a work colleague just happened one night, and the sexual relationship continued throughout the summer.
The word “relationship” was never spoken, probably because the two pretty much knew that  they weren’t in it for the long run. Sometimes a discussion never needs to happen for you two to be on the same page.
Subject B was a huge fan of the friends with benefits dynamic. “If you play your cards right [these relationships] can be a lot of fun,” he said.
Still, there have been instances of students falling in love abroad and somehow managing to continue the relationship, even with an ocean between them. Congratulations, sincerely. But it’s rare that such a miracle could happen, so it’s better to stick on the safe side and have a few months of fun instead of setting yourself up for heartbreak.
But when involved parties are actually decent friends, different rules apply. Chances are that the two have been fighting sexual chemistry for a while, and, thanks to a heavy chug of liquid courage, have finally sealed the deal.
This is where it gets risky. Even though you might want a casual hookup relationship with the friend, don’t tell him or her that right off the bat. There’s always the chance that the other person actually has feelings for you based on the friendship, and by shunning those feelings you’ll only hurt him or her.
Subject C was a freshman when she met her current boyfriend. The two weren’t ready to make things “official,” so they continued hooking up for seven months.
And though the two are happily together now, Subject C says that she was ready to be his girlfriend around four months in, and she made it known. But, according to her, “He was really ‘fratty’ about it and would say he still wasn’t ready. When he said that, it almost made me feel used.”
Eventually, Subject C’s beau got his act together and realized that he wanted to be with her. If you personally realize that you don’t want to date the person you are casually hooking up with, however, and he or she is obviously developing feelings, then put the kibosh on it immediately.
Apparently, the best relationships come from being friends first. And having a friend with benefits is one heck of a bridge to cross over to happily ever after.

A bittersweet high school reunion tale, Jamie Linden’s 10 Years amuses and charms viewers with a star-studded cast and multiple intertwining plotlines. Still, the film lacks in synchronicity and overall motivation.
High school sweethearts · Channing Tatum (left) and Rosario Dawson star in 10 Years, a film highlighting the awkward encounters of a high school reunion. The couple spends the night reminiscing about their glory days. – | Photo courtesy of Anchor Bay Films
Though the film devotes substantial time to the abundant subplots, the main story follows Jake (Channing Tatum) as he reunites with his high school buddies and old flame at his 10-year reunion, with his stunning girlfriend Jess (Jenna Dewan) in tow. Madly in love with Jess, Jake plans to propose but can’t seem to muster up the courage — an impediment that is further complicated when he reunites with his high school sweetheart Mary (Rosario Dawson) for the first time since graduating.
Tatum, adding yet another swoon-worthy leading role to his seemingly endless repertoire, succeeds as the sensitive yet manly Jake — a prototype that Tatum is well acquainted with. His love for real-life wife Dewan (cue the awws) is certainly reflected in their on-screen chemistry and, though neither character is particularly quirky or unique, they sure are nice to look at.
A flurry of Jake’s old high school friends and acquaintances, some of whom the film explores in abundant subplots, also join Jake, Jess and Mary at the reunion.
Cully (Chris Pratt), the former jock whose mission is to atone for his callous behavior in high school, creates a spectacle of drunken embarrassment — much to the horror of his fed up high school girlfriend and now-wife, Sam (Ari Graynor). While Pratt’s performance as the boorish Cully is spot-on, there is something tragic and depressing about his relationship with his wife, who gives off the vibe that she hates her life but knows nothing is ever going to change.
Then there is Marty (Justin Long) who seems to have continued right where he left off in high school — in futile pursuit of the stunning Anna (Lynn Collins), “miss popularity” in high school and still a knockout 10 years later. This plotline, however, also ends in a depressing twist when Anna’s seemingly glamourous and jovial life turns out to be nothing but a facade.
The most successful plotline occurs in an enchanting second-chance romance between band-geek-turned-rock-star Reeves (Oscar Isaac) and the quietly beautiful Elise (Kate Mara), who happens to be the only girl at the reunion not fawning over Reeves. The juxtaposition of his fame and heartthrob status with her total disregard for attention creates a beautiful chemistry between Isaac and Mara. The understated, subtle performances by both parties are exquisite — beyond that of Tatum and Dewan, even. Mara is flawless as Elise, with unmatched beauty and quiet fire. It’s a no-brainer that she would win the hearts of rock stars. Isaac, a rising star in young Hollywood, shines as the charming yet empty Reeves, bringing a coolness and charisma to the character along with a singing voice that wows the listener.
Though it does succumb to many clichés associated with any “reunion” film, 10 Years is, at its core, endearing and heartfelt. Despite a few moments of comic relief, most often resulting from Pratt’s drunken antics, the film barely qualifies as a comedy; in fact, the overall tone is unmistakably melancholy. All the comedy and moments of joy come from reflections the characters have on their glory days, but for the most part — with the exception of Jake and Jess — they seem a bit disappointed with the way their present lives have turned out.
The film’s success results from the subtle and meticulously crafted dynamics that inevitably arise among a group of grown adults seeing old friends for the first time in a decade. While Cully’s vulgarity and inebriated attempts at apologies become outlandish and painful to watch, the subtle flirtations between Reeves and Elise are cinematic gold. Similarly, while Marty’s desperate attempts to woo Anna play out as a hackneyed caricature, the moments that capture the look on Jess’ face as she holds a photo of Jake and Mary from back in the day are as heartbreaking as the simple moments and exchanges between Jake and Mary themselves.
Still, the relationship between the past sweethearts doesn’t match their depictions in the movie’s introduction, marketing or trailer. There is never any question of whether or not Jake’s feelings for Mary will resurface and he will consider leaving Jess for his ex-girlfriend. In fact, his love for Jess only seems to grow and intensify throughout the film, while Mary remains happily married. Rather than consider the possibility of reigniting an old flame, the two spend the evening catching up with one another, reflecting on the past but — more importantly — gushing about their present happiness. On this point, the movie generates little suspense.
Though the lack of conflict in Jake’s relationship with Jess initially seems safe and monotonous, there is a subtle yet delightful beauty in the ability of Jake and Mary to appreciate what they had while accepting that their relationship has become a thing of the past. Though many of the characters exude a blase attitude about their current affairs compared to their aspirations from high school, the relationship between Jake and Mary provides a redemptive alternative: exalting the simple joys in life over dreams of grandeur.
All in all, 10 Years  succeeds for what it is — a charming yet melancholy glimpse into a reunion of people whose lives might have not turned out to be all they imagined back in high school. Nothing more, nothing less.

According to a report released Sept. 7 by the General Education Faculty Committee, USC students often perceive the General Education program to be a “necessary evil.”
The current GE curriculum is fraught with issues, and the GE Faculty Committee has stepped up to the plate in an attempt to resolve these problems.
Unfortunately, the committee’s recommendations, from increasing the number of GE requirements to assigning students a separate GE grade point average, fail to properly and effectively improve the program.
There are numerous problems with USC’s current GE program. It imposes rigid requirements on students, including strict adherence to a 24-unit course load that cannot be taken at community college once a student arrives at USC. Many GE classes are far too large, often filling up an entire 150-person lecture hall. And the GE program, housed within the Dornsife School of Letters, Arts and Sciences, is largely isolated from the rest of the university.
Though the proposed reforms try to address this problem and others head-on, the committee’s recommendations not only fall short of fixing the real issues, they frustratingly create more complications.
For example, the committee recommends adding two more required GE classes on top of the six already in place. Requiring two more classes makes little sense and would just end up exacerbating the problems the program already faces. Students would have to spend more time completing their requirements, class sizes would remain large and the university would continue taking more money from students for classes in which they might express little interest.
Another committee recommendation calls for assigning a separate GPA for a student’s GE requirements. This would unnecessarily put at a disadvantage students who do not enjoy their GE classes and choose to focus on their major requirements rather than get a good grade in a GE course.
Perhaps the most useless proposal is to rename the GE program the “USC Literacies Program.” Such a superficial change would do nothing to actually improve the program.
If USC hopes students see the GE program as an engaging part of the curriculum rather than a burdensome set of classes that get in the way of “important” courses, the university must allow for more flexibility and better integration with USC’s professional schools.
The current inflexibility of the program unfairly forces most students to complete all their GE requirements at USC, taking away time they could devote toward other studies. Students are allowed to fulfill many of their GE requirements at a community college over a single summer — in between their high school graduation and the start of their freshman year — but most students are unaware of this rule until they enroll at USC. And once a student enrolls, the university prevents him or her from completing any GEs at a community college, except for the single diversity requirement.
A more flexible GE program should allow students to take more of their GE requirements at community colleges over the summer until they earn their degrees. Students who choose to take their GEs at USC would enjoy smaller classes, which would increase professors’ effectiveness and students’ engagement. Not to mention students would have more room in their schedules to explore secondary interests by picking up a minor or second major.
Additionally, the GE program would be most effective if it were better integrated with USC’s professional schools. Though the committee recommends allowing faculty from the professional schools to teach as a part of the GE program, this would only allow for liberal arts-related courses to be included in the GE curriculum. Through better integration with the wider academic breadth of the university, USC would ensure that all students, regardless of their majors, have exposure to more than liberal arts courses. For example, a chemical engineering major would be able to pursue her interest in economics, international relations and music under the GE umbrella.
The time has come for USC to revamp its GE program in order to make it truly amenable to students’ needs. While it’s encouraging that the university has taken proactive steps forward, much more action is needed to truly move the GE requirements in the right direction.
And that action is not just the university’s responsibility. In order for the program to be more in touch with students’ needs, students must make their needs heard. Students have until Oct. 1 to provide feedback about the committee’s recommendations on the GE review website: GE-Review.usc.edu/feedback.

With a million and one things swirling around in a student’s mind, upcoming ballot measures admittedly do not always make the cut. But they should. Especially one: Proposition 30.
Lener Jimenez | Daily Trojan
Prop. 30 is all about California education — it will not only prevent a possible $6 billion in cuts to public schools and colleges, but it will also provide billions of dollars in public funding that schools at all levels desperately need. The measure will do so by increasing the personal income tax of higher earning Californians by 1 to 3 percent for seven years. It will also up the state sales tax by 0.25 percent for the next four years.
Though USC, as a private university, and its students will not be directly affected by Prop. 30, what’s important is the principle at hand of supporting and improving our state education system. Private school students, faculty members and administrators are not separate from the problems in California public education. If USC students recognize that, we are uniquely positioned with not only the skills, but also the resources to launch a wave of awareness and action to propagate educational reform come election day on Nov. 6.
If Prop. 30 fails, the UC system will receive an immediate $250 million mid-year cut (translation: up to a $2,400 mid-year tuition increase for students), not to mention the loss of a $125 million tuition payback and a budget increase for the 2013-14 school year of $150 million. This comes out to a grand total of nearly $525 million, which means class cuts, spiking tuition rates, layoffs and innumerable students left with debt and without the high-quality education California owes them.
For the community college system, Prop. 30’s failure would result in a 7.5 percent budget cut. Thomas Fallo, president of El Camino College in Torrance, Calif. was quoted in his community college’s newspaper that class availability would be the first to go. Santa Monica College, a community college that many USC students transfer from, has already cut the entire winter session in response to funding cuts that were previously imposed. What will happen to SMC if Prop. 30 fails to pass in November?
Admittedly, it’s not a private university’s responsibility to fix the public school system. But are we really immune to these catastrophic changes just because we’re lucky enough to attend a private university? What about those of us who transferred from a UC school or used a state community college as a stepping stone to get to USC? What about the countless personal and academic connections between public and private colleges of which we are a part?
Students have to take a stand for these connections and for education by supporting Prop. 30.
Not to mention, Prop. 30 also impacts all students, whether public or private, by guaranteeing local public safety funding. Part of this funding keeps police on the streets to protect us, something USC students should especially appreciate. Prop. 30 also helps to balance the state budget, providing money that would ease the current debt crisis.
Unfortunately, according to a Policy Analysis for California Education and USC Rossier School of Education poll released in August, only 55 percent of voting Californians —  a slim majority over the 50 percent needed to pass the measure —  are in favor of the proposition. The poll also found that 36 percent strongly oppose Prop. 30, and 49 percent agree with the argument against it —  that the state should crack down on government spending before it raises taxes.
A group of students from the Claremont Colleges —  all private institutions —  launched a campaign in August called “Claremont College Students for Proposition 30,” complete with a Facebook page, info sessions, phone banking and more. They recognize that Prop. 30 needs everyone’s support, whether they’re a member of the public education system or not.
USC portrays itself and its students as trendsetting, as compassionate and committed to education. Let’s keep that image a reality by creating our own campaign — whether it’s a personal or group effort —  for Prop. 30.
 
Elena Kadvany is a senior majoring in Spanish. Her column “Beyond the Classroom” runs every other Thursday.
I can hardly agree with the comenters here that pretend they are smart. The less fortunate people need help. There may be bright individuals among them that were simply unfortunate to be borne in poor or dismembered families. Are you guys serious when you are saying you want to cut the money so they cannot go to school ? How moronic can that be. Of course the state is not entitled to touch the rich people riches. But how they will continue making their bucks without caring for the young generation by whose work they will be even richer, or maybe they’ll go to India and China to hire, right ? This is arrogance, and indecency. This is imbecilism and not wisdom on your site. I don’t care whose song you are dancing by, but for sure your behaviour is anti-American.
The governor has been astute in his cuts.
There indeed will be dire consequence if prop 30 fails. I will support it.
Elaina,
I think it would be a dandy idea if you”d hold off telling us how to waste our money on more state and less individual until you’re earning your own keep.
Fight On,
JLH
Jax, 
I think it would be a dandy idea if you weren’t a flaming a s s hole who qualifies the comments of others. “Elena” is spot on with her observations and deductions. You and your ignorant ilk (Liberty Minded, WCW, John ’94) on this page are clutching at straws. If you hate California so much do us all a favor and vacate. The state will be greatly improved by your absence.
Hypocrite, talk about qualifying others remarks, and NO, i’m tired of idiot liberals who have controlled this states budget, no more wasting our tax dollars,” but our public schools will suffer ”
AT almost dead last in reading and math i have to say our schools are suffering pretty bad, why the hell should we put out more money for a complete and utter failure, CABBAGE, you need to crawl back under that rock, moron.
Actually, the overall tax rate (combined property, transportation, income, etc) has gone down.  Funding for education has gone down, and, of course, the miracle that made California a leader in education has been crumbling.  Because of this underfunding, millions of kids are shut out of education, a human right that society should provide to all who desire it.  
This simple truth is that we need to fund education as an investment.  The public good that educated citizens provide is of very high value, and a very good bargain for the small increase in taxes represented by Prop 30.  
Privileged children of wealthy parents probably find it hard to understand, but many in this society need a hand up, not a hand out.  With a little education, they will spend the rest of their lives contributing to society.
Every dollar spent on education will return many times more in dividends. Thank you for your thoughful letter.
Which state currently has the 2nd highest marginal tax rate in the nation?  California top rate is 10.3%, second only to Hawaii at 11%.
California’s second-to-top tax rate, 9.3%, is higher than the HIGHEST rate in 47 other states.  The 9.3% rate starts at just $48,000 in taxable income.
California’s state sales tax is already the nation’s highest.
Yet, despite that our taxes are ALREADY among the nation’s highest, the California Legislature would like you to believe that we can only balance our budget by passing a $40-50 BILLION multi-year tax hike.
If Proposition 30 passes, California will have the nation’s 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th highest marginal tax rates AND the nation’s highest state sales tax.
California has low rating for business climate and tax climate, due to our high taxes, our high costs, and our ineffectual state government.  Do you think Proposition 30 will help or hurt California’s ailing economy?  We currently have the 3rd worst unemployment rate in the nation.
Proposition 30 does NOTHING to address California’s STRUCTURAL budget deficit.  It’s the WRONG MEDICINE to fix what ails California.  VOTE NO ON PROPOSITION 30.
Google search “California Proposition 30: Governor Jerry Brown’s Big-Government Tax Hike” for more information on the many flaws of Proposition 30.
No on 30.  This is billed as a tax on the “rich” who Governor Brown says are “millionaires and billionairs” but defines as anyone making over $250k.  There have been numerous studies and reports cited that most if not all of the revenue will NOT be used for schools, but for teacher pensions.  Just use Google, you will find them.
What is not talked about is how it also includes a sales tax increase on EVERYONE.  California already has the highest if not close to the higest sales tax.
The problem with California is it has a spending problem, not a revenue problem.  This is just another cycle in the never-ending cycle where the Legislature spends WAAAAAYYY more than it takes in, then comes to the voters with hat in hand saying please give us more money or we are going to cut funding to schools, police, fire, etc.  The Legislature needs to do what we all have to do, LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS.  Don’t succomb to the “but it’s for the children” mantra.  It’s not.
There are a hundred places they could cut benefits, but the far left would rather create a false dichotomy, i.e. Our ONLY options are to raise taxes on the EVIL FILTHY RICH (also known as “the best and brightest”) or cut money from schools. Really? We can’t find cuts anywhere else? Gee, I dunno, maybe they could cut entitlement benefits for public unions or decrease welfare handouts or limit TV time for prisons or stop spending money educating children from other countries (who do NOT return the favor in the reverse situation) while American taxpayers watch American children fall further and further behind. 
What a crock of crap … eventually we’re going to run out of other people’s money.
Yes, Students should vote to raise taxes on themselves and others because anything that shrinks the governments’ taxing spending ability would jeopardize our march to absolute state control over our lives and the lives of our fellow residents.
The bigger the government the smaller the citizen. Our state can make every promise in the world, but in the end you personally must pay. The question remains – can you spend your money better or can the state employees spend your money better? No state employee works for free. Every state employee thinks they are overworked and deserve a raise. Will you give it to them?

University Gateway Apartments, a popular off-campus housing choice for undergraduate students, recently opened up a sober floor, whose residents are encouraged to battle addiction and pursue a degree in a helpful and welcoming environment. The floor, known as “The Haven,” is the first of its kind in the USC community – meaning that the university itself hasn’t instituted a sober floor yet. This oversight on USC’s part is inexcusable.
USC prides itself on its stellar academics and athletic performance, as well as its commitment to creating a safe environment for students. While there is no shortage of academic and extracurricular offerings, however, the university does little to encourage battling addiction to harmful drugs.
On campus, there are countless advertisements for student government, Greek life and academic opportunities, but I have yet to see a flyer for a public forum for students battling addiction. DPS does an exemplary job of monitoring substances on campus, but there are still instances of students abusing drugs and alcohol and continuing to do so without a support system.
USC has a multitude of community floors in its housing system, and in the case of the honors program at Birnkrant Residential College, even community dorms. What’s stopping them from opening up a sober floor in a dorm or one of their off-campus apartment buildings?
The problem is that the connotation of being attached to the “addict” floor is negative. The brave ones who can call themselves addicts and who are willing to work hard on recovering are few and far between, and that may not be enough to warrant a specialized community in the university’s view.
In order to make developing its own sober special interest community worthwhile, the university must first raise awareness and remove misconceptions about what being an addict is. After raising awareness about sobriety and addiction, as we do for the sports and academics we are known for, then USC will have the interest it needs to open a sober floor and foster a caring environment for students suffering from addiction.
How about just promoting responsible drinking throughout campus, instead of alcoholics in training on campus, most especially the Row?

Even those who aren’t gluten-free have a pretty decent idea of where the hidden protein can be found. You know: Pasta, bread — that sort of thing.
But there are plenty of foods that must be dismissed from your diet that you never even thought would be gluten-central.
If you were healthy beforehand, then ten points for Gryffindor. But if you were like me, and enjoyed your fast food and fried food on the regular, then coming up with a substitute for your mother’s fried chicken is no easy feat.
There’s always the option of frying your meat in corn or rice flour — but it doesn’t exactly have the same feel as classic fried chicken.
It may sound strange, but covering your chicken in cornflakes actually works. It has the crunch, a bit of flavor, and without all the extra unhealthy calories.
For fast food lovers: Five Guys’ menu is almost entirely gluten-free — save the buns. If you’re upset that you can’t get a burger from there, then just double up on their delicious Cajun fries. It’ll ease the pain.
Wendy’s also has a lot of gluten-free options on their menu, unlike my old favorite McDonald’s. Check out Wendy’s gluten-free menu online.

Men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill and his staff bolstered their 2013 recruiting class on Monday with the commitment of 6’10 big man Nikola Jovanovic, according to the Orange County Register. Before joining the Trojans, the Serbian native will polish his game this season playing at Arlington Country Day School in Jacksonville, Fla.
Jovanovic can bring to the Trojans his wide array of post moves and a shooting touch vaguely reminiscent of Orlando Magic player and former Trojan star Nikola Vucevic, also an international recruit.
Earlier this summer, O’Neill scored commitments from two guards—Kahlil Dukes (Hartford, Conn.) and Roschon Prince (Long Beach, Calif.). Both will add depth to a Trojan squad that, at one point in time last season, employed multiple walk-ons in the regular rotation. Rounding out the Class of 2013 is USC’s top ranked player of this year’s recruiting haul, point guard Kendal Harris (Richardson, Texas). Harris is the only member of the class who is ranked in ESPN’s top 100 (#74, #18 PG). He will have the opportunity to compete for playing time in the backcourt with returning guards Jio Fontan and J.T. Terrell along with a possibly reinstated Maurice Jones.
The four newcomers combine to give USC one of its larger incoming recruiting classes, as the Trojans during O’Neill’s tenure have relied primarily on transfers for new blood within the program.
The Trojans open up their regular season in less than two months against Coppin State at the Galen Center.
