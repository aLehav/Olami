Over the past six seasons, one idea has been ingrained in many college football fans’ minds: the South Eastern Conference is far and away the best national conference. To be honest, if one were to take a cursory glance, it would not seem like much of a stretch. The past six national champions have all come from that league: LSU, Auburn, Florida (twice) and Alabama (twice).
Don’t look now though, SEC. Someone’s gaining on you. The West Coast powerhouses are quickly biting at your tail. It might be hard to believe, but the Pac-12 Conference is catching up to the SEC, and it might in fact supersede it by 2012. True, the last national champion from the conference was USC in 2004, but take a look at last year’s teams and compare them to the SEC’s. They are eerily similar.
At the top of the SEC, Alabama and LSU collided to provide perhaps the most boring national championship in the history of collegiate athletics. Behind them, Arkansas had a great season, finishing 11-2 and fifth in the Associated Press poll, followed by 11-2 South Carolina and 10-4 Georgia. In the final poll, the SEC had five teams in the top 25 — a solid showing, to say the least.
Not far behind, however, was the Pac-12. Oregon finished fourth, USC finished sixth and Stanford finished seventh, each team only losing two games. That is three teams in the top 10 — the same number as the SEC. True, the SEC had two more teams in the final poll later, but the SEC also had some bad teams at the bottom of the conference: Four teams in the conference finished under .500, including 2-10 Ole Miss. The Pac-12, meanwhile, had just five teams under .500, one being 6-8 UCLA, which played in the conference title game — albeit by default.
Perhaps you still aren’t convinced. Well, let’s take a look at next year’s projections.
USC, with the return of junior quarterback Matt Barkley and 17 of 22 starters, is thought by most pundits to be one of the top two teams in the country, with many placing them firmly as a preseason No. 1.
Oregon, despite losing its starting backfield, is still projected to be a top five team.
Stanford, despite losing star quarterback Andrew Luck, is still likely to be a preseason top 15 team, whether deservedly or not.
Washington has one of the most explosive offenses in the country, and although they might not start in the top 25, it will likely make its way up the rankings, improving its 7-6 record.
Cal just had one of its most impressive recruiting classes, and although some of its players have slowly begun to decommit, the players who stay, as well as the returning starters, could have Cal winning eight games — possibly more.
In the SEC — outside LSU, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia and South Carolina — no team is really expected to make much noise on the national stage. The SEC is supposedly heavier at the top, but the Pac-12 is right there. And from top to bottom? The Pac-12 is better.
Don’t forget the individual star power of the Pac-12, either. There’s Barkley, junior redshirt tailback Curtis McNeal, sophomore receiver Robert Woods, freshman receiver Marqise Lee, junior safety T.J. McDonald, sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey, and many others. That’s only USC.
Around the conference, Oregon backs Kenjon Barner and De’Anthony Thomas are expected to have big seasons.
Quarterback Keith Price from Washington accounted for seven touchdowns in the team’s bowl game.
Arizona State runningback Cameron Marshall is back in Tempe, and he had 18 rushing touchdowns in 2011.
Keenan Allen from Cal returns and finished last season with the ninth most receiving yards in the country.
Receiver Marquess Wilson from Washington State is back as well. Defensively, eight non-USC players from the All-Conference team are playing in 2012, including defensive back John Boyett from Oregon and linebacker Chase Thomas from Stanford.
The SEC has ruled college football for a while now, but in terms of teams and players, the Pac-12 is as good, if not better. And by the time the 2012 season ends, mark my words: Pundits won’t be talking about the SEC anymore — all the chatter will be about the Pac-12.

Following a narrow overtime loss on Sunday, the USC women’s basketball team is looking to rebound with a visit to Boulder, Colo., where they will take on the Buffaloes.
Fast start · Beginning the season ranked No. 23 in the AP poll, USC has opened Pac-12 play with five wins through seven games. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Although the 65-61 loss to Oregon State snapped the Women of Troy’s five-game winning streak and left them 2-2 at home in conference play, the Women of Troy (10-7, 5-2) remain 3-0 on the road against Pac-12 opponents.
On the other hand, Colorado (14-4, 3-4) has yet to win a home game against a conference opponent. It began the season with 12 straight wins, but has gone just 3-4 over the course of Pac-12 play.
The game against the Buffaloes will be USC’s first of a two-game road swing, ending with a visit to Salt Lake City to face Utah (9-9, 2-5) on Saturday.
“When we get out on the road, we get together as a team,” USC coach Michael Cooper said. “We get into our game plan, we know what we’re supposed to do and it’s us against the world.”
The team’s three Pac-12 road wins came against Arizona State, Arizona and UCLA during USC’s season-high five-game win streak, which was ruined by Oregon State’s late push in overtime at the Galen Center.
“It was a tough loss. We shouldn’t have lost that game and we know that,” USC junior forward Christina Marinacci said. “Now we just have to get it back, take each game one at a time and move forward.”
The Women of Troy will get that chance to recover against a team led by versatile guard Chucky Jeffery. She leads the Buffaloes in points, rebounds and assists. She shoots 40 percent from behind the arc.
Despite Jeffery’s impressive play, Cooper had a simple strategy to dispel her effectiveness.
“Put Briana Gilbreath on her,” Cooper said. “She’s our team’s leader on defense.”
Senior guard Gilbreath, who was a rebound shy of a triple-double in USC’s 92-73 win over Oregon last week, is No. 8 all-time in steals and No. 5 all-time in blocks. She scored eight points and pulled down nine rebounds against the Beavers.
While Gilbreath has headed the team’s defensive efforts, senior guard Ashley Corral has stepped it up on the other end of the court.
Along with being No. 4 all-time in assists, Corral has scored 20 or more points in three conference games so far, including her 20-point effort against Oregon State on Sunday.
The last time Colorado and USC met, Corral dropped seven out of eight 3-pointers en route to a career-high 32 points, giving the Women of Troy an 87-70 win over the Buffaloes in the NIT quarterfinals last March.
This is Colorado’s first season in the Pac-12 after previously competing in the Big-12 conference.
Marinacci and sophomore forward Cassie Harberts have also maintained a well-rounded presence on the floor, combining for 22.4 points and 13.6 rebounds in Pac-12 conference play.
After losing to Oregon State, USC stands at third in the Pac-12 behind No. 1 Stanford (17-1, 8-0) and California (15-5, 6-2). The Golden Bears, however, will be facing the Cardinal on Saturday, which could give the Women of Troy a chance to rise in the standings with a win against the Utes on the same day.
Nevertheless, Cooper insists that the team cannot be distracted by the conference leaders’ clash up in Palo Alto.
“We’ve got to take care of our own business,” Cooper said. “We’re going to go to Colorado, get that win [and] then we’re going to go to Utah and get that one. Then we’ll look at the standings and see where we sit.”
The Women of Troy are currently sitting in third place in the conference, while Stanford, at 8-0, remains in first place, followed closely by California at 6-2. The Women of Troy will take on Colorado at 6 p.m.

USC Libraries received a $5-million donation from USC trustee Ronald Sugar and his wife to endow the Valerie and Ronald Sugar Dean’s Chair of the USC Libraries, the university announced Wednesday.
Novel donation · USC Libraries, which consists of 23 buildings, launched a cloud-computing consultation service and an online librarianship master’s degree program. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The endowment will be used to acquire new literary collections, expand the libraries’ digital archives and the creation of the Dean’s Challenge Grant, which will help fund pilot programs and encourage innovation and creativity.
Catherine Quinlan, the dean of USC Libraries, will be installed as the first Valerie and Ronald Sugar Dean’s Chair of USC Libraries.
President C. L. Nikias said the donation, the first to endow a chair in USC Libraries history and the largest endowment of a dean’s chair in USC history, will help support USC’s core academic mission.
“The USC Libraries are of central importance to the university’s academic mission,” Nikias told USC News. “This historic endowment gift ensures that the USC Libraries will continue to lead the nation — especially in the building of innovative digital collections and resources.”
Quinlan said the expanded digital and research collections will help USC’s rise as a leading research institution.
“World-class library faculty, staff and research collections are vital contributors to USC’s continuing rise on the global stage,” Quinlan said. “The Sugars’ generosity will help ensure that our libraries are able to support our talented students and transformative faculty at USC. The impact of this gift will be significant, enduring and broadly felt at USC and beyond.”
Ronald Sugar, who earned his doctorate in engineering at UCLA in 1971 and is the former chairman and CEO of Northrop Grumman Corp., an aerospace and defence contracting company. He currently chairs the Academic Affairs Committee of the USC Board of Trustees and holds the Judge Widney Professorship in Management and Technology. He also serves on the boards of Apple, Air Lease Corp., Chevron and Amgen.
Valerie Sugar graduated from USC with a master’s degree in library sciences and has served on the USC Libraries’ Board of Directors, helping raise awareness of the libraries’ special collections.
USC Libraries consists of 23 libraries and information centers. USC Libraries also launched USC Digital Repository, which offers cloud-computing consultation service, last year. This year, USC Libraries is working to develop an online librarianship master’s degree program, according to USC News.
“Great libraries fuel the work that takes place at great research universities,” Valerie Sugar said. “Through our gift, we hope the USC Libraries continue to support a vibrant community of critical thinkers, seekers of knowledge and engaged world citizens for many generations to come.”
 
[Correction: A previous version of this article stated that USC Libraries launched an online master’s degree in librarianship. The program is currently in development.]

Maybe  it’ll happen on Thursday, maybe it won’t.
With the USC men’s basketball team’s last win coming more than a month ago on Dec. 19 against Texas Christian, the Trojans are still searching for their first win in Pac-12 play. The team’s current eight-game losing streak is also the program’s longest since the 1988-1989 season when it dropped 13 in a row.
USC coach Kevin O’Neill hopes his struggling team can reverse its course at last, as it hosts Colorado at the Galen Center.
“We’ve got 11 games left and we’ve got to look at every one as an opportunity to get a win,” O’Neill said. “We’re going to play with who we’ve got and move ahead in a positive manner. That’s all we can do.”
Little rest · Sophomore guard Maurice Jones, pictured at home during a game against Oregon last year, is averaging more than 38 minutes per game this season. Jones is one of just seven scholarship players who are healthy enough to play for the Trojans. - Daily Trojan file photo
The Trojans (15-5, 0-7) don’t have a whole lot. With junior forward Aaron Fuller out for the remainder of the season because of a torn labrum in his left shoulder, just seven scholarship players are available.
Senior guard Jio Fontan (knee), redshirt sophomore forward Evan Smith (shoulder) and sophomore center Curtis Washington (shoulder) have all been sidelined with season-ending injuries in addition to Fuller, who had been leading the team in rebounding with 5.9 per contest.
“We always talk about one thing: Do your job,” O’Neill said. “I’m getting paid; you’re getting a scholarship. Our job is to go out and do the best we can with what we’ve got. And that’s what our guys have been trying to do.”
With fewer and fewer lineup options remaining, O’Neill opted to start walk-on junior guard Daniel Munoz in their last game at Oregon State. The 5-foot-10 Munoz had played in just four games all season before being placed into the starting lineup against the Beavers.
Munoz is among two walk-ons this season who have received playing time, the other being senior guard Eric Strangis, who started during the team’s season opener against Cal State Northridge.
Munoz is not expected to start Thursday but will play a key role off the bench, which will allow sophomore guard Maurice Jones to slide over to play shooting guard — his natural position according to O’Neill.
In spite of the dwindling numbers, things do not appear to be getting any easier for USC — at least not come Thursday.
Colorado (13-6, 5-2) has won eight of its last 10 games, including two consecutive wins over Arizona and Arizona State. The Buffaloes also start three seniors and have four players averaging in double figures in points in guard Carlon Brown (13.4), forward Andre Roberson (10.9), forward Austin Dufault (11.6) and guard Spencer Dinwiddie (10.8).
“We know they’re good,” O’Neill said. “We’ll have to play great to win.”
If there is any consolation it might be that Colorado is just 1-4 in road games this season, and of USC’s five wins this season, three have come within the friendly confines of the Galen Center.
But offensive difficulties continue to haunt O’Neill’s young squad, as it still ranks last in the conference in nearly every statistical category: points per game, field goal percentage and assists per game, among others.
“It’s real frustrating,” said freshman guard Byron Wesley, who is shooting just 38 percent from the field through 20 games this season. “Our shots just haven’t been falling. We have to keep playing hard, keep playing defense and eventually these shots are going to fall.”
Wesley, who scored 15 points against Oregon State on 7-of-10 shooting, remains optimistic that the young unit’s offensive struggles will be alleviated sooner rather than later.
“The key was staying focused,” Wesley said of his recent outburst. “I’ve been getting good shots in some of these games and I just haven’t been making them. So last game I was focused on making shots and not just getting them up.”
And though the Trojans have won just one game over the last two months, O’Neill insists it hasn’t been because of any sort of lack of effort.
“These guys go hard,” O’Neill said. “They give us what they got. They give great effort. I couldn’t be happier with their effort. They just haven’t been rewarded with wins.”
Tip-off is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The game will not be televised but will be broadcasted exclusively on USCTrojans.com.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety daily incident log between Tuesday, Jan. 24, and Wednesday, Jan. 25.
Crimes against a person
at 9:46 p.m. on Jan. 24, a student in the USC School of Cinematic Arts said he was pushed by his professor after he entered a darkened classroom while a movie was playing and bumped into the professor.
Crimes against property
at 12:37 a.m. on Jan. 25, DPS officers responded to a report of three suspects vandalizing vehicles near 3427 Catalina St. and detained three students for investigation. The students were intoxicated and, during questioning, said they had been kicking vehicles. The owner of one of the vehicles said the side view mirror was damaged, but he did not desire criminal prosecution. The students were told the matter would be referred to Student Judicial Affairs and was released.
at 7:43 p.m. on Jan. 24, a suspect smashed the rear passenger side window of a car parked on 28th Street and Hoover Street to gain entry and stole a bracelet, an emergency kit and a pair of jumper cables.
at 9:29 a.m. on Jan. 24, the luggage compartments and possibly the undercarriage were damaged when a staff member drove a university tram outside of the USC area over a raised portion of pavement while transporting passengers up a hill to a cabin in Malibu.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 5:43 p.m. on Jan. 24, DPS officers responded to a fourth-floor fire alarm that was activated at the Ronald Tutor Hall of Engineering when a student accidentally bumped into a pull station. No smoke or fire was found. FMS personnel responded to reset the alarm and officers cleared the building for re-entry. LAFD was not requested.
at 3:10 p.m. on Jan. 24, DPS officers responded to a non-USC male who was found unresponsive in an examination room in Healthcare Consultation Center. A Rapid Response team was at the scene treating the male when officers arrived and the man was subsequently transported to Keck Hospital of USC for additional medical treatment.
at 1:52 p.m. on Jan. 24, a student in Taper Hall said a male subject, who she recently met at a social gathering, has shown up at a market where she was shopping and in one of her classes on campus, which has caused her to fear for her safety. DPS officers advised the student to contact them if she encounters the subject again.
Can someone explain why the USC tram was four-wheeling in Malibu?  No wonder the tram is always running late.

The Undergraduate Student Government held a forum Wednesday for Lyon Center administrators to field student concerns ranging from problems with broken equipment to a shortage of space for outdoor soccer teams.
Work it out · Lyon Center administrators address questions and concerns of students at a forum moderated by Mikey Geragos (far right), Undergraduate Student Government’s director of University Affairs. - Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
Mike Kohl, the president of the Recreational Club Council, Justine Gilman, senior associate director of recreational sports at the Lyon Center and Sara Shin, coordinator of intramural sports, comprised the panel.
Lyon Center representatives also informed students of the scope of the recent renovations to the gym. Gilman said the university spent more than $2 million replacing lockers, lights and repainting the main gym over winter break.
Gilman said these repairs were possible because of the cooperation of university administration, but stressed the importance of voicing concerns to the administration.
“Both our president and provost are aware that recreation is a priority and the more they hear from the students that is a priority, the more it will be a priority,” Gilman said.
USG representatives who put on the event said they realized the importance of making student concerns heard.
“The forum is a great way for students to voice concerns to the administration of the Lyon Center directly,” USG President Monish Tyagi said. “We’ve seen forums be very successful on different issues in the past.”
Students in the audience also said it was helpful to have a direct conversation with administrators. Some said they were not aware of the efforts to renovate the Lyon Center.
“I was impressed with their efforts to fix their facilities,” USG Senator Pro Tempore Vinnie Prasad said. “It gave us an insight into what goes on behind the scenes at the Lyon Center and intramural sports.”
Several students hoped the forum would help the administration see the Lyon Center from a student’s point of view.
Issues such as replacing the handholds on the rock climbing wall in the back of the gym and adding more intramural fields were discussed.
“Constantly working equipment is my biggest concern,” said Ashley Smith, a sophomore majoring in communication. “But I would like to see higher sustainability, like spigot water fountains, for filling water bottles too.”
The discussion mostly addressed issues of crowding and equipment.
“The Lyon Center needs more bench presses so it is less crowded in the weight rooms,” said Ayinde Armour, a senior majoring in electrical engineering.
Amy Rasplicka, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said she has noticed broken equipment can lead to overcrowding.
“If they just got all the broken machines fixed, not even just the TVs but the actual machines, I think things would be a lot better,” Rasplicka said.
Gilman and the other administrators were hopeful they could resolve students’ issues.
“We have over 3,000 people that use the Lyon Center a day, so we have a lot of users, but we have a full time staff that is available to listen to people with issues,” Gilman said.

I often hear from non-comic book readers that they don’t read comics not out of a lack of interest, but out of intimidation over where to begin.
This complaint isn’t completely unwarranted.
Narrative arcs within various series can be complex and many people don’t want to just jump into the middle of a story. After all, there are more than 650 issues of the Amazing Spider-Man, and even to the well-versed reader, the X-Men storyline’s continuity is jokingly described as a mess.
Even if there is a comic that someone wants to read, the fear of having to read the back issues might be overwhelming.
Comic book companies have attempted to address these concerns to attract new readers, but new readership accessibility comes as a catch-22. Every year the “Big Two” — DC and Marvel — launch brand-new series. The problem, however, is that these are almost always tied to that year’s big crossover storyline.
Marvel’s Siege miniseries was a culmination of half a decade of stories, and it led to a series of books under the “Heroic Age” banner, almost all of which play out of events from Siege that new readers might not be familiar with.
Similarly, even after — spoiler alert — DC Comics “killed off” Bruce Wayne after Final Crisis, the new group of comics all continued in the contextual aftermath of that series and Grant Morrison’s Batman RIP storyline. In that sense, it seems as if almost every new series needs some basic understanding of what has come before.
This is really a problem that only applies to comics set within a long, continuous plotline; these are series that have been going on for years and are designed to keep going.
On the other hand, series such as Vertigo titles DMZ or more independent ones such as Scott Pilgrim have fixed endpoints. They’re meant to be read from the start; that’s really the only jumping-on point.
The issue is that as a creative industry, comic book companies want to show growth and progression of characters and stories. Episodic procedurals don’t really appeal to most dedicated readers, so stories instead build on one another, characters, age and mythos and continuity develop.
It’s a lot like watching Lost. For those following along, it’s great. For those who aren’t, it’s a pain.
It’s not as if comic book companies don’t try to draw in new readers. Superhero movies and other films based on comic books, such as Sin City or Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, come out every year. And every year, comic industries re-release the comics or put out new storylines and series to draw in moviegoers. Sometimes they work, but in many cases the series are still marred by a wall of the overwhelming undertaking of large series.
At the turn of the century, Marvel launched its Ultimate line, taking iconic characters such as Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four and giving them fresh starts, disregarding previous storylines.
These were reinvented for the new millennium and unencumbered by past stories. These series, however, soon built up their own continuity, making it increasingly more difficult for new readers to pick up in the middle of any given series.
DC Comics tried a big gamble to pick up new readers last year by launching its “New 52.” It was a complete re-launch of its line, with every series starting with a new number one and new storylines to get readers engaged.
Some of these work. Scott Snyder’s Batman is very open to the uninitiated, but Green Lantern still plays on the story elements from the last few years. Still, it showed a full commitment to getting more people into comics.
Comic books unfortunately have a very limited reader base. But with the popularity of superhero movies, blockbusters and a resurgence of the horror genre, comics are more sought after than ever. And with the digital world making them easily available, there needs to be more effort from the companies to clearly offer opportunities for new readers to jump on. This doesn’t have to come at the expense of continuity or story; comics just need to stop being so insular.

That’s why my favorite comic is Kingdom Come and stuff like it because I got into it knowing just the basics about the heroes. Then I learned more about them, came back and read it again, it got even better!
Actually, “continuity” wasn’t much of a problem until they tried to “correct” it in 1984 with Crisis on Infinite Earths.
Up ’till then, both Marvel & DC had histories, but they were easy to follow, even with 45 years of backstories.
Marvel had one long history tying their Golden Age material to the Silver Age to the Bronze Age with little problem except minor updating like moving Reed Richards and Ben Grimm’s wartime experience from World War II to Korea.
DC had two histories.
Golden Age tales took place on Earth-2.
SIlver Age and Bronze Age stories were on Earth-1.
The only problems were explaining how, even though there were totally-different Flashes, Hawkmen, Green Lanterns, etc, Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman were basically the same in both universes.
But even that was handled by having the Golden Age versions marry and retire, leaving their successors like Robin, Huntress, and Power Girl to replace them.
After DC’s attempt in 1984 to merge everything into one universe, nothing has gone right.
There have been almost constant reboots and revamps every couple of years with varying degrees of success.
(Try explaining the history of Hawkman, the poster child for f@#$ed-up continuity!)
Marvel, on the other hand, after decades of one coherent universe, went the opposite route and now has multiple continuities…and can’t keep track of which histories apply to which universe, and has gone the route of either retelling the first couple of years of Silver Age stories over and over again with minor tweaking, or doing “What-If” maxi-series (What if the Marvel Universe began in 1602?).
Don’t blame the game.
Blame the players.

Welcome Inn Time Machine
Welcome Inn at Eagle Rock
Sunday, Jan. 29, 4 p.m. — 10 p.m.
Crank up the weird this weekend with Welcome Inn Time Machine, an interactive experimental art installation. It takes place not in a gallery or a museum, but in a motel in Eagle Rock called the Welcome Inn, which converts its rooms into a treasure trove of quirky, diverse “mini concerts.”  Put on by the Society for the Activation of Social Space Through Art and Soundcalls — try saying that five times fast — the exhibition looks to be a fascinating examination of local experimental art.
The concerts, which take place in individual rooms, feature Southern California-based experimental music from various historical periods. The format allows visitors to visit significant musical moments in time in chronological order and features everything from dissonant violin experiments to recreations of revolutionary free-jazz artist Ornette Coleman’s work.
As if the awesomely bizarre musical experiments weren’t enough, Welcome Inn Time Machine offers free admission — an impressive deal, considering the scope of the event.
 
Museums Free-For-All
Saturday, Jan. 28- Sunday, Jan. 29
Last week we celebrated Lita Albuquerque’s glorious performance-art piece “Spine of the Earth 2012.” This weekend art connoisseurs and creative folk alike can rejoice in the splendor that is the Museums Free-For-All.
This Saturday and Sunday, an extensive assortment of museums will open its doors to the public for free, serving as the perfect weekend adventure for the broke college student looking to have fun on a budget.
Museums participating in the event include notable galleries like The Annenberg Space for Photography, which is currently showing Digital Darkroom — the progressive exhibition that showcases the fusion of art and technology — and The Getty Center, which is now exhibiting the highly discussed Pacific Standard Time: Crosscurrents in L.A. Painting and Sculpture, 1950-1970.
The Hammer Museum, The Skirball Cultural Center and The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, among many other galleries, will also open their doors free-of-cost.
What more could art fans ask for?

Puppets: When we were little, they often amazed us. Shows such as Sesame Street and Punch and Judy effortlessly held our attention with magical moving figurines.
Animated instruments · Fiesta, a marionette theater show, explores Hispanic culture with flying skeletons from Día de Los Muertos, dancing cacti and multi colored, self-playing guitars that possess surprisingly fluid motions under the expert guise of master puppeteers. - Photo courtesy of Bob Baker Marionette Theater
Despite their long success with children, puppets do not have that much of an audience with older crowds — Jim Henson might have captured the imagination of millions with his Muppets, but he’s firmly in the realm of the exceptional.
Before The Muppets film came out last year, people hadn’t heard much from the seminal series in years, let alone any other mainstream puppet-based entertainment.
Part of the reason? The disbelief of mature audiences is much harder to suspend. It’s simply much more difficult to make adults forget there is a hand in the puppet long enough for them to enjoy the narrative.
The Bob Baker Marionette Theater understands this. It also knows who the bread-and-butter audience is: children.
Performers grab hold of the childrens’ imaginations firmly and put on a show so good-hearted that it works through that pesky suspension of disbelief.
But sometimes adults can enjoy these old-fashioned shows too.
The Bob Baker Marionette Theater has opened another run of Fiesta, a show that the legendary establishment has featured on and off since it opened 50 years ago.
Fiesta’s age, however, doesn’t show in its content. Flying blue-lit skeletons, egg-laying ostriches, juggling clowns and ice-skating men with oversized sombreros come out one after the other. Fiesta fully embraces its childlike spirit — something essential for a show this irreverent to work.
Eschewing the usual puppet show format, which involves a stage tall enough to hide the puppeteers, the handlers of Fiesta’s characters walk with them in full view, letting the puppets interact directly with the mostly young patrons.
It’s obvious the youngest attendees, watching in amazement at the singing parrot sitting on their lap, forget that the puppeteers are right in front of them. And part of Fiesta’s appeal is that the puppeteers choose not to hide.
Fiesta does not aim for your disbelief. It’s a show that wants your love and respect, from the joy in the performances to the skill with which they are executed. The show also aims to please your stomach; included with every ticket is free ice cream after the show.
Bob Baker established the theater 50 years ago after touring with his puppets, and one of his first shows was Fiesta. Living up to its name, the show celebrates Hispanic culture in a way only a children’s puppet show can. Dancing cacti, Día de Los Muertos skeletons flying across a suddenly darkened room and an adorably charming rendition of “The Hat I Got for Christmas is Too Big” show off very clever marionette work.
The characters seem to have all been perfected over the years, and Fiesta progresses like a wonderful technicolor locomotive. There’s perfect timing between each skit, with many of the show’s talented performers transitioning perfectly from one role to another.
Unfortunately, until someone starts an über-innovative puppet show like the one in Being John Malkovich, marionette shows will remain a mostly unheralded and unseen sector of the performing arts, relegated primarily to younger audiences.
Bob Baker’s Marionette Theater comes close, appealing to audiences of all ages.
In any given show, the majority of spectators will be children and their parents because that is, in general, who will appreciate the magic of Fiesta the most. The charm of the show, however, is definitely not reserved for younger audiences.
If any evidence is needed for that claim, here’s this: there were two other college-aged groups of guys and girls in attendance that day, laughing and enjoying themselves among the kids.
And this attention from motley audience members is well deserved. The creative force that Baker infused into this show, as well as the infectious passion of its cast, is obvious. And the creativity and experienced showmanship that Fiesta’s skits contain give the production a standing far better than that of a simple childrens’ show.

In America, sharing files is a criminal act. In Sweden, the practice is now a religious experience.
Last month, Sweden officially recognized The Missionary Church of Kopimism. The religion sees all information as sacred; thus, file-sharing is a holy act. The founder, Isak Gerson, hopes Kopimism’s followers will one day have the freedom to transmit copyrighted information without “fear of persecution.”
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
Kopimism makes the SOPA protests look tame. Wikipedia might have shut down for a day, but it doesn’t have any disciples.
Still, as whacky as Kopimism sounds, the church is a legitimate manifestation of our generation’s shifting concept of ownership.
Kopimism was founded by a 19-year-old philosophy student. Like us, he’s used to having megabytes upon megabytes of information at his fingertips; he’s used to accessing images, texts and sound with little to no restriction.
The way Gerson sees it, sending a file isn’t committing a crime. At best, it’s spreading knowledge. At worst, it’s harmless sharing. Anything from a stick figure sketch to a full-length film is fair game.
Moreover, people who have this mindset make almost no distinction between finished products and creative tools. A song is just a jumping point for another tune, and every video merits a spinoff.  Everything can be remixed.
Governments all over the world are trying to curb file-sharing. Even if SOPA never passes in the United States, legislators agree that they have to stop piracy.
But file-sharing doesn’t have to be a problem in the first place. What if copyright laws are just outdated?
Copyright laws exist to protect creators from imitation and ensure that they get rewarded for their work. The laws are supposed to foster innovation. Lawmakers assume that if creators know they’ll receive recognition and money, they’ll be more likely to create.
That assumption is by no means unfounded, but it doesn’t account for the thousands of people who generate content on the Internet.
Most bloggers are unpaid. Many photographers on Flickr share their photos with the public without asking for attribution. Plenty of programmers have left their mark on open-source software, knowing they won’t get credit or cash.
The real joy of creating is seeing one’s vision come alive, not getting a check in the mail.
Defenders of the current copyright laws would counter that many people depend on them for their livelihoods.
The big Hollywood studios that rallied for SOPA are — in spite of their complaints — raking in more money than ever. But artists, writers and inventors who operate on a smaller scale don’t make such huge profits. They pay the bills by getting paid for their work.
In all honesty, I don’t have a solution for these creators. I don’t know how to protect them from millions of Internet users. All I know is that it’s an impossible and fruitless task.
Unless the United States wants to track every citizen with the intensity of a totalitarian government, people will continue to send each other copyrighted material. This generation’s attitude toward file-sharing isn’t going to change.
Ultimately, lawmakers and businesses are the ones who need to adjust themselves to our attitude shift.
Journalists are already trying to change the way they make money. The television, movie, music and tech industries should also start rethinking their revenue models; otherwise, people will start calling them dying industries too.
Is Gerson’s religion an elaborate practical joke? Possibly. But whatever his intention is, Kopimism already has more than 3,000 followers.
Maybe you’ll be next.

Many egregious abuses are conducted by means of copyright. Aside from making people like Chaim Saban a Hollywood billionaire able to quash Oliver Stone’s humanized portrait of Hitler in “The Secret History of America” (the Showtime miniseries you’ll never see), it is the means by which the government of Germany (Bavaria, actually) has prohibited reprintings of “Mein Kampf,” and will continue doing so at least until 2015 (70 years after the author’s death).
Such acts are an affront to MY religion. So if you happen to disagree with me about any of this, do so with the utmost sensitivity, please.

In honor of Roe v. Wade’s 39th anniversary, Trojans need to talk sex.
The misogynist fraternity email last semester was a difficult episode in our school’s recent history, but it did spur something refreshing: students speaking of their own experiences to other students. Women stood in front of Tommy Trojan and shared their sexual health struggles to find that they were not alone.
On Monday in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, we saw a similar evolution in the campuswide debate. Speakers from Planned Parenthood paired up with the College Democrats, Students for Barack Obama and the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics to raise awareness of sexual health issues on campus.
At the well-attended event, students took advantage of the opportunity to tell their stories. In simply talking about sexual health, they discovered just how many students have had pregnancy scares, have had to confide in friends about sexual health complications or have known someone who has had an abortion.
These stories are not unique to USC. But we don’t talk about them much. In campus life, it’s everywhere and nowhere.
Planned Parenthood — many students’ last refuge for help with sexual health issues, free contraception and other not-for-profit health care — is under political attack. Because one of the many reproductive health services that Planned Parenthood offers is abortions, the organization has become a target for a right-wing attack on sexual health education.  The war on science has opened a new front. The solution? Government just big enough to fit into your bedroom.
Sex education in schools, by the tone of most conservative dialogue, should take its cues from the Jonas Brothers rather than educators who know that abstinence-only education doesn’t work. In this year’s campaign, while most issues are drowned out by talking points about economic reform, the debate over reproductive rights sticks out like a sore thumb.
All the Republican [presidential] candidates oppose a woman’s right to choose. Some candidates have even backed a failed Mississippi ballot initiative that would have made personhood start at conception. The GOP candidates have played to the extreme base of their party by promising to appoint a justice that would overturn Roe v. Wade. This historic victory for reproductive rights celebrated its 39th anniversary this past Sunday, yet it is still under siege.
These politicians send the message to women that our bodies are not our own. We have to take back ownership by talking about our bodies in our own right.
It’s time we talked about sex.
Kaya Masler
Senior, president of USC Students for Barack Obama
Dear Anon and Anon,
Thank you for your comments! This is exactly the sort of discussion I wanted to start and I wish both of you had been at the event on Monday where we heard from a very diverse set of perspectives. You are right to point out how complex this issue is. I also did discuss it within the only page that I had and I in no way intended to ‘distill’ or simplify the topic. I also do not bring up the conservative perspective assuming that their personal views on sexual health are invalid. My point regarding this year’s ever popular GOP candidates is that given the incredible complexity of the issue, we should not be hearing from one, predominantly homogeneous perspective. The horse race of today’s politics is one of the few arenas wherein reproductive health is talked about at all and this is a problem on a number of levels: The first is the personal, as a woman, my body and what I am allowed to do with it is being discussed in a nationally broadcasted conversation that I, and most other women have no way of contributing to (or at least very little–if we are lucky a page in an op-ed or a soundbite on the news). Second, is the issue of biographical credibility that many of these candidates lack when it comes to female reproductive rights. Has Rick Santorum ever had to worry about being pregnant? Does he have any idea what it would feel like to bear the child of a person who raped him? I’m not saying that we should exclude him from the discussion because he does not have first hand experience with these issues but I do find it to be an injustice that a woman who does have these experiences can not respond to him when he says that pregnancy through rape is “a gift from god” and that “she should make the best of it” or when Newt Gingrich dictates that “choosing abortion is not acceptable.” I think we can all agree that an abortion is never an easy decision and I don’t pretend to have the answer to any one else’s question in regards to what they will find to be acceptable or unacceptable for themselves. Questions of abortion, contraception and sexual health as a whole, are questions that women and men must figure out the answers to on their own, based on their religions, their living situations, their families and their mental and physical health. I would never dream of answering these questions for anyone else. I haven’t even begun to answer some of them for myself. However, with out an open conversation about the experiences of others it is difficult to make any healthy progress in answering these personal questions, especially when what little is shared comes from such a strange and distant place as campaign politics. So, to answer your questions, that is what I want more talk about and why I want it and I hope you continue to keep up the discussion!
The point, Anon, is that one side of this debate is extremely well-organized and vocal whereas the other side barely talks about the issue. Roe vs. Wade has been promised to be overturned by every Republican presidential candidate yet, for all the talk of Newt’s sex life or Romney taxes, we don’t talk about ISSUES. I for one am grateful for Kaya starting the process of talking about policy rather than personality
You take an incredibly complicated subject and distill it into a page. In truth, I am actually closer to your side of this argument than the Conservative one, but to be so black-and-white about an intrinsic (and important) institution of society is not conductive to a serious dialogue, which you claim to want.
I am no strong supporter of either side of the Roe v. Wade debate, but to make it seem preposterous that people might have a serious problem with abortion is grossly dismissive. And I agree that sex education and contraception are both necessary and pragmatic, and Republican insistance that simply eliminating any mention of sex or the means of contraception from minors will stop what they see as immoral behavior is both outdated and out of touch. But just because their solutions are unhelpful does not mean that they don’t have a valid point. I do not pretend to know where the boundary between sexual liberty, long overdue for women, and corrosive behavior begins, but neither should you. And, applying the same standard to conservatives, I do not think that they should force their morals (abstinence, pro-life) on you, nor take for granted your arguments.
But by being so didactic about complicated moral issues, you are no better than them. The question of the life of a child vs the liberty of women is nuanced and has a many implications. Questions about sex in an age of teenage pregnancy, STDs, and abortions need to be asked.
But don’t pretend to know the answers beforehand.
Thanks Anon,
The sad truth is that anyone who expresses any distaste of this letter’s formulation will have to remain anonymous. Just the nature of the beast.
Good point on the fact that a complicated issue cannot be solved with a simple answer. The lack of nuance in this letter is evidenced by the fact, as you pointed out, that the author offers an equally unsatisfactory and frankly equally distasteful coloration of the “other side” of the debate without really offering any real solution. 
Let’s “talk about sex?” What more “talk” do you want? Be concrete, please, and don’t hinge your argument on demeaning your opponents.

Vas Defrans, a progressive rock band from North Hollywood, is currently streaming the first four songs off of its debut self-titled EP on SoundCloud.
Since the EP’s release on Jan. 2, Vas Defrans’ Facebook wall has become no stranger to positive and constructive feedback.
All that feedback has a refreshing and solid group of songs to back it up.
The band’s style and artistry provides a lot of depth and layers within each song.
Vas Defran music strays away from what most would consider traditional. It can capture a listener’s attention from the very beginning and keeps them hooked until the final note is played.
The guitar work of Dash LeFrancis and Cary Singer, a USC Popular Music student, is innovative and allows each track to progress to a new place, similar to going on a journey. There are a ton of intricate and fast-paced riffs, especially in “Cognition Scars.”
Every successful band must have a firm foundation. That foundation consists of the bass player and drummer. Vas Defrans’ bassist Max Whipple and drummer Kane Ritchotte work together in ways to provide consistent and interesting ways to build up and then break down patterns.
The best example of this teamwork is clear in “In Between Time and a Race.” It actually shows how well the entire band works together to create a cohesive song.
Another appealing aspect of Vas Defrans is the vocalist’s voice. Vincent Coleman has a voice with rock influences, but also hints of soul. It adds a little special something to the EP.
Vas Defrans will be celebrating at its record release party at The Bootleg Theatre on Feb. 5.
The party will also be a benefit concert for Xander’s Plan, an organization inspired by Xander, a young model and professional driver who is now paralyzed after being hit by a car. Xander’s Pan aims to raise funds for youth in need.
The band has a special treat for USC students first though. It will be playing at Tommy’s Place on Feb. 3.
Until then, the entire EP is available on iTunes and according to Vas Defrans, live performance videos are coming soon.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced their nominations early Tuesday morning, which included both surprises and snubs in their picks.
The Academy’s rule that anywhere from five to ten films could be nominated for Best Picture marks this year the first time in the history of the Oscars that nine films have been nominated for the category.
The biggest surprise came in the form of a nomination for Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, which drew a gasp from the audience when the film was announced. The film has been overlooked in previous awards shows and the Academy’s decision to honor the film shows them once again playing it safe with their choices. The film is one of the lowest reviewed films in recent years to have secured a Best Picture nomination. The Tree of Life also secured a surprising nomination, providing some relief for fans who were afraid the poetic film would be snubbed.
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, instead, was left off the Best Picture category, despite picking up PGA, DGA and WGA nominations. The film undoubtedly scared off old-fashioned Academy voters and failed to match any of these nominations, and instead picked up a surprising and deserving nomination for Rooney Mara.
In the category of Best Actor, George Clooney, Jean Dujardin and Brad Pitt all picked up their expected nominations. Leonardo DiCaprio and Michael Fassbender, who were considered safe bets, were left out of the race. Gary Oldman, instead, received his first Oscar nomination for his performance in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, while Demián Bichir picked up a nomination for his little seen independent film, A Better Life.
Terrence Malick worked miracles with a nomination for Best Director over other hopefuls such as David Fincher, Tate Taylor and Steven Spielberg. The filmmaker was nominated alongside expected nominees Michel Hazanavicius, Alexander Payne, Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen.
The 84th Annual Academy Awards will be held at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood on February 26, 2012.
