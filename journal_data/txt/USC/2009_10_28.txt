In 2006, USC approved plans to replace the outdated University Park Health Center, which has just half the space of health centers at comparable schools, according to executive directory Dr. Lawrence Neinstein.
But despite the major problems with the current UPHC, the plans for the new health center have been halted and the timeline for construction remains indefinite.

“This particular project was put on hold in the pre-construction process,” said Robert Cooper, vice provost for planning and budget. “USC had a hiring and salary freeze along with a construction freeze for many projects. We couldn’t delay the campus center and other things that were already in progress, but this got put on hold.”
Neinstein said there has been debate about creating a new health center for almost 15 years. The current health center, he said, is lacking compared to other schools.
“The average standards are two or three exam rooms per clinician, and we don’t even have one per clinician,” Neinstein said.
The number of visits to the health center has increased from 31,000 visits in 1995 to 81,000 visits last year, Neinstein said. He said the health center is undersized for the number of students it serves, and that affects the flow of traffic and wait times.
“We want to offer what we should be having in a health center,” Neinstein said. “For students, it’s going to offer shorter waiting times, more privacy and a more state-of-the-art outpatient center.”
Though this new health center has been in the works for a while, the struggling economy stopped the plan in its tracks — it has not gone beyond the pre-construction phases.
“We’re going through the architectural design and site placement and everything that would get us to what the building would cost to construct,” Cooper said.
Cooper said the stall is a safeguard against an uncertain economy.
“It was more preemptive, not really knowing where the economy was going to go,” Cooper said. “This was not the only project that was put on hold. It doesn’t mean we’re not doing them, but they’re on hold until we get a better idea of where the investment markets are going.”
Cooper could not give an estimate as to how much the construction will cost, as size and design have not yet been finalized.
Neinstein said the health center will likely be built in USC’s signature style — with a red brick exterior. It will likely be located in the parking lot directly behind the Lyon Center, he said.
Despite the temporary stop, those involved in the project hope construction will get underway soon.
“We’re hoping that this will move forward in the next four to six months,” Neinstein said. “Once you get the green light, construction would probably begin in about nine to 12 months and take another two years to finish.”
Some students said USC should do everything in its power to expedite the process.
“I’ve been to the health center before and it wasn’t the facilities that were that bad, it was the service was really slow,” said Addison Lee, a senior majoring in economics. “It felt really cramped, and I was bumping into people when I was on my crutches, which was not safe.”
Other students, however, say constructing a new health center is not an urgent matter.
“I think it’s a ‘yes’ and ‘no’ thing. ‘Yes’ being in that helps cut down on the red tape that sometimes occurs at numerous college health centers,” Kazi Nafis, a senior majoring in neuroscience, said. “‘No,’ in that the campus already has a pretty decent health center on campus, so there is no need to create more buildings when there is a building already functioning properly.”
I agree.
In contrast to the fact that a new health care facility is not exactly needed at an urgent manner, they need to be really strict about being up-to-date with new medical technology. I mean, who’s to say that some sort of new deadly virsus has just devloped in the area and is spreading like wild fire, won’t come about and the medical center will not be prepared?
Even though some might say a new health care facility is not an urgent matter, they still should continue to build it so it will be up to date on the new medical technology.

USC’s Department of Public Safety announced in September that they would be cracking down on bike safety and security, but more than a month later students continue to break the rules of the road without consequence and DPS says they don’t have the resources to follow through.
“Quite frankly, there are so many bicycles that it’s impractical,” DPS Capt. David Carlisle said. “We would impound more bicycles than we have room to store.”
Locked up · Jack Buntmann, an undecided sophomore, locks his bike in front of the Student Union, where there are no bike racks. Though the Department of Public Safety threatened to impound all unsecured bikes, few students have had their bikes impounded. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
Early in the semester, DPS sent emails warning students that bikes not secured to racks would be impounded. But students said they have not noticed any change, and DPS says it simply doesn’t have the resources necessary to handle all bike offenses.
Unsecured bikes can be found all over campus, but few are ever actually impounded.
Instead of impounding, Carlisle said DPS has been relocating bikes to areas near racks.
In an effort to combat another bike safety issue — riding in crosswalks and on the wrong side of the street — DPS also distributed fliers listing the “Rules of the Road” and cautioned students that bicyclists who broke traffic laws would be ticketed by LAPD.
Though LAPD, in conjunction with DPS, cracked down on biking laws one day in late September, and occasionally stations an officer at major intersections, students continue to violate traffic laws, biking through intersections and riding on the wrong side of the road.
“It’s still the same,” said Franklin Lopez, a sophomore majoring in civil engineering, of the new initiatives. “Nothing has changed.”
DPS Chief John Thomas said that though bike safety is a big problem, DPS hasn’t put the brake on bicycle violations because they want to give students an opportunity to change their habits themselves.
“We have been giving students an opportunity to correct the behavior themselves,” Thomas said. “We’re giving as much time as possible for students to self-regulate.”
But some students think the infrequent LAPD presence is already too much.
“It’s a waste of time; they should be doing something else,” Lopez said. “It’s a waste of resources.”
Thomas agreed that LAPD has more important things to do than hand out tickets to bikers.
Carlisle added that the problem was complex, and would require more work than just citations and tickets.
“There’s no simple answer to the problem,” Carlisle said. “It’s not uncommon for students to ride on the wrong side of the road. I find it particularly annoying that I have to stop for bikes — annoying and illegal — but bikes are a problem with no simple solution.”
Last year, DPS specifically dedicated more of their resources to the campus bike problem, with more DPS officers warning students about violations. The problem became more manageable and it seemed students were better handling the situation, Thomas said.
“Now students are regressing,” he said. “We’re seeing more students going back to the way it was, going back to the same old habits.”
My main concern as a biker is avoiding the bikers and pedestrians who are on the wrong side of the road. Oftentimes, these are the people who are talking on their cellphones, oblivious to their surroundings.  And as long as I know people who have been tackled off their bikes at intersections, I will not stop.
LAPD and DPS… help me feel safe.  Stop this silliness of citing people for riding in crosswalks, and stop those who text/talk on their cellphones while riding.  Stop those who ride on the wrong side of the road.
At 2:45 in the afternoon, am I really being unsafe, riding carefully through in a crosswalk, when there are at most 5 pedestrians crossing?  I sincerely hope that the Master Plan will help me, not requiring me to make an unprotected left turn from McClintock onto Jefferson.  By far, the safest way to make a left turn is on the crosswalk.
My main concern as a pedestrian is to be able to safely cross campus without being hit by a bike, skateboard, motorized whatever.
Why not try having designated bicycle areas, say, around the periphery of the campus, with enough biclycle racks there for parking.  Bikes would be allowed on the roads, of course, and maybe wide paths such as Trousdale Parkway.   Red traffic cones could separate bicycles from pedestrians.  Once the rules are clear, enforce them.
Any able-bodied student should be able to walk in the interior of campus.  The rest of us do.
I am surprised by some of these responses.  As a graduate of USC 03 ( I never had a bicycle in 4.5 years) I have never seen the bike problem so serious, I see a big diffusion of responsiblity by the students who seem to think that a bicycle is a magical device that allows them to ride anywhere without sonsequece.  As a current staff member I have the unenviable job of sometimes going to California Hospital to interview some of those unlucky students who have just learned a painful lesson, sometimes it can be serious.  If you don’t beleive me ask other USC staff members they are sick of bicycles and all the issues they cause…most students never really will understand unitl something happens to them or someone they know:(
In summary, whether you are moving by foot, bicycle, or car:
Quit being a moron. Pay attention.
Is it really necessary to ride a bike all over campus? Why not have the bike parking in certain peripheral areas to allow for the students to ride to campus, then – walk to classes. If you have a class on the other side of campus, ride it around the exterior of the campus. It is too dangerous and the bikers go in these small narrow places just not meant for bikes and pedistrians.
@ MC
Is this really your serious solution? Clearly you put a lot of thought into that. Maybe we can all drive on campus? Helicopters should be able to land on a few spots on campus, too. That should ease the congestion.
Or, you could leave things relatively similar to the way they are. Cyclists simply need to focus when riding and not be texting or making phone calls. Pedestrians also need to LOOK where they are going. Just because you are on foot, doesn’t give you a license to become a fool. I had an incident a couple of weeks ago where the sidewalk narrowed and I slowed down and eventually came to a stop, waiting for the pedestrian to look up…she was texting. She walked in to me. I was stopped. Take a peek next time before you cross; you’d do that for a car wouldn’t you?
I think the only real solution is major bicycle restriction.  I have attended several campuses in the southern california and I have never seen anything like what happens on a daily basis at USC.  USC is to small to accomadate every single student who wants to ride instead of walk.  A severe restriction on riding into the campus will finally free the USC campus from the bike monster.
@ Pedestrian:
   I completely appreciate and sympathize with your perspective.  As a commuter, I am now more frequently a pedestrian on campus than a cyclist.  Both of those incidents violate existing rules about how cyclists are to operate on walkways.  The relevant law is LA Municipal Code 56.15 which prohibits riding on the sidewalk with willful or wonton disregard for the safety of persons or property.  A cyclist that collides with a pedestrian is in obvious violation and should be cited.  Additionally, California state law prohibits talking on a handheld mobile device while operating a vehicle.  A cyclist on a sidewalk is in a grey area, but it would be easy for DPS to establish as part of their campus bike policy that cyclists may not ride while using a cell phone to call or text.
   The issue that cyclists face, and the reason that LAPD and DPS have not earned the cycling community’s respect, is that rather than enforcing reasonable existing rules, they seem to make them up on a whim.  To be fair to the officers, they are often trying to “do the best they can” to improve safety for everyone.  But, the ad hoc approach to cycling enforcement neither changes behavior or improves safety.
   In the state of California, bicycles operating on the roadway have all the rights and responsibilities of a motor vehicle.  The applicable code is CVC 21200, which requires cyclists to ride as far right as practicable, among other things.  In the City of LA, bicycles are permitted to ride on the sidewalk as well.  LAMC 56.15 requires the cyclists to operate without disregard for the safety of pedestrians.  USC’s policy is to follow the CVC, but also permit cycling on pedestrian pathways.
   The confusion results from all the grey areas where cyclists must transition from being vehicles to pedestrians and vice versa.  Particularly at Hoover and Jefferson, there are no options to enter campus without becoming a pedestrian on the campus side of the street, regardless whether the cyclist came from University (a walkway) or Hoover (a roadway).  At McClintock and Jefferson, there is an option to wait for the vehicle light after the pedestrian cycle, but it would continue to be inconvenient.  Furthermore, cyclists coming on the sidewalk from Orchard should use the pedestrian cycle because they are legally using the sidewalk as pedestrians.
   DPS and LAPD need to do a better job training their officers on the applicable regulations.  LAMC 56.15 is adequate to cite cyclists for riding recklessly without going to great lengths or making up laws (such as no riding in crosswalks).  Avid Cyclist is correct that the yellow signs are advisory, not regulatory.

Eric Bruins:  Question::
Would CVC 38300 apply to the situation on Jefferson-McClintock, when riding bicycles in the crosswalk?
“Division 16.5, Chapter 5, Article 1
Off-Highway Vehicles: Off-Highway Vehicle Operating Rules: Traffic Signs, Signals, and Markings
Unlawful to Disobey Sign, Signal, or Traffic Control Device
38300.  It is unlawful for the driver of any vehicle to disobey any sign, signal, or traffic control device placed or maintained pursuant to Section 38280.
Added Ch. 1093, Stats. 1976. Effective January 1, 1977. “
After reading this article i found it to agreeable. The LAPD is doing all they can and their job is not to babysit people/students who are beign careless about it. They don’t appreciate all that they do and if the student wants to be careless and leave their bike unlocked then it’s on them. They can’t just take advantage of them and expect them to be at their side taking care of their belongings while they live life day by day .
Honestly there are two problems:
Lack of bike options such as secure ample parking and designated paths
Lack of enforcement for actual laws and too much emphasis on other ineffective ‘unofficial’ rules
Easy solution:  Provide ample bike parking and designate certain lanes or areas for bike traffic.  With that, write citations to all of those who are actually endangering others such as biking on a cell phone without an earpiece.
You can’t simply ticket people and not offer improvement to an already overcapacity and neglected major portion of the student, staff, and faculty population.
PS Towing cheap bikes doesn’t particularly work since the point of a cheap bike seems to be the result of the fact that bikes are stolen far too often on campus thereby making them expendable.  Few will care if their cheap bike is towed because the status quo as it stands is no different than having it potentially stolen.
I’m a doctoral student in the evenings, a disabled individual, and a pedestrian, pleading for cyclists to be mindful of their responsibility. I walk from WPH (Rossier School of Education), across the pathway of Trousdale to get to Taper Hall. We’re talking 20-30 yards at the most. Twice, I have been hit by people on bikes who are either on their cell phone with one hand glued to their ear, or even better, the freshman who was texting with both hands on his phone, looking down, as he was pedalling at break neck speed. He can move faster than I can, and on a WALKway, I get hit. As I try to walk into Taper Hall, I have to navigate around bikes parked or just dropped on the ground, sometimes 10-20 bikes deep, just to get to the front door. My solution…bring a flatbed truck, and every bike not secured gets hauled away. Too bad ! Load ’em up and ship ’em out! If a student comes to claim their bike, DPS should cite them for not abiding by the rules of the campus. It has ben posted, printed, e-mailed, etc., thus fair and widespread notice has been made. It’s like tacking up a notice in the middle of the town square. If someone chooses not to read it, there is no fault on the one making the notice. Students have been put on alert. I have no sympathy if they don’t secure their bikes, or operate them in a safe manner.
I totally agree with “pedestrian” Haul away bikes not secured. Rules are rules. Why is everyone treating USC students with kid gloves. No one learns anything by coddling them this way.  And you don’t have to be disabled to get hit. I once got hit by a bike rider in another city, left unconscious in the road,  and am still paying for it! Head injuries, head aches, neck problems. It is not fun. It is unbelievable how students ride while texting and talking on their cell phones. This is the height of arrogant, non caring disrespect for life. I felt such relief about the idea of tickets being issued and hoping that would control this out of hand problem. But  now they are waiting it out giving it more time?? Since when does anyone think students will “self regulate”??  Are you kidding me?? So everyone is bending over backwards to ENABLE students to continue BREAKING THE LAW! I repeat they are BREAKING THE LAW!!! What has to happen for anyone to take this seriously and put an end to this reckless riding that endangers not only the bike riders but everyone and anyone around them and that includes drivers in cars trying to get through Jefferson as bikes come at them from the opposite direction in THE WRONG LANES. Thanks again, DPS, Carlisle and USC for doing NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! to keep the rest of us students safe.
I agree with your statement.  I believe there is definitely room for improvement in signage around campus and at intersections.  I believe that DPS and the LAPD should be targetting unsafe bicycle riders (especially those using cellphones and riding on the wrong side of the street).
I believe your argument would be more sound if you refrained from making unfounded and unfair claims, such as your claim that students riding while texting/talking on cell phones is the “height of arrogant, non caring disrespect for life.”  I do not believe that anyone is bending over backwards to enable students to continue breaking the law.  I believe that police and DPS are simply unsure of how to enforce the laws which apply to bikes.  Also, it is not against the law to leave a bike unsecured.  It’s just irresponsible.
My issue with the citations is the lack of respect that the police officers show when giving these citations.  It makes us bikers believe that we are not meant to be on the streets.
I don’t think you understand how scary it is to be on the road with two-ton vehicles.  The drivers are not in danger.  Bikes are like flies compared to cars.  Making that unprotected left turn from McClintock onto Jefferson on a bike is impossible, and dangerous.  Bikers need some protection, too.
Many cyclists are mindful of their responsibilities.  Many cyclists would never use their cell phone while riding.
I sympathize with your problems at Taper Hall.  I have the same problem at VKC.  Plus, it is difficult to find park when bicycles block bike racks.  The bikes which are left on the ground are an unfortunate consequence of a lack of parking.  As far as I know, it is not against the rules to leave a bike unsecured.  It’s just dumb.
Has it really been posted, printed, and emailed?  I must have missed that.
From my point of view, the real nuisance is skateboarders, who lack brakes.  Yes, they can hop off their board, but that board keeps rolling.  Skateboarders (especially longboarders) also lack the mobility of cyclists.  When will skateboarders be subject to the scrutiny which cyclists are experiencing now?  Why are skateboarders allowed to ride through crosswalks?
Yeah, cyclists should be careful and obey the laws.  If there aren’t the necessary resources available for them, than something should be done to take care the problem.  Bringing in the LAPD doesn’t solve the situation, it just brings intimadation and awareness for when they are there and pulls valuable resources away from the city.  You have to find the root of the problem to solve it.
I agree with the above comments. There is no vehicle code or municiple code that says bicycles are not allowed in crosswalks. It is 100% legel to do so in Los Angeles. Just do it in a safe manner.
Students should be made aware of this and fight any citation for violating LAMC 56.15 in court. More often than not, the rider in question was not violating this code so long as they were riding in a safe manner and yielding to pedestrians.
I second what the commenter before me said!
First, the yellow signs AC mentioned. Second, here are the laws:
No biking on sidewalks in such a way that shows a “wanton disregard for pedestrian safety.” Unless you have an explicit ban on biking across intersections, I would consider them to be pedestrian walkways, right? By riding in a crosswalk, you’re a bike in a pedestrian area, just like you would be on the sidewalk. So, if you’re biking in a responsible manner in such a way that you won’t run anyone over, I’d be hard pressed to say that it constitutes a wanton disregard for safety.
You wanna ticket us for that, then go get City Council to actually pass a law to that effect.
…as far as the bike parking goes, there clearly need to be more racks in certain areas. The bookstore, Student Union… there are even a bunch of extra bike racks piled up under the steps of PED! Move them 10 feet out towards the book store, bolt those babies in, and that solves one of your problems.
Once there is enough parking, then there would probably be fewer transgressors and DPS could realistically enforce it.
I agree that the LAPD are completely wasting resources when they try to nail us cyclists on trivial issues. But remember your rights as cyclists and know the rules of the road!
For instance, know that in California, signs that have a yellow background are cautionary, meaning that they are not enforceable. The signs that tell you to walk your bike in the McClintock-Jefferson and Hoover-Jefferson intersections have these yellow signs, meaning that you break no law when you ride your bike in a crosswalk!
If the LAPD wants to get picky, they should really ticket riders who ride on the wrong side of the road and endanger other cyclists.
I agree. And it’s egregious when that LAPD motorcycle cop is hiding next to the “University of Southern California” marquee waiting, or trapping, those who ride their bicycles across the Hoover and Jefferson crosswalk. About a $500 violation—yep, talk about conspiracy in light of the dismal economy. That yellow sign is not a warning then. Any law students want to comment on this?
Avid Cyclist: FALSE!  You must have missed the part of CA law that states there are two ways to ride a bike: in the road, with traffic, obeying vehicular traffic laws OR on the sidewalk, riding more slowly, yielding to pedestrians, and WALKING YOUR BIKE ACROSS THE CROSSWALK.
Yes, that’s in the law.  Whether or not the posted signs are yellow is irrelevant because they serve as a reminder of CA statute.
Good job.
Educated Cyclist: Show me where CA states that you must walk your bike in the crosswalk.  Really.  According to the CVC, crosswalks are “the prolongation or connection of the boundary lines of sidewalks.”   If we can ride on the sidewalk (true), we can ride in the crosswalk.

Cheaper parking, bicycle congestion and problems with the Campus Cruiser system were just some of the issues brought up by students at two separate discussions focusing on transportation,  Wednesday.
Ten students participated in a focus group conducted by USC Transportation yesterday afternoon. Later that night, the Undergraduate Student Government hosted  a forum allowing students to learn about and discuss the various safety tools available.
Focused · Students met with a representative from USC transportation at The Lab on Wednesday to voice concerns as part of a focus group. A separate transportation forum was held Wednesday night. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
Students at the focus group asked the administration  about the possibility of cheaper parking on campus, and suggested that USC Transportation could offer shuttles to hotspots  around Los Angeles on the weekends.
Tony Mazza, director of USC Transportation, said he expected the feedback from the group to provide the department with an idea of what to work on for the following year.
“[Previously], our efforts at gathering student feedback have been limited to annual surveys,” Mazza said. “Since we haven’t conducted focus groups in the past, we’re very excited to gather fresh insight from the students.”
Judy Zhou, a junior majoring in public relations and participant in the focus group, said the event brought up a number of points  that would be useful for USC Transportation.
“They got to hear a lot of what the students are saying and it will help them to improve transportation, Zhou said.
For the 15 students who attended the forum, the issues were much the same, with a bigger focus on transportation safety.
The event was moderated by Helen Moser, USG director of campus affairs, and included a panel consisting of Capt. David Carlisle and Chief Carey Drayton from DPS, as well as Mazza and Jeff Shields, associate director of USC Transportation.
Moser asked the panel about the availability of DPS escorts for students who feel unsafe or unable to make their way home.
“Remember that DPS is responsible to not just the students that need rides, but every other student that might be involved in any other public safety situation,” Carlisle said. “Friday and Saturday nights we might be busy … particularly because of social events in North University Park.”
Moser also told the panel about students’ frustration with the Campus Cruiser system — specifically when callers are asked to use the trams or endure long waiting times.
In response, Mazza said if students felt they were in an unsafe area, they should tell the dispatcher about the situation.
“Sometimes I recognize you might get a pushback from dispatchers, who are students as well,” he said. “[But] if you insist on a cruiser to come pick you up, they will send you a cruiser.”
Audience members also questioned the panel on whether DPS could have the security ambassadors walk up and down their patrolled areas rather than stand in one spot, but Carlisle said DPS had a layered approach that is part of the security strategy with cameras in areas and people patrolling already on T3s and in DPS cars.
“We’ve tried to cover that area, so you choose to be on that highly visible path, [rather] than the most obscure place you can walk,” Carlisle said. “We’re trying to create a great sense of safety in community.”
Other topics covered included bicycle congestion and safety, the relative security of the parking structures and the availability of trams. Drayton said even though most of the concerns brought up were similar to others that he had heard before, the forum was still useful because it served as an advisory for those who attended.
“This … is an opportunity for people that want to hear about what’s going on,” he said.

As part of a continuing effort to encourage discourse between students and the local community, two USC students were appointed to open spots on a local neighborhood council, giving them the chance to weigh in on current developments near the University Park Campus.
The Empowerment Congress North Area Neighborhood Development Council, part of a citywide system of local forums, allows members of the public to discuss and oversee the development and growth of their individual districts.

“The fate of the campus and the community is linked,” said Daniel Wu, a senior majoring in interdisciplinary studies in urban studies, who was elected to the council .
Wu and Samantha Foley, a senior majoring in political science and international relations, were selected earlier this semester to fill open spots on the council, one of which was previously filled by alumnus Max Slavkin. Both said they plan to contribute to the neighborhood council by bridging the needs and concerns of students, faculty and staff with those of community members.
“I’m hoping to have a more cohesive environment between the community and students and bring the two groups together a little more, to make the community more comfortable with USC and vice versa,” said Foley, who had previously served as the director of campus affairs for the Undergraduate Student Government.
Foley said she joined to represent student interests and have a greater impact on the community.
“We’re dealing with the issues on a bigger scale than just the USC campus,” she said.
Wu served alongside Foley in USG as the assistant director of diversity last year. He also helped found the coalition of USC student organizations known as Campus and Community United last year. CCU promotes campus and community partnerships, inclusion and economic justice and works to sustain neighborhood opportunity through education, employment and affordable housing, Wu said.
“He’s got a lot of ideas on how to make the community more cohesive with the university,” Foley said.
Wu said one of his goals in joining NANDC is to transform abandoned sites in the area into community investments like a neighborhood opportunity center.
“Perhaps USC can partner with the Figueroa Corridor Land Trust to developed mix-use retail and affordable housing in that area and to really create a win-win situation,” Wu said. “There’s always more to be done.”
Wu and Foley started their work with NANDC by serving on the economic development committee to provide input and assistance for its two main projects: creating a campus and community farmer’s market and advocating select retailers for the University Gateway development.
The committee was created last year to address the needs of local residents and to gather community feedback through surveys and open-house events where community members are able to speak with developers, said Shawn Simons, president of NANDC.
The neighborhood council aims to facilitate a collaborative farmers’ market — bringing the area’s pre-existing markets together — to promote strong partnership in the community and encourage small business entrepreneurship, Wu said.
“It’s really trying to build on the infrastructure already in place,” he said.
Foley added that the unified farmer’s market plan is intended to make the market more accessible to both students and community members while providing a convenient location for vendors who wouldn’t be charged for a space in the market.
“It creates an environment where students and residents can interact with one another,” she said.
The retail component of University Gateway is another focus of NANDC, which plans to advocate for responsible stores and dining options that would function well in its location on the corner of Jefferson Boulevard and Figueroa Street.
“We’re working on having community input on the retail and restaurant space for all of the new developments that are going on,” Simons said.
The committee members are also preparing a community prospectus to attract appropriate retailers to upcoming projects, including those at Gateway and the University Village, to benefit the overlapping needs of students and local residents, Simons said.
In addition to their independent efforts and work with the committee, Wu and Foley also plan to use their year to also build awareness of the council on campus.
“Daniel and I are both seniors so once our positions are up in the spring, we’ll be looking for other USC students who are interested in joining the council,” Foley said. “It’s really crucial that USC students get involved because we are a big part of the north [university] area.”
Board members are currently elected to NANDC following the conclusion of USC’s spring semester at the end of June. They are attempting to move up the election to the school year, however, so they can increase student involvement, Foley said. Although no seats are designated for USC students, they are able to run for area-specific or at-large board seats.
“If students are interested, they should definitely come … and have their voices heard,” Simons said.
Kinda selfish there jim. Students have no more right to the community than the thousands of residents who live there year round. What are these businesses going to door the summer months? Just wait for students to come back, come on students need to cut out this entitlement crap, 4 years and you’re out anyways.
All power to the people!
I think the UNIVERSITY Gateway development and the UNIVERSITY Village development should both attract tenants for the UNIVERSITY students, not the surrounding neighborhood.  There is plenty of space on Fig and Vermont to develop projects geared toward the neighborhood at large, but these two developments should be centered on the Universities needs.

The No. 1 USC men’s water polo team takes the trip to No. 9 UC Santa Barbara this afternoon at 4 p.m. They are looking to continue a statistical balance that has brought them to the top of collegiate water polo this season.
Second in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in goals per game, the Trojans (18-1, 4-0), surprisingly, do not have a player among the leaders in goals per game in the conference. Senior two-meter Shea Buckner, who leads the team with 29 scores, ranks just 16th in the MPSF in goals per game, a statistic that speaks to just how spread out the team’s offense has been this season.

“We have an incredibly balanced team this year,” junior driver Devon Borisoff said. “Anybody can take over and have a great game, that’s what’s makes us so dangerous.”
The Gauchos (9-8, 0-1) have already experienced the multifaceted attack of the Trojans’ offense twice this season, but this will be the first time either team is considered the home team in the contest, as the other two meetings between the two teams were at neutral site tournaments.
In the two matchups between the squads, 17 different Trojans scored, including Buckner and Borisoff, and USC won both contests by a combined 25 goals.
“[In our victories] we just stayed focused on the gameplan and everyone focused on their own roles,” Borisoff said.
In stark contrast to the Trojans’ balanced offense, the Gauchos’ attack centers on junior Milos Golic, whose 42 goals this season is good enough to tie him atop the conference leaderboard.
Named last week’s MPSF Co-Player of the Week, Golic enters the match coming off a six-goal performance against Long Beach State last Saturday during a thrilling four-overtime loss against the 49ers. Golic scored four of the Gauchos’ final five goals.
Gaucho sophomore two-meter Noah Smith and utility player junior Zsombor Vincze, who combine with Golic for one of the MPSF’s leading trio of goal scoring teammates, will also put a strain on the Trojan’s defense, which ranks first in the MPSF.
In a quirk of scheduling and coincidence, the Trojans played three games before facing UCSB at the Triton Invitational, and now, with the season winding down, USC will have just three games remaining in the regular season following today’s matchup.
But as the MPSF Championships and a possible berth in the NCAA tournament approach, the Trojans don’t let the coming weeks throw them off track.
“It’s just business as usual,” Borisoff said.

The game had been tight all afternoon.
But with less than two minutes left in the September game and USC clinging to a 1-0 lead, Arizona State had a free-kick from 40 yards out. Almost every Sun Devil was in the box, and USC senior goalkeeper Kristin Olsen was trying to see the ball through the crowd of players. As one of the tallest players on the field at 6-feet, opposing players swarmed around her, looking to distract her in any way.

As the ball sailed into the box, an Arizona State player got a head on it and it beelined for the back of the net. But seemingly from the other side of the goal, Olsen flied through the air and snagged it at the apex of her dive. Game saved, USC wins. Olsen records another shutout.
It was just another play for Olsen, who has quietly become one of the best goalkeepers in the nation.
“It’s her athleticism and her ability to dive post-to-post. She gets to balls that I know people are saying, ‘That’s a goal,’” coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “But more than that, she handles the routine play very, very consistently and that’s huge.”
The stat sheet wasn’t that impressive, as Olsen recorded only four saves in that game. But stats can’t begin to describe how the charismatic goalkeeper, who loves to sing Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus and can recite every line from Finding Nemo, keeps USC together on the field.
The funny thing is, Olsen didn’t want to be a goalkeeper. She hated the idea of it. She grew up playing on the field as a forward, and that was her passion. At Villa Park High School in Orange County, Calif., she was named offensive MVP her junior year.
But her coach for the Southern California Blues soccer club couldn’t ignore her height and athleticism. A three-sport star at Villa Park, Olsen was named the school’s Female Athlete of the Year her senior year. So her coach stuck in front of the net, much to her chagrin.
“I hated it at first. I cried,” Olsen said. “I threw a fit. But I started training with a really good goalkeeper coach and it became a challenge for me. I just wanted to get better at it.”
She did, but her skills didn’t all come at once. Olsen sat behind Veronica Simonton her freshman year and admits she wasn’t happy with that position.
Yet Olsen, a devout Christian, believes things happen for a reason —  like what happened between her freshman and sophomore year.
Khosroshahin became the new coach and gave everyone a fresh start. Even with Simonton coming back for her senior season, there was no question for Khosroshahin who the starting goalkeeper should be.
“Our first impression was, ‘Wow, look at this kid, look how athletic she is and how comfortable she is with the ball at her feet,’” Khosroshahin said of Olsen, who is one of the fastest jugglers on the team. “She just had this presence to her, this confidence. There was no indecisiveness. It was obvious she was the best one.”
After playing in just two games during her freshman year at USC, Olsen saw the filed in just about every game her sophomore year and led the Women of Troy to their first national title. After the championship victory Olsen cried again, this time tears of joy.
“That year she just blossomed,” senior defender Meagan Holmes said. “She saved our butts in a lot of games and we couldn’t have won a national championship without her in the goal.”
Since then, Olsen has developed into a more complete player and a leader on and off the field for the Women of Troy. She is the all-time leader in wins and shutouts.
She also traveled with the US National Under-23 team this summer in England and Ireland and brought her game to a whole new dimension.
Olsen has needed to draw on all that experience this year as USC started two new players on the backline. Olsen was frustrated at first, but as a leader, she learned that the younger players needed her voice now more than ever.
“She’s able to help the younger kids see things defensively and offensively, because she can see the whole field. We count on her a lot to help us find solutions,” Holmes said. “I don’t hesitate twice when she tells me what to do. We respect her.”
Khosroshahin believes the sky’s the limit for Olsen.
“She has the potential to be one of the best keepers in this country,” Khosroshahin said. “Maybe the best goalkeeper this country’s ever had.”
Olsen plans on entering the Women’s Professional Soccer draft next semester and hopefully turning Khosroshahin’s prediction into reality. But she’ll be the first to say it’s not about her.
“Honestly, I don’t look at the numbers. I really rely on my teammates a lot. When we work well together, that’s when the results come forth. Statistics are one thing but what we do on the field is what really matters,” Olsen said.

Despite facing a unique Oregon offense on Saturday, USC’s defense expects a return to the familiar when it faces the Ducks at Autzen Stadium this weekend.
Oregon’s spread offense resembles the attacks that some of USC’s early season opponents employed. After facing Notre Dame and Oregon State, two pro-style offenses, and yielding 63 points, USC’s defense is getting back to its roots.

“This is like our bread and butter — we’ve been preparing for this since camp knowing that San Jose State was going to come out with [the spread] and Ohio State was going to use it,” linebacker Chris Galippo said. “It’s good to be back to some stuff we’re super confident with.”
The Ducks’ offense enters the game ranked second in the Pac-10 in scoring offense. After a season-opening loss to Boise State, Oregon has scored 31 points or more in five of their last six games.
USC coach Pete Carroll said that the Ducks’ offense was distinct from past opponents because of how much it relies on quarterback Jeremiah Masoli.
“They feature the quarterback running, even more so than Ohio State,” Carroll said. “This is a team that’s dedicated to having the quarterback run the option, so he’s much more part of the normal running game than just a guy who scrambles around.”
Masoli is the conference’s leading rusher among quarterbacks with 272 yards on 59 carries. The junior signal-caller suffered a right knee injury against Washington State but said this week he feels no ill effects after returning on Saturday.
“He knows how to run their system,” Galippo said. ”He’s the best guy for their system probably since [Dennis] Dixon.”
Beyond Masoli, USC’s defense is paying attention to tight end Ed Dickson. After giving up more than 100 yards to Oregon State tight end Joe Halahuni last week, the Trojans are figuring out ways to stop the Ducks’ leading pass catcher.
“He’s their go-to guy,” Galippo said. “We exposed ourselves a little bit last week, but we’re scheming up for that and we have stuff that’s going to take care of it.”
Oregon’s 43-19 win against Washington last week provided plenty of concern for Carroll. The Ducks had little trouble with the defensive schemes utilized by former USC assistant coaches Steve Sarkisian and Nick Holt.
“They moved the ball pretty well on them,” Carroll said of the Ducks’ offense last week. “They had a lot of run yards and were able to make some big plays on them. We’re not playing them the same way, but it’s still good to see it because there is some familiarity.”
u
Despite giving high marks to offensive linemen Jeff Byers and Butch Lewis for their performances last week, Carroll said he hoped to see Kristofer O’Dowd back to full health soon.
O’Dowd has been plagued throughout the season by injuries to the shoulder and knee. Despite being healthy enough to play, the junior center did not feel he was living up to his standard and moved to the bench against Oregon State.
“Kris did fine — he wasn’t playing poorly, he just wasn’t playing at his best,” Carroll said. “He was clomping around a little bit after the wear and tear of playing week after week. But I think he’ll come back strong and by this week or next week come back at a full clip, we hope.”
I am definitely looking forward to USC defense against the Ducks offense this weekend. Oregon has more a rushing type game, but is still number two in the Pac-10 for scoring when they’re on offense. The Ducks quarterback Jeremiah Masoli is perfect for their type of running game.  Masoli leads the conference 272 yards with 59 carries. Hopefully the Trojans defense can stop Masoli from gaining yards, and they end out with another win.

Most people circle their calendars every year on Oct. 31 because it’s Halloween.
Now don’t get me wrong, Halloween is a great holiday. It’s not every day of the year that men get to dress up in goofy costumes and women get to barely dress up at all.
It makes for a fun night.
But this year is a little different. The holiday could mean something so much more to the Trojan community.
Halloween just so happens to be on a Saturday. And what do Saturdays in October mean? That’s right: Trojan football.
This Halloween represents what might be the most important day left for the Trojans in their quest for not only a Pac-10 championship, but a national title.
I’ll start with the USC game.
No. 5 USC travels to Eugene, Ore. to face the No. 10 Ducks at 5 p.m. in a highly anticipated matchup of the two best teams in the Pac-10. A win for the Trojans sets them up for an unprecedented eighth straight conference championship under coach Pete Carroll.
But it’s no secret that the Trojans have struggled in the state of Oregon in the past three seasons. They have lost to the Oregon State Beavers twice in Corvallis and the Ducks once in Eugene.
Carroll said going up to Oregon is a challenge because Duck fans represent one of the best crowds he has seen in football, and that’s not just because of how loud they can be.
“They have a good attitude of the way they support their team. They are very outspoken,” Carroll said. “The noise is one aspect, but you can feel the intensity of their crowd, and they do a good job.”
The Trojans will have to bring their A-game on offense and fix their late-game defensive struggles to defeat a very solid, all-around Oregon team that has looked great after overcoming its season-opening loss to Boise State.
If USC pulls out the win, it will be in good shape in the Pac-10. Obviously, the Trojans will have to survive their remaining schedule, but it looks favorable.
But there’s another game on Halloween evening that Trojan fans should keep their eyes on.
One spot is still open for a shot at competing for a national championship.
If the top two teams — Florida and Alabama — remain undefeated throughout the rest of the season, they will meet in the SEC Championship game. There is going to be a loser that will not get to play in the Rose Bowl for the national title.
No. 3 Texas, however, still stands in the Trojans’ way. (So does No. 4 Iowa, but I’m banking on the Hawkeyes losing at Ohio State in a couple weeks.)
Let’s say USC ends its losing streak in Oregon. Its national title ambitions will still be in jeopardy unless No. 14 Oklahoma State can pull out an upset against Texas.
Why is so much riding on that game this weekend?
Because Oklahoma State is the only remaining threat in the way of an undefeated season for the Longhorns. If Texas wins, USC might as well kiss its title chances goodbye, because the Longhorns shouldn’t have too much trouble running the table against their last four opponents: UCF, Baylor, Kansas and Texas A&M.
For those of you wondering, those teams have a combined conference record of 4-9.
Unfortunately, history isn’t on the Cowboys’ side. They have not beaten Texas since 1997, and the Longhorns lead the all-time series 21-2.
If you look at the recent trend, though, the numbers aren’t so bad. In 2007, Oklahoma State led most of the game at home before losing 38-35 at the hands of a McCoy second-half comeback. Still, the Cowboys forced the quarterback to throw three interceptions in Stillwater, Okla., the site of Saturday’s contest.
And last season, the Longhorns barely eked out a 28-24 win in Austin, Texas, against those same Cowboys by holding Oklahoma State scoreless on two separate defensive stands to end the game.
Although the overall record is lopsided in Texas’ favor, it appears Oklahoma State is closing the gap.
So maybe, just maybe, this is the year the Cowboys break through.
And maybe, just maybe, this is the year the Trojans end their hex in Oregon.
And maybe, just maybe, this Halloween will be one to remember for USC fans and not just for the nighttime festivities.
So as two huge games collide on Halloween night, try to make the best of both worlds.
On Saturday, root for two teams: Go Trojans! Go Cowboys!
Then go trick-or-treating.
“Soft Hands” runs every other Thursday. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or email Jon at jhaber@usc.edu.
Coach Carroll needs to take the reigns off of Taylor Mays and let him play the game like he did last year.  Hitting hard and causing turnovers…..  Mays has not been hitting like he has been.  That nees to change on Saturday.
Fight on.

Eighty years ago today, thousands lost their wealth in a series of unfortunate economic events. As stock values plummeted, so did the Los Angeles pride that had been built up through the growth of California industry.
The infamous Black Tuesday launched a nationwide economic depression that caused staunch politicians in decades following to initiate programs to make ends meet for the countless unemployed, a good number of which were in Los Angeles.
One such endeavor, The US Work Projects Administration Federal Writers’ Project and Historical Records Survey, gave jobless teachers, librarians and writers a chance to make their living by compiling information for comprehensive guides to the great American cities — the centers for the nation’s collective suffering.
These guides revealed to readers both then and now a dated essence of resigned oddity tempered by the spirit of possibility and expansion that exists to this day, despite more than half a century’s worth of societal change.
LA’s addition to the “American Guide Series,” Los Angeles: A Guide to the City and its Environs, published in 1941, has no singular author to grace its spine. It is simply another product of the Federal Works Agency and Work Projects Administration, a compilation of hundreds of out-of-work writers that walked the streets of Los Angeles, a city that would sustain them after they humbly gave up their bylines. To this end, the words in the handbook have a sense of collective truth, a portrait divined by the teamwork of the artistic and underfed.
The guide, to say the least, is thorough. More than 400 pages illuminate Californian history and culture, a primer on then contemporary Angeleno culture. Photographs and illustrations give an overwhelming sense of what was 451 square miles of a mixed-up city, a series of suburbs connected by a culture so unique to the area.
But LA’s history can’t escape the inevitable romance tied with the sunny weather and mystical geology, threatening its citizens with small quakes and big rumbles at any given moment.
To preface the book, John D. Keyes, state supervisor of the Southern California Writers’ Project, quickly shot down the idea of a falsely idealized city, expressing his desire “to present Los Angeles truthfully and objectively … It has been lashed as a city of sin and cranks; it has also been strangled beneath a damp blanket of unrestrained eulogy. The book shows Los Angeles as a composite, a significant city.”
Keyes and the guide emphasize LA’s place in the country as the nation’s fifth largest city. “The Fifth City,” as the writers boast, was filled with idyllic parks, thriving businesses and a strangeness that seemed to only grow in between California’s citrus groves and almond blossoms.
The introduction of the guide was very much like the expression of educated awe of an outsider looking at the Los Angeles plain with wide eyes and an empty stomach.
The Los Angeles spirit is all encompassing, a climate that — to the East Coast transplant — “amazes and delights him, and thaws him out. There is a heady fragrance in the air, and a spaciousness of sky and land and sea … His curiousity is always whetted … He feels a certain strangeness … that is once exhilarating and disturbing.”
After all, the city’s residents made quirky fashion decisions: Most residents wore bright colors, girls sported colorful pants, housewives combined casual cotton dresses with furs to go to market, men refused to wear hats and — absolutely shockingly — women’s legs rejected conventional nylon stockings.
This noticeable characteristic of tolerance also created an architectural eclecticism that, even in the Great Depression, gave the city a skyline far more different from the ones of the Old World. The guide notes structures such as the LA Public Library, USC’s own Mudd Hall, LA’s collection of pretty Post Offices and the iconic Los Angeles Times building crafted what was then a low, jagged landscape of brick, stucco and adobe. Even now, the city’s lack of one iconic architectural design gives an insight to just how diverse the Los Angeles skyline truly is.
Writers also boast of the city’s self-sufficient nature, which stems from its great industries of motion pictures, food, airplanes, wine, automobiles and oil. These seemingly disparate commercial entities created both an atmosphere of a layered economic symphony and a multiplicity of faiths in both business and religion.
A short section is even dedicated to “The Business of Pleasure,” which elaborates on LA’s place in American culture as a place to escape, to amuse oneself in a limbo of temporary pleasure. There are ephemeral splendors here that allow tourists to reach upon the stars. Much more common, according to the guide, is the simple joy of experiencing the place firsthand, and thus, the guide provides easy driving tours of suburbs and must-sees clumped together by proximity.
Many of the landmarks still exist in the guidelines, but the highways and hotels have gone to ruin  in order to accommodate the contemporary Angeleno driver, but such journeys warrant a try; after all, making the trip from City Hall to Lake Arrowhead may uncover something special, something indescribably magically indicative of the culture and tradition of Los Angeles.
Though the guide is more than half a  century old, it still captures that nebulous spirit of a city shrouded in relative mystery. The quintessential Los Angeles can be seen in the guide’s visual elements: maps, photographs and illustrations show timeless images of men bowling on the green in Exposition Park, details of murals from the Federal Building and charming shots of the Lotus Pool in Echo Park, giving a representation of the wonders within the city. Though they’re in black and white, these images, like the text, are nostalgic, familiar and authentic, illustrating a city that’s at once at our fingertips and gone forever.

In Antichrist, a self-disemboweling fox utters the phrase, “Chaos reigns.”
Director Lars von Trier makes sure it really does, by illustrating every brutal detail necessary on screen and demonstrating just how horrifying chaos can be.

The movie stars Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg as He and She, a couple whose young son falls to his death out of a window while they are passionately having sex.
To counter the excruciating grief that follows, the couple decide to find sanctuary in their desolate cabin in a forest known as Eden. He, a therapist, attempts to help his wife by having her overcome her grief, but the grief is too much and She easily succumbs to it, propelling her towards horrendous violence and a horrifying climax.
Von Trier’s film is not the typical Hollywood horror affair because the director has his own sadistic, yet fresh perspective on how far horror can go. Instead of a dignified monster, the true horror comes from the many dimensions of fear and its capabilities to gruesomely disturb one’s consciousness. Von Trier’s villain is very real, and its roots form in psychology.
The film highlights fear’s effect on the body and mind, most specifically with She. She changes dramatically throughout the film, expressing radical contortions of sanity and stability, and, in order to convey such distortions of pain, von Trier made an excellent decision casting Gainsbourg. The often underrated actress shines in this grim narrative, her performance reaching far beyond boundaries that many Hollywood A-list actors would never dare cross.
Antichrist demands its actors to stand naked in the face of fear — figuratively and literally — and ultimately succumb to it, and Gainsbourg does just that. As the centerpiece of the film, Gainsbourg — who won the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival for her performance — endures most, but certainly not all, of the trauma that accompanies grief; to watch her immerse herself completely in something so horrible is feverishly thrilling to watch.
Dafoe counters Gainsbourg flawlessly with a supposed knowledge of the power of fear, but his insecurities soon get the better of him as well. The real charm to his performance is in his reactions to She; this is where his encounters with fear evoke the same horror within him.
Although both actors give fearlessly raw performances that truly make the film, Antichrist struggles with its own madness. Von Trier illustrates fear and its distortions through some of the most sadistic forms of bodily and psychological horror ever to be depicted on screen. The ludicrous and often very vile actions the two characters find themselves undertaking are erratically disturbing and often difficult to sit through.
As disturbing as these scenarios are, though, the mayhem eventually culminates into fascinating causation, but it is unfortunately overshadowed by the film’s tremendous amount of graphic violence. In relation to the overall meaning of Antichrist, every single depraved act is essential but not easily interpreted — that, of course, is a result of the extremity of the sadism. The grotesque imagery, while still unique, brings up many concerns, most notably that of misogyny as well as questions regarding the excessive use of traumatic images. Antichrist becomes lost here, amongst itself and it is very hard for it to find its way, even after the conclusion.
Most importantly, though, Antichrist says a great deal about the nature of mainstream films. As graphic and gruesome as it is, the film takes considerable risks. There is not a single film out right now that can compare to the intensity of Antichrist.
Although not for the faint of heart, this expression of horror will literally cause physical and emotional reactions to a degree no other contemporary horror film can match; by enduring the same notions of fear the characters do, the movie-watching experience changes significantly.
It is hard to find a film with such capabilities, and it is here that the importance of Antichrist as a film becomes prominent. There is really no telling when such an occurrence in film will happen again.

Those spindly legs that belie shockingly fast movement, the black eyes and pointed mandibles, the invisible webs that stick to the skin — there’s just something about spiders.
For anyone who hates arachnids, the Spider Pavilion at the Natural History Museum looms a greater test of courage than any slickly designed haunted house — putting your face up to a motionless orb-weaving arachnid seems infinitely braver than walking through a seizure-inducing set while actors jump out from behind every corner.
Home spun · The Spider Pavilion, located at the Natural History Museum, features an open-air terrarium where spiders roam freely and craft webs in plain view. The pavilion also hosts flashlight tag after sundown. - Amaresh Sundaram Kuppuswamy | Daily Trojan
The exhibit, open for six weeks from late September until early November, is a modestly sized open-air terrarium, which sits behind the museum itself.
Orb-weaving spiders have spread their webs across the air, with no glass or wire separating them from visitors, who are free to get as close as they want to the wide variety of colorful arachnids.
Robert Saldivar, a gallery interpreter for the museum, wanders the enclosure armed with a spray bottle and a brazen, friendly demeanor. He sprays the spiders — which absorb the water through their skin — and, without warning, will gladly reach out and touch the quiet creatures. The lack of fear he displays reflects the exhibit’s underlying theme.
“We’re afraid mostly because we know so little about them, even though they share our world, our gardens, our homes — they’re everywhere,” Salvidar explained. “So, at least for the people that are not completely arachnophobic, they can come in here, they can get closer, they can see that spiders are not made to kill humans.”
As recently as August, Spider Pavilion was known as Butterfly Pavilion, a wholly different display of swarming winged insects that, according to Salvidar, attracted a much younger crowd than the arachnid-themed exhibition. Some butterflies can still be seen fluttering aimlessly around the pavilion, though their lives have taken on a different purpose after the transition.
“They’re food,” Salvidar said bluntly. “They’re either late-emerging butterflies that were in their chrysalises, or they’re actually butterflies that were brought in intentionally to feed the spiders.”
Brent Karner, the manager of invertebrate living collections — although he prefers “the bug guy” — is the mastermind behind the unique exhibit. He discussed how his original idea stemmed from his experience with a similar butterfly pavilion at another museum in 1992 when the intrusion of a tiny local spider into the exhibit sparked his imagination.
“Here was this little tiny orb-weaver who was trying to take down a big tropical butterfly, and I got called over and people were horrified that a spider should be eating such a pretty animal and I was intrigued by it,” Karner recalled.
It took 12 years for the dream of Spider Pavilion to come to fruition, but once Karner realized the dormant potential in the butterly exhibit — the Pavillion of Wings, itself operating since 1999 and vacant five months of the year — he began testing what would become the Spider Pavilion.
“In 2004, realizing I had this space I could try the Spider Pavilion in, I threw some spiders in, saw what it looked like, figured it would work,” Karner said. “In 2005, we opened the first Spider Pavilion. And it ended up being so darn popular that we’ve been doing it ever since.”
Karner explained that while the Halloween tie-in does help draw in thrill-seeking crowds, the purpose of the exhibit is inevitably far more educational.
“We get that group of people that actually comes here for the same reason that people often ride roller coasters — that adrenaline rush. And the fact that we put it in concert with Halloween does help. This is that time of year when it’s okay to get the crap scared out of you a little bit,” Karner said. “It is our job to then introduce them to what’s really going on in there. We don’t want people to leave with greater fear or equal fear than what they came in with.”
The exhibit closes Nov. 8, and the night before Halloween marks the final opportunity for visitors to play “flashlight tag” with the spiders after sundown — an exciting prospect. Karner relayed how wandering the enclosure at night adds “a whole new flair to it.”
“You see spiders do different things at night. They just sort of appear out of the darkness,” he said.
Other than a potentially hair-raising nighttime visit, the only truly frightening part of the Spider Pavilion might be its small
antechamber, which the curators decided to fill with 12 small enclosures borrowed from the museum’s Insect Zoo. In these glass cages lurk the arachnids that truly creep around nightmares — tarantulas and black widows, brown recluses and scorpions.
But past an unreasonably huge Brazilian salmon tarantula, which twitches against the glass walls with some imagined malicious intent, Spider Pavilion becomes benign and really quite beautiful.
“The Spider Pavilion is hopefully one small step toward changing the minds of people. Even though the fear is deep-seeded in our society, there is still an odd respect for them. There is still some intrigue we have about this animal,” Karner said.
Spider Pavilion might not cure the impulse of anyone quick to step on a house spider invading his or her space, but it is a rare opportunity to see some of nature’s most unique designs and the often colorful weavers that dot them.
And if all you’re looking for is a cheap, $2-per-student thrill in this spooky season, that skittering tarantula is more than happy to oblige.

What’s for dinner?
It’s a question that’s perplexed mankind on a daily basis since the beginning of time.
Unfortunately, if you’re a USC student, the correct answer is “nothing on campus during the weekends” ­— unless you’re lucky enough to have a meal plan for either of the decadent dining halls on campus.
Thomas Curry | Daily Trojan
Currently, all specialty cafes as well as restaurants in The Lot and Café 84 are closed on the weekends, save for Baja Fresh and The Lab. Further, most USC restaurants — especially those in The Lot — have shortened hours of operation during the week, cutting service times from anywhere between one and eight hours.
Apocalyptic? Hardly.
Inconvenient? Absolutely.
In anticipation of the opening of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center in the Fall 2010 semester, and the likely closing of the church bazaar tent it will be replacing, Trojan Hospitality has been working with the Undergraduate Student Government to survey the dining preferences of the student body.
The survey for prospective Campus Center residents reads like a who’s who of heavy hitters in the greasy food industry. Carl’s Jr., Wolfgang Puck, Panda Express, California Pizza Kitchen, Chick-fil-A and Five Guys are the most notable inclusions in this all-star team of culinary choices.
Great.
Don’t get me wrong — as an East-Coaster, the prospect of being able to cross-pollinate and wash down a side of Five Guys’ Cajun fries with a Chick-fil-A peach milkshake excites me just as much as the next J. Crew-clad student.
But even if the university finds some way of acquiring the 10 most highly rated establishments on the Zagat survey and throwing them into the Campus Center, it seems that the quality of venues would only slightly outweigh the quantity of hours — or lack thereof — that these restaurants were open. Meaning, even though The Lot might be gone by the time the Tutor Center opens its doors, the inconvenient hours of operation will likely endure through the opening of the new campus center and its dining facilities.
It’s like owning a fleet of BMWs, but only being able to open the doors during certain times. The car may run better than any car you’ve ever driven, but it’s a moot point if you can’t use it whenever you need to.
The campus already boasts a fair share of high-quality retail outlets. The solution is not to switch out your car for another comparable luxury vehicle with the same problem, but to find a way to fix what you’ve already got — improving the service of current facilities and curbing the ambitious dreams of a high-profile and high-cost cast of food court companions.
Granted, there is an abundance of non-Trojan Hospitality dining locations around campus, which will only grow with the completion of the new housing complex on the corner of Jefferson Boulevard and Figueroa Street. Healthy options on Figueroa are scarce, however, leaving students to choose between greasy drive-throughs at 2 a.m. Also, for those who depend on university financial aid to defer food costs, or those whose parents would be much more inclined to provide discretionary/dining funds over straight-cash-homie, the convenience of having on-campus retail dining available daily is immense.
Trojan Hospitality has done a great job in providing the student body with new options in recent years, with the opening of The Lab, Rosso’s and McKay’s. But the next, and more important, step is to provide students with full days of service at some venues. The buildings that house these dining establishments are already built, or in the process of being built. Even in the aftermath of an economic downturn, would furnishing an extra 20 hours of wages for all willing food vendors really take that big a bite out of the budget?
Odds are, probably not, especially if there’s a strong showing of hungry undergrads coming to get their Tutor on every weekend.
Adding in fresh new options to the Campus Center’s arsenal of dining venues is an appetizing prospect. In a perfect world, we would be able to have our individually packaged fast-food cake and eat it seven days a week. But realistically, if substituting in a lesser quality franchise or even one fewer restaurant in the new student center would allow for hours that extended into the weekend and lengthened the “normal” weekday hours, it would make sense for the USG and Trojan Hospitality to sink their teeth into such a proposal.

Even though 10 a.m. is way too early to be eating hot dogs, loyal fans fire up barbecue grills in the parking lot. Children toss footballs on the lawn. True devotees don jerseys with their beloved colors, and some even paint those hues on their flabby stomachs — to the horror of the general public. It is game day in Los Angeles, but this time, it’s not the Trojans who will be taking the field.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger should be commended for signing a bill last Thursday to accelerate construction for an NFL stadium 15 miles east of Downtown Los Angeles in the City of Industry. While it does not guarantee that the stadium will be built — an NFL owner must first agree to bring a team to Los Angeles — approving plans for the stadium was certainly the biggest hurdle yet to be crossed.
Soon, USC students may have yet another team to root for, and even more game days to celebrate.
There are many concerns about the environmental damage and increased traffic a football stadium will cause; others question the need for a professional football team in a city that two popular college teams already call home.
Despite these worries, USC students and Los Angeles residents alike have many reasons to be enthusiastic about the invitation Schwarzenegger has extended to bring professional football back to Los Angeles.
One way this will create a positive impact on our community is that the stadium will create about 18,000 jobs, said USC Trustee Edward Roski Jr. in an interview with the Los Angeles Times.
Roski is the real estate developer who will build the $800-million stadium near the junction of the 57 and 60 freeways. He and officials from Majestic Realty Co., where he is CEO, have lobbied relentlessly this year to pass laws and get the project in motion.
Building a football stadium could boost California’s slumping economy by requiring a huge workforce to construct the 75,000-seat venue.
Timing for this project is perfect: California’s unemployment rate continues to soar, reaching 12.2 percent in September.
Schwarzenegger promised profits as well, assuring that the project is expected to boost the local economy by more than $760 million in revenue annually.
In addition to the stadium, the site will include an orthopedic hospital, a movie theater, restaurants, office space and retail stores.
This bodes well for job-seeking USC students, who may find employment at the stadium in departments like marketing and sports medicine.
Another benefit of having professional football so close to our home base is that it will provide another source of lucrative entertainment in our city. A potential LA Superbowl could bring in up to $800 million in revenue, not to mention weekly games.
For those who fear traffic jams and added noise, Roski and his developers have ensured that the arena would be capped at 45 events a year — which would end by 10 p.m. to limit late-night disturbances for nearby residents, like those in Walnut who vehemently oppose the stadium.
Roski’s project will also give Los Angeles the opportunity to pioneer what Schwarzenegger called “the nation’s greenest football stadium.” Although last Thursday’s bill designed to speed up construction has made the building exempt from state environmental laws, the stadium will be the first to earn certification from the US Green Building Council, as it will be powered by solar panels and use recycled water.
Finally, welcoming a professional football team back to Los Angeles provides a unique platform upon which our city can build unity. Successful teams like the Lakers and Dodgers have proven that sports can boost pride for our community despite a rattled economy. Maybe a winning football team can do the same.
After the Super Bowl is played in February, Roski has said he will approach seven teams whose present contracts, audience markets and finances are less than ideal to discuss the option of moving to Los Angeles: the San Diego Chargers, Oakland Raiders, San Francisco 49ers, Buffalo Bills, Jacksonville Jaguars, Minnesota Vikings and St. Louis Rams.
As soon as a team is locked in, Roski will break ground on the project’s construction. In the meantime, California officials and residents alike will have to wait in eager anticipation, hoping the USC trustee can “Fight On” and help bring professional football back to Los Angeles.

I think that building a Stadium in L.A is a great idea. It will also definetly create more jobs for our public who is very desperate for any job openings. This mighty also bring more tourists to California, which can help raise this state’s economy.

Looking for an on-campus part-time job with flexible hours and underwear-cleaning duties? If you went to Georgetown, you’d be in luck!
In our nation’s capital, students don’t have to wait to graduate from college before becoming a self-important pricks that need personal assistants— they can start right now. And they’re hiring wannabe-sycophants with a tendency towards masochism.
According to the Georgetown Voice blog, a Georgetown sophomore posted a job listing on the Student Employment Office website offering $12/hour for a student willing to do tasks like:
Organize closet -make bed -Drop off / pick up dry cleaning -Drop me off / pick me up from work -Do laundry -Fill up gas tank -bring car for servicing -schedule appointment for haircut -Pay parking tickets -manage electronic accounts -shopping and running errands -other random tasks.
It’s the opportunity of a life time, to be sure. Why do grunt work as an intern at a corporation when you can be humiliated at the hands of a fellow student?
And watch out, although he offers the opportunity to earn bonuses, he’s stingy with his hours:
Tasks such as doing laundry that involve a lot of waiting around (time when you could be doing other tasks or doing your own stuff) will be counted for the approximate amount of time it would take to do the labor involved. For instance, laundry will be counted for half an hour even though a laundry cycle takes 1.5 hrs to complete.


Makes you appreciate your your part-time job as a book organizer at Gerontology Library, doesn’t it?
