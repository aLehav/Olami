Laura Janke, the former USC assistant soccer coach who fabricated athletic profiles to facilitate the acceptance of children of wealthy parents in exchange for bribes as part of “Operation Varsity Blues,” was sentenced to time served with one year of supervised release and 50 hours of community service Tuesday. Ali Khosroshahin, a former USC soccer coach who hired Janke and also accepted bribes in exchange for falsified recruiting, was sentenced to six months of home confinement Wednesday.
A Los Angeles couple, Davina and Bruce Isackson, who paid $600,000 to admit their daughters to USC and UCLA as bogus athletic recruits, also avoided jail time and were both sentenced to time served, one year of probation and fines Tuesday.
Janke, who was dismissed from USC in 2014, pleaded guilty to a racketeering conspiracy as part of admissions consultant turned bribery scheme mastermind William “Rick” Singer’s college admissions scheme in May 2019. 
Following her March 2019 arrest, Janke agreed to cooperate with the federal investigation into the scandal in April of the same year, providing “substantial assistance in the government’s investigation and prosecution of others,” the government’s sentencing memorandum reads. Janke’s testimony in two trials resulted in the conviction of parents Gamal Abdelaziz and John Wilson and former women’s water polo coach Jovan Vavic. Court documents from Janke’s sentencing reveal that she displayed “genuine remorse” for her actions throughout the course of the proceedings. 
Khosroshahin, who worked as the USC women’s soccer head coach from 2007 to 2013, hired Janke in 2007 to serve as assistant coach to his team. The two were previously acquainted — Khosroshahin recruited and coached Janke as a soccer player at Cal State-Fullerton. According to court documents, Khosroshahin informed Janke of the scheme and solicited her help in admitting bribe-paying applicants as fake soccer recruits. 
Khosroshahin, who prosecutors said initially “expressed reticence” at Singer’s proposal for the scheme, worked with Janke to submit deceitful athletic profiles — some created by Singer, some by Khosroshahin and Janke themselves — to the University’s subcommittee on athletic admissions. The former coaches accepted one or two of Singer’s applicants per year while receiving Singer’s payments to the USC soccer program and later to their private soccer club. 
Janke must forfeit $129,213.90 in ill-gotten gains from bribery payments — the sum was transferred from her and Khosroshahim’s private soccer club to Janke personally after October 2012.
Khosroshahim pleaded guilty in 2019 to assisting Singer in conducting “side door” admission to USC and has cooperated with authorities investigating the scandal, ESPN reported. Though prosecutors in Khosroshahin’s case had not been seeking home confinement or prison time for him, United States District Judge Indira Talwani believed prosecutors’ sentencing recommendations to be insufficient. 
Davina, fined $1,000, and Bruce, fined $7,500, used Singer’s connections and scheme to facilitate the admission of one of their daughters as a bogus soccer recruit and the other as a crew recruit to USC and UCLA. In May 2019, the pair pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.
Bruce’s attorney wrote in a sentencing memorandum that Bruce cooperated with the federal investigation over the course of three years, sitting for government interviews, providing documents and testifying in two trials. 
“All told, Mr. Isackson’s cooperation was a significant factor in the successful prosecution of almost 40 other defendants,” the document reads.
Davina, too, was one of the first parents in the case to plead guilty and announced publicly her cooperation in the investigation within a month of her arrest in March 2019, court documents show. The three-year pre-trial supervision period Davina served was decided to be sufficient time served.
“She has spent more than three years as the subject of public ridicule and humiliation, including facing her own children’s anger at her,” Davina’s attorney said in her sentencing memorandum.
UCLA issued a letter June 13 regarding the matter of the Isacksons, writing that their wrongdoing deprived the university system of the ability to allocate highly desired spots on the school’s intercollegiate varsity sports teams to truly deserving student-athletes. 
“The conduct of Bruce and Davina Isackson struck at the integrity of UC’s merit-based admissions process and the interests of the University and the public it serves,” the letter read. 
Janke’s attorney declined the Daily Trojan’s request for comment. Attorneys for Davina and Bruce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Sparks have so much to believe in. 
First and foremost, they have a fresh start at the very top. Following the firing of former Head Coach and General Manager Derek Fisher, they named a new coach who has many qualities that Fisher lacked. Interim Head Coach Fred Williams has extensive coaching experience at multiple levels, including coaching at USC and for other WNBA teams. He is also held in high regard by two of his most important players, Nneka Ogwumike and Liz Cambage. While Fisher was known for letting beloved superstars go under his tenure, Williams has earned the respect that might inspire the current superstars to stay. 
Williams has the credibility and likability of a good leader. His Sparks need to believe in that. 
On the players’ side, forward Katie Lou Samuelson is playing the best season of her career. In the Sparks’ most recent win, a solid victory over the star-studded Seattle Storm, she played the entire game save for one minute and scored 17 key points. She’s averaging 10.7 points per game, easily her career best. Additionally, she is shooting the lights out— she’s averaging 46% from the 3-point range, an elite clip. 
Samuelson’s skills and numbers are impressive, but what is even more impressive is her growth into a key starter for her team. Her teammates need to believe in that, and push her even more to grow into a star. 
The Sparks also have some of the most talented defenders in the league. Ogwumike and Brittney Sykes are elite on-ball defenders and are both among the league leaders in steals per game, with Sykes leading the league at 2.2 per game. Not to be outdone, Cambage ranks third in the league in blocks per game. 
And of course, they have the W’s best defensive coach, Latricia Trammell, who has built a reputation for being the source of the Sparks’ defensive success from 2019 to 2021. Except, they don’t have much to show for it this season beyond individual numbers. The Sparks have the third worst defensive rating in the WNBA so far in 2022 and have lost six games by 10 or more points. 
With so much elite defensive talent, the Sparks should be near the top in defensive success. They need to believe in themselves and one another and start playing as a smarter, more aggressive, and especially more confident, defensive unit. 
But defense is just the start of the Sparks’ woes this season.
Cambage, who has at times been compared to Shaq, should be dominating games. However, the center isn’t scoring, and instead is spending most of her time on the bench. She needs to remind herself, her teammates and her coaches who she is. To do that, she needs to impose her will by believing she is in command of the game and acting like it. 
In contrast, rookie Olivia Nelson-Ododa is playing key minutes like a seasoned veteran despite her inexperience. The Sparks need to believe that she’s ready for more and increase her minutes per game. 
In general, the Sparks need to believe in the depth of their roster. Everyone on the roster has proved they can contribute meaningful game minutes. When a regular rotation player is struggling, the Sparks need to believe in their bench. 
This column sort of reads like a pep talk. That’s probably because when I sit on my couch watching the games, that’s what I feel they need the most. 
The Sparks have the talent. They have shown they can beat the best, as they have beaten three out of the five WNBA teams over .500 to date. They have the opportunity of a fresh start with a reputable coach, which provides an opportunity to forget about the slow start and mentally reset the season. 
It all comes down to one thing: the Sparks just need to believe. 
On some nights, the Sparks look like an elite team. On others, they look like they forgot who they are. Los Angeles sits at tenth in league standings. If the season ended today, the Sparks would miss the playoffs. However, if their dynamic group of playmakers lives up to their potential, the Sparks can climb the WNBA standings and have a shot at a title. 
My hope for the rest of the season is that they find that belief and realize who they can become if they pull it together. I want to be watching my first WNBA Finals in September, and if the Sparks are in it, you better believe I’m going to try to show up to Crypto.com Arena to cheer my team toward a title. 
I hope to see some of you there.

Women’s soccer released the 2022 season schedule Tuesday, consisting of 17 regular season games after an opening exhibition game against Pepperdine on August 11. The Trojans had a memorable 2021 season, in which they managed a 15-game unbeaten run en route to a second-place finish in the Pac-12 and a second-round appearance in the NCAA tournament under former Head Coach Keidane McAlpine’s stewardship. 
New Head Coach Jane Alukonis was named to take over following McAlpine’s departure to the University of Georgia after eight seasons with the Trojans, during which USC never missed the postseason. With all-time leading goalscorer Penelope Hocking’s recent transfer to Penn State and Savannah DeMelo’s introduction to the National Women’s Soccer League, Alukonis will need to revitalize USC’s offense. 
Alukonis’ coaching staff includes former USWNT player Amy Rodriguez, who retired after 11 professional seasons. She is a former All-American, two-time gold medalist and World Cup winner. 
“I’m absolutely thrilled to have [Rodriguez] on the coaching staff,” said Alukonis in an interview with USC Athletics. “I can’t wait to see her push the players to their max on a daily basis. She is the perfect coach and mentor to help USC players achieve their big dreams.”
Alukonis also added former Arizona State Assistant Coach Shigeyoshi “Sugar” Shinohara to her coaching staff, who helped guide the Sun Devils to their first postseason appearance since 2014 during the 2020 campaign. 
“I couldn’t be more grateful to have Shigeyoshi ‘Sugar’ Shinohara join our coaching staff,”  Alukonis said. “Sugar is a teacher at heart, super intelligent, and has an especially enthusiastic and positive coaching demeanor.” 
Alukonis also added former World Cup winner Saskia Webber, who worked with Alukonis for two seasons as UCLA’s goalkeeper coach, to her staff.
“I am so grateful to have Saskia on staff here at USC,” Alukonis said. “She is able to bring the best out of goalkeepers through her high-energy and inspiring coaching style. Saskia will be a wonderful mentor not only to the goalkeepers, but to the entire team.”
Under Alukonis’ tenure as an assistant coach, UCLA never finished lower than second in the conference standings and made four straight NCAA postseason appearances. The former Duke player was part of the Pacific Region Coaching Staff of the Year during the 2020 season, and will now have a chance to lead a program for the first time in her career. 
Senior midfielder Croix Bethune played as a makeshift forward under McAlpine’s historical system last season, which saw the longest unbeaten streak in program history. In 20 total appearances, Bethune managed 16 goals and led the Pac-12 with 10 assists. With Hocking and DeMelo’s departure, Bethune will need to retain her scoring and playmaking ability. Bethune was named as last year’s Pac-12 Midfielder of the Year and earned All-Pac-12 first team honors. 
Sophomore forward Simone Jackson managed 5 goals and 8 assists in 20 total appearances, starting eight games. After showing promise during her freshman season, Jackson will have an opportunity this season to provide more fruitful contributions. Jackson earned both All-Pac-12 second team and All-Freshman team honors. 
Sophomore midfielders Simi Awujo and Aaliyah Farmer constructed a formidable partnership as holding midfielders in front of McAlpine’s defense, earning All-Freshman honors. Junior fullback Zoe Burns and sophomore defender Brooklyn Courtnall were instrumental in McAlpine’s defensive line, both contributing to seven total clean sheets. Burns earned All-Pac-12 second team recognition and Courtnall earned All-Pac-12 third team honors, as well as All-Freshman honors. 
The Trojans narrowly missed the Pac-12 title after losing against crosstown rivals UCLA in the last match of the regular season. USC subsequently defeated Grand Canyon in the first round of the NCAA Tournament before losing to Penn State in a dreaded penalty shoot-out after drawing with a 2-2 scoreline during regulation time. 
USC will face off against Texas Christian University this season, who finished as a fourth seed last campaign and managed a third-round appearance in the NCAA Tournament before falling to Rutgers. The Trojans will face Nebraska in an away bout in their first visit to Lincoln since 1997.  
USC’s first Pac-12 match will be a home showdown against Stanford, a team that was a Pac-12 title contender over the course of last season. The Trojans overcame a 2-0 deficit against Stanford in the penultimate match of the season, with goals from Jackson and Bethune, and finished the bout with a 3-2 victory. 
The Trojans will host both Washington and Washington State, two teams that etched out draws against USC in the away fixtures last season, before hosting UCLA in what will likely be another profound rivalry showdown on the last matchday of the 2022 season. 
USC will open the regular season with an away game against Purdue on August 18.

If I had a dollar for every time the girl ends up with the wrong guy in any movie, book or TV show, I would be richer than Jeff Bezos. No, seriously.
From Darcy to Heathcliff in books to Edward and Damon in entertainment, why is it that our heroines always go for the brooding, moody, more complicated choice for partners when there are perfectly more apt and “ready to give you the world” options right by your side already?
Maybe we’re all masochists and think we can “fix” the mysterious bad boy, but doesn’t that just get tiring? As I’ve gotten older and lived through my fair share of brooding boys, I realized that the less appealing type of love — a compatible and safe one — is often overlooked in real life, and I ask myself why. Well, maybe it’s a result of all forms of popular media showing us that this type of love isn’t enough, and that we should opt for a more complicated romance, one that will surely leave one tired and overwhelmed with exhaustion. 
The most recent example of this? Amazon Prime’s new original series, “The Summer I Turned Pretty.” 
Adapted from Jenny Han’s trilogy, “The Summer I Turned Pretty” follows a young Isabel (Belly) as she enjoys her summer in Cousins Beach with her brother and two close friends, Conrad and Jeremiah. As the title suggests, this particular summer was a change for Belly as she turned 16 and began getting noticed by boys, Conrad and Jeremiah included. 
Belly has been in love with Conrad since they were kids, but Conrad had seemingly not reciprocated those feelings. On the other hand, Jeremiah had feelings for Belly but did not tell her until that summer and upon his confession, she began to reciprocate. Complicated, I know, especially since the two are brothers. 
Although I am a big fan of the books, it is the show that has gained traction on social media, especially on TikTok, with thousands of videos talking about the long-standing battle between boys. We saw this with Team Jacob versus Team Edward, Team Stefan versus Team Damon and Team Peeta versus Team Gale — now, it’s Team Jere versus Team Conrad. 
Spoiler alert: she picks Conrad. The thing about Conrad is that he — in the books more so than the show — has always been kind of a jerk to Belly, especially that summer, making fun of her for having a boyfriend, growing up and wanting to be a debutante. I will say that much of this pent-up anger that Conrad possesses is because his mother is dying of cancer but even then, when Jere found out about his mom’s cancer, he never acted the way Conrad did, especially with Belly. 
Yet, the Team Conrad boat has taken afloat and carried all the seemingly sensible women with it. Partly to blame is Taylor Swift — let me explain. 
In the show, when Conrad saves the day and dances with Belly, Swift’s song, “The Way I Loved You,” plays in the background, reinforcing the idea that a love where you are “screaming and crying” is better than a “sensible” love. Now, Dr. Swift has had her fair share of unsensible loves, writing about them in songs like “All Too Well” with lyrics like, “Did the twin flame bruise maim you too?” 
Now that she is in a more sensible, steady relationship with Joe Alwyn, you would think Swift would have dedicated “This Love (Taylor’s Version)” to a similar love affair between Jere and Belly, but instead Dr. Swift is Team Conrad. 
And that’s the mystery of the brooding bad boy — he makes the most sensible women drop to her knees and fall head over heels even when a better, more steady choice is right there, waiting for you. 
Needless to say, I will die on the boat of team Jeremiah knowing I have resisted the temptation and spell of all the “Conrads” on the island and made the right choice.

I want to preface this review with a couple of notes. One: I am an Annenberg student, not an SCA student, and I know absolutely nothing about academic film theory. Two: I love Elvis. One of my most prized possessions happens to be a genuine 1977 photograph of his grave that I found behind an antique store shelf. As I type it out now it seems like a very morbid confession, but I purchased it in good faith, I promise. And three: The cost of the ticket to see this movie was the same as the amount I’m getting paid for this review, so I’m basically doing this pro bono. 
With all of that being said, I will do my best in bringing forth an objective review of this summer’s hottest biopic. 
To pregame my viewing of “Elvis” this weekend, I went to Vegas for two days and listened to Phoebe Bridgers’ “Graceland Too” aplenty. Yet I was still unprepared. The first few minutes of the newest Elvis Presley biopic made me feel as if I accidentally missed my theater number and sat down in a virtual roller coaster simulator. Much like the stage outfits worn by Presley, the film’s cinematography was flashy, oversaturated and, perhaps, should have come with a motion sickness warning. 
Austin Butler (of “Sharpay’s Fabulous Adventure” and “Aliens in the Attic” fame) plays The King this time around and puts every other Elvis impersonator to shame. Instead of treating the role as a cheesy act, as so many Vegas-based mimics have, Butler makes this look like the most brutal workout regime of his life, as much of his screen time is devoted to onstage performances where he is expected to perform otherworldly moves. His sex symbol status just adds to the intensity of his choreography, as he woos everyone in his audiences with his eyeliner and hip-thrust combo. In short, before women were throwing their bras to A$AP Rocky on stage, they were throwing their underwear to Elvis. 
Yet it is Elvis’ role as a sex bomb entertainer that takes away from his humanity, a side of the superstar that audiences expected to be covered in this film. With Elvis’ manager, Col. Tom Parker (Tom Hanks) as narrator of the story, Presley feels more like a phenomenon than a human. Major parts of Presley’s personal life — including his relationships, substance abuse and health problems — are noticeably minimized in favor of focusing on the toxic and draining relationship between the star and his longtime manager. 
While it is an unexpected choice of narrative focus, Luhrmann’s intentions shine through. Instead of being a painstakingly detailed biography of the late legend, he instead attempts to illustrate the dangers and exploitative nature of the entertainment industry and how easily genuine talents and cultural phenomena can be snuffed out by greed. Still, the emphasis on Parker (and Hanks’ fatsuit) detracts from what the audience came to see: the King himself. 
Luhrmann also spends significant portions of the film demonstrating just how much influence Black culture had on Elvis’ career, illustrating that the star wouldn’t be nearly as bright without gospel,rhythm and blues. Beale Street is just as much a character in this film as anyone else, portrayed through R&B titans B.B. King (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) and Big Mama Thornton (Shonka Dukureh) who serve as Presley’s main source of inspiration.
The film’s soundtrack sees modern hip-hop intertwined with Elvis’ biggest hits, featuring the likes of Doja Cat, Denzel Curry and Nardo Wick. There’s also a mashup featuring Britney Spears’s “Toxic” and the Backstreet Boys’ “Everybody” that left me floored.
With so many elements spanning Elvis’s entire lifetime interwoven into one 159-minute feature, it’s easy for the film to seem dizzying. And Luhrmann welcomes it, interchanging appearances and moods at the blink of an eye. The film reveals many darker sides to Presley, as well as emotionally poignant moments (a group of older women in my row at the theater shed some tears). 
In short, this is more of a visual contribution to Elvis’ larger-than-life legacy than a completely historically accurate one. But this might be expected, considering that Luhrmann’s style relies on maximalism, not accuracy. The narrative can be wishy-washy, and the over-the-top edits, cuts, and musical numbers can be jarring. Yet it is more than worth the watch, and definitely one of the must-see movies of this year. Even if Austin Butler egregiously smolders every single time he’s onscreen.

Rick Riordan’s hit book series, “Percy Jackson and the Olympians” is currently in the process of being adapted into a new Disney+ television series. I never thought we, Riordan fans, would be graced with a show. I always assumed the tragic movies were all we would get. 
So with the cast of the upcoming “Percy Jackson and the Olympians” series officially announced, I had the perfect excuse to reread the series. When I enter a reading slump, I often consider returning to childhood favorites to try and get myself back in the habit of reading slowly without pushing myself with difficult language and complicated symbolism. 
However, revisiting nostalgic classics comes with its own problems. I tend to romanticize my childhood books, choosing to remember them as faultless, page-turning masterworks. When in reality, they are often far from that. Every once in a while I pick up my yellowing copies of the “Harry Potter” series, expecting to experience the same joy I felt when I first immersed myself in the wizarding world in second grade. I was obsessed to such a degree that I was eventually banned from bringing the novels to school as they would distract me from my other work. Still, I find myself done with the series after “Chamber of Secrets.” The reason is a mix of boredom and the devastating reminder of J.K. Rowling’s villain arc. So as much as I try to preserve my childhood glee associated with “Harry Potter,” it is now undeniable to me that the books are simply not the best.
Therefore, I was slightly terrified to even touch my “Percy Jackson” collection. I held such fantastic memories of the books that I was worried that rereading might sully the perfect image I held in my mind. Much to my delight, the books are just as good as I remembered — or maybe even better than I thought. Especially now that I’m able to compare the series to better books than Heather Vogel Frederick’s “The Mother-Daughter Book Club” series. Now, those are books that I am actually too scared to even entertain the idea of revisiting.
I have very few, actual memories of the “Book Club” series besides it inspiring my love of Jane Austen and some random side-villain named Stinkerbelle. However, I plan to continue the rest of my life believing they were literary masterpieces and hope to never be proven wrong. On my deathbed, I will remember Stinkerbelle as the singlemost significant foe ever introduced to the world. 
It is with rereads that the faults of the novels begin to reveal themselves between seemingly perfect lines. Whether due to boring characters or inconsistent plot details, books can quickly fall from their pedestal: Did Fred and/or George really never question why they never met a Peter Pettigrew that their little brother seemed to hang out with every night? 
Although, I will admit that after actually learning about Greek and Roman mythology and reading poems like Ovid’s “Metamorphoses,” Riordan’s mentions of the gods’ crimes concerned me more than they did when I was nine and pretended to be sick so I could read the recently released “Mark of Athena” (Sorry, mom! It was important!). For example, during my rereading, Apollo’s appearances reminded me less of the sweet romance between Will and Nico and more of the story of Daphne — a story in which Apollo chases a woman for so long, her only way to escape from his advances is by metamorphosing from a young, free woman to an olive tree. This story is not even close to the worst godly crimes. It of course makes sense not to go into detail in a children’s book, but knowing more of the story certainly makes me understand Luke better. 
Still, the five books of “Percy Jackson’’ kept me involved, both mentally and emotionally, throughout it all. I fell back in love with the characters and the camp. Without ever getting too difficult to handle, the books include important topics for all ages including learning differences and grief. The series also included some of the first LGBTQIA+ identities I ever encountered in children’s literature and remains prevalent to this day with over 180 million copies sold. The series is not just a good read, but its impact cannot be denied either. 
At the end of the day, the most important thing to remember regarding “Percy Jackson” is that Leo Valdez is the greatest character of all time (excluding Stinkerbelle, of course).

Lucy Westlake sought to achieve something only 4,000 people have ever accomplished: summiting Mount Everest. On May 12, Lucy, an incoming freshman majoring in public policy and distance runner for the USC Track & Field team, became the youngest American woman to complete the highest climb on Earth. 
Lucy, born in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and residing in Naperville, Ill., began climbing at the age of seven after her family stumbled upon Black Mountain in Kentucky while traveling. After that first climb, Lucy fell in love with finding the highest mountains and climbing them. 
“It became me and my dad’s kind of thing or adventure,” said Lucy in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We would go off and the mountain just kept getting bigger and bigger, and we kept getting more into it.” 
Rodney Westlake, Lucy’s dad, said that from the time she was three years old, the two of them would climb small mountains together around Michigan. After climbing for years, Rodney knew that the sport was growing on both of them. 
“Once we started to dip our toes in this climbing mountain world, it just sort of grew from there,” Rodney said. “It wasn’t anything anybody planned, certainly not what I planned.”
After years of climbing with her dad, Lucy decided to take on the Explorer’s Grand Slam as a greater goal of hers. The challenge dares participants to climb and reach the North Pole, the South Pole and all of the Seven Summits, one on each continent. Lucy decided that as a part of that challenge, she would climb Mount Everest — the highest mountain on Earth above sea level, standing at 29,053 feet between Nepal and Tibet — at the age of 18.
“[Everest] didn’t even come into our minds until Lucy and I summited Aconcagua [in South America] in January,” Rodney said. 
After receiving a $12,500 scholarship to climb Everest, Rodney saw the climb coming to fruition. 
Lucy graduated from high school a semester early to travel to Kenya and Uganda to work on water filtration projects. While there, she ran with Olympic runners from Kenya, which served as training for her to both join USC’s track team and to summit Everest. However, Lucy and her family weren’t sure the climb would happen, as the scholarship only covered a portion of the ascent.
“Most Western climbers use two Sherpas, which gives them the flexibility to have the climber carry very little weight,” said Rodney, referring to the potential price increase for the Everest climb associated with having two Sherpas, professional guides who navigate and help with gear during the climb. “We just knew Lucy was very strong, so she was just up there with one Sherpa.”
Lucy’s dream of climbing Everest became a reality in May and she enjoyed every second of the experience. 
“I was just so so excited. It was an absolutely amazing experience and definitely did not disappoint at all,” Lucy said. 
After 25 days of climbing up the mountain, Lucy made it to the top of Everest, which she said “felt surreal.” 
“I was like, ‘Wow, I did it,”’ Lucy said. “I was just really proud of myself and I was thinking about how proud my family and friends would be of me, especially my family, who invested so much in me.” 
When Lucy’s parents found out she reached the summit, they both burst into a dance of excitement, according to Rodney. 
“She did it alone, which is unique. Most people are a part of a team,” Rodney said. “When she summited, it was a relief, like complete and total joy.” 
As the youngest woman to climb Everest among other achievements — including being the youngest female to reach the summit of all 50 U.S. state highpoints — Lucy said she hopes to be an inspiration to aspiring climbers, especially women, since the sport remains male-dominated. Lucy is partnering with AWExpeditions, an organization that organizes mountaineering trips for women, to create a summit scholarship in her name that will support girls and young women who wish to start climbing.
“I’m a small, young girl, and I don’t see anyone else like me in the mountains,” Lucy said. “It’d be great to see more of that in the future, and I really hope that can happen.” 
Dan Iverson, Lucy’s high school track & field coach, describes her as a “tremendous interpersonal leader” — Lucy also engages in public and motivational speaking in her free time from mountaineering. Iverson said he’s proud to have coached Lucy, who he said possesses a level of talent that he hasn’t seen in a long time.
“I don’t know that many people are going to be able to follow in her shoes. I don’t think we’re going to have very many people that rush up Everest,” Iverson said. “The message that the rest of our team has gotten from her is that there’s not just one path that makes things right. You can do a lot of different things and can pursue passions in a bunch of different ways.”
Lucy said she’s excited to begin her college career as a Trojan in the fall and hopes to continue working toward completing the Explorer’s Grand Slam. With Antarctica, Australia and the North and South Poles left in the challenge for her, Lucy aims to complete the roster of peaks throughout this upcoming year while focusing on running and exploring how far she can go. But for now, Lucy is mainly set on her future at USC.
“I’m really most excited about the team atmosphere and the Trojan family,” Lucy said. “I got to meet some of the girls last year and they’re really sweet. I really liked them and coach [Jebreh] Harris, I’m really excited to work with him. He seems like an amazing coach and person. So that’s definitely what I’m most excited about.”

A gift to the Keck School of Medicine from the W.M. Keck Foundation is helping fund researchers conducting studies to further the medical field’s understanding of the coronavirus. The school has since awarded a total of more than $5 million to 28 various research applications from the USC COVID-19 Research Fund. These studies aim to advance scientific research and public health collaborations on the coronavirus.
“The Keck Foundation made a very wise and fruitful decision to give money to the Keck School of Medicine to do many things around COVID-19,” said Dr. Thomas A. Buchanan, vice dean of research and professor of medicine at Keck. “[The donation is meant] to help us be set up to do research more effectively, to help with some of our basic sciences, actually do research that lead to possible new treatments for COVID-19 and to do a lot with the communities.”
The majority of the research fund has been put toward community research studies, with a total of 13 funded projects that study the impact of the coronavirus on communities in a variety of areas, including vaccination, food security and home acceptance. 
Eight preclinical and four clinical research study grants were provided as well. Preclinical research studies are expected to study the biology of the coronavirus in relation to potential new treatments, while clinical research studies relate to particular preclinical research to support outcomes of that research as well as possible treatments. 
The remaining three funded grants were put toward expanding shareable resources, one of which is a biosafety level three lab. The funding for the facility enabled researchers to study highly infectious viruses. Earlier on during the pandemic, Keck invested in equipment for the lab and in helping the researchers secure coronavirus particles in animal models, from which they can study the virus. 
“The facility allows the researchers to order tests and use live viruses,” said Dr. Amy Lee, a professor of biochemistry and molecular medicine and the Judy and Larry Freeman Chair in Basic Science Cancer Research. “You can really study the effect of your project using live viruses in a very safe environment. Without this funding, this would not be possible.” 
Lee’s research — combating the coronavirus infection through targeting cell surface GRP78 with monoclonal antibody MAb159 — was one of the 28 research studies funded through the research grant program. The project aims to discover new targets and therapeutic ways to mitigate the coronavirus pandemic.
Other shareable resources funding went toward starting a biorepository, as well as the Population Health Sciences COVID-19 Pandemic Research Center. The CPRC promotes research in different areas of study to help better understand and alleviate the impact of the  coronavirus on residents of the Los Angeles area.  The program also initiated a partnership between the University and the L.A. County Department of Public Health to work together on studying the coronavirus in addition to other viral infections. 
The research fund has been able to easily provide grant money to research study applications, Lee said. 
“This money is invariable in the sense that because the application process is very streamlined, we can get an answer, ‘yes’ or ‘no,’ in a very fast manner,” Lee said. “It allows us to carry out the research without much delay because, usually, applying for grant funding takes a long time. This is a very efficiently run program with the resources available right away.”

With inflation rising at a rate not seen since the 1970s, the United States is experiencing price increases on a dwindling supply of products, average gas prices soaring above $5 a gallon and a decrease in home affordability pushing more residents out of the housing market — with the possibility of an impending recession lingering in experts’ minds. In the Los Angeles area, the Consumer Price Index rose 0.8% in the month of May alone, a trend affecting the USC community in a myriad of ways.
The causes of the current economic state are not the same as past periods of uncertainty. According to Rodney Ramcharan, a professor of finance and business economics, the pandemic created a supply-side shock on goods coming from Asian countries that recently put lockdowns on production, as well as an increase in demand for these products in the U.S., motivated by the Federal Reserve’s stimulus. The plausibility of curbing such fast-growing rates, Ramcharan said, is an uncertain game. 
“There are still bottlenecks in the supply chain, so it’s very difficult to see when the inflation rate will come down,” Ramcharan said. “With that being said, it’s unlikely that this will go on for the next five years. It’s much more likely that this will become much more contained within the next six months to the next year.”
Students have also noticed these unique inflationary conditions manifesting in the prices they pay for common goods, including Kenny Nguyen, a rising sophomore majoring in computer science, who observed prices going up for a variety of products he regularly buys, ranging from cans of Arizona tea to a full tank of gas for his car.
Nguyen said seeing usual product prices becoming steeper made him feel uncomfortable against his unchanged pay.
“I’m not making any more money. I’m still getting paid $15.50 [an hour], and my wages aren’t going up,” Nguyen said. “But now things are getting more expensive, so it seems slightly unfair.”
The pandemic’s effects on the housing market strike a similar chord, with less houses being available for sale and rent — with a housing supply about half the size it was before the pandemic — and more individuals emerging to make such an investment.
The most prominent area of price inflation in the current housing market is with rents, said Gary Painter, a professor of public policy and director of the Homelessness Policy Research Institute. During the pandemic, rent prices fell for the first time in 10 years, including in and around the USC area, as more students and other University community members lived away from campus, which decreased demand for housing near campus and across the U.S. 
In the current phase of looser restrictions on life and the market, available homes for rent or purchase cannot meet the rate of population growth, especially in the state of California, Painter said.
“We just simply have to make it easier to build housing of all types: housing that’s aimed at people who have moderate income, people who have low income and people who have upper middle class incomes,” said Painter on California’s housing market. “We just simply haven’t built enough housing of any type.”
According to Painter, doing so will require the enactment of a set of local housing policies to undo past restrictions that made it harder to build in the area. Studies show that the more availability there is of affordable housing, the higher regional economic growth will be, he said.
Economic experts reached a consensus view that a rise in inflation affecting goods, gas prices, homes and more, Ramcharan said, will increase the risk of a recession. 
He advised that students preparing to enter a job market with a shortage of openings should keep their eyes and ears open for opportunities and remain flexible for second and third-choice jobs.
“You’re graduating from a great college, so you already have a leg up in the labor market,” Ramcharan said. “People will notice your CV, and you’re likely to get interviews if there are vacancies, so search hard. Send out your resumes extensively.”

When cooking with her paternal grandmother as part of an exhibit for the Los Angeles Plaza Cocina museum, Amara Aguilar learned more about her than ever before. While discussing her grandmother’s upbringing and remembering her great great grandmother, Aguilar, a professor of journalism at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, asked her grandmother about the secrets to longevity — the woman had lived to reach 93 years of age.
As Aguilar now recalls, her grandmother, Rachel Aguilar, replied, “We ate fresh food.”
Interviews with Aguilar’s grandmother and others are now on display at the “Abuelita’s Kitchen: Mexican Food Stories” exhibit at the L.A. Plaza Cocina Museum, which captures Mexican grandmothers’ stories and the generational impact of food culture. The exhibit is the brainchild of Portnoy, a professor of Spanish, whose work focuses on the food culture of L.A. and Mexico, with the input of Ximena Martin, director of public programs at L.A. Plaza de Cultura y Artes. 
The exhibit features the recipes of 10 grandmothers from different regions of Mexico alongside the kitchen products used in their cooking processes. Accompanying these are QR codes that link to audio clips of the grandmothers introducing themselves and sharing bits of their histories in California. Portnoy and her team also filmed a documentary capturing clips of the grandmothers’ cooking and sharing their personal recipes to accompany the exhibit.
The idea for “Abuelita’s Kitchen” came to Portnoy when she heard that the L.A. Plaza de Cultura y Artes Museum was searching for an exhibit idea focusing on Mexican cuisine for L.A. Plaza Cocina. Portnoy said she expressed interest in an exhibit about the food stories of Mexican and Mexican American women, which the museum accepted in stride, assisting in the creation of an exhibit focused on Mexican grandmothers. Portnoy and the museum then agreed to collaborate on what would become “Abuelita’s Kitchen.”
The project was funded by California Humanities, a foundation that connects Californians to ideas about their shared heritage and diverse cultures, from which Portnoy received a grant to create the exhibit and the accompanying documentary. 
Portnoy spent last fall finding and interviewing 10 Mexican grandmothers for the exhibit and documentary with her team of USC alumni. Portnoy said she wanted to represent Mexico’s diversity, and so conducted interviews with grandmothers from various backgrounds, including Afro-Mexican, Indigenous and Mexican American backgrounds. 
“I would spend the first hour or so just interviewing the person about not just their food stories, but their story about migration — ‘What was your childhood like? Who do they learn to cook from?’” Portnoy said. “You think it’s gonna be just about people’s food stories, but it’s so much more. It’s things about domestic violence cases, childhood hardships, all kinds of things and just the challenges of migrating and adapting to a different culture.”
Intermixed with stories of struggle and toil, the grandmothers spoke about the pride they have in their cultures and backgrounds, Portnoy said. Some grandmothers interviewed shared their experiences as descendants of escaped African slaves, while others talked about preserving their Indigenous languages within their families. No matter what their background and story, Portnoy said, the grandmothers were proud of where they came from and hoped to pass down their heritage. 
In an extension of her passion for California’s food culture, Portnoy taught a class about oral histories and identity with Aguilar in Spring 2022. Through the class, titled “Recording the Voices of Latinx Women & Food in Los Angeles: A Multimedia Oral History Project,” students created the interactive media for the exhibit, which highlighted the grandmothers’ identities and their personal histories.
“We were able to take those themes and actually, through QR codes, integrate some of the audio right into the exhibit that people could scan with their phones,” Aguilar said.
Aguilar, who specializes in Latinx storytelling, said the topic resonated with her students in the class, as they learned about their own cultures and explored stories new to them throughout the semester. Students delved into various cuisines through visits to Boyle Heights, an L.A. neighborhood with a long Chicano history, and the L.A. Times Kitchen Studios.
“It was really a blend of food in L.A., the history of L.A. cultures and traditions, Latino culture, and also media and media production and producing content for Instagram and social media as well,” Aguilar said.
Aguilar highlighted the importance of preserving Mexican culture with oral stories and fostering public understanding of the role grandmothers play in their households.
“It’s critical to preserve these stories and to honor the traditions of our grandmothers. They aren’t going to be around forever, but we want to make sure their traditions are passed on from generation to generation,” Aguilar said. “Many times, they are the anchors of our families and every single abuela I’ve met for this project is absolutely amazing.”
Andres Quintanar, a rising sophomore majoring in neuroscience and economics, grew up in a Mexican American household where his grandmother would often take care of him while his parents worked. Mexican grandmothers, he said, are the backbone of the family, and the cultural food they live around and create is a reminder of home whenever he eats it. The food each grandmother makes has a unique flavor to it that can’t be compared to restaurant-made food, Quintanar said, and is one of the most memorable parts of his childhood.
“The Mexican grandmother, I want to say, is always seen as strong,” Quintanar said. “I know my grandmothers are strong and everybody views them as so because, oftentimes, they don’t have the easiest lives. A lot of them grew up on farms … having to do a lot of hard work at home.” 
Quintanar’s grandmother regularly made him Mexican dishes, such as flautas, a dish that consists of rolled up tortillas filled with food such as chicken, beef or cheese. Quintanar also remembers his grandma’s atole, a drink made of ground corn. The experience of Mexican food, Quintanar said, is heartwarming and something he wants to pass down to younger generations.
“I know a lot of the new generation doesn’t necessarily cook as often as the older generations, but I personally really want that to carry into my own family,” Quintanar said. “I’ve even explicitly asked my grandma for her recipes, and I wrote them down on paper. Even since I was little, I would always ask because I felt like I didn’t want to necessarily depend on anybody to cook good food, I wanted to just know how to cook my grandma’s food.”
The passing down of recipes through generations is something that Aguilar also valued, though she wasn’t able to obtain her maternal grandmother’s recipes. Although she remembers the food her grandmother made as a child, the recipes were lost after her passing, Aguilar said. During the “Abuelita’s Kitchen” project, Aguilar got the chance to cook enchiladas with not only her paternal grandmother but also her daughter and father.
“It’s been really special because it’s intersections of generations, intersections of culture, intersections of tradition and intersections of family and food,” Aguilar said.

Content warning: The following article contains mentions of abortion and sexual assault.
If only the Equal Rights Amendment passed back in 1982 — but Congress didn’t want discrimination based on sex to be constitutionally prohibited. And after the overturning of Roe v. Wade on Friday, it seems the Supreme Court doesn’t want that either. 
You would think that since the ratification of the United States Constitution 234 years ago that women would have autonomy over their own bodies by now. Yet, the U.S. has a fondness for regression. Despite the number of words in this article, no number of words can describe my distress. If we cannot trust the highest tribunal in the nation to provide equal, unbiased justice under the law and protect our rights, who are we supposed to trust?
According to CNN Politics, by overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court has ruled that there is no longer a federally protected right to abortion — our abortion rights are now in the hands of our states’ governments. In other words, the Supreme Court has greenlit sweeping bans on abortion. While this depends on what state you live in, almost 50% of states already have bans in place, will pass bans or will enact strict regulations against the practice. 
But in restricting abortion, in overturning Roe v. Wade, in controlling women’s bodies, the world isn’t any safer or better. Still suffering under the cruel philosophy of the War on Drugs, we all should know that criminalizing something does not eliminate it from society — it just makes it more dangerous. 
In a nine-year cross-sectional study conducted in Tehran, Iran, researchers found that a “substantial number of induced and illegal abortions throughout the world, especially in developing countries, is resulting in maternal mortality … and a variety of physical and sexual morbidities in different societies.”
Restrictive abortion laws do not reduce abortions; they only increase the number of unintended pregnancies and preventable maternal casualties. Researchers at the World Health Organization, the Guttmacher Institute and several other academic institutes have shown that this statement is not an opinion — it is a fact.
Those seeking an abortion are not criminals. Those who need an abortion should not be left to die. Sexual assault, fetal health problems, maternal health issues or financial instability — if the Supreme Court ruled that the states can force someone to carry a child to term, are state governments prepared to eliminate these issues in order for these unborn children to be cared for? 
If the government wants to take on the responsibility of bringing children into this world, they then have the responsibility to care for said children. But according to the Adoption Network, there are “over 400,000 children in foster care in the U.S., 114,556 [of whom] cannot be returned to their families and are waiting to be adopted.” If the states cannot care for these existing children how are they to care for the ones who aren’t even born yet? 
But that’s not the Supreme Court’s job. Their job is to “impartially” interpret the constitution, so let’s take a look at this through a constitutional lens. 
Justice Samuel Alito states in the majority opinion that “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences,” before arguing that “It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives,” as he states that abortion presents a profound moral question.
However, the only erroneous decision with detrimental consequences here is that of the current Supreme Court. In bringing morality into the ruling, impartiality went right out the door as the fluidity of morality depends on structural traditions and religious beliefs — all of which wreak havoc on the Supreme Court’s ability to maintain objectivity. Evidently — despite the Sixth Amendment stating we have the right to an impartial jury on both state and federal levels — nonpartisanship can be exempted from the Supreme Court.
Now, if it’s time to heed the Constitution, then let’s do exactly that. But what constitution are you referring to, Justice Alito — that of 1788 or the present-day Constitution that has been amended 27 times? To the originalists who argue that the Constitution must be interpreted based on the original understanding “at the time it was adopted,” why does Article V, which outlines the right and procedure of changing the Constitution, exist?
We cannot use the Constitution of 1788, because it is no longer 1788. The Constitution has changed over time because our country needed to change: slavery, discrimination, segregation, sexism — the list goes on and on. For decades, the Supreme Court set precedent and made changes to the Constitution through its decisions in order to protect citizens from unjust harm and imposition on their rights. But following the overturning of 50 years of precedent set by Roe v. Wade, the lives of millions are now at risk and because of this decision, the legitimacy of the Supreme Court is now in flames. Because of this decision, the concept of justice in America isn’t just tainted — it does not exist.
On the topic of precedence, let’s not forget cases such as Skinner v. Oklahoma, wherein the court ruled that Oklahoma’s Criminal Sterilization Act of 1935 was unconstitutional, as the social and biological implications of reproduction and the irreversibility of sterilization operations violated Mr. Skinner’s rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. But strangely enough, the overturning of Roe v. Wade shows the complete opposite, that the social and biological implications of reproduction and the irreversibility of forcing childbirth on a person possess no constitutional infringement. Heaven forbid the government controls a male body, but ostensibly it is permitted to control those with a uterus.
I know this measly article is nothing more than an outlet for my rage and frustration. I’ve learned the hard way that there’s no point in arguing with a brick wall. The ignorant will remain ignorant, and no matter how much evidence you present to them, they will somehow twist it in their favor or reject it altogether. But to those reading this, not all hope is lost. I mean, they only win if we let them, so we will cry so loud they’ll be forced to hear us. 
While the deplorable decision of the Supreme Court majority has taken our federal right to an abortion, the fight for that right under state legislatures is still ongoing. Vote against proposed state constitutional amendments restricting abortions. Vote for representatives and government officials who listen and truly care. Take a pledge to fight for abortion rights. Donate. Protest. Share resources online. Write a silly little article such as this one. Do whatever you can with the resources you have, but whatever you choose to do, don’t stay silent. Your body belongs to no one but yourself, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.
