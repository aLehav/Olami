David Petraeus, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and retired four-star general, sat down with the Dean of the Keck School of Medicine of USC, Dr. Carmen Puliafito to discuss military healthcare and strategic leadership as a part of the Dean’s Distinguished Lecturer series at USC’s Health Sciences campus.

Petraeus, who has been called one of the most effective military leaders in recent U.S. history, now holds the Judge Widney Professor seat in USC’s Sol Price School of Public Policy and also serves as chairman of the Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Global Institute.
The Dean’s Distinguished Lecturer Series has brought renowned individuals to the USC Health Sciences campus to discuss current critical health care issues. Earlier this year, the series hosted Amgen chairman and CEO Robert A. Bradway and Dr. David B. Agus, author of The New York Times #1 bestselling book, The End of Illness.
During the lecture, Petraeus and Puliafito discussed the status of veteran affairs in this country and medical support for service members.
“There’s no doubt that we need to do more, but there’s also no doubt that we have done a great deal, and we’re in the process of doing even more,” Petraeus said. “The challenge, though, is that we have people surviving that never would have survived before … leaving the battlefield with life-altering injuries and wounds.”
Petraeus cited improvements in battlefield response times due to improved technologies and medical knowledge as the main reason for the increased survival rate for service members who suffer serious injuries in combat. He said some of the worst damage can be the lasting psychological impact after soldiers return from combat.
“It’s actually when that individual goes home, and the band stops playing and the flag stops flying,” Petraeus said.
Petraeus spent the day touring the USC Health Science campus, visiting various research centers and operating rooms and meeting with medical students. Petraeus also visited the LAC+USC Navy Trauma Training Center. Four leaders from the Navy Trauma Training Center program, Commander Patricia Hasen, Commander Michael Kearns, Lieutenant Commander Kimberly Syres and Lieutenant Commander Daniel Grabo attended the lecture.
For the past 12 years, the Keck School of Medicine of USC has trained health professionals in the LAC+USC Navy Trauma Training Center. According to Puliafito, the doctors and nurses trained through the program have saved the lives of thousands of service members and civilians.
“It was an honor to have General Petraeus visit our program today. He’s an incredible leader and a role model, especially for those of us in uniform,” Syres said.
Puliafito was grateful for Petraeus’ visit to the Health Sciences campus.
“He’s the most inspiring speaker we’ve had here. He established a real personal [connection ] with everyone he met here, with the students and the Navy Trauma Training Center. He was very engaged with what is happening here at USC.”
Petraeus also told of his efforts to reduce violence in Iraq during the surge and slow the momentum of the Taliban in Afghanistan during comprehensive civil-military counterinsurgency campaigns. He cited the book Grant Takes Command by Bruce Catton as an inspiration during the early days of the surge in Iraq.
“The determination that Grant showed was really extraordinary,” Petraeus said. “All those in uniform have experienced those tough days … and that’s when you just have to hang tough. You can’t let your shoulders slump.”

On Tuesday night, Undergraduate Student Government held an event that allowed students to voice their opinions on improving accessibility for students with disabilities on campus. Vice President Rini Sampath,University Affairs Director Jordan Fowler and Assistant Director of Diversity Affairs Andy Su led the discussion. Topics covered at the presentation included building renovation, campus athletics, accommodations and academic policies for students with disabilities.

Zack Wentz, a sophomore majoring in economics, inspired USG to hold the event. While pledging the leadership fraternity Delta Omicron Zeta, he was asked to create a presentation about an issue on campus. He presented it to Sampath, who recognized his passion for improving accessibility on campus and brought the issue back to USG.
Wentz, a recipient of the Swim with Mike scholarship, was paralyzed from the chest down six years ago. The mission of the scholarship is to enable athletes who have endured tragedy to complete their education and realize their full potential.
Wentz said that ever since he applied to USC, it has been a vision of his to see disabled students play a basketball game or a football game — to see students with disabilities compete and play together. Wentz feels that USC does not provide the resources necessary for disabled students to not only play the sports they love, but also get into certain buildings or classrooms feasibly.
“I am an athlete and many of the athletic facilities are extremely out of date. For example, my sport growing up and the sport my scholarship is based on is tennis, and I can’t even go watch the men’s or women’s tennis matches because there is zero viewing access. There is no elevator, only stairs, to the viewing area.”
Wentz also said that students with disabilities don’t have the same opportunities as other students when it comes to viewing football games.
“And then, the Coliseum, while there is accessible seating, it’s not at the heart of the action,” he said. “It’s not near the student section. And also for classrooms, there are some classrooms in which the only option for seating for students with disabilities is a giant coffee table at the front of the room right next to the professor. There just should be better options.”
Keshan Sirimane, a sophomore majoring in international relations (global business), mentioned issues with accessibility at certain USC apartments.
“There are a lot of loopholes that USC jumps through as far as accessibility in off-campus housing. There are limitations that USC does have,” Sirimane said. “We want to renovate all these buildings, but like for my apartment, Regal Trojan, if they wanted to just put a ramp in, they would have to go to the city and get it approved. It would be a mess, according to Housing, that USC wouldn’t be able to afford.”
Sampath talked about potential projects to put proposals in place to improve accessibility on campus. These proposals included renovating current housing options, getting people with physical disabilities access to the front row of the student section in the Coliseum and trying to organize a basketball game for people in wheelchairs, possibly through a partnership with the Swim with Mike organization. She also mentioned that USG, ideally with some student advocates, will have a meeting with Pat Haden, USC’s athletic director, about improving accessibility in athletic facilities.
Making sure that accessibility is at the forefront of concerns for USC was another topic of discussion at the meeting. Students felt that not only should newly built buildings be fully accessible for students with disabilities, but renovation of old buildings should also be a main concern.
Wentz thinks that the best first step in raising awareness for the improvement of resources for students with disabilities is the event he has coordinated with USG. He hopes that after this event, people will eventually see the issue the way he sees it now.
Fowler said that she, Sampath and Su had all been recently approached by students who had concerns about accessibility for disabled students on campus. The three USG members felt that it would be best to hold this event in order to bring all of those students together, define the problem and possible solutions, so they can move onto the next step.
“It’s really easy to have a problem and just complain about it and not go to anybody,” Fowler said. “But these students saw USG as a resource and an outlet for serious change to occur for them. We want them to be in those meetings with us. We’re not going to just take this project and run with it. We want them to be an integral part in the solution. We just have some of the connections to make it happen.”
Sampath is positive that USG, with the help of these students, can affect change.
“Our individual responsibility is to push the administration and say, ‘Why not?’” Sampath said, “Why not? That is their job. If we make enough student noise, they have to do it. As long as we are able to consolidate this information and we create an action plan, we can make it happen.”
Fowler talked about her opinion on these students not having the resources that should be available.
“It’s heartbreaking. You don’t really think about it if you’re able bodied, but if you’re limited based on your circumstances to entering certain areas, that’s uncomfortable and unfair,” Fowler said. “This conversation will be great because even though [USC] is doing the best they can do, it’s not promoted well enough, and these students can help get the word out.”

The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted a live election watch party at the Ground Zero Performance Café at USC on Tuesday night. The watch party consisted of a live streaming of midterm election results alongside a panel discussion by distinguished faculty and guest speakers to analyze and discuss the results.
Election 2014 · Above, Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute of Politics, moderates a panel discussion during a live election viewing party at the Ground Zero Performance Café on Tuesday. – Chandler Golan | Daily Trojan
The discussion featured panelists Robert Shrum, Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics and professor in the Department of Political Science; Sam Blakeslee, founding director of California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo Institute for Advanced Technology and Public Policy; Rick Jacobs, deputy chief of staff of operations for Los Angeles  Mayor Garcetti’s office; Jennifer Massey, president of USC College Republicans; and Nick Germain, political director of USC College Democrats.
Moderating the analysis of election results was Dan Schnur, executive director of the Unruh Institute. Schnur opened up the panel discussion by asking each panelist to state what Republicans and Democrats should be looking for in this midterm election. Panelists all seemed to agree that the Republican Party would make gains in the Senate.
Massey commented on the decisive role Republicans play in this year’s midterm elections.
“Election day, I feel, is America’s last chance to judge President Obama’s policies, so I think it is really important that the people that are not happy with them go out and vote, and I think that is what is happening,” Massey said. “I am really pleased with how it [the election] turned out because I feel that in this election, people came together and voted as Americans, not as Democrats or Republicans — they voted on the policies that were in place. It was not as partisan.”
Germain discussed the losses within the Democratic Party in Congress.
“It looks to me like the Democrats are probably going to come up short on this midterm in terms of the U.S. Senate, and I believe the Democrats are also set to lose seats in the House,” Germain said. “However, here in the state of California, I believe that we again, like 2010, will buck the national trend and we will retain dominance in all statewide elected offices and retain strong majorities in both houses of the legislature.”
Shrum projected a loss for Democrats in Senate and discussed change among the results unlikely.
“If you look at what has to happen for Democrats to do something unprecedented, its gonna require a lot of breaks. I think some of the breaks have happened,”  Shrum said. “Bottom line is, you’re probably going to see the Republicans take control of the Senate. It’s possible they won’t, but what didn’t happen so far is a wave — the kind of big thing that happened in 2006, when Democrats had to win every single close race to take over the Senate and that is exactly what they did. That is not what is happening right now. In fact, the generic congressional vote is very close in the exit polls, and Democrats may be cycling in.”
Blakeslee also commented on the outcome of midterm elections.
“I think sort of a long-term take away is regardless of what the specific numbers are today, is that there is a more energized, traditional base inside the party that does not want to lose because a more extreme, or flawed, fan base that end up making it through the primary system,” Blakeslee said
Blakeslee also discussed the importance of assessing Colorado’s results in the midterm election. He, like other panelists, mentioned Colorado as an indicator of whether or not Republicans are starting to gain leverage in Congress.
Massey said that she would pay close attention to the female Republican candidates in this midterm election who could make history by breaking race and age barriers. She mentioned women such as Utah’s 4th congressional district candidate, Mia Love, and Elise Stefanik, New York’s 21st congressional district candidate.
Schnur then asked panelists to discuss party candidates for the 2016 presidential elections.
Shrum and Germain both agreed that Hillary Clinton would dominate the Democratic Party in the presidential race.
“I think the only person who could win over Hillary Clinton, is Hillary Clinton,” Shrum said.
Shrum went on to project that Republicans will gain great wins in taking control of Senate.
“I think this will be a very good night for Republicans. I think they have basically picked up to six seats in the Senate and as many as nine … which would take Democrats down to 46 seats in the Senate,” Shrum said.
Alex Kludjian, a senior majoring in political science, attended the event and was excited about the future of the Republican Party.
“Ultimately, I think this election has been a decisive victory for Republicans and a referendum on the failed policies of the Obama administration,” Kludjian said. “I think from here on out, now that Republicans do have control of both Congress and the Senate there is a big opportunity for the reinvigoration for the party and its message, so I’m really excited about our future.”
Christopher Perse, a sophomore majoring in political science and history, found Republican successes predictable.
“I’m not really surprised the [amount of] seats Republicans took this election. I am surprised that they had so much success, but I am not surprised that they picked up the Senate,” Perse said. “I was a little surprised on some of the results in states like Florida. I’m surprised Rick Scott won the governorship and I am really surprised the medical marijuana proposition didn’t pass.”

Breakups suck. Whether you are 21 years old and think you’ve lost the love of your life or just 14 and going through your first heartbreak, it feels like your whole world is coming to an end. You lose your appetite. Love songs remind you of that special someone. You are always on the verge of multiple emotional breakdowns.
Shake it off · When the inevitable run-in with an ex happens it is important to stay cordial, smile and make eye contact. But while aknowledgement is important one does not need to feel pressured into a hug. – Photo illustration by Razan Al Marzouqi
 
I will never forget one of my worst breakups, when I could not go without crying for more than an hour — and that’s being generous. And, to be completely honest, college makes breakups only more difficult. In the “real world” when you and your significant other break up, you don’t have to worry about running into them at the Campus Center, the 9-0 or the frat parties that upcoming weekend, but unfortunately at USC, such encounters are inevitble. It should come as no surprise that the one person you do not want to see is the person you will probably see several times a week. Our campus of 18,000 undergrad students seems to turn into a small liberal arts college where everyone knows your business and there is seemingly no escape. Now when people ask how your relationship is, you have to reply sweetly, “We are no longer together,” and then comes the game of 20 questions. It seems that when someone is going through a difficult time, all social protocol goes out the window and your life becomes an episode of The Real Housewives. All you want to do is crawl into your bed and lie there for days.
One thing I have learned from past experiences is that you can control the pain. A great way to deal with the new loneliness is to fill your life with friendship. Call up your friends for a night out on the town, a movie or even just to do homework together. The first few days will feel like they go on for eternity, but friends are a great distraction. They may want to talk about the breakup and that is fine — for a little while there will be things you need to let out — but if you start to feel overwhelmed, tell them you want to move on from the subject. Relationships can be extremely time consuming and can distract us from other relationships, and we often forget to pay attention to those around us. Use this time to catch up on everything that has been going on with friends. There is nothing people love talking about more than themselves, and it will show them how much you still value you their friendship.
It is impossible to be with your friends 24/7, however, and running into your ex is almost inevitable, but there are ways of navigating the awkward run-in. There are a few factors that go into how you will react when running into your ex: If it was a messy breakup, if he/she dumped you, if you dumped them and what you’re feeling like that day. You have to put all of these factors and feelings aside, be as angry, sad or even happy as you want on the inside, but you must be externally cordial. First things first, you must smile and wave if you make eye contact — you both meant a lot to each other, and it hurts when you are not acknowledged by the other person. Your former significant other should not be treated as a stranger — part of the person you are at this point in your life is because of the time you spent with them. But even though you need to be nice, this does not mean you have to hug them. They may go in for the friendly hug, but you can say you do not think you’re ready to hug it out. That could potentially make them mad or upset, but remember that you have done nothing wrong, and at this point, you have to think about your mental well-being, not theirs. If they cared for you, they will understand that you cannot go from spending many nights together cuddling, to dealing with their absence and then finally to accepting personal contact.
Since I am fortunate enough to be a female and can understand sensitive side of the situation, this part will be directed at the women: Go ahead and eat that whole tub of Ben and Jerry’s Phish Food. The first few days after a breakup are the hardest, and you need to do what will make you happy. When I had my bad breakup, my diet consisted of cookies (baked by my friends) and bacon for about two days. To some, this might not be the most delicious combination, but for me, it was my heaven away from hell. That being said, do not make it a habit. Stay healthy. Do not try to drop 25 pounds because you think it will make you feel better or binge eat because it’s what heroines in movies do. Try to maintain a balance. If you are happy loving your body and you believe you are fueling yourself in the right ways, that is what matters. All girls’ definitions of beauty and happiness are different, but no matter what your way is, you should indulge.
For me, after my binge eating episode, I wanted to prove to myself that I was going to be okay and prove to him that he did not break me. I treated myself to a spa day — not the expensive kind in Beverly Hills, but one in my apartment. I did my hair. I cleared my pores. I painted my nails, and I put on a killer outfit that made me feel beautiful. When I saw myself put together, I knew I did not need a man to make me happy or feel complete. The thing I needed most was to feel confident in myself, and I did. So ladies, do what makes you happy, eventually the pain will go away. I promise.

On any given USC game day, vendors are stationed on every corner with their irresistible bacon-wrapped hot dogs, known as Victory Dogs. With the August opening of Dirt Dog on Figueroa, students can now indulge in this game day favorite every day.
Bringing the heat · The Green (top left), Red (top right) and House (bottom left) dogs carry Dirt Dog’s bold-flavored menu. A good selection of sides such as the Dirty Corn (bottom right) compelent the dogs. – Photo courtesy of Dirt Dog
The new stand-alone gourmet hot dog restaurant takes its dogs far beyond those of street vendors. It became the mission of Richard Larios, Timothy Cam and Chef Philip Ozaki to honor one of Los Angeles’s most beloved street food with their hot dog shack.
After being consistently disappointed with the basic options offered in the area, the men came together to create the best of the best. The buns are delivered daily from Melrose Bakery, most sauces are made in-house  and only the freshest vegetables are used. Made from high-quality skinless, all-beef Nathan’s hot dogs combined with unique topping combinations, these dogs are on another level.
Upon entering the restaurant, customers are greeted by attentive, friendly staff. Dirt Dog offers a laid back atmosphere with multiple counters and tables perfect for intermingling among customers. Many look around curiously and, at times, stare enviously at the orders of their neighbors thanks to the creative and diverse menu offered at Dirt Dog.
From the dogs to the sides to the desserts, everything at the restaurant is served in a signature “Dirty Style.” There is a wide array of options for anyone ready to fall deep into an extreme food coma. The four hot dog variations hit all categories with a classic dog, a California-style dog, a spicy dog and even one with an Asian twist.
According to the staff, the House Dog is a consistent favorite. The all-beef hot dog wrapped with center cut bacon is topped with grilled onions and bell peppers, all cooked in Thousand Island bacon sauce. Customers have a choice of a traditional, Portuguese or lobster bun coated with a green chili spread. The dog is garnished with ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise and bacon bits, and the result is a delicious bombardment of classic hot dog flavors with a unique Dirt Dog twist.
Customers also rave about the Red Dog. The Red is a remix on the signature bacon-wrapped dog topped with onions and peppers and sautéed in spicy tomato chili sauce, red pepper flakes and bacon bits, seated in a bun smeared with chipotle aioli spread. All of this makes for a spicy and satisfying culinary experience.
Dirt Dog goes far beyond just hot dogs with their delicious sides and desserts. Their homemade Dirty Fries and Dirty Chips are perfectly seasoned with Limón Chile and served with side of Ketchatio, a combination of chili ketchup and Tapatio. But, the real secret behind these legendary sides is that they are fried in beef tallo, which gives them an surprising amount of flavor. The Dirty Corn is slightly disappointing in comparison. It has creative flavors with its crema, cotija cheese, cilantro, bacon bits and chili powder, but it is only a half-piece for $2.50.
Dirt Dog is a far cry from the stereotypical California eating experience. For customers who can somehow stomach more than just the incredible hot dogs, Dirt Dog is one of the few places in town that serves deep-fried Oreos and Twinkies. Moist on the inside and perfectly crisp on the outside, these creations are a twist on two beloved desserts.
Dirt Dog is the perfect new addition to Figueroa, but its distance from USC’s campus might mean that the restaurant will miss out on becoming a destination for hungry Trojans. Nonetheless, Dirt Dog has the potential to thrive. The creative and delicious selection of foods will likely attract customers from more than just the surrounding area. Dirt Dog is Downtown’s best option for beloved L.A. street food, so get ready to eat like it’s game day every day.

The big news around the country this week has been surrounding the midterm elections. But the poll I was most interested in seeing Tuesday wasn’t any Gallup poll, expected voter poll or exit poll.
It was the College Football Playoff’s Week 11 poll.
The College Football Playoff system replaced the Bowl Championship Series this year to determine the national champion in NCAA Division I-A football. While the BCS picked only two teams at the end of the regular season to participate in a national championship game, the CFP will pick four teams to compete in a two-round playoff to determine who wins the national title.
Every college football fan I know is beyond thrilled that a playoff will finally determine which team is the best in the country. But there is plenty of uncertainty over how the CFP’s selection committee will pick the four teams to compete in the first-ever playoff.
To make the best decision, I would highly encourage the CFP to actually pay some attention to those midterm elections. As different as they may seem, the national championship debate reminds me a lot of the national political debate.
Though I won’t reveal my party affiliation, there is someone I’m always rooting for a little bit during U.S. elections: Nate Silver.
Silver launched somewhat of a revolution in probability and statistical analysis with his highly publicized and shockingly accurate political predictions in the last two presidential elections. He was so good in politics that ESPN hired him to apply his analysis to projecting outcomes in the sports world. His research proved how important quantitative data can be when trying to understand the world. I love any time the results validate his guesses because it gives sportswriters like me hope that we, too, can sound smart if we stare at the numbers long enough.
The CFP hasn’t really offered any criteria on how its selection committee decided on the first poll. We’ll probably get a little more insight into the thought process on the final poll, but the system is much more open-ended than the BCS system. In fact, a selection committee was brought together to do almost the exact opposite of what the BCS did. But the BCS system looked at football much in the same way Silver looks at political races, and Silver’s method of analysis is proven to work.
The BCS averaged subjective polls from coaches and journalists with computerized polls based on objective statistics. The computer polls’ primary goal were to create some formula to measure strength of schedule when teams finished with equal records.
To do so, the formulas kept track of the records of teams’ opponents, the records of their conferences and the ratio of teams’ games played at home to on the road.
The computer polls got a lot of flak from media members — who, of course, thought media polls were much more accurate. It felt impure that some formula could measure such a personal form of human performance like college football — “Siri, which college football team is the best in the nation?” — and journalists argued that rigid statistics could not account for the subtleties necessary to understand the quality of a team. Beat writers argued that they could recognize which teams legitimately were the best in the nation even if arbitrary numbers didn’t add up.
But the BCS ranking system was unveiled in 1998 before the “sabermetrics” revolution in sports. Advanced statistics first popped up in baseball relatively recently. Today, advanced stats are also applied to soccer, basketball, hockey and, of course, football. It seems, however, that judgment on the validity of “the computers” was made before advancements in the field proved how valuable statistical analysis could be.
The selection committee will rely on the opinions of just 13 panelists, one of whom is our very own Pat Haden. Several of the panelists are university athletic directors, like Haden. All of them have either played college football or worked in some capacity with the NCAA, an athletic conference or a university with the exception of Steve Wieberg, the only full-time sportswriter of the bunch. The idea is that each committee member is an expert on football, capable of watching a team play and knowing if it is on the level of past national champions.
Regardless of whether the committee members really are experts — Condoleezza Rice is a bit of a head-scratcher, but she was the provost of Stanford before serving as the Secretary of State — I would highly encourage the committee members to consult statistical analysis. It would be very easy for each member to succumb to his or her own regional bias — Haden would probably like to think that any team from the Pac-12 is the best in the country — especially given how many teams and conferences there are to judge between. But there’s valuable information out there about point differential, yards allowed, red zone efficiency, turnover margin and time of possession. This information doesn’t necessarily need to be the deciding factor on a decision, but should certainly be considered.
The CFP waited until Week 10 to come out with its first poll and had Mississippi State, Florida State, Auburn and Ole Miss in the top four. Notable snubs from the playoff were then-No. 5 Oregon and then-No. 6 Alabama.
The decision-making got a little easier in Week 11, as Ole Miss fell to Auburn, allowing Oregon to jump to No. 4. But the Crimson Tide, who moved up to No. 5, still have to play Auburn and Mississippi State, so there’s plenty more drama to come with each successive poll.
While there isn’t any real hope for a spot in the playoff for USC, the Trojans could get a crack at knocking Oregon out of the playoff in the Pac-12 title game. Such a scenario would almost be déjà-vu from 2011, when the Lane Kiffin-led and postseason-ineligible Trojans defeated the then-No. 4 Ducks to eliminate Oregon from the national title conversation.
Sure enough, if USC did beat Oregon in that hypothetical scenario, it would do a big favor to Mr. Kiffin. Alabama, where Kiffin is now the offensive coordinator, would surely leapfrog Oregon in the CFP poll and have a spot in the playoff if the Ducks lost again.
Hey Nate, what are the odds of that?

USC’s football team is heading into its first weekend without a game since late September. Over this weekend, Trojan fans will have to sit back and watch the national and the Pac-12 landscapes shift beyond their control. Daily Trojan sports editors Aubrey Kragen and Will Hanley, along with Editor-In-Chief Euno Lee, sat down to discuss the Trojans’ season so far and going forward.
Workhorse · Redshirt junior running back Javorius “Buck” Allen is well on his way to earning offensive MVP honors for the Trojans this year. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Q: The Trojans are hitting the home stretch and they have a matchup against Cal on a Thursday along with the two rivalry games after that. They’re 6-3 right now. What’s their record going to be at the end of the season?
Will Hanley: 9-3. The Trojans have the talent to beat nearly any team in the country. Individually, USC can claim more Pac-12 Player of the Week awards — six, between offense, defense and special teams — than any other Pac-12 squad thus far. The Trojans’ results as a team, however, do not tell that story, and believing in them to go undefeated from here on out is an admittedly dangerous proposition. Everything depends on which USC team shows up on a given Saturday — or Thursday. Will it be the squad that held on for gutsy road wins at Arizona and Stanford, or the group that was eviscerated by an entirely average Boston College offense? Because there is clearly no way to predict that, it still seems a little foolish to pick against the Trojans’ talent.
Cal has given up at least 30 points to all but one FBS opponent this season, and it’s hard to believe the Bears’ offense can keep them in the game against a stout USC defensive front. Though rivalry games are always a crapshoot, UCLA nonetheless has yet to put together impressive performances from its offense and defense in the same game. A 17-7 home win over Arizona does not inspire confidence that the Bruins can match their crosstown rivals’ firepower. And Notre Dame? Well, our luck against the Irish has to change at some point, right?
Aubrey Kragen: In our first columnist roundtable this year, I predicted that USC would go 14-1 and win the national championship. And after the first game of the season, my ridiculous claim didn’t seem so ridiculous. But the Trojans have hilariously stumbled a few times this season, and I have a feeling they won’t go smoothly through these last three games. We’ll probably beat Cal, but lose to UCLA and Notre Dame. Despite not looking terribly impressive this season, the Bruins have escaped with a handful of wins that they didn’t deserve, and the Nov. 22 tilt between the crosstown rivals will probably fall in their favor, simply because this USC season has been impossible to predict, and Notre Dame is one call away from being undefeated this year.
Q: How would you grade USC head coach Steve Sarkisian’s performance as a coach so far?
Euno Lee: I’d grade Sarkisian’s season a solid B, with the understanding that it’s his first season with a completely new set of players. I’m disappointed that he couldn’t find a way to bring back Clancy Pendergast, who did brilliant things with the defensive backs last season. For a reason that completely escapes me given the generally dilapidated state of Pac-12 defenses, this man does not have a job.
What I certainly respect is that Sarkisian takes chances and puts faith in his players to execute. The sky is the limit with this Trojan offense, and though it can be hampered by some shaky play-calling at times, Kessler still has 25 touchdowns to two interceptions on the season.
WH: B-minus. As much as USC fans don’t want to hear this, Sarkisian and the Trojans are legitimately a Hail Mary away from being 7-2, and a converted fourth-and-2 away from being 8-1. Yes, a purely results-based evaluation is flawed. And yes, USC even finding itself in situations to lose those games can partially be blamed on the coaching staff. Still, I’d bet that most fans would be willing to look the other way about those coaching errors if a little luck swung their team’s way.
Losing close games against ranked conference opponents is no knock on a rookie head coach. If anything, Sarkisian’s deserves a downgrade for one thing: his team’s woeful lack of preparation against Boston College. Without prognosticating about where the season could have gone if the Trojans had won that game, the 37-31 loss cast a pall over a season that started with a lot of hope. It was an inexcusable result among excusable inconsistency.
Q: With just three games remaining, who would you tab the Trojans’ offensive and defensive MVPs at the end of the season?
WH: Offense: redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen. Defense: sophomore linebacker Su’a Cravens.
Man, I wish I could give the offensive award to two people. Both Allen and redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler have exceeded expectations, and both rank at or near the top of the Pac-12 in a variety of statistical categories. If anything, I have to give Allen the nod for pure value. The Tallahassee, Florida, native has only one sub-100-yard rushing game this season — in the loss to BC — while two of his three best performances in terms of yards per carry have come in key wins over Arizona and Stanford. Kessler, on the other hand, had his two worst performances of the year in those games.
Defense is a no-doubter. I swear Cravens has figured out a way to be in two places at once this season. The man has been all over the field, racking up 12.5 tackles for loss — costing opponents a total of 67 yards — all while figuring out a new position. Get well soon, Su’a.
AK: You know it’s a weird season when the quarterback who sets the school record for touchdown passes in a game isn’t the consensus pick for offensive MVP. But like my fellow sports editor, I’ve also gotta tab Buck Allen as that guy. He’s always been dependable, takes care of the ball, and sustains drives. He doesn’t score as many touchdowns as you’d expect, and when he does, they aren’t as spectacular as Nelson Agholor’s punt return touchdowns, but he somewhat quietly accrued the ninth-most rushing yards in the nation.
If I say Leonard Williams for defensive MVP, will that launch him back into the conversation for the first pick in the 2015 NFL Draft? Yeah, I’m gonna do that. Rooting for you, Leo.

The biggest tournament of the fall season is just around the corner, and USC’s men’s and women’s tennis teams are looking to take a bite out of the Big Apple.
Second the best · Senior Yannick Hanfmann is currently ranked No. 2 in the nation by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association and earned the second seed at the ITA National Indoor Tournament in New York this week. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
On Thursday, play kicks off at the USTA/ITA National Indoor Intercollegiate Championship in Flushing, New York, and six players will represent Troy.
On the women’s side, senior co-captain Zoë Scandalis and junior Giuliana Olmos will compete in the singles draw. Scandalis, who is ranked No. 15 in the ITA’s preseason singles rankings, will meet Houston’s No. 68 Despoina Vogasari in the first round, while 38th-ranked Olmos will clash with UNC’s 35th-ranked Caroline Price.
Scandalis punched her ticket to New York by taking home the singles crown at the ITA Southwest Regional Championship. The San Diego native looked dominant throughout, not dropping a single set. Last year, Scandalis went 23-11 overall and made a trip to the ITA National Indoors with Olmos to compete in doubles. The duo made it to the semifinals but fell in a tough three-setter.
Olmos will appear in both doubles and singles this year, after receiving an at-large berth for singles. Despite enjoying success with Scandalis in doubles last season (the duo went 22-8 and finished the season ranked No. 11 in the ITA poll), Olmos is now teaming up with freshman Gabby Smith. This pairing of youth and experience won the doubles title at the ITA Southwest Regionals to earn their spot at National Indoors.
Olmos said that despite it being Smith’s first collegiate season, the two are a great match.
“We have really good chemistry on the court, and that’s really important,” Olmos said. “We’re just getting used to playing aggressive and trying to take the net away from our opponents.”
Their win at the regional tournament earned the squad a first-round bye, but in the second round, they’ll face Texas A&M’s Ines Dehaza and Rachel Pierson.
The men’s team is also sending one doubles squad and two singles players to New York.
Senior Yannick Hanfmann, who made the trip the last two years, headlines the group this week. The Karlsruhe, Germany, native is ranked No. 2 in the nation and earned the No. 2 seed in the tournament, behind only Louisville’s Sebastian Stiefelmeyer, who beat Hanfmann in the finals of the ITA All-American Championships last month.
Last year, Hanfmann fell in the first round of ITA Indoors to Oklahoma’s Guillermo Alcorta, who he later beat in the Trojans’ victory over the Sooners in the NCAA Championship. This year, his first-round opponent is Ohio State’s Mikael Torpegaard, a freshman who earned a berth to the tournament by winning the ITA Midwest Regional championship. Torpegaard showed his ability to upset higher-ranked players, as he beat Illinois’ 6th-ranked Jared Hiltzik in the title match.
Hanfmann will need to overcome his persistent knee injuries and stay on his toes to make a run in the tournament.
He’ll also be pulling double duty, competing alongside senior Roberto Quiroz in the doubles draw. This international pairing (Quiroz hails from Guayaquil, Ecuador) has earned the No. 19 slot in the nation this preseason.
“Roberto hasn’t played a ton this fall, which I would have liked for him to have done,” said USC men’s tennis head coach Peter Smith.
Quiroz’s only action this season came at the ITA All-American tournament, where he and Hanfmann fell in the title match to the top-ranked team in the nation, Tennessee’s Mikelis Libietis and Hunter Reese.
The team will aim for similar success this week, as they face the winner of the matchup between Columbia’s Richard Pham and Mike Vermeer, and NC State’s Ian Dempster and Robbie Mudge after their first round bye.
Play kicks off in New York on Thursday morning and the tournament runs until Nov. 9.

Students will be America’s tomorrow. Today’s education system is failing them. Fortunately, the poor quality of teaching in California is about be a thing of the past. According to last week’s edition of Time magazine, Judge Rolf M. Treu took down California laws governing teaching tenure and other job protections that are more than 50 years old because they “violate the state’s constitution.” Though the article in Time is exceptionally informative and makes valuable points, the cover art for the article has been a major issue for many teachers. It features an image of a gavel suspended in midair, ready to smash an apple, suggesting that the law is now involved in differentiating good teachers from the bad. The reactions from the teaching community have been unreasonably sensitive.
According to Nick Canedo, a contributing writer at Syracuse.com, teachers expect an apology from Time and want a boycott of the magazine because they believe that it has launched a “misleading attack” on educators with the cover art and blurb. The backlash against Time for its cover and blurb — which reads, “It’s nearly impossible to fire a bad teacher” — include tweets such as, “Shame on @TIME for their new cover. All it takes to fire a bad teacher is a principal actually doing their job and providing evidence” and “@Time cover on teacher tenure sends the wrong message! Our teachers need support, not attacks. #timefail.”
According to the actual article in Time that the cover art refers to, Silicon Valley entrepreneur David Welch made the issue of teacher tenure a major part of his life. Teacher tenure is permanent employment status created to keep teachers from being dismissed unfairly. Welch discovered, however, that it sometimes took years and thousands of dollars to fire bad teachers in some districts. With this in mind, Welch asked a California superintendent what was needed to improve public schools. The superintendent responded with, “Give me control over my workforce.”
Though the practice of tenure in teaching negatively affects the quality of education for students in the public school system, tenure at universities can also cause issues among the faculty. Cecilia Woloch, a former faculty member of USC’s Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, spoke about tenure issues at USC. “The administration has gone on record saying that the use of NTT (non-tenure track) faculty is a ‘cost-cutting measure.’ In other words, we provide a low-wage labor pool,” she told Neon Tommy last October. Though the tenure issue needs to be addressed in public schools for the safety of students’ education, it also must be addressed in private universities. Now, administrations can easily manipulate the system to either exploit or promote teachers’ salaries, positions and importance in the university’s hierarchy.
With an understanding of the actual content of the Time article, the controversy over the cover art seems almost ridiculous in comparison. Another image printed in the magazine did feature good and bad apples, so to just assume that the apples on the cover represent bad teachers alone is a break in logic. Therefore, the cover art discussing the implementation of stricter evaluations of the quality of teachers should be respected and appreciated for its creativity and metaphorical value. If a teacher is, in fact, a valuable asset, then he or she should not be so affected by artwork depicting the law coming down on those who give teachers a bad name because they are not a part of that group of educators. Instead, they should be celebrating the acknowledgement that there is, and will be, a distinction between the good and bad teachers.
Amid the outrage from teachers, Time managing editor Nancy Gibbs addressed the issue of the artwork. According to news site Education Dive, Gibbs said that Time “admires the nation’s teachers,” and she expressed “dismay that many may have heard the coverage ‘mischaracterized’ before being able to read it.” In fact, to help have a more informed debate, Gibbs made the story available for free on Time’s website so everyone has the opportunity to read it. It must be understood that opinions regarding the article should not be made based solely on the cover art; the content of the article is too valuable to dismiss because some might find the artwork offensive.
The controversy with the cover aside, the magazine brings up an issue that pervades educational systems in many places, including USC. It’s a problem that hits close to home. Here on campus, teacher tenure needs to end because it creates an opportunity for unequal pay among staff members. We have incredible faculty, and it is disheartening to think that some of the most talented professors are treated unfairly because of the lack of tenure tied to their position.

The University of California, Berkeley’s recent invitation to political talk show host Bill Maher to speak at commencement has outraged many students. Despite a student petition against the university’s invitation, the administration has chosen not to rescind his invitation to speak in December. The university must recognize that a revocation of this invitation would not limit Maher’s free speech since speaking at a commencement is an honor and a privilege, not a right. Instead, revoking the invitation would mean listening to the needs and wants of the students.
Elizabeth Cutbirth | Daily Trojan
 
After the announcement of the invitation, a petition was launched by a student government leader and members of the campus advocacy group Middle Eastern, Muslim and South Asian Coalition. It dubbed Maher “a blatant bigot and racist” for comments he made earlier this month on his show, Real Time With Bill Maher. Maher’s uneducated comments included describing Islam as “the only religion that acts like the Mafia, that will f-cking kill you if you say the wrong thing, draw the wrong picture or write the wrong book” and that “the Muslim world … has too much in common with ISIS,” according to the Washington Post. In response to student protests, UC Berkeley officials wrote in a statement to students on Oct. 29, “The UC Berkeley administration cannot and will not accept this decision, which appears to have been based solely on Mr. Maher’s opinions and beliefs, which he conveyed through constitutionally protected speech.” Associating the entire Muslim population with a small extremist group like ISIS is a clear testament to Maher’s lack of knowledge and ability to speak truthfully about Muslims. The petition has gathered at least 5,231 signatures now, indicating students’ strong desire to revoke the invitation.
UC Berkeley asserted that its campus is known for being the home of the free speech movement in 1964 and that the decision does not endorse any of Maher’s statements, deeming it irrelevant in the context of a commencement. By not taking action for students, however, the school’s administration is indirectly contributing to the perpetuation of Islamophobia. It’s a phenomenon that has seriously impacted the Muslim population, especially since 2001, through forms of verbal abuse and physical abuse, and it’s one that should not be taken lightly.
Maher’s freedom of speech is not being threatened by the petition, especially considering he has his own show in which he freely voices his opinions about a variety of topics. Maher even said this himself, tweeting, “Every news outlet asking me 4 comment on this Berkeley thing but then i remembered: I’VE got a show! And thats where I’ll address it, Fri nite.” Rather than apologize for his comments and educate himself on what Islam truly is, Maher isn’t even trying to understand where Berkeley students are coming from with their protests, and instead, seems to be focusing solely on his “freedom of speech being taken away.” Not to mention, he doesn’t even have the expertise to comment on this religion. The truth is that there are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world and a very small percentage of that population is extremist, just as in any other religion.
In fact, a large percentage of Muslims condemn the actions of extremist groups. The root of the word Islam, “salam,” means peace, and countless Quranic verses condemn violence. For example, the Qur’an states in chapter 5 verse 32, “Because of this did We ordain unto the children of Israel that if anyone slays a human being — unless it be [in punishment] for murder or for spreading corruption on earth — it shall be as though he had slain all mankind; whereas, if anyone saves a life, it shall be as though he had saved the lives of all mankind.”
Society needs to seriously consider and question those like Maher who have these kinds of false notions about an entire group of people. Though he has every right to voice his thoughts, it does not mean that his ideas should be honored and go unrefuted. Berkeley should instead focus on hosting a speaker who is a critical thinker and avoids offensive and incorrect overgeneralizations of a group of people.
Yasmeen, this article was very well written. As an opinion piece, you did a great job showing your side of the story in a way that makes me completely agree with your opinion. I also believe that Berkeley, a University well known for its reputable alumni and brilliant students, should find a speaker who doesn’t make arrogant generalizations and someone who is sophisticated enough to speak to a crowd of Berkeley students and faculty.
Bill Maher may be many things Yasmeen … outlandish, irreverent even rude, no wait, profane at times, but he’s one of the last people I can imagine anyone referring to as a racist. 
While I don’t disagree with you that many here in the U.S. and the West have become obsessed with Islamophobia since 9/11, stifling a guy like Maher because he said something that got under your skin hardly qualifies you to defend the right of free speech everywhere. Did you attend his show at USC last year? I wonder how many of the students who did would agree with your tightly wrapped assessment of the guy.
Keep in mind for instance, that I think Mitch McConnell the soon-to-be U.S. Senate majority leader is a dope, especially after he instructed his comrades in the Senate a few years ago to make defeating everything Mr. Obama asked for their top priority. Does that make McConnell a racist because Obama’s black or just stupid?
McConnell’s entitled to his opinion even if I do think he’s an idiot. But if his followers don’t think he’s racist they’re the fools, aren’t they … or is it us for putting a convenient label on something we don’t like ourselves?
Same with Maher. The guy’s a comic … an often causticly opinionated guy who perhaps does need to realize he’s going to offend some at times with his words. But having been a long-time viewer and Maher fan (my bias of course), I applaud the guy for having discussions on his show with guests that no one else is willing to even come near or consider inviting.
And for what it’s worth, having watched his show on the night that started all this craziness for the Berkeley bunch , I think you’re taking his words out of context, especially since the argument only really grew heated once Ben Affleck – another known hothead – jumped into the middle of it all to focus on one or two of Maher’s responses. I wonder how many of the students at Berkeley even watched the show that night, or how many of your readers did. 
Free speech is about listening to people you don’t agree with and spending time to check the facts before forming an opinion. Way too often these days, I find people on both sides going off the deep end with only half a bag of facts themselves.

The point of having a speaker is to create an engaging and thought-provoking dialogue. If the speaker isn’t going to say anything that’s in the least bit controversial, then what’s the point of them speaking? If you disagree with Bill Maher, listen to him and think about what he says to strengthen your own beliefs. That’s the point of living in a society with free speech. Otherwise we’ll end up hearing the same things and thinking the same things.
Robert,
What you write is not true for Muslims.  For Islam any and all questioning is to be quashed.  This is why there is not ONE SINGLE Muslim nation where freedom of speech or freedom of the press is allowed in anything approaching a robust fashion.
Yasmeen, you are in America now.  We do not want to become like any of the Muslim nations where individual freedoms are repressed or non-existent.  If you do not like our freedoms then I’m sorry but we’re not going to change them to suit you or Islam.
