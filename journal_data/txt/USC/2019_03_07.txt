Over 20 student organizations and student leaders from across USC released a statement Thursday to show support for the victims of former campus doctors George Tyndall and Dennis Kelly and demand the University to take accountability. 
“We are deeply ashamed of USC’s inability to fully address and take fault in the sexual assault allegations that have scarred our entire community,” the statement read. “It is appalling that our university has consistently muffled the voices of students despite riding the coattails of students’ accomplishments and diversity.”
Asian Pacific American Student Assembly director Joy Shin, who worked with advocacy chair Richelle Caday to draft the statement, said that after attending events like the Feb. 20 solidarity rally and Feb. 27 Engemann Town Hall, where students had the opportunity to voice their concerns to USC officials and push for change, she felt that students weren’t being heard. 
“We didn’t want student voices to be ignored, and we were really baffled at the fact that any university could do this and not take fault,” said Shin, a senior majoring in social sciences economics. “Our university just cares more about its image than the safety of its students, so … we decided to take initiative because we were really appalled at the situation.”
Caday, a sophomore majoring in psychology and non-governmental organizations and social change, said that once the statement was drafted, they reached out to other assemblies such as the Queer and Ally Student Assembly, Latinx Student Assembly, Environmental Student Assembly and Black Student Assembly forco-sponsors.
The statement includes a list of nine demands for the University, including providing rape kits on campus, funding monthly transparency meetings and town halls for students and involving students in the staff hiring process. Shin said she has been working with Undergraduate Student Government President Debbie Lee to plan how to move forward with these demands. Shin plans to present the ideas at a USG Senate meeting and to University officials who can help create change. 
Caday said she wants to communicate and work with University leaders and administrators to ensure that the demands are met. 
“All of these things are things that are doable that the administration can do,” Caday said. “We’re not asking for a complete radical change of the University, it’s just … little changes that will go a long way in how USC’s campus culture is right now.”
Shin said she hopes the statement helps victims and other students see that there are leaders on campus working for them. 
“[I thought] it would be really important to let survivors know that even though our university clearly doesn’t prioritize safety, there are people who do and will be working on your behalf to make sure that this university can be something that we’re proud of for years to come,” Shin said.

Professor Enrique Martinez Celaya hosted his second art history lecture Wednesday night at his art studio in Culver City. The lecture, which is a part of a series titled “The Lecture Project,” invites historians, writers and philosophers to discuss the connection between ethics and art. Curated by Celaya, the series is done in collaboration with USC to debate the responsibilities that art and criticism have in modern day society.  
“The lecture project idea comes partly because at the moment a lot of artists and art studios feel disconnected from the [art] conversation,” said Celaya, who is a Provost professor of arts and humanities at the Dornsife College for Arts and Sciences. 
Wednesday night’s lecture, “Shaping and Controlling an Artistic Reputation: Edvard Munch’s Dilemma,” saw writer Elizabeth Prelinger discussing the reputation of Munch, after he painted his famous work, “The Scream.” Prelinger has written numerous book reviews and has lectured all throughout the world, including in countries such as France, the U.K. and Canada on subjects ranging from Abstraction to 19th and 20th century art. She is also a curator, having exhibitions at places such as Harvard’s Fogg Art Museum and the National Gallery of Art. She is also a professor of art history and modern art at Georgetown University. 
Munch was a Norwegian painter, most known for his painting “The Scream” in 1893, which has since been seen to symbolize the anxiety and despair in man. Munch painted four versions of “The Scream;” one is currently on display at the National Gallery and two are at the Munch Museum in Oslo, Norway. And the fourth was sold in a private auction for nearly $120 million dollars. Most of his artwork surrounded themes that were shocking for the time, including references depression and death. 
Ultimately, it was his scandalous work and negative criticism that made him famous. 
“His work [was] very popular and very sellable. Partially among very advanced German collectors,” Prelinger said. “Later in his career he became interested in lighter colors and brushwork. And he was interested in the French master Henri Matisse … There was a whole Norwegian … community in Paris but when the war started they had to go home.”
Munch’s later work was defined by landscapes and lighter colors, mostly holding more French influence, especially as the Nazi populations began to spread throughout Europe. Prelinger sought to discuss Munch’s later legacy after the war, especially since most of his work was banned in Germany, even though most of his artwork survived the time. 
“[Munch sought to reference] his homeland during a time when war was being waged down south in Europe,” she said. “For Nazis, culture was important as a way of controlling society. They tried to control what was shown to the public or owner by museums.”
Munch was still a very famous successful artist both during after his time, and there were even a few secret Nazis who admired his work, writing letters on how beautifully Munch seemed to address life in his art. Preminger left the audience discussing the special place Munch found himself in: To have so much of his work be spared during a period in which the work of his peers was being sold and burned. 
“‘The Lecture Project’ is to talk about the relationship between art and ethics which is not really addressed in most series that museums or galleries do or universities do,” Celaya said. “[Asking] what is your ethical position in relationship to your work, [and] how do you see that relationship occuring … I wanted to have a studio being not only a palace where you make art but where theses dialogues can occur.”

The national anthem echoes throughout the stadium as athletes line up to race. For junior Anna Cockrell, standing still before she’s about to run is never an option. Instead, she showcases another equally impressive talent that hasn’t yet won her a world championship — singing.  
“If the national anthem plays, I’m going to sing along,” Cockrell said. “What do you want me to do? Just stand there?”
She was born with a powerful voice that her high energy and extroverted nature won’t silence. 
As a hurdler and relay runner for the USC women’s indoor and outdoor track and field team, Cockrell is a proven champion and leader. But she has only continued to demand more of herself. 
Growing up
Cockrell was born in San Francisco and spent her childhood moving between North Carolina, Maryland and Michigan, before settling down for high school in Waxhaw, North Carolina. Throughout all the moving around, one part of the Cockrell family remained constant: an emphasis on education. 
Their dinner placemats had the presidents of the United States and state capitals listed, and bedtime consisted of prayer and an educational component, like teaching the kids to spell their names. As they grew older, watching “Meet the Press” and “60 Minutes” every Sunday was a Cockrell family tradition, and Anna took naturally to politics. At 10 years old, she was a faithful reader of the Wall Street Journal. 
“It was just to always be aware of what’s going on in your country and how laws and what happens in politics determines what happens in the world,” Cockrell’s mother Serena said. “The more aware you are of what’s going on, the better decisions you can make.”
Cockrell read anything and everything she could, from books to online articles. The three Cockrell children would sit at the kitchen table and do homework every night, and even as the youngest sibling, Cockrell knew everyone’s answers. Her older brother and eventual Duke University graduate, Ross, would ask her the definitions of words and consult her on comma placements. 
“She was a walking encyclopedia,” Serena said. 
Despite constantly reading, Cockrell was always more of an auditory learner, picking up piano by ear and only fooling her parents into thinking she could read sheet music. She thrived in voice lessons, devoted time to musical theatre and even studied classical semi-operatic Italian music for a short time. 
And she was just as physically active as she was mentally, always running around and never sitting still. 
“She’s the bulldozer in the family with the biggest heart,” Serena said.
At first, people might not recognize the truth in this paradox, but to anyone who spends time with Cockrell, it’s obvious. 
“She can come across as tough, but she really is very soft inside,” Cockrell’s father Keith said without hesitation. “She might seem intimidating because of her stature and her performance in the classroom and on the track, but the reality is she has the biggest heart imaginable.”
Competing for USA
Cockrell’s foundation in education translated well into her athletic career. According to her high school coach and now-close friend Carol Lawrence, the desire to learn separates Cockrell from other athletes. 
“She’s one of those persons that’s a student of her event,” Lawrence said. “She doesn’t just go and do, she actually learns what she needs to do to get better at that event. She’ll study her own skill and she’ll study other people just to get that one fix to make herself a little bit better.” 
Lawrence felt like she could push Cockrell all the way to the world stage. 
“She was one of the few persons I’ve ever coached that, if I tell her what I’d like, she would look at [me] deeply, and [I] can see the wheels turning,” Lawrence said. “She will analyze everything you tell her, and she would fix it right there and then.”
This led Cockrell onto the USA Under-20 team in 2016, where she won the world championship for 400-meter hurdles in Poland.
“[Lawrence] just had a huge vision for what she wanted me to do,” Cockrell said. “It wasn’t good enough to be a state champion, wasn’t good enough to be a national champion. As soon as I got with her my freshman year, we were going for USA teams.” 
The national team was carefully composed of women all over the country, some who had competed against Cockrell and others she had never met. But that didn’t stop her natural leadership skills from shining through. Cockrell’s loud voice, kind personality and undeniably contagious smile broke the awkward silence among the new group. She introduced herself to anyone she hadn’t known and made a point to have dinner with the long-distance runners. She made people feel comfortable, a trait that would earn her captain honors of the USA world championship team and eventually USC’s national title team. 
Cockrell is unapologetic about her dominant personality — she knows she can apply it positively.
“I just don’t do well being quiet,” Cockrell said. 
Training as a Trojan
In her first 400-meter hurdle competition for USC, Cockrell took the fourth spot on the school’s all-time list and set a freshman school record. She set another freshman school record for 60-meter hurdles in the NCAA championships at the end of the year and took second in 400-meter hurdles, finishing the season with Pac-12 Women’s Freshman of the Year and All-American honors. 
She decorated her sophomore year with an indoor national championship — a feat barely accomplished but nonetheless entirely deserved. 
“It was the most emotional three days of life — ever,” Cockrell emphasized. 
She competed in 100-meter hurdles, 400-meter hurdles and 4×400-meter relay. With four athletes in the 100-meter hurdles, USC expected to advance two runners into the finals, if not all four. But none of them made it past the first day. 
From that moment, everything seemed to fall apart. Their opportunities for points were limited from the start, and they had worked out what would need to happen to win it all, but it just didn’t seem feasible at that point. Until Mady Richards, now graduated, swung the momentum in the Trojans’ favor by placing in long jump and surprising those who had calculated the possible outcomes. 
At the end of the third day, the 2018 women’s outdoor national title came down to one race: the 4×400-meter relay. 
“We knew we were hands down the best team out there,” Cockrell said. “It was going to be a fight, but we knew if we could all just do our job … we were going to be fine.” 
USC’s competition had strategically stacked their fastest runners early to build a lead that would be impossible for sprinter Kendall Ellis, who graduated in 2018, to overcome in the last leg of the race. Cockrell received the baton from current junior Kyra Constantine before running her best leg all season. With a solid hand-off to sprinter Deanna Hill, Cockrell collapsed onto the grass, confident that they had clinched it based off Hill’s positioning. 
But before she could start celebrating, Hill and Ellis bobbled the baton in the hand-off, putting Ellis far behind the other schools’ final leg runners. Cockrell began crying on the track as she watched the national title escape. 
Until it didn’t. Through her tears, Cockwell saw Ellis make an aggressive cut on Kentucky, and she realized Ellis had a chance.
She didn’t know what would happen until mid-way through the back stretch when she was sure Ellis was about to win it. And this time, she had it right. 
The three minutes, 27 seconds and 45 milliseconds of emotional chaos that it took to cross the finish line and clinch the national championship was representative of the rainy, freezing cold rollercoaster they had ridden throughout the meet. 
“It was just exhausting in the best possible way,” Cockrell said. “It was really special and something I’ll never forget.”
As a junior, Cockrell is in her second season as USC’s captain. While her admirable relatability to her teammates hasn’t changed, her leadership role has shifted. Being elected captain as a sophomore was the ultimate recognition and an honor that she didn’t take lightly — for Cockrell, it meant an opportunity for growth. 
“It was kind of finding the balance,” Cockrell said of her sophomore season. “Yes, I am the captain. But how do I act as a captain without going too far and without making the juniors and seniors, who have been around longer than me, [feel] uncomfortable?”
She took more of a backseat and let the tough words that needed to be said fall to the senior captains. This year, Cockrell is stepping into the role she’s accustomed to as an active and vocal leader, but she’s still working on finding a way to help her teammates acknowledge a mistake and realize it’s not the end of the world. 
“Some leaders have to yell, but she doesn’t have to,” sophomore hurdler and sprinter Chanel Brissett said. “She’ll pull you to the side and have a conversation with you, and you’ll get what she says.”
When she’s not singing and clapping to pump her teammates up, Cockrell thinks about her intersectional identity as a woman of color and athlete at USC. She makes a point to attend other women’s athletic events on campus and talk to female athletes about their season and training. 
“I want all women’s sports to get their due, to get coverage, respect [and] monetary compensation,” Cockrell said. “I don’t know how I’m able to affect that at this point, but [I’m] just putting myself out there, expressing my ideas and lifting up my teammates and other women.”
Future feats
Cockrell’s interest in politics never wavered throughout high school, where she participated in Get Out the Vote initiatives and voter registration drives, inspiring her to become a communication major and political science minor at USC. She discovered more about the field when she volunteered on Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s re-election campaign and Marshall Tuck’s campaign for California state superintendent. 
“I like interacting with people,” Cockrell said. “It’s kind of annoying to call people and be in peoples’ face, but it’s fun at the same time.” 
Even though Cockrell matriculated at USC with dreams of becoming the next Rachel Maddow, she decided to take her planning and people skills into forward-facing politics where she can interact with both candidates and constituents.
“If I need to talk about anything politics with [Anna], I need to do research first,” Lawrence said. “I have to do research on any topic before I mention anything to her, because she is so sharp that it’s scary. She’s so intellectual.”
After finishing her bachelor’s degree this semester, she will go on to graduate school in the Price School for Public Policy, finishing out her collegiate track career with one more year before, ideally, running professionally. 
“I’m at the point where I really want to listen to my body and run for as long as it makes sense and it makes me happy,” Cockrell said. “We’ll see what my body and my mind want to do.”
Cockrell hopes for the fairytale ending — running in three Olympics and calling it a career when the Games return to L.A. in 2028. Judging by her track record in achieving goals, 2028 seems entirely possible. 
“Anna’s one of the most disciplined people that you’ll come across,” Keith said. “To this day, she writes her goals on a whiteboard at the start of every year.”
After making some money on the circuit, she wants to retire her athletic career and work in politics. Even when Cockrell’s muscles have been overworked and given out, her warmth, kindness and dominant voice will carry her strengths to new fields and heights.
“She has all the time in the world,” Lawrence said. “There’s so much more to her life right now than just track.”

Coming off a tough overtime loss to UCLA last Thursday, men’s basketball looks to bounce back in its upcoming road trip against Utah and Colorado. The close UCLA matchup concluded with a time-expiring 3-pointer that put the game out of reach for the Trojans despite a strong 3-point shooting effort.
“We are trying to look at the positive things that we did right to build momentum [off of the UCLA game],” senior forward Bennie Boatwright said. “We are going to keep getting better.”
The Trojans will first travel to Utah to face the Utes on Thursday at 7 p.m. Utah is currently one game ahead of USC in the crowded Pac-12 standings, and a win could put them in the top portion of the conference. 
Utah, which most recently lost at home to Colorado, will rely heavily on senior guard Sedrick Barefield. Barefield leads the Utes with 16.8 points, 3.9 assists and one steal per game. He put up 19 points against the Buffaloes and 33 points against Washington State in his last two games. 
USC will have to be much more aggressive on the defensive end in this matchup, as they fell last time the two  teams met by a score of 77-70. Utah showcased a strong first-half effort and continually dictated the pace of play on offense, helping the Utes to find the open man through patient passing and limiting the number of Trojan possessions. 
USC will face off against Colorado in its final game of the season Saturday. The Trojans also lost to the Buffaloes the last time they played by a score of 69-65. Colorado dominated USC on the glass, out-rebounding them 38-29. Additionally, USC only shot 29.2 percent from the 3-point range.
The Trojans hope for strong performances from their two seniors, who had noteworthy games the last time they played Colorado. Boatwright had a commanding all-around performance, putting up 24 points, five rebounds and four assists. Guard Shaqquan Aaron contributed 13 points of his own, involving himself in many crucial plays. 
Colorado is one of the eight teams in the Pac-12 that are currently separated by fewer than three games. This final matchup may be crucial for the Trojans because of this, as USC could either rise or fall significantly in the standings heading into the Pac-12 tournament. If the Trojans perform well in both games, they will have a chance at receiving the bye that is granted to the top four seeds. 
If the Trojans are successful this weekend, they could set themselves up for a strong performance in the upcoming Pac-12 tournament. USC will first travel to Utah for a 7 p.m. matchup on Thursday before facing Colorado Saturday at 2 p.m.

Friends and family, it’s almost World Cup season.
I’ve been dreading those words for the last three years, and with the culmination of the She Believes Cup this week — in which the U.S. soccer team took second place — I felt a new sense of dread settle in.
If you had asked me in 2015, the story would be different, of course. Back then, I was young and naïve. The pain of the 2011 World Cup finals had faded from my memory, and I had yet to experience the suffering of the Olympics quarterfinal loss to Sweden. At the time, I felt indestructible. American soccer was the best of the best, too good to be touched — even in the World Cup finals.
(A quick note: Most times, it’s necessary to differentiate between men’s and women’s sports. That’s not the case in U.S. international soccer and will remain that way until the men’s national team actually succeeds in qualifying for … literally anything.) 
Now, however, I don’t feel as sure. Four years ago, the U.S. cruised through the World Cup finals to a 5-2 finish that felt almost surreal in its dominance. But since then, it seems as if everything has fallen a bit apart.
To be fair, there were signs from the beginning. Although the team’s final match was impressive, its World Cup run was not perfect, and much of the blame for the team’s idiosyncrasies was placed on one person — head coach Jill Ellis. It followed, then, that the blame after the team’s early outing from the Olympics continued to put more pressure on Ellis. This year, the World Cup could serve as a last straw — a final chance for the coach to either prove herself or prove the necessity of finding a new leader for the team.
One of the unique qualities of any international team is the difference between an on and an off year. The U.S. soccer team has two on years — the World Cup and the Olympics — and two off years in every four-year cycle. During the on years, the entire team is plunged into a top level of celebrity, gaining headlines and broadcast spots on a daily basis. Fans and casual viewers turn out in droves for watch parties and follow the sport with regularity.
But in the off years, the team operates in virtual obscurity. It’s easy for a handful of friendly games to pass without any casual viewers noticing, and only the golazos make it onto SportsCenter highlight reels. Because of this, it’s easier for coaches and players to outlast mistakes and failures.
In many ways, this has been a blessing for U.S. soccer. After the early Olympics loss, the team faded into the background of American sports, ranked far below the top sports of football and men’s basketball in the country’s narrow attention span. So the team was able to lick its wounds and get down to the painstaking work of finding — and fixing — the fatal flaws of that loss in relative peace and quiet.
That peace and quiet has lasted for almost three years, although it has begun to fade as the team nears the World Cup. And although there are a few newcomers to the squad, the mainstays of this year’s squad — Rapinoe, Heath, Lloyd, Morgan, Press — are as familiar now as they were four years ago in Vancouver.
Yet there’s a difference in the feel of this World Cup year. Four years ago, the focus of the team and its branding was on the mission for the third star, a symbol of the third World Cup win for America. That focus shaped the entire mentality of the team and its fans, mainly because it was as focused on the past as it was on the future. 
2015 was about 2011. It was about revenge and redemption. It was about winning back what had been lost in the last World Cup, proving any doubt or hate wrong. It was about overcoming a hurdle that the team hadn’t overcome since 1999, and in that sense, the team’s ferocious dedication to this mission made the result feel almost inevitable, and the team invincible.
Now, of course, we know that this team isn’t invincible. We know that even our stars can be subdued and that our head coach might not always know best. As fans, we’ve seen that this team can be beaten. That’s why, more than ever, this year will be the ultimate testing ground for them, and for Ellis in particular.
Ellis succeeded in 2015 off the sheer tenacity of her team, then floundered with one of the most highly talented rosters the U.S. has ever produced in 2016. With mere months left before the World Cup, she has yet to settle on a starting goalkeeper, and she is still toying with lineups with no clear plan of attack for the coming World Cup.
For Ellis, this year will be make or break. That’s the problem with the ebb and flow of American interest in international soccer — the team only has an audience when it’s playing for the highest stakes. If she fails again on the world stage, there’s a low likelihood that fans will be willing to risk a three-peat in Tokyo. And if the U.S. finds itself out before the semis again, Ellis should prepare to start job hunting again.

For many college students, four years of school can seem to fly by quickly. For student-athletes, grueling workouts, travel and the rigors of competing at the Division I level can make it go by even quicker. In this series, the Daily Trojan sits down with senior athletes playing various sports at USC to discuss their experience over the past four years, from their athletic life to their academic life. This week’s senior is women’s cross country and track runner Amber Gore, one of USC’s top distance runners over the last four seasons.
WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE MEMORY AT USC?
Every year has been super memorable. There’s always new people coming in and making the team feel like a giant family. One of my favorite memories was my freshman year when we had the dual meet at UCLA. As a freshman, I knew about the rivalry coming in, but didn’t know about the deep history behind it. Being able to sweep on the men’s and women’s side at UCLA was just an unforgettable experience that really set the tone for the next three years and makes me excited to repeat it each year.  
WHAT HAVE YOU HAD TO SACRIFICE IN ORDER TO BE A STUDENT-ATHLETE, ESPECIALLY PLAYING TWO SPORTS?
Cross country is in the fall and track is in the winter and spring. It essentially feels like a big, year-round sport. Because I run distance in track, the training doesn’t change very much. We incorporate a little more speed in the spring. I’ve definitely learned how to work on time management because I notice I have a lot less time than other students to do schoolwork and extracurricular things. But it’s all for the love of the sport, and I wouldn’t trade it at all.
WHAT IS YOUR SCHEDULE LIKE?
We start with morning practice as early as 6 a.m. And then recovery, breakfast and then I go to class. I come back for an afternoon session which can consist of another mini practice or weightlifting. Sometimes more class, and I go home and do homework — and then the day starts all over the next day.
WHAT’S ONE THING ABOUT RUNNING THAT MOST PEOPLE DON’T KNOW?
People don’t understand how much mental focus it requires. A lot of people don’t like running as it is. I think the best part about running is when you get in that flow state. You are just in the zone. You feel great, like you’re floating through the air. It gives me a lot of time to think about anything. My mind can just wander. I feel great afterward, always. That’s the most important thing.
DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR FRESHMAN ATHLETES?
Use all the resources that we have at USC, whether that be your teammates, your coaches, teachers, the athletic staff or the academic faculty. Everyone is here to see you succeed, and I wish I would have taken advantage of that at an earlier time. There are so many people that can offer you so many things at school. I came in thinking that I can be super self-sufficient and definitely struggled at times. So I want to encourage younger athletes that it’s okay to reach out. It doesn’t mean you’re weak, or you can’t figure things out. It just means that sometimes we all need a little bit of extra help.

The Bechdel test and its rules were first featured in the comic strip “Dykes to Watch Out For,” written by Alison Bechdel in 1985. In this strip, two women discuss films, and one of them tells the other her criteria for going out and seeing a movie: The movie has to have at least two women in it who talk to each other about something other than a man.
The films in the following list are included not only because they align with these guidelines, which have become a popular litmus test for feminist film buffs, but also because they go beyond this bare minimum. The women in these films have interesting jobs and interests that go beyond romance. And while part of their stories may be about finding love (with a man or otherwise), in these cases, that’s far from the most compelling thing about them.
You’ve Got Mail (1998)
Directed by Nora Ephron, written by Nora and Delia Ephron
Based on the Hungarian play “Parfumerie,” Nora Ephron’s “You’ve Got Mail” is centered around Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan), the owner of a children’s bookstore, and Joe Fox (Tom Hanks), the head of Fox and Sons Books, a large bookstore chain threatening Kelly’s business. Despite their professional rivalry and seemingly extreme moral differences, Fox and Kelly connect and fall in love over email chats with the screen names “NY152”  and “Shopgirl.” The thing is, neither knows they’ve been talking to their sworn enemy. “You’ve Got Mail” takes viewers on a nostalgic trip to simpler days when online dating didn’t require any swiping.
The movie passes the Bechdel test because it focuses on Kathleen running her mother’s bookstore, with the unique pressure of not only trying to sustain the business but also her mother’s legacy. When she is at a professional crossroads, she seeks council from one of her mother’s old friends, Birdie. 
Love & Basketball (2000)
Written and directed by Gina 
Prince-Bythewood
This romantic sports film follows the interweaving lives of Monica (Sanaa Lathan) and Quincy (Omar Epps), as they both pursue their dreams to be basketball players. As Monica progresses in her basketball career, she also faces challenges controlling her demeanor and temper, constantly getting penalized on the court. Monica also butts heads with her mother’s expectations of her femininity, pushing her to be less of a tomboy and embrace a traditionally domestic role. 
The film challenges expectations placed on women to exhibit traditionally feminine qualities, and Monica tries to pursue her own athletic ambition in a time when female athletes weren’t as accepted or celebrated (not to mention the infancy of WNBA). She also  challenges familial and societal expectations to be a certain type of woman.
Kissing Jessica Stein (2001)
Written by Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen
“Kissing Jessica Stein” is about two women with very different personalities experiencing sexual frustration who end up finding themselves in love with each other. Jessica (Westfeldt), a neurotic copy editor and aspiring painter, is frustrated after a string of bad dates with men who continually disappoint her. Helen (Juergensen) works at an art gallery and finds herself at a sexual crossroads after stringing along three men in casual relationships. The two women meet after Helen puts an ad in the paper looking for a female friend (plus a little extra). Jessica is hesitant at first, but as she loosens up over time, they grow as a pair. 
The co-stars wrote the film as an adaptation of a scene from their own 1997 play “Lipschtick.” Helen helps Jessica break out of some of her anxious tendencies while Jessica helps Helen discover a new, more thoughtful kind of intimacy. 
Real Women Have Curves (2002)
Written by Josefina López and George LaVoo
“Real Women Have Curves” explores the life of Ana García (USC alumna America Ferrera), an 18-year-old navigating two very different worlds: Her life at Beverly Hills High School with her posh classmates and her economically unstable life at home with her immigrant parents. She grapples with wanting to pursue a personal life and interests that differ from her domineering and critical mother’s expectations, including applying to college in New York City. 
Ana establishes her own identity on her own terms. She not only lifts herself up, but also tries to help her family and the other women she works with in the factory succeed. Ana gives her family ideas on how to keep their business running, and along with her co-workers, she discovers a new acceptance for their varying body types.
Mistress America (2015)
Written by Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach
Set in New York, this film follows Brooke (Gerwig) and Tracy (Lola Kirke), who connect because their parents are getting married and they’ll soon be stepsisters. Tracy is a new student at Barnard College and wants to be a writer. She applies to her school’s literary society but isn’t accepted. She expresses her frustration to Brooke, who commiserates and shares her own (at times, very scattered) creative interests and pursuits, including opening up her own restaurant. Without revealing too much, the antics pulled, the finger-pointing and reuniting of old friends and acquaintances make for perfectly awkward tension and humor in this film.
In addition to being co-written by pre-“Lady Bird” Greta Gerwig, the film passes the Bechdel test because it showcases the (non-romantic) ambitions of two women in different stages of their lives.

Back when my dinners were speckled with Kraft parmesan cheese and packets of Heinz ketchup, I thought my grandmother’s cooking was the best in the world. Her chicken noodle soup, dancing with pearls of oil and Maggi sauce, was leagues above the kind I had that come out of cans. Her cucumber salad, composed of thinly shredded cucumber, dill and a thin cream dressing was beyond compare. To this day, I crave her egg noodles, cooked in a pan with butter and bread crumbs, dressed in a gravy made of roasted chicken drippings and Knorr soup powder. To me, and to the millions of people who echo this notion, my grandmother’s cooking was the best.
Maternal cooking has, for millenia, been associated with comfort and nourishment. Our childhood memories are spotted with home-cooked meals from our mothers, grandmothers or other female relatives. From our very conception as human beings, in our first days of life, we cherish our mothers’ abilities to provide. Until recently, it was expected for a woman to be phenomenal in the kitchen — the perfect housewife creating restaurant-ready dishes. It seems natural that the best restaurants would be crafted by this same expectation of feminine culinary prowess. 
Which is why, once I finally began eating outside my sheltered city, I was surprised by how male chefs have historically dominated the industry. 
Restaurants have developed several methods of halting women from progress — sexual harassment and assault, the inclination to give female chefs a pastry position and harsher criticism in and out of the kitchen are all frequent issues. Only an estimated 5 percent of chefs in the United States are women. Only a third of “Chef’s Table” features are on women, and even fewer are on women of color. Only about 4 percent of all Michelin stars are awarded to women. In fact, the first woman in the United States to win a three-star rating was Dominique Crenn four months ago. 
However, in Los Angeles, a county of diversity and liberal attitudes, more and more women are able to demonstrate their abilities in the kitchen. 
In a gelatinous sea of male chefs during the 1980s, Nancy Silverton cut through them like a knife. Starting as a pastry chef in Los Angeles staple Spago, Silverton shone with talent and skill. Less than a decade later, she opened Campanile with her partner Mark Peel, where she continued to grow as a chef, releasing several cookbooks and pioneering La Brea Bakery. Now, Campanile’s building houses another formidable pastry chef, Margarita Manzke. Silverton now owns Osteria Mozza, Pizzeria Mozza and Chi Spacca (ostensibly nicknamed the “Mozzaplex”). Along with chefs Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken of Border Grill in 1985, as well as Caroline Stein and Suzanne Goin (owners of A.O.C, Luques and Tavern) in the early 2000s, the growth of Los Angeles’ food scene was encouraged and revitalized.
Outside the wealthy circles of Los Angeles, women also revolutionized expectations for ethnic cuisine. In 2006, Jazz Singsanong and her brother, Tui Sungkamee, revamped the classic Jitlada with dishes from southern Thailand that burst with flavor and heat. Singsanong continues to serve its signature mussels and crispy catfish in a restaurant vibrant with life. Beverly Soon Tofu has been a Koreatown establishment since 1986, when Monica Lee first began serving bubbling pots of soon tofu soup. It, like many other places in Koreatown, is open 24 hours and is abuzz at all hours of the day and night. 
Sara Kramer and Sarah Hymanson have quickly built a reputation as some of the best new chefs in Los Angeles after the meteoric success of Kismet, fresh off following their equally-successful Madcapra in Grand Central Market (now renamed Kismet Falafel). Their menus consist of exciting, revitalized blends of California cuisine and Middle Eastern classics, served all day. 
Pastry, a realm formerly relegated to women because of its “daintier” aspects, is also being revolutionized at the helm of several female chefs. Leslie Mialma creates pastries for the hip restaurant Winsome, often using alternative grains and unique flavor combinations. Zoe Nathan of Rustic Canyon and Huckleberry has earned a reputation for her business ingenuity and fantastic desserts, with ventures into ice cream at Sweet Rose Creamery as well as other westside establishments including Cassia, Milo and Olive and Tallulah’s. 
While men still comprise the majority of chefs in Los Angeles, women have cornered the market on breakfast and lunch. Perhaps the most famous brunch spot of the city is Sqirl, constantly flooded with Angelenos and tourists waiting for a taste of its Ricotta Toast, lathered with seasonal Sqirl jams, or its Pesto Sorrel Rice Bowl, colorful and tangy with fermentation. Ria Barbosa, formerly a chef at Sqirl and Go Get Em Tiger, incorporates Filipino flavors into delicious brunch dishes at Paramount Coffee Project.
Dinner in Los Angeles, while less populated, is still home to several astounding female chefs. Niki Nakayama of N/Naka has created a wholly unique experience — her intricate kaiseki dinners are booked months in advance. With her restaurant heralded as one of the best in the world, Niki has been a semifinalist for the Best Chef in America James Beard Award two years in a row and was featured on the first season of “Chef’s Table” (with Nancy Silverton and Dominique Crenn also being featured on the show, California now boasts the most female chefs featured). 
Los Angeles owes a large part of its status as a culinary destination to women. While there is still progress to be made, like incorporating more diverse voices in the culinary scene, the last decade has seen a shift toward the fresh and exciting palates women chefs have to offer. And it’s no surprise that women are as talented as men in the kitchen; outside the restaurant world, women are still largely responsible for cooking in their households. Right now, in Los Angeles, where women are rewarded for their effort against the overwhelming male presence in the industry, there is a promising shift toward progress.

Four years ago as a sophomore in high school, Megan Winsor spent her Saturday afternoons in her room at her Newport Beach home, strumming her guitar, playing her piano and scribbling song lyrics. 
Today, Winsor, a sophomore music major at USC, has turned those scribbles into a musical career. Last Friday, she released her third single, “Lose Myself,” an alternative and Americana mix about a heartbreaker who falls in love. 
“[Lose Myself] is one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever written,” Winsor said. “So [the heartbreaker’s] like, ‘I don’t know what to do with myself. I’m losing myself.’ I’m super excited for everyone to hear it.”
Winsor released her first song and music video, “Caught up!,” inspired by her high school experiences. The track fits into the soft pop genre and describes her emotions during high school.
“I started writing [the song] when I was a sophomore in high school,” Winsor said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “This was right when I was looking into colleges, and I started to get caught up in the drama. And I wrote that song about … me being an emotional teenager.”
She finished writing the song as a high school senior and managed to secure an artist development deal with DNT Entertainment in Anaheim.
DNT Entertainment connected Winsor to Phil Allen, an associate professor of theatre practice in sound design at the School of Dramatic Arts, and they produced two singles together. 
This January, Winsor debuted her second single, called “Someone Else’s Car,” which was co-produced Allen, 
“[Someone Else’s Car] was the first [song] we did that was a venture … and it felt like the pop territory … a little more kind of ‘produced’ sounding,” Allen said. “There was a quite a bit of back and forth in really, really fine tuning … to how much of her artistic side there’s going to be shining through, and how much of it was going to be a little more on the marketable side.”
Winsor has been a passionate musician and songwriter, since she was 11 years old. At the age of 12, she wrote her first song, and her love for music composition has only grown since.
“My dad had this really old piano … and so I started to teach myself piano,” Winsor said. “I wrote my first song when I was 12 … [and] at that point, I was begging my parents for piano lessons.”
After that, Winsor began piano lessons, where her teacher taught her music theory for six years.
Since then, Winsor has learned how to play the piano, guitar and ukulele, as well as sing and produce music.
“As I’ve known her, [Megan’s] been growing into not just a songwriter, not just a performer, but a multi-instrumentalist,” Allen said. “She’s now producing her own music, and she’s sending it to me to help with the final tweaks, which is really cool because as the years have gone by, I’ve been able to seeing her really grow how to make entire songs herself as a producer.” 
Winsor spent her freshman year studying at the Berklee College of Music before transferring to USC. During that time, she explored her passion and tried to validate her career as a musician.
“I was living with a bunch of musicians and … I learned that it’s OK to be forward, and the only way you’re going to succeed is by being vocal about what you do and proud of what you do,” Winsor said. 
Winsor transferred to USC because she preferred the supportive community and proximity to the entertainment industry the university offered.
“I spent a lot of time inside last year when it was the winter, and I spent a lot of time writing and producing and really perfecting my craft,” Winsor said. “Here, I get to play a bunch of shows, I’ve played at The Viper Room, The State Social House … and there’s more of a music community here, which is awesome for me because I want to get my name in the community … and have my career here.”
Winsor attributes much of her success to USC’s friendly community and professors like Allen who have guided her through the music production process.
“What’s really cool about ’SC is that there’s so many people doing what they love here, and so coming here and meeting a wide array of people has been awesome to use their talents to help my talent and network,” Winsor said. 
Winsor produced her singles in recording studios with Allen, who is also a Grammy Award-winning producer.
“That was crazy. And then I shot a full-on music video, and I’ve never done that before,” Winsor said. “It’s just like they taught me that I can be a real artist.” 
Winsor also cited her parents as an integral part of her musical career.
“Without knowing anything in the industry, they’ve been there for me.” Winsor said. “You know, they’re letting me major in music in college, and most parents wouldn’t let their child do that.”
Allen said he enjoys working with Winsor due to their creative similarities. 
“She’s a great thinker, great musician but definitely one of the more creative kind of songwriter artists that I’ve ever worked with,” Allen said. “We had a really good time working together … we just really clicked in terms of the creative process.”
Dani Thompson, the CEO and founder of DNT Entertainment, said she was impressed with Winsor’s talent and work ethic.
“She continues to impress me with her undeniable talent in the areas of songwriting, live performance and music production, and her ability to accomplish anything she sets her mind to,” Thompson said an email to the Daily Trojan. “Her self-motivation, passion and vision has led her career to where it is today, and I am very proud to stand alongside her, as she steps into the spotlight to share her story and her music on a larger platform.”

Erick Guerrero, a former USC assistant professor who was placed on probation in Fall 2018 following an investigation of his alleged sexual harassment of a student, is no longer employed at the University as of Nov. 20, 2018, University Media Relations confirmed to the Daily Trojan.
Guerrero’s lawyer Mark Hathaway said Guerrero, who was an assistant professor at the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work resigned from the University. The Daily Trojan could not confirm this with USC. 
In October 2017, graduate student Karissa Fenwick filed a lawsuit against USC and Guerrero, accusing him of sexually harassing her in his hotel room during an academic conference. Guerrero also filed a libel lawsuit in October 2018 against 72 professors from the School of Social Work who publicly condemned him after the sexual harassment allegations surfaced. 
Hathaway and University Media Relations declined to comment on the status of the libel lawsuit. 
Fenwick said she was informed of Guerrero’s departure from USC through “underground gossip” rather than an official message from the University. While Fenwick said she understands the University must be careful with the information it releases concerning Guerrero due to the lawsuits at hand, she said that she and other students should have been informed that Guerrero would no longer be present on campus. 
“I would imagine that they could at least release something saying that he is no longer on the faculty [so] that students know that, because it wasn’t just me who became fearful seeing him around,” Fenwick said. 
Fenwick’s lawyer John Winer said he did not know why the University has not Guerrero’s departure publicly commented. 
“They owe it to Karissa to inform her, to let her feel safe and comfortable being on campus, and they haven’t done that because they won’t announce anything,” Winer said. “They’re keeping everything for some reason confidential.”
Fenwick was also a student member of a Sexual Harassment Task Force assembled in Fall 2017. Students, faculty and staff on the task force compiled a 49-page report with recommendations to improve the School of Social Work’s policies, procedures and communication regarding issues of harassment and discrimination.
But she said she hasn’t received many updates on the progress of the recommendations since the task force submitted its report in Spring 2018. 
“Many of us have been wondering what is happening with those, when are they being implemented and how,” Fenwick said. “It seems like the school just wants the whole thing to fizzle out, which I guess I can understand from their perspective, but it’s unsettling I think from some of ours.”
Carl Castro, an associate professor at the School of Social Work,who was also part of the task force, said changes have already begun, but communication was more consistent before the task force dissolved last spring. Back then, he said updates were routinely provided via email and on the task force website. 
“I just think we need a school-wide and University-wide campaign of communicating changes,” Castro said. “You can’t just say it once, you’ve got to say it multiple times, in multiple ways, in multiple venues.”
Tory Cox, assistant dean of field education at the Virtual Academic Center, also worked on the Sexual Harassment Task Force. Cox served as a co-chair for the Steering Committee, which guided the Environmental Culture Workgroup, Policy Workgroup and Assessment Workgroup. He also served as a liaison between the groups. 
Cox said that in preparation for the Fall 2019 semester, the School of Social Work updated its guidelines in business agreements with field organizations that graduate students work with to complete their required internship hours. These changes included measures to make students aware of harassment and discrimination policies at these internships and inform them on how to file a complaint.
He said field instructors, who supervise students during internships, also received training, which includes live sessions and a 30-minute video about the University’s expectations for harassment and discrimination policy and reporting. 
“We’ve done a nice, really thorough circle of what it takes in the field environment to make sure all parties are well-informed and that the process for filing a complaint is clearly delineated,” Cox said. 
Cox said these changes seemed necessary in light of recent sexual harassment allegations made on campus and complaints students made regarding their internships.
“We have students in every state doing internships, so the more spread out you get, the more important your policies and expectations are … so that agencies know where you’re coming from as an institution,” Cox said. 
Cox said the School of Social Work also sent out a school climate survey in January that included questions on sexual harassment and discrimination for students, faculty and staff. Its results are currently being compiled and will be used to identify more key issues the school must address.
The School of Social Work faculty also voted to add six extra pages to its Faculty Guidebook on sexual harassment and discrimination policies, which is waiting on University approval, according to Castro. 
“The idea of culture change is an important thing to recognize, that this is what the effort of the task was, to make sure that what had taken place previously would not take place again,” Cox said. 
Guerrero could not be reached for comment at the time of publication.

Approximately 50 students attended an interdisciplinary discussion on climate change and its impact hosted by the USC Sidney Harman Academy for Polymathic Study Wednesday. At the event, which is the third installation of the Spring 2019 Polymathic Pizza series, assistant professor of international relations Shannon Gibson, and assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering George Ban-Weiss spoke about how each of their fields is impacted by climate change.  
The event was moderated by Sidney Harman Academy Director Tara McPherson.
“This spring series is looking at big problems or hot-button issues in bringing together scholars from different methodologies and training for a conversation,” McPherson said.
According to the academy’s website, polymathy is utilizing a variety of interests and skills to innovate and solve problems. The Polymathic Pizza series pairs two professors from different fields in a discussion of critical issues facing society to highlight how various approaches and perspectives can come together to reach a solution.
“The Academy was created to give the very inquisitive, intellectually-curious students of USC a way to operate outside the confines of their discipline and think about how problems might be tackled across disciplinary divides using polymathic methods,” McPherson said.
Gibson and Ban-Weiss each gave 10-minute presentations on their research and approaches toward proposing solutions to climate change.
Gibson spoke about the effects of climate change on international politics. Citing Ban Ki-moon, the former secretary general of the United Nations, Gibson said that many issues facing the world are interconnected.
“Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth … these are one and the same fight,” Gibson said. “Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all.”
Gibson’s research studies the role societal participation plays in politics, primarily from her perspective as an environmentalist and activist. 
“One thing about me is that I’m a self-avowed scholar-activist,” Gibson said. “I consider myself an environmentalist, and I am a participant in a number of environmental NGOs.”
McPherson said she observed a distinction between two “societies” — civil and uncivil — which demonstrate the uneven effects of climate change on groups that suffer socially and economically. 
“A lot of these groups are already vulnerable to the effects of climate change,” Gibson said. “It was these groups that tend to suffer disproportionately from climate change who are often denied access to environmental benefits — things like clean water, sanitation — and are historically denied access to decision making.”
Ban-Weiss’ research uses field observations and quantitative models to study air pollution and climate change. Ban-Weiss said he tackles issues practically and locally rather than globally, since change on a massive scale is much harder to accomplish.
“The research that I do looks at climate change and air pollution but at a more local level — at the urban scale,” Ban-Weiss said. “The question is what can be done at a local level to actually affect the climate of your city.”
One aspect of Ban-Weiss’ research focuses on how materials used to construct urban buildings contribute to climate change. His team has proposed adopting “cool roofs,” which reflect sunlight instead of absorbing it and could reduce Los Angeles’ average temperature by one or two degrees Fahrenheit.
“Materials in cities, like asphalt pavements and rooftops, historically are very dark and absorb a lot of sunlight,” Ban-Weiss said. “Part of the research that I do is [explore], ‘In what ways can we brighten up materials?’”
Ban-Weiss said his polymathic endeavors include performing songs about the environment on bass in order to impact broader communities. 
“It’s a musical concert that has a song cycle, —[the band] refers to it as a ‘Love Letter to the Ocean,’” Ban-Weiss said. “It goes through different parts that are environmentally related.”
Following Ban-Weiss’ presentation, McPherson led a discussion about societal indifference toward climate change. Gibson said the indifference stems from the fact that western communities often don’t experience the effects of global warming firsthand.
“In the United States, in Europe, in certain places, we don’t necessarily see or feel the tangible effects of climate change because we are, [for the most part], very much disconnected from the ecosystem,” Gibson said.
Hana Craft, a junior majoring in psychology, said she found the event to be thought-provoking.
“It was really so profound to hear from people who have been working for years, even decades, toward understanding this topic and the ways that solutions may have negative impacts and positive impacts,” Craft said.
