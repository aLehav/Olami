It was a night of firsts for USC at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Thursday—the first Thursday night home game in the BCS era, the first game under interim head coach Ed Orgeron and, more importantly for the Trojans, their first conference victory of the season.
The Trojans used an explosive offensive performance and a bend-but-don’t-break defense en route to a 38-31 victory over Arizona. USC led throughout the entire game and appeared rejuvenated in Oregeron’s debut following the firing of former head coach Lane Kiffin.
USC (4-2, 1-2 Pac-12) was aggressive from the opening whistle, scoring twice in the first quarter and taking a 28-10 lead into halftime.

“I’m really proud of our team, the way they came out,” Orgeron said. “They came out and started fast, and I’m really proud of the coaching staff and leadership of our team.”
Arizona (3-2, 0-2) put a scare into the Trojan faithful by punching in two touchdowns in the fourth quarter to cut the lead to 38-31 with 4:37 remaining, but senior tailback Silas Redd acted as the closer in his season debut.
Redd trucked an Arizona defender on a key third-and-eight conversion to clinch the victory for USC. In the first half, Redd only played on the Trojans’ final drive before halftime, but seemed to get stronger as the game went on and finished with a team-high 80 yards on 19 carries.
“That was an honor,” Redd said of being the featured back at the end of the game. “I’m the old man in the bunch, and I’m just happy those guys believed in me and trusted me to get me in that situation.”
With junior wide receiver Marqise Lee sidelined with a sprained left knee, sophomore wide receiver Nelson Agholor became the Trojans’ primary offensive weapon, and the Tampa, Fla. native did not disappoint. Agholor finished the game with seven catches 161 yards—just one short of his career high– and one score that started the Trojans’ offensive onslaught in the first half.
A 62-yard pass from redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler to Agholor, who managed to reel in the long bomb with his fingertips, put USC on the scoreboard.
“Nelson is good,” wide receivers coach Tee Martin said. “The thing I like best about him is, when I congratulated him on how he played tonight, the first thing he said is, ‘Time to get back to work.’ That just sums it up for him. He’s a hard worker, and I like everything he does.”
In the days leading up to his first game as interim head coach, Orgeron was adamant that his main goal was for USC players to have fun and play with enthusiasm and energy. Thanks to the Trojans’ fast start and Orgeron’s constant encouragement, the team’s sideline was raucous all night, a stark contrast to Kiffin’s often reserved demeanor.
“It’s about the overall concept that ‘We care about the team,’” Orgeron said. “We tried to give the players a feeling of what it was like here under [former head coach Pete] Carroll. We did some motivational things that I thought were very good. I have to give credit to these players, they really bought it.”
Following Agholor’s touchdown, USC extended its lead with a 63-yard touchdown pass from Kessler to redshirt sophomore running back Tre Madden. Madden made multiple defenders miss on his way to the goal line and continued his strong start to the season. He finished the game with 91 total yards from scrimmage, but left late in the third quarter due to a hamstring injury.
After Arizona cut the lead to 14-3, a blocked punt gave the Trojans the ball at the Wildcats’ 42-yard line. USC went on a five play, 42-yard drive that was capped by an 11-yard touchdown run by freshman running back Justin Davis, who finished the game with 38 yards on nine carries and one touchdown.
The Trojans struck again after a seven play, 58-yard drive capped by a one-yard leap into the end zone by redshirt sophomore running back Javorius “Buck” Allen, the first of his career, giving USC a 28-3 lead.
The Wildcats had success moving the ball throughout the entire game, particularly in the passing attack. Arizona quarterback B.J. Denker, who had struggled throughout the season throwing the ball, finished the game with 28 completions on 44 attempts and set career highs with 363 yards and four touchdowns. Denker had averaged just 111.3 passing yards per game entering Thursday night. His 57-yard touchdown pass in the final minute of the second quarter made the score 28-10 at halftime.
Following a 45-yard field goal by junior kicker Andre Heidari midway through the third quarter, Arizona cut the lead to 31-17 after a 45-yard touchdown strike from Denker to wide receiver Garic Wharton. USC quickly responded with a nine play, 73-yard drive that was finished off by a four-yard touchdown run by Allen, giving the Trojansa 38-17 lead with 14:46 remaining in the game.
After Arizona scored two quick touchdowns, Redd took over on the final drive of the game to shut the door on the Wildcats.
In his first game as playcaller, offensive coordinator Clay Helton pushed all the right buttons for the USC offense. The Trojans finished with 546 total yards, including 249 yards rushing on 45 total carries (5.5 yards per rush). Helton dispersed carries among his stable of talented running backs, with five different tailbacks tallying carries.
Arizona finished the game with 508 total yards as USC’s pass defense struggled once again.
The team did manage to somewhat minimize damage from Arizona tailback Ka’Deem Carey, who gained 138 rushing yards on 21 carries but never reached the end zone. Carey led the nation in rushing last season with 1,929 yards.
“[The defense] did a good job, but we need to play better in the second half,” redshirt senior outside linebacker Devon Kennard said. “That’s the second week in a row where we didn’t have the best second half, so we have to address it and fix it, and we will.”
With the victory, USC moves into third place in the Pac-12 South behind Arizona State and UCLA. The Trojans next play on Oct. 19 against Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind.

Silas Redd.  That last run last night, the run for the first down that got USC the win…that little run was one of the classics.  Short but sweet.  One for the all-time books.  That run represented everything we did well in the game.  And I feel sorry for any of those Arizona dudes who got in the way of you and your blockers.
Proof that the right leadership makes all the difference, congrats to Coach O and the players!
I loved watching our team last night. The only thing that concerns me is the defense was getting tired in the 4th quarter. When players put their hands on their hips you can see that they are winded and need a break. If we have more depth in the defensive line and linebackers maybe we can avoid the breakdown going forward. I can see that the team has the Trojan Spirit again under Coach O’s direction. I love it. Fight On, beat the Doomers!
Yes it was obvious the team was getting very tired. They started out ‘all hells bells’ and all that amazing fun and energy was expended a little too fast and furious in my opinion. So they paid for that wonderful crazy first half…at the end of the 2nd half.
Still happy as all other Trojans, that we have a new start and that Kiffin and his cranky, immature ways – is gone.

Classical KUSC launched its membership drive Thursday with a kickoff event featuring classical music experts Rich Capparela and Jim Svejda joining forces in a comedic broadcast.
Capparela and Svejda, who are considered two of the nation’s most knowledgeable commentators on classical music, host separate popular shows on Classical KUSC.

For this year’s fall membership drive, the two shared a radio booth on Thursday, and will share one again on Oct. 18. The drive is an attempt to encourage more listeners to donate money to become members of the station.
Station General Manager Eric DeWeese said that these hours have received a lot of positive feedback.
“They put a lot more of their own humor into these hours,” he told USC News. “We know there are people who tune in specifically to hear them.”
Capparela credited Svejda for this popularity, calling him flawlessly easy to get along with on air.
“It’s a little like that storied married couple who finish each other’s sentences,” Capperela told USC News. “We do get great feedback, especially when one of us inevitably cracks up the other and that person falls into helpless giggling.”
The station’s members are vital, as about 70 percent of KUSC’s operating budget comes from individual donors.
DeWeese also said that the challenge of membership drives is to keep the messages positive so that listeners don’t mind more time being spent on talking, rather than music.
“We don’t want to make people feel guilty or listen to begging,” he said. “Listeners tell us they like learning more about our announcers and hearing their humorous sides.”
Minnie Prince, KUSC’s director of development, organized the membership drive with DeWeese, who is also in charge of the thank-you gifts. DeWeese said that some of the gifts were popular enough to be offered drive after drive.
One particular gift, a copy of George Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue” recorded by Mitch Miller, has been offered annually for two decades.
Kian Pasha, a senior majoring in performance trumpet, was unsure of how successful the drive will be.
“I listen to KUSC all the time because it’s a great resource for classical music,” he said, “but I don’t know how good of an idea this membership drive is.”
There will also be a one-hour special on classical music in film scores to be hosted by Capparela on Friday. Another one-hour special on classical guitar will air at on Oct. 15.
Svejda will also join Duff Murphy on The Opera Show with Duff Murphy for another round of banter. This duo will be broadcasting on Saturday, talking between excerpts from various operas.
 
If you’re ever not feeling enough Trojan pride, you can reflect on how extraordinary it is that a university could have both the best classical music station in the world, and the best student-run station on the Internet.

USC’s Good Neighbors Campaign, an initiative to raise $1.7 million for the surrounding community over the course of one year, will come to a close on Oct. 31.
Design by Mollie Berg
GNC is an annual employee giving initiative organized by the Civic Engagement Initiative through which faculty can give one-time donations or monthly payroll deductions to go toward community programs.
Since its inception, GNC has raised more than $16 million for the community.
GNC uses its contributions to enhance educational opportunities, promote good health and fitness (specifically focusing on type two diabetes and obesity prevention), support economic development through USC’s hiring initiative and improve safety in the surrounding community.
This year, GNC is focusing on supplementing science and engineering education in elementary schools and creating dialogue about land-use issues with high school students.
“Last year, we surpassed our goal of $1.6 million, so this year our new goal is $1.7 million,” said Carolina Castillo, the GNC campaign director.
Using funds from last year, GNC funded Mission Science, a program at six schools near the University Park and Health Sciences campuses that teaches elementary school students about technology, engineering and mathematics.
Mission Science sends USC Viterbi School of Engineering mentors to local schools to collaborate with the children on projects, ranging from small-scale experiments to creating model rockets.
The fund also supports “Our Neighborhood: Youth Artists as Civic Leaders,” a program that allows youth between the ages of 15 and 25 to artistically respond to social issues they see in their communities. Young adults in the program work with USC Roski students and professional artists to create public art pieces for the community.
Those on USC payroll can set up annual deductions to contribute to the fund, making it easy and convenient for faculty to give back. Students, alumni and people who are not affiliated with the university can contribute to the campaign as well.
Some students, however, have expressed their frustration with the program.
“While I think it’s great that USC is acting upon [its] responsibility to support [the] surrounding community, I hope that they will keep in mind that the socioeconomic issues affecting these communities are a lot more complex than they seem,” said Hannah Nguyen, a sophomore majoring in sociology and Spanish. “Throwing money at a problem only does so much; the problems affecting these communities are systemic, historic and complicated, but they will be solved by people, the same resilient and unrelenting people who live this reality every day.”
Others, however, believed that the campaign was a good way for USC to have positive relationships with people in the community.
“I think the Good Neighbors Campaign helps us give back to the community that we live in,” said Tianna Li, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “It’s really important to maintain good relations with our neighbors and the campaign is a good way to do that.”
Though this round of fundraising ends Oct. 31, donations to the GNC can be made throughout the year.

As a long-time supporter of the Good Neighbors Campaign, I was happy to read the cover page article on October 11 by Deena Khattab.  However, I noticed that the article included a significant omission.  In her article, Deena mentions that “faculty can make payroll contributions” to GNC, that it’s “easy and convenient for faculty to give back,” etc.
While the contributions of the faculty to GNC are well-documented and not to be underestimated, nowhere in her article does Deena give any mention or credit to the hardworking and generous staff at USC.  From its outset, the Good Neighbors Campaign has welcomed employee gifts from ALL areas of the university, from all the academic units to admissions, auxiliary services, research institutes, public safety, etc.  Giving back to our community is a University-wide effort, and the significant contributions of the staff should also be heralded and recognized.

Todd Cunningham, a former MTV/Viacom executive, was announced as the new director of the Norman Lear Center’s Media Impact Project on Thursday.
The Media Impact Project, a collaboration by the USC Viterbi School of Engineering and the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, is designed to measure the amount of social impact media has on audiences.
The project, part of a new trend to use social media to measure the popularity and cultural influence of media, has already received $3.25 million in funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. On Thursday, Nielsen launched its first ever Twitter TV ratings, which measure the number of tweets about a television show, and the number of users who read tweets on a TV show.
“We were able to see the impact, in that [shows that] got the most membership, which had been, in the past, considered the most popular, are not the ones that are the most tweeted about,” Cunningham said. “I think we’re actively redefining what popular means.”
According to Nielsen, Scandal was the most popular show on Twitter this week.
“As a culture, we’re mystified by the fact that Scandal has so many followers,” Cunningham said. “The writer of the show [Shonda Rimes] is writing for that very activity, so she’s further down the path [to using new media] than many other organizations are.”
MIP, however, does more than identify trends in pop culture. Though the number of Facebook likes and Twitter retweets could indicate something is a popular topic, it might not accurately represent the medium’s influence regarding social movements or changes.
“The goal is to try to come up with methods to assess the impact of how media can be used to impact people and change their activities and decisions in their lives,” Director of the Center or Human Behavioral Informatics at the USC Information Sciences Institute Carl Kesselman said.
The project was initiated through research done by Managing Director and Director of Research at USC Annenberg’s Norman Lear Center Johanna Blakely.
“[She studied] ways that observing media would cause people to take action,” Kesselman said. “We’re particularly interested in how media produces follow-up action.”
Certain forms of media might trigger behavioral shifts in audiences.
“[People might say] ‘I saw a movie so I signed a petition,’ or ‘I read a newspaper article now I buy organic food,’” Kesselman said. “There’s a lot of interest in what role [media] plays.”
According to Cunningham, the project is an attempt to determine what in the media causes people to join together for a cause.
“I think that we will try to tackle what are the motivations for people to actually socialize with one another around content and to rally around one another to actually act in ways that they hadn’t done before,” Cunningham said. “I think we’re also trying to understand what the expectations of those interactions are.”
Media has historically played a role in aiding social movements.
“There’s been a lot of interest around the use of Twitter in the Arab Spring, and the influence that that had in rallying people around making social or governmental change in that case,” Kesselman said.
One significant aspect of the project involves the collaboration of the Viterbi and Annenberg schools.
“[At] Annenberg, they’re obviously the experts in digital media and communication, [as well as] the producers of content and assessing impact of content. What Viterbi brings to the table [expertise] in how we manage and manipulate large scale sorts of data, out of which we’re trying to extract knowledge about impact or observe impact,” Kesselman said. “It’s what [Dean] Yannis Yortsos called ‘engineering plus.’”
On the engineering end, the project aims to find new ways to measure impact. Currently, methods are feedback-based.
“It’s hard to assess, and quite often done by asking people, or taking surveys. You actually go ask people what they saw, what they were exposed to, how they felt before and after and if they did something different after,” Kesselman said.
Kesselman said that USC’s environment makes it a perfect host for the project.
“This is the kind of project that USC is very uniquely positioned to do, just because of strength we have in all the various departments, the focus on interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary scholarship,” he said. “[The environment] allows for people who are studying engineering and communications to sit down and work together.”
The project will try to help journalism and media organizations better understand how to utilize media for change, Cunningham said.
In terms of popular culture, students said they are increasingly being influenced by media.  Martha Daniel, a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism, admitted to being affected by her Twitter feed.
“Occasionally, I’ll tweet about a show,” she said. “I follow a lot of my favorite actors and actresses on Twitter and a lot of times they retweet things they find interesting, and I’ll check it out.”
Daniel, however, is skeptical about the extent of change certain media can bring about.
“I don’t think a TV show could spark something like the Arab Spring or the demonstrations in Egypt,” she said.
Though not all forms of media have the same capacity to spark this sort of change, pop culture in general can initiate talk about deep-seated issues. Cindy Kim, a freshman majoring in biology, recently witnessed this in reactions she saw on social media regarding Robin Thicke’s song “Blurred Lines.”
“His performance with Miley Cyrus at the VMAs caused a big reaction. The way Miley acted on stage combined with the lyrics implied that she was being dominated [by Thicke] with her body language, suggesting subordinate sexual positions,” Kim said.
Kim feels whether or not media sparks social change, society is nevertheless affected.
“Adolescents are constantly surrounded by advertising and television,” she said. “Even though we may not share popular opinions, we’re still influenced, whether positively or negatively. We automatically have a reaction.”

This week, the USC Shoah Foundation began its five-year, $150 million fundraising initiative to preserve the current Visual History Archive and fund other projects.
The announcement of the initiative was made at the Ambassadors for Humanity Gala in New York City on Oct. 3. The gala, which was hosted by Jon Stewart, also made headlines when it presented actor George Clooney with its Ambassador for Humanity award for his work in Darfur and Haiti among other places.
“We have three major areas that we are raising money for that includes education, research and access. Those are the overarching goals that our programs feed into,” said Steven Klappholz, executive director of development for the Shoah Foundation.
“The $150 million initiative is going to help establish an endowment fund for the foundation, preservation of the archives, support annual operations and capital projects.”
Founded in 1994 by Director Steven Spielberg following his work on the film Schindler’s List, the Shoah Foundation’s goal is to collect video testimony from survivors of the Holocaust and other genocides and preserve the accounts in a digital archive that can be used for education and research. The archive currently has approximately 52,000 testimonies and is expanding to include the genocides in Rwanda, Cambodia and Armenia in addition to the Holocaust.

“The basis of the fundraising effort is educating people about the scope and purpose of the foundation and asking them to join with us,” Klappholz said. “It really is a collaborative effort on behalf of the entire university.”
Fundraising for the Shoah Foundation is done in collaboration with the USC Dornsife Office of Advancement, which conducts the fundraising efforts including major gifts, corporate and foundation support, government grants and annual appeal letters.
Some of the ongoing programs the funds will support include iWitness, an online tool that allows students to search through video testimony based on a key theme or topic, as well as the continuing expansion of the video archives. The foundation is working to expand access points to the archives at other universities in the United States and around the world.
John Ingram, a junior majoring in sociology, interned for the Shoah Foundation in the spring of his freshman year after taking a freshman seminar offered by the foundation in the fall.
“It was great because it wasn’t just boring desk work,” Ingram said. “I was learning about and interacting with all these people’s experiences, and it was very empowering.”
One of the foundation’s main objectives is to empower educators to teach about such genocides by providing resources such as iWitness. During his time interning at the Shoah Foundation, Ingram utilized digital tools to help middle school teachers who are educating their students about the Holocaust. Ingram called his experience rewarding and said it gave him a better understanding of the human condition.
“Each individual matters, their personal stories and triumphs, how they persevered through [the genocide],” he said. “I remember one story of a man who saved 400 people, and he didn’t want any credit, he just did what he had to.”
Many Jewish students have called the foundation’s efforts crucial for preserving their heritage.
“USC’s commitment to Holocaust education is representative through the Shoah Foundation,” said Dylan Abrams, a sophomore majoring in psychology. “On countless occasions I’ve accessed the foundation’s database for projects, papers and for personal interest. I’ve heard a lot of [Holocaust survivor] testimony personally, and I know the importance of documenting it. The USC Shoah Foundation is the only organization in the world that is documenting it through video and on such a scale.”
For many, the Shoah Foundation is a place they can go to learn more about their ancestry.
“It’s an amazing organization. I’ve heard a half-dozen or so Holocaust survivors tell me their stories in person, but to have access to an archive like the Shoah Foundation’s is incredible,” said Benjamin Smith, a sophomore majoring in international relations and economics.  “It’s like a key that unlocks a huge part of my culture’s history.”
I hope someday soon victims of the Nakba can add their testimonies as well.
Article 2 of the Convention adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948 defines genocide as
    …any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:
        (a) Killing members of the group;
        (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
        (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
        (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
        (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

Almost exactly two years ago, the USC women’s volleyball team took a road trip to Oregon State and Oregon and returned home without losing a single set. This year, with some of the same players from that 2011 trip, the Women of Troy hope to duplicate the results and keep their winning streak alive.
USC, who regained the No. 1 spot in the American Volleyball Coaches Association poll this week and are ranked No. 2 in the NCAA Women’s Volleyball RPI, has won eight consecutive matches and now boasts a 14-1 record (4-0 in the Pac-12). With nonconference play now over for the rest of the regular season, the Women of Troy are in the middle of a 20-match slate against Pac-12 opponents. This weekend, the squad will get its first look at the Oregon State Beavers and the No. 22 Oregon Ducks.

So far, the Women of Troy have won all of its matches at the Galen Center, but the team’s capability of playing in true road games is relatively untested. Even though USC started its season with nine consecutive matches away from home, only four were played against opponents in their home arenas. And in one of those instances, against San Diego, the Women of Troy suffered their lone loss of the season.
USC head coach Mick Haley said he understands the importance of capturing these early road matches.
“In this conference, people really hold their home-court advantage,” Haley said. “That’s your only chance to survive in the conference. When you get a chance to play at home and you don’t hold that home-court advantage, it really puts you on the defensive.”
The team will have a chance to put both of their opponents this weekend in a deep hole, as the Beavers have already lost their first four Pac-12 matches, and the Ducks have fallen in two of their first four, including one at home in Eugene.
On the flip side, USC has been seemingly unstoppable during the past few weeks. After losing to USD on Sept. 13, the team has rattled off eight straight wins. Two of those opponents — UCLA and Stanford — are currently ranked in the top 25.
Senior libero Natalie Hagglund credits the recent success to the combination of veteran leadership and superb freshman play.
“It’s been really important to stay patient,” Hagglund said. “We have some young players who are making an extreme impact with us and some older players who are making a great impact as well. We’re able to gel together with that age difference and understand that our freshmen are still freshmen, yet they are such important factors for us and our success.”
The team has not only improved their individual play throughout the year, but also their chemistry as a cohesive unit on the court. Junior setter Hayley Crone said the team has taken a giant leap forward from where it stood at the beginning of the year to its recent play in conference matches.
“At the beginning of the season, we were just getting to know each other,” Crone said. “We’re kind of past that stage. Now we’re all focusing on the same goal.”
Crone also appreciates the team’s ability to stay focused late in games when the pressure turns up. Sunday’s match against Cal was the first time the Women of Troy had been forced into a fifth and deciding set this season.
“I think [being in a five set match] was really good for us,” Crone said. “It is important to know what it feels like to be in the fifth set with this team, and you never know what can happen. It prepares us for later in the season.”
For the Women of Troy to prove their worth on the road, they will look to their top offensive performers to continue playing at a high level.
Against Cal, freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu had a career-high 21 kills, sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio tallied 16 kills and senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard also reached a career-high in kills with 15. Olgard also led the Women of Troy with eight blocks.
Both games this weekend will be televised on the Pac-12 Network, with Friday’s game beginning at 6 p.m. in Corvallis and Sunday’s game starting at 3 p.m. in Eugene.

If we rewound the clock 40 years, and USC’s game next week was between the 1973 Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the 1973 Trojans instead of the 2013 editions of each team, there would be a whole lot more anticipation and excitement heading into the matchup.
USC was at the height of the John McKay era, having just won a national championship the year before, and came into the matchup at 5-0-1. Notre Dame was led by legendary coach Ara Parseghian, who led the team back to national prominence with a national championship in 1966, and the Irish came into the game 5-0.
Notre Dame had the advantage that year, going on to win both the Battle for the Golden Shillelagh and the national championship that year. But the Trojans would avenge the loss a year later with an epic 55-24 comeback win led by a young Pat Haden at quarterback en route to another national championship in the 1974 season.
Unfortunately, for both Irish and Trojan fans alike, we no longer live in the 1970s. No longer do the two dominate the national scene; no longer are the two teams even ranked; no longer does the showdown between the two annually have a huge effect on the national championship picture.
Despite a big 38-31 win last night against Arizona, the Trojans will head into South Bend next week with a record of 4-s and likely unranked by the AP Top 25 poll.
Notre Dame started the season with higher expectations, but losses to Michigan and Oklahoma have knocked the Irish out of the Top 25 already. Last week, they narrowly beat the same unranked Arizona State squad that embarrassed the Trojans two weeks ago.
The Irish are only a year removed from playing for the BCS National Championship, in which they turned in a rather dismal performance against a much better Alabama team after an otherwise great regular season. But the team, which has arguably the most storied history in the sport, hasn’t claimed a national championship since 1988, back when Lou Holtz was their head coach.
Though USC fans like me have been much luckier to have seen a national championship this millennium, the program has struggled to reassert its dominance in conference play since the Pac-10 added two teams and expanded to the Pac-12.
For two teams rich with so much history, it shouldn’t be that hard to entice recruits based on promises of national exposure and futures in the NFL. Both teams, however, have lost the once-intrinsic reputation of excellence they were built upon. Now they both have to earn that respect back.
The winner of next week’s game will take home more than just the Jeweled Shillelagh; they’ll establish what direction their program is taking. It’s a possible springboard game for both teams — a chance for Brian Kelly to show that last year’s national title game appearance was more than a fluke, and a chance for Ed Orgeron to show that this year’s team has not given up on the season.
In some ways, however, Notre Dame and USC aren’t bitter opponents. They are two teams with similar histories, fighting the rising tides of parity in college football together. Beyond next Saturday, the two teams have to be rooting for each other to some degree. Both programs want to see that the new age of flashy jerseys and hurry-up offenses in college football haven’t moved on without them.
But until Saturday, Notre Dame is the same old foe from across the country, and the looming matchup in South Bend will be just another addition to one of the most storied rivalries in history. The question is: How much longer will it be nationally relevant?

Sink into irrelevance?  Haha.  The author of this article is more delusional than most of the wacko commentors on this site.
What a load of garbage.  Not relevant nationally?  Yeah, to find the last time this game was nationally relevant you have to go AAALLLLLL the back to the 2012 season where a USC win would have knocked notre dame out of the championship game.  And it was a close game that wasn’t decided until the end.  If you mean you want both teams in the running for a championship, then sure.  That hasn’t happened in about half a decade.  Oh noooo.  Of course, that’s only happened a handful of times in the history of the series, but that’s okay.  Make up what you want.
Wow, I sincerely hope that the writer of this article does not go into sports writing for a living.  The USC-ND rivalry might sink into irrelevance?  Really??  This old fashioned rivalry only dates back to 1926.  Even though most people consider this the greatest intersectional rivalry in college football, that doesn’t really matter any more, right Luke?  I can’t wait to see your article on the USC-ucla matchup.  That’s just one of those irrelevant cross-town rivalries…

The USC women’s soccer will try to break out of their four-game losing streak with a major upset this weekend, as they head up north to take on No. 8 California on Friday at 3 p.m., followed by another tough match against No. 5 Stanford on Sunday at 5 p.m. Both games will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Network.
The Women of Troy (5-6-1, 0-3-0 Pac-12) are coming off a pair of losses last weekend, a 1-0 defeat to Washington and a 2-0 setback to Washington State. Strong defense and goalkeeping from junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley kept the games close, but ultimately the offense was unable to produce, putting up only 3 shots on goal on 20 shots over both contests.

The loss sunk USC into a tie with Arizona for last place in the Pac-12.
“For sure, we’re frustrated right now,” junior forward Jessica Musmanno said. “But it’s also an opportunity for us to set things right each time we set foot on the field.”
USC hasn’t scored a goal since Sept. 22 against Cal State Fullerton, when sophomore midfielder Megan Borman scored 37 seconds into the match to give the Women of Troy a 1-0 lead. USC would ultimately lose the contest 2-1 in overtime, starting their current slide. They haven’t been able to find the back of the net three games into conference play, making it a stretch of 360 minutes without a goal. The power outage is especially surprising considering the squad scored 12 goals in the first three games of the season.
“With the rest of the Pac-12 left, that’s all we’ve got,” senior forward Elizabeth Eddy said. “We’ve got to make sure we give it our all each game. We’re really pumped for the weekend and we’re gonna do our best.”
The Golden Bears (9-0-3, 2-0-1 in the Pac-12) are currently tied with UCLA and Utah for first place in the conference. Cal’s strength has been holding strong on defense from the opening whistle; the Bears haven’t allowed a goal in the first half this season, outscoring opponents 10-0 before halftime.
Forward Ifeoma Onumonu, last year’s Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, leads California with eight goals and 18 points on the season. Kaitlyn Fitzpatrick and Samantha Witteman have six goals apiece, while goalie Emily Kruger has a 0.71 goals against average and four shutouts on the season.
Last year, USC and California faced off at McAlister Field, with No. 21 California squeezing out a 1-0 victory. Onumonu scored the only goal in the 74th minute. USC is 10-7-1 all-time against California, but has lost the past two meetings.
The Cardinal (9-1-1, 2-1-0 in the  Pac-12) are led by Taylor Uhl, the top scorer in the Pac-12 with 10 goals. Courtney Verloo leads the team with five assists to go along with six goals scored.
Stanford and USC competed at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum last season, with the Cardinal getting a late break, winning the game 1-0 in double overtime with mere seconds left on the clock. Then-junior midfielder Jordan Marada looked like she scored the game-winner early in the first overtime, but an offsides call gave Stanford a chance to steal the victory.
“I think we’ve all been feeling the urgency for a few weeks now,” USC head coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “It’s just trying to get it back there. I don’t think anyone is complacent. I think we’re all working hard trying to solve the problem.”

Watching movies and TV shows on streaming links and illegal sites for free is becoming increasingly commonplace. This is especially true here on a college campus where most students are not exactly flush with cash. The temptation to break a relatively minor law to get some free entertainment becomes very tempting when balanced against a $15 movie ticket.
To be honest, I’ve streamed media illegally a few times myself — and I’ve almost always hated it. Setting aside any concern over illegality and the film industry escalating its enforcement of copyright laws, it’s just a depressing way to watch a film.
There is a quality to watching a film in a movie theater that is difficult to get anywhere else. Being in the dark, immersing oneself in the action on that giant screen, there’s a sense of it being an experience. It certainly adds a lot to the experience of watching a movie. Again, I certainly don’t watch all my movies in the theater. As a matter of fact, I’ve probably watched 80 percent of the movies I’ve seen over the last three-plus years on a laptop. Those movies, though, have almost always been on DVDs, Netflix or Amazon Instant Video. But watching a film from a link site is just not enough. After looking around for a long while to find a link for that new superhero movie you were excited to watch, you get a fuzzy, vaguely Iron Man-shaped thing, flying around the screen. That is, until Iron Man freezes in the middle of the sky as the link stops to buffer a little more. It’s bearable when he starts back up again in a little while, but all too often that link breaks down and you’re left with the option to dig around for another link or give up the hope of knowing what happened.
The convenience of watching a movie on your laptop or on your phone is fantastic. We live in an age when, with a smartphone, a subscription to Netflix and the right mood, you can start watching Pulp Fiction while standing in line at Subway. That accessibility is convenient, as is the impressive selection of films it makes available. Watching on screens that small certainly sacrifices a good amount of the immersive quality you get in the theaters. It’s inherently a lot harder when your field of vision contains a lot more than the screen, but the experience also suffers from the combination of fuzzy quality and that moment when the buffering stutter reaches comical levels.
Beyond this? It can seriously mess up your device. The websites that offer this kind of selection are not the most reputable and one thing that is very common on these less-than-trustworthy sites is malware and viruses that can latch onto your computer and make it more difficult to use for more important things.
There are plenty of legal streaming services online. Any one of these can offer high quality image and virtually no threat of cutting off your film midstream. Netflix has spread to the point that its virtues don’t really need to be sung any more here, but I’ve heard more and more complaints about the selection it offers. Amazon Instant is great for this. For the most part, they’ve offered everything I couldn’t find on Netflix on 24-hour rentals for two or three bucks. It’s still money being spent, but it’s less than the price of a movie ticket. Amazon has even begun to offer some films at the same time they are released in theaters, so, in some cases, there isn’t even a delay.
I’ve heard plenty of arguments about why we shouldn’t have to pay for movies, but none that are really convincing. The work that goes into moviemaking is very real and very rigorous. There is certainly a lot of money being made by these movies, but there is often even more money being spent on them, and the reality is that the film industry is struggling to balance the books these days. Cutting out more of their much-needed income, for the opportunity to illegally watch a greatly dulled movie experience that puts the probably-expensive device you are using to watch it in danger seems like a lose-lose situation.

Keeping the legality issue aside, this is one of the worst articles I’ve ever read. I hope the author is not considering journalism as a career.
Technology changes and advances.  Business models need to adapt.  That’s how economics work.
How exactly is the film industry hurt? There are more films made now than ever. It seems that only the distribution industry is harmed by piracy, not the film industry.

Every year, thousands of people flock to West Hollywood’s Santa Monica Boulevard with signs, t-shirts, balloons and running shoes to walk 6.2 miles under the early morning October sun.

The AIDS Walk Los Angeles, happening Sunday, raises money for services provided by AIDS Project Los Angeles and other AIDS service organizations throughout L.A. County. It also promotes awareness for the disease, as well as offering support and companionship as volunteers walk arm-in-arm with families who have lost loved ones as well as with patients themselves.
The event attracts a wide variety of participants, including USC students. According to the AIDS Walk registration page, there are currently 15 USC-affiliated groups signed up to walk.
One such team is USC OUTreach, a student organization that serves the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and ally community through its involvement in community service and queer issues.
For sophomore Dawson Ray, co-president of OUTreach, this year will be his second time walking in the event. Ray said he expects somewhere around 30 students from the organization to participate, which is similar to the turnout from last year.
Ray said that the one aspect of the walk he most looks forward to is meeting new people, walking alongside them and hearing their stories.
“It’s a really social event, and really uplifting for something that sounds so depressing,” Ray said.
In addition to his club obligations, Ray said his reasons for showing support for the cause are also more personal.
“Growing up, a lot of my older, gay mentors lost a lot of really good friends to the disease,” he said. “It was teachers who were talking about losing 30 friends in one year. It’s unbelievable. So when I walk, I walk for them and their loss.”
For some students, this will be their first experience with AIDS Walk.
This is the first time freshman theater major Gabriela Ortega will be taking part in any sort of fundraising event. Ortega said she is passionate about being involved with this cause, as she finds it to be an integral part of history and of the world around her.
“It’s interesting — it’s a disease that marked a generation before us,” Ortega said. “One of my idols, Freddy Mercury, died of it … It was so influential in everything — music, art and all of it. It’s something that cannot be ignored.”
Ortega’s encounter with a man who had AIDS when she was younger also propelled her interest in and empathy for the disease.
“The first time I actually interacted with someone with AIDS was outside a restaurant,” she said. “I was with my dad, and the person just needed money for medicine. Everybody else ignored him. My dad asked him, ‘Why do you need money?’ He was talking about how when he was young and stupid, he had unprotected sex and caught AIDS, and how that destroyed all of his personal relationships for a long while.”
Ortega said the man’s physically weak appearance moved her to act compassionately.
“I was really young, so I didn’t understand it, but I see this person, and he’s really skinny, but he looks normal,” Ortega said. “He’s not offensive — someone who looks really weak, but it doesn’t look like a touch from that person would kill you.”
Justin Zhang, a freshman majoring global health major, signed up for the event after seeing a flier on his RA’s door. His reasons for participating stemmed partly from his academic interest in global health.
“We’ve been talking about HIV and AIDS a lot in class, so I understand how big of an issue it is … it is a very serious disease,” Zhang said. “You read things in the paper — ‘Oh, this many people died in this accident,’ — but you don’t really reveal the emotional impact until you get a firsthand experience of it.”
Zhang said he also volunteered in hopes of challenging himself to move beyond his comfort zone and beyond the confines of the campus.
“A lot of people like myself have grown up predominantly in one of the so-called ‘suburban bubbles,’ and you’re basically unaware,” Zhang said. “It’s important to take part in these events so you become more connected with the community, and you realize, ‘Hey, there is more to the city than USC or L.A. Live.’”
Ortega echoed this sentiment, adding that it is important for students to note the difference between saying they support a cause and physically supporting it. She said that highlighting this difference and making it “distinct” would encourage more students to get involved.
“If you really feel passionately about issues around the world that affect people, why don’t you go out and say something or do something about it?” Ortega said. “Especially our generation is so influenced by the media that we hide behind that electronic stuff — we don’t actually go out and do stuff.”
Ortega said that the walk is less about fundraising than it is about the collective effort put forth by a group of people.
“Doing something about it makes you feel like you’re being active about it — not just, ‘We want your money,’” she said. “No — we actually want your awareness and your support. It’s not just about the money you raise for an organization or how well known it is, but how people feel about it and how they react to it.”
This Sunday, as volunteers march triumphantly down fan-filled streets to cross the finish line, it will be clear that USC students are not alone in their goal to be a part of something bigger than themselves and their community.
“Seeing the diversity of the people who go to the event — young people, elderly people, college students, rich college students from good families — they’re  going to a walk about AIDS,” Ortega said. “It’s interesting to see different people come together. The whole image would show that this could happen to anyone.”

What started as a backyard collegiate show, Sigma Chi’s main philanthropy event has now become a nationally recognized charity concert. Derby Days, which donates its proceeds to the Children’s Hospital of L.A., has been going full force since it was started in 2005. This year, Sigma Chi has rebranded the event, which is hosted at the Belasco in Downtown L.A., as USC Derby Days rather than Sigma Chi Derby Days to make it a more university-wide event and reach out to more students.

Directors and self-appointed “Derby Daddies” Kyle Midgley and Anthony Daniels, seniors majoring in business administration, said it was important for them to bring more students in from USC to attend Derby Days because they believe that it’s a way for the student body to give back to the community by going to a concert they would enjoy.
“We’ve got the Trojan Dance Marathon Planning Committee and Concerts Committee behind us this year to include more people,” Midgley said. “The main purpose of our event is to raise money for the Children’s Miracle Network that then gives the money to CHLA, and so the more people that attend, the bigger the donation we can have which makes everything about the event even better.”
CHLA and Sigma Chi have a long history of working together, and some of the children have even met the brothers.
Derby Days has raised more than $200,000 since its inception, and one event typically raises more money than most other fraternity philanthropies combined. Daniels said that they hope to beat their own previous fundraising goals this semester.
“We’re trying to make this the largest donation ever in the history of Derby Days or even in any college philanthropy,” Daniels said.
In the past four years, the event has featured several well-known artists, including LMFAO and MGMT. This year, Christian Karlsson of Miike Snow will be the disc jockey set. Miike Snow’s song “Paddling Out” was featured on the FIFA Soccer 13 video game soundtrack and in a new Budweiser ad.
A live set will also performed by New York City electronic duo The Knocks, who were named one of the top 20 hottest producers in music by New Musical Express magazine. Its successful single “Modern Hearts” earned the group a number one spot on “Hype Machine,” an MP3 aggregator. The song also reached the 100,000 plays mark on SoundCloud in just four days. They have also toured with Ellie Goulding and shared a stage with artists including DeadMau5, Skrillex and Tiesto.
DJ Dr. Fresch, a recent USC graduate, is also scheduled to DJ at the event.
“I became very involved with CHLA in my time at USC through helping out with past Derby Days events, especially after I made my first trip to the hospital in 2010, so I’m happy to be given an opportunity to perform,” Fresch said. “Sharing the stage with the likes of Miike Snow and The Knocks is going to be unreal.”
Tianna Li, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said that Sigma Chi seems to be making an effort to attract students outside the Greek community.
“As a member of the Trojan Dance Marathon Planning Committee, it makes me care more about their concert,” Li said. “If I didn’t know better, I’d think it was an excuse for Sigma Chi to throw a big concert just to show off, but it’s actually for a really good cause and they are actually trying really hard to show everyone that it’s not just a ‘Greek thing’ — they want everyone to go and have a good time.”
Daniel Younger, a senior majoring in business administration and a member of Sigma Chi, said that Derby Days allows the fraternity to give back to the community in a big way.
“It’s an opportunity for us to prove ourselves beyond a social level and use our collective energy and resources to do good for others. This cause is close to our heart,” Younger said. “The lineup is a mix of a lot of artists across many genres and so there should be something for everybody.”
The event will be held at The Belasco Theatre Downtown this Saturday.
Admission to the concert costs $25 to $30, and corporate donations will also be accepted. The money received by CHLA goes mostly toward the needs of families of patients.

In response to “USG salaries established as the highest in the Pac-12”
On behalf of USC’s Undergraduate Student Government, I would like to offer a very simple explanation as to why USG pays its members: diversity and inclusion. As an organization, USG strives to attract and retain some of USC’s brightest and most diverse students. In order to do that, USG inevitably hires and appoints students every year that come from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds.
If we do not pay our members, students who are in need of a paid job on or off campus would be unable to commit their time to serving the student body.
USG members receive a stipend in order to allow student leaders to be compensated for their time commitment. Through this stipend, a large population of student leaders have the opportunity to serve on USG, who otherwise would not be able to afford to commit their time to the organization. Offering financial compensation for the hours USG members work allows students who personally finance their own education to work on USG.
To explain further, USG positions (which require some members to work up to 20 hours per week) take time away from other responsibilities, some of which could include a job, internship or any other type of monetary compensation for their time and work elsewhere. The fact of the matter is that if we don’t compensate our members, we lose out on some very talented students.
Transparency has been called into question on behalf of our stipends and compensation. However, the USG budget, however,  is publicly displayed on our website. Public schools are required to publish their stipends, but USC, as a private school, is not required to maintain public record of USG’s stipends.
The first thing the Kurth-Park administration implemented was salary cuts across the board, resulting in more than $30,000 of funds, which were reallocated into the budget. Contrary to accusations, we have chosen to remain transparent with our budget and expenditures, including student compensation.
Personally, like most USG executive positions, I was not aware of the compensation when I first joined. Typically, to join USG, students initially participate as a delegate, then pursue a position as an assistant director, which make up the majority of our organization.
These positions are not paid, and only positions that require the time commitment of a part-time job are monetarily compensated. These positions are compensated for a minimum number of hours that are required to be in the office working on advocacy, programming, legislation and/or funding. These compensated hours, however, are nowhere near representative of the total hours that our members dedicate to their respective responsibilities.
It’s that simple.
We want USG to mirror the diversity of the student body as much as possible. With no compensation, USG would not only lose out on some incredible talent, but also would be segregating itself from the diverse student body it works so tirelessly to serve.

Then why are the top executives in USG guys from the Row, year after year? This reeks of political double-talk
Nice, except the issue is not that you pay yourselves, the issue is that you waaay overpay yourselves.
 Mr. Kurth, you will make a great politician by skirting the issue and not answering the question. Fabulous characteristic for one as young as yourself.

The Thai government recently started ironing out the details of what they call the civil-partnership bill, drafted by the Parliament. The bill, according to the Wall Street Journal, will enable gay men and women to enter into a civil partnership.
Tammy Do | Daily Trojan
 
The bill is expected to extend certain benefits to same-sex couples, such as shared insurance, pension and inheritance. If such a law is passed, Thailand is expected to become the first Southeast Asian nation to extend its marriage benefits to same-sex couples. Many have hailed the movement as Asia’s step towards becoming more accepting of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.
Though Thailand’s move toward marriage equality should be commended, the international community must recognize that the East Asian region, as a whole, has a long way to go in creating a more open and accepting environment for LGBT individuals.
To many, Thailand appears to be far more open towards those in the LGBT community. The Tourism Authority of Thailand has dedicated a segment of its website, titled “Go Thai. Be Free” to promote the idea that Thai hospitality also applies to the LGBT community.
On the Tourism Authority website, they explain “Go Thai. Be Free is the slogan that we feel sums in a gay vacation in Thailand.” It appears that the Tourism Authority has only established these statements to encourage tourists from the LGBT community to visit Thailand, which in turn would boost their economy. The new trend is fostering what is dubbed “pink tourism” — and it’s expected to bring in more revenue for the Thai state.
Thus, Thailand’s intentions behind legalizing same-sex marriage are questionable. Conservative ideologies remain at large in the predominantly Buddhist state, despite Buddhist teachings that focus on compassion. Reality shows that the Thai law remains not so liberal, according to the Bangkok Post. Same-sex marriage is yet to be recognized in Thailand, and it was not until 2002 that Thai Ministry of Health declared homosexuality no longer a mental illness disorder. In addition, Thai armed forces banned those of the LGBT community from serving in the military until 2005.
Last year, the Foundation for Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Rights and Justice interviewed 868 individuals who identified themselves as gay, lesbian or transgender throughout the nation, according to the Bangkok Post. Many of these individuals in the Thai LGBT community still feel alienated from society and discriminated against.
Fifteen percent answered that they were not accepted among their family members. Eight percent were conditionally accepted as part of their family. Nearly 3 percent were kicked out of their family homes, and 1.3 percent were forced to undergo psychological treatments. These statistics are just a snapshot of the realities that Thai men and women face today. It is clear that Thailand’s image of acceptance towards the LGBT community does not accurately demonstrate the prevailing conservative attitudes that still exist within the society.
In addition, the Thai civil-partnership bill is not without its flaws. The law would not permit same-sex couples to adopt or have custody of a child as a couple. So, one partner must file to adopt or have custody for a child instead.
On a broader note, focusing only on the Thai society prevents individuals from assessing the little progress Asia has made as a region. To this day, according to the Economist, Singapore has one of the harshest laws against homosexuality, criminalizing sexual acts between men in private or public.
And though the law itself is not actually enforced, the government has upheld the statute even after gay men challenged its constitutionality in 2007. Conservative sentiments remain prevalent in Malaysia and Indonesia as well. The Malaysian education ministry distributed guidelines to help parents notice homosexuality “symptoms” in their children. Pew Research has also found that 93 percent of Indonesians surveyed believed that LGBT “should not be accepted.”
Despite Thailand’s small steps to making legislation that would provide equal benefits for same-sex couples, its neighboring states continue to demonstrate less than accepting attitude towards homosexuals.
Though the Thai government has made significant progress in bringing forth the civil-partnership bill to the platform, over-glorifying the deed might blur the reality of the treatment of individuals in the Asian region.
