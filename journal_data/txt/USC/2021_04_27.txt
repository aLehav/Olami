Noel Tessier hoped she would at least experience USC’s welcome week in person. She could vividly picture herself jumping into the pool and dancing with the rest of her class at the midnight pool party. With her first year coming to an end, Tessier has only stepped foot on campus once as a USC student. Like the rest of her first year, Tessier attended her welcome week from home. 
No move-in day, gamedays or late nights at Taco Zone.
“I asked for less and less and less [of the freshman experience] until I realized that I would just be at home,” said Tessier, a freshman majoring in theatre.
Last spring, freshmen received their admission decisions in late March, during the pandemic. A time when students cheerfully post video reactions and photos of their acceptance letters on social media turned out to also be a moment filled with uncertainty: When will students be allowed to attend college in person?
“I was really disappointed because you spend your whole life planning for this, dreaming about this,” Tessier said. “My entire freshman year of college looked totally different from what I expected it to be, and it took a while for me to come to terms with that.”
The Class of 2024 was not the only one missing the traditional welcome experience.
Lavender Billingsley, a sophomore majoring in international relations, cried when she received her acceptance letter. She graduated high school early and transferred out of Santa Monica College to go to USC, a school that she and her mother dreamed for her to attend.
Staying in New Mexico with her family, Billingsley was eager to move back to Los Angeles. That quickly faded when the University retracted its plan for an in-person semester. Being back at home in New Mexico has been mentally and emotionally challenging, especially during Fall 2020, she said.
“To be honest, I just had to numb out the anticipation,” Billingsley said. “I’ve been so excited to go on campus, meet people, but I’ve just been so secluded. [I’m] just managing my own little world with the pandemic still going.” 
Although the freshman and transfer experience differs during a typical school year, the pandemic has made both groups feel disconnected from the campus community. 
Tessier attended an arts high school that did not have sports teams, so she looked forward to USC game days and feeling a sense of school spirit.
“When I was choosing my college, what school I wanted to go to, I wanted to make sure they had good teams because sports are so important to my family, and they’re so important to me,” Tessier said.
But due to coronavirus regulations, traditional tailgates were not permitted this academic year.
Some freshmen and transfer students have joined clubs online to find their place within the USC community.
Allan Josiah Bexton, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies, transferred to USC this semester but got involved the moment he got in a year ago. He currently serves as the undergraduate president of Queer Students in Cinematic Arts, an organization he helped revive last fall.
Bexton and the other executive board members meet weekly to advocate for queer representation in media and host community spaces to connect the USC queer community — but their relationship only exists virtually.
“[It’s] going to be a little surreal to actually see all these people in person and to put a face and a figure to them as well,” Bexton said.
For other students like Kameran Mody, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, clubs were not enough to feel connected. 
After joining a Facebook housing group and connecting with a few students on Instagram, Mody moved into a student housing complex just north of campus halfway through the fall semester.
“I realized if I were to move out here, I’d be able to move in with a couple of my friends,” Mody said. “I would be able to definitely reach out and have a little bit of a normal social life, so I can be able to have friends going into my sophomore year.” 
Moving did bring Mody more opportunities. He once met a group of USC students while playing a game of pickup basketball at the park near his apartment building. Afterward, they got tacos together.
“It’s just one of those experiences that you don’t get anymore because of [the coronavirus],” Mody said.
Tessier also had success making friends in person. On one of her days off from work, she visited campus to meet up with someone she met online while working on a project.
“She gave me a little tour of [USC] Village, then we saw Greek row, and then we got food,” Tessier said. “We did not stop talking, and it was less awkward than I expected it to be.”
On top of starting at a new school during the pandemic, first-year students had to adjust to USC’s academic rigor.
Before transferring, Bexton took 20 to 24 credits a semester while working two jobs. At USC, Bexton has no job but spends most of his time balancing 19 credits.
“I have had to struggle more than I did back in community college,” Bexton said. “It has definitely been demanding to say the least.”
Aside from academic difficulty, Mody said his virtual classes at the Viterbi School of Engineering do not compare to hands-on learning.
“It’s kind of funny because you think of engineering, you think of building stuff,” Mody said. “We have virtual labs where you’re a fake person, and you direct them around the station. It’s weird to think about, but I guess it’s the best we can do.”
Zoom classes in general also bring other challenges.
Billingsley says she enjoys the content of her classes, particularly her environmental studies ones, but she dropped one of them early on in the semester due to its online requirements.
“[The professor] was like, ‘You have to have your cameras on, you have to be in the frame 24/7.’ Like some kids don’t want to do that, so I dropped it,” Billingsley said. 
Tessier said she has overcome Zoom fatigue by finding ways to stay optimistic.
“Instead of thinking about what could have been, I’ve been trying to focus on what is. And in that way, it’s been really exciting, and I found little things that make me happy, like a group chat, even if it’s only active sometimes, it’s fun,” Tessier said.
But she still anticipates the day she can walk on campus and finally feel like a student.
“To just hang out, build memories … and have that ‘college experience,” Tessier said. “Even if it’s different, just to be in somebody’s space is beautiful. Even if we’re just sitting in my apartment. That’s what I’m really looking forward to — that human connection.”

The glorious end of the semester couldn’t come fast enough, but there’s still April to get through. Luckily, with new music being released left and right, it shouldn’t be that hard, right? Well, here are some tunes from April to help speed up this month and send good vibes heading into finals. 
“BORDER : CARNIVAL” by ENHYPEN
April 26 marked the first comeback for this K-pop boy group, formed by the seven finalists of survival reality show I-LAND. “BORDER : CARNIVAL,” surpassed 450,000 pre-sales, a new high for a group that debuted not even five months ago.
Enhypen exceeds what is expected of a rookie group. “Intro : The Invitation” is an ominous invitation into an album that parallels their first one. “Not for Sale” is this album’s “10 Months,” giving Enhypen’s vocals their time to shine in the frontline. The explosive lead track “Drunk-Dazed” makes you feel doozy in a good way, like the second vaccine dose, then “FEVER” heats it up more, also like the vaccine.
All in all, “BORDER : CARNIVAL” is like a carnival; there’s so much being offered. They cover vast ground in just six songs along with intricate, ankle-spraining choreography. With the oldest and youngest members being born in 2001 and 2005, respectively, Enhypen is an emerging group that has already accomplished more with their lives than we can even dream of. They’re a force to be reckoned with and climbing the ranks faster than you can say “radi ra ra ra.” 
“BORDER : CARNIVAL” is only one sample of that.
“DISHARMONY : BREAKOUT” by P1Harmony 
Like Enhypen, P1Harmony is a young and newbie K-pop boy group. Six months after their debut, the six members returned April 20 with their second mini album “DISHARMONY : BREAKOUT.” 
Hip-hop seems to be the album’s overarching concept, and P1Harmony does it well. The members of the vocal line proved themselves again in this mini album, but the true standouts were the rappers. They shined in the ear-shattering (in a good way) percussion and robotic funk sound, particularly in the title track “Scared.” The beats resemble clashing metal and are simultaneously disharmonious and harmonious to create a euphoric sensation.
Most of the six-track mini album is high-energy, but “If You Call Me” is a nice mellow finale to lower your blood pressure. P1Harmony formed during the pandemic and haven’t been able to host in-person concerts, but when it’s their time to, other artists should be “Scared.”
“Kiss Me More (feat. SZA)” by Doja Cat
The duo’s April 9 collaboration is the perfect song to gear up for a summer of resting and healing from this tumultuous year. No matter how many times this bubblegum pop finds its way onto your TikTok feed, “Kiss Me More” is sweet and refreshing each time with an addictive sprinkle of mature sensuality and innocence. 
“deja vu” by Olivia Rodrigo
Though released April 1, “deja vu” is no joke. It was hard to top “driver’s license,” but the 18-year-old singer-songwriter delivered with another catchy single. Instead of being an ‘I miss you’ song, “deja vu” is more of a ‘you miss me,’ and that’s the character development we like to see.
Olivia proved herself once again as a vocal and lyrical genius (“She thinks it’s special, but it’s all reused” / “Do you get deja vu when she’s with you?”), and the song’s hollow sound and unique chord progressions mesh well together. If you weren’t already anticipating May 21 for Rodrigo’s first album, start now. 
“Situation” by Ruth B.
Discovered on Vine from singing that one song about Peter Pan, Ruth B. released “Situation” April 16 as the first sneak peek into her second album, releasing June 11. The 25-year-old singer-songwriter displays a more mature side in this soft bedroom R&B pop. It starts out as a piano ballad then picks up with low-key hip hop beats, her voice husky, rich and healing throughout. Ruth B. is one Vine star that deserved her stardom.
“When I’m Older” by Ashe
When she’s not busy clowning One Direction fans, Ashe knocks it out of the park with her stellar vocals and reflective lyrics as seen in “When I’m Older,” released April 21. The choir at the beginning sets the ballad’s vulnerable tone and reflection of getting over and growing up from a past love. Described as “the last piece of the album puzzle” by the singer-songwriter herself, listeners are in for an emotional treat with her debut album, coming May 7.
“Sabotage” by Bebe Rexha
Following the upbeat “Sacrifice,” Bebe Rexha switches it up with the powerful ballad, released April 16. “Sabotage” is an impressive preview of Rexha’s forthcoming sophomore album, releasing May 7. Driven by the rich tones of piano, each verse adds additional layers of instrumentation to turn up the song’s intensity as Rexha sings with more power.
Likening herself to “the queen of burning bridges,” Rexha dives head first into her insecurity and calls out her self-destructive behavior, hitting listeners close to home in the process. But no matter how much this song resonates, don’t let it ring true during finals week.

If you ever want to feel like the main character of a coming-of-age movie, go on a late night bike ride. My roommate and I have been going on them a lot so we can savor the chill air blowing through our hair and a quietness that seems too good to be true in an urban city like Los Angeles. 
As we ride down the cross streets along 29th Street we are greeted by signs that read “Menlo,” “Ellendale” and “Orchard.” Truthfully I never really pay attention to them; I’ve passed them a million times and can name them without the help of Google Maps. However, there is one sign that I never fail to notice, even though I have also passed it too many times to count. 
It reads “Historic West Adams.”
I always read it to myself in my head, but I have never thought to look up the significance of the sign. Not until one day, the “Historic West Adams” that I have been living in for the past three years came up on my for you page in a TikTok by creator Jake Gotta (@jake_gotta). 
Jake Gotta’s bio puts it best when it says his TikTok account is a “crash course in housing and urban development.” In his video about West Adams, he gives a little history lesson on the famous residents that lived in the area as well as the racism that occurs in city planning. 
West Adams spans from Figueroa Street to Western Boulevard and is composed of many smaller neighborhoods. For instance, USC is a part of the University Park neighborhood.
While there is a lot of history to unpack about the Historic West Adams District, Gotta’s TikTok explains the history of the neighborhood where Hattie McDaniel, the first Black person to win an Academy Award for her supporting role in “Gone With The Wind,” settled in the 1940s. 
Gotta said, “[This neighborhood] became the center of Black Hollywood. Actors, musicians and business men and women alike flocked to West Adams and renamed this area ‘Sugarhill.’”
McDaniel was a trendsetter in moving to this area. She created an area where Black creators in the industry had a community filled with like-minded individuals. To no surprise, however, many of the white neighbors weren’t too happy about this. 
“When their white neighbors sued to evict them,” Gotta explained. “They hired civil rights lawyer and activist Bayard Rustin to defend them. He successfully argued in court that racial housing covenants violated the 14th Amendment.”
This isn’t the only racism that the residents of Sugarhill would face. As Gotta shares, even these wealthy individuals could not prevent the construction of the I-10 freeway right through their neighborhood. 
In a previous TikTok, Gotta told his viewers about how the white residents of South Pasadena were able to prevent the construction of the 710 freeway into their neighborhood — a luxury that is often not afforded to neighborhoods where people of color predominantly reside. 
Freeways serve as a way to separate white neighborhoods from their non-white counterparts. They are most often constructed in areas where there is existing housing, thus forcing families to be evicted from their homes. Last, but certainly not least, they are hot spots for horrible air pollution. 
While the wealthy, white population of South Pasadena was able to prevent a freeway from evicting residents and businesses from their homes, the wealthy, Black population of Sugarhill couldn’t prevent a freeway from being built near theirs. 
As Gotta explains, this exemplifies perfectly how these projects of urban development have nothing to do with wealth and everything to do with race. 
Simply put, city planning and development have always been used as subtle forms of racism and segregation, especially in L.A. 
As an institution, USC has played its part in gentrifying and urban planning that has similarly created a separating line between the university and its surrounding communities. Thus, as students coming from all over the world to USC, we must recognize that we are visitors in this West Adams community and do our part to foster a relationship with the community that has made it historic.

What started as a 30-day songwriting challenge ended up producing Colombian American singer-songwriter Carlo Rincón’s debut single “Hot Lemonade” and his most recent release “Home Again” that just landed itself on the Fresh Finds: Indie Spotify playlist.
A self-taught pianist, guitarist, vocalist and producer, growing up, it was only a matter of time before Rincón had written his first song in the eighth grade. From there, one musical spark ignited a whole symphony within him, and he went on to write two albums while in high school. 
Rincón’s longtime best friend, Paul Gutierrez, a junior majoring in creative producing at Chapman University said, “the sky’s the limit for him.” 
“Having been around him for four years singing every day together, he has an incredible voice [and] incredible range,” Gutirrez said. “He’s a really great live performer, so I can imagine him doing a lot of live shows.” 
Now a junior majoring in music industry, the 21-year-old indie-folk singer, born and raised in Denver, Colo., goes by the name San Andrea. Since he lives in Los Angeles, many have thought that his alias comes from the Southern California San Andreas Fault Line. 
However, it’s significance and origin is one with a story much more personal to Rincón. 
His middle name “Andrea” comes from the famous Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli, who his mother named him after.
Often mispronounced, Rincón wanted to own his middle name and chose to go by the stage name “San Andrea” partly because of its personal connection but also because of his family background and as a dedication to a place that hits close to home for the singer.
“There’s this island off the coast of Colombia, called San Andrés, and we used to go there all the time growing up,” Rincón said. “It has a lot of positive memories and good meaning with my family.”
Through every word he sings, Rincón creates a nostalgic, vulnerable and sentimental atmosphere. Taking inspiration from artists such as Bon Iver, Gregory Alan Isakov, Novo Amor and JP Saxe, Rincón wants his words, as much as his sound, to resonate with listeners. 
“Because I’m a lyricist and because I focus on what I have to say, I want people to find different ways of thinking about how they’re feeling so that [it] can be easier to work with it,” Rincón said.
Not only does Rincón write his own music, he also does all of his own marketing, logos, posters and merchandise. He’s even helped fellow artists with their marketing strategies — writing press releases, designing posts for social media and creating videos to accompany their music. 
“He’s just an extremely kind and caring person [and] with my own music, he’s helped me so much,” Gutierrez said.  
When it came to the 30-day songwriting challenge he started in October 2019, Rincón said, “It got me in this groove of, not even writing things that I would necessarily first think of but just what other people thought of.” 
Each day that month, Rincón would ask his followers to send in one-word prompts for him to write a song about. 
After a friend jokingly requested he write a song using the word “lemons,” Rincón went on to write his debut single “Hot Lemonade,” which was written in a day and came out in mid-July 2020. The song is a light-hearted homage to his younger self. In it, hot lemonade is the metaphor for something going awry in a relationship without being able to put your finger on why or what it is that caused the disruption.  
“Maybe you’re in this relationship and everything is going right, you’re moving along good, but then you take a sip, and you start to fall [and you] get to know them a little bit more, then something throws you off,” Rincón said. 
Devon Oakley, a junior majoring in music production, who mixed and mastered both “Hot Lemonade” and “Home Again,” met Rincón in a music industry class last year. The two quickly hit it off and began collaborating.
“Carlo really tries to make music that will have an effect on people and is from his own personal experience and his own heart, so I really appreciate that about what he tries to create,” Oakley said. 
Like many young adults heading to college, soon-to-be graduating or figuring out their direction in life, Rincón’s song “Home Again,” released January, comes from a more serious space and is a dedication to his family and hometown. 
“I think it also is a song about growing up and reflecting on your past and that time where you’re in between two places,” Rincón said. 
Starting out as a biology major his freshman year, Rincón didn’t feel that he was on the right path to where he wanted to go with his future. Thinking about his mother’s wise words and how she’d built her own acting company, Visionbox Studios, from the ground up, Rincón felt encouraged to pursue what he’s most passionate about and switch his major.  
“There are times where I’m scared shitless about what I am going to do after college, but I feel like, regardless of what you’re studying, everyone’s worried about that,” Rincón said. 
At USC, he said, “it doesn’t seem far-fetched to dream about what you want.”
Destined to pursue a career in music, shortly after “Hot Lemonade,” Rincón wrote “Home Again,” which is about missing the place you’re from and going back to the memories in your mind that remind you of home. 
“[I was thinking to myself] ‘Why did I think that moving to the sun was going to be what I wanted?’ I love the snow, and it just felt like everything was so opposite,” Rincón said. 
“Home Again” was a way of reflecting on what he was feeling at the time, being tied between two places.
“I was really in search of what I wanted, and I still am, and I think ‘Home Again’ was [a] way to reflect that,” Rincón said. 
A perfect pairing to the song, the music video for “Home Again” features clips from Rincón’s childhood — everything from blowing out birthday candles to making snow angels in the sand at the beach. 
“I’m super grateful that my dad and mom took so many home videos because I was able to make … a whole compilation of [myself] growing up and see it happen in almost five minutes,” Rincón said. 
Rincón hopes to release more music later this year and continues to write and form collaborative relationships with fellow musicians and producers. 
“It’s clear when people are in it for the art of it, and he’s certainly that,” Gutierrez said.

Writer’s Note: While looking for sources to speak to in regard to this article, I attended a Wednesday evening meeting of the Student Assembly for Accessibility, a newly incorporated assembly under the Undergraduate Student Government, dropping by for a quick plug before letting them get back to their painting event. I was instantly stunned, watching the screen fill with squares including attendees, assembly leadership and — most prominently — student interpreters. 
I’d never seen this in any form before, and as a disabled student, I wonder how quickly we can move forward in implementing these accessibility features for everyone to foster a conducive academic environment.
The time to ameliorate the lack of disability awareness and education is now. 
When Gigi Robinson gained admittance to USC as a sophomore in 2017, she started planning early. Over summer break, she took the time to research USC’s Disability Services & Programs and submit her 504 Plan, a colloquial term for the documentation that secures learning accommodations for students with disabilities.  
As a person with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a family of inherited conditions that affect the body’s connective tissue, Robinson didn’t experience many flare-ups of chronic pain in high school or at her previous college. Arriving at USC changed that.
Now a graduate student in the Iovine and Young Academy, Robinson completed her Bachelor’s of Fine Arts in design and photography in December. Along the way, many of the issues she faced related to her condition came at the hands of her own professors at the Roski School of Art and Design. 
“I experienced issues primarily with my art professors,” Robinson said. “And I think, it’s really kind of unique because from conversations I’d had with them, it was almost like so many kids play hooky all the time or they play sick or whatever. But the professors in the art school have kind of lost track of like, ‘How can you believe a student, you know, unless you can visibly see what’s going on?’”
Questioning her condition was a repeat occurrence by her professors, Robinson said, despite being registered with DSP. 
“I don’t want to go as far as to say public humiliation, but in one of my classes my professor didn’t believe I had a condition,” Robinson said.
In her first year at USC, her beginning drawing instructor saw no reason to accommodate Robinson’s condition, which in part makes it difficult for her to write.
“When I tried to tell my professor about it, she was like, ‘Oh nothing was wrong, I don’t believe you, like come on, try harder, you’re not trying hard enough,’” Robinson said. “It felt like this teacher just didn’t want to believe, and she didn’t want to help me come up with alternatives for my condition.”
For her final project in the drawing class, Robinson compiled her CAT scans into a conceptual art piece that used the perspective of a mountain landscape through a mirror of a car to reflect on her illness, illustrating some peaks that have been crossed and some that have not yet been crossed. 
In a photography class with another unwavering professor, who required handwritten notes and didn’t accept a DSP note explaining the difficulties Robinson had with that format, she created a project of portraits from an EDS support group meeting of individuals posing with various mobility devices and medications that they brought with them. Seeing some reprieve as the project “pretty much shut her [professor] up,” Robinson dove deeper into incorporating the viscerality of her condition in her artwork. 
“I wanted to do a further iteration on the experience as a chronically ill person,” Robinson said. “I didn’t know what it would like, I didn’t know how to really do it, and the professors just kept saying ‘No, you’ve already done this, we don’t want you to do this, you’ve done this work, why can’t you do something else.’ I was like, because this is what I’m passionate about and it’s what I have a lot of trouble with.”
Taking a medically reduced course load in Spring and Fall 2020 through the bulk of the pandemic, her initial faculty adviser encouraged her to drop the senior thesis class, the concern stemming from projections Robinson’s professors had of her abilities. After petitioning to get a new adviser, her thesis was born. 
“I was really bamboozled at the fact that these professors could be that shallow for people that are supposed to be conceptual artists,” Robinson said.
Holly McCauley, a sophomore majoring in English literature, has had a completely opposite experience to Robinson’s in terms of her major-specific classes.
“Last semester, I just had a rut where I just didn’t want to do anything, it felt like [the coronavirus] was never ending,” McCauley said. “I did have several professors, all in the English department, reach out to me and be like, ‘Are you OK, like what’s going on?’ And I really think it’s because it’s smaller classes, and smaller classes leads you to have stronger relationships with professors.”
In the 2020-21 school year, USC has 19,500 undergraduates of the total 46,000 students attending. Boasting an average class size of 26 students and an 8:1 student to faculty ratio, it seems that most classes should provide the foundation for strong student-teacher bonds. You get a mixed bag of results, with some professors passing the work over to DSP.
The office and its objectives
When support was sparse to find with Roski’s academic leadership, Robinson leaned on the support of her disability officer, who backed her up when professors would call with doubts along with when she took on a medically reduced course load senior year. 
Melody Brown-Clark, a senior majoring in neuroscience, is appreciative of DSP’s role in shaping her college life from the beginning. 
The key factor for Brown-Clark in choosing to attend USC was the ability to secure a single room and private bathroom, so as to provide comfort when her ulcerative colitis was severe.
“I contacted disability services as soon as I was accepted, and I was able to be accommodated with a single room and private bathroom in McCarthy my freshman year, and then later a single room and (almost) private bathroom in Ilium my sophomore year,” Brown-Clark wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “This was genuinely a very large reason that I settled on USC over another school that I was considering.”
In addition for Brown-Clark, experiencing postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, which can cause nausea or dizziness when standing up, facilitates the need of a comfortable learning and classroom environment.
Debbie Jih, interim director of DSP, illustrated the office’s constraints in bridging the student-teacher gap while simultaneously advocating for greater inclusion. 
“If the specialist feels that it’s within their scope to be able to reach out to the professor … we might reach out and say ‘Hey, this happened, what are the different options available for the student,’” Jih said.
With a professional background in psychology and mental health, Jih recognizes the office’s responsibility in supporting each student rather than a single disability type, an individualized strategy that has remained throughout the coronavirus’ reaches. 
But online learning has posed new and unique difficulties for the office and students, including testing accommodations. 
“Some professors … turned on no backtracking for students, which could be challenging for students with limitations related to visual tracking, attention, concentration, so … those are individual case-by-case situations where we meet with the students who really get an understanding of their disability and the limitations,” Jih said. “From there, it may be that we approve additional accommodations where we really haven’t had before, prior to being online.”
McCauley, who is hard of hearing, said that online learning without captioning being professionally done rather than auto-generated, can be confusing and frustrating to follow. One of her Thematic Option professors, Edwin McCann, set a positive example for her by allowing students to view video assignments outside of class with their own accessibility features. 
“If you are going to caption videos to be able to have like, audio descriptions, or whatever it is to make sure that all students can watch your video and hear your video, because otherwise everyone else in the class gets to watch it and a few students don’t, and they’re just not getting the same education that everyone else is,” McCauley said. “And that’s the base definition of inequality.”
The pandemic has shown DSP the lasting advantages and disadvantages to online learning. While asynchronous learning or a virtual learning option is still under discussion between University administrators, the office is prepared to accommodate students in the best ways they can. 
“If there are students with a disability that significantly impacts their stamina in attending class, we still, even before the pandemic, we work with those students individually to determine what the best support is, what’s a reasonable accommodation for those students,” Jih said. “So it’s not that, you know, we would say, you must or have to take class in person 100% right, it still depends on the student and their limitations related to their disability.”
Finding community in the crowd
Regardless of how a student chooses to interact with the University administration with regard to their condition, connecting with similarly situated students can be a whole different ball game. 
Robinson, who enrolled in IYA for the semester following her bachelor’s completion, had trouble identifying where to go for that sort of camaraderie. 
“I honestly, as a disabled student, I didn’t really know where to look for that kind of community on campus,” Robinson said. “And I will say, especially I think another thing for me about my like disability and chronic condition is that I only really recently have identified as disabled, and it came around that time, where my professors were acting really ableist around me but that said I had no idea of any organization, other than the disability students service center DSP to look for guidance, I didn’t know where to find friends with other conditions.”
Participating in disability advocacy in high school, McCauley immediately saw an opportunity when she spotted the Undergraduate Student Government table at the involvement fair freshman year. There, she heard from the founders of the Student Assembly for Accessibility, including her current co-director Javin D’Souza and Gabrielle Afflick, and jumped right to work before the pandemic hit.
“We just recently became incorporated as an assembly, and we basically reverted back … to the budget that we had pre-incorporation,” McCauley said. “So we were working on a budget that we’ve done before, and it wasn’t impossible for us, it wasn’t nearly as bad as Concerts Committee or something like that that had a huge budget, because to begin with, we didn’t have that much to work with and I think being an assembly that focused on community building, there’s a lot of stuff we can do for cheap.”
Brown-Clark found her own little collective when the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment hosted a talk with “The Good Place” actress Jameela Jamil, who has EDS as well.
“I asked her a question about EDS during the event, and two of my acquaintances from USC who were there and heard me ask the question reached out to me and said that they also had EDS, so we’ve formed our own little community that we just happened to stumble into,” Brown-Clark wrote. “It would have been really nice if there had been some sort of organized way to get support from other students with the same issues before then, though.”
Community-building can be difficult when many students are not aware that their condition or situation can be accommodated by DSP and the University. In Fall 2019, only 6.7% of USC students were registered with the office — speaking to a lack of disability awareness and education from administrators to connect students with the proper help. 
While the Office of Health Promotion Strategy administers its annual Healthy Minds survey, DSP is already looking at how to track performance and well-being indicators with the new DSP Student Well-Being initiative. 
“So there is a scale for a sense of belonging,” Jih said. “We’re looking at incorporating some of this data into DSP work and how DSP is able to consistently and routinely track gathered data to ensure that we are making sure that students are connected with resources right away, once we learn that there may be some challenges or lower sense of well being, or resiliency.”
Between running an IGTV series, teaching Roski and Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism students and guiding social media literacy, Robinson sees the future of accessibility in her hands. For USC, she says learning those nuances early can improve the outlook of professors and students alike. 
“I really hope there’s some kind of disability, or mental health and well-being trainings that the professors can go through, so that they can not only be resources, but they can also be more understanding and hopefully like, there won’t be these issues because like what I went through was just awful,” Robinson said. “It was really awful and it consumed me and it made me feel my work wasn’t worthy and as an artist, that’s one of the most invalidating things you know?”
Brown-Clark isn’t capitulating to less accommodating measures for learning ever again.
“Online learning has taught me that I will no longer accept classes not being recorded ever again,” Brown-Clark wrote. “There were so many days when I dragged myself to class because I didn’t want to miss the information, even though my body was begging me not to, and I wouldn’t have had to do that had the classes been streamed or recorded in the first place.” 
McCauley sees USC’s improvements beginning with an open line of communication and the same student tenacity as Brown-Clark’s. 
“I think they want people to believe that they have an open ear and I think they are trying, but it’s difficult, because a lot of students have a ton of different needs,” McCauley said. “And I do think they’re trying their best, I think they could do better. It’s up to the students that are immunocompromised or have these other conditions to fight for themselves and advocate for what they need. And that’s irritating, but if students are willing to advocate for themselves that an admin is willing to listen, they’re not going to go out of their way to do it on their own.”

The No. 10 women’s golf team won the Pac-12 championship this weekend with a 3-under par team score of 849. This is the Trojans second straight Pac-12 title after winning in 2019. 
The Trojans won their last regular season tournament at the Silverado Showdown in Silicon Valley earlier this month. 
USC put themselves in first place on the first day of the tournament Friday and held that spot through the end of the weekend. All five of the Trojans finished in the top 20 individually.  
Leading USC was senior Amelia Garvey, who finished in second with a 5-under 208, and junior Malia Nam who tied for third with a 4-under 209. Freshman Rachel Heck from Stanford finished in first place with a 7-under 206, just two strokes ahead of Garvey. 
“That’s an amazing finish for her,” Garvey said of Nam’s performance. “She missed a couple of teams at the start of the year, so it’s nice to give her the confidence and see her start playing well again heading into the middle of the postseason now.”
Nam had four starts and two top 3 finishes this season, including the Pac-12 championship. 
Garvey was also confident about her own return to form.
 “Earlier in the season I was just getting used to playing competitive golf again,” Garvey said. “I had over 10 months off when I went home to New Zealand for [the coronavirus], so it was kind of getting in those reps again, and now I’m starting to see that pay off.”
Although the Trojans held the lead throughout the tournament their win came at a close margin. The team posted the lowest score on Friday of 283 but performed worse than both Stanford and Arizona State in the second round while still managing to stay in first place. 
The Trojans maintained their confidence despite the second round slump. 
“We knew we didn’t play our best coming into the final round,” senior Alyaa Abdulghany said. “But I had a lot of faith in this team and I knew we could get it done.”
Ultimately, USC and Stanford tied the third and final round with a 5-under 279. The Cardinal finished the tournament five strokes off of the Trojans with a 2-over 854. 
The weather also proved to be an obstacle on Sunday. 
“I’m really proud of the team for the way they pulled through in really tough conditions,” Garvey said. “It was probably one of the windiest days out of the three.”  
As a top 10 team, the pressure has been intensifying for the Trojans during the postseason. But, they remain confident heading into the final rounds of the season in May.
“It’s kind of like a knock out round now, but this team handles pressure so well we don’t really think about that too much and are so confident in our ability to get things done,” Abdulghany said. “We’re just trying to stick to our process as much as we can, and everything will go our way.” 
USC will advance to the NCAA regional championships on May 10. The NCAA will announce the Trojans’ regional assignment Wednesday.

Baseball was swept by No. 18 ranked Arizona over the weekend in Tucson, Ariz.
The Trojans are now 18-16 as they enter the final month of the season while these wins bring Arizona to a formidable record of 27-11.  
In the series opener sophomore first baseman Clay Owens started off the weekend with a home run after he hit two against LMU last Tuesday. The sophomore leads the team with 33 RBIs this season. 
Arizona came back hot in the fourth inning, putting up seven unanswered runs on the Trojans. Freshman outfielder Mac Bingham hit a two RBI triple for the Wildcats against redshirt junior pitcher Isaac Esqueda to end the inning. 
After Arizona’s scoring spree, the Trojans began to chip away at the lead. A two RBI double from freshman outfielder Rhylan Thomas and another homer by Owens brought the score to 8-5, but the Wildcat’s lead proved insurmountable. 
The Trojans were .500 in Pac-12 play before this game, but the loss gave them a losing record of 6-7. 
Thomas’s performance was a small bright spot in a tough loss. The freshman has been hot behind the plate and rode a seven-game hitting streak into this weekend. 
On Saturday, the Trojans started off slow defensively. Arizona was up 3-0 after the second inning following doubles hit by freshman third baseman Jacob Berry and sophomore infielder Nik McClaughry. USC came back slowly and took the lead 4-3 in the fifth inning on a two RBI single by junior infielder Ben Ramirez. 
Ramirez has been fantastic at the plate recently. He had five home runs in seven games coming into the series against Arizona.
The game was tied 5-5 entering the seventh inning. Ramirez brought in another run to take the lead. After, the Wildcats shifted into high gear, scoring five runs in the bottom of the seventh. Homers by two freshmen, catcher Daniel Susac and third baseman Jacob Berry, solidified the 10-6 win and clinched the series for Arizona. 
In Sunday’s game, USC managed to keep up with the Wildcats in the beginning. Arizona scored on a pitching error by sophomore pitcher Alex Cornwell. USC tied the game in the top of the second, but the Wildcats added three runs in the bottom. After a scoring drought from both teams, the score was 4-1 Arizona entering the fifth inning. Ramirez stayed hot at the plate this game, hitting an RBI in the fifth and seventh innings. 
However, USC could not keep up with the Wildcat offense. After freshman catcher Daniel Susac’s two-RBI single for Arizona, the score was 7-2 entering the seventh inning. The final score was 8-4 after Owens batted in a run in the bottom of the seventh. The Trojans look to rebound from the tough weekend series against Pepperdine on Tuesday. USC lost their first game against Pepperdine on March 6, and their second game got canceled, which means this match will be a chance to tie the series. First pitch is at 6 p.m. at Dedeaux Field.

Women’s tennis lost to Arizona State in the quarterfinals Friday, knocking them out of contention for the Pac-12 Championship. USC fell 4-3 in a close match in spite of winning the doubles point.
The Trojans were able to avoid a first-round of play with a No. 5 overall seeding, one place behind the Sun Devils, setting up this quarterfinal match between a team USC had defeated a few weeks prior.
However, despite the victory USC pulled off last time by playing extremely dominant singles after dropping the doubles point, the team wasn’t able to keep pace in the later stages of their most recent meeting with the Sun Devils.
Redshirt senior Summer Dvorak and junior Danielle Wilson swept away the Arizona doubles pair opponent in a 6-1 victory. Their win was echoed by a second 6-1 doubles win from sophomore Eryn Cayetano and redshirt senior Anglea Kulikov cementing the doubles point for USC.
USC’s dominant doubles point win took all of the highlights from their first-time meeting with ASU. Dvorak, while playing with a different partner during the match with the Sun Devils on April 3, was able to etch out the first doubles win both times. Cayetano and Kulikov’s win was a reversal of a loss to that same pair in Tempe, Ariz. USC was able to avoid a tie break by a long shot during championship play, which handed them their doubles point loss the first time around.  
Doubles point in hand, USC had some serious cushion, but it didn’t last long.
In a stark reversal of their last meeting with ASU, USC lost five of the six opening sets in singles play. This was notably the Trojans turning point in the previous meeting with ASU, when they did the same thing to the Sun Devils in Tempe.
The first loss, and point to the Sun Devils came when freshman Naomi Cheong retired following a first set loss.
Despite being the eventual winners, ASU was first to come within a point of the match when a win over USC’s top singles player, junior Salma Ewing, let the Sun Devils get a 3-2 lead. Ewing lost in straight sets, although showing some resiliency in the eventual 6-4, 6-3 loss, battling to 3-4 in the second while being down 1-4.
It took USC three match points to get in clinching position. Cayetano, the only player to push their match to three sets, dropped the first set but won on her third match point.
USC’s comeback ended in an exchange of breaks that favored the Sun Devils in the final match of the day between Dvorak and ASU freshman Marianna Argyrokastriti. Dvorak lost in a first set tiebreak before falling 7-6, 6-4 to send ASU on to the semifinals.
ASU’s win was a combination of perseverance and USC being unable to capitalize on opportunity or hold serve.
In Dvorak’s singles loss, she was able to defend two match points on return. However, when back on serve, at 4-5 and up 40-15, she wasn’t able to close the game, letting Argyrokastriti win the match on a deuce point return.
Ewing’s match fell on her racket as well, giving Ilze Hattingh three match points while down 3-5. Ewing lost on the first one.
While USC’s hopes for the Pac-12 Championship have ended, they now await the NCAA Selection Show on May 3 for a chance to compete for the national title.

President Carol Folt highlighted the achievements of USC students, staff and faculty, and discussed next steps for the University, including plans to require vaccines for the Fall 2021 semester, at the virtual State of the University address Monday. 
Folt began the event by discussing the University’s shift to a virtual format in March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, and thanked faculty and staff who led the University’s internal coronavirus response efforts, financial donors and medical personnel. 
“We flipped more than 7000 classes in three days, retooled our operations to meet COVID safety standards, shuttered residence halls, retail operations, hundreds of competitions, shows, galas and other events,” Folt said. “We had to make some tough decisions, painful decisions even, but they were the right ones.” 
Throughout the course of the pandemic, the University administered approximately 180,000 coronavirus tests and distributed 50,000 vaccines, and opened the largest vaccination site in East Los Angeles. They also distributed 700,000 units of personal protective equipment and six million pounds of food to those in need. The University also covered the full cost of the tests, vaccines, upgraded safety measures and extra financial aid support, which amounted to $97 million. 
Folt also said that the University intends to require vaccines for the Fall 2021 semester. 
“We have to make sure that people have access to [the vaccines]. We’re doing all that, but it is our intent to make them required,” Folt said. “Of course, we will have exceptions, and we’ll make good explanations for people that have medical or religious reasons that would make it not possible for them.” 
Folt also mentioned the University’s efforts towards increased diversity, equity and inclusion. Last August, she posted six calls to action for this year, and according to Folt, the University has “completed or [is] about to complete all of them.” These included the hiring of the University’s first chief inclusion and diversity officer, Christopher Manning, and the establishment of a community advisory board for the University’s Department of Public Safety. 
The University also created a Racial, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion taskforce, whose recommendations “touch nearly every corner of the Trojan community.” In the Fall 2021 semester, a renovated physical space for first-generation, transfer and undocumented students is set to open, as well as a planned launch of unconscious bias training for faculty and staff. 
The University’s work on sustainability was also discussed. According to Folt, the University’s sustainability goals will be outlined in the “soon to be released” USC 2028 sustainability plan. She mentioned the University’s possible involvement in Mayor Eric Garcetti’s plan for sustainability, and the country’s “renewed focus on climate change and the disparities in health and wealth that it exacerbates.” Folt also mentioned the effect that students had in pushing for change regarding environmental issues. 
“We’ve seen their ideas to reduce waste, divest from fossil fuels, lower carbon emissions and pursue environmental justice, and so much more,” Folt said. “They are amazing and persuasive, and their passion for change propels me every single day.”  
At the end of her address, Folt conducted a Q&A open to all attendees. 
Some students asked about USC’s plans for paying the $1.1 billion in settlements to end further litigation in the George Tyndall sex abuse lawsuits and in payouts to Tyndalls’s former patients, the largest sex abuse settlement against a university in history.
“I talked about things like selling off non-essential assets,” Folt said. “We can restructure our leases. Loans are at a very low interest right now. We can use money like that to save if we are able to restructure loans. We can also delay capital projects … In any case, though, we know that we can cover it and we also know that we can do it without detracting from our academic mission.”
Folt hinted that on-campus living and activities will open up to a larger number of students in the Fall.
“We’ll go through the normal process of getting placements, depending on what our density requirements are and if students are vaccinated, of course, things get a lot easier,” Folt said. “There’s going to be a lot going on in all the student activities and clubs, probably some of them will be hybrid between in-person activities and activities that are online.”
Folt said that the University’s goal is to “make people feel as welcome and oriented — whether they started last year under the pandemic, or this year, as we come out of it.” 
“I’m looking forward to greeting everyone when we’re going to do that,” Folt said. “We will look forward to seeing you in person, very very soon.”

After experiencing both her friend’s mother and her uncle pass away without wills and witnessing the challenges that come with that, alumna Emma Reynolds began investigating the reason why some people do not have wills. Upon learning that, for many people, the decision to not have a will came from high costs and the process posing a burden, Reynolds co-founded Heirloom — a platform that makes it simpler and more affordable to create wills that are reviewed for error by attorneys.
Reynolds graduated with a master’s degree from Iovine and Young Academy in 2020 where she met one of her co-founders, alumni Ben Carpel. After meeting and aligning interests in their technology foundations class, Reynolds and Carpel decided to turn their school project into reality. Starting their project by first scheduling meetings as a team of three co-founders to develop their idea in March 2020, Heirloom officially launched in February. 
The name Heirloom comes from the varying preferences of what people would like to do with their body and belongings following their death, Carpel said. Some people want to designate care for certain people or pets, so their name and belongings are cherished and live on in their will.
“This [Heirloom] is something we want to be living, breathing, updated in real time with you, but it lives on beyond you,” Carpel said. “It becomes an heirloom for your loved ones to kind of be part of and see.”
Before the project’s official launch, Reynolds said she went into her master’s program with a broad idea about what she wanted her unnamed company to be at the time. She pitched her idea, prototyped her product and received input from classmates and professors throughout her two years at USC. 
Three of the professors that stood out to Reynolds were Jay Clewis, Chris Swain and Michael Crowley. These professors provided feedback and provocative questions that pushed Reynolds.
Currently, the start-up has had three customers complete the whole process of creating a will on the Heirloom website — each of which costs $299 to make.
A customer starts by filling out a questionnaire that takes five to 10 minutes. Your answers are then reviewed by a lawyer. Part of Heirloom’s value proposition is that every will gets reviewed by a licensed attorney. 
Reynolds said that while DIY wills are easy to do online for a cheaper price, they’re not all reviewed by a licensed attorney. In contrast, if you go to a traditional law firm, you can pay around $1000. If a will is not looked over by a lawyer, there is room for error.
“A lot of people make mistakes, even a comma. If you put a comma in the wrong place, that can change your intent, and then your will becomes contestable,” Reynolds said.
Since each state has different laws, Heirloom has a contract with individual lawyers from various states to review a customer’s will. On the Heirloom website, customers get assigned an attorney to review their will and are able to message them through their Heirloom profile. Since the company was founded in California, the company is currently only focusing on California.
“All the advertising we’re doing [is] focused on California because our license attorneys are set up [here] and the templates and everything [are] for California,” Reynolds said. “We’re quickly building for the other states … We’ve been doing Facebook advertising and various targeting on Google, but we’ve had our first few customers and we’re getting good feedback.”
As the start-up grew from the ground up, the Heirloom team faced many challenges when creating their business model, Reynolds said. She contemplated if they should charge people a subscription fee, a one time fee or if any fees would be too expensive for people. The team also debated if they should work with lawyers or work without them, and mimic a DIY style will.
“Our biggest challenge is getting people to do something they do not want to do because no one wants to think about their death,” Reynolds said. “And so we’ve got a real uphill battle to get people to say, ‘This is important. I’m going to do it and I’m going to sit down and do it now.’”
Carpel said that currently, one of the challenges Heirloom will face is with customer security. Since storing people’s personal information these days is common, the Heirloom team is trying to figure out a way for customers to not feel wary about sharing their information.
“It’s [asking], how do we make the journeys so simple and easy that no one feels any trepidation about putting their email in or putting their information in,” Carpel said. “This is the act of document that every single human being needs. But how do we make that so easy that no one feels fearful about signing up?”
Carpel said Heirloom received beta testing feedback from attorneys who tested the process of being in a customer’s shoes before the application was launched to test user experience.
“Us having the humility to say we don’t know what we don’t know [was important]. And ‘Let’s talk to some experts and some real people to design a product and service with their needs in mind,’” Carpel said. “It was built in a way where we can evolve it and change it if those needs need to be changed in the future.”
When Carpel met with Reynolds at IYA, Carpel also brought Justin Hicks, a graduate from Mississippi State University, onto the team as a co-founder to handle the technology side of Heirloom. Hicks said that while he has seen the success of prior startups, Heirloom is different as he feels there is an emotional connection to wills.
“This is something that affects people’s lives pretty directly,” Hicks said. “[I] signed on not having a will, but knowing I needed one. And what better way to do that than to build it and actually use the product myself.”
The Heirloom team has operated completely online and through Zoom. Hicks said the three team members have yet to all meet in person.
Prior to Heirloom, Reynolds had no prior knowledge of the legal matters to create a will. Through research, asking classmates about their knowledge, talking to estate lawyers across the country and speaking with estate planning firms, Reynolds found ways to educate herself.
“This is now my third business in the inner space in legal tech that I don’t have any prior experience in,” Reynolds said. “I can prove that you don’t need to have experience in the sector you can learn it. And if you’re passionate about solving a problem, you can come in and be a disruptor.”

The fight for women’s exposure and equality in sports is ongoing. It still has a long way to go. 
On April 16, the No. 18 women’s soccer team faced off in their final game of the season against ranked No. 5 rival UCLA. The highly anticipated game came after the Women of Troy came close to defeating them in their last matchup against the Bruins, who were undefeated at the time before losing to Arizona State University the day after. 
There was another game to be played the next day by the football team as they got ready to perform in the spring showcase. This game was not a regular-season game but a game to showcase where the teams are heading into the offseason leading up to their 2021 season opener. 
Both games were to be played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, so there was not an issue of seating fans. But, both teams did not receive the same allotted amount of allowed attendance. 
The spring football showcase allowed 5,000 fans to enter the Coliseum to watch the scrimmage which encompassed fans, media and family. 
The same was not allowed for the women’s soccer team. The number did not compare to the showcase. The women’s soccer team was only allowed to have four fans per player — the women’s soccer team roster is less than half the size of the men’s football roster. 
At a time when women are standing up and using their voices to advocate for the same rights as their male counterparts, situations such as this demonstrates where the priority lies for universities. 
It is not fair that a team who is going to the playoffs could not have more than four fans per player for their game in the same venue as the football team. 
Consistently, it is shown how much more work has to be done for women in sports to be seen and heard when wanting the attention for the game they love, and equal treatment as the other athletes representing the school. 
Equal seating is not too much to ask for, and it should not have been a situation where favoritism was displayed in that manner. 
Women’s sports cannot grow to their highest potential without the exposure and attendance of fans that want to support these women as they play. 
The women’s soccer team put on another hard-fought game to force the Bruins to a 2-2 draw and head into the playoffs with confidence that they will go far. But, students and fans would not know this because of the seating limitations. The only way to support the team is to let the fans come watch them. 
If 5,000 football fans could follow coronavirus health protocols while sitting in the Coliseum with their mask and 6-feet social distancing while watching the scrimmage, then the same should have been permitted for the women’s soccer team. 
Despite how some may feel in terms of which sports generate more money, it is not about the money. Instead, it is about the respect and dignity these women athletes deserve. 
The failure on the part of the University to further push the advocacy of women’s work continues to reinforce the inequality for women. In the United States, women are paid less and are systematically under-appreciated. Instead of standing with the women at the forefront, they have succumbed to their favoritism towards men athletics. 
This issue is not only on a university level but on a professional level. For example the U.S. women’s soccer team recently reached a partial settlement for better wages and working conditions for the World-Cup winning team. The lawsuit occurred in March 2019 and two years later proves why the team continued to fight for the justice and fair treatment that they deserve. 
There is no excuse for the visible display of disrespect and discouragement towards women in sports. It is time to stop the contradictions and show actual effort in the expansion of women athletes. They deserve better and shouldn’t have to ask for it.
