In what was effectively a must-win game to avoid the play-in round for the Pac-10 Tournament, the USC men’s basketball team answered the bell, downing Oregon State 67-56.
Inside presence · Junior forward Nikola Vucevic finished with his 12th double-double of the season with 17 points and 10 rebounds at home against Oregon State on Thursday. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
After jumping out to an 11-6 lead in the first half, Oregon State’s (9-14, 4-8) offense sputtered, failing to score for seven minutes until senior guard Lathen Wallace made two free throws after junior guard Jio Fontan fouled him.
In USC’s game against Oregon State last month, even a prolific 49-point second half was not enough to overcome a 10-point deficit at halftime. Thursday night, however, the Trojans did not allow a slow start to snowball and lead to an insurmountable first-half deficit.
All told, USC (13-11, 5-6) scored 16 points off 11 Oregon State turnovers in the first half, and headed to the locker room at halftime with a 14-point cushion, 37-23.
Early in the second half, Oregon State rattled off an 11-1 run before senior guard Donte Smith finally found his shooting stroke. In jeopardy of squandering a once imposing lead, the invaluable sixth man did not hesitate in drilling consecutive three-pointers, despite only having shot 1-8 up until that point. The Trojans proceeded to cruise until the final whistle blew.
Throughout the game, Oregon State’s offense struggled to adjust to a USC defensive scheme which stressed sagging within the three-point line and forcing the Beavers to make perimeter shots.
USC’s defense admirably contained Oregon State’s most dangerous scoring threat, sophomore guard Jared Cunningham, to 11 points on a miserable 1-6 shooting effort.
Lacking confidence in their poor shooting game, the Beavers often tried to penetrate the paint only to collide with the Trojans’ two immovable behemoths, junior forward Nikola Vucevic and senior forward Alex Stepheson.
Next on the docket for the Trojans in their quest to escape the bottom tier of the Pac-10 is a 7:30 p.m. game against Oregon at the Galen Center tomorrow.

In preparation for its final dual meet of the season, the No. 6 USC women’s swimming and diving team is gearing to face off against crosstown rival No. 21 UCLA on Saturday at 1 p.m at McDonalds Swim Stadium.
After frustrating losses at California and Stanford two weeks ago, the Women of Troy (8-2, 3-2) hope that this meet, also their senior meet, turns out to be a victory.
USC coach Dave Salo knows that hanging in the balance is not just one win against UCLA, but a long tradition of beating the Bruins.
“They are our traditional crosstown rivals and at stake is the gauntlet,” Salo said. “We’ve beat them three times in a row now and we are hoping to make it four times in a row.”
The winner of tomorrow’s dual meet is awarded five points that go towards the Crosstown Guantlet, which is a trophy awarded annually to the school that has the most successful athletic year compared to the other. Points awarded are based on the winner of each Trojan-Bruin head-to-head contest, and currently the Trojans are ahead 37.5-20.
Senior and co-captain Presley Bard is confident in USC’s chances of beating its biggest rival.
“There’s gonna be a couple of close races but we should be able to win almost every event,” Bard said. “It’s all in good fun but you always wanna beat your crosstown rivalry school.”
Looking back at the women’s swim team’s previous two dual meets, however, raises some questions about how confident the Women of Troy are feeling about tomorrow’s meet. After they fell to Cal 182-118, and at Stanford, 161.5-136.5, the team had a disappointing last couple of competitions.
Despite the losses, Bard is confident that team can move on and use the lessons learned from the Cal and Stanford meets this weekend.
“We definitely don’t want what happened at Cal and Stanford to happen again. Every day Dave has been reminding us about our losses as motivation, not because he is upset with us,” Bard said. “Sometimes we have to learn how to lose to learn how to win. He is hoping that we take the value of the lesson and take that energy and use it to move forward.”
With those inspirational thoughts in their mind, the Women of Troy are hoping for a successful, well-attended dual meet tomorrow not only for the sake of the Gauntlet, but for their seniors.
“I am hoping that a lot of people come out and support us,” Bard said. “We are not gonna be taking UCLA lightly. It’s gonna be a memorable and exciting day, and it’s always a really special meet because it’s the senior meet too.”

The USC men’s tennis team welcomes No. 20 Pepperdine at 1:30 p.m. today, hoping to extend its early-season winning streak to seven matches.
The Waves are also coming off an equally successful start at 5-1.
“They will have a lot of passion on the court,” said USC coach Peter Smith, who coached the Waves for six seasons. “They will bring energy, they’re great to play against and they are the most enthusiastic team we play.”
Though the Trojans (6-0) have enjoyed early season success, they know they still have work to do, and that the season is far from over.
“Being mentally stable makes it possible to win matches,” said junior Daniel Nguyen. “How you approach the match, whether you stay calm and don’t get too frustrated is crucial.”
Following last week’s match against University of San Diego — by far its most intense of the season — USC looks to stay grounded and focused on the task at hand.
“[Pepperdine] is always a good team. They’ve got a solid lineup from top to bottom,” Johnson said.
Coming off of consecutive 7-0 victories against Loyola Marymount and Santa Clara last week, Pepperdine will be ready to play.
Among their lineup are three nationally ranked players in No. 14 Sebastian Fanselow, No. 40 Alex Llompart and No. 112 Finn Tearney.
Tearney partners with the Waves’ Hugh Clarke, and they are ranked No. 35 nationally as well.
“They’re a national championship team which national championship coaches. They know what it takes,” Smith said.
Though Smith is confident that the Trojans will control the match, both he and Johnson acknowledge that at this point in the season, it is still a growing process.
“We’re getting better with each match. We’re a younger team and with more experience we improve,” Johnson said. “We need to keep things going [against Pepperdine].”
The Trojans will travel next week to the ITA National Team Indoor Championships, but for Johnson, Nguyen and the team, right now the focus is on facing the Waves.
“We’ve got to jump on them quickly, set the tone early on and don’t let go,” Johnson said.

USC coach Kevin O’Neill is very adamant that the Trojans’ identity is its defense, and that it needs to stop its opponents in order to have a chance to win.
The Trojans (13-11, 5-6) deviated from their defensive-minded strategy in their first game against Oregon State, allowing the Beavers (9-14, 4-8) to score 80 points in a loss in January.
“That was a stretch of the season where we relied too much on help [defense], and on [junior forward Nikola Vucevic] to change shots,” said junior guard Jio Fontan.
Trojan played hard against the Beavers and it paid off.
On Thursday, the Trojans displayed a renewed defensive toughness, defeating the Beavers 67-56 at the Galen Center.
It was the first win in four attempts for O’Neill against Oregon State.
“We played really good half-court defense,” O’Neill said. “We made some great hustle plays to get back in transition.”
After trailing 11-6, the Trojans held the Beavers scoreless for more than seven minutes, going on a 12-0 run behind four points from senior forward Alex Stepheson.
USC later went on a 9-0 run to extend their lead, and went into halftime leading 37-23.
Oregon State cut USC’s lead to as little as five points in the second half, but the Trojans kept their defensive intensity, limiting the Beavers to 56 points, which was only one more than their season low.
“We played more aggressively and smarter on defense,” Vucevic said.
The Beavers are also renowned for their defense. They employ a 1-3-1 zone defense that is notorious for causing opposing teams to commit many turnovers.
Oregon State came into the game leading the nation in steals, averaging 10.14 per game, and having committed less turnovers than their opponents in 14 of 22 games.
The 1-3-1 zone defense did little to frustrate the Trojans though.
The Beavers had nine steals, compared to five for USC, but the Trojans did a better job capitalizing on Oregon State’s mistakes, converting 28 points off turnovers, which was 18 more than the Beavers scored.
The Trojans had 14 turnovers, compared to 19 for Oregon State.
The Trojans were led by Vucevic, who had 17 points and 10 rebounds.
Stepheson had nine points and nine rebounds, and senior guard Donte Smith contributed 13 points off the bench.
Freshman guard Maurice Jones fouled out with eight points and a game-high six assists.
Oregon State had a balanced attack, with 10 players scoring at least two points, and no Beaver scoring more than 11 points.
The Trojans next host Oregon on Saturday at 7:30 p.m.
Coming into their Los Angeles road trip, the Ducks have won four of their last five Pac-10 Conference games, including their last two.
Ducks’ senior forward Joevan Catron is the reigning Pac-10 Men’s Basketball Player of the Week after helping the Ducks sweep Washington State and then-No. 20 Washington last weekend.
In those two games, Catron averaged 18.5 points, 9.0 rebounds, and 2.5 assists.
USC fell at Oregon on Jan. 13, 68-62. In that game, which was the opening night of Matthew Knight Arena, the Ducks led by as many as 20 points in the second half.
Catron did not play because of an injury in the first match-up between the two teams.

The Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles hosted an open community forum Thursday about the Figueroa Corridor Streetscape Project, a $30 million planned renovation funded by the California Department of Housing and Community Development Proposition 1C.
Lanes · Oliver Schulze, a director and architect with Gehl Architects, said a main goal of the initiative is to design more bicycle lanes along Figueroa. - Niranjan Madhavan | Daily Trojan 
The project will cover three miles of Figueroa Street, from Martin Luther King Boulevard in Exposition Park to 7th Street in Downtown, as well as half-mile sections of Martin Luther King Boulevard, Bill Robertson Lane and 11th Street.
Members of the project have been doing research and drafting designs since June, and have until the end of 2013 to use the money provided by the Proposition 1C grant, according to Scott Baker, a landscape architect with Meléndrez.
Thursday’s forum, held at the Expo Center, gave the architects of the project a change to present their plans.
According to Oliver Schulze, a director and architect with Gehl Architects, one of the project’s main focuses is creating a Figueroa Corridor that is friendlier to pedestrians, bicyclists and other alternative modes of transportation.
Steve Yang, a sophomore majoring in economics, said he thinks the renovations might cause more traffic on Figueroa.
“Cutting down on car traffic could create more traffic in other places,” Yang said. “But I would like to be able to walk down a better Figueroa.
On the current Figueroa Street, up to 80 percent of the right-of-way area is dominated by vehicles. Schulze and the rest of the Figueroa Corridor Streetscape Project hope to create a street with more balance, especially in pedestrian-heavy areas like those around USC and L.A. Live.
“We know that not far from here there are already thousands of bikes on the USC campus,” Schulze said. “There is a real potential here to actually create one of the major cycling commuter areas in the city. If this is a commuter artery, it should be so for cyclists too.”
The architectures of the project plans to reach this goal by creating more sheltered bicycle lanes along Figueroa Street that will allow for more efficient bicycle traffic. The bicycle lanes would be separated from vehicle traffic by a buffer zone that could be used for mass transit buses or parking cars.
In addition to renovations aimed toward balancing types of traffic on Figueroa Street, the project also hopes to make major changes to public spaces like those around Exposition Park. Bill Robertson Lane, which runs down the west side of the park, is a focus of the project.
“In the future we think that all of Bill Robertson Lane should change,” Schulze said. “We would like to redesign it so that it’s not something you drive through from point A to point B like a highway.”
Schulze outlined plans to create a more park-like atmosphere around Bill Robertson Lane, including a reduction of traffic to one lane and an increase in trees, green space, places to sit and more public space.
The project also aims to take a similar approach to Martin Luther King Boulevard. Plans for the road include creating a “linear park” that has shade structures, vending kiosks, a public running track and more access points into Exposition Park itself.
“The solution for MLK Boulevard is not just beautification,” Schulze said. “It should be reconfigured, removing the fence and remodeling in a different way so that people can start colonizing these places.
Students feel the renovations will be positive for the USC community.
“Work needs to be done on Figueroa to revitalize the area and make it feel more like a community,” said Matthew Redhead, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law.
The forum brought together members of the project including designers, architects and consultants from firms like Gehl Architects, Meléndrez and Troller Mayer Associates with residents and stakeholders of the communities surrounding the Figueroa Corridor.
“We want to hear from the communities that live, work and play here along the street,” said Deborah Murphy, a consulting senior associate at Meléndrez. “This project is all about improving the public realm.”

USC is in the process of implementing an Iranian Studies Initiative that will begin by offering Persian language courses in Fall 2011, continuing its quest to be a more global university.
Because Los Angeles is home to one of the largest Iranian populations outside of Iran, USC is expanding its curriculum to accommodate changes in student demand and the broader global environment, according to Bita Milanian, the executive director of the Farhang Foundation, the Iranian-American heritage foundation of Southern California that approached USC about creating this program.
USC will soon offer more classes focused on Iranian Studies and students say they look forward to them. 
The Iranian Studies Initiative will include three phases. The first phase is introducing Persian Language courses, which will begin next fall.
The second will include a minor in Iranian Studies and the third will entail adding a major. According to Milanian, the second and third phase of the initiative will be completed depending on when they receive funds from donors.
By adding Persian language classes, followed by a major and minor in Iranian Studies, both the university and the Farhang Foundation hope to create a more globally-aware student body.
“As the Iranian community of Southern California region grows, it becomes that much more necessary to offer educational opportunities in the areas of Persian language and Iranian Studies,” Milanian said.
The curriculum for the major and minor in Iranian studies is currently in development under the guidance of Kevin Van Bladel, a professor of classics and Middle East studies, and Bruce Zuckerman, director of the Religion department.
Van Bladel currently teaches courses on ancient and medieval Iran and has found students are actively asking for more of these courses. Zuckerman specializes in documenting and distributing Arabic texts.
“These new [language] courses will provide a deeper specialization and expertise with respect to one of the world’s most ancient and important cultures, in a way that illuminates contemporary issues of great global importance,” said Howard Gillman, dean of the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences.
The Iranian Studies initiative at USC is not the first of its kind in the area, as Iranian Studies programs at UCLA and UCSB are already in full swing. UCLA began its Iranian Studies programs almost 20 years ago while UCSB recently acquired its own program within the last five years.
“The existence of these centers and their very active programs suggest that there is a demand for Iranian Studies in this region,” Milanian said.
Through the Persian language classes and the eventual addition of a minor and major, USC is moving toward better representing the Iranian culture among the university’s community, according to Milanian.
“With such an overwhelming presence, the lack of Persian language classes and any Iranian Studies program at the university seemed unjustifiable,” Milanian said. “As the Iranian community of Southern California region grows, it becomes that much more necessary to offer educational opportunities in the areas of Persian language and Iranian Studies.”
Hoda Assadian, a graduate student studying industrial engineering and officer for the Iranian Graduate Students Association, is enthusiastic about the new program.
“We have a big community here in L.A. and we have a lot of second generation kids who are really not aware of the culture,” Assadian wrote in an e-mail. “Not only is the initiative seen as a way to inform, but also as a way to unite those who are Iranian or interested in the rich 3,000 year old culture.”
The IGSA has played a large part in raising awareness about the new program by reaching out to both Iranian and non-Iranian students.
Assadian said a program like USC’s is important in trying to fight the misconceptions about Iran.
“The Iran we see now is not a true picture of what we are, having these studies will help tell what the Iranian culture is really about,” Assadian said.
Kassie Simmons, an undeclared freshman, said she would definitely take advantage of Persian language courses that will be offered next fall.
“Learning the basics of Iranian culture starting from the language can satisfy my interest in the foreign aspects of the world, especially the Middle East,” Simmons said.
“USC to Offer New Iranian Study Classes.”
Why?
JLH
I’m all for adding Persian language classes and even a minor, but what employer is going to take an Iranian Studies major seriously? USC needs to cut funding from the bullshit majors that tarnish its academic reputation, and instead focus on strengthening truly academic majors.
Follow the readings, go to class and discuss with TA/prof, and write paper. What pragmatism, or science, is there to these kinds of “academic endeavors?” These bullsh’t majors are called “identity politics.” The students who waste their time with this stuff are the ones who “follow their dreams” via supporting movements like the Dream Act, no pun intended. It’s not really wasting time to them, because instead, they rationalize about how the world needs people with “soft skills.” 
Too scurred to take math and science courses at the collegiate level huh? especially when the curves are cutthroat. and like 90% of premed people drop out and hightail it to these kinds of majors.
My sub-3.0 as an ME, here @ Viterbi, may not sound impressive, but it sure as hell beats a 4.0 in this frivolous “pursue your dream” stuff. I got a J-O-B too, at an aerospace firm near LAX.

The university announced Thursday that Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer will be the commencement speaker for graduation this year.
Though some USC students do not know of Ballmer, many are excited to hear what he has to say.
“I know absolutely nothing about him, so my initial reaction is ambivalence,” said Eliza Hunt, a senior majoring in communication. “However, as CEO of such a prominent corporation he’s bound to have some insightful advice to share with a class of students who are entering the workforce at such a turbulent time.”
Microsoft CEO Steve A. Ballmer will speak at the USC 2011 commencement.
Abigail Hardin, a senior majoring in psychology and public relations, said she thinks Ballmer might not have been the best choice for a keynote speaker for graduation.
“I don’t really understand why a company CEO would necessarily be an inspiring speaker,” Hardin said. “He seems like a good guest lecturer for a class, but not for graduation.”
During commencement, USC will also award Ballmer an honorary degree.
Previous renowned commencement speakers included former university President Steven B. Sample in 2010; former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2009; Walt Disney CEO Robert Iger in 2008; and astronaut Neil Armstrong in 2005.
The graduation ceremony will consist of one main ceremony for all degree candidates and their families. Additionally, there will be smaller ceremonies for individual colleges and programs throughout the day.
Ballmer was born in 1956 and grew up near Detroit. Ballmer earned a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and economics from Harvard University.
During Ballmer’s undergraduate years at Harvard, where he lived down the hall from Bill Gates, he managed the football team and worked on the Harvard Crimson newspaper and university literary magazine.
Ballmer with Bill Gates, who he has known since college.
After graduation, Ballmer worked at Procter & Gamble Co. for two years as an assistant product manager.
He joined Microsoft in 1980 after attending Stanford Graduate School of Business.
Though some USC students said they are looking forward to hearing Ballmer’s commencement speech, graduation itself is more exciting for some students.
“I can’t wait to graduate. It’s going to be an exciting time in my life, and I look forward to the future,” said Tarek Chamma, a graduate student studying global communication. “But I don’t know who he is.”
Commencement will take place on Friday, May 13, and an estimated 40,000 guests are expected to attend as 5,000 students receive their degrees, according to the USC Office of Protocol and University Events.
The commencement speaker reflects the milieu of the university. No need to delve into this, or question how this person’s social stature is relevant. Just accept things at face value, live in the moment, and be happy. No need for the disenchantment. 
@Anon, even if your statement is true, why burst the bubble for others?
Ballmer’s son goes to USC currently. Coincidence?
Hardin, you’re stupid. Steve B has been more successful than you could ever hope or imagine to be. Go back to your Comm homework.
Anonymous– you took the words right out of my mouth. whoever the eff this girl is she shows how dumb the comm majors are on the whole. hope you enjoy post-grad life as a housewife. bet you wished you majored in business.
I hope he gives as “enthusiastic” of a graduation speech as his other normal speeches.
I don’t really understand why a company CEO giving speech at graduation.
Then who do you want? Justin Bieber…
abigail hardin sounds like a complete idiot

As students walked near the south side of the Tutor Campus Center, many were concerned that there was a gas leak in the area because of the stong odor. However, after DPS and Hazmat teams investigated the area, they found that there was a research experiment being conducted in Stabler Hall that produced a gas-like smell and that there was no threat of a gas leak.
Smells of gas in the USC area caused students to become concern Thursday.

On Wednesday night, a group of students settled down for a night of rhythm and rhymes as USG’s Program Board hosted a program entitled “Poetry Slam” at Ground Zero.
Speak up · Wednesday night, Ground Zero hosted a poetry showcase with Javon Johnson, along with other student performers such as Caspar Brun, a freshman majoring in theatre. The poets touched on life themes. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
The event featured performances from six students performers as well as special guest Javon Johnson.
As the headliner of the event, spoken word artist Johnson was a name and face familiar to several members of the audience.
He is a teaching fellow at USC in the department of American Studies and Ethnicity and has performed at freshman orientations on campus in years past.
Despite the fact that Johnson concluded the night, he was the one who managed to get the most noise from the crowd by peppering his performance with anecdotes about his dating history and dishing out some relationship advice.
With Valentine’s Day just around the corner, all of Johnson’s poems centered around love.
One of his poems told the story of a relationship just starting out, punctuated with Johnson’s signature, humorous lines.
“I told you the story of the homeless man who tried to squirt me with a water gun. He followed me for almost half a block,” he said in one of his poems.
His most amusing poem, however, was titled “10 Reasons Why Women Are Like Religion,” where he weaved together sentimentality and comedy, giving reasons like: “Both of them assume a portion of my income belongs to them,” and “Both want to tell me the most important shit during Sunday morning football.”
The six student performers who preceded Johnson each brought something different to the table.
Marc Payne, a senior majoring in communication and the first performer of the night, opened his set with a poem titled “Irrelevant Flaws,” which merged the description of an idealized woman with constant references to the commodities of modern life.
Payne’s most interesting poem was his last, entitled “Circle of Sex.”
The poem started with a casual and light tone about sex: “I had sex with Britney, who had sex with Kenny, who had sex with Jenny, who had sex with Keith.”
As the circle continues, the poem unravels to reveal dark humor, the realities of unprotected sex and fears of being HIV positive, making the poem gripping and haunting.
Lauren Dawson, a junior majoring in international relations and neuroscience, took to the stage and performed a powerful rendition of her poem, “The Letter H” which included a myriad of words beginning with the letter H from hopelessness to homosexuals, honor and hell.
Dawson’s other poems, “Miracle Grow” and “Stop” spoke of the pains of growing up and saying good-bye, as well as the acidic hatred one person can feel toward another.
Nate Howard, a sophomore majoring in communications and a member of the Beat Advocate, a hip-hop group, entertained the audience with his loud, intense rhythm and barely paused to breathe during his performance.
A crowd favorite was the narrative he spun about talking to a girl with bad breath, which unfurled into a metaphor about the dismal conversational skills of some women.
Other notable performances of the night included one by Jade Fields, a junior majoring in psychology, who passionately delivered “Thursdays,” which spoke about her encounters with a “homeless philosopher” on a bus.
Caspar Brun, a freshman majoring in theatre, recited a poem about how poetry was not dead and pointed out that within the walls of Ground Zero, it was certainly still alive and well.
Brendan Troy, a junior majoring in international relations was the only person that night to actually sing a poem during his allotted time.
The natural melody of the poem seemed to resonate with the audience as it watched Troy croon lyrics onstage.
If you missed Wednesday’s poetry slam, there will be another opportunity to get your fill as Visions and Voices, together with Javon Johnson, will host the event “Words in Your Face” on March 3 at Bovard Auditorium.
Just a clarification on Lauren’s poetry…her poem “The Letter H” is about the reasons she hates the letter “H”. It talks about things like hate, abuse, homophobia, sexual violence, exploitation, hunger/homelessness, etc.
Her poem “Miracle Grow” is actually about having to face mortality with her best friend…not really about growing up. And “Stop” is about sexual violence/abuse…it really isn’t about hate at all, but about dealing with the ramifications of things like abuse. Just wanted to clarify that…

If there was ever anyone qualified to be considered an authority on the geek world ascension in pop culture, it would be Chris Hardwick.
After all, the man founded and hosts the Nerdist podcast, which discusses all manners of geek and nerd culture, from comic books to technology.
Geek culture has been increasingly prominent in mainstream life, as a fascination and love of technology has risen, alongside focus on interactive media, science-fiction and fantasy and a re-emergence of the comic book medium.
Being Geeky and into technology appears to be the "cool" thing today. 
Hardwick has been a nerd for most of his life, and has seen the aspects of geek culture go from sidelined to integral to mainstream life.
“Even the most non-nerd humans have smart phones and laptops, desktops, DVRs and Xboxes. Our culture’s ruled by technology,” Hardwick said. “The nerds won. The highest grossing films are nerd-themed movies. If you take a look, you’ll see that video games for the most part outgrow movies. That’s all nerd culture.”
And Hardwick should know, as he’s lived through the rise of the geek. He grew up just before the big breakthrough in geek culture, when blockbusters didn’t involve superheroes, cell phones were bigger than bricks and most people did not know what the Internet was.
“[My interest in geek stuff] goes back to being a kid and having a grandfather who was a technophile and had all sorts of gadgets. Most people didn’t have those things when I was kid,” Hardwick said. “There wasn’t much you could do with computers in the ’80s, it wasn’t super consumer-friendly just yet. And I was in the chess club, Latin club, computer club and I played D & D.”
This led him to start the Nerdist podcast, a weekly show focused on the ever expanding world of geeky topics.
“I just thought, ‘I’m going to do a blog, I want it to be about an idea that’s bigger than me, I want it to be something that people can relate to,’” Hardwick said. “Looking at my life and the things I’m interested in, it was just pulling those together. It all tended to revolve around nerd culture.”
Since then, Hardwick, who also works as a stand-up comedian and actor, has been a fixture on shows like “The Late Late Show” with Craig Ferguson. He is often being called up to offer his analysis on new superhero movies or the growing popularity of Doctor Who in the United States.
This has given him the chance to introduce a wider audience to the ever-growing world of nerds and geeks. But despite his growing amount of listeners, Hardwick said one thing hasn’t changed: the media’s perception of geeks.
“Not all nerds have the horn-rimmed glasses and slide protectors,” Hardwick said. “That’s just become the representational image because the reality is nerd culture is so pervasive now it’s difficult to put into words what it is.”
The subculture did have an archetypal frame, and that’s what has arguably stuck in the collective conscience, no matter how things have changed and evolved.
“The classic nerds are the ones that love sci-fi, tech and hyper-analytical thought,” Hardwick said. “I don’t know why the media still shorthands us. In a way though, it’s kind of fun.”
The behavioral tropes of a nerd or geek, Hardwick said, are not exclusive to that subculture, but rather extend to all walks of life. They apply to the rise in hyper-focused interests over the last decade, where people become very passionate about one topic, becoming quasi-experts on it.
“Most people nerd out about something,” Hardwick said. “A nerd or geek will get very, very into a world and claim it, and because of this, the reason nerds are so powerful is because they have an almost limited ability to focus on things.”
It’s that rise in hyper-focus that Hardwick doesn’t imagine will change. If anything, he says, geek culture will become even more integrated into mainstream life, even as cultural fads come and go.
“Unless there’s an apocalypse, technology won’t go backwards. It’s becoming more and more a part of people’s lives every day,” he said. “The fact that 3G and 4G is part of our social vernacular is pretty telling right there. Will everyone know there’s a bunch of different Green Lanterns? Maybe, but they’ll know there is a Green Lantern.”
Hardwick sees his fellow nerds as leaders in new mainstream trends, but certainly not followers.
“It’s just the nerd’s job to stay ahead of the curve,” he said.
Nicholas Slayton is a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism. His column, “Age of the Geek,” runs Fridays. 
This Hardwick guy’s like a rockstar. I guess the “age of the geek” has something to do with how our society is finally offering fair attribution to those  who are truly making things happen by pushing buttons in some cave somewhere. Yet, Justin Bieber is still at the top of the charts and making big money, so who knows. A synergy of all human culture strewn through new media networks awaits. It’s kinda fun to be participating in it, isn’t it?

Many singles dread Valentine’s Day. Many consider it a sadistic, Hallmark holiday, meant to inflict stress on those who need to find a date.
But Valentine’s Day is only a painful reminder of one’s relationship status if you let it be.
So for those who are dreading Valentine’s Day weekend here are some exciting alternatives to take your mind off it.
Buh-bye Jack and Rose, hello scary movie marathon.
Instead of watching the tragically beautiful Titanic for the 100th time, why not have a fright fest?
There’s no better way to distract yourself from relationship woes than to engage in something completely unromantic.
Pick up a classic like The Shining or Psycho and embrace the true brilliance of thrillers at their peak.
Love should always be in the air for Valentine's Day!
Ladies, head to West Hollywood and make an event out of it
For ladies looking for a break from slimy players, clubs like Rage and Micky’s allot plenty of hands-off dancing surrounded by a diverse group of gay men looking to have a good time. Not to mention, Millions of Milkshakes is right across the street, and everyone knows that a chocolate hot fudge milkshake is the best cure for a lonely heart.
Play the part of the overly obnoxious couple in love
Grab your best friend and be thespians for the night. Embrace your characters to the fullest. Get lost in each other’s puppy dog eyes, call each other ‘pookie’ and serenade each other in love songs and romantic poetry.
You’ll be so wrapped up in playing the part that you won’t even think about your true relationship status. If you’re lucky, maybe that best friend will turn into something more.
Baby-sit and cash in
Although this isn’t the most exciting event, if you don’t have other plans you might as well.
Plus, when your true sweetheart comes along, you’ll now have the cash to shower that person in gifts — even if it doesn’t happen to be Feb. 14.
Pamper yourself because you’re worth it
Everyone deserves to feel like royalty once in a while.
When you forget about all the midterms, papers, work, drama and everything else that piles up and treat yourself to something nice, you’ll feel better and more confident. A mani-pedi can serve as a fantastic ego-boost.
Do something charitable: help the world, help yourself
What matters most to you? Is it environmental conservation, education, health conditions or human rights? Whatever it might be, find a way to get involved and help out. Doing things for others makes you feel better and, ultimately, the most important relationship you have is the one with yourself.
Go to a party and rage
If you’re craving some form of intimacy, plenty of singles are in the same boat.
Now is just as good a time as any to put yourself out there — you never know who you’ll come across.
At the very least you can have a fun night out with your friends and listen to some quality dubstep.
Get a group of friends and write down all the reasons why you love each other
Valentine’s Day is indeed about love, but nothing says it can’t be between friends.
They’re the ones who will always be there for you, so why not express your gratitude and make a list of all the reasons why those people mean the world to you?
Love comes in many shapes and sizes, and sometimes friendship is the best form to be celebrating.
Sweat it out, Richard Simmons style
Whether you’re frustrated about a recent breakup or simply can’t beat the blues, working out is a great way to re-energize and seize the day. Exercise releases endorphins, endorphins make you happy and happy people just don’t feel bad on Valentine’s Day.
If you aren’t feeling up to celebrating, try jogging or doing a bit of yoga to put yourself in a better mental state.

For many, “V-Day” is simply an abbreviation for a holiday overflowing with flowers, greeting cards and little heart-shaped candies. For the women of A Window Between Worlds, however, V-Day means so much more.

For the eighth year in a row, V-Day USC, an extension of the global movement to end abuse against women and children, will donate the proceeds from its annual production of The Vagina Monologues to A Window Between Worlds, a nonprofit organization that helps domestic violence survivors use art as a healing tool.
“The whole performance is about finding the safety to speak honestly about our bodies and about our stories in such an empowering way,” said Cathy Salser, founder and executive director of A Window Between Worlds. “And V-Day is an international movement that is transforming the world.”
The famed series of monologues was written by playwright and activist Eve Ensler after she conducted dozens of interviews with women about sexuality, rape and abuse.
When Ensler realized that performances of her play could be a catalyst in the movement to end violence against women and girls, she and a group of women established V-Day. They kicked off the movement in 1998 with a Valentine’s Day benefit performance in New York City.
“It was so heartbreaking for Eve to hear about the violence and the trauma that she felt like she needed to do something with this,” Salser said. “So she made it into a campaign so that students all over the world could take her play and bring it to life to end violence in their communities.”
Today, USC’s production of The Vagina Monologues is one of more than 5,400 V-Day events held all over the world to benefit local projects and programs each year. Since V-Day USC first gave its proceeds to A Window Between Worlds in 2004, the number of women that the organization is able to serve has nearly quadrupled.
“In 2004, we were serving 6,400 women,” Salser said. “Now it’s 25,000 per year.”
A Window Between Worlds, based in Venice, Calif., brings weekly art workshops to more than 100 domestic violence shelters in 23 states. The funds raised by V-Day USC go toward providing training and art supplies to help start new programs.

Audrey Salzburg, associate director of A Window Between Worlds, said the organization’s programs give women and children who have experienced abuse a voice they didn’t think they had.
“Typically we talk about the survivors as victims — their voices have been silenced because it’s not something you talk about,” Salzburg said. “What we do is give them the safety, the freedom and the space they need to explore and find their voice.”
According to Salser, a new art project is added to the organization’s curriculum each month. The art projects include things like the Funeral of I Cant’s and the Personal Needs Flower. Projects such as these allow survivors to look at where they were, where they are now and where they want to be, Salser said.
“I think Art doesn’t require words and sometimes words aren’t enough to have,” Salzburg said. “The art itself allows them to find an expression that taps into the heart. It meets you wherever you are in your growth and your healing.”
The women and children who participate in A Window Between Worlds’ programs also get to share their artwork with the public, both in the exhibit section of the organization’s website, www.awbw.org, as well as at live exhibitions. Artwork by 800 survivors and community members will be on display at the Korean Cultural Center starting March 5, the organization’s largest exhibit ever. Some of the survivors’ artwork might also be on display at V-Day USC’s performance of The Vagina Monologues, Salser said.
Salzburg, who has seen The Vagina Monologues performed in many different settings and by many different people, said that there is something special about USC’s production.
“I’ve seen it in New York on Broadway, where the cast was on stools and talking to the audience, which is wonderful and very effective, but I have to say the USC performance is enthralling,” she said. “It really speaks to the heart of what Eve was getting at when she wrote it.”
V-Day USC is the first of a number of organizations that holds fundraising events in which A Window Between Worlds will be participating in this year to celebrate the organization’s 20th anniversary. Both Salser and Salzburg said they are very grateful to USC and they cherish the opportunity that V-Day USC provides to spread awareness about the need to end abuse against women and children.
“You don’t have to be a survivor to end violence in the domestic community,” Salser said. “It really takes all of us.”
V-Day USC will present The Vagina Monologues on Friday and Saturday at the Village Gate Theatre.
Thanks so much for writing such a beautiful article about the work we do here at AWBW.  As an employee I am not only proud, but thrilled with the support we receive from the young women at USC.  To date they have made so much possible for the people we serve.  Thanks USC Vday 2011 Cast and Crew.

To effectively grasp what the government actually does with its power, the most important thing to understand is the federal budget.
That is why graphic designer Jess Bachman’s new poster, “Death and Taxes: 2011,” is such a useful tool for educators, activists and curious citizens alike.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
With it, Bachman gives a dramatic, to-scale, graphical representation of President Obama’s proposed 2011 budget, focusing especially on the discretionary budget (the part that changes yearly and does not include Social Security, Medicare or other entitlements). Bachman’s poster breaks the budget down into all programs that receive more than $200 million and shows how budget priorities have changed during the past decade.
“Death and Taxes” is striking because it reveals the appalling nature of our national priorities and the vast overreach of the federal government.
Some gems from the 2011 budget:
The government plans to spend $3.834 trillion, although it expects to take in only $2.567 trillion — that’s a deficit of $1.267 trillion. That means the federal government alone will be taking on about $4,000 of debt per U.S. citizen in a single year.
Of that, $1.415 trillion is discretionary, while the rest consists of Social Security, unemployment insurance and other types of income security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on our existing debt and veterans’ benefits.
Perhaps most shocking is how the discretionary spending is apportioned: 63 percent of it, a whopping $895 billion, is classified as military or security spending. $713 billion of that goes to the Department of Defense, up 91 percent from 2001.
In 2011, we will spend $985 million on bullets, $3.934 billion on F-35 Lightning II fighter jets, $6.804 billion on federal prisons and $2.136 billion on international narcotics control.
In contrast, we will spend $1.818 billion on higher education and $8.513 billion on a whole range of programs under the heading “global health and child survival.”
There are innumerable lessons to be taken from the budget.
When bullets, prisons and the overseas drug war combine to represent a higher priority than global health and child survival, something is awry.
Not only is there a moral problem here, there is a practical one too. The long-term success of everything the United States claims to cherish — liberty, democracy, human rights, prosperity — depends largely on our ability to shift resources away from short-term solutions to today’s problems and toward investments in a better future.
We can, and must, fund departments like Homeland Security to counter immediate threats, but a strategic nation would devote equal attention to eliminating those threats in the long run by promoting our values in a positive manner.
The second lesson to be learned from Bachman’s poster is that we spend a ludicrous amount on defense. The United States already has the largest, most powerful and most advanced military in the world. So it is shocking to see that in 2009, we almost outspent the rest of it.
As it is, we represented 43 percent of international defense spending; second-place China spent only 6.6 percent.
When we spend so much time wondering why China has so much money to invest or lend to us, while we are chronically short on cash, maybe we should consider that China saves an extra $600 billion per year by shunning the ambition to be able to beat the rest of the world in some sort of apocalyptic fantasy war.
The final lesson in Bachman’s poster is how disingenuous today’s “deficit hawk” politicians really are. Republicans are haggling over whether they will cut spending by about $60 billion or $100 billion, a difference whose minimal value is put in clear perspective by Bachman’s graphics.
Seeing the numbers on a single page makes it obvious that closing the deficit will require a combination of major spending cuts with major tax increases.
With Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid costs set to rise exponentially over the coming years, the challenge will be even greater.
Until politicians are honest with the American people and admit the inevitability of both higher taxes and massive spending cuts, there is no way it will be possible to fix the deficit that threatens our economic future.
There is, however, reason for optimism. Our miserable job of prioritization has created opportunities for a more balanced budget.
Perhaps with more efforts like Bachman’s, Americans will become aware enough to hold politicians accountable for insincere promises and demand real, tangible change.

Long regarded as one of the most stable, prestigious and financially rewarding designations, a Juris Doctorate seems to be as popular as ever in the minds of prospective undergraduate students.
If nothing else, earning a law degree is seen as a safe and secure route. If three years of grueling postgraduate work and $200,000 or so of debt can’t guarantee a stable and rewarding career, what can? Even this superficial outlook seems convincing.
The problem to anyone paying any attention is that reality is just the opposite.
For years, studies and casual observations have highlighted a market over-saturated with lawyers, one in which basic laws of economics fall to the wayside, where supply grows even as demand shrinks. One study out of Northwestern Law showed 15,000 attorney and legal jobs have been cut from large firms around the country since 2008.
Add this indisputably clear trend to the fast-rising cost of attending law school, which, for the vast majority of students, is financed by student loans that can easily leave graduates with up to $200,000 in debt, and you can see the potential for disaster.
This begs the question: Given the current climate, why are students still lining up to go to law school, even at mediocre institutions?
As anyone seriously considering law school can tell you, the U.S. News & World Report annual rankings is the Holy Grail of law school stratification and the primary guide for potential applicants and legal employers alike.
Of course, applicants often consider a range of factors, such as cost and location, when looking into schools, but in terms of perceived quality and prestige, these rankings are most trusted.
The problem with these rankings is that they are derived from data that is collected and analyzed by the law schools individually, in a process which is neither perfectly standardized nor audited.
This has led to some very questionable data reporting, which can be described as creative accounting.
In one category, graduates known to be employed nine months after graduation, the criteria is so broad that a graduate waiting tables, selling shoes or doing any other job unrelated to the legal field would be counted as an employed person to boost the statistics.
Few would argue that choosing to attend a top-10  school over a lower-tiered school is a bad decision, but the distinction is seldom that clear.
For example, should the rankings be a fool-proof guide in choosing a school ranked in the 30s over one ranked in the 50s? What about when there is a significant difference in the cost of attendance?
We can only hope the American Bar Association and the Association for Legal Career Professionals, the organizations in charge of setting the guidelines for the surveys, will impose stricter standards and audit results in the future, or that U.S. News will unilaterally demand similar action.
Even better in terms of the larger issue of an over-abundance of lawyers would be strong restrictions on the number of law schools accredited by the profession itself, a tactic already perfected within the medical profession.
Until there is clear reform of some sort, it is up to students to understand the extent to which they can rely on the rankings, and at what point it fails to be a useful tool.

I have heard about this before but never quite understood what the problem was. now I understand, thank you very much.
USC Law – Top Tier #1!
Very informative article.  I have heard about the rankings and their problems before in passing but now I understand what all the fuss is really about.  Thank you!
I wouldn’t be so presumptuous about your “$150,000 average starting pay” assertion there, Marie. Law is really a hit-or-miss deal. You can come out of a prestigious law school such as an Ivy or anything “commensurate,” and it doesn’t mean you’ll make rockstar money off the bat. 
I interned for a big shot law firm a couple summers ago, in an affluent part of Los Angeles, which I won’t name. But coincidently, all the lawyers were either from Ivies, Georgetown, Duke or East Coast top-tiered schools. The parking lot was filled with current model Ferraris, Porsches, or anything European that costed at least $100,000.  These lawyers had more than 1 home in affluent communities. It was like MTV Cribs, no hyperbole. But you know what? these guys were some of the biggest alcoholic, coke (not cola) addicted, DUI-getting, divorcing, affair having, losing their homes to banks, miserable, getting sued themselves, mental health impaired group of people I’ve come across. These guys would come to work either hung over or coked out. (sorry if my post wasn’t PG-13 enough)
I’m not in law school nor pre-law. If law is your passion, and you’re sincere about practicing law ethically, then good for you; and if you become wealthy from it, that’s the icing on the cake. But narrowing your focus on law school rankings, the wealth that can be attained from it, etc. shouldn’t be your reason to pursue law. I mentioned earlier that it was hit or miss…and when you miss, you can be relegated to being a low paid public defender or some other “crusader lawyer” who makes peanuts.
Hey I think you’re right about the hit or miss, although I think at least a part of it is how hard you work. That’s the way I’ll approach it if I go into law. Like those alcoholic coworkers you talk about didn’t get anywhere eventually because they weren’t focussed on their job.
Anyways, while its true that you can hit or miss no matter what school you go to, the idea is that the better the school, the better your chances of hitting if you put in the same effort than if you went to a lesser school.  The problem I have with the rankings is that they aren’t being honest in saying which schools are better than others, which messes up people’s judgement.  So when I talked about the 150,000 average STARTING salary that a lowly school bragged about, I was just showing how when there’s obviously wrong stuff like that going on it definitely messes up the rankings overall.  Like there’s no way in the world thats the right number, its probably less than half of that.
No its actually really spot on…my friend is just starting law school and she was telling me about when she was applying to law school it was so hard to decide how to really value the schools.  They brag about a lot more than just employment data, like for one she told me that they give the average income of new grads and some pretty horrible schools were reporting $150,000 on average!  The school she goes to (which I won’t name) apparently doesn’t count its part time students towards the data and pulls tricks like that.  Its all pretty messed up when you think about it. 
I’m thinking about law school and the way I see it, the tiers seem accurate but within the tiers there’s no telling what you’re getting.
Law school rankings are a reliable source for something, but the question is what.  They are highly indicative of future job prospects, especially as you go down the tiers.  No one has ever said, and US News has never claimed, that they should be the only source, but they are a source that should be relied on.  Nearly a quarter of the rank is derived from academic prestige – something everyone should care about because employers certainly do.  Calling job numbers “creative accounting” is somewhat disingenuous since US News does not require only legal jobs to be reported.  What you should have focused on is that when schools do not report their employed at graduation numbers, US News simply reduces their employed at 9 months numbers to create a fictional number for employed at graduation.  This is the true creative accounting because it incentivizes not reporting certain data.  It has nothing to do with creatively reporting it and more to do with a system that rewards you for not reporting at all.
Before criticizing something as unreliable, you need to do some research on what goes into it as well has how it is used.

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak declared Thursday in the wake of increasing pressure that he had transferred all effective powers of the presidency to Vice President Omar Suleiman.  However, Mubarak maintained his previous position that he will not step down until his term officially ends in September.
Earlier reports had indicated that Mubarak would indeed be stepping down.  Crowds gathered in Cairo’s Tahrir Square anticipating a speech announcing Mubarak’s resignation, only to hear that Mubarak would be not be stepping down.  The crowd began to shout, “get out” and “leave” as the news spread throughout the Square.
Vice President Suleiman called on the youth of Egypt to go home and to “not listen to the satellite television stations whose main purpose is to fuel sedition and drive a wedge among the people.”  President Obama said early Thursday that the Untied States supports an “orderly and genuine transfer to democracy in Egypt.”

What would you do for an Oscar?
Melissa Leo, who is in contention for Best Supporting Actress for her role in The Fighter, is prepared to do just about anything.
The actress created immense controversy last week when she released several advertisements in major publications without the knowledge of the distributors who released the film. The advertisements feature her in a black sequin dress and simply read, “Consider…” This marks the first time an actor has taken out an advertisement for awards season for themselves.
“I took matters into my own hands. I knew what I was doing and told my representation how earnest I was about this idea. I had never heard of any actor taking out an ad as themselves and I wanted to give it a shot” Leo said.
The controversial move raises concerns about whether her actions will backfire and ultimately affect voter’s decisions, who have until Feb. 22 to cast their ballots. If so, it can potentially open doors and sway voters to chose 14-year-old Hailee Steinfeld, who is nominated for her performance in True Grit.
“This entire awards process to some degree is about pimping yourself out. I’m confident my fans will understand the ads were about showing a different side of myself,” Leo said.
Leo has come out a winner at nearly every major award show this season, including the Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild Awards and the Critics Choice Awards.
The only thing that’s left for her to win is the coveted Oscar.
In 2009, she was nominated for her performance in Frozen River. This year, she’s making sure she can go the distance.
Well, here’s to hoping she loses….  This is disgusting and is representative of how misguided she is.  Winning for the sake of winning in an awards ceremony?  Pathetic.

With Valentine’s Day coming soon, it’s easy to give into the fluffy, pink festivities. But what if you’re just not that into the traditional love story, don’t have that special someone or just would love to think about your one true love? Here’s a cinephile’s guide to Valentine’s Day Weekend 2011 in Los Angeles.
Harold and Maude screening
Thursday, 7:30 pm at Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood.
This 1971 hipster classic documents the strange relationship between a young man and a mature woman who find each other scintillating despite their statuses as outcasts. It’s strange, but iconic.
Never say Never 
In theaters Friday
Everyone’s favorite ubiquitous teen heartthrob is about to gain some major artistic street cred: the wide release of a 3D documentary. Scoff and roll your eyes if you wish, but the boy can sing and dance. The dewy-eyed pop star is the perfect projected companion for the single person in need of some loving, after all. And if Usher likes him, shouldn’t you? Besides, we all know that you definitely sing “Baby” in the shower.
The Notebook screening
Sunday, 8:00 pm at Arclight Pasadena.
Take a buddy, a loved one, or your own weeping self out and watch our generation’s cheesiest, most self-indulgent love story on the big screen. A little obvious, yes, but clichés aside, the film’s steamy, yet intimate love scene will heat up even the most frigid of viewers.
Netflix Marathon
If you’re not feeling like leaving your bed in fear of encountering a fighting, or openly flirtatious, couple, let Netflix be your companion. Our recommendations for streaming romances:
From Here to Eternity (1953)
Making out on a beach is easier to watch than to actually execute. This is the ultimate iconic beach makeout scene so observe and learn, kids.
A Room with a View (1986)
A timeless love story based on literature, this drama will have you wondering where romance has gone in modern times, and when Helena Bonham Carter became such an eccentric public figure.
Up (2006)
It may be a cartoon, but Up is no children’s movie. It’s the ultimate love story in which a man has to deal with losing his better half. It certainly helps that he’s got a floating house, an adorable chubby boy scouts and a fleet of talking dogs to make the journey a little more interesting.

Making his way through movies, television shows and even a performance for the United Nations, Los Angeles native Keaton Simons has slowly made his name in the local music scene.
The singer, songwriter and instrumentalist, garnered lots of radio airplay as well as television and movie placements since his first EP, which in turn led him to a record contract with CBS records.
Majoring in “Ethnomusicology” in college, Simons’ 2009 debut album “Can You Hear Me” showcases his distinct style. Although his music is categorized as blues, pop and rock, he combines the genres of rock, blues, jazz and bluegrass.
He often performs in local venues like the renowned Hotel Café and The Troubadour. His live shows are definitely a treat as his presence on stage captivates each member of the audience, from his unique dressing style to his upbeat sound.
My Top Picks: “Nobody Knows,” “Grim Reaper,” “Without Your Skin” and “Good Things Get Better.”
