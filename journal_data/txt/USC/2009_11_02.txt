After suffering their worst loss since 1997, the No. 12 Trojans took their first step toward turning the page Monday by trying to put the pieces back together on the practice field.
USC struggled on both sides of the ball during what was perhaps the most humiliating defeat of the Pete Carroll era, but the coach said he liked what he saw out of his players at Monday’s practice and expects his team to play strong throughout its remaining schedule.

“We had a very good first day of the week, better than the last couple Mondays for obvious reasons, but it was a very sharp day,” he said. “We’ll just do it one day at a time, and that’s how you rebuild the mentality.”
Once labeled USC’s strength, the Trojans’ defense appeared helpless Saturday. It surrendered 47 points and 613 total yards to the No. 8 Ducks in a game that many thought would be a tight battle. But Carroll said most of the blame falls on the coaches, not the players.
“The guys were mentally bottled up with the stuff we were doing,” Carroll said. “We tried to scheme in too much. So we made mistakes we normally wouldn’t make. We didn’t play the way we’d normally play. It was a disastrous outcome when they were able to run the ball like that.”
Carroll, who said he felt sick after watching tape of the 47-20 loss in Eugene, Ore., was referring to the 391 rushing yards the Trojans gave up on the ground. He said he originally liked the gameplan he and his coaches set up, and that it may have worked with last year’s veteran defense, but it didn’t hit right on Saturday.
The players, like Carroll, believe they need to stop thinking about Saturday and start looking forward. Redshirt sophomore middle linebacker Chris Galippo, who was one of many Trojans held out of practice Monday due to injury, said the defense needs to learn from its mistakes.
“We’re just going back to basics and taking it one step at a time,” Galippo said. “We’re not putting our heads in our laps, but keeping our heads up and just finishing the season out. You just never know what’s going to happen. Don’t count us out.”
Some critics have argued that the Pac-10 is one of the weaker conferences when compared to the SEC, Big 12 and Big Ten. But Carroll said the conference is strong from top to bottom this year with great quarterbacking and speedy defenses. He said USC will have a tough opponent every week from here on out.
“The comparisons will hopefully be made when it comes bowl time when everybody gets to play,” he said. “This conference — and I talked about it at the beginning of the year — is better than I thought it was going to be, and I thought it was going to be pretty strong anyway.”
The upcoming opponents might be even tougher for USC due to the injury bug that has plagued the team recently.
Galippo did not practice Monday because he suffered a neck injury Saturday. He had an MRI and X-rays, but said he feels fine and will be ready to practice Tuesday.
Junior running back Joe McKnight was also held out of practice due to a number of injuries, the biggest of which is his hurt ankle. But like Galippo, McKnight said he thinks he’ll be ready to go for Saturday’s game.
Redshirt junior Damian Williams also did not suit up yesterday because he is nursing a sore glute muscle that he re-aggravated against Oregon. He said he feels stronger than he did last week, but he is still sore.
Junior linebacker Malcolm Smith was originally diagnosed with a cracked shoulder after a collision in Saturday’s contest. Carroll said, however, that an MRI showed no crack, so the coach is not sure if or when Smith will return. Redshirt sophomore Shane Horton would start in his place.
Junior defensive end Everson Griffen also did not practice due to a sprained toe. Carroll said he will know more about the injury Tuesday night.
Junior wide receiver Ronald Johnson also did not appear at practice due to sickness.

It’s not you, it’s me.
All right, that’s not true — it is you. But breaking up is hard to do, and I’m new at this.
Passing the torch · Oregon’s Jordan Holmes lifts LaMichael James after a touchdown in a game that saw the Ducks dethrone USC. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
We’ve been inseparable for what seems like forever. Whenever somebody mentioned “Pac-10,” they couldn’t help but bring up “USC.” As a perennial champion, you gave meaning to me as a conference. We had a run that could only be paralleled by Florida State and the ACC in the ’90s.
But nothing gold can stay, and I think it’s time to call it quits.
Everyone said this would be the year it would end between us. They said you were different this year and that someone would finally knock you off your pedestal. But all your buddies on campus faithfully said Pete Carroll would find a way to repeat yet again.
But it’s become blatantly clear that you’ve changed this year. And Saturday proved that beyond a reasonable doubt.
Look, I was willing to stand by you after the loss to Washington. It seemed just like any other year of our rocky relationship. Everyone said it was a disappointment, but it was nothing we hadn’t all seen before. It seemed like it would be just like last year when Oregon State caught you off guard, but you bounced back to finish the season in style.
At worst, it appeared that we were destined for another memorable New Year’s Day date at the Rose Bowl. I know the students had grown tired of them, but I’m sure they all lust for those days now.
However, these last few weeks showed us something was still wrong. And after what happened with Oregon, well, I just don’t know where we stand.
What happened on Halloween in Eugene was surreal and still hard to compute. The 27-point margin of defeat from that loss was one point more than the combined margin of all of your losses since 2004. For all of your miscues, you could always say that you were never blown out and always had kept it close.
Even more mystifying were the 391 yards rushing you gave up to the Ducks. That’s not a very USC-like performance, and there are few comparable efforts. The last time your defense looked like this was in 2005 when everyone clamored to call you the best team ever. But we learned that year that you can only go as far as your defense takes you, and that hasn’t been very far based on its performance the last three weeks.
This doesn’t have to be all bad. Remember the good times?
There was 2004, when you did the West Coast proud by running the table and winning a national championship. And who could forget all of those memorable non-conference matchups in which you more than lived up to your reputation? You helped raise my profile as a conference when I needed it most, and for that I am in your debt.
When our run first started, I needed you. People said, “The Pac-10 is at its best when USC is strong,” and you helped give West Coast football some stability. Heck, when we first started our run, you shared the title with Washington State. Look at where the Cougars are now.
We can still be friends, right? In fact, I’m still going to need you. Depending on what happens, I’ll still need you to stick up for me in the Holiday Bowl — or maybe even a BCS game, if you get your act together. Maybe a change of scenery would do you good after all those repetitive Rose Bowls.
And there’s a possibility we could find our way back together at some point. People thought our run was over after your last loss in Eugene in 2007, but somehow we found a way back together.
But for now, I hope you don’t mind if I see how things go with the Ducks. They’ve really impressed us and will probably be our representative for the Rose Bowl this year, so it’s for the best if I get to know them a little bit better. If you cross paths again, give Oregon my number and tell the Ducks we should talk.
I know this is hard after seven years. But maybe we can just consider this a break and see what happens in 2010. Maybe you’ll come back rejuvenated and that old spark will be there again.
But hey, we’ll always have Pasadena.

Makes one wonder; what is going on with the offense. Barkley’s performance against Oregon State wasn’t spectacular–is it the receivers who constantly drop the passes? Is it some internal riff-raff going on with the Carrol’s coordinators? Why have we lost so many good coordinators–Chow, Zar, etc? Is Pete micro-managing?? I think all these questions deserve some consideration in the overall team’s performance.
Who cares what the little ducks think…they know what coming there way next year. Enjoy this duckies, because its the last one you will taste in a VERY long time. USC will not be this vulnerable again for the next 3 years. Just dont do a face plant and make us go to the annual big 10 beat down again…i would like to go toa nother bowl against another conf for once.
FIGHT ON!
GIles, refereeing, seriously?  That’s ridiculous to mention, SC got their asse s handed to them, just accept it, no excuses!
You guys don’t sound like typical USC fans at all…except for that part after Enjoy and USC…
USC cannot be expected to dominate EVERY year.  No one team completely own a conference, unless you count BSU’s dominance over the WAC, but who cares about the WAC?  The fact that UO has a good team this year doesn’t mean much in the grand scheme of things.  Remember, Oregon has an embarrassing post-season record – They didn’t win a bowl game from 2002-2007.  USC can always be counted on to be a contender for the Pac-10 championship, and the national title.  What other teams in the Pac-10 can you say that about?
OK then Seriously.  Maybe all the other teams in the Pac-10 should just always play for second place behind your beloved Trojans.  Oregon has just recently become a team that contends for the Pac-10 title in any given year.  Don’t think that USC has never seen  bad times.  I remember some Hackett years when USC wasn’t so good.  You need to take the loss and show some pride.  You came to state of Oregon and got worked the last couple of years.
Enjoy your one night stand with your one hit wonder. Just remember the last time, we one uped them and you came back crying. Besides, the Refereeing wasn’t that great anyway. Too much premature flagging or not being able to flag at all.
Just a fluke year.  USC NEVER comes to the state of Oregon and looses.  The referees were so terrible.  So terrible that they caused SC to give up over 600 yards of offense AND a buttload of points.  Yes……chalk this loss up to the zebras.
STFU ….. You are a fool…..

Save the applause and point your finger.  Blame Al Gore — the person who many credit for bringing us the Internet.
Whether or not Gore is actually the so-called “Father of the Internet” is questionable, but nonetheless the Internet’s takeover is quite evident.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Today there’s no way around it. You can’t destroy it; its fiber-optic backbone is so protected it is virtually indestructible. While we’re sleeping, its zipping networks move at lightning-fast speeds, connecting billions of people in a sensitive system of wireless, fault-tolerant networks.
During the day, it churns even faster, producing continuous output as celeb-obsessed visitors maniacally click their mouses for a hot, new gossip update.
To feed our ravenous demand to consume, the sensation of the 24-hour news cycle has become the Internet’s extraordinary result. The consequences, good and bad, have been life changing.
In the celebrity world, bloggers — Perez Hilton, Just Jared and Nikki Fink to name a few — help feed this global machine, not to mention the products of paparazzi-infested sites like Hollywood TV and TMZ, courtesy of Harvey Levin and his gang of tear-down reporters.
Even before a once trivial concept like “celebrity gossip” achieved the status among the upper echelon of societal obsessions, the possibilities of the Internet were still quite endless. Through the Internet, you do just about anything: connect with friends, buy a car, find your soul mate, watch a movie (illegally, of course) weeks before it was released in theaters and do research for a paper, saving you the dreadful trip to the library.
Also because of the Internet, books have been replaced with Wikipedia, talking has turned into Tweeting and the English language is no more understandable with the parading amount of Web acronyms peeking into our everyday conversation (OMG is a popular one).
Despite the myths and disbelief, last week the world learned that celebrities and their homes are actually prey to the big, bad, scary Internet.
In an appropriate use of the blame game, the cops had it out for cyberspace in the ongoing investigations of burglarized celebrity homes in the Hollywood Hills. With a not-so-average victim list including celebrities Lindsay Lohan, Megan Fox, Paris Hilton and Orlando Bloom as well as countless others, police arrested five teenagers, known as the “Burglar Bunch,” on suspicion of stealing millions of dollars worth of possessions from the homes of A-listers. Jewelry, designer goods, Rachel Bilson’s jeans — anything you can imagine but can’t afford — were taken by the young intruders, all of whom were just shy of their 20th birthdays.
If you’re wondering how could this have happened, say it with me: Blame the Internet.
During further investigation, the police discovered that celebrity websites, social media and online forums served as the main planning tools, that aided the teen thieves on their robberies of the rich and famous. With a few clicks here and there, the group searched online for specific valuables they were interested in, found the addresses of celebrity homes and began to carefully monitor where celebrities were and, more importantly, when they were away.
With gossip sites uploading new content almost the minute it happens, the Burglar Bunch’s planning strategies were not only resourceful but also brilliant — in a kleptomaniac, stalker kind of way. When houses were finally left unattended, the suspects broke in through unlocked doors and windows, and, when that didn’t work, they crept through the doggy door. Besides the fact that they were mostly successful, even more shocking was that the break-ins have been going on since October 2008.
All things considered, the public is left with two glaring points:
1. Celebrities need to invest in better home security, and;
2. Information is so abundant and public via the Internet that it has actually become dangerous. With hackers and privacy invasion running rampant, burglars have also found a way to log on to enhance their methods.
Despite this, entertainment news outlets are furiously tugging and pulling at celebrities’ daily lives to put out content. With the around-the-clock news cycle, the situation is no better. For all the good of the Internet’s role in society, the visitors with questionable intentions could very well misuse this incessant stream of information.
Moreover, if sensitive information is not properly protected, the same digging-and-finding technique across the Internet could be applied to areas far more serious than celebrities, such as issues dealing with the government. Still, we can’t forget that the inability to regulate everything that goes online has allowed for unparalleled creativity and vast technological development.
So while we point the finger at a computer, maybe it’s best to just lock up the culprits.

Wow, unlocked doors. Fascinating. Even I have an alarm system…
But anywhoo, I don’t understand why tabloids even exist. I know this article is mainly using that as a point to explain the down side to the internet, but what really got me is that “entertainment news outlets are furiously tugging and pulling at celebrities’ daily lives to put out content.” I can’t see how anyone can stalk someone just to put out a quick article. Everyone knows off the top of their heads that they’re mostly lies put together like a soap opera where unbelievably dramatic scandals happen in broad daylight, but I can’t see how someone can base their career on merely digging up all the dirt on celebs. Hmm, I guess this is what I want to say, get a life folks. I wonder if gossip magazines (or gossip blogs at that) didn’t exist, would people be more apt to make changes in their own lives?

There are a lot of theoretical arguments these days about how much power non-state actors can legitimately wield in a globalized world.
Last week, a panel of French judges made a decision strongly in favor of traditional sovereignty, throwing out a case led by Transparency International and human rights group Sherpa before its first hearing.
Matteo Marjoram | Daily Trojan
Transparency International is renowned worldwide for its important work in monitoring global corruption. It rates political bodies around the world on everything from their level of democratization to their national systems, not to mention the calculations made on its infamous global corruption barometer.
Yet when the directors of TI decided to go head-to-head in court with three African leaders, they vastly overstepped their boundaries.
The case revolved around President Denis Sassou-Nguesso of the Republic of the Congo, President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea and the recently deceased former President Omar Bongo of Gabon, all of whom were accused of embezzling national funds.
The three leaders denied the charges, though there is substantial incriminating evidence that this was the case.
Particularly important is the fact that each owned luxury cars and homes in expensive parts of Paris and on the Rivera, purchases TI argues couldn’t possibly have been made with their legal salaries.
But why these particular leaders? Why now? Surely corruption exists within a large number of governments, many of whose leaders are exploiting their states’ resources and committing more flagrant acts of corruption than these three.
None of these countries’ human rights records compare to that of Sudan, Angola, Burma or North Korea, just to name a few states known for their extreme corruption.
In fact, it’s likely that TI chose to attack these particular leaders because their history and current political climate happened to support TI’s broader goals.
Right now, non-governmental organizations are challenging the system of sovereign states, seeking to find new ways to increase their legitimacy and power. Taking these men to court would have been an important breakthrough in altering the existing international power structure in favor of non-state actors.
Of course, TI knew better than to take on a leader whose response could have significant political repercussions. No matter how much corruption occurs in Angola, for instance, no one is going to step in because of its oil resources.
Similarly, no one will seriously challenge North Korea, because of the threat of nuclear weapons. The same holds for other corrupt — but strategically important — regimes.
The leaders of these three states were particularly easy targets thanks to their colonial history. As members of the Francophonie, they share a common French colonial history.
And, although Gabon is one of the most prosperous countries in the region, and Equitorial Guinea has high hopes for its developing oil resources, none of these states are particularly important on a global scale.
TI thought the French courts would be willing to take this case because of France’s historically paternalistic relationship with its colonies and the fact that a large part of these leaders’ wealth was held within French territory.
And so, because purchases were made in France, the French are implicated by proxy in the embezzlement of these states’ public funds.
This complication meant that if the French court initially rejected the case, it would be refusing to acknowledge its own country’s failures, a troubling prospect for any national judiciary.
So when the case was first presented in May, the court agreed to take it on. Fortunately, its position changed with further consideration.
It is certainly true that corruption is a terrible problem and there should be some way of forcing corrupt rulers to face justice. But this is a problem for the United Nations to resolve most likely through the International Criminal Court — not a group of activists.
A trial in a foreign national court, by a non-governmental organization, is truly a slap in the face to any sovereign ruler.
Africa’s leaders deserve the same respect that heads of state in any other part of the world would demand. That Transparency International and Sherpa would have the audacity to publicly take such an obviously discriminatory step is as much a reflection on the system as it is upon their poor judgment.
Transparency International issued a statement on its website promising to appeal the French court’s decision, stating that the decision “only demonstrates how much further the French legal system has yet to evolve in order to allow specialized organizations to fulfill their rightful role.”
The group’s tone is petulant and self-important; however, it’s important to remember that the members of Transparency International do have the best of intentions. Now they just need to learn their place, which undoubtedly rests somewhere far below that of national leaders — even those whose actions we cannot approve.

“I heard this was the last show here. Is that true?” Chris Mojan asked an audience that was, in fact, gathered for the final show at the Knitting Factory Hollywood on Oct. 25. Like many of the musicians on the evening’s ticket, Mojan, lead guitarist for the Detroit-based group Fireworks, seemed unaware that his band was playing on the iconic LA venue’s closing night.
“Seems like a cool place,” he added dismissively, and launched into the next song.
Closing time · After a decade in an ever-changing area on Hollywood Boulevard, the Knitting Factory Hollywood closed its doors last Saturday. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
Mojan’s on-stage riffing with the audience wasn’t the only indication that some of the scheduled bands learned it was the Knitting Factory Hollywood’s final show only minutes before taking the stage.
“I think we played the last Knitting Factory show in New York, too,” said Sparks the Rescue frontman Alex Roy.
Finding itself at the very end of its lease, which terminated on Halloween, the Knitting Factory left its problematic Hollywood Boulevard location the night of Oct. 25 not with a bang, but a whimper. The decidedly bang-less end-all featured Hit the Lights, Fireworks, Sparks the Rescue, There For Tomorrow and local band Oh No Not Stereo. The quasi-intimate concert space, which is reported to have turned a profit only one month in its nine-year residency in Hollywood, opted to not renew its lease when it expired Saturday.
Chris Diaz, a former talent buyer for the Knitting Factory Hollywood, said that talks regarding the club’s decision suggested a definite interest in maintaining a presence in LA while acknowledging the significant problems with the club’s current surroundings.
“It was pretty unanimous around the office that we wanted a club in Los Angeles, but we did not want to stay where we were,” said Diaz, whose job entailed booking the club, among other things. “It wasn’t really a question of shutting down the company as a whole in the city, it was more a question of just shutting down where we’re at right now so that we could be reborn somewhere else.”
In its almost 10-year tenure on Hollywood Boulevard, the Knitting Factory Hollywood has seen significant changes in the area, most notably the introduction of the high-end Hollywood & Highland shopping center. According to Diaz, the commerce-oriented developments changed the tone and atmosphere of the area to something less appealing to the club’s target audience.
“A lot of local people that wanted to come see shows … didn’t really like going up to a tourist-y section of Hollywood,” Diaz said. “They wanted to go to a hipper section, and we were really feeling the bite of that in our ticket sales.”
Although the club’s management initially hoped that sales to out-of-town visitors and tourists might compensate for the revenue lost from displaced locals, it was disappointed to find that not to be the case. Higher-ups in the Hollywood operation found that tourists were generally uninterested in seeing touring bands while on vacation, citing the fact that people who are vacationing typically already have plans set up for the nights they’re in town. Outreach efforts and marketing campaigns targeting area hotels sought to encourage guests to check out shows while in the city, but those were largely unsuccessful.
Knitting Factory Entertainment — a nationwide franchise that has other venues in Reno, Nev., Spokane, Wash., Boise, Idaho and Brooklyn, N.Y. — appears to be leaving no stone unturned in its search for a new home in Los Angeles. Neighborhoods considered include Los Feliz, Silver Lake, North Hollywood, West Hollywood, Santa Monica, Hermosa Beach, Pasadena, East LA and Downtown Los Angeles.
Lily Sims-Williams, a junior majoring in music industry and former Knitting Factory intern, remembers Silver Lake being discussed as a potential site.
“I think Silver Lake would be a good idea,” Sims-Williams said. “There’s a lot of young people [there].”
The LA Live complex has come up in relocation talks, but Diaz says he is wary of becoming part of an area that would likely equate to more of the same.
“I don’t think we would really want to be a part of the LA Live area, but that would be the general location that would probably benefit us the most,” Diaz said. “We would want to be a few blocks away, tucked away in the cool little corner, you know, just out of reach, but everybody knows that we’re there.”
Much like Knitting Factory New York’s recent move from the its home of 15 years in the Tribeca area to a Brooklyn location that needed to be rebuilt from the ground up, the anticipated LA relocation is expected to involve some site construction.
“We kind of want to do the same thing in LA, but we don’t want to build out as much,” said Diaz, who now acts as a talent buyer for the Knitting Factory’s Brooklyn venue. “We’re looking for sort of a building that already has what we need [so] we can just put the paint up, build a stage, plug everything in, and go.”
Any new venue will, like the now-defunct Hollywood location, almost certainly be all-ages as well. With its Vans Warped Tour-style musical offerings, Knitting Factory shows primarily draw a 16 to 25 demographic, so under-21 ticket sales are just as significant as revenue generated bar-side.
With Ohio-based Hit the Lights headlining, the venue’s final lineup stayed true to the venue’s target audience. For a last hurrah, however, the bands’ sets were surprisingly low-energy — only Fireworks, a five-piece pop-punk outfit from Michigan, managed to generate any semblance of earnest rowdiness.
And although local opener Oh No Not Stereo was a last minute addition to Hit the Lights’ Mana Tour when I Rival was unable to come along for the ride, the group was clearly grateful just to be there.
Not everyone could take the club’s closure with the same measure of nonchalance boasted by the bands booked for the night. Sims-Williams said she was sad as she took a final walk around the venue she came to know so well as an intern last year.
“It’s really weird for me to know that this is going to be the last time I walk around back here,” she said backstage.
With any luck, the transition to a new venue won’t take more than a year, but Los Angeles is losing — at the very least temporarily — an integral venue in the city’s music landscape.
According to Diaz, the expected relocation is necessary and going to be for the better.
“No one really wants to drive up to Hollywood, pay $8 for parking and spend their night in a mini-mall,” he said.
Only time — and frustrated concertgoers — will tell if Diaz is right.

Time for debate
We would to like to welcome Mr. Omar Barghouti, from the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic & Cultural Boycott of Israel, to USC. Born in Qatar and raised in Egypt, this self-titled Palestinian holds an American degree in engineering. In coming to USC, we hope that he sees our campus for not only its aesthetic beauty, but for what it offers students — a chance to be intellectual, progressive members of the global community. We’d like to stress how important such discussions are, and although our views vehemently oppose those of Mr. Barghouti, we are intent on voicing our opposition to his appearance in a civilized, intellectual manner.
While Mr. Barghouti pushes for the cowardly boycott of Israel, he continues to reap the benefits of all that which he speaks against. Presently, Mr. Barghouti is studying toward his degree at Tel Aviv University (TAU), in the heart of Israel. TAU is Israel’s third-ranked university. Mr. Barghouti seeks the demise of TAU, Israeli academia and the Jewish State in general. It is important to recognize that TAU has rejected any call to expel him. This proves Israel’s dedication to academic integrity and equality regardless of race and religion, and clearly illustrates that she strives for understanding and coexistence.
This begs the question — if he has such disdain for Israel, her people and her institutions, why does he insist on studying at an Israeli university?
We kindly ask that before you blindly subscribe to Mr. Barghouti’s racist doctrine of intolerance in the guise of academic freedom, you remember that Israel, her people and her government will always be a partner for peace. She is a beacon for freedom and rights in the Middle East, regardless of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation. Since her establishment in 1948, Arabs, like Mr. Barghouti, enjoy more rights in Israel then they ever could in any Arab state.
’sc students for israel, trojans for israel
well, all i can say about this letter to the editor is that is it as silly as who wrote it: I do not see anything in it more than accusing Barghouti of being raised elsewhere instead of his homeland (which is the case with MOST palestinians who were forced to leave their land in 1948 and again in 1967), or the other accusation that he is a phd student at TAU- which if who wrote this actually attended the lecture would have heard his reply to THAT particular question: he did not deny that it is an excellent university (i’m assuming it’s why he’s there after being a columbia university graduate), but he did explain that there are no other options for someone under occupation and apartheid, palestinian universities have not been able to have enough faculty to start any phd program close to his home. so let’s not rub that in, it’s a shame that you didn’t attent or listen carefully before sending this. talk about his ideas… his thought, not his upbringing or current status as a student! I am a proud Jew, and i ask everyone to open their eyes to what are facts. PLEASE. israel did not ‘allow’ arabs freedom of anything. that’s a fact. we are the next intellectuals, as hard as it is to accept the other’s story, it is the truth. And maria, he NEVER mentioned anything about ethnic cleansing the jews, i wouldn’t be writing this if he did. no lies, ENOUGH lying and supporting killing in my name. yevarekhekha hael.
one last thing: Daily Trojan, do your homework. we’re a university not highschool radio.
I also find it interesting you use terminology like “genocide against the Jews” considering that when Israel was preparing to invade Gaza they promised a “Shoah”.
What about Mr. Horowitz? Are his views not equally reprehensible?
Oh whoops. Someone doesn’t want the Israeli Army to bomb women and children. That must mean he wants to annihilate the Jews.
Maria, will you ever grow the fuck up?
Actually, shame on USC for allowing a racist like Omar Barghouti, who supports the ethnic cleansing of Jews, and preaches the destruction of Israel, to step foot on its campus.  And shame on the Muslim Student Union for promoting racism, anti-Semitism, and endorsing the genocide of Jews.  I heard that at the debate, Barghouti denied that the Jewish people are even a nation- denying their right to exist, and their rights to self-determination is the first step in trying to annihilate them.  If you stand for peace, you will stand against him.
Since when can student groups at USC write a letter to the editor that is published in the Daily Trojan when the Daily Trojan failed to send a reporter to cover the event in question?  Regardless of where you stand on the issue, what was the event?  Who sponsored the event?  Who were the other invited speakers?  What did they say?  How many people showed up?  Shame on the Daily Trojan for publishing a letter to the editor in response to an event that wasn’t even covered by the Daily Trojan.

Renowned author and self-described atheist Christopher Hitchens goes toe-to-toe with conservative evangelical pastor Douglas Wilson in a new documentary, Collision.
The film tracks Hitchens and Wilson through a series of debates held across the United States as they debate the question: “Is Christianity good for the world?”
Head-to-head · Christopher Hitchens (left) and Douglas Wilson debate the purpose of Christianty in Collision. - Photo courtesy of Lobeline Communications
Interspersed with grainy candid footage of the two authors, the film presents not only a clash of worldviews but also one of lifestyles: Wilson, the kind Idaho family man, versus Hitchens, the acerbic public intellectual. The camaraderie and respect that exists between the two in spite of profound differences is remarkable to watch.
Both thinkers represent pure strains of their respective ideologies. Hitchens argues consistently that religion “can’t be believed by a thinking person” and that the precepts of Christianity are fundamentally evil. Wilson counters by arguing that Christianity is objectively true, beautiful and good and that every position, including that of Hitchens, is a faith-based position.
By describing religion as mankind’s “first and worst” attempt to understand a frightening world, the ever-witty Hitchens outright rejects the notion of a celestial dictator and the scapegoating of sins that abolishes individual responsibility. Wilson argues persistently that Hitchens uses Christian morality to attack Christianity, and Hitchens does little to refute this claim.
For the most part, this is vintage Hitchens. Those who are already familiar with his best-selling book, God Is Not Great, will not find anything new in these debates. What makes the film worthwhile is the honesty and quality of the arguments, and the sincerity of belief on both sides of the religious divide. In one scene, Wilson shines new light on the parable of the Good Samaritan and Hitchens expresses genuine appreciation of this new perspective. These are not stiff ideologues; both Hitchens and Wilson are receptive to unexplored insights and interpretations.
There are plenty of problems with this documentary. Flashing subtitles and captions often prove distracting when their purpose is to better define the terms being discussed on screen. The quality of the footage ranges from mediocre to YouTube and the candid shots in bars and cafés are riddled with background noise. For a documentary that is all about the dialogue between these two men, it is a shame that so often its obscured by technical distractions.
That said, this is a film worth seeing. Religion remains one of the preeminent variables shaping and dividing the world we live in, especially in the United States, where a rising tide of unbelief challenges an overwhelmingly religious population. The questions raised in this enthralling 90-minute film are important, and watching first-rate intellectuals go for the jugular is entertainment of the highest order.
Collision promises a battle royale between Christianity and atheism and delivers on every punch. Although it is unlikely that the arguments put forth by Hitchens and Wilson will change many minds, the quality of the debate will doubtlessly open them to alternate points of view.

The No. 6 USC women’s golf team looks to bounce back and finish the fall season strong this week at the Turtle Bay Collegiate Invitational in Kahuku, Hawaii.
The first day of the tournament finished with the Women of Troy in fourth place at six-over, 12 strokes behind UC Davis. Junior Lizette Salas and freshman Cyna Rodriguez led the team with a one-under 71 to tie for fifth place. Senior Stefanie Endstrasser, tied for 27th, fired a two-over 74. Senior Caroline Kim finished one stroke back of Endstrasser at three-over 75, leaving her tied for 40th, while sophomore Inah Park finished tied for 79th after her eight-over 80.
Traveling to Hawaii this week along with Kim, Park and Rodriguez is senior All-American Belen Mozo. The trio of Kim, Park and Rodriguez is competing for roster spots for the spring season. Mozo, who withdrew from the Fall Preview with a shoulder injury, is traveling with the team to play as an individual.
After winning the first tournament of its season, the team has slipped in each succeeding tournament, finishing sixth and 16th in its previous two tournaments. The 16th place finish was the Women of Troy’s worst since the 2005 NCAA Championship, when they finished 11th and broke a streak of 32 straight top-10 finishes.
This week, behind returning All-Americans Salas and Endstrasser, the team looks to restart that streak. Salas has played twice this season, finishing 25th and 12th while missing one tournament to attend a wedding. Endstrasser made her season debut last weekend at the University of North Carolina Women’s Fall Preview, where she struggled and finished 79th.
The team will again miss sophomore All-American Jennifer Song, who is just returning from South Korea after competing in the Hana Bank-KOLON Championship, an LPGA tournament. Song, the individual winner of both collegiate tournaments she has played this season, finished tied for 65th.
The tournament wraps up on Wednesday.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Department of Public Safety crime/incident summary between Thursday, Oct. 29 and Sunday, Nov. 1.
Crimes against a person
On Oct. 30 between 1:25 a.m. and 1:55 a.m., DPS officers detained a student who was observed drinking from a bottle of champagne outside 29th Street. When they attempted to issue him a citation, he became combative, striking them multiple times.  The officers subdued and detained the student, who was then arrested and booked.
On Oct. 30 at 7:59 p.m., DPS officers responded to a report of a fight in progress at the General William Lyon University Center. The subjects had been separated before the officers arrived, and they subsequently determined that a student was involved in a dispute with a non-USC man during a basketball game.  The man then punched the student’s friend in the chest when he attempted to intervene.  None of the involved parties were injured or desired criminal prosecution of the matter, and the non-USC man was escorted from the premises without further incident.
On Oct. 30 between 8:10 p.m. and 8:30 p.m., DPS officers responded to a report of a fight in progress at the University Parking Center. Upon their arrival they contacted a non-USC man who was bleeding from the nose and mouth.  None of the other combatants were present, and the male refused to cooperate when  the officers questioned him about the incident.  An LAFD RA unit was requested. The RA unit treated the male then transported him to a hospital for additional medical treatment.
On OCt. 30 between 11:10 p.m. and 11:40 p.m.,  DPS officers responded to a complaint of a loud party on 29th Street. While they were assisting security officers in shutting it down, a student reported he was threatened by another student who said that he had a knife.  The officers detained the second student and confiscated the knife, but the reporting student did not desire criminal prosecution of the matter, and the second student was released.
Crimes against property
On Oct. 29 a suspect entered an unsecured location in Parking Structure D and removed 50 unattended trash cans.
On Oct. 29 at 11:31 a.m., a student reported losing a bicycle at Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism.
On Oct. 29 at 10:06 p.m., a suspect kicked a vehicle parked at Chez Ronnee, denting the rear driver’s side quarter panel.
On Oct. 30 between 1:30 a.m. and 2:45 a.m., DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect vandalizing vehicles near Parkside Apartments and detained him for investigation.  The officers checked the vehicles and observed that the suspect had been writing obscenities in the condensation on the windows with his finger, but there was no permanent damage.  The suspect was then advised against trespassing on university property and was released.
On Oct. 30 between 11:36 p.m. and 11:45 p.m., a non-USC man, who was the guest of a student, kicked a hole in a wall in Fluor Tower following an argument with his girlfriend.
On OcT. 31 at 2:25 a.m., a student drove a university vehicle into a non-USC man’s vehicle at the intersection of 29th and Hoover streets, causing moderate damage to both of the vehicles.
Miscellaneous incidents
On Oct. 29 between 4:10 p.m. and 4:12 p.m., DPS officers responded to a student who was struck by a vehicle while riding her bicycle near Entrance Gate 8.  The student complained of back pain, so an LAFD RA unit was requested.  The unit responded and examined the student, then transported her to Good Samaritan Hospital for medical treatment. LAPD officers were also requested and responded to conduct a traffic investigation.
On Oct. 29 at 9:13 p.m., DPS officers responded to a report of several people trapped in an elevator at Fluor Tower.  FMS personnel also responded, but upon their arrival, they found that the subjects had exited the elevator and were no longer present.
On Oct. 30 at 6:05 p.m., DPS officers responded to a student who cut her hand with a knife while carving a pumpkin at the University Religious Center.  The student had wrapped her hand with paper towels, and she refused to be examined by the officers for fear of reopening the wound. A friend then transported the student to Good Samaritan Hospital for medical treatment.
On Oct. 30 between 11:34 p.m. and 12:02 a.m., DPS officers responded to an intoxicated non-USC man who sustained a cut above his eye when he fell while trying to climb up to a third- floor balcony at Troy Hall. An RA Unit treated the male and offered transportation for additional medical treatment, but he declined and was released.
On Oct. 31 between 11:52 a.m. and 12:13 p.m., DPS officers responded to a staff member who sustained a cut to his head when he fell and hit it on a vehicle parked at a loading dock of The Lot MarketPlace. The RA Unit treated the staff member, then transported him to Los Angeles Metropolitan Hospital for additional medical treatment.
On Oct. 31 at 11:05 p.m., DPS officers and LAFD responded to a fire alarm activation at Sigma Chi because of fog from a fog machine.  No smoke or fire was found.  LAFD reset the alarm then cleared the building for reentry.
On nov. 1 between 1:40 a.m. and 1:45 a.m., DPS officers responded to a report of several suspects prowling at Chez Ronnee and detained them for investigation.  The officers found one of the suspects in possession of a bag containing multiple ecstasy pills, and he was arrested and booked. The other suspects were questioned and released at the scene.
On nov. 1 between 5 a.m. and 7:19 a.m., DPS officers detained a former fraternity member for investigation after a student reported that he awoke to find the subject in his room at Pi Kappa Alpha without permission.  The suspect was found in possession of an iPod that belonged to another student, but the officers were unable to contact him to determine if a crime had occurred.  The officers then confiscated the iPod and the suspect was released.

Having Halloween on a Saturday seemed to necessitate four days of celebrating, which is why by the time the actual Halloween rolled around, so many people seemed to have given up on costumes.
Sure, at first it’s fun to get emotionally invested in clever costume that demonstrates your originality/hot body. But there are only so many nights where being one of 23 Lady GaGa’s is tolerable. That’s why you start seeing a lot of people wearing zip-up hoodies and ipods: “I’m a Mac.” Yeah, good job.
Thanks to the raves near campus, Halloweekend was great for people watching. At 2:30 p.m., a would-be raver was spotted walking around the Shrine wearing this get-up. Call it a lazy costume, but it took a lot more commitment than most people would have been willing to demonstrate; you Teenage Mutant Ninja turtle costume most likely did not require a full brazillian wax.
