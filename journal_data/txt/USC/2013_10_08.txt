The USG Senate meeting on Tuesday night featured presentations from the Political Student Assembly and the Women’s Student Assembly, as well as a proposed amendment to USG’s bylaws and election code.
Political Student Assembly Director Justin Bogda said in his presentation that he wanted to increase political activism at USC.
“We want to politicize our campus,” Bogda said. “We have monthly debates, but we want to open up to political issues happening at USG as well as national and international politics.”
PSA includes the university’s student-run political organizations, such as the College Democrats and College Republicans, along with advocacy groups such as Student Alliance for Nationalism and Democracy, an anti-genocide organization. PSA has increased its political activism on campus by sponsoring events such as Bill Maher at USC and National Voter Registration Day.
“We’d like to be utilized as a resource for political events on campus,” Bogda said.
Upcoming PSA events include a book talk with Palestinian advocate Josh Ruebner, two debates, and a Know Your Rights Campaign co-sponsored by the USChange Movement.
The Women’s Student Assembly also gave a presentation detailing its agenda to reduce sexual crime and gender-based discrimination at USC.
“We’re trying to make feminism more accessible and more inclusive on campus,” WSA Assistant Director Taylor Markey said.
WSA Co-Director Kaya Masler addressed the issue of sexual abuse in the university community.  Masler said many sexual crimes go unreported on campus, and her goal is to make the reporting process easier and more transparent for students.
“Our whole advocacy campaign is to get USC to go beyond compliance,” Markey said. “We want USC to go from defense to offense on these issues, and we want more students to get involved.”
The WSA holds discussion groups each week, and hosts events to promote gender-based advocacy.
Following the WSA presentation, Elections and Recruitment Co-directors Andrew Cho and Taylor Rottjakob proposed an amendment to USG bylaws that, if passed, would add an extra day of voting to the USG elections in the spring. The amendment is a response to low voter turnout in past USG elections.
“The percentage of undergraduates who vote is relatively low,” Rottjakob said.
If the proposal passes, USC students will have an extra Monday to cast their votes on Election Week. The directors feel that this extra day could be critical for students who are reluctant to vote, or who have conflicts with their class schedule.
“Having an extra day can only help the election process. Maybe students have class during the day on Tuesday and Wednesday, based on their scheduling,” Cho said.
USG will vote on the bylaw amendment and the election code revision in their meeting next Tuesday at 7 p.m. The meeting is open to the public.

USC was awarded the JedCampus Seal in recognition of its strong mental health program on Oct. 3.
Mentally aware · USC Engemann Student Health Center works to raise awareness of mental health issues for students on campus. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
The USC Engemann Student Health Center completed a voluntary self-assessment reviewing its mental health and suicide prevention programming on campus in order to receive this recognition from The Jed Foundation, which focuses on promoting emotional health and preventing suicide. The process also allowed USC to receive confidential feedback, which will benefit the university’s programming and resources.
The health center works to raise awareness of mental health and help students suffering from mental issues in various ways. The center has “gatekeepers” on campus who are trained to identify and engage students who would benefit from psychiatric help. USC also runs Say Something, a campaign that teaches students how to handle mental health problems.
Dr. Ilene Rosenstein, director of Student Counseling Services at the health center, said she attempts to reach a variety of students with the center’s programs.
“One of the things the Jed Foundation really commented on is that we’re a very big campus but we really have shown that we have also a big and complex system that works, reaching people from all different schools, all different programs, all different backgrounds,” Rosenstein said.
Mental health issues are prevalent among college students, and three-quarters of mental health disorders begin before age 24. According to the Jed Foundation, 21.2 percent of college students received a psychiatric diagnosis or were treated for mental health issues last year.
Some students said they were already aware of the mental health issues on campus.
“[College students] are going through so much change and so many different things in the environment,” said Kelly Gubbens, an undeclared sophomore. “I think mental health issues are definitely prevalent on campus.”
Officials aid that mental health is not fully recognized as an issue on college campuses.
“I think we have many students who perceive that everyone else is perfect and doing fine and really many people are struggling. thriving, too, but some people are really feeling that they want to function at a better level with a higher quality of life,” Rosenstein said.
Many students said they believe it is important to raise mental health awareness in order to deal with issues that are especially prevalent among young adults.
“I don’t think they should be embarrassed but I definitely do think, currently, a stigma exists,” said Mina Saffarian, a junior majoring in policy, planning and development. “A lot of people wouldn’t want to admit if they’re on medication or anything just because I feel like people would be afraid that they’re judged more and then kind of make the problem worse.”
Research shows that ignoring emotional health issues can lead to substance abuse, self-harm and suicide, the second leading cause of death among college students. Other students agreed that part of the problem is a tendency to ignore mental health problems instead of discussing them.
“I think the problem with it is that not enough people talk about it,” said Tamara Flosse, a senior majoring in business administration and environmental studies. “A lot of times everybody knows that everybody else has issues or does drugs, like enhancing drugs, and it has become so normal that people don’t talk about it anymore and assume that it’s the norm when really it shouldn’t be.”
Jaime Travers, a junior majoring in political science and politics, philosophy and law, said that being aware of mental health issues would benefit many students.
“I think it’s also important for people to be aware of what can trigger these mental issues because I know a lot of drugs can trigger it,” Travers said.

In honor of Mental Health Awareness Week, USC Free Minds United presented an evening devoted entirely to understanding students’ mental health challenges on Tuesday.
“Mental Health: A Dialogue” included guest speakers from different fields, such as the Engemann Student Health Center Counseling office, the USC Department of Public Safety, the Didi Hirsch Suicide Prevention Center and the Keck Hospital of USC.
The co-presidents of the organization, students Danny Lee and Patra Childress, spoke about the purpose of the event and how they selected the panelists for the event.
“[The event hopes to address] mental health in university life and the general culture at USC and how it promotes mental wellness,” Lee said.
Free Minds was established as a student organization in the spring of 2012. The group works to raise awareness about mental illness in the USC community through film.
“We started out as a small group but now we’re trying to become non-profit and open up chapters in different colleges,” Lee said.
According to Lee, the biggest misconceptions of mental health on the USC campus is the fact that people do not want to seek help.
“People want to seek help but they just don’t want to say it to their peers,” he said.
Panelists discussed different aspects of mental health and illnesses at USC, including how the USC community promotes wellness and how symptoms can be better identified.
Dr. Lynette Merriman, the assistant provost for support and advocacy, said there is no one way to approach problems about students.
“Student to student, they’re going to have unique challenges, unique limitations,” she said.
Emily Sandoval, the assistant director for the East Area in the Office of Residential Education, mentioned the different types of support the organization provides for students.
“Our level of response to make sure students are supported is [having] RAs on duty every night, graduate students on duty every night and there is a professional staff member on call,” Sandoval said.
Officer Sabrina Brown from the USC Dept. of Public Safety explained the role of the DPS in mental health situations.
“A lot of times with the DPS, it depends on basically how the information comes to us. It can be very different. What happens is when we do respond, because we’re in uniform, students think they are going to jail, and that’s not the case,” Brown said.
Some students were pleased to see the school make a point to address mental health issues.
“I thought this was a very well-spoken panel. There are a lot of people [who are] very knowledgeable about the field here so it was definitely providing very clear answers [regarding] where to go for help,” said Krysti Teng, a senior majoring in psychology. “I definitely think it’s an issue that needs to be brought to the attention within the L.A. region and the nation.”
Others believed having such an open event might help those struggling with mental illness cope.
“I think seeing the different people who deal with these problems on campus should be very comforting for students who didn’t know otherwise,” said Mary Stepanyan, a senior majoring in human development and aging.

USC Sol Price School of Public Policy hosted a conference Tuesday on the critical issues facing veterans returning from war, including re-entering the workforce and the high rates of homelessness.
Veteran support · Dean of USC Price School of Public Policy Jack Knott speaks about the importance of improving the quality of life of veterans returning from war. USC hosted a conference for public service leaders on Tuesday at Bovard Auditorium. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and USC professor Gen. David Petraeus spoke at the beginning of the conference.
Petraeus spoke about the veterans coming home from serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and reminded the audience of the tremendous service veterans provide to the nation.
“The post-9/11 veterans have come to be deservedly recognized as the new greatest generation,” he said. “America has never had a group of men and women who have spent as long in combat, with over two million of them having served in Iraq and Afghanistan.”
Petraeus also introduced the topic of supporting veterans returning from combat.
“While our country continues to provide support for our veterans and their families, we can and we should do more, and I know that those here share that conviction,” Petraeus said.
The conference featured keynote speakers that included Jacob Wood, former U.S. Marine and president and co-founder of Team Rubicon, a humanitarian disaster relief group.
Wood’s organization gathers groups of veterans who then go provide disaster relief all over the world. Humanitarian projects Team Rubicon has been involved with include relief for the victims of Hurricane Sandy and the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.
Wood said his inspiration for creating disaster relief efforts came from his experiences serving as a medical aid to people injured in natural disasters.
“When I was working on a bullet wound on a young boy, I realized that these hands that I had that were trained for war could just as easily be trained for peace,” Wood said.
Wood also spoke about veterans’ issues and how his organization combines veterans’ needs to provide for and defend their country with the need for volunteers in disaster relief.
“One problem was that we had inadequate disaster response and the other was the need [for] veterans to feel something better,” Wood said. “We sat there and realized that these aren’t actually two problems but rather two mutually supporting solutions.”
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti gave a keynote speech that emphasized assisting veterans to transition back into civilian life. Garcetti addressed the issues that veterans living in Los Angeles face.
“We need to ensure that veterans today can return home to bright futures,” he said. “Making sure that there’s basic opportunities for all Angelenos, especially those who have put their lives on the line for our nation, is essential.”
Garcetti specifically pointed to the Veterans’ Affairs offices and the lack of assistance that veterans seem to be getting from the organization.
“Veterans in Los Angeles face on average 377 days to receive responses to their Veterans’ Affairs claims. That’s unacceptable,” Garcetti said.
The mayor also addressed the issue of veterans re-entering the civilian workforce.
“Let’s also make sure that our veterans’ skills are being put to work for use in the workplace by connecting them with training and placement,” he said. “We’ve seen amazing organizations who train veterans for careers in growing industries.”
Garcetti also offered suggestions for how USC students could help the efforts providing veterans with the resources they need when returning from service.
“Setting up a student-to-student help hotline or looking for those veterans and reaching out to them would be so beneficial,” Garcetti told the Daily Trojan. “Veterans are often invisible because they look like the rest of campus, and I think students can help students better than anyone else can.”
The conference concluded with a screening of HBO’s Alive Day Memories: Home from Iraq. The documentary featured interviews with Iraq War veterans who suffered emotional trauma.
The veterans featured in the documentary recounted their “alive days”: the days they each narrowly escaped death.
One such veteran, Sgt. Bryan Anderson, described the surreal experience of losing both of his legs and his left arm in a bombing during his time in Iraq. Anderson noted that the most important thing was his independence, which was taken from him the day he was injured.
First Lt. Dawn Halfaker, who underwent an amputation of her right arm, spoke about the importance of the documentary after the screening.
“It told the story of our lives, and I’m grateful that it felt like a safe place to talk about what had happened to me,” Halfaker said.
Students responded to the documentary screening with varied insights on how to assist in veterans’ causes. Adam Syed, a junior majoring in psychology, addressed the issue of veterans’ affairs as being different than other relief efforts.
“I think veterans’ issues are a lot less hands-on than other humanitarian efforts like raising money for charity,” Syed said. “It’s not really something that one student can do alone. A lot of people have to really band together to see real results.”
Jessyka Linton, a senior majoring in political science, said she views awareness as the most important aspect of being a part of the efforts in alleviating veterans’ issues.
“Events like these are so interesting because they’re really the first step into the relief efforts,” Linton said. “You really can’t help if you’re not aware of the issues at hand, so I’d say the first thing to do is be informed about these important topics.”

Though former head coach Lane Kiffin’s high points were ultimately outweighed by his many low points, he was merely the most recent USC coach to follow this downward trajectory. Kiffin’s dismissal concluded a career arc similar to that of another coach who was unceremoniously fired only eight months prior — former USC basketball head coach Kevin O’Neill.
Athletic Director Pat Haden didn’t hire either man, but played the cautious card a little too long with both, and it cost him. Both coaches were destined for failure sooner or later, and shortly after initial success, each suffered setbacks in their public perception.
Kiffin was the man that people never really understood, with his sometimes combative relationship with the media and his apparent aversion to fully embracing the gig he once called his “dream job.” O’Neill was the man people knew too well, from a public fallout at Arizona that squashed his chances of replacing the legendary Lute Olson to an altercation with an Arizona booster in March 2011.
Both men were hired toward the end of former athletic director Mike Garrett’s tenure. O’Neill was hired in June 2009 after Tim Floyd resigned, star players DeMar DeRozan, Taj Gibson and Daniel Hackett left for the NBA Draft and top recruits such as Solomon Hill and Derrick Williams decommitted from USC and instead went to Arizona.
Kiffin did not know the severity of the NCAA sanctions when he left Tennessee in January 2010, and the effect of 10 lost scholarships per year was amplified when a wrecking ball of injuries smashed into his program.
Each found moderate success, at least in the context of expectations at USC. In his second season, O’Neill’s team went 19-15 and made it to the opening round of the NCAA Tournament, losing to eventual Final Four participant Virginia Commonwealth. Kiffin went 10-2 in 2011, defeating Oregon on the road and clobbering UCLA 50-0 in the final two weeks of the season.
O’Neill was never known as a players’ coach, and neither was Kiffin. The latter dominated the recruiting trail, but both coaches lost their players’ trust, and thus control of their programs. O’Neill was known for cussing out players in practice and had difficulty retaining his players, with many transferring to other programs.
For Kiffin, his failures were evident during the Sun Bowl debacle, Marqise Lee’s public comments on his handling of the quarterback situation and, ultimately, the frustration on players’ faces after losing to Washington State and Arizona State. Though players frequently mentioned that Kiffin was approachable when they wanted to discuss personal issues, he seemed to distance himself from them during in-game crises.
The biggest issue at hand, and the one that wore out Kiffin’s welcome faster than his infamous 29-second press conference, is the expectations of USC athletics. An obvious point, right? But in O’Neill’s case, he arrived at USC with virtually no expectations of success. If Kiffin being brought back after a 7-6 season was egregious, then what is to be made of the decision to keep O’Neill after a 6-26 campaign in 2011-12, the worst in USC’s program history?
“We graded on a curve, but we failed on the curve, too,” Haden said at the press conference following Kiffin’s firing. O’Neill stuck around because he had a new group of transfers that became eligible for the 2012-13 season. Kiffin remained after the 2012 season because he earned Haden’s confidence and brought in defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast to replace his father, Monte Kiffin.
Their tenures both ended with midseason firings during their fourth seasons. O’Neill was dismissed four games into Pac-12 play, and Kiffin was let go five games into the 2013 season. O’Neill’s replacement, interim head coach Bob Cantu, posted a 7-8 record and installed a high-tempo offense to replace O’Neill’s defensive-minded system.
We’ll see how interim head football coach Ed Orgeron has altered USC’s gameplan, but so far, he’s re-energized the team with his relentless enthusiasm. Putting cookies back on the dining table and having Roscoe’s Chicken and Waffles after practices won’t directly translate into wins, but it’ll boost the team’s morale, something that likely cratered after the Trojans’ early-season struggles.
Kiffin’s legacy, on the other hand, might not be viewed in such a positive light.
“Twenty years from now, you’ll forget that [Kiffin] even coached at USC,” former USC star wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson said on ESPN Radio 710 last week.
I don’t think O’Neill or Kiffin will be forgotten, but will instead end up as symbols of the adversity USC faced through the years of heavy NCAA sanctions.
Both ended up as stopgaps, nurses taking care of the two programs until Haden decided to call in the doctors. For the basketball program, the void has been filled by the “Shot Doctor,” Andy Enfield. For the football team, we’ll probably have to wait until December to find out who the next coach will be.
No matter who ends up taking the job, though, they’ll enter a program that has something Kiffin or O’Neill didn’t have: a near-clean bill of health.
 
“Four-Point Shot” runs every other Wednesday. To comment on this story, email Jacob at jefreedm@usc.edu or visit dailytrojan.com.
 
Haden has shown very little as AD other than being a figure head with his previous scholarly background.
He has failed in resurrecting the baseball program to at least being average. There are issues with the men
volleyball, and women soccer teams. The athletic dept. has done damage to the track program the last two
years with hindering enrollment  of quality athletes.
Mike Garrett was a wonderful running back at USC and in the NFL. He was not; however, executive material, and evidently not qualified to be a USC AD. Pat Haden, on the other hand, also played at USC and in the NFL, but was a Rhodes Scholar and a practicing attorney. Not as spectacular an athlete as Mike Garrett, he is probably a lot sharper and has a greater intellect for the position of USC AD. But time will tell, won’t it?

Though interim head coach Ed Orgeron has switched up the team’s practice style, the Trojans’ schedule has forced them to adjust their weekly routine, as they had their last practice on Tuesday before their Thursday night game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
Workhorse · In his first season as a college running back, redshirt sophomore Tre Madden is ranked fifth in the nation in carries per game. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“I couldn’t tell you what day it was,” Orgeron said. “It feels like Thursday, but it’s actually Tuesday.”
According to Orgeron, the team is in a good place mentally despite all of the changes and distractions that have taken place in recent weeks.
“Walking through the meeting room, to feel the energy and see them smiling … they’re loving practice, but now we have to go out there and perform,” Orgeron said.
Ground and Pound
With senior running back Silas Redd set to make his season debut against the Wildcats, the rotation of running backs remains uncertain for the Trojans.
“We’re going to play all of those guys,” Orgeron said. “Silas has looked pretty good, Tre [Madden] as well, and Justin Davis is ready to go.”
Freshman tailback Justin Davis, who has been nursing a sprained ankle, appeared to be moving at full speed during Tuesday’s practice.
Orgeron said he has been very impressed with freshman running back Ty Isaac, who has not yet had many opportunities during games but could work his way into USC’s already crowded tailback rotation.
As for who is going to start the game, Orgeron said he would stick with Madden, despite Redd’s return.
“Tre seems like the logical start, unless you’ve got any better suggestions,” Orgeron said.
Welcome Aboard
Orgeron announced Tuesday that veteran defensive line coach Pete Jenkins will be joining the USC coaching staff as the team’s new assistant defensive line coach.
The hire seems logical due to the fact that USC has only three defensive assistants, one of them being Orgeron, who, in addition to his job as interim head coach, also serves as the defensive line coach.
This hire will allow Orgeron to focus more on overseeing all aspects of practice rather than only the defensive line.
“After a week of being the head coach, defensive line coach, recruiting coordinator and the guy in charge of discipline, I felt like I could use a hand,” Orgeron said. “Pete is a good friend of mine and he is an excellent defensive line coach.”
Jenkins has coached with 11 NFL and college teams over his 45-year coaching career, and he has produced 17 All-SEC defensive lineman and a plethora of players who have moved on to the NFL.
“We were initially planning on hiring him as a consultant before all of this happened, but when we couldn’t find a guy on offense, we looked to Pete,” Orgeron said.
Jenkins will not be filling the position immediately, however, as the hire is not yet official.
Pep Talk
Former Trojan great and Heisman trophy winner Marcus Allen delivered a speech to the team about being a Trojan before practice on Tuesday.
“We have to set the bar high, and we’re not going to lower it for anybody,” Allen said. “It is up to you guys to not only reach it, but go beyond it and set a new standard.”
Orgeron had talked to Allen several times to get him to come to practice and talk to the team, and emphasized the importance of bringing former Trojans back because of USC’s appreciation of its storied tradition.
“It’s amazing to see the love for the university and what they have inside of them as Trojans, and I thought he did a great job for our team today,” Orgeron said. “We need to lean on these guys, and a lot of times they are able to listen to them a lot more than they listen to us,” Orgeron said.
Injury Updates
The player whose status remains most in most doubt is junior wide receiver Marqise Lee, whose condition is “very questionable” while recovering from a knee sprain, according to Orgeron.
“We still have a couple days, but it doesn’t look like he’s going to play,” Orgeron said.
Orgeron also reported that senior linebacker Morgan Breslin is not expected to play on Thursday night because of a hip injury. Redshirt freshman Jabari Ruffin, who has six tackles so far this season, will take Breslin’s spot in the starting lineup.
Freshman wide receiver Darreus Rodgers’ status for the game is also questionable, despite being more involved in practice earlier this week.
“Some of these guys are going to be game-time decisions and some of them are looking good. Others, not so good,” Orgeron said.

In anticipation of the Trojans’ first weekday football game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the USC Athletic Department announced special procedures regarding tailgating, transportation and parking that will take effect on Thursday.
New territory · USC’s game against Arizona will be the first time the team has played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on a Thursday during the BCS era. All classes will operate on their normal schedules. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Changes to typical game day logistics have been made because USC classes will be in session as usual on Thursday.
According to the webpage created by the Athletic Department detailing the changes to game day regulations, tailgating and picnicking will not be permitted within campus boundaries or on The Row. Tailgating will be allowed in Exposition Park and at the Coliseum.
Because of the tailgating restrictions, the Trojan Athletic Fund and the Galen Center Founders Club will open their tailgates to ticket holders who purchase passes. Fans will also be able to attend the first ever Cardinal & Gold Picnic at the Coliseum. In addition, Lawry’s Carvery at L.A. Live will offer a 10 percent discount to USC-Arizona ticket holders on the day of the game.
Through a partnership with CID Entertainment, the Athletic Department will offer a “Park & Ride” Trojan Express Shuttle Bus service to game attendees in the greater Los Angeles and Orange County metropolitan areas. Shuttles will pick up passengers in several locations, including Anaheim, Pasadena and Ontario, and drop off near the Coliseum and on Exposition Boulevard.
The Orange County Transportation Authority will also provide Metrolink train service from Oceanside to the Coliseum. Pickup is available at all stops in between, including Union Station.
On-campus parking lots will be closed to visitors without season parking passes. Alternatives to on-campus parking include the USC Parking Center on Grand Avenue, Parking Structures 1 and 2 on Flower Street., and The Shrine Lot. Beginning at 4 p.m., parking will also be available at the St. Vincent Elementary School at the intersection of Figueroa Street and Adams Boulevard. for $20. Parking lots at the Coliseum will open at 2 p.m. Thursday.
Additionally, the Athletic Department has partnered with L.A. Live to offer parking to USC game attendees in Lots 6 and 7 for $20. A complimentary shuttle from L.A. Live to the Coliseum will run continuously before and after the game.
Thursday’s game against Arizona will mark the team’s first game since Athletic Director Pat Haden relieved Lane Kiffin of his head coaching duties and Ed Orgeron will make his debut as interim head coach.
The Trojans (3-2, 0-2 Pac-12) will be going for their first conference win of the season after surprising losses to Washington State and Arizona State. In the team’s most recent home game against Utah State on Sept. 21, the official attendance was 63,482. On the season, USC has averaged 67,770 fans per game, which ranks No. 2 among all Pac-12 schools in average attendance, though that number represents only 72 percent of the Coliseum’s capacity.
In 2012, USC averaged 87,945 fans per game, the most in the Pac-12 and nearly 20,000 more than UCLA, who was No. 2 in the conference.
More details about changes to game day procedures for Thursday’s game can be found at weplayfor2013.com/thursday.
President Nikias,
Your invitation to tailgate at our house has been rescinded.
Best,
PIKE
Who decides whether the Row can have tailgates or not?
The powers that be think they can dictate citizen behavior on private property. Scary world we live in.

From cupcakes to macaroons, the dessert world has been through a series of trends that sparks the interest of anyone with a sweet tooth. Recently, Cronuts — a classic croissant meets glazed donut combination — have been all the rage, but a classic breakfast staple is about to take center stage: donuts.
Donut BFFs · The Jets to Basil donut is an interesting amalgamation of Italian flavors, as a donut is stuffed with strawberry jam and goat cheese and then finished with a sugar glaze and balsamic reduction. – Alegra Hueso | Daily Trojan
After 20 years of producing music for bands such as Blink 182 and Drive Like Jehu, Mark Trombino wanted to do something different. After being inspired by the donut shop Donut Man in Glendora, Calif., which stuffs fresh fruit into their glazed donuts, but Trombino decided to create his own version with a twist. A few years later, Trombino, without having any restaurant experience, decided that it was time to start his new venture, and Donut Friend, located on York Boulevard in Highland Park, was born.
While planning a menu for his new eatery, Trombino knew he wanted his donuts to be cheesy. There’s a lot of things that can go wrong with mixing sweets with cheese, so Trombino sought the expertise of various decadent grilled cheese recipes and tried to translate them to the sweet vessel of a glazed donut. After much deliberation and a plethora of donut tasting, Trombino came up with six different donut combinations that find a successful way to incorporate cheese.
One of the best examples, the GG Almond, contains gruyere and honey inside a traditional donut, topped with a sugar glaze and toasted almonds. The sharpness of the gruyere is tempered by the honey and the rest of the donut reinforces the sweetness. Another example is the Spanish Bomb, which pairs Manchengo cheese and quince paste inside a sugar glazed donut sprinkled with toasted almonds.
Perhaps the most interesting combination is the (A)pple Pi(E), a traditional donut  stuffed with caramelized apples and cheddar cheese, topped with a caramel glaze and toasted peanuts.
Donut Friend’s menu features 21 unusual and adventurous donut compilations such as the Bacon 182 — a traditional maple glaze donut with crispy bacon bit topping. The store’s best seller is the Italian-inspired Jets to Basil. The donut is a play on the classic Italian flavor combination of basil and balsamic with goat cheese, fresh strawberry jam and basil, topped with a sugar glaze and balsamic reduction.
These unique combinations are the reason that Trombino’s Donut Friend will make its mark in the dessert world. With its unique style and vivid imagination put into each of the donuts, Donut Friend will prove that donuts aren’t just meant to be breakfast food, but a decadent dessert that can be enjoyed at any time. On top of that, Donut Friend will probably be at the forefront of a new dessert revolution.
On top of a creative menu, Donut Friend gives the customer the choice to DIY (Do It Yourself). The DIY option begins with choosing a donut base (such as traditional, vanilla, chocolate cake or gluten free), then picking from a variety of fillings such as jams and compotes, creams and butters, fresh fruit or cheese, and then finishing the creation with a specific glaze and topping. Donut Friend’s goal is to offer as many ingredients as possible that customers would want to put in or on their donuts — Trombino calls this the “Pinkberry” approach. But for all the inventive flavors Donut Friend already provides, it’s hard to imagine customers coming up with anything more creative.
Donut Friend has been open for two weeks, and the customers are pouring in. The first weekend after opening, Donut Friend had lines out the door, which made even more people curious about the new business. With such a vast base of customers, Donut Friend is likely to beat the average new restaurant shelf life.
Trombino’s motto for his business is simple: “We don’t just do donuts, we do donuts differently.” Donut Friend not only offers creatively flavored donuts, but they take the role of a traditional donut shop, serving espressos, teas and coffees. Donut Friend also has a wide selection of unique soft drinks, including Better Booch (an iced kombucha tea), Margo’s Bark Rootbeer, Mexican Coke and Jarritos.
Coming soon to the menu are two donut spin-offs, including a donut pudding — think bread pudding, made with day-old donuts, and donut fritters — essentially deep fried fruit donuts. On top of that, Donut Friend plans on offering ice cream and fruit bowls in the future.
With a shifting dessert market, it takes more than a new establishment with character to stick around for longer than a year. Donut Friend appeals to the public not just as a dessert joint, but also as a fun place to snack and meet with friends. Its exciting menu and pleasant environment provide customers a rendezvous full of flavor, and with their alternative vibe, people of all walks of life will be taking a taste of what Donut Friend has to offer.

Have you ever felt the need to run a race at night covered in neon powder? No? Well, to be honest, I didn’t either up until a week ago. As a result of plenty of Facebook advertising and a post from a friend, the Blacklight Run caught my attention.
Black lights are pretty cool. They invert normal color schemes and create a contrast between bright, neon colors and a black abyss — much like how I imagine it would feel to take hardcore drugs. Since I probably won’t be getting hooked on hallucinogens anytime soon, and I’m always game to go running, the Blacklight Run seemed like an interesting activity.
Running is great exercise, especially for those lacking in the coordination and people skills required of other team-oriented sports, such as football, badminton and curling. A brisk run can clear your mind with the help of endorphins and an elevated heartbeat. Before this race, though, I had never participated in a themed running event.
Marathons with a theme are nothing new. There are rock ‘n’ roll runs, runs that push participants through muddy obstacles and runs that require the barest minimum of clothing. Undie runs have even become a staple at college campuses across the nation. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately, considering the crowd), clothing was not optional at Saturday’s race.
The Blacklight Run is most similar to the Color Run. Both involve runners wearing white clothing that will become splattered with vibrant substances and both are focused on the fun side of a 5K rather than the timing aspect. On the other hand, the Blacklight Run can only take place at night for obvious reasons. Thus, the event takes on a different tone than the sunny Color Run. A night run enables the use of glow-in-the-dark powders and LED lights, qualities unique to the Blacklight Run that gave it an almost rave-like atmosphere.
In addition to the fluorescent decorations, some of the runners exhibited that keen sense of fashion that is only a found at a rave. A few female participants were wearing brightly colored fluffies and other runners, male and female, sported tutus. Still others brought along bracelets and necklaces that would blink and flash — exactly the kind of gear you’d expect to find at a rave.
This rave aesthetic seemed to be the driving force behind the race’s marketing scheme, even evident in the pulsating electro music played by the disc jockey. I think this is what actually categorizes the 5K as worthy of the trending hashtag. The event combined 5K running, an already tried-and-true crowd pleaser, with a relatively modern music and social scene. You might even call the Blacklight Run the mashup of all 5K’s.
And though the Blacklight Run does get a passing grade for effort, (and also its charitable dedication to Children’s Miracle Network), the execution of the run left something to be desired. It is true that sometimes my imagination does run wild, but, in my humble opinion, I don’t think my expectations were asking too much.
Based on the promotional images, I anticipated a night run that would play out like a scene from Tron. I’m not saying I expected Daft Punk to suddenly appear or that the powder would be as visually awe-inspiring as the film’s special effects, but I did anticipate an event that was better organized than the result.
My running partner and I arrived at the race a little early since it was all the way out in Pomona. Another reason for arriving early was to beat the registration lines, which actually weren’t a problem. For a hot minute, I was pretty worried I wouldn’t be able to race at all since the volunteer couldn’t find my name on the registration list. The running gods smiled on me, though, as my name suddenly appeared on the list and I was allowed to run.
The next sign that this wasn’t going to be a normal race was the abundance of food trucks next to the field. Considering it was near dinnertime and we hadn’t eaten much that day, the natural decision was to get barbecue chicken strips and French fries. Only time would tell if this would be a regrettable decision.
Stomachs full and legs stretched, it wasn’t long before 6:45 p.m. arrived and we headed over to the starting line. And thus began the mass confusion. There was a shortage of volunteers informing the runners what to do or about how the course would work. It could have been that we just missed the public service announcement, but everyone seemed to be in the same confused boat as us.
After a long period of standing and waiting without any instructions, we decided to join the other runners who began taking to the track on their own. Halfway around the other side of the track, just as we had gotten into our rhythm, a voice announced the official beginning of the race.
As it turned out, running was not a top priority for any of the participants. Most people were just walking by the time we reached the majority of the crowd again. There were, after all, at least 8,000 participants in the night’s race and the crowd was certainly a motley crew, with ages and body types that range the spectrum.
The race took us away from the dirt track at the Los Angeles Fairplex and led us through the parking lots and even through a barnyard area complete with eau de cow. Inhaling the smell of cow while running is truly an experience.
Before the event, I had pictured a race where volunteers and onlookers would douse runners with clouds of glow-in-the-dark powder as they cheered us on. It would be glorious and I would feel like an ultraviolet-enhanced version of track and field legend Steve Prefontaine. The reality ended up being a few stations scattered throughout the course so that runners could maybe get hit with a few bursts of powder.
The finish line, where we were promised we would be given a pack of glow powder, was slightly anticlimactic. Actually, there weren’t any signs so we were pretty confused about whether the race was over. Beyond the finish line, however, was a stage where the DJ and a robot were leading the crowd into a post-run frenzy.
Sadly, the robot was merely a man in costume and not a member of the famed French music duo, but the party was still a fun end to an interesting race. Music pumped and here was where the glow powder was  freely distributed. Finally, a chance to glow in the dark like Tron!
For those of you still intrigued by this nationwide trend, the Blacklight Run will return to Los Angeles in 2014. My only advice? Bring your own glow powder and don’t let it get in your mouth. Chalk doesn’t taste good, even if it does come in bright, pretty colors.

The food truck concept often evokes images of greasy, fried foods that aren’t reasonable options for the health-conscious. But Desmond Ng and Bryan Leong’s endeavor, Amazebowls, is far from that stereotype. Their bright purple truck, which students have likely seen at the intersection of Hoover Street and Jefferson Boulevard on Wednesdays and Thursdays, boasts a refreshing innovation: the acai bowl.
Amazing team · Acai bowls have become a popular healthy treat for university students, and USC alumnus Bryan Leong (far right) and Desmond Ng (far left) came up with the idea of opening a food truck. – Courtesy of Amaze Bowls
Leong, a 2013 graduate of the Marshall School of Business, compares acai bowls to sorbets, minus the guilt. Each bowl contains a blend of acai berries topped with granola, bananas, strawberries and coconut shavings.
“It gives you a good boost,” Ng said. “We were catering for a marathon, and I had to wake up at 4 in the morning, and I had a double acai bowl. It got me through the day.”
Acai berries have emerged as the recent craze among fitness enthusiasts, labeled as a “superfood” by many dietitians and experts. Leong explained how the high price of their bowls, which come at nearly six bucks a pop, can be attributed to the rarity of the acai berry — these berries can only be found in the Amazon rainforest.
“We first came across it in Santa Barbara, at a place called Backyard Bowls. There really wasn’t anything like that around here, so we started working on one,” said Ng, Amazebowls’ self-proclaimed “chief chemist.”
As co-founders, Leong and Ng have already faced many roadblocks since starting their business. At first, accruing capital and labor was a challenge. Currently, Leong and another partner are the main investors.
“We received unbelievable support from a lot of people. Whenever we need help, like when we first started doing study nights [at USC], we had no labor,” Leong said. “But all of our friends worked for free, helped chop up the food late at night and helped us figure out how to clean the truck.”
But the ultimate test for the duo wasn’t crafting the perfect recipe or branding their product: It was finding parking space.
“When we wanted to start a food truck business, we thought we could roll up to any area and get a lot of sales. That isn’t the case at all,” Leong said.
Ng added that getting a parking spot with lots of people isn’t necessarily a guarantee of success.
“High traffic areas do not mean high sales. We went to Santa Monica, where there were so many tourists, but none of them stopped by to buy anything,” Ng said.
Moreover, working out of a truck isn’t easy. Like restaurants, trucks must abide by a host of health and safety regulations. They must also park at least 100 feet from a restaurant and owners must constantly feed parking meters to avoid costly fines. And a noticeable dent on the truck’s front bumper, caused by another careless driver, seems like an imperfection on nearly perfect presentation. But to Leong and Ng, such accidents are expected, and it’s more important to roll with the punches than dwell on the setbacks.
Despite the obstacles, their close friendship and sense of trust has helped them persevere. Both co-founders have seen their fair share of adversity, but the two have developed a relationship that plays to each other’s strengths. Ng said he appreciates Leong’s ability to think on his feet, while Leong said he admires Ng’s business skills and passion.
“Desmond’s work ethic is one of the best I’ve ever seen. He keeps everything neat and organized. Finding that is not easy,” Leong said.
Amazebowls has already amassed an impressive social media following. Their energizing bowls currently have all of Los Angeles talking, whether it’s through enthusiastic tweets or comments on the company’s Instagram photos. The Amazebowls team is composed of five other members who contribute to daily operations.
“Since everyone is working on it so much, we take everyone’s input into consideration. It’s more of a team effort,” Ng said.
Leong and Ng also said that their consumers continue to inspire them to better their product.
“After we serve a bowl and they say, ‘This just made my day,’ that definitely keeps us going,” Leong said.
Ng and Leong hope to expand their food truck business to an actual café by next year. But for now, Trojans tired of dining hall pizza and sandwiches can always opt for this tasty and healthy treat, just a brisk walk away on Jefferson and Hoover.
 
Roll on guys!

Jhumpa Lahiri’s new novel, The Lowland, is as mesmerizing as it is tragic. Painting a vivid portrait of a family coping with the loss of its most vibrant and passionate member, the novel still has its flaws. Yet somehow, the work overcomes any setbacks with its ability to create a tangible world.
High point · Though The Lowland suffers slightly from simplistic characters, the novel relies heavily on the characters’ interactions. – Photo courtesy of Random House Publishing
Though Lahiri’s past work dealt more closely with themes of immigration and cultural identity among Indian-Americans, The Lowland focuses more on relationships between the characters themselves. The novel follows the lives of two brothers, Subhash and Udayan, who grew up in Calcutta during the 1960s. Subhash is the quiet and obedient one, and leaves India to pursue a doctorate in marine biology in Rhode Island, whereas Udayan flouts tradition and gets involved in the Naxalite movement, which follows the tenants of Mao’s communism.
The Lowland manages to do the impossible: At times, it feels as if you’re not actually reading at all. Instead, the reader is dropped into a vividly drawn world without any jarring discomfort. The prose is beautifully simplistic and subtle, putting more into spinning a real story than attempting to call attention to itself. Rather than being a flaw, this simplicity creates another dimension to the strained relationships throughout the novel.
One issue, however, is how some of the characters seem to fall into tropes rather than being unique individuals. Though they seem remarkably lifelike, there are a lot of times where there isn’t anything particularly original about a character. Udayan is a fairly typical revolutionary in most of the book, and his daughter Bela fits into the stereotype of the hippie rebel. And while these characters are believable, occasionally their lack of originality makes them less interesting than they might otherwise be.
Though some of the characters might not be particularly original, one of the greatest strengths in The Lowland is the depth and complexity of the relationships between the characters. Lahiri examines cultural obligation between family members and then puts them into impossible circumstances, straining tradition and pushing her characters to find ways around the confining social norms. The relationships between Udayan’s wife Gauri, Subhash and Bela develop and twist so beautifully that the reader is compelled to finish the novel just to learn what happens between all of the characters. The relationship between Gauri and Bela, in particular, is terribly fraught and Lahiri does an excellent job exploring the feelings of a mother who doesn’t love her child, and how that child deals with the pain.
And though the characters’ emptiness is portrayed in an achingly beautiful way, at times it also turns out to be one of its weaknesses. The space created by the death of one of the characters creates a dragging vacuum in the novel. The characters are so alone and so troubled by their process of recovery that it becomes painful to spend time with them, and not in a productive way. The book spans about four generations of this family, and the years pass in the novel in a continuum. The scope of this story is almost too large, as we are introduced to a character or connection that suddenly ends and we find that two years have passed in the interim. Despite the drastic changes in life situations, many of the characters are stagnant and their problems remain similar.
A very interesting component of this book is the inclusion of political philosophy and the exploration of post-independence India. The Naxalite movement is compared to the protests against the Vietnam War in American universities, and separated from them as characters pay a steep price for involvement in such movements. A lot of the struggles between generations are the products of their existing in different incarnations of India, living in a nation that has struggled to find its feet and national identity. The cross-cultural conflicts are also present, as characters struggle to adapt to the United States and are conflicted about returning to Calcutta after leaving. An international divide lends itself to the characters’ isolation throughout the novel, emphasizing the painful absence of one of the main characters.
Though The Lowland has its flaws, Lahiri’s new book is indisputably worth reading. The immensely complex relationships between the characters outweigh the fact that some are slightly stereotypical, and the beauty and ease with which she tells the story glosses over the fact that the scope of the novel might have been slightly too large to prevent it from dragging. At its heart, the story of Subhash, Udayan, Gauri and Bela is a marvelous story.

In light of Banned Books Week, which took place last month, the American Library Association released statistics that showed that the United States’ most censored books came from the young adult and teen fiction genres. According to the ALA, six out of the 10 most banned books are children’s books. Each year, the ALA receives an increasing amount of requests to take books off of their shelves.
Emily McPeek | Daily Trojan
Some individuals who feel the need to censor novels believe that once children immerse themselves in the world of Harry Potter, they automatically turn to witchcraft and demonology as an external form of venting.
Others might even argue that kids these days, mesmerized by the Captain Underpants series, will strip down to nothing but their undergarments, shouting “Tra-la-la!” But most disturbingly, some critics contend that teens are highly influenced by reading Jay Asher’s Thirteen Reasons Why and find themselves driven to a world filled with sex, violence and suicide.
These beliefs, supported by those who believe that shielding children is the best form of education, give way to a faulty slippery-slope argument. Parents might fear that one day their innocent kids will read the Magic Tree House series and before they know it, pick up The Catcher in the Rye and rebel to their full capacity. But the connection between mentalities A and B lacks both middle ground and transition. According to reports by CNN, this ability to recognize the faults in their logic leads beloved books to suddenly be pulled from the shelves, most of the time without the public’s knowledge.
Admittedly, young audiences are malleable, as they are undergoing critical periods of forming their mindset. Shielding kids from specific material, however, is not a sound educational method. What oppressors of “gritty” material, including topics such as racism, homosexuality, and sex, fail to realize is that each story contains a message about the human condition.
Many adults are unable to grasp the ability of kids to decode and differentiate between right and wrong. An introduction to these topics during adolescence actually allows children to process the material for longer periods of time, and exposure to controversial topics ultimately eliminates such a taboo.
This element of attraction to taboo topics translates to the idea that all of the most challenged books reached commercial and critical success to some degree. These celebrated works should be allowed in classrooms and libraries so that young people can have a well-rounded experience.
That being said, the reading selection for children will, of course, have to filter through their parents. But it is the parents’ responsibility to their children to not forbid content because of the subject matter alone. Instead, parents must dive into controversy and explain the gravity of the subject matter to their kids. Though it is crucial to maintain the innocence of children, it is better to explain the repercussions of a certain situation.
 
Danni Wang is a freshman majoring in health and humanity.
But I thought the government knows what’s best for me?
The American Library Association fakes its annual Top 10 List to promote its own interests.  I made a tape recording of one of the awarded authors saying essentially just that.  You are repeating the propaganda.  In truth, no book has been banned in the USA for half a century, and people are allowed to ask schools to reconsider books without being labelled as “censors” and having ALA quietly slip money to locals supporting its view.  And the ALA itself practices censorship, blacklisting, plagiarism and more to promote its message.  
The issue of book challenges in schools is a significant one. Don’t bring yourself down by hitching your start to a political organization with unclean hands like the ALA.
I read banned books.
We live in a world where literature such as the Harry Potter series is denounced as promoting witchcraft. I do not have to align myself with the ALA to want to err on the side of more freedom rather than less.
Agree.  Given ALA tactics, it’s best not to align with such people.

I love Instagram. I love being able to scroll through an uninterrupted flow of beautiful images that let me see snapshots of my friends’ lives. The photos allow me to see so many captured memories that I would have never experienced otherwise. Of course, there is that occasional picture that makes me wonder, “Why would you Instagram that?” But for the most part, I look forward to viewing the compilation of images on my newsfeed.
Unfortunately, my satisfaction with the app could soon dissipate for one simple reason: advertisements.
On Oct. 3, Instagram announced in a blog post that advertisements would eventually be making an appearance in users’ newsfeeds. The post explained that Instagram, as a growing and sustainable business, would soon be posting brand advertisements. These ads, according to Instagram will be disguised as “beautiful, high-quality photos and videos.”
“Seeing photos and videos from brands you don’t follow will be new, so we’ll start slow,” a blogger for Instagram wrote. “Our aim is to make any advertisements you see feel as natural to Instagram as the photos and videos many of you already enjoy from your favorite brands.”
Despite the company’s attempts to reassure users that the Instagram experience will not be damaged, I’m not convinced.
I have a hard time believing that the advertisements will be as seamless and unobtrusive as the blog posts suggests. In fact, I would even go so far as to say that this makes me nervous about the future of Instagram, mostly because of how its parent company, Facebook, has handled its advertising strategy.
When Facebook first started posting ads on the right-hand side panel, the ads were tolerable. They did not interrupt my experience or take me away from the reason I was actually on Facebook — for social interaction. I understand the motives for integrating advertisements: Facebook needed a way to financially benefit from its users, and advertising was the easiest way to do it.
Today, however, advertising on Facebook has made the site an entirely different experience. Ads have become conspicuous, annoying and a little creepy. For example, after considering a pair of shoes on Nordstroms’ website, a picture of those very same shoes popped up in an ad on my newsfeed with a message from Nordstroms to “Go for it!” Rather than convincing me to make the purchase, however, the ad made me feel pressured and uncomfortable. These tailored ads are creepy, weird and way too personal.
Unfortunately, these ads are also profitable. Research firm eMarketer has revealed that spending in the mobile ad space has more than doubled to $8.8 billion in the past year alone.
For Instagram, currently one of the most popular mobile apps, to now open up to advertising, that number will only continue to skyrocket. But at what cost to its users?
Instagram wrote that it will start slow, but we all know that the ads will eventually become more frequent. And these ads could begin to bury the pictures that I actually want to see. The company said that users will have control over what ads they want to see and the ability to hide ads they don’t like, but what if we don’t like ads in general?
I look at Instagram to enjoy the pictures of beautiful, rosy-red sunsets, to view the mouthwatering meals that just look too good to not share. I log on to see moments that can only be explained with a picture, for the images of people and things that I care about. The random advertisements squished awkwardly in between the pictures in my newsfeed will look out of place and harshly interrupt the app’s aesthetic feel. It could even ruin the experience.
For our sake — and Instagram’s — let’s hope that it doesn’t. Let’s hope that we can continue to focus on the pictures that make us happy and try to ignore the ads that probably won’t. If we can do this, perhaps Instagram can remain a positive experience.
