It might not have been under ideal circumstances, but longtime assistant coach Bob Cantu finally got the opportunity to lead the Trojans.
Cantu, the associate head coach who has been with USC (19-14, 10-8) for 10 seasons under five different head coaches, was promoted after Athletic Director Pat Haden suspended head coach Kevin O’Neill for the remainder of the Pac-10 tournament following an incident with an Arizona fan at a local hotel.
Cantu’s first test came against the top-seeded Wildcats (27-6, 14-4) in the semifinal of the Pac-10 tournament on Friday, as the Trojans fell despite a late rally, 67-62.
USC refused to place the blame for the loss on O’Neill.
“[O’Neill] is a big part of our team, but he is not going to go out there and play for us,” said junior forward Nikola Vucevic.
Displaying leadership in his coach’s absence, senior guard Marcus Simmons, a captain, posted a career-high 20 points on 8-of-11 shooting.
“Everyone who knows Marcus knows what he is capable of,” said junior guard Jio Fontan. “He broke out today.”
The team responded well initially under Cantu, who only found out that he was coaching the squad three hours before tipoff. With Arizona deciding to double-team Vucevic, Simmons found himself open, and scored eight points in an 11-0 USC run that gave the Trojans an early 15-9 lead.
By halftime, the Wildcats led 33-28 on 56 percent shooting from beyond the arc.
Arizona led by as many as 12 points in the second half. The Trojans, however, battled back, cutting the Wildcats’ lead to three with 48 seconds left on a three-pointer by Fontan.
After two free throws by Arizona sophomore Derrick Williams, Vucevic converted a lay-up, making the score 65-62 Arizona with 4.7 seconds.
Williams then made two free throws to put the Wildcats up five points, and with no timeouts remaining, USC did not have enough time to make up the deficit.
Vucevic bounced back after only recording seven points and five rebounds in the quarterfinal game against Cal. He had 16 points and 12 rebounds, recording his twenty-first double-double, which leads the Pac-10.
The Trojans’ lack of depth hurt them down the stretch. Arizona had 10 players log seven or more minutes, compared to only six for USC. The Wildcats had 23 points off the bench, while the Trojans had four.
Williams, the Pac-10 Player of the Year, appeared motivated after the Trojans held him to a season-low eight points in the last meeting between the two squads. He finished with 20 points and six rebounds.
Arizona advances to the championship game of the Pac-10 tournament to face the winner of No. 7 seeded Oregon and No. 3 seeded Washington on Saturday at 3:00 p.m. at Staples Center.
The Trojans must now wait until Selection Sunday to find out if they are one of the 68 teams chosen to play in the NCAA tournament, or if they will compete in the NIT tournament.
“We have some great wins,” Cantu said about USC’s tournament resume. “Everybody’s saying we have bad losses, but I personally think that great wins mean more than the bad losses when you look at the big picture.”

The No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team is priming themselves for another busy weekend. No. 15 UC San Diego and No. 7 UC Irvine are slated to be played Friday and Saturday, the second set of back-to-back matches in the last two weeks.
Last weekend, the Trojans (12-1, 12-1) took down No. 2 BYU in consecutive five-set matches with scores of 25-21, 17-25, 25-17, 21-25, 15-12 and 25-18, 23-25, 25-,16, 22-25, 15-10.
USC volleyball legends Dusty Dvorak and Celso Kalache were retired after Saturday’s match. The ceremony as well as the hype of the No. 1 versus No. 2 showdown produced the largest crowd in recent memory, with Saturday’s support squad amassing 3,000 fans.
“This was huge from the program and especially big for the seniors,” said senior setter Riley McKibbin. “We really appreciate the fan support. It’s the best I’ve seen in my four years.”
Senior opposite Murphy Troy led the team in kills for both matches, with 22 kills earned at a .526 clip and 18 kills at a .438 clip in the first and second matches respectively.
Troy was honored as the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Week, the third time this season and the seventh in his career. Troy also recorded his 125th service ace in the past weekend, a new USC rally scoring era record.
“I’m nowhere close to being up there yet, there’s so many greats in our schools history,” Troy said. “Hopefully my career won’t be complete any time soon.”
In the victories, USC exhibited the ability to rally from behind and put a team away.
“We showed a lot of heart and character,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “We keep growing in the face of adversity. In the fifth set on Saturday, we had four stuff blocks. It was huge.”
USC out-blocked BYU 12.5-7 and 13-6 respectively.
Looking to this weekend, the Trojans will face a team that they previously swept in UC San Diego as well as a UC Irvine team they previously defeated.
But USC is not expecting an easy pair of wins.
UC San Diego has the ability to employ both a 5-1 offense with one setter as well as a 6-2 offense, with two setters.
Senior setter Phil Bannan ranks second in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in service aces, one spot ahead of Troy.
“If they can pass and use [6’9” senior middle blocker] Calvin Ross, things could get difficult,” Ferguson said.
UC Irvine has won five of its last six matches and has made drastic changes since the January match, including putting senior setter Anthony Spittle at the controls in place of freshman Daniel Stork. Two-time All-American outside hitter Jordan DuFault has returned as well as starting libero Will Montgomery.
“They play a lot faster with Spittle,” Ferguson said. “We saw a little bit of the quick sets to the outside with BYU’s Taylor Sander, so we got to preface this match a bit.”
Along with the All-American DuFault, the Anteaters feature junior opposite Carson Clark and senior outside hitter Cory Yoder. Clark ranks second in the MPSF in kills and is a two-time All-American.
“DuFault, Yoder, and Clark against Murphy, Tony [Ciarelli], and Tri [Bourne] is the best collection of outside attackers in the country,” Ferguson said. “It’ll be a tough one.”
When asked about the development of the team, McKibbin believes their mindset has played a huge role in their play.
“We haven’t had much personnel change since last year, but there is definitely a difference in how we’re approaching this entire season,” he said. “We’re enjoying the ride, and that’ll lead to our ultimate success.”
[…] USC faces off against UC San Diego and UC Irvine Duke Ho | The Daily Trojan Following No. 1 USC’s victories against No. 2 BYU last week, this preview article discusses how the team was preparing for its home matches against UC San Diego and UC Irvine. The article, though, makes the list because of the reporter’s quote from Trojan outside attacker Murphy Troy about the possibility of the athletics department one day retiring his number. […]

After defeating California on Thursday, 70-56, the Trojans will face Arizona on Friday at 6:10 p.m. in the semifinals of the Pac-10 tournament at Staples Center.
The top-seeded Wildcats (26-6) are led by sophomore forward Derrick Williams, the Pac-10 Player of the Year, who averages 18.8 points and 8.2 rebounds per game.
USC (19-13) and Arizona split the season series, with each team winning on its home court. In the Wildcats’ win, Williams had 20 points, while in the Trojan’s win, he only had eight points.
Coach Sean Miller on the match-up against USC:
“[After] our last loss against USC, a lot of people started to shoot at us like, ‘Arizona’s not that good,’ or ‘what’s wrong with Arizona?’ To me, it’s that USC is a very good team. I look at them as one of the top 35 teams in the country.
Arizona forward Derrick Williams on the match-up against USC:
“It is like a home game for [USC]. They play right down the street, so we have to match their intensity and hopefully we can win.”
Williams on scoring eight points in the loss to USC on February 24:
“I am bound to have one bad game in a season, and I think that was my bad game. Not everybody’s going to play perfectly. That was that game, and I’m over that game.”
Miller on USC’s big men:
“Vucevic and Stepheson are very unique. Very seldom do you have two players that play that much together and have that size physically. They seem to have really gotten into a rhythm on offense where they find each other.
“Defensively, they are so big that the game is difficult around the basket. Their coach does an excellent job of putting them in position defensively to really change the game. They are one of the best defensive teams that plays college basketball.”
Miller on USC coach Kevin O’Neill’s comments about Williams being protected by the officials:
“Tomorrow’s game is about USC and Arizona. Nobody her is going to answer to the question about the officials or something that was said. I think that period of time is over.”

After an internal investigation into the alleged confrontation Thursday night between USC coach Kevin O’Neill, his wife Roberta and University of Arizona booster Paul Weitman, USC athletic director Pat Haden announced Friday afternoon that O’Neill would be suspended for the rest of the Pac-10 tournament effective immediately.
“I have talked to Coach Kevin O’Neill and expressed my disappointment in his involvement in an incident last night and which he and his engaged in an argument with a support of another school,” Haden said in a statement. “We have met with various parties who have knowledge of the incident. Based on the information we have gathered, I am immediately suspending Coach O’Neill for the balance of the Pac-10 Tournament and have also set forth additional discipline that will remain private.”
USC returns to the Staples Center floor tonight at 6 p.m. for their semifinal matchup with O’Neill’s former team, No.15 Arizona.
If the Trojans pull off the upset they would only have one more tournament game against either Washington or Oregon tomorrow afternoon in the tournament final.
“I understand my behavior as the leader of our team was unacceptable. I used poor judgment and put my team and USC in a bad light. I regret that I have let them down,” O’Neill said in response to his suspension. “I respect and accept the disciplinary actions imposed on me by USC. It is something that I will have to live with. I look forward to learning from this, moving forward and coaching the Trojans well into the future.”
Head assistant coach Bob Cantu will assume O’Neill’s coaching duties for the remainder of the tournament.
In two years as the Trojans’ coach, O’Neill is 35-27.

According to PointGuardU.com, an Arizona-centric website, USC coach Kevin O’Neill and his wife, Roberta, were involved in a heated altercation with university donor Paul Weitman inside the JW Marriott in downtown Los Angeles hours just after the Trojans’ 70-56 quarterfinal win over California in the Pac-10 tournament.
KVOA.com in Tucson reports the O’Neills had to be escorted off hotel property after Roberta struck a long-time Arizona fan.
The station says the nature of the confrontation is unknown at this time and would not confirm whether the long-time fan was in fact Weitman.
“We have received some information about an incident involving coach Kevin O’Neill, his wife and a fan from another school that occurred following our men’s basketball game today,” USC athletic director Pat Haden said in a statement last night. “We are looking into this and gathering facts. We will determine what appropriate action is necessary.
O’Neill served as the Wildcats’ coach on an interim basis during the 2007-2008 season while Lute Olson took a leave of absence from the team.
It was long believed he would succeed Olson in Tucson, Ariz., but the university failed to drop his interim tag and fired him after just one season.
Tonight’s semifinal between the Trojans and No. 15 Arizona is set to begin at 6 p.m. at Staples Center.
Whether O’Neill will be on the USC sideline for tonight’s game remains unclear, but he did issue an apology during a phone interview with Yahoo! Sports.
“I apologize to the university,” he said. “The last thing I’d ever want to do is cause anyone any embarrassment. I’m confident our team won’t let this become a distraction.”
O’Neill went on to admit he had had a “few drinks” but claims initial reports about the incident are “grossly inaccurate.”
