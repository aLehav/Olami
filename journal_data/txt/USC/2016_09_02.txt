Redshirt sophomore defensive end Don Hill was suspended and sent home a day before USC’s season opener against Alabama in Dallas for a “violation of team rules,” according to a USC spokesperson.
Hill was mentioned in a TMZ report on Thursday detailed sophomore linebacker Osa Masina’s multiple alleged sexual assaults. TMZ, which obtained a copy of a search warrant, reported that Hill allegedly participated in raping a woman at Hill’s off-campus apartment on July 14.
Masina was also suspended for the Alabama game, though the University allowed him to practice with the team in the week leading up to the game. He is also being reportedly investigated for another alleged sexual assault in Utah on July 26.
Hill has been disciplined before for several incidents. Following a DUI in Boise, Idaho in 2015, he was suspended for spring camp. Hill also did not participate in spring camp before this season due to an undisclosed violation of team rules.
Neither Masina nor Hill have been charged with a crime.
USC begins its season against Alabama on Saturday.

The first week of classes are over and you might still be nursing a bad hangover after all the LITivities you attended over the weekend, but hold off on sippin’ another until after you’ve read the rest of this blog. 
Whether you’re a freshman or a senior, you have to have noticed all the construction going on around campus. We aren’t known as the “University of Summer Construction” for nothing. It seems like every year I come back to school there’s a new building, another road closure, and a different fountain being built. As a senior, I have seen my fair share of changes over the past three years, having lived both on and off campus.
So let’s talk about some of the things I’m not sad to see go, the ones I will miss, and the ones I wish I was going to be around for.
If you’ve ever seen a movie here, I’m sure you starting shaking your head and reminiscing on what a mistake that was. I saw two movies here my freshman year, and while the prices were low, the cockroach count was high. It definitely beats paying almost $20.00 for a movie ticket at LA Live, but 10/10 would not recommend to a friend. 
I’ve never been the type of person to only eat organic foods, mainly because I don’t feel the need to spend all of my coins on kale ice cream or overpriced eggs to make a trendy emu omelet (yes, you can actually buy these at your local Whole Foods). Superior was the “kween” of off-brand cereal choices, conchas, and a very convenient place to get supplies for your next party. But that’s about all it was good for, so it is with little sadness that I say “goodbye” to it and “hello” to Trader Joe’s – coming soon to a UV near you. *Beyoncé voice*  Let me upgrade you.
If you’re anything like me, this change was more than welcomed. Although we all love a good fast food taco (or do we?), we have plenty of better options at Taco Bell or Chipotle down the street. Most of us have probably erased the memory of this Del Taco ever existing now that we get our coffee fix from Starbucks instead. I very much approve and I will continue to sip on my venti Strawberry Acai with light ice and a splash of lemonade on the daily. 
Let me start by saying I totally understand why this policy is being implemented, but a big part of me still asks, “Why?” I’ve had many discussions with my friends who are in sororities about how they will have to retire their cute fanny packs and essentially replace them with a Ziploc bag on a belt – and that ain’t cute. They don’t want you to be poppin’ at the football games. Congratulations, you played yourself, USC. 
If you were excited to pregame an adventure around campus complete with jumping into all thirty of USC’s fountains, you can pack up those swim trunks and put away the tequila because the fountains are now closed for business. After the last fountain run resulted in a broken arm and a belligerent altercation with DPS, the long-held tradition was laid to rest. I guess we’ll just have to hit up the 9-0 like everyone else.
We will pour one out for all the other small changes, such as Chanos renaming itself as El Huero. We’ve all done our Spanish interview projects here, and if you have any respect for the establishment, you will always recognize it by its OG name. These many changes weren’t the first and they most certainly won’t be the last around USC.

When I initially told people I was going to study abroad in Morocco for 4 months, many of them were unaware of what Morocco actually was. Some thought it was a city in Europe or the Middle East until I mentioned that the famous American film Casablanca took place in Casablanca, Morocco. 
Colonized by the French and Spanish and once a French protectorate, The Kingdom of Morocco is a North African country characterized by Berber, Arab and European influences. It is a mixture of ancient and modern languages and traditions in Arabic, French, Darija, Spanish and other colloquial dialects.

My first week in Rabat, the capital, consisted of being yelled and spit on by Moroccan taxi drivers, eating couscous with my welcoming Moroccan host family, swimming in the Atlantic Ocean, walking inside the third largest mosque in Africa, learning colloquial Moroccan slang words and more.

En route to Morocco from Los Angeles, I desperately tried to not have preconceived notions about the food, culture, language or people of Morocco. I arrived with an open mind and heart and let Morocco do it’s magic.
However, during my first week here, I am still experiencing a mix of the honeymoon stage and a culture shock simultaneously. It’s a lot to digest.

When you see others travel, often there is a romanticized image of the country and its people. These images do exist in every country, but there is another side to it when you are actually living in the country for an extended period. I didn’t expect street harassment by men toward females to be a prevalent problem until I actually experienced it myself; I didn’t realize how gender inequality is dominant in many aspects of society; and I also didn’t realize how hospitable Moroccan families were, or that long drawn greetings and respect are pivotal in establishing positive relationships.
When exploring a new country, even the most mundane activities, such as walking to the grocery store to buy water becomes an exciting adventure. I see new people around the store every day and I speak to the cashier in Darija, the main colloquial tongue.
As an international relations major with a focus on the Middle East and North Africa, my main goal is to improve my Arabic speaking, writing, and reading skills. I also wish to learn more about the sociopolitical climate of Rabat and neighboring cities, multiculturalism and human rights challenges shaping the Arab world—specifically in terms of authoritarian rule, democratic transition, economic liberalization and Islamic movements.
My first week of classes are underway and I have already learned so much about the history of the Maghreb (or North African region) and am excited to learn more.
I could not have picked a better place to start my senior year of college.
