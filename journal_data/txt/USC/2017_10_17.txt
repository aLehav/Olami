Week 6 of the NFL season proved that a fine line between winning and losing extends to all 32 teams, regardless of current momentum. It also gave reason to believe many squads can compete at similar levels until winter comes. 
Granted, since we’re not yet at the regular season’s halfway point, we don’t know how those games in November and December — the ones that matter the most — will pan out. But the slate of results this week tells me that unpredictability might be rampant when the year 2017 nears its conclusion.
The Atlanta Falcons lost to the Miami Dolphins 20-17, the Chargers downed Oakland 17-16, and the Steelers beat the Kansas City Chiefs 19-13 to spoil Andy Reid’s undefeated record. Most notably, the Denver Broncos’ run defense broke down in a surprising 23-10 loss to the injury-depleted New York Giants. With the Falcons, Chiefs and Broncos all falling short, another Super Bowl choice, the New England Patriots, barely escaped MetLife Stadium with a 24-17 victory over the New York Jets, following a controversial touchdown reversal that took 6 points away from the Jets.
While the outcomes of these games were especially intriguing, this past week’s biggest story might be the loss of a Super Bowl contender’s one-of-a-kind quarterback, as Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers left the game against the Minnesota Vikings. His broken collarbone could keep him out for the rest of the year. In the NFC North, the Vikings (4-2) and Detroit Lions (3-3) surely feel better about the opportunity to overcome the Rodgers-less Packers.
Former USC head coach Steve Sarkisian, now Dan Quinn’s offensive coordinator, is one of the men to blame for the Falcons’ offensive situations not working out. The Falcons will travel to Gillette Stadium next week to take on the Patriots in a Super Bowl LI rematch, and both sides aren’t performing up to their previously high standards. Still, the Falcons have that explosive ability, and plenty of blueprints exist for Sarkisian to understand how to attack this lowly Patriots defense.
Extra points being missed can completely alter the outlook of contests, as was demonstrated when Raiders kicker Giorgio Tavecchio drilled his attempt off target in the fourth quarter. Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers then drove his team down the field for the game-winning field goal. Rivers finally had luck on his side, and Derek Carr returned to the field with a lackluster, two-interception performance. You’d think with Carr at the helm, the Raiders would be able to emerge victorious, but then again, it’s difficult to judge how effective he can be struggling through injury issues.
Rivers, meanwhile, appears to have a ton of fight in him as he nears the end of his career. With the win against the Raiders, both Rivers and Co. and Jack Del Rio’s crew have 2-4 records. The odds are probably more in the favor of the Raiders pulling out a playoff appearance, but if the Chargers are able to get running back Melvin Gordon going, I’m not counting the Bolts out. Ingram had 150 rushing and receiving yards versus Oakland. Chargers fans should also be excited for the potential of wide receiver Mike Williams after seeing him finally debut. Rivers could use a guy with that sort of size and speed, especially in crucial third-down situations that seem to destroy the Chargers at points.
For the Rams, their hype train becomes more real with their 27-17 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Rams haven’t been 4-2 in 11 years and haven’t begun the year 3-0 on the road since 2001. If you were to tell me this summer Jared Goff would be as stable as he is now, I wouldn’t believe it. That has to speak to Goff’s maturation and the quality of the new head coach Sean McVay, a young gun from the Washington Redskins. Goff has thrown only three interceptions in his six starts this year, compared to his seven interceptions in seven starts in 2016. Even when Goff has pedestrian numbers, as he did against the Jaguars, the Rams find ways to get the job done. This time, it was on special teams and defense. Pharoh Cooper returned the opening kickoff 103 yards, and Malcolm Brown took a blocked punt to the house. Defensive coordinator Wade Phillips has an unit that forces turnovers at the right instances. Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles, picked off by Nickell Robey-Coleman minutes into the fourth quarter, learned the hard way.
Is this merely an opportunistic team early on in 2017 or do the surprising performances signal the Rams actually have a shot in the NFC? I strongly believe the Rams have chance within their division, the NFC West. The 49ers look like the bottom feeder, and the Cardinals, despite their strong play against the Buccaneers this past weekend, have displayed bouts of inconsistency. Mark you calendars for December 17, when the Rams face the Seahawks for the second time. That game may decide the division champion.

While some people spent the aftermath of Donald Trump’s presidential victory watching the news, crying or cheering, others were glued to political forums, discussing and debating what having Trump as our president would mean. 
One of these forum-crawlers was Gibson Morales, an alumnus who graduated from USC in 2011 and majored in psychology. Morales classifies himself as an “authorpreneur,” having written various young adult science fiction novels such as The Deadliest Earthling and The Boy Who Wields Thunder. Yet, as a writer constantly on the prowl for new ways to entertain, Morales found a way to transform his time discussing politics with friends into “Talking Trump: A Presidential Party Game.”
The card game is simple: Players are asked to answer a “conversation starter” question using a randomly drawn Trump quote. The catch is that the other players should not recognize that a Trump quote is being used. To make matters more challenging, certain quotes have interchangeable words so as not to give the player away; for instance, “Nobody knew [subject] could be so complicated.” When a player uses the quote and does not get recognized, they get a point. When the deck of quote cards or question cards runs out, the player with the most points wins.
The idea came to Morales amid political discussions with friends that oscillated between genuine concern and parody. 
“Among my friends, we’d often use some of Trump’s debate quotes as jokes to satirize him,” Morales said. “I noticed the same thing on political websites; people would reference his quotes with a word changed or a twist to it to make it more relevant to the topic.” 
The game is meant to not only exemplify our generation’s approach to humor — that is, the metamorphosis of news into entertainment — but also to promote political awareness in social settings. Trump’s quotes, like politics itself, now linger at parties like an issue waiting to be addressed, or a joke waiting to be told. 
Though the options were vast and seemingly never-ending, Morales opted for quotes that were both outrageous and colloquially used, reminding players and political enthusiasts alike that there is, in fact, humor in everything. However, the hilarity of the game comes from its relevance. What one might see on the news today could make it into a future edition of “Talking Trump.”
“The nice thing about a card game is that there’s always room for expansion,” Morales said. 
The two most recent expansions are titled “Trumplandia” and “Deplorable Rising,” bringing in the vernacular that some Trump supporters use. Like the vocabulary surrounding Trump’s presidency, “Talking Trump” itself is also constantly expanding. 
“If I discover a great quote I missed, I can always include it in a later expansion,” Morales said.
Though Morales’s favorite Trump quote in the game is based off the classic “Jeb is a mess,” many other quotes are yet to come.

As a part of this year’s Red Bull Music Academy Festival, director and screenwriter Edgar Wright gave a talk on the importance of music in film at the Vista Theatre on Monday night. He elaborated on the influence of music on his directing career just days after the DVD release of his most recent film, Baby Driver.
Wright cited his parents’ favorite filmmakers as vital to his creative upbringing, specifically choreographer Busby Berkeley and directors Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick. While he believes that large-scale, choreographed scenes are extinct in today’s films, he found the detail evident in Berkeley’s big-budget productions inspirational. 
He discussed discovering new music for the soundtrack to his British sitcom Spaced. After filming the episodes, he would go to superstores to find old CDs that appeared to have appropriate songs. He stated that for the series’ original run, he would add music to the finished scenes. This changed in the series’ second run as he received more creative control with the success of the first series’ soundtrack. 
“Nobody was really telling me what to do or how to do it,” Wright said. “It’s one of those things where you don’t realize how lucky you are until later, that you were sort of left alone.” 
 Wright also elaborated on his career as a music video director. He said that most of his videos aired before his first high-budget film, Shaun of the Dead. Ironically, he believes his videos improved as budgets tightened. Directing music videos, he explained, helped him understand the weight of well-placed audio-visual effects.
Wright then screened a clip of a video he shot in 2003 for a record called “Blue Song” by Manchester-based electronic group Mint Royale. The video depicts a getaway driver jamming to the song alone in his car as his crew robs a bank. The concept for this sequence, as it turns out, provided the inspiration for Baby Driver’s famous opening scene. Music videos also provided him with a platform to test out his ideas for film, he elaborated. 
“I really do [videos] to try something out,” Wright said. “If there’s something I haven’t done, you basically come up with a treatment basis on something you would like to do.” 
A bar fight scene in Shaun of the Dead was the first time Wright had music for a scene playing on-set during shooting so actors could understand the aesthetic he was trying to evoke in a certain scene. Using Queen’s “Don’t Stop Me Now,” Wright used the song’s bouncy imagery to capture the film’s comedic horror genre.
Wright also cited An American Werewolf in London’s moon-themed soundtrack for helping him understand how common themes in a film’s score can still evoke a variety of emotions. The special effects and makeup in the film were so strong that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences created the category for Best Makeup for the film in 1981.
For the celebrated music in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Wright enlisted producer Nigel Godrich of Beck and Radiohead fame. Godrich’s extensive network of studio musicians provided the film with award-winning scoring. As extensive as Godrich’s career is, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World remains Godrich’s only film score to date.
The talk confirmed Wright’s status as a visionary in the new generation of directors who understand the weight of a film’s soundtrack. The rise of music videos in the 1980s was often marked by directors’ efforts to make videos feel like individual films. A similar phenomenon is being observed decades later as directors are transforming their films into music videos. If the seamless soundtracking of Baby Driver and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is any indication, Wright’s possibilities in this area are limitless.

Last weekend, my friend invited me to go shopping with her. And though I readily agreed at the time, once I was faced with the flashy fluorescence of Forever 21, she noticed that, rather than rifling through the racks, I was instead blinking in bemusement and cataloguing exits and escape routes. 
“Aren’t you going to get anything?” she asked.
“I buy most of my clothes from online thrift stores,” I informed her in that smug, patronizing holier-than-thou manner adopted by anyone who has decided to don an exclusively secondhand wardrobe after reading an expose on the exploitative relationship between fast fashion and developing countries. 
Just kidding; I’m not that altruistic. I curate an unconventional wardrobe, replete with wacky, look-at-me statement pieces, because I want to stand out from the Kanken-toting, Stan Smith-sporting crowd. Some of my favorite threads: a punchinello-embroidered Bob Mackie sweater; fishnets juxtaposed against juvenile Winnie-the-Pooh overalls; a t-shirt with “NUDES” emblazoned across the front. Tellingly, they are all garments that have garnered a “What are you wearing?” response.
There is undoubtedly a performative aspect to my showy ensembles. I am unduly aware of people’s eyes sliding over me as I saunter through campus, relishing in the prolonged stares and double takes cast my way. You’d think someone attired in such attention-grabbing apparel would love being in the limelight, but in fact, the opposite is true. My clothes are at odds with my personality, which is, in actuality, very shy and attention-averse. 
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Call me vain, shallow, image-obsessed — and I’d be inclined to agree with you. Most of my disposable income is swallowed up by increasingly unusual (and expensive) clothing from increasingly obscure sources. Certainly, the time I spend in the morning agonizing over mes vêtements could be better devoted to curing cancer, ending world hunger or just catching a little more shut-eye. 
But I would argue that getting dressed in the morning is as valid a form of self-expression as any other art form. Finding new media for making a creative statement, whether through dance, literature, or art, has always been a necessity for me, likely because of how quiet I am. When the neurons relaying messages between my brain and mouth short-circuit and the words get lodged in my throat like a fish bone, I’m forced to employ some other method of communication, of asserting myself and my presence. 
I am afraid that if I wear jeans and a t-shirt, I would vanish completely, fade into the drywall until all that’s left is a pair of glasses. That people would skim over me, discount me, believe that I don’t have anything to say or offer, even though nothing could be further from the truth. I myself lack the audacity to demand your attention, so my clothes do the job for me; but once I have it, I can take it from there.

It would be fair to ask “How do we stop this from continually happening?” Short of finding a way to fundamentally transform human nature, I’m not sure it’s possible. Wherever there are great concentrations of wealth, power and prestige —whether in governments, corporations, universities, churches or other institutions — there will always be tantalizing opportunities for abuse. And people, being as they are, will take them.
The corruption of academic administrators, a phenomenon USC has become all too familiar with in recent months, points to a bigger issue than simply poor character among individuals. It also highlights the endless growth of the modern university’s wealth, power and prestige, and the consolidation of its position atop American society, in its role as the primary determinant of middle-and upper-class status. Just as consolidation and dominance has led to corruption and decadence in other institutions — note the high-level scandals in California’s government over the last decade, or the near-criminal activities that caused the 2008 financial crisis — academia’s domination of its own sector has measurable moral consequences as well.
How do we fix this? The most obvious answers, to take a page out of the progressive playbook of the early 20th century, are regulation and competition. Back then, when confronted with the great industrial, transportation and energy monopolies of the day, progressive reformers divided into two factions with different answers. Some argued that the empowering of government institutions to regulate and balance the great trusts and consolidated corporations would keep those institutions operating efficiently and in the public interest. Others argued that the great trusts, banks and businesses would need to be fully broken up, with competition restored to the formerly consolidated sectors. Ultimately, these approaches would be combined into the New Deal in the 1930s, when large banks were indeed broken up, while most industries were regulated by new bureaucracies.
In the 21st century’s “gilded age” of higher education, it seems to me that some elements of both approaches would be useful.
For better or for worse, the university system isn’t going anywhere, and it won’t be opened up to any significant competition that can truly offer the same services any time soon. There are many reasons for this, but the chief one is that higher education is a guild rather than a business. Its practice and teaching requires years or even decades of experience and cultivation, and is not easily tradeable or purchasable. (For this reason, the notions that we could “fix” higher educational inequity either by opening it to a free market or by universal provision by the government have a limited view of what education really is.)
But the university system does hold a monopoly in at least one way that it need not — and that is that, in the current post-GI Bill context, a university education is the only sure ticket to the kinds of high-skill or high-pay jobs that allow middle-class living, and which correspondingly grant one middle-class social status or higher. So more and more students who otherwise might not consider four-year university educations get them anyway, and continue to feed the higher education beast with more and more dollars every year.
There are very clear alternatives to this universal university model. Trade and technical schools and community colleges have been popular among lower-income Americans for a long time, and might be attractive for even more if they weren’t associated with lower prestige than the university system. So the development of a political economy with multiple, non-university paths to middle-class status and prestige, where apprenticeships, community colleges, trade schools and national service programs stood alongside university education in affording wealth and dignity to more and more Americans across the income spectrum — this would be the best way to undercut the monopoly of the university system in America today.
This, coupled with better management from the U.S. Department of Education, the state-level education bureaus and various national accrediting associations, could probably help to streamline the reforms of higher education to make it nimbler for the 21st century and remove its more parasitic and predatory aspects in the American social system.
This is all only indirectly related to the topic at hand, the corruption within academia. But as long as the modern university stands unchallenged at the top of the American social system, the opportunities for administrative bloat and individual corruption will go unchecked. Cutting the university down a notch might humble it.

Another top University administrator is out at USC. David Carrera, USC’s vice president of advancement and health sciences development, is no longer working at USC while in the midst of an investigation into sexual harassment toward female colleagues. 
If that sounds familiar, it’s because it is. Carrera is just the latest USC employee being investigated for wrongdoing. He follows former Keck School of Medicine Dean Rohit Varma, who abruptly resigned just a few days earlier in anticipation of a Los Angeles Times story about a complaint made 15 years ago by a female colleague. “USC formally disciplined the dean, Dr. Rohit Varma, in 2003 following allegations that he sexually harassed the young researcher while he was a junior professor supervising her work,” the Times said.
Varma follows his Keck predecessor Carmen Puliafito, who was removed from campus after yet another Los Angeles Times investigation detailed his drug use while serving as dean. And those aren’t the only USC employees under fire. Assistant basketball coach Tony Bland was arrested late last month on federal charges related to bribery. 
What has become clear to students is that there is a systemic lack of foresight and accountability.
“It simply cannot be overstated: this University will not tolerate sexual misconduct in any form, whether it is sexual violence, abuse, stalking, intimate partner violence, harassment, or discrimination,” Provost Michael Quick said in a memo to USC students in September — just a month before revelations about both Carrera and Varma came out.
If Quick were sincere about the University’s commitment to zero tolerance of sexual harassment, why was Varma promoted to dean under his tenure? Though it cannot be said whether a review of personnel complaints took place before Varma’s promotion, Quick should have known about the complaint, and thus not promoted Varma to the deanship. It would seem as though, at the very least, looking into Varma’s background would have given Quick pause in appointing him as Puliafito’s successor. But in the event that USC officials were aware of the complaint, it appears that as far as University administrators were concerned, his censure in 2003 did not impede his eventual upward progress at the University.
And if Quick meant what he said, then why was Puliafito allowed to stay on faculty and treat patients even after he resigned from his deanship, a week and a half after a witness to the overdose of Puliafito’s companion made a six-minute call to President C. L. Max Nikias’ office; a crisis management specialist representing USC, Charles Sipkins, told the Times that an anonymous call did reach the president’s office, but that it never reached senior administrators.  If this account is accurate, then why wasn’t there a system in place to pass on phone calls of this nature? And why did USC not begin its investigation into Carrera until after the Los Angeles Times published its Puliafito investigation, even though it had already received five complaints about him in a single year?
Put simply, USC’s administration has lost the trust of its students. It continues to power a serious disconnect between its promises and its actions.
After Varma’s resignation, Quick sent a memo to USC’s medical community, promising to “strengthen and improve our culture” by hiring a new vice provost to provide leadership training to senior executives and creating an oversight office. It feels like too little, too late. And is leadership training for senior executives really necessary? Shouldn’t USC be hiring people who don’t sexually harass employees or students, indulge in copious drug use?
The private university system requires students to trust the University to self-regulate. Clearly, the University has lost this privilege. If it were not for the Los Angeles Times’ dogged investigations into USC faculty, Carrera, Puliafito and Varma might still be in senior leadership roles at the University. 
The gateway to increasing accountability, especially when it comes to employees facing sexual harassment investigations, is through Title IX. One way for this to manifest could be a requirement for universities to report sexual misconduct complaints to the Department of Education. But implementation should be careful; colleges might make it more difficult for faculty or students to report sexual misconduct complaints, so that those complaints are not logged with the federal government. Therefore, the Title IX complaint process, which is already mandated, should be monitored to ensure its efficacy. 
Given the ideology of the current presidential administration, expanding Title IX regulations isn’t likely; President Donald Trump probably doesn’t consider expanding sexual misconduct protections a priority. But elite universities have become machines of concentrated power, and the recent string of scandals at USC demonstrates that they require government regulation — like the FBI investigation that led to Bland’s arrest — in order to hire ethical faculty and administrators. It seems like such a small ask — for the staff of the University to refrain from sexual misconduct, avoid illegal drug use and resist bribery. Yet, here we are.

Welcome to Sex and the Campus, a weekly column where I discuss all things love and relationships. It should be noted that I do not claim to be any kind of expert in either area. Dating is hard, but hopefully reading this column won’t be. 
If you have any burning questions about love and relationships, or just have a good dating horror story to share feel free to send them to dailytrojanblogs@gmail.com 
This week we’re talking about fighting fair. All relationships come with arguments, but we need to learn to do it better…
All is fair in love in war, right? Wrong. Love makes us do crazy things, yes, but we are always held responsible for those actions eventually. Every relationship you have will come with disagreements — whether it’s between you and your parents, your friends or even your significant other. It’s proven, however, that how we “fight” will directly impact the health of our relationship. If you’re constantly calling each other names or going for the low blow, don’t you think that could eventually change how you see each other?
Recently I had an argument with my boyfriend. We were both stressed, life was kicking us in the butt, and then we turned on each other. The thing is, though, once something is said — or in this case, texted — you can’t take it back. I try to remember that whenever my S/O is royally pissing me off, but sometimes I forget. But I do see the difference after I’ve said something uncalled for and hurtful, and I certainly feel it when it happens to me. 
No one wants their insecurities brought up in the middle of an extremely vulnerable moment with someone close to you. Most of the time the person standing across from you that’s receiving your wrath isn’t even the one responsible for it. I know how it is when life is stressful, and then your friend/parent/significant other just does that one little quirk of theirs, but for some reason this time it just sets you off. That’s called using someone as your emotional punching bag, and it’s not fair. 
This generation has been stunted in a lot of ways, but none of them are more apparent than in our emotional immaturity. Most young adults have no idea how to healthily process their emotions, or how to cope with everyday life stressors. When something comes along and throws us off our game, we freak out. It’s taking us longer to grow up, and because of this we’re establishing really unhealthy habits in our relationships. 
In order to have a lasting connection, we have to establish healthy ways of communicating. One of the areas that is often overlooked is how we argue. Personally, I don’t believe every disagreement has to end up in a fight. Most of the time if we were openly communicating throughout the relationship about things that bother us when they first appear, we wouldn’t just blow up all of a sudden. Sometimes, though, arguments are just inevitable. Tensions run high, and all you want is to be right — but for the sake of the relationship, we have to calm down and do it right. 
The first thing we have to realize is that there is a real, living human being across from us. They are someone who’s close to you, they care about you, and you care about them. They have real feelings that could get hurt. If you think about that, you’re less inclined to say things that you know will hurt them. Second, you need to assess the situation. Is this argument really about something they did, or could there be some underlying reason why you’re so upset? If it’s the former, remember to take a breath and then calmly explain what it is that they did that upset you, and why. If it’s the latter, then you need to do a little soul-searching to see if this is really worth bringing up. Explain to your partner that you’re under a lot of stress so it’s not their fault you’re so upset, and then explain to them what they did that upset you. 
Try to stay away from accusations, raising your voice, low blows and leaving without a word. Remember, you care about this person — you may even love them — so put yourself in their place; if they were upset with you about the same thing, how would you want to be approached? 
Arguments are a normal part of every relationship, but they don’t have to be so scary. If done right, they can be a part of healthy ongoing communication. If done wrong, however, they can really end in some hurt feelings.
If you feel like you may not have the emotional coping skills you should, maybe check out therapy. I go every week, and will always advocate for it; everyone should see a therapist at least once, in my book. If you feel that your relationship is becoming unhealthy or abusive, please reach out to a close friend (or even to me), or the RSVP office here at USC. 
Keep it healthy, ’SC.

We’re approaching those days in the semester where there’s just too much to do and too little time. Each day has so much for me to experience, and sometimes, I feel like I don’t have the capacity to absorb it all.
For example, college is so fun and I’m learning so much, but every minute I realize there’s more to learn. Every minute I realize that there just aren’t enough minutes. I get preoccupied with one activity, then the next activity comes along too soon. I’m in college to see as many colors in this world as possible, whether it’s through nature or clothing, but isn’t it unfortunate to know that the rainbow exists and we just can’t see it all? 
Los Angeles is known for an overwhelming sensory overload, but wow — there are just too many songs to sing and views to see, every day. When I’m asking to take a picture of someone’s outfit, I miss another. The people of Los Angeles dress quite vibrantly. The whole fashion reporting deal is a lot more difficult when everyone is eye-catching.
I see great views everywhere I go. Outfits are no different. I’ve kept busy but every time I turn my head, there’s another cool skirt, a one-of-a-kind t-shirt, or a new gadget accessory. A lot caught my eye these past few weeks, but I’m afraid I couldn’t capture all of it for you.  So here are the ones I had the courage to approach and ask to take a picture of.
Last weekend I went to the Solange concert at the Hollywood Bowl. The fans were dressed as decadently as the show. Everyone looked intentional with their clothing: the whole stadium had certainly planned for their Sunday evening concert outfit. Every person was eye-catching, but here are the few I stopped for.

I interrupted Christopher and Alejandro’s conversation just so I could ask about Christopher’s light-up bag. I asked if it was handmade. The reply? “Believe it or not, Forever21. I know, right?“

I’m always floored when I go to functions like these. I felt as if all of L.A. was at the Hollywood Bowl that night, and there was a raw sense of community. We were all there to enjoy the show, sharing the same evening purpose, yet we all looked so different. The range of cuts and patterns and shapes and colors reflected every age, every taste, everywhere. The Hollywood Bowl was a cross-section of the whole city.
If I could, I would have taken pictures of everyone — that’s the only honest way that this whole fashion-reporting, social-experimenting thing can work. It’s a bit sad that I can only collect the shiniest things I see, but that just means our world is so rich with color and excitement that we have to be pickier. I hope when it comes to your laundry and life, you can appreciate the rainbow we wear and breathe and see every day.
Who knew that this desert city could glow so bright? I’ve learned that light really is a composite of all the colors we can experience.

American college campuses have become political battlegrounds, and students are taking up arms. 
An annual UCLA survey shows that political engagement has reached numbers unparalleled since the study started in 1966 — the era of student protests against apartheid and the Vietnam War.
To many, it feels as if political hostilities in the face of the 2016 presidential election have permeated every aspect of life and made it difficult to converse about everyday issues without inadvertently inciting an argument. Students are tiptoeing around each other as national political headlines — each more scandalous than the one before — add fuel to a hungry fire, rendering the national climate at once tired, sensitive and dangerously mercurial. If one thing is certain, though, it is that Donald Trump’s presidency has transcended party politics and heightened tensions on American college campuses.
Ironically, the middle ground has become the most controversial place to tread.
Trump’s leadership has mobilized both opposition from the left, which argues his ascendancy validates conservative vitriol, and support from the right, which welcomes his blatant disregard for political correctness. In turn, discord over First Amendment rights has descended into violence as frustration escalates on both ends. 
Ironically, the middle ground has become the most controversial place to tread. Student activists are demanding to see change on campus in the form of improved university policy and administration, but their demands often seek to limit freedom of expression rather than encourage it.
The inevitable consequence is that college students are fed up with talking about politics. And as acute political exhaustion mounts, intolerance for the exchange of ideas at American universities grows.
For progressives, the ugly truth about Trump’s presidency is that he stands for more than just the Republican party. A Suffolk Post survey revealed 76 percent of Democrats consider him a racist. In their eyes, he stands for racism, sexism and homophobia, for a multitude of -isms and for centuries of social and systemic oppression.
The idea of fighting over nuances as fleeting as a word or a look can feel insignificant when the safety, well-being and fundamental rights of many people are hanging in the balance. But frustration toward the prospect of censoring dialogue only provides further evidence for why minority groups advocate for it on campus…
In response to his election victory, student protesters have organized to demand their universities right what they deem historical wrongs — encompassing anything and everything from faculty diversity to public apologies. Their efforts have been fruitful, too. Last year, activists chased out the dean of students at the nearby Claremont McKenna College; the president and chancellor at the University of Missouri stepped down following the walkout of the football team; students have called for colleges to establish safe spaces and trigger warnings to avoid controversial discourse; micro-aggressions, subtle but offensive interactions targeting members of marginalized groups, are now highlighted in many university policies (including this University’s) as unacceptable behavior.
The idea of fighting over nuances as fleeting as a word or a look can feel insignificant when the safety, wellbeing and fundamental rights of many people are hanging in the balance. But frustration toward the prospect of censoring dialogue only provides further evidence for why minority groups advocate for it on campus: Members of marginalized groups constantly feel the need to censor themselves and adapt accordingly as not to fit into negative stereotypes. They are used to — and tired of — maneuvering to meet mainstream standards and escape stigma, and argue that it is time for other students to take on a similar responsibility of watching what they say.
Balance, of course, is inherent to equality. But, left-leaning student activists argue, seeking real balance starts with the recognition of current imbalances. The left is angrier and more vocal than ever before because it needs to be — because even a nudge from the right entails mass casualties for the left. Hate speech against already vulnerable minorities is likely to engender violence against them, too, and Trump’s presidency validates conservatives who always sought to snuff out certain movements.
Time journalist Jack Dickey spent time at Towson University speaking with students and faculty to feel out its political climate last year. There, sophomore Bria Johnson argued that college campuses reinforce students’ worldviews when the heavily African American cafeteria staff is juxtaposed against the virtually all-white faculty. There is evidence of injustice everywhere, and it demands attention. As reported by CNN’s Eliot McLaughlin, Lolade Oshin, a senior at Emory, is equally frustrated. 
“As a black woman in America, I have no choice but to hear the other side. But because those individuals are privileged, they don’t have to hear my side,” Oshin said. “One side has grown up having to be sensitive and navigate a white man’s world.” 
Equality in America, then, is not so much about rectifying differences as it is about the flourishing of minority groups in a place that stacked the odds against them. It is on this basis that the left wing of student activism wages its war.
It is its methods and not its mission that come into question. Disorganized and chaotic government has generally presented a greater threat than fascism, but to the fringe left, Trump has changed that. The antifascist movement — commonly known as antifa — has drawn in support from extreme leftists who believe the predicament goes beyond disagreeable politics and calls for outright revolution. The movement is anarchist in nature, seeking to solve problems with direct action, which offers an appealing alternative to those disillusioned by the fruitless process of waiting for Congress to make impossible changes. The left wing has in part taken on antifa’s confrontational methods, escalating disagreeable politics into a full-blown attack on authoritarianism. Antifa may be fighting in the name of a noble cause, but there is danger in its perceived legitimacy and the perceived illegitimacy of government. Contrary to the politicians they despise, antifa leaders cannot be voted out of their positions, and in advocating for the vulnerable they have taken on the responsibility of deciding which Americans can publicly assemble and which cannot — responsibility that rests on no democratic foundation.
Progress stems from discourse, not violence. But antifa and the left wing are acting out against centuries-old systemic discrimination, and they will not be silenced. The right wing must recognize the identities of marginalized groups and adapt to meet their needs for there to be peace.
The result of such a powerful clash is a politicized fight culture with a level of violence that has not graced college campuses since the 1960s. In February 2017, the cancellation of Milo Yiannopolous’ speech at UC Berkeley incited violent conservative protests in which Kyle Chapman, 41, hit an antifa activist in the head with a wooden post. The oldest rule in the book is not to fight fire with fire, but each side has resorted to explicit provocation, yielding campuses that are angry, divided and see little harmony.
But the most devastating consequence of heightened political tensions at American universities is not the material damage, but rather the ensuing silence.
But the most devastating consequence of heightened political tensions at American universities is not the material damage, but rather the ensuing silence. According to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, there have been more than 300 attempts to disinvite campus speakers since 2000. Which side initiated more is irrelevant — what matters is not who is spawning the pressure, but what is at stake because of it.
The fear of discussing controversial topics has stifled discourse at academic institutions and deprived students of exposure to a vast range of ideas. Disagreeable politics should call for counterarguments and stimulating debate, yet students are responding by organizing protests and breeding hostility toward free expression. Controversial speakers are supposed to incite both support and opposition and spark discussion, but instead, universities are avoiding them completely out of fear of overstepping boundaries. Universities should challenge students’ beliefs and prevent them from living inside a psychological bubble, no matter what is inside of it.
The point of higher education is to learn how to apply objective knowledge to a subjective world. Knowledge — whether it is later celebrated or condemned, independent of its source — belongs at academic institutions, where students can interpret it in the context of the real world.
Ultimately, institutions resort to silence and censorship over debate and critical thinking because everyone is sick and tired. Tired of politics, tired of fighting about politics, tired of seeing political propaganda on every screen — a widespread phenomenon called political exhaustion.
Marywood University professor of psychology David Palmiter argues that a lack of habituation exacerbates political fatigue. Habituation is our tendency to adapt to an idea — good or bad — after a period of processing, but that period is neglected because there is never enough time to digest one piece of information before the next surfaces. Consequently, people react with one tool at their disposal: emotion, which often manifests in anger.
You would think overwhelming politics increases politically engagement, but a study conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2014 indicated that only 16 percent of Americans paid attention to the midterm elections. That figure highlights the divide: a vast apathetic and uninformed majority against a mobilized and passionate minority. On both ends, the election has permeated all aspects of life, and everyone is exhausted from walking on political thin ice so as not to slip and fall under.
Political exhaustion has undoubtedly transformed the atmosphere on college campuses. Over half of college students in the U.S. feel that the campus climate prevents people from saying what they believe because others might find it offensive, according to a 2016 Gallup poll. But creating a balance between the unencumbered exchange of ideas and censorship of offensive material feels impossible, and that’s because it is.
But creating a balance between the unencumbered exchange of ideas and censorship of offensive material feels impossible, and that is because it is.
Harvey Klehr, a professor of politics and history at Emory University, has a pointed response to this challenge.
“History is full of very, very upsetting things,” Kehr told CNN in May. “Grow up. The world is a nasty place. If you want to confront it, change it, you have to understand the arguments of nasty people.”
Preventing controversial speakers from exercising their First Amendment Rights is a Band-Aid solution for a long-term problem. Ignoring speakers’ ideas will not make them disappear. If the ultimate goal is to rise above the opposition, it is necessary to understand the opposition. Modern political struggles deserve to be confronted by those who have the potential to change them. Although our minds tend to think unilaterally, the world is always multifaceted, and the ability to think critically about a plurality of ideas enables positive change.
Consider then-presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ speech at Liberty University in 2016. Founded by evangelists, Liberty University is a Christian institution whose student body tends to lean to the right. Although most students did not support Sanders, they welcomed his speech about the relationship between socialism and Christianity. He stimulated an engaging debate about class, and his arguments led some students to reconsider their role as Christians to alleviate poverty. Sanders adapted to his audience by recognizing their beliefs, and the student body in turn appreciated his. Integrating ideas from opposite ends of the spectrum led to a powerful level of discourse that made progress feel possible for both.
Political exhaustion and narrow-minded activism have slowed the flow of knowledge on American college campuses. But a world where ideas live is not the place for a battle of opinions. In light of heightened tensions, it is important to reorient our perception of what exactly free speech at American universities means — not to condone any potentially offensive content, but to enable the objective exchange of ideas that cultivates young minds and renders progress possible. Only when there is mutual recognition and debate in the place of bigotry and anger can there be peace.
I see myself as an Absolutist of the First Amendment. And though USC does not take such a stance, though I wish it did. I believe this article is one of the most well rounded pieces I’ve read. As Republican, ex-Trump Supporter, this article against the backdrop of previous publications by this paper, was a breadth of fresh air. Highlighting your own position and the position of the paper, but you did justice to the other side (my side I guess you could call it). You did not take Freedom of Expression and Speech as far as I do, but it is certainly a place to begin a discussion. In other words: Credit where Credits do.

Few students on this campus have been fortunate enough to escape the classmate smitten with the sound of his or her own contrarianism — the devil’s advocate, as they often self-describe. We’ve all had the distinct displeasure of listening to them plead “not necessarily,” to the most basic of concepts, waiting around as they search for some toothless dispute — which, more often than not, rests not on any real tangible academic qualm but rather the desire to be recognized as a daring, independent thinker. After a few semesters, their presence seems eternal — part of the decor of the University, as intrinsic as that gray carpet and red brick. But that knee-jerk contrarianism is not a valuable criticism of academic thought, and it has not always been characteristic of the college campus. It is indicative of a phenomenon far larger in scope, and much older.

In September 2017, an editorial in a recent edition of Third World Quarterly used counterfactual history to make the case for the benefits of colonialism. Predictably, and especially so when considering Third World Quarterly was published for the express purpose of voicing narratives of the colonized, the rest of academia bristled. Many called for the article’s removal. But still, the article stood as a good example of real scholarly contrarianism — challenging the dominant narrative in order to assess whether it stands up to the criticism, and thus whether it is worthy of being the accepted narrative at all. In this case, scholars wrote myriad longform responses, and demonstrated the ‘offending’ argument to be superficial and baseless in certain, specific ways. In this same vein, we have always seen contrarianism on the college campus. Traditional scholarly contrarianism is part of debate, discussion and consensus — and it has always lived here, in places of higher education and critical thought. 
But today’s political contrarianism arising out of post-Cold War politics, tied up in media influence and polarization — to challenge truth not for the sake of improvement, but for the glee of reaction — should not be confused with the older, scholarly approach. It’s everywhere, disguised as measured politics, wise warnings, illuminating reassessment of supposedly sycophantic national beliefs. We see it shaking up headlines, gathering clicks in the millions, feeding the quintuple-forwarded email chains of our older relatives. Everything you knew about X is wrong! Why Ben Carson Could Sweep 2016! 
In the ’70s, American journalism relied on analysis, narrative and tone to replace the long-form authoritative piece; in the ‘80s, news and argument became even more expedited — enter Andrew Sullivan, Michael Kinsley, and others who traded narrative for the flashy and pithy. The ’90s weathered Mickey Kaus and his Kaus Files (the zit on the face of an even larger zit, Breitbart News) and pieces like Stephen Johnson’s Everything Bad is Good for You. Enter the 2000s and the present, flashy contrarianism became an art form. We know it today as ‘clickbait,’ or perhaps in the larger scope, ‘fake news.’ Even before 2016, President Trump and our present polarization, the Economist was writing in their 2009 Democracy in America feature that “as journalism has come increasingly to focus on contrarianism, it has become less and less adept at actually describing the world.” 
New, exciting journalism, exaggerant headlines and unclear realities — a part of a modern-day polarized America, but not necessarily a result. In general, the bastardization of scholarly contrarianism by American journalism tended to ignore facts and publicize findings that were very, very wrong, mostly for the sake of the same flashiness that characterizes clickbait today. The “debunking” of climate change science in one chapter of Steven Levitt and Steven Dubner’s Superfreakonomics is a good example; marketed not toward academia but the layman, its dramatic denial of climate science stirred remarkable academic unrest. Multiple climate scientists, geologists, geomorphologists and paleoclimatologists had no trouble poking remarkable holes in its reasoning and data — most of which was predicated on cherry-picked facts and misunderstood aggregate results of other studies in order to aid in the melodrama of its assertions. This is not to make a point about the audacity of those who challenge climate science, but instead to ask, who published this? And where were the editors who too could have found the lapses in Superfreakonomics’ judgement, as easily as a geology undergrad?

The consequences of the new contrarianism come from the new nature of journalism: I.e., that our news is as concerned with being popular, or more so, as it is with being correct. Take a few headlines from The New York Times as example: “It’s Not Just Wrestling that’s Fake. It’s the World”; “How Vital Are Women? This Town Found Out as They Left to March.” Clickbait is no longer characteristic only of Buzzfeed quizzes or Breitbart’s primal screams; instead it defines The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post. The Wall Street Journal this week characterized economic tensions between Norway and Russia as “Cold War in the Arctic”; coverage of California wild fires by the Washington Post begins with a jarring “Death Toll Rises.” In that same sense, the new contrarianism is focused not so much on making counterarguments or proving and disproving points, but goading reactions. 
In the context of campus thought, it serves to unfairly bolster arguments which were basically false in the first place — it is, as John Quiggin wrote, “ a cheap way of allowing ideological hacks to think of themselves as fearless, independent thinkers, while never thinking (in fact reinforcing) the status quo.” It feeds into the millennial abdication of responsibility to become truly informed (because everything is probably wrong, anyway) and it mires our news in the Catch-22 of producing attractive almost-falsehood to be read, and losing the public trust from being exaggerative and wrong. It is, as Paulina Borsook wrote, “to see what you want to see in pursuit of defying conventional wisdom; to ignore interconnectedness where convenient; and to do the math but leave out the bits that don’t conform to ideology.”
It also feeds the recent rise of devil’s advocacy language amid the public discourse of the college campus — and encourages its application to issues that do not require a devil’s advocate. Applying scholarly contrarianism to constructively challenge Bernie Sanders’ or Ted Cruz’ economic platforms is good, and the purpose of that contrarianism; but playing devil’s advocate to the safety of gay students from hateful discrimination is not. One is a political and academic position — e.g., ‘taxing the wealthy has the potential to support a free and reduced-cost college program.’ The other is an issue of basic human rights. The application of one is dependent on its correctness or incorrectness — that taxation can either support free college or it cannot, and that result can be objectively evidenced. The success of the other, however, depends not on its objective academic correctness, but the willingness of the dominant group to share power with a disempowered minority. And by promoting contrarian language in reference to movements of much-needed social progress, campus culture encourages an understanding of civil and human rights as nascent philosophical theories, instead of the deeply crucial instruments of national progress they actually are. As Albert Hirschman argued in his work “The Rhetoric of Reaction: Perversity, Futility, Jeopardy,” social change and progress forces societies experiencing that progress to adapt; experts develop solutions to existing problems, and those solutions usually center around forcing a dominant group to share power with a disenfranchised and underserved minority group. Contrarian news, and political contrarianism, both essentially comprise counter-reactions to those processes — arguments against ‘safe spaces’ or task forces, backlash against scholarships for women or minorities, vicious outrage at the expression of oppression or recognition of privilege.

To answer the question of where contrarianism came from or where it is going, we need not look past our own campus. Contrarians like Milo Yiannopoulos drum up firestorms because political contrarianism, whether you agree or disagree with the focus, is sexy, and bigots like Yiannopoulos know and bet on that. Sure, playing devil’s advocate by talking over your peers in your political science intro course can feel like a flashy demonstration of higher thought. To buy into a contrarian political ideology (radical socialism on the left, Tea Partyism on the right) that does nothing but say ‘no’ means you have given yourself to a movement that cannot create its own original ideas, but instead replaces them with pomp. It encourages partisanship, it encourages clickbait news, and it burns the bridge between the chaos we find ourselves in now, and the centrist intellectualism most of us would probably prefer to return to. In short: Maintain scholarly contrarianism, but reject political impetuousness. Be a thoughtful critic, not an inflammatory contrarian.
You say that Contrarianism should only come from those with the “authority” on the positions. Such is a logical fallacy, but I understand that misinformation is out there. Though you tend to highlight only that type of misinfo that attacks leftist positions (like climate change). At the same time you declare some speech, such as one saying that trans gendered people suffer from gender disphoria, questions someone’s human rights. And thus should not be allowed. What an uneducated opinion, or rather one that lacks the fundamental position of freedom of speech. No idea or fact is beyond criticism, and the “authority” of its authors bares no weight to its credibility. This whole article is attempting to give credit to the “argumentum ad verecundiam”. Which “liberals” and “progressives” have for the last 20 years been using to silence opposing opinions.

There’s a sense of doomsday in the air. It isn’t just discouraged — it’s near-apocalyptic. Rapid fires blazed up and down California last week, engulfing Napa and Sonoma counties in the north and Orange County just an hour away from campus. We’re expecting The Big Earthquake any day now. A campus shooting scare marked the beginning of the month. 
It echoes a growing national feeling that the world we once knew is spinning out of control. The President suggested war with North Korea; Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, leaving the territory literally powerless. The largest mass shooting in modern American history gutted the heart of the nation. 
 Facing these challenges, we should be banding together on campus. Yet, it feels like we’re doing the opposite — we’re more divided than ever. Campus protest has become a major mechanism for American students to make their voices heard — for many, as a form of resistance against the Trump administration. Critics lambast the creation of ivory towers of narrow-minded thought, devoid of intellectual or ideological diversity. But students fight for safe spaces on campus and maintain that they should have license over the speakers they choose to legitimize.
It’s indicative of an ideological polarization that has grown so strong that people on either side of the aisle can’t even agree on their premises anymore. Extreme division has made it almost impossible to be a political person on campus, but for many, the moral imperative is too great not to.
With the Daily Trojan’s first-ever Opinion special issue, we hope to capture this political moment at a premier national educational institution, featuring voices from all over the political spectrum and with a variety of conflicting viewpoints about the world we live in. “Living apart, together” wonders how we came to be so divided in the first place. “A new kind of echo chamber” challenges the narrative of universities as liberal echo chambers, where like-minded students hear only their own voices. “Overdosed on activism” wonders whether activist culture on college campuses is productive anymore. “Devil’s advocate” tears into that guy — the maverick in class who takes on a contrarian viewpoint for the sake of argument, to everyone’s chagrin. “A digital disconnect” worries about whether our online interactions further entrench the polarization that we see in person. And “When apathy is a moral disgrace” questions whether having and sharing political opinions is now a requirement of being a good, decent person.
Through these conversations, we hope to better understand the way we talk to each other — and acknowledge how we can improve our political discourse. We live in troubled times, and America may be more broken now than ever before. But we’re today’s college students, and tomorrow’s leaders, so it’s on us to figure out how to fix it.

Adrian Hernandez | Daily Trojan · Presidential Protest · Students gathered to protest President Donald Trump at the Rally for Inclusion and Tolerance on Jan. 18 in E.F. Hutton Park.
When the nation elected Donald Trump to the presidency last November, it was the first election in recent memory that inspired such monumental emotion. At USC, when students streamed directly to Tommy Trojan in the heart of campus, a sense of community felt immediately necessary. The next morning, there were tears, and in the months after, there were peaceful protests and think pieces fruitlessly attempting to understand what happened, and how it changed everything. But the uncanny thing about a disorientation so constant is that it becomes the new normal. So when almost a year later, Trump and the Republican Congress continue to wage injustice after injustice, it does not feel like Election Night 2016, when students allowed their voices to be their hope. It feels like every day brings a new, more horrible battle. And yet, the test is whether empathy, advocating for communities even and especially if they are not one’s own, can last past the initial disillusionment.
And yet, the test is whether empathy, advocating for communities even and especially if they are not one’s own, can last past the initial disillusionment.
As long as there are those who remain disregarded by an administration that refuses to see their humanity, it is a moral imperative that students not let catastrophic moves such as the multiple travel bans or the uncertainty surrounding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program feel routine. These life-changing, family-changing decisions must be protested, or at the very least, spoken about — and not only by those who know what it is like to feel politically oppressed. Simply put: The trait of being “political” nowadays is no longer a personal decision. It is a humanitarian one.
In August, when Trump equated neo-Nazis with the protesters who marched against white nationalists, it was not just the right versus the left. When he threatened the futures of undocumented young people, it was not just the right versus the left. His rhetoric and policies have fundamentally transformed the American political climate into one of progress versus pain. And that is not an exaggeration — though it’s perfectly clear that there are those who take it as such, and who will laugh in this article’s face because of it. Already the counterarguments are waiting: Don’t be overdramatic, don’t be so sensitive. If only it were that simple. 
One of the facts that has become increasingly clear in the past months of political turmoil is that the vocally hateful rely on a very specific group of people to maintain their own voice — the ones who don’t care. If enough people participate in discriminatory behavior and enough people don’t think twice about it, then that behavior is normalized. Apathy and passivity go hand in hand; one cannot exist without the other. And though that may sound false, because not doing something doesn’t necessarily mean that one doesn’t care about the outcome, it simply means that the people who can afford to do nothing about oppressive systems are also the ones who remain unharmed by it. These are the people who — in the long and invisible run of things — actually benefit from them.
One of the facts that has become increasingly clear in the past months of political turmoil is that the vocally hateful rely on a very specific group of people to maintain their own voice — the ones who don’t care.
This article would be remiss not to mention the Huffington Post story that broke through the surface of simmering, righteous, exhausted thinkpieces that have come to populate news outlets’ opinion sections of late: “I Don’t Know How To Explain To You That You Should Care About Other People,” read contributor Kayla Chadwick’s headline, above her article published last June. In it, Chadwick explains how paying a little bit more to help save the lives of strangers is worth the personal sacrifice, saying, “I don’t know how to convince someone how to experience the basic human emotion of empathy.” According to Chadwick, a moral barrier supersedes political difference.
And if it is, indeed, a moral segregation that pushes Americans  in different directions, then it is disconcerting that the contradictions disproportionately exist on the more conservative end of the spectrum: Those who push patriotism and citizenship as the highest American values cannot seem to unequivocally state that it is wrong and obscene for people to own guns that can wreak mass destruction on other Americans. Those who claim to believe in the promise of unborn children’s lives — but who did not say “enough” after 20 children died in a 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Those who are ready to deport undocumented young people who were children when they arrived in the country, who allowed the Child Health Insurance Program to expire earlier this month at the expense of 9 million low-income children. 
For many, renewed and heartbreakingly familiar conversations about gun control and how to prevent more tragedies after the Oct. 1 massacre in Las Vegas embedded a growing hopelessness and resignation that nothing would be done. On his HBO program, late-night comedian Bill Maher decried the rhetoric utilized by Republican leaders after tragedy — “thoughts and prayers” — as empty words, a cheap and inconsequential substitute for effective change. 
Because, strip away politics, strip away allegiance, strip away patriotism, strip away race and gender and age and geography, and it becomes abundantly clear that the attempt to pass gun control legislation is — and is only ever — a testament to the sanctity of human life.
And yet, this resignation at the prospect of inaction was just half of the frustration. There is also the unthinkable prospect of anyone having a differing opinion on the need for gun control at all. Because strip away politics, strip away allegiance, strip away patriotism, strip away race and gender and age and geography, and it becomes abundantly clear that the attempt to pass gun control legislation is — and is only ever — a testament to the sanctity of human life. It is the right to live and to not be afraid of living. 
There is no law or other man’s moral value that supersedes this fact that a person’s right to life should never be measured or brushed aside or put under another’s — or, worse, put under a political ideology. It is one of our nation’s greatest shames that this is seldom applied to today’s politics. And it is confounding that some people pretend to be blind to the injustice apparent in politics today, because they do see it. It is confounding that they do nothing about it. It is confounding that they are quiet. It is confounding that anyone — artists, business people, writers, engineers, doctors, average citizens — can live their lives, in the presence of oppression, and decline to speak up or take any action for fear of “dragging politics into it.” 
In a Jezebel article titled “All the Greedy Young Abigail Fishers and Me,” writer Jia Tolentino dissects the increasing scrutiny over affirmative action after years of counseling affluent white students through their college application processes. In her article, Tolentino characterizes the embrace of colorblind admissions policies as “generally associated with the type of person who has only ever thought of race as something (1) bad that (2) belongs to other people.” This reference to “other people” is crucial. It ties into what Chadwick was talking about in the Huffington Post, about empathy and how it exists in an entirely different place from the political realm. 
It is not hard to empathize. It is basic human instinct. What makes it so difficult, then, for progress to be achieved when so much of it is clearly wrapped up in seeing the worth in other people’s lives? In his New York Times article, “Why Rural America Voted for Trump,” writer Robert Leonard quotes former congressman J. C. Watts: “The difference between Republicans and Democrats is that Republicans believe people are fundamentally bad, while Democrats see people as fundamentally good.” Clearly, though, both sides recognize that not all people are fundamentally good. There are those who don’t see the value in other people’s lives, and who commit actions so unprecedented and unnatural that it forever shifts the way we talk about evil in the modern world. 
Maybe what separates these political sides isn’t an inherent, inflexible worldview. Maybe what so-called liberals see — instead of a stagnant and fixed present — is a future that can be different.
Maybe what separates these political sides isn’t an inherent, inflexible worldview. Maybe what so-called liberals see — instead of a stagnant and fixed present — is a future that can be different. One that lies perhaps out of reach, for now, but that has always held its promise of peace. And there is goodness in this future, where people are worthy simply because they are people. This point can only be reached through marching in the streets, educating friends and family and listening. The issue is simple. There is nothing that connects the human race but empathy, the ability to think beyond one’s own body and walk of life. And across all political issues in which the promise of people’s lives are put at such high stake, empathy is the only thing worth considering. It can and one day will heal this political rift.

Elizabeth Gu | Daily Trojan
Perhaps President Donald Trump was right when he claimed that climate change is a hoax — despite increasing global temperatures, there are millions of young “snowflakes” at college campuses nationwide. 
The so-called snowflake generation has become defined by its diplomatic, fragile, politically correct culture that, as some politicians decry, has gone too far.
“The American university was once the center of academic freedom — a place of robust debate,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a speech given at Georgetown University Law Center in August. “But it is transforming into an echo chamber of political correctness and homogenous thought, a shelter for fragile egos.” 
Sessions is not wrong — there are echo chambers within American academia, and they are becoming deeply damaging. But his implication of the “fragile” college student as the mastermind behind these ideological echo chambers reeks with hypocrisy. 

What Sessions fails to realize is that conditional freedom of expression is not new — America has been rife with censorship for over a century. In 1873, devout Christian Anthony Comstock and the Young Men’s Christian Association sowed the seeds of American censorship. They created the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, which worked to instill Christian morality across America. They reached out to the legal sector, lobbying for national anti-obscenity laws. They ultimately garnered Republican support; thus, in 1873, Congress passed the Comstock Act, criminalizing erotic literature, imagery and information discussing abortion and contraception.
Despite the constitutional principle of the separation of church and state, the Christian, conservative definition of morality became integrated into America’s legal framework and culture. In the 1960s, in response to liberal hippie culture, Christian morality crusaders helped form the modern movie labeling system, which which we now know as G, PG, PG-13 and R. The original premise behind labeling movies was to make the theater a safe space by warning viewers of gory, vulgar or subjectively inappropriate content. 
This use of warnings and safe spaces is just the sort of coddling of the “fragile ego” that politicians like Sessions have been quick to vilify in the millennial generation. Society must be alerted about impending nudity, or gory content, lest the screening of genitals and exploding human bodies burn the innocent eyes of the American public; but how dare trauma victims ask for something operating on a similar premise, like a “trigger warning”, in any and all contexts? Millennials did not invent safe spaces and trigger warnings  — they merely revived these trends. 
So when Sessions, later in his speech, asks:  
“But who decides what is offensive and what is acceptable?”
The answer is something along the lines of “you” — millennials, as it turns out, were merely born into the great echo chamber of fragile, conservative, Christian America complete with trigger warnings and safe spaces of its own. 

While it is a gross misstep to conflate all of Christianity with conservatism, it is important to understand that, as the Pew Research Center found, 82 percent of Republicans are Christian. There’s nothing wrong with Christian monotheism; religion enriches the lives of many and the cultures of all. But Christianity, as it relates to the conservative movement, becomes a problem when people like Sessions criticize universities and millennials for instigating a culture of homogeneity and suppressing academic freedom, when really, the American government has been homogenizing the public and suppressing ideological diversity for over a century. 
And there’s no denying that this sentiment is still present today. 
“We know that it’s the family and the church, not government officials, that know best how to create strong and loving communities. And above all else, we know this: In America, we don’t worship government,” Trump said at the 2017 annual Value Voters Summit, an event for supporters of the governmental integration of religiously conservative values. “We worship God.” 
His actions support the prescription of a conservative Christian framework; he has vowed to increase religious influence in politics by calling for the the demise of the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits tax-exempt religious institutions from endorsing political campaigns, thereby influencing its congregants. And so, America is, and continues to be, trapped in the age-old echo chamber of conservative Christianity. 
Though millennials have invented countless bizarre phenomena — adult onesies, overpriced avocado toast and chlorophyll-infused juices for non-photosynthesizing humans — ideological echo chambers are not one of them. Millennials may be fragile, but they are certainly not the only snowflakes out there. 
Informative piece; but of course, people will always be hypocrites.
how interesting. thanks for your work, sara.

We live in our own self-imposed exile. The existence of other ways of looking at things shocks us, outrages us, drives us to action — on the streets, in the voting booths and on social media. We don’t know “how the other half lives,” and for good reason — the other side often holds views we find repugnant and unworthy of our understanding. Just look at the public’s reception of any given Trump tweet.
New York Times op-ed columnist David Brooks understands this.
“Day by day Trump is turning us into a nation of different planets,” Brooks wrote in one column. “Every planet feels more righteous about itself and is more isolated from and offended by the other planets.” 
His analysis appears to be true, but Brooks, a columnist rather than a researcher, is unable to deeply analyze and depict the roots of this polarized malaise in his writings. Fortunately, bodies of social science research and studies on political polarization illuminate the trends toward division afflicting us at the individual and national levels.
On one level, many scholars have argued that in today’s America, basic social bonds are irreparably broken. Look at their book titles alone — political analyst Yuval Levin portrays The Fractured Republic, in which  social trust is at all-time lows, political scientist Robert Putnam says we’re Bowling Alone instead of with our friends and neighbors and author Charles Murray depicts a society Coming Apart at the seams. So the argument goes, these rifts create a disillusionment that feeds political radicalism, social stratification and myriad other ills.
But there’s another story — one more morally complex and therefore harder to accept. This is the story, partly illustrated by Brooks’s “different planets” metaphor, in which our current divisions are caused not only by malign forces, but also by our own passions, our own friendships and our own loves. By pursuing community with those we trust most, we foster division with those different from us on every level, but most especially in politics. 

Public intellectual Marc Dunkelman depicts this paradox in his 2011 essay, “The Transformation of American Community.” He argues that for most of the 20th century, Americans had three “rings” of community around them — the first, their intimate family; the second, their neighbors and coworkers they shared little in common with; and the third, their single-issue colleagues in particular interests and professional aspects of life. The inner two circles were strong, and the outer third, while important, never dominated.
In the Trump era, we have an entirely different American concept of community. Among some classes in American society, such as those depicted in Murray’s and Putnam’s works, the middle and inner rings of community and family are broken; but in the upper classes, the family circle is tighter than ever before. Meanwhile, due to a variety of trends — changes in the working environment, connections between people of similar interests facilitated by social media, geographic sorting of people into culturally homogenous neighborhoods — the outer ring of groups based on shared passion is also stronger than ever before. 
In a sense, community has become less geographical and more centered around our passions, our loves and our deepest identities. We are free to associate more often with those we feel the strongest connections to, whether they’re our close family and intimate friends, or our professional and political counterparts a continent or an ocean away.
But there’s a cost to this new kind of community. Close, identity-based communities result in individuals mostly experiencing their own homogenous groups, so division exists both physically and socially — even virtually. According to Pew’s report entitled “Political Polarization in the American Public,” Americans increasingly prefer to live in neighborhoods where their values are not only respected, but also shared and realized. Seventy-six percent of liberals polled thought it was important to live in communities with ethnic diversity; 57 percent of conservatives polled believed in the importance of living in highly religious neighborhoods (and as Pew’s 2014 report “Beyond Red vs. Blue: The Political Typology” points out, ethnic diversity is generally an indicator of social liberalism, while deep religious faith is typically a characteristic of conservative communities). Pew also claims that more Republicans tend to live in Republican-dominated neighborhoods, and that Democrats tend to live among fellow Democrats.
Ideological homogenization applies to the first ring, as well. Pew’s Political Polarization report notes that two-thirds of strong conservatives and half of strong liberals confess to having mostly conservative or mostly liberal friends, respectively. And while conservatives are more likely to eschew talking about politics with liberals than vice-versa, more liberals than conservatives polled have reported ending friendships over political disagreements. The numbers would suggest that the desire to be with one’s own is very real, and can at least sometimes have negative effects.
This is the kind of world in which the “fake news” phenomenon can flourish. Recent controversies over election hacking have brought fake news to the forefront, but less commonly reported is that, as Pew reports, 47 percent of conservatives see primarily political opinions they agree with on social media, as do 32 percent of liberals. In other words, the politically active among us self-curate the information we consume already, on our own. We live in our own partisan echo chambers, partly due to Facebook algorithms and possible Russian nefariousness, but far more importantly because our Facebook friends — our friends — are more likely to be people we agree with on political issues.
As Dunkelman argues, there is a very real social and political cost to this new social situation. When we are used to agreeing with our friends and colleagues on most great issues  — or rather, having them agree with us — we lose certain traits that make for more harmonious political life. 
Dunkelman argues that when neighbors voted for different parties and had jobs on different levels of the food chain, they learned to live with each other’s differences. 
“Americans with different points of view were perpetually forced to confront one another face to face,” he writes. 
And there was a virtuous side-effect: “But this same push and pull, jockeying for power, and demand for compromise necessitated constant collaboration, and in the end fertilized American dynamism.” 
Sure, it might be uncomfortable to interact with people who disagree with you. But in the end, that sort of discomfort, competition and compromise make for, as Dunkelman argues, a healthier and humbler civic culture.
Is it right to only have friends who agree with you, or is it right to have intellectually diverse friend groups? The answer to this question probably lies in one’s ultimate values and goals.

If the goal is to stand up for what is right at all costs, to fight for truth and justice no matter what, to be comfortable in one’s righteousness and to fundamentally transform the world, perhaps it is perfectly alright to have similarly-minded friends.
But is the goal is to live as a citizen in a reasonably benign community, to work collaboratively with diverse groups of people, to understand the diversity of the human experience and to humbly accept the fallibility and limitedness of one’s own rationality and righteousness, then the answer is the opposite. In that case, there are moral reasons to cultivate relationships with people of diverse intellectual backgrounds, whose conclusions might be troubling and even offensive. America in 2017 is full of friendships on either side of the aisle, and fewer across it; without rejecting the friendships on either side, perhaps it would be helpful for more Americans to bridge the gap. 
On campus, that starts at the lowest, simplest level — meeting people across the aisle at political events and in political clubs; understanding, when you argue or advocate for certain positions, that those with opposite views aren’t necessarily the enemy; and being open to cultivating friendships with people who might be wrong about most things. These are all hard to do — but they are rewarding nonetheless.

America’s universities suffer from cognitive dissonance. We prop up institutions of higher education as harmonious laboratories of dialogue and marketplaces of ideas, but in reality, campuses remain divisive and polarizing. 
Sadly, the worst is yet to come. A 2016 Freshman Survey by the UCLA’s Higher Education Research Institute found that freshmen already arrive to campus more polarized than they’ve been in more than four decades. 
So why do we see this disconnect between expectations for our higher education and its reality?
It might be because so many of our interactions now happen online. Assuming most of today’s college students are millennials, data shows that they spend nearly nine hours a day consuming social media; and thanks to ideologically consistent friends and well-curated newsfeeds, a University of Michigan study found that social media users read stories that “largely fit their worldview and rarely challenge their beliefs or broaden their perspectives,” further entrenching them in opposing camps. In fact, according to Facebook data reported by the Brookings Institution, each user “has five politically like-minded friends for every one friend on the other side of the spectrum.” And so digital addiction stemming from overexposure to newsfeeds has created not only emotional consequences, but also political ones. 
More insidious is research from Facebook data scientists, which indicates that users clicking on partisan links increases the chances of them seeing similar stories with similar slants in the future. As a result, this algorithm cements a cycle of confirmation bias and online bubbles. 
“[U]ser choice decreases the likelihood of clicking on a cross-cutting link by 17 percent for conservatives and 6 percent for liberals,” the Brookings Institute wrote of the research. 
That means that our choices, coupled with the Facebook algorithm, reduce the likelihood of us encountering and engaging with opinions other than our own.
On campus, the digital revolution has never made it easier to disconnect and disengage with perspectives that we find distasteful, whether that be through unfriending political opponents or restricting our news feed to sources consistent with our convictions. Sometimes, such restrictions manifest subtly. Every time we “like” a partisan news source on Facebook, its stories are more likely to show up on our newsfeeds — at the expense of other, more balanced sources.
Students enter a vicious cycle in which the divisions of the digital world spill over into in the real world, but when confronted with differing opinions or harsh rhetoric, students retreat from reality back into their online echo chambers.
When this online polarization shifts to the offline world, it sets students up for failure upon arrival in the classroom. In fact, a Washington Post poll indicates that more than half of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton supporters don’t know anyone who voted for the other candidate.
We held high hopes for the power of the digital to transform politics.
Pundits dubbed former President  Barack Obama’s 2008’s victory over Sen. John McCain as the first “Facebook Election,” with social media playing a major role in democratizing access to candidates and their platforms. And greater online democratization of political information soon followed, with tweets, commentaries, impassioned wars of words and opinion articles flooding America coast to coast. Soon, everyone became a consumer and contributor to the vast dialogue, with two-thirds of adults receiving news from social media and “collectively, the weekly readership of the top dozen political blogs rivaling that of Time, Newsweek, or The New York Times.” For the first time in history, anyone and everyone, at any time, anywhere could participate in the grand experiment of ready access to any and all commentary and information.
But now, instead of tearing down barriers, we’ve created new ones. And instead of forming the well-educated citizenry dreamed of during America’s birth, greater access to information anytime, anywhere has rendered us more divided and misinformed.
Online polarization and fake news often go hand in hand, with a proliferation of slanted, and even false, journalism heavily contributing to both online and offline entrenchment of political ideologies.
A BuzzFeed study analyzed three large rightwing political Facebook pages and found 38 percent of their posts to include “false or misleading information,” while three large leftwing political pages hardly fared much better, with 19 percent of posts flagged as ones classified as fake, or at least deceptive, news. Yet these findings hardly scratch the surface of this credibility crisis, with the dissemination and proliferation of online forums such as Reddit and 4chan providing platforms for trolls to freely wield power and distort opinions and facts.
For example, in the wake of the massacre in Las Vegas, online discussions rapidly came to life, claiming the official death count and identity of the shooter to be fabricated and falsely accusing various groups, such as the anti-Trump antifa (short for antifascist) for the attack itself. These forums, though laboratories of discourse, albeit with little moderation and reputability, often divert dialogue toward fringe and unfounded opinions.
Despite its label as the technologically literate generation less susceptible to the sirens of misinformation, millennials often pose as some of the biggest victims of this war between fact and falsehood. In 2016, Stanford researchers conducted a study to discern the ability of the younger generations to identify information sources and they classified the results as “dismaying,” “bleak” and “[a] threat to democracy.” Among their findings: “Most middle school students can’t tell native ads from articles,” “Many high school students couldn’t tell a real and fake news source apart on Facebook,” “Most college students didn’t suspect potential bias in a tweet from an activist group,” and “Most Stanford students couldn’t identify the difference between a mainstream and fringe source.” For a generation now the largest in the nation, the future of political awareness and engagement looks bleak.
Collectively, this toxic mixture of overconsumption of heavily ideological media and our inability to discern fact from fiction takes a toll on our ability to engage in political dialogue. According to Pew Research Center, the number of consistently conservative or liberal Americans has more than doubled over the past two decades from 10 percent to 21 percent. And polarization often morphs into outright hostility, with highly negative views of the opposite party more than doubling since 1994.
To escape these bubbles we must first disconnect — from the echo chambers we’ve taken refuge in, from the divisive dialogue we consume and participate in and from the sensationalism we live and breathe. This takes the form of engagement of those of differing political beliefs, consumption of media from both sides of the ideological aisle and casting a critical eye toward information and sources whose validity we take for granted.
At some point, we must physically disconnect ourselves from the digital world as well — to engage in substantial discussion without repeating online soundbites, to bridge the gap between the perceptions we’ve been fed and reality and to form our own opinions based on factual, reputable sources. The fate of our discourse and our democracy depends on it.

To celebrate the entrepreneurial spirit of USC students during Trojan Family Weekend, student entrepreneurs across different schools and disciplines competed for funding at the 11th Annual USC Stevens Student Innovator Showcase. At the event, students showcased their ideas and startup inventions in the hopes of receiving USC-sponsored funding to further develop and fine-tune their products. Ten finalists received different prizes.
Twenty-four teams were present to set up booths and consequently pitch their ideas and companies. Each hoped to win one of the $31,000 cash prizes allocated for student entrepreneurs’ beta launches, prototypes and product developments. 
Luke Vincent Naman, a medical student represented Vibraille, a company creating braille e-readers. He was one of the finalists of the showcase. During the event, Naman set up a booth displaying a laptop connected to a television playing a presentation of Vibraille. In front of the television was a Vibraille prototype Naman said he created using popsicle sticks, vibration motors and hot glue.
“[Vibraille] uses vibrations across your entire hand to read instead of your fingertips reading raised or flat dots,” Naman said. “Its purpose is to provide a cheaper alternative to the e-readers that are on the market currently.” 
According to Naman, a braille e-reader can cost thousands of dollars. Creating a cheaper alternative could help the blind population increase reading speeds and legibility. 
Naman said he developed Vibraille during the summer. That is when he began researching competitors and seeking feedback. 
“I took an early prototype to the Braille Institute Los Angeles [Center] and had it tested with one of the blind heads of technology,” Naman said. 
Although each competing project differed greatly from each other — from technologically advanced products like Vibraille aimed at serving an underrepresented population to an all-in-one dipping sauce for Asian cuisine — teams also had to focus on professionally honing and delivering their pitch to interested entrepreneurs and judges. 
“[As entrepreneurs], we have been able to grow as the result of each pitch competition,” said alumnus Maxine Lau, the co-founder of Lahtt Sauce, another top finalist in the Student Innovator Showcase. 
Lahtt Sauce is an all-in-one sauce for dipping, stir-fry and marinade, which the founders describe as a health-conscious, authentic, bold and modern addition to any comfort food.
Lau and her partner Qiyuan You, a graduate student studying social entrepreneurship, wanted to participate in the competition to improve their product pitch to potential consumers and judges. 
When Lau and You began pitching their product, Lau said they worked to better market their product and their gross profit margin as a company. Each piece of advice they received in pitch competitions was an actionable step the founders were able to apply to improve Lahtt Sauce. 
Lau and You have already placed Lahtt Sauce in numerous specialty stores and hope to receive funding from the showcase to launch in natural grocers such as Whole Foods Market. 
As two of the top 10 finalists, Vibraille and Lahtt Sauce presented a three-minute pitch on stage in front of an audience and a panel of nine industry judges. Nine judges selected five teams for awards while the sixth team was decided by a democratic voting system. Naman won the $2,500 Most Potentially Disruptive Award and Lau and You received the $2,500 Venture Validation Award. 
“This whole experience has really made me critical of what I’m creating,” Naman said. “To inspect every aspect of Vibraille in ways I hadn’t thought of before.”

In the past 50 years, universities and schools have become a site for shootings. 
From tragedies like the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre to the fatal officer shooting at Texas Tech University  on Oct. 9, the possibility of violence hangs in the air at American universities. Preparedness during crises is emphasized among law enforcement and public safety officials, and at USC, this is no exception. When false reports of an active shooter at Fertitta Hall came in on Monday, Oct. 2, USC’s preparation was put to the test. 
The University’s response reaffirmed these preparation methods, said Steve Goldfarb, fire safety emergency planning specialist. 
Departments like Goldfarb’s, along with the Office of Campus Wellness and Crisis Intervention team, work to ensure the campus and its students, faculty and staff are prepared for any type of crisis. While the event at Fertitta Hall disrupted the campus, USC’s reaction pointed out both strengths and flaws in the systems Goldfarb and others spent months developing.
“One of the things that we should all feel really good about in this case is that within three minutes of getting the call that there was an active shooter, Los Angeles Police Department and Special Weapons and Tactics were in the building,” Goldfarb said. 
While addressing the issue is a priority, communication remains important. TrojansAlert is a system that sends out updates from DPS during a crisis via text message and email. During an emergency, TrojanAlerts will be DPS’ primary point of communication with the community, said DPS Assistant Chief of Public Safety David Carlisle. 
“Every student, every faculty member should be enrolled, but we know that may not be the case, people change their phone numbers, things happen,” Carlisle said. “That’s when we would expect people to exchange information in the classroom. So that’s the primary way of getting the message out.”
As the incident unfolded, students received five different text messages from TrojansAlert, starting with an initial report to avoid the area and shelter, and ending with the final alert that Fertitta Hall had reopened.
A TrojansAlert text was sent at 12:29 p.m., informing students that the police were searching the hall after unconfirmed reports of shots fired. The next text was sent at 1:04 p.m., this time stating there was no evidence of gunfire and that campus activities could resume. In the 35 minutes TrojansAlert was silent, students were not. 
Katlyn Lee | Daily Trojan
The University recognized that this silence was becoming problematic as rumors spread, said Vice Provost for Campus Wellness and Crisis Intervention Varun Soni. 
“I will say that in this particular case there was a lot of misinformation online, a lot of false reporting that exacerbated the anxiety on campus,” Soni said. “So, it’s really important that TrojansAlert becomes the legitimate source of information that’s verified.” 
Carlisle noted that DPS’ primary function is to keep the University campus safe.  In a developing situation, this may not always correlate to the instant communication that students desire. 
“We are doing our best to verify the information, with the most accurate information, as quickly as practical in an emergency situation,” Carlisle said. “And sometimes that takes a little time to verify what we’re hearing.” 
Another issue presented with TrojansAlert lies in its platform — primarily, cell phones. In classes where use of electronic devices is prohibited, students or faculty may not be able to see a TrojansAlert, potentially delaying or preventing them from quickly responding to an emergency. According to Carlisle, these considerations are currently being discussed. Possible improvements include emergency message board systems or loudspeakers to ensure the message is received on multiple platforms.
However, even before the events at Fertitta, USC had placed significance on emergency preparedness. Soni leads the University’s crisis intervention office, which was developed in the 2017-18 school year. 
The office has three goals: create a culture of wellbeing to prevent threats by developing, help those facing personal crises and develop a system to assess crises. This includes hiring the University’s first-ever Chief of Threat Assessment, Patrick Prince. 
“We want to do a better job making sure our entire community feels prepared in an active shooter scenario,” Soni said. “These are always traumatic instances and that makes it more important to empower people to make sure they feel like they know what to do in the certain cases.” 
Goldfarb encourages USC students, faculty and staff to visit USC’s safety website. He recommends all watch a new nine-minute emergency procedures video. While watching the video is not a widespread requirement, Goldfarb expects it to become a part of new student orientation, hopefully beginning in Spring 2018. 
Whether it’s an earthquake or an active shooter incident, Goldfarb encourages all to take initiative before the crisis occurs, like knowing multiple exit routes from their classes and residential hall. 
“It’s [about] taking personal responsibility to make sure you understand the emergency procedures,” Goldfarb said. 
Goldfarb, Soni and Carlisle know that any incident, even a false alarm, can be traumatic. However, instead of creating fear, they hope the incident at Fertitta Hall provides the USC community with motivation to prepare. 
“We want all students, faculty and staff to make sure they take our emergency preparedness, not just our active shooter training, but all of our preparedness very seriously,” Carlisle said. “It could happen here.”

Over the weekend, the No. 19 women’s volleyball team surged past Cal in a four-set victory on Friday before losing to No. 3 Stanford in four sets on Sunday, snapping its perfect record at the Galen Center. With the split, USC now moves to 14-5 on the season and 6-2 in Pac-12 play.
On Friday, the Trojans stormed back from an early 11-8 deficit to win the first set 25-21, but they dropped a tightly contested second set 29-27 after Mima Mirkovich of the Golden Bears struck for two kills to tie the match. Despite splitting the first two sets, USC overwhelmed the Bears in the third set 25-15 and closed out with another tight 25-23 fourth-set win. In the third set, the Women of Troy capitalized on 10 Cal errors, and junior outside hitter Alyse Ford was key for the Trojans in the fourth set, as she recorded six kills in crucial possessions to bury the Golden Bears’ momentum for good. The Trojans never trailed in the final two sets.
In the win, the Trojans’ offense was powered by senior opposite hitter Brittany Abercrombie, who recorded a team-high 16 kills with a .308 hitting percentage. Sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier also chipped in with 15 kills, while senior opposite hitter Niki Withers recorded 13 and Ford racked up 12. Senior setter Reni
Meyer-Whalley and sophomore setter Cindy Marina recorded 27 and 25 assists, respectively, and junior libero Victoria Garrick recorded 22 digs.
After a break on Saturday, USC returned on Sunday to take on third-ranked juggernaut Stanford. The Cardinal jumped out early in the first set and took a commanding 25-18 win behind a stable offense spearheaded by Kathyrn Plummer and Audriana Fitzmorris. In the second set, the Trojans used a 7-1 run to take the early lead before the two teams seesawed back and forth for the lead. With the set tied at 23 apiece, a Stanford error followed by a Meyer-Whalley service ace sealed a hard-fought second-set win for the Trojans.
Despite an early Trojan lead at 12-11, the Cardinal used a 10-2 run to distance themselves from the Trojans and take the third set 25-17. The Trojans grabbed a 12-10 lead again in a tightly contested fourth set, but the Cardinal used a 8-1 run to take the lead back at 18-13. Head coach Mick Haley responded by taking a timeout, and the Trojans answered with a 7-0 run of their own to keep the game alive. 
“[Haley] just told us to make sure we’re attacking the ball,” Withers said. “Basically, he was telling us to go for it: Stay focused, and everything will come to you.”
With a 20-18 Trojan lead, the two teams traded point-for-point until Plummer and Fitzmorris recorded kills to tie the game. An error and a service ace from Meghan McClure iced the game for a Stanford victory.
Lanier led USC with 14 kills on Sunday, though the Cardinal held her to a .068 percentage while limiting 13 of her 14 kills to the opening two sets. Like Friday’s match, Abercrombie (12 kills, .370 percentage), Withers (11 kills, .556 percentage) and Ford (10 kills, .136 percentage) also helped spearhead the Trojan attack.
Meyer-Whalley and Marina recorded 22 and 18 assists, respectively, while Garrick led the team again with 15 digs. 
“Sometimes the scores don’t show how close the match was,” Haley said. “I told [the team]: We’re all upset that we didn’t win, but we’re getting there. Every week we’re getting a little bit better. We can do a lot better than this.”
After the hard-fought loss, USC will now focus its attention on next weekend, when the team travels to Colorado and Utah. 
“We get two practices on Tuesday and Wednesday before we fly to Boulder,” Haley said. “We really do need to come to those practices ready to go. I will be very surprised if anybody is hanging their head when they come out of the locker room. That was the instruction: ‘We’re not feeling sorry for ourselves. Next time we get in this situation, we’ve been there once, [and] we should be a lot better.’”
USC will play Colorado at 7 p.m. on Friday and Utah at noon on Sunday.
