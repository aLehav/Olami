The best music artists find ways to reinvent their style over time without straying too far from their old work. While it can be challenging to strike a balance between appeasing longtime fans and creating original music, Los Angeles-based rock band FIDLAR makes a leap of faith on its latest album “Almost Free.” FIDLAR opts for a pop punk route that challenges its punk rock roots. Though FIDLAR deserves praise for its courage to shift gears sonically, some tracks on the album force listeners to question if they’re even listening to FIDLAR — and not always in a good way. 
While an artist should never be confined to one genre, “Almost Free” disappoints at times due to its overwhelmingly commercial pop undertones. A dramatic shift from its self-titled debut and sophomore record “Too,” “Almost Free” attempts to balance FIDLAR’s typical subject matter of getting high and drunk off cheap beer with more complex political commentary. 
The album starts with the aggressive, high-energy “Get Off My Rock.” The Beastie Boys-inspired undertones shine through, providing an exciting introduction for the rest of the album. 
However, things take a sharp turn with “Can’t You See,” which takes on a laidback, pop sound. “Can’t You See” is easily FIDLAR’s most radio-friendly track off the album, perhaps even of the band’s entire career. It has a catchy chorus and soothing instrumentals, which fans can appreciate, but the break from FIDLAR’s style can be jarring. 
“By Myself” follows with another stereotypical pop track, yet the song is lyrically centered on FIDLAR’s typical adolescent themes and subject matters. “By Myself” may cause listeners to stop and check that they’re not accidentally listening to The Mowgli’s. 
“Flake” and “Alcohol” return to FIDLAR’s raw and aggressive roots, while title track “Almost Free” best highlights FIDLAR’s creativity and willingness to explore new musical avenues. Purely instrumental, “Almost Free” is as a thoughtful transition from the forceful “Alcohol” to the thought-provoking “Scam Likely.” Lead singer Zac Carper’s opening verses on the song that comment on selfishness in today’s political climate.
“See the man with the gun in his hand / Livin’ in his own wasteland,” Carper sings. “He don’t care ’bout the government / Unless it helps him get ahead.” 
Some of the tone changes can be attributed to the enlistment of Grammy-nominated producer Ricky Reed, who has worked with artists like Leon Bridges and Twenty One Pilots. “Almost Free” may alienate some of FIDLAR’s longtime fans, but it will undoubtedly appeal to more mainstream audiences. The album tests FIDLAR’s versatility and musicianship. The band shines on tracks like “Scam Likely,” while it fails on others like “By Myself.”
Despite these deviations, the album provides plenty of tracks for those wanting to hear the iconic angsty FIDLAR sound. “Almost Free” has the opportunity to help FIDLAR gain new listeners while retaining the style that started FIDLAR’s career.

As streaming giant Netflix gears up to face growing competition from other platforms, it has tightened up its original programming. The service has abruptly ended several acclaimed shows, notably Marvel Studios’ “Daredevil” and “Luke Cage.” The latest victim of the Netflix cancellation frenzy is the campy comedy “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.” While its final episodes’ storylines are inconsistent at best, the show’s snappy performances and subtly insightful one-liners remain impactful.
Though varied in popularity, “Kimmy Schmidt” has earned a solid following and equally positive critical reception in its five-year run. The series was created by Tina Fey in an attempt to give Ellie Kemper (who plays the titular character) a world that could most compellingly manifest the naive, idealistic characters she portrayed in “The Office” and “Bridesmaids.” 
The show revolves around the misadventures of Schmidt, a 29-year-old who has escaped a bunker in which she was held captive for 15 years. After moving to New York City, where she moves in with failing actor Titus Andromedon (Tituss Burgess) and landlord Lillian Kaushtupper (Carol Kane), Schmidt seeks to rebuild her life. 
Throughout its run, the series has used Kimmy’s wishful attitude to critique the modern world. It often hilariously satirizes politics, corporations and millennial trends. The series was strongest in its first few seasons, but declined in quality and popularity as the storylines skated too far into campiness and lacked the biting social commentary that made its initial offerings resonant. 
The second half of the fourth and final season, released Jan. 25, acts as an attempt to correct the series’ missteps and conclude it on a high note.
The writers are mostly successful, nodding to the corruption of Hollywood, the ridiculous nature of modern politics and the social movements that drive popular culture narratives today. In “Kimmy Fights a Fire Monster!” Titus speaks up about a sexual assault scandal in a tasteful yet humorous way. In “Kimmy is Rich,” Kimmy’s friend and former employer Jacqueline White, portrayed by the scene-stealing Jane Krawoski, deals with another talent agent who shares her narcissism and cutthroat attitude. Though wholly underused within these episodes, Krawoski remains the show’s standout.
The most ambitious of the final episodes is the supersized “Sliding Van Doors,” in which the storyline considers an alternate reality where Kimmy had never been held in captivity. Despite a few funny and insightful moments about life and career ambitions, the episode is largely forgettable in its bloated state. Though it aims to bolster the final season, it falls flat in an attempt to broaden the scope of the show.
In fact, the final few episodes largely fail to give the supporting cast much story to work with at all. In wrapping up the show, it is only Titus and Kimmy who are given conclusive arcs. With Titus reuniting with his will-they-won’t-they boyfriend Mickey and Kimmy finally making an impact with the feminist children’s book she wrote, there is little room left to focus on Jacqueline and Lillian. This is a mistake, because the two are at their comedic best in this season. Kane’s and Krawoski’s talents are undermined in the episode, with neither getting the proper screen time she deserves. 
Fey and co-creator Robert Carlock end the series as it began, with the quirky protagonist attempting to make sense of and effect change in the world around her. Though the audience of this series was small, those who stayed for the wit and camp will surely miss this flawed, yet uniquely wacky series.

If your experiences missing concerts are anything like mine, then you’ll surely relate to the pain of FOMO. Sure, there are fan videos taken from the crowd or live streams of the event. But I’ve always wanted something that could make me feel like I was actually there, even from home. Up until now, that wasn’t possible. 
Today, thanks to advancements in technology, virtual and augmented reality are making that dream come true. If adopted quickly and used correctly, VR could be huge for the next decade of the music industry. 
Live events are potentially the biggest fields for virtual reality. Missing concerts always hurts, and having a platform that allows someone to view the show they missed — as if they were actually there — would be highly popular. I am convinced that within the next five years, watching concerts through virtual reality headsets will become common.
It’s actually already beginning to happen. In September 2017, NextVR partnered with LiveNation to stream the Global Citizen Music Festival in virtual reality. They also currently offer a LiveNation “channel” on their platform, which broadcasts VR recordings of concerts and other music-related events. 
The VR startup MelodyVR presents a similar service, and it has now acquired licenses from three major record labels (and is the only VR startup to have done so thus far). The company made deals with over 600 artists, including Jay-Z. Seeing as how live events are one of the most profitable aspects of the music business, making moves to incorporate an emerging technology like this will only improve their economic viability.
Aside from concerts and festivals, VR technology would also be applicable in many other areas of the business. One example? Music videos. Imagine the famous video-film for “Thriller,” shot in VR: Viewers would feel as though they themselves were being paraded by Michael Jackson and his zombie friends. There could also be a companion video shot entirely in VR through the perspective of one of Jackson’s dancers, enabling viewers to fully immerse themselves in the choreography and plot. Implementing VR in this way would greatly enhance the landscape of visual media for music.
VR can also be used to enhance fan interaction online, for viral marketing campaigns, merchandising and online ticketing. (Being able to view the stage from a particular seat in a venue before purchasing a ticket? Sign me up.) The possibilities are infinite.
However. the issue with such technologies is that there is potential for misuse. In the future, if being able to see Beyoncé live and in person becomes more difficult for someone than seeing Beyoncé from their couch through VR, that may pose a significant issue for touring musicians. Also, just as streaming culture arguably weakens the value of music among the general public, VR streams of concerts can similarly weaken the value of attending live events. 
Thus, there would need to be a way to encourage society to view VR as a supplement for the traditional concert experience and not a replacement. Perhaps there could be a premium attached to VR streams of concerts; those who purchase the VR stream would pay a ticket price (for that show) in addition to a small fee for the convenience of never having to leave the comfort of their living rooms. This also opens the door for VR recordings of concerts, which can be sold alongside traditional Blu-ray discs. 
Virtual reality has the potential to become as lucrative and revolutionary for the music business as iTunes and digital downloads were. However, before embarking on that quest, we must find a method of monetization that satisfies everyone and a way to maintain the value of music without interference from disruptive technologies.

Five-star wide receiver Bru McCoy, who committed to USC during the early signing period on Dec. 19, officially transferred to Texas Friday, according to Yahoo Sports. 
After entering the NCAA transfer portal Thursday, McCoy, the Trojans’ highest-ranked recruit in their 2019 class, will leave the school just weeks after taking classes at USC.
McCoy is No. 9 on 247 Sports’ overall prospect rankings and was USC’s only five-star recruit. McCoy was set to join freshman Amon-ra St. Brown, junior Michael Pittman and redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns, among others, in a talented Trojan receiving corps in 2019.
Because McCoy already signed his letter of intent and enrolled at USC, he needs to be released from the agreement in order to play this season. McCoy will have to sit out the 2019 season if he isn’t released from his NLI because he hasn’t completed a full academic year at the University.
McCoy’s transfer contributes to the negative perception surrounding a program that was criticized for underperforming last season. McCoy played with St. Brown and freshman quarterback JT Daniels at Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, and represented a continuing pipeline of talent from one of the country’s best high school football programs into the University. Now that McCoy has spurned the Trojans, it’s worth wondering if that connection will lose its power.

The USC men’s volleyball team fell 1-3 to defending national champion and top-ranked Long Beach State on the road Friday. 
Long Beach State received its national championship banner during a brief ceremony before the game, making for an energized  crowd. 
“I remember stepping out onto the court for the second set and looking around and seeing the stadium packed,” said senior outside hitter Ryan Moss. “It was a really exciting environment, and I just felt very grateful to be playing in that environment.”
The Beach dominated the Trojans 25-17 in the first set. USC, now 5-3 on the season, shifted the momentum in the second set, gaining an 11-8 lead and keeping the score tight throughout the frame, although Long Beach State ultimately prevailed 26-24. 
The teams traded leads in the third set until the Trojans pulled ahead with an 18-14 lead that the Beach could not make up. The set ended 25-19, making USC the first opponent that Long Beach State has lost a set to this season. The Beach fired back in the fourth, quickly gaining a 6-1 lead that they maintained for a 25-17 finish. 
“That first set we really got knocked back, we took a punch to the face there, but I was really proud of how we responded,” Moss said. “We were able to make the rest of the match competitive, we were able to take a set off them, and I think our team just did a really good job of focusing on our side of the net and doing the things we’re good at, rather than letting our opponents dictate the flow of the game or how the match was played.”
Senior outside hitter Gianluca Grasso, sophomore middle blocker Sam Lewis and Moss led the Trojan offense with nine, seven and 14 kills, respectively. Senior libero Matt Douglas led the defense with seven digs. 
Senior setter Josh Tuaniga was crucial to the Beach’s win with five aces and seven digs, while senior libero Jordan Molina contributed 11 digs.
Moss credited the team’s coaching staff for the hard work and late nights they put into preparing the Trojans for any opponent. 
“Our coaches have done an immense amount of work on preparation and scouting reports and getting us prepared with a solid game plan,” he said. “When we go out onto the floor we’ve done so much preparation, we’ve watched so much film that we know what every guy wants to do, we know rotation by rotation what they want to do.” 
Moss added that the team hopes it will develop the ability to completely internalize the scouting report.
“We hope to get better and better as we go, but we want to get to the point where once the game starts we don’t have to worry about what they’re doing because we already know, and we can just focus on us,” he said. 
Mental preparation has been key for the Trojans while facing top-ranked teams like Long Beach State and UC Irvine in the last week.
“I think nerves are so important to acknowledge, and we’ve done a lot of work in the offseason with our mental preparation,” Moss said, crediting team psychologist Dylan Firsick for preparing the team for high-pressure situations.
“If you’re anxious, if you’re excited, you know that means you’re ready to compete, and you want to play. The ups and downs, all the highs and lows and emotions just come with the game.”
The Trojans are back home this week to host Princeton on Thursday at 7 p.m. at Galen Center. They will then travel to square up against UC Irvine on Saturday at 7 p.m.

Senior forward Bennie Boatwright drilled a cold-blooded 3-pointer with 11 seconds remaining to ice the Sun Devils and secure a 69-67 home victory for the Trojans Saturday night.
Senior point guard Derryck Thornton and junior guard Jonah Mathews played roles just as pivotal as that of Boatwright as the upperclassmen freed up just enough space for “Bennie Buckets” to transform into “Bennie Big Shot” and push the Trojans to 5-2 in Pac-12 play.
“Derryck did a great job bringing his man down and Jonah said he was going to set one for me,” Boatwright said after leading the Trojans with 17 points. “They got me open. I got a good look at it, and I was able to knock it down.”
Boatwright’s game-winning 3-pointer will rightfully receive most of the praise, but it was the Trojans’ stellar team defense that helped them gut out a tough conference win. Since entering conference play, USC has held four of its last seven opponents below 70 points and has only allowed a single opponent to shoot 50 percent from the floor.
“We’ve been playing great defense for a month … our team has progressively gotten better this year on both sides of the ball,” head coach Andy Enfield said.
That improvement was on full display as the stifling defense held Arizona State to just 30 percent shooting on the night and less than 20 made field goals. 
On the other side of the court, Boatwright dominated in the low post with fadeaways out of double teams and powerful finishes when operating one-on-one. Senior guard Shaqquan Aaron had his best shooting performance of conference play, hitting three critical 3-pointers and finishing with 13 points. 
“[Aaron] played a great game,” Enfield said. “He was in the right spots and challenged shots. He’s a very smart player.”
As a whole, the Trojans  seemed mentally prepared, overcoming a tough Arizona State team and a rough night of whistles. 
With 18 free throw attempts on the night, the Trojans finished with seven fewer shots from the charity stripe than ASU and found themselves debating calls for most of the game. The calls also managed to hinder some of the most pivotal pieces on the Trojan roster.
Foul trouble limited junior forward Nick Rakocevic to just 25 minutes of play, yet he still managed to leave his mark on the game, totaling 15 points on 6-for-8 shooting and grabbing nine total rebounds. 
On the other hand, the limited playing time proved too little for freshman guard Kevin Porter Jr. to gain enough momentum and leave a lasting impression on the game. Porter played just nine minutes after picking up three fouls in the first half, shooting 0-for-4 from the field and turning the ball over three times.
Nevertheless, the Trojans banded together to scrape out an important victory.
“It was a great team win and very important for the Pac-12 race,” Enfield said.
USC now sits at No. 2 in the Pac-12 standings and will face the conference-leading Washington Huskies at 8 p.m. Wednesday at Alaska Airlines Arena.

The USC men’s basketball team could not have asked for a better week. Last Saturday, the Trojans blew out UCLA. On Thursday, they creamed Arizona by 23 points; and this Saturday, they scraped out a 2-point win over Arizona State.
The Galen Center, the site of all three victories, was rocking by USC standards. If this keeps up, students may actually start caring about basketball. Following two losses to the Oregon schools on the road, USC has suddenly vaulted itself into the Pac-12 conversation with a 5-2 conference record, tied with Utah for second and trailing only undefeated Washington, whom the Trojans will play on Wednesday.
These were no “gimme” wins. UCLA and Arizona, for all their issues this season, are still loaded with talent. The Trojans wiped the floor with both of them. Arizona State was perhaps the Pac-12’s best chance for an at-large bid to the tournament after it handed then-top-ranked Kansas its first loss earlier this season. Not anymore.
Saturday’s win over the Sun Devils was arguably the Trojans’ most impressive of the season. The game was tight throughout, with USC clinching the win on a 3-pointer by senior forward Bennie Boatwright with 14 seconds on the clock. 
It was a well drawn-up play by head coach Andy Enfield and perfectly executed by a trio of veterans: Boatwright, redshirt junior guard Jonah Mathews and redshirt senior guard Derryck Thornton. Thornton, handling the ball, ran what was essentially a pick-and-pop with Boatwright at the top of the arc. Mathews also set a screen for Boatwright on the other side, freeing up the senior forward for an open look. And Boatwright, who Enfield referred to as the “MVP of our league” after the game, drilled it. 
Those are the kind of moments that not only win games, but also build the character and foundation of a good team. This is a completely different squad from the one that lost at Santa Clara last month for its fourth-straight defeat, after which Enfield, leaning against a crate outside the team’s locker room, said, “I don’t know what to say anymore.” He then called out the team’s veterans for poor decision-making. 
So here we were, a month later. Trailing by a point late in regulation, needing a basket, the veterans did not panic. Thornton, who has had problems with turnovers, calmly slid the ball to Boatwright. Mathews set the pick to perfection. And Boatwright, who missed a potential game-winning shot at Oregon State earlier this month, hit nothing but net. 
What’s more impressive is that the sequence came after a missed ASU free throw, and USC did not have a timeout. So Enfield, who had drawn up the play during a timeout prior to the missed free throw, trusted his players to execute on the fly. 
“Everyone knew what we were doing,” Enfield said. 
One can sense the positive energy that comes with victory. A month ago, this was a USC team that looked discombobulated, lacked confidence and most importantly, didn’t seem happy to be playing basketball. That can happen with a four-game losing streak. 
Now, this team is having fun. After the final buzzer sounded Saturday, a pumped-up Boatwright ran over to the student section to celebrate. Enfield looked the most excited he has ever been in his time at USC. 
The Trojans appear to be in perfect position to take advantage of the Pac-12 turmoil. The three teams they just beat are all among the Pac-12 favorites. Oregon, which was picked to win the conference preseason, seems out of the running following freshman center Bol Bol’s injury. If the Trojans put up a good showing in Seattle on Wednesday, they can make some noise in March and beyond. 
“The teams we just beat, these three teams, are very good basketball teams,” Enfield said. “They’re talented, they’re well-coached. So for USC basketball to beat UCLA, Arizona and Arizona State in three consecutive games — [I’m]very, very proud of these guys because they’re playing hard and they’re playing together.”
Enfield knew exactly what to say, and he could not stop praising his players. This is not the USC team that lost to Santa Clara. This is a USC team on a roll.

USC is creating a survey for students, faculty and staff in its first step to redraft the Code of Ethics, which aims to reflect the principles of the University while incorporating important topics from national discussions. 
The goal to redraft the Code of Ethics, which was last updated in February 2014, was set forth in the Action Plan released last semester by the University administration. Interim President Wanda Austin and Senior Vice President of the Office of Legal Affairs and Professionalism Carol Mauch Amir will spearhead the project, which is one of many Action Plan initiatives listed in USC’s Change Progress Dashboard. 
The code highlights two main ideals: respecting the rights of others and fulfilling University obligations transparently. It also lays forth a series of statements about the behavior that the University expects from its faculty, staff, students and trustees, including accomplishing University promises and speaking out against bigotry.
The University will use a Values Survey hosted by the Barrett Values Centre, which offers metrics to help organizations manage the culture of their environment. The centre will to reach out to students, faculty and staff regarding the values they would like to see incorporated into the redrafted Code of Ethics, according to Stacy Giwa, vice president of the Office of Ethics and Compliance. Giwa is co-managing the redrafting process along with Austin and Amir. 
“While we will lead that redrafting, the content will be driven with input from across the community,” Giwa said. “I’ll be accountable for pushing it along, getting that stakeholder input, and then developing an awareness campaign for the University.”
USC will lead engagement sessions in Fall 2019 after the Values Survey to gather input before redrafting the code as a resource for the community that will present more explicit measures for different situations, Giwa said.
“Think of the code as the vehicle by which we highlight our values and engage the community about how we all want to live those values and engage in ethical decision making,” she said.
Assistant professor of research radiology and pediatrics Jessica Wisnowski believes the redrafting of the code is important.
“We need to take a deep dive into both revisiting our own values and how we’re going to hold ourselves to those values, and how to make that work for everyone at this institution; for the students, for the faculty, for the staff, for the people who come here just to seek care,” Wisnowski said.
Caroline Liekweg, a freshman majoring in neuroscience, would like to see a Code of Ethics that can help with transitioning from high school to college.
“I think every school needs a Code of Ethics so that way people have some guidelines for what they should be following, especially when it comes to freshmen, because high school into college can be a big change,” Liekwig said. “Even though their ethics might be pretty similar, there can sometimes just be small little changes that can make a big difference.”
Evan Ho, a sophomore majoring in architecture, wants the University to rewrite its Code of Ethics more often in order to stay up to date with current events.
“Ethics and rules of conduct are constantly changing as people change, so should the rules that govern them,” Ho said. “I think that frequent and thorough redrafting of things like this is super important.”
The Office of Ethics and Compliance plans to interact with students, faculty and staff to research different avenues of communicating the code to the community once it is completed, Giwa said.
“Part of what we are doing now when we are looking at how we will engage around the values discussions themselves, is planning what are the right types of engagement avenues,” Giwa said. “They may differ for students, faculty and staff.”
According to the Action Plan, the new Code of Ethics will be sent out to all staff and faculty for acknowledgement upon completion..
The core information required to redraft the Code of Ethics is not expected to be completely collected until December 2019, Giwa said.

USC’s occupational therapy course, “THRIVE: Foundations of Well-Being,” is only in its second semester. But students and faculty hope the class, which teaches students self-care and time management, will become a staple for all incoming students. 
In collaboration with the Undergraduate Student Government, the Office of Campus Wellness and Crisis Intervention is planning to create more classes to help students manage stress, improve well-being and connect with the USC community.
Vice Provost for Campus Wellness and Crisis Intervention Varun Soni said he recognized a need to improve the social connections and well-being of USC students who have come to his office asking for help.
“I have noticed over the last five or six years how lonely students have become,” Soni said. “Even though we are in an age where everyone is connected to each other digitally, we are also in a time where people feel disconnected to each other interpersonally …  [These classes are] really a way to think about connection, friendship and community building, etc., because college is such a great opportunity to grow in one’s personal relationships.”
Varun and marketing professor Allen Weiss launched Mindful USC in September 2014 to offer classes to USC students, staff and faculty who wish to improve their individual well-being and interpersonal networks. 
The Mindfulness Lab, where Mindful USC offers five-week classes for one hour each week, was designed to create and incorporate effective and ongoing mindfulnesses practices in all aspects of life. 
“Mindfulness helps people get in contact with themselves to deal with the difficult emotions that they have, helps them deal with the difficult thinking that they have [and] helps them connect to other people,” said Weiss, a senior teacher at InsightLA, a mindfulness center in Los Angeles. “It is a way to meet other people and interact, so it decreases loneliness and the negative feelings that people have.”
Associate professor Ashley Uyeshiro Simon and assistant professor Kate Crowley from the Chan Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy teach an undergraduate course focused on recent developments in occupational therapy and occupational science. The course, called “THRIVE,” is a one-unit, no homework class for students to grow spiritually and establish friendships with peers. 
USG President Debbie Lee, a junior majoring in political science, said she encourages students to enroll in the class. She said she enjoyed the course last semester because it was broken down into beneficial topics like time management through which students were able to reflect on daily schedules and priorities. 
“When I was taking the course, what I found most impactful was being able to gain new perspective through discussion [about] big ideas, such as civility and spirituality, with other students,” Lee wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Additionally, I loved the practical piece incorporated into the course.” 
Because it is in its piloting phase, “THRIVE” is still being developed through collaboration from USG, the Office of Campus Wellness and Crisis Intervention and the Chan Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy. Students who take “THRIVE” this semester will be able to provide feedback on the course’s content and practices for students in the future. 
“We are doing all this program evaluation because we are literally shaping this course week-to-week based on student feedback,” Uyeshiro Simon said.  “We are certainly making a lot of change in the Fall of 2019 based on what people tell us is great and not so great based on this semester and last semester.
Uyeshiro Simon is encouraging students from all backgrounds including international students, veterans and students involved in cultural centers to enroll in a course to receive more diverse feedback from the student body.  
“If [“THRIVE”] is going to have the breadth and the reach that it needs to have, first of all, we really need student representation from all different areas of USC,” Uyeshiro Simon said. “Students should sign up for it now because … they are going to make a lasting impact at USC through their feedback in this course.” 
With the help of the Chan Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy, USG and the Office of Campus Wellness and Crisis Intervention, have begun to imagine a class that introduces all incoming students to the value of habits that increases the University’s well-being in general. 
Soni said he was interested in creating a course for incoming students with input from current students about what they wish they had known. “THRIVE” is one step towards realizing such a class in the future, he said. 
“We work with [USG] pretty extensively on this,” Soni said.  “It is in some ways a gift from students to new students. ‘[THRIVE]’ is a more ambitious curricular initiative. … There are some experiences and tools that we can provide to students in their first year, that will not just positively shape their well-being throughout college, but throughout their life.”
As a USG student representative, Lee hopes that “THRIVE” will benefit students as individuals, as well as the entire USC community. Lee said she believes it is an avenue for current and incoming students to thrive in their college career and life in beyond.
“‘THRIVE’ gives students the space to breathe, slow down and think about what thriving looks like in college and beyond,” Lee said. “ Take this course to grow as a person, build new perspective and form incredible friendships.”

Maxwell Brandon and Grayson Adler announced their candidacies for Undergraduate Student Government president and vice president, respectively, after their campaign’s approval last Thursday. 
Brandon, a junior majoring in accounting and business administration, is one of three presidential candidates, along with USG Sen. Michaela Murphy and USG Funding Chair Trenton Stone. 
“Once I saw the initial release of who the candidates were and … that there was only one ticket running for president, I thought that we at least needed to have some options,” Brandon said. “I contemplated for about a week and then decided to throw my hat in the ring.”
Brandon and Adler’s campaign points focus on improving sustainability, campus life, health and safety and Greek life, according to their platform published on the USG election website. They said USC no longer “wins” when it comes to achieving these goals. 
“Aside from athletics, we are having a lot of administrative issues [and] people on the row feel like the administration is slowly trying to get rid of Greek life,” Brandon said. “One of the most important parts of USC is the tradition … I like to think of Trojans as winners and now nothing seems to be going our way.”
Brandon said he does not believe that Murphy and Lane, who are currently USG Senators, represent all students on campus. He alleges that the current USG only represents the voices of students that share similar views with its members. 
“I have had my own conversations at senate meetings with [Murphy and Lane],” Brandon said. “I did not feel that they would be able to protect the interests of all students on campus.”
Brandon currently serves as the chairman for the USC chapter of Young Americans for Freedom, a conservative student organization on campus. YAF hosted conservative commentator Ben Shapiro in Bovard Auditorium in October, which prompted backlash and protest. 
Despite, YAF’s campus participation in politics, Brandon said he intends to run an apolitical and representative campaign. 
“I am going to try and keep my candidacy as apolitical as possible,” Brandon said. “I want to make sure all opinions of any Trojan are protected … If someone wanted to bring Mike Pence to campus to talk, I think they should be allowed to do that. If someone wanted to bring Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to campus, they should be allowed to do that too.”
Brandon and Adler have not served on USG prior to running; however, they consider their “outsider” status an advantage. 
“We are not insiders,” Brandon and Adler wrote in a joint statement published on the USG election website. “We feel the effects of USG policies just as much as you do. Even as your President and Vice President we will continue to hear your voices.”
Brandon admitted that though his lack of formal USG experience means he lacks a full understanding of USG processes, he believes his previous experience dealing with USG as YAF chairman has demonstrated how the organization can be improved. 
“I’m not in a bubble and I have dealt with USG as a student,” Brandon said. “I know what I want out of [USG] … so I feel like that gives me better insight to what the general population is thinking.”
Brandon hopes to expand green energy on campus, increase quality food sourcing for dining halls, dismiss the Student Health Fee and increase resources for victims of sexual assault and misconduct. 
Despite not being a part of Greek life, Brandon’s campaign also aims to restore the privilege of game day tailgates on Greek row and create a channel of communication between Greek letter organizations and the University administration. 
“While I recognize that there are many issues with Greek life organizations, I feel that there is value in having Greek life on campus, aside from tradition and ties alumni have.” Brandon said. “It would really be a disservice to not only to us but future alumni and future students if Greek life were to cease to exist.”
Brandon and Adler will participate in the USG presidential and vice presidential debate held in Wallis Annenberg Hall Monday.

Search the phrase “University must” on the ​Daily Trojan’​s website. In seconds, 1193 related articles pop up. Headlines like “University must address students’ alcohol use disorders” and “University should offer resources to improve financial literacy” are compelling, but USC is not obligated to implement additional resources when they already have resources to address said issues. 
It is unreasonable to ask for an expansion of resources when so many that USC offers are underused. Students should also be held responsible for seeking out resources when they need help or checking what’s available before asking for more.
Take, for instance, AlcoholEdu, a program that aims to educate students on safe drinking practices. I know many people — myself included — who mindlessly clicked through the course. It is ignorant to request that the University do more to combat student drinking when students themselves do not take USC’s resources seriously to begin with. 
Among students and in the Daily Trojan’s opinion section, another frequent request is the expansion of mental health resources. When my dad passed away in November, only​ one ​person recommended going to a USC-related therapist, with a disclaimer that the therapist was meant to provide relief to students in Greek life. I did not even look into the opportunity because it just created more work for me — I needed to look up the therapist, find where he or she practiced on campus, assess the status of his or her practice, carve out time for the meeting and take the time to ask if I, a non-Greek life member at the time, could even use this resource.
I would have happily spoken with a professional, but it was too troublesome to seek out a stranger at a busy and stressful time in my life. While I cannot speak for the entire USC community, I’ve never heard any of my peers speak candidly about the great support they have received from any of USC’s counseling measures. Students are not sharing the resources they have used.
It’s understandable that many students desire confidentiality in matters like mental health treatment, but the death of a loved one is just one example of an appropriate time for people to share what resources are available. USC needs to assess whether its resources are being used properly before even considering expanding certain departments within USC. 
Money that could be put toward underused resources should be diverted to ameliorate students’ daily issues — reducing the cost of tuition, increasing community security, funding clubs and organizations to reduce membership costs and offering stipends to students living in expensive off-campus residences due to the shortage of University housing. 
USC offers many valuable opportunities that most students are unaware of. Students tend to overlook the Language Center, the writing and math centers, Career Planning, Student Counseling Services and Sexual Assault Resource Center, among so many others. 
Another issue is that these resources have not been optimized to be truly useful to students. It is illogical to try and expand resources that are ineffective in their current states. 
“In spring 2018, I tried to use a registered dietician [at Engemann] to help get me out of a relatively serious eating disorder, but it took a couple months to even get to her because the health center has so much red tape … I had to jump through,” said Anora Denison, a junior majoring in English. “[The dietician] was good at her job, it was just really hard to actually access her.” 
That was Denison’s second attempt at accessing student resources — the first time was in Fall 2016 when she was denied mental health counseling because she was not deemed sick enough. 
“It was isolating and frustrating to have reached out and be turned down,” Denison said. 
One viable solution is to have the University host a resource fair to promote awareness of the many free services USC has to offer. 
With cost of attendance reaching over $75,000 per year, students should be making the most of their tuition dollars, and USC must continue to improve and better promote its existing resources before it makes any further expansions.

Driving in Los Angeles is a common grumble — it’s the start of many conversations and now a new chip on the table for city officials. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority has proposed imposing fees on drivers to curb congestion and decrease travel times. Despite the benefits that congestion pricing has for the environment and for drivers’ experiences in L.A., instating tolls is merely a temporary bandage — one that would harm those who cannot afford to pay without providing the resources necessary to counterbalance its ramifications.
In a sprawling city with rising housing costs that push people further from its core, and transportation infrastructure that does not support a growing population, driving is often the only realistic choice for commuters. Metro unreliability is just as common a hassle as traffic and for people who cannot afford to live where they work, the Metro’s limited reach is also a problem. The Los Angeles Times reported that though billions of dollars went toward improving public transit in 2016, Metro ridership continues to decrease every year. 
But  commuters cannot avoid both public transit and tolls. To do so would require more people to carpool or an expansion of highways to support more drivers. But neither of these alternatives are feasible solutions. Single riders on the 10 and 110 freeways are already paying tolls to drive in carpool lanes. It’s a system that benefits the wealthy and maintains the status quo for commuters who carpool. 
Carpooling has lost popularity because of ride-hailing apps, which have created more drivers in the effort to provide accessible travel. People who would not otherwise be driving are for the opportunity to make extra money. Despite the counterintuitiveness of this modern carpool system, people prefer it. I’ve turned to ride-hailing services like Lyft and Uber and car rental services like Maven over Metro for the convenience of traveling farther with a guaranteed arrival time — or the promise of compensation if that isn’t fulfilled. 
And there’s no room for L.A. to build more highways or scale back existing ones. City councilman Mike Bonin felt the wrath of Angelenos when they attempted to recall him after his traffic-causing idea: The 405 Freeway alternative route through Playa Del Rey was narrowed and several lanes became bike lanes. Though people initially supported the idea, having any fewer or more highways is impossible. Hasan Ikhrata, a former executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments told the Times, “We’re not adding any more freeways [in the L.A. area], period.”
The money from a driving tax would fund transportation in the long run, but it would also offer no immediate solution to our traffic problems. It’s a forward-looking plan that overlooks the present — Metro will conduct research on congestion pricing next month and looks to implement improvements over the next two years. But transit solutions to support commuters who struggle to pay toll fees won’t be around for another 10 years, as the city looks to improve its infrastructure for the 2028 Summer Olympics. But even with 28 new transportation projects planned,  Metro lacks $26.2 billion in funding to complete all of them.
Due to the uncertainty of the city’s transportation systems, it’s easy for politicians to make promises that don’t pan out in the long-term. With the turmoil in education casting a dark shadow on Mayor Eric Garcetti’s possible 2020 presidential campaign, it is likely that transportation will become a major issue for his successor, especially once constituents begin complaining about past plans’ shortcomings. 
There’s no easy way out of it. Transportation will always be a citywide struggle, and its effects on the community and the environment are hard to slow and impossible to reverse. Let’s just hope for the best that the upcoming tolls and freeway taxes will motivate increased carpooling, use of public transit and consciousness about the environment. That people who can’t afford a daily fee still find a timely way to commute. That lawmakers put the people they serve first and are resourceful with the infrastructure and assets L.A. already has. That innovation and better planning will create a more efficient, cleaner city that we call home.
