Shakespeare’s Macbeth will open Halloween night at USC’s Massman Theatre.  The play, produced by Independent Student Productions, takes a creative approach to Macbeth  by shifting the gender dynamics and presenting the play in a timeless setting. The director, Elisabeth Morgan, a senior majoring in theatre and English, drew inspiration from studying abroad in London. After working at the Globe Theatre, Morgan decided to emulate the “passion” of English Shakespearean theater by directing Macbeth at USC. Morgan has participated in Brand New Theatre and ISPs before but this is her first time directing a full-length ISP. Although USC’s School of Dramatic Arts puts on mainstage productions throughout the year, Lindsay Strongin, a senior communication major and actor in Morgan’s production of Macbeth, lamented the lack of Shakespearean campus. Calling herself “a Shakespeare person,” Strongin seized the opportunity to participate in this ISP.
As the name implies, ISPs are completely student-run productions that take place up to four times per semester. Potential directors can apply for grants from the Theatre Student Association or the School of Dramatic Arts ISP Grant, from the School of Dramatic Arts’ faculty ISP grant. Morgan chose the latter route and submitted a proposed budget, a plan detailing her vision and a production schedule to the faculty committee last spring. Strongin feels ISPs are a cocurricular activity equal to internships. Meghan Laughlin, internships and special programs coordinator at the School of Dramatic Arts, describes the process as “student-spearheaded” because of SDA’s limited involvement. Laughlin, Morgan and Strongin all agree that ISPs are truly student-run productions and students show a high level of professionalism and commitment. Laughlin noted that ISPs have more flexibility in genre, schedule and venue. For example, late-night shows are especially popular with ISPs and are well-attended by students.
The freedom and entrepreneurial nature of ISPs makes them ideal venues for students to gain production experience and become deeply involved in all aspects of theatre. Laughlin added that ISPs are a “great outlet” for students to explore encourage freshmen to “get involved, network and meet other students” through these productions. She noted that ISPs have “grown in popularity” in recent years and that the School of Dramatic Arts ”always love[s] to support its students.”
Unlike mainstage productions, ISPs welcome students from all majors and all class standings. This creates a different dynamic than mainstage productions — “we’re responsible for everything, no one can drop the ball … [since] there is no faculty program to fall back on,” remarked Strongin. Students get involved in every aspect of production and gain valuable expereience outside their majors.
Thus, successful ISPs must have a strong guiding vision and a committed core of students. Morgan describes her artistic intent as “intentionally minimalist” in order to evoke a sense of timelessness akin to Trevor Nunn’s productions. Instead of using lavish costumes or extensive scenery, Morgan keeps props to a minimum so that the audience can focus on Shakepeare’s language. Morgan noted that in Elizabethan times, people went to “hear” and not ”see” Shakespeare plays — highlighting the Bard’s “visual language.” Strongin also focuses on the importance of the language, adding: “Every once in a while, there will be a simple yet striking phrase amidst Shakespeare’s eloquence.”
Unlike the traditionally male-dominated Shakespearean theater, Morgan modifies the genders in Macbeth to include more female characters. By making Banquo, Lennox and Fleance female, Morgan shifts the dynamic of the play and adds more positive female characters to this Shakespearean tragedy. Strongin, who plays Banquo, feels that this adds “a new and interesting” complexity to Macbeth and Banquo’s relationship. Unlike the seductive Lady Macbeth and the eerie witches, Banquo provides a “strong, brave, level-headed woman” in Macbeth’s life. Morgan added that this gender switch contributes to the contemporary feel of her production.
Macbeth has a long tradition of theatrical superstition, making it the ideal Halloween play. Not only does this Shakespearean tragedy feature ghosts and witches, it also revolves around revenge and murder.
“This is not your typical five-hour Shakespeare play,” Strogin said. “It’s deliciously violent and perfectly relevant to Halloween.” Morgan capitalizes on the eerie aspects of the play by having an 11 p.m. showing on Nov. 1.
In addition to the supernatural aspects of the play, there is a pervasive superstition surrounding the play. According to popular theater lore, saying “Macbeth” in a theater space invites a curse and multiple forms of bad luck. Instead, actors refer to it as “the Scottish play” or “MacB.” Although she does not personally believe it, Strongin said, “People take it seriously and had to get comfortable saying [‘Macbeth’] in the theater.” Morgan feels that actors in “the Scottish play” are exempt from the rule. She credits the student actors and production team: “Things have been going smoothly.” ISPs rely on student participation, both in terms of production and audience.
“The audience is mostly friends and family … We don’t advertise, we just rely on Facebook.” Morgan ncourages students to attend this “tale of sound and fury.”

If one’s ever heard of Robert Glasper, they’ve probably heard something about him singlehandedly saving jazz music from extinction, waking black musicians out of their stupor, or any number of other equally hyperbolic nuggets of rhetoric. While it may not achieve all of these lofty goals, there is no denying that with Black Radio 2, the Houston-born prodigy has succeeded. Yet again, he assembles unique voices from disparate corners of pop, jazz, blues, R&B and hip-hop into a hypnotizing sonic mosaic.

Especially after 2012’s Black Radio won a Grammy for Best R&B Album, it seems that a great deal of expectations for the future of jazz were placed on Glasper’s shoulders. Perhaps this is also due to the lack of other well-known contemporary artists in the genre. Juxtaposed with jazz musicians’ typical obsession with the past, the fresh take of Black Radio 2 exists essentially in a musical vacuum. One has to look no further than this summer’s Newport Jazz Festival, which was headlined by the 80-year-old Wayne Shorter, to see evidence of this.
The only problem with trying to see this record as a new direction for jazz music is that it is not a jazz record. Glasper himself said in an interview with The New York Observer, “This one is pretty much an R&B solo record with sprinkles of jazz here and there.” This is an oversimplified, but accurate description of Black Radio 2. Fans of previous Glasper albums such as Double Booked and Canvas hoping for a return to bebop scales and extended instrumentals should look elsewhere. Fans of groovy, love-making R&B, however, will not be disappointed. Tracks such as “You’re My Everything,” a soulful duet with vocals from Bilal and Jazmine Sullivan, harken back to ’90s R&B such as R. Kelly and D’Angelo.
The lack of jazz influence isn’t the only noticeable change on the sequel. On the first Black Radio, saxophonist Casey Benjamin’s (over)use of vocoder on almost every track was a very polarizing component. The vocoder is much less present on the new album, and when it is there, it feels much more tasteful. In keeping with this mentality of less is more, this record features only a single cover song, compared to four or five on the first album. The Experiment takes on Bill Withers’ “Lovely Day” as the closer to the album. It was originally intended to be used only as a sound check. Because of this, it features nearly every musician appearing on the album and feels like an appropriate closer.
While these changes benefitted the overall aesthetic, this is not the case for every change that was made. One of the best parts of Black Radio is missing this time around, and that is the drumming of Chris “Daddy” Dave, who was unavailable due to touring with his own group. One of the most unique talents in drumming today, Dave blends his gospel chops with complicated jazz time changes and uses his mastery of time to come in just ahead of or behind the beat. There are very few drummers who play even remotely similarly to him. Thankfully, Mark Colenburg, Dave’s stand-in for the album, is one of those drummers. Although Colenburg also has impressive chops and technical abilities, they are barely utilized. The music calls mostly for a simple, steady backbeat. The exception to this rule is the tantalizing “Let It Ride.” This song pairs up the smooth, airy vocals of Norah Jones with a relentless, driving drum and bass beat. The result is the most cohesive, interesting track of the entire recording.
With their Grammy nod in 2012, Robert Glasper Experiment acts such as Bon Iver in the club of Grammy winners who are still somehow outsiders. Rather than following in Bon Iver frontman Justin Vernon’s footsteps and beguiling his success, however, Robert Glasper is glad that he has been given a platform from which he can spread his message of “real music,” replacing what is heard on the radio. This is all well and good, but tracks such as “I Stand Alone” seem to beat the listener over the head with this message. The title says it all: Everyone is a cookie-cutter except for me. I stand alone. It even concludes with a voice-over by author Michael Eric Dyson lamenting musicians who are “satisfied with mimicking the popular, rather than mining the fertile veins of creativity.” This may be true, but stating it outright repeatedly feels slightly contrived. Too many times, the  listener is being told as opposed to being shown.
It’s not all serious, though. There are moments when the activism subsides and gives way to humor, such as Wayne Brady’s hilarious voicemail in which he freestyles and impersonates Erykah Badu. This was a tasteful injection of fun, but there are other attempts at humor that fall flat. One such moment occurs in the opening track, “Baby Tonight (Black Radio 2 Theme Song/Mic Check 2).” Like the opener of the first record, we are introduced to the wide variety of featured artists through their speaking, scatting, singing and rapping over a sparse piano vamp. Fall Out Boy frontman Patrick Stump already sticks out like a sore thumb on the lineup of features, and only further exacerbates this incongruity by singing in a mocking voice, “This is Patrick Stump and I never get to do shit like this.” The only other appearance made by Stump occurs on the track “I Stand Alone,” an anti-pop ode to individuality. The irony of featuring Stump, a former tween-pop/punk icon who has recently forayed into plain old pop, makes it hard to take the message seriously.
That being said, the highest level of virtuosic skill and instrumental mastery can be expected from anything to which Glasper attaches his name. On that front, this recording doesn’t disappoint. Whether or not the group’s statements about the stagnation of popular music are valid, there is no questioning their playing abilities. And, really, that is what it’s all about. He could have all the guest features in the world, but without a pre-existing concept and sound, none of them would be effective. Glasper came into the recording process with such a framework, and as a result, the album succeeds. Although it doesn’t measure up to the original, Black Radio 2 is a solid record that deserves the praise and hype surrounding it.
