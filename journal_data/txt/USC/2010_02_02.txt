The days of waiting anxiously in line as students count out their coins at various campus eateries might now be over thanks to the recent implementation of credit card machines at venues around campus.
Charge it · LiteraTea is the latest USC Hospitality venue to add credit card capabilities, after Café 84 added machines earlier this month. Hospitality hopes the increasing number of credit card machines around campus will make these venues more accessible. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
The gradual implementation of credit card machines took another step forward last week with the addition of credit card capabilities to LiteraTea. Credit card machines were also added to Café 84 at the beginning of the month as part of a larger renovation to the facility.
Director of USC Hospitality Kris Klinger said the new credit card option was added at these locations because of requests from students and faculty.
“There were quite a few people who were questioning if we accepted credit cards,” Klinger said. He added that people would sometimes leave when they discovered that a certain location did not take credit cards.
LiteraTea and Café 84 were two of the final steps in the gradual addition of credit card machines across campus, Klinger said. Trojan Grounds and The Lot added the option of paying with credit cards earlier this year.
This was a gradual process, Klinger said, because of the amount of resources and money it takes to add new features to USC Hospitality facilities.
“It’s about resources and getting them in place,” Klinger said, noting that registers are approximately $3,500 each, while credit card machines are about $500 each.
Klinger said sales were already being affected by these changes.
“The sales at both LiteraTea and [Café] 84 have increased since we brought in credit cards,” Klinger said. He noted, however, that the increase might also be a result of the new products that have been introduced, not just the new payment system.
Despite the new credit card capabilities, Klinger said that most people still pay with their USCards because of the convenience of doing so and that both dining dollars and discretionary are by far the most popular payment method on campus.
Across campus, the general consensus is that students are happy about the new option of paying with credit cards.
Ann Austria, a junior majoring in communication, said she usually pays with her credit card or USCard and said she finds it a hassle when certain eating locations do not have the credit card payment option.
“Sometimes I don’t have cash on me so I want to use my credit card,” Austria said. “Having to go to an ATM and getting cash and then going to go eat is sometimes an inconvenience.”
Dan Darwish, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience, said he does not own a credit card but that most of his friends prefer paying by credit card to paying in cash.
“Whenever I go with friends to places they always pay in credit card only,” Darwish said. “They don’t use a lot of cash.”
Adriana Granados, a junior majoring in psychology, said her decision about where to eat on campus is often affected by whether or not the location takes credit card. Also, the speed with which the transaction is processed is very important to her.
“There are places in The Lot where it takes forever to pay with credit card,” said Granados, adding that she prefers The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf because of its quick transaction time.

This is something you might expect from John Deere, not Nikon. In what would appear to be an honest mistake, the face-detection technology in the popular Nikon Coolpix series cameras has been programmed in such a way as to interpret certain races’ eyes as blinking eyes. When the Wangs, a Taiwanese family that recently purchased a Nikon camera, attempted to take a family photo on Mother’s Day, their new Coolpix S630 consistently displayed a prompt reading “Did someone blink?” after each consecutive photo was taken. The message persisted until one of the children took a picture of himself with his eyes opened as wide as possible, at which point the message not longer appeared.
It’s hard not to cry ‘racism’ when technology commits such a grievous oversight of the beautiful variety of human faces. That a Japanese company was behind the blunder is even more curious, but that detail should in no way increase or lessen the gravity of the glitch. After all, that’s all this is: a glitch. Facial recognition technology is in its earliest stages, and you can be sure that Nikon will have corrected this kink in all subsequent manifestations of the programming. The technology is definitely a net positive: for amateur photographers like myself, auto-focus and similar conveniences will make a world of difference when snapping pictures of friends and family. Until the technology is perfected, however, I don’t think it’s overly sensitive to turn the setting off on any Coolpix you may already own: what’s the use in treading on toes with your camera’s faulty features (Ashton Kutcher-endorsed or not)?

Another non-conference home match, another victory for the No. 1 USC men’s tennis team (5-0, 0-0).
On Monday, the Trojans swept UC Irvine (3-2, 0-0) 7-0, as the Anteaters became the fifth opposing squad to fall short at Marks Tennis Stadium this season.
Victory· Freshman JT Sundling won in straight sets on Tuesday.  - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
The depth of the USC lineup was on display, as the Trojans received contributions from a number of players.
On this day, USC coach Peter Smith was finally able to use the doubles lineup he had anticipated to use at the beginning of the season.
All three pairs won fairly easily as sophomores Daniel Nguyen and Steve Johnson paired up at No.1, senior Robert Farah and freshman JT Sundling played in the second position and juniors Peter Lucassen and Jaak Poldma finished out the doubles lineup.
Players said being familiar with other members of the team has helped them adjust to any changes smoothly.
“[Switching partners] is not really a problem, if I do my part, my partner will do the same,” Nguyen explained. “I’m used to playing with these guys all of the time.”
In singles play, several players displayed a strong competitive spirit in coming back from some early deficits.
After winning the first set 6-4, No. 65 Sundling found himself down one break at 1-4 in the second. He wound up winning six of the next seven games to close out the decisive set over sophomore Steven Henderson, in his first singles appearance of the year.
No. 1 Steve Johnson, playing in the second singles position, also found himself trailing  against the animated sophomore Sam Gould. Johnson overcame the break and went on to win 6-2, 6-4.
No. 14 Farah, playing No. 1 singles for the first time this season, hit the shot of the day in his 6-2, 6-4 defeat of sophomore Fabian Matthews.
Matthews connected on a deep passing shot, and as Farah approached the ball — with his back facing the net — he hit the ball between his legs and lobbed it over Matthew’s head for a winner.
Smith had planned all along to flip Johnson’s and Farah’s singles positions and felt that there should not be too much made of player’s lineup positions.
“They are going to be constantly switching throughout the year, they’re both great players,” Smith said.
In the other matches, Lucassen displayed his strong baseline play in his straight-set triumph, and Smith lauded No. 47 sophomore Matt Kecki’s “strong sustained effort” in his 7-5, 6-2 victory over junior Stephen Stege.
With the rest of the team cheering on in support, No. 116 Poldma pulled through in a tough three setter against senior Shimpei Suzuki, finishing off the match with a 5-7, 7-6 (5), 1-0 (10-7) win.
In evaluating the overall performance of his team, Smith described the adversity his players faced.
“We experienced some letdowns in the second set, but our players all finished strong,” Smith said.
Following the ITA Kick-Off Championship last weekend, the team might have faced a bit of a letdown, but the concerted effort to win all of yesterday’s matches is a mark of a truly mature and championship-caliber team.

It’s finally here.
It’s the day when chiseled, egotistical high school seniors all over the country honor the 51st anniversary of Buddy Holly’s tragic death by taking a few lines out of Don McLean’s “American Pie.” 
And I knew if I had my chance / That I could make those people dance / And maybe they’d be happy for a while.
Of course, I’m talking about signing day.
Today is the day when five-star, four-star — sometimes even no-star (as you’ll see later) — recruits take their chance in the spotlight and announce the school they will be attending, setting off dance parties in college coaches’ offices around the country.
Nevermind that probably 90 percent of those football recruits who will sit in front of one, two or 10 television cameras and don the hat of the school that schmoozed him have never heard a Buddy Holly song.
Who needs Buddy Holly when you have coaches tooting a prized recruit’s horn and trumpeting that school’s fight song around the living room?
These ego-inflating tactics contribute to the overarching pompous atmosphere of signing day. And it’s a day we could do without.
ESPN cameras decorate the family rooms and high school gyms of athletes who haven’t proven anything except the fact that they are bigger and more athletic than most 18-year-olds. It makes the athletes feel like royalty — see Derric Evans, who, in 1989, signed his letter of intent in a hot tub with a glass of wine in one hand and a pen in the other — and creates hype that sometimes isn’t there.
Take former Trojan Joe McKnight and current USC redshirt sophomore running back Marc Tyler for example.
Coming out of high school, McKnight and Tyler were the two best running backs in the nation. McKnight, dubbed by many as “the next Reggie Bush,” created controversy on signing day by spurning the hometown Tigers of LSU for the out-of-state Trojans. People were ready to crown the Trojans as national champions on signing day. Yet, it took two years for him to get over that moniker, and Tyler, after various injuries, still has yet to play to his potential. The fact that those two were ranked one and two means nothing right now.
Signing day also has the possiblity of creating false hope.
Just take a look at Kevin Hart. Remember him? He was the guy from Fernley High School in Nevada who announced, in front of a packed high school gym and television cameras, he was going to play football for Jeff Tedford and the California Golden Bears.
Except there was one problem.
Cal never recruited him. Nobody did. He told himself he wanted to play Division I football. When it became apparent that there was no school offering him a scholarship, he got caught up in all the signing day hoopla and decided to offer himself one.
He’s now at a junior college trying to move on from all the national media attention and scrutiny he received as a result of the lie.
Signing day has become the first step in taking the student out of “student athlete.”
Think about it. Some of these high school seniors make their announcements during the middle of the day on a Wednesday. What else is in the middle of a weekday? Oh yea, class. It’s become more important to tell people where you will be going to school instead of trying to stay in it.
Sure, some people might say it’s a day to celebrate all the hard work that the teenager has put in. But isn’t that what senior day, typically the last home football game of the year, is for? Or graduation?
I say, do away with the press conferences and the attention. Have an athlete announce his decision on a website like most entertainers do.
You don’t see Bruce Springsteen putting on an “I Love N.Y.” T-shirt at a press conference when announcing the first stop of his tour. Or the Monstars pulling out a map of the galaxy and pinning a dart on Earth in front of assembled media.
In fact, get rid of signing day altogether. Many people were upset a few years ago when Terrelle Pryor held a press conference on signing day announcing, well, that he hadn’t made a decision and wouldn’t for a few weeks.
I wish more recruits were like Pryor. He wanted to finish basketball season, enjoy senior year and not rush the process.
So, with signing day here, don’t take too much stock in it. Championships are won on the field, not on a piece of paper. Many high profile recruits don’t pan out and many lower ones become stars.
Yes, Trojan fans should be excited about having Kyle Prater and Dillon Baxter on campus, but we’ll find out about the incoming class of 2014 soon enough — on the field.
Hopefully the music doesn’t die, and they can make us happy for a while.

UCLA is ranked 8th according to Rivals, I think ‘SC might be upstaged. Our days are numbered.
Great story Kenny! I agree 100%
People need to stop putting these athletes on pedestals. THEY ARE JUST PEOPLE. People that just happen to know how to throw a football or make awesome catches that result in game-winning touchdowns.
I’m not going to lie, I do enjoy going to a school with a top-tier football program, but at the end of the day I’m in school to LEARN. I could care less about who’s signing what where.
Wow, the jealousy just rolls off of the page. I think I got some on my shirt sleeve.
That’s why you don’t count your chickens before the eggs hatch.
man…is the writer jealous or what??
You are kidding right?
You say the kids are egotistical, you ought to take a good look in the mirror, son.
You need to check your ego, because you have done nothing that warrants your attititude.
June…you are kidding…right? Grow up

In collegiate sports, it is rare to find a regular-season matchup showcasing the two top teams in the country. These types of marquee matches are normally saved for primetime television or late-round tournament games.
Tough test· Junior setter Riley McKibbin will help lead USC against Cal State Northridge, recently given the nation’s top ranking. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
Though as the No. 2 USC men’s volleyball team (6-2, 4-1) travels tonight to the Metadome to face the newly-crowned No. 1 team in the land, the Cal State Northridge Matadors (8-1, 5-1), there will be no championships at stake, no ESPN camera crews and no late-night exposure. And while the final result may not leave the victor with a trophy or ticker-tape parade, no match this season has held as much importance as tonight’s showdown between these two Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference foes.
The Trojans, who previously were ranked No. 1 in the country, enter tonight’s match in Stockton, Calif. in what simply can be described as unfamiliar territory. Last Friday, they led No. 11 Pepperdine 2-1, with an 18-14 lead in the fourth set, when the wheels on what looked to be an emphatic road win came off. The Waves rattled off a 12-6 run to win the set, and then carried that momentum in to the final set, en route to a 15-10 victory.
The match not only ended USC’s perfect conference record, but it stripped the team of its standing as the nation’s elite. While the team has had several statement victories over top teams including UC Irvine, Ohio State, UCLA and Long Beach State, all of their previous success means little without a victory over the Matadors — a team this group of players has had trouble with during their time at USC.
“Our team hates losing as much as we enjoy winning,” senior middle blocker Hunter Current said. “We have been able to overcome pressure situations in previous matches, so we are looking to prove the same against Northridge.”
While the Trojans were left searching for answers this past week, Northridge had arguably its best two performances of the season. The Matadors, behind senior leader opposite Theo Edwards and sophomore setter and assist leader Matt Stork, convincingly swept Pacific in three sets and upset previously second-ranked Stanford in a five-set stunner.
CSUN will enter tonight’s 7 p.m. tussle with the Trojans in a bit of unfamiliar territory as well. The team’s 8-1 record is the best in school history — a history that has featured only one appearance in the NCAA final, back in 1993.
Yet, while the chips may be stacked against the Trojans as they look to reclaim the top spot, many of the players are drawing on a motivational message they received from a guest speaker last season — former USC football head coach Pete Carroll.
“He told us when you are playing a top-ranked team, a lot of guys think they have to play at a higher level to win the game,” junior setter Riley McKibbin said. “That’s when players tend to make some unreal plays but, more often than not, make mistakes.”
McKibbin believes if the team can follow Carroll’s words and play consistent despite the level of competition they may be facing, the outcome will end favorably for the battle-tested Trojans.

Recently, Billy Corgan announced that his seminal ’90s band the Smashing Pumpkins would be releasing its first album since their 2007 comeback, Zeitgeist. This time, however, the lead singer has shed the only other founding member — drummer Jimmy Chamberlin — and is soldiering on as the sole remaining tie to the original Smashing Pumpkins.
The fool · The 44 songs on Teargarden by Kaleidyscope are inspired by Tarot cards and their characters. Above, watercolor album artwork. - Photo courtesy of TheSmashingPumpkins.com 
The new album — whimsically titled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope — not only features a new drummer, 19–year–old Mike Byrne, but a new deployment scheme. While 2000’s Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music was subversively distributed online, it was mostly a plot to undermine Virgin Records’ unwillingness to give the Pumpkins a double album. Kaleidyscope, on the other hand, is being released as part of a web-based project that Corgan describes in several interviews as a way to bypass the process by which art is made and delivered.
The 44-song concept album, which is still being written, will be distributed digitally — one song at a time — until there is enough to realize Corgan’s vision of an 11 EP box set. More importantly, Corgan’s plan includes infinite amounts of no-strings-attached song downloading directly from the band’s official website.
Thankfully, the two songs that have been released so far are a positive introduction. “Widow Wake My Mind” sounds like Corgan’s more upbeat work with his side project Zwan and “Song For A Son,” which seems like a boring ballad at first, eventually layers guitars beautifully and a pretty awesome guitar solo.
Although the songs don’t resemble those sun–kissed, nostalgic songs of the Pumpkins’ earlier work (“Today,” “Soma,” “Crush”) or their songs that, quite frankly, rock (“Siva,” “Geek U.S.A.”), there’s no doubt that Corgan is still a very talented songwriter and some of his great harmonies are still apparent. But with only two songs released since Dec. 8 (the second arrived on Jan. 18) the entire experiment could take years to culminate.
Despite the fact that this is an experimental form of releasing music, Corgan’s complex history as the driving force behind the Smashing Pumpkins has prepared him. When Corgan brought the Smashing Pumpkins together in 1988, he expressed that he wanted the band to be his own artistic vision. He brought in James Iha, D’arcy Wretzky and Jimmy Chamberlin as bandmates, but their presence has long been regarded as a façade of cool ’90s diversity that masked Corgan’s one-man show. Corgan not only wrote all the music for the band, but it has been rumored he snuck into the studio at night and re-recorded over the others’ parts. Corgan’s control over the band can’t be denied and it’s debatable whether or not the Smashing Pumpkins were ever really a band, an argument that rings even more true now. Corgan has acknowledged this dilemma, writing on his blog that the band is “just a name, THE Smashing Pumpkins.”
Despite questions to the Pumpkins’ current validity, however, Corgan’s exclusively downloadable release could be extremely successful, partly because Corgan embraced the Internet so early on. After the band officially broke up in 2000, Corgan took its album underground. Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music was released by giving 25 vinyl copies to friends and prominent fans,  complete with permission and instructions for online redistribution. A decade later, with the height of Corgan’s career far behind him, it might just be his current low profile that allows him to again be successful with the Internet in a way that artists trying to reach their peak could only hope for.
Regardless of whether Corgan’s new releases are successful or a total failure, at least a few people will be paying attention to the Pumpkins’ next move because of the intrigue. The story of the band’s career is one filled with huge success (Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, Siamese Dream), backstabbing (Corgan publicly declared that he hated his fellow Pumpkins) and major pitfalls (drug abuse, depression, Corgan’s embarrassing blogs). And with a 44-song box set being created at this moment, it can only get more interesting.
Terrific article!  Informative, concise, and topically newsworthy,  Bravo, Ms. Geoghan.
This is really something to look forward to-‘one song at a time’…  I didn’t know about this. A whole new way of distributing music, bypassing the middle men, it sounds like.   And songs based on Tarot Cards??  It is ‘intriguing’!
Really great article. Thanks! Will be watching and waiting for the rest to come out.
Awsome article!  Go Corgan! Life always has yet another chapter to write.

The No. 16 USC men’s golf team returns today to the site of their last victory to tee off their spring season, competing against a strong field at the Mauna Lani Invitational on the big island of Hawaii.

The last time the Trojans played a tournament on the Waikoloa Country Club course, a year ago this week, they cruised to an 11-shot victory.
Three All-Americans are gone from that winning five-man lineup, however, and fourth-year coach Chris Zambri will trot out a lineup of two juniors, a sophomore and two freshmen this week against some of the best teams in the nation.
“Every week we show up, I feel like we can win the golf tournament, but maybe those expectations are a little high for this group right now,” Zambri said about his young roster. “Although I think by the end of this year I really feel we can be that kind of team.”
During the fall season, USC posted finishes of eighth, seventh, fourth and sixth in the four tournaments they entered. The results, while enough to earn USC a national ranking, were not what Zambri had come to expect from his program.
“I felt like we could have played a lot better than we did in the fall,” Zambri said. “I don’t think anybody really played the way that I feel like they can play, other than Steve Lim, who had two events where he was quite solid.”
One Trojan who fell short of early season expectations was junior Matt Giles, a native Australian that held the No. 1 individual ranking in the country for a long stretch last season and was named a PING First Team All-American.
Giles struggled to replicate those results during the fall semester, finishing in the top 10 individually in only one of the four tournaments he entered.
“I struggled in the fall because I wasn’t working as hard as I knew I had to be,” Giles said.
Giles said he spent the break fixing the areas of his game he needed to improve and is ready to perform during the spring.
“My game feels quite good — I’m really excited with the boys to get back into the swing of things,” Giles said.
Lim posted the best finish of any Trojan during the fall with a tie for third place at The Prestige in October.
“The way he can play golf, there’s no reason he couldn’t be one of the elite players in college,” Zambri said of the sophomore Lim. “When he gets himself in position to do something big like win a golf tournament, I’m looking forward to seeing how he handles that.”
Three freshmen started for the Trojans in all four of the fall team tournaments. Sam Smith and Martin Trainer will be in the lineup in Hawaii, while the most heralded freshman coming out of high school — T.J. Vogel — will not play this week.
“Martin is a very good ball striker and Sam’s strength is his length and he can putt,” Zambri said about his freshmen. “I expect T.J. to settle in pretty soon here and really become a big contributor because he’s a pretty special player.”
Redshirt junior Bo DeHuff will round out the lineup for the Trojans this week, while freshman Stewart Hagestad will compete as an individual.
“The par 5’s are very attackable, so that will be a big part to our success,” DeHuff said about the Waikoloa Country Club course. “Our team is a pretty long hitting team so we have to come out of there with birdies.”
The field at the Mauna Lani Invitational is one of the strongest of any tournament this spring, with 11 of the top 20 teams in the country in Hawaii, including No. 1 Oklahoma State and No. 2 Stanford.
“We love to compete and we want to play against the best because that’s how you find out how good you are,” DeHuff said. “So it won’t be any surprise when we step up to the first tee at the national championship [and] we’re paired with a couple of the other best teams in the country.”
The tournament begins today and play will conclude with the final round on Friday.

Hip-hop arose from a combination of the popular genres of the late ’70s and early ’80s and has undoubtedly been influenced by rock ‘n’ roll over its lifespan, so the concept of combining hip-hop and rock ‘n’ roll is hardly a novel idea.

While there have been many isolated attempts to bridge the two genres, bands — especially throughout the ’90s — popularized a combination of the two. Rap-rock utilizes rapping over loud guitars and live drum kits. Apart from bands such as Rage Against the Machine and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, however, the rap-rock genre is often mocked or dismissed by the rest of the music community.
On Rebirth, Lil Wayne’s newest full-length studio album, however, he attempts his own version of the historically difficult relationship between rap and rock. Wayne has long toyed with the incorporation of rock elements in his music, including the integration of guitars into his songs and live act over the years.
On Rebirth, however, rock is not there to supplement the rap, it’s the main focus. Wayne trades his typical flow over beats and synths for loud guitar riffs, pounding drums and a multitude of Auto-Tuned crooning. The result is strange, which is an adjective that is not uncommon when discussing Lil Wayne.
Rebirth is considered a rock album, but the unconventional style of many songs makes it seem as if Lil Wayne doesn’t understand what contemporary rock is.
True rock fans, then, might be quick to criticize Lil Wayne’s complete lack of understanding for the genre, as the background tracks on Rebirth often sound like cheap imitations of newer, popular rock music and were undoubtedly crafted to be more easily digestible to Lil Wayne’s already established mainstream and hip-hop audience. But the interesting thing isn’t that Lil Wayne failed at making a rock album, it’s that he invented a whole new style of rock in the process.
Some might argue that Lil Wayne is only attempting to recreate the success of previous rap-rock artists or make money off of a new gimmick, it’s undeniable that Lil Wayne’s fusion of the two genres — which includes a combination of heavily Auto-Tuned singing, rapping, raspy yelping, guitar riffs, live drums and hip-hop beats — is unlike anything heard before.
This originality, however, is not necessarily a good thing. Many of the songs on the album are incredibly cheesy. For instance, “Paradice,” Lil Wayne’s attempt at a power ballad, consists of slow, pounding drums similar to Tha Carter III’s rock-influenced “Shoot Me Down,” but with less rapping and more overdramatic Auto-Tuned singing.
Lyrics such as The sun don’t shine forever, Everything that glitters ain’t gold and Love don’t love forever sound hilariously cheesy as Lil Wayne sings over a soaring background track.
The lyrics on the rest of the album are equally as disappointing. Part of Lil’ Wayne’s draw has always been his knack for effortlessly creating complex and clever lyrics, but, on Rebirth, the lyrics lack as much depth and originality as the guitar riffs on many of the songs.
On “Da Da Da,” for instance, the chorus consists solely of Lil Wayne mumbling the nonsensical title of the song over and over again, demonstrating a clear lack of lyrical complexity. During “Knockout,” a melodic pop-punk song that eerily recalls early Blink-182, Wayne sings simple, cheesy rhymes such as Are you into black men? / Hey Barbie, I could be your black Ken that do nothing other than make the listener laugh at the ridiculousness of the song. The album’s lyrical high point comes not from Lil Wayne himself, but occurs during Eminem’s guest verse at the end of the more rap-influenced “Drop the World.”
Despite the cheesy nature of the songs and the relative lack of lyrical complexity, however, Rebirth is undeniably catchy. “On Fire,” one of the album’s singles, heavily samples a song from the Scarface soundtrack and, upon first listen, sounds like a disposable ’80s popular rock song. The track, much like many of the other songs on the album, has an uncanny ability to be stuck in the listener’s head for hours.
The same is true for “One Way Trip,” a song featuring Kevin Rudolf and Travis Barker, two other artists that have a history of combining and collaborating with both rock and rap musicians. The song has a star-studded line-up filled with talented musicians but ultimately lacks any exciting display of that talent. Still, like “On Fire,” the song has a catchy hook and is somewhat memorable.
Thus, Rebirth is not entirely a failure. The songs may not truly grasp the essence of rock ‘n’ roll music or allow Lil’ Wayne to fully demonstrate his lyrical ability, but they are still unique, original and somewhat catchy. As a one-time experiment with the rock genre, Rebirth works. But true Lil Wayne fans should only hope that Weezy drops the guitar, listens to his peer Jay-Z’s advice and stops using Auto-Tune, and returns to rapping on his next album.
While I understand that Lil’ Wayne’s Rebirth was sub-par at best, your critique of the album clearly shows that you listened only once to each song. To say that he lacks lyrical complexity based on a few lines of a few songs is entirely bogus. And i find it funny that you didn’t talk about any of the stand out songs such as “Drop the World” and “Runnin'” and “Prom Queen” in more depth. Some of Lil’ Wayne’s best lines since the Carter II are in “Drop the World” and i completely disagree about Eminem outshining in this song. Hmmm bottom line: listen to the CD again.

Maybe it is the icy winds of L.A. winter, but Yogurtland seems a bit lonelier these days. Could it be that frozen yogurt — back from the dead after its ’80s heyday thanks to Korean fro-yo chains — is another fading trend? 
You needn’t look far to find one potential heir to the frosty throne. It’s right under Tommy Trojan’s nose. While balancing schoolwork and fraternity activities, Michael Malyn, a sophomore majoring in business administration, has created his own icy concoction known as Whips. What’s more, he’s cooked up a plan to make it big.
What’s a Whip? It’s fruit and nothing else. Using a special curing and freezing technique, Malyn has created an all-fruit sweet treat that resembles a lovechild of sorbet and soft serve.
“At the ice cream store I worked at over the summer, the owners would make [something similar] for us,” Malyn said. “I took a spin off of it and tried to create my own version. People are into health food in L.A. more than where I’m from, so I thought there was a market for it.”
Marketing his creation is a hurdle Malyn has taken after like the business major he is. So far, he has used his friends, Facebook and Trousdale to show off the product.
“I’m actually sponsoring the Southern California Business Film Festival,” Malyn said. “I’m going to be there selling samples and stuff. I’m [also] trying to get a table at the farmers’ market on campus. I’ve been inspired by the way Pinkberry’s done it — they never paid a dime for advertising. All of their stuff was really word of mouth. I think if they can do it, I can do it.”
But the catch about word of mouth advertising is, of course, the need for a good product. After sampling the icy confection, this frozen-treat fanatic can say there is no need to worry.
The first Whip I tried was strawberry-banana — Malyn’s professed favorite. Bananas are sacred in the vegan world for their creamy, dairy-replacing magic, and in Whips they are no different. Though the only ingredients are in the flavor’s title, the banana gives the treat the consistency of a thick soft serve.
The second flavor, melon, is closer to sorbet in texture but is still very thick. As they are sans sugar, there is no need to lick any cloying sweetness off your lips, and the fruity taste is pure and refreshing. The banana gives its flavors a better consistency, but, if you like the non-blended counterparts, any Whip would make a satisfying snack or dessert.
Other fruits Malyn has used include blueberries, peaches and kiwi. He has also played with açai berries and pomegranates, as part of a potential antioxidant line. Usually, he just goes to Ralphs grocery store and experiments with whatever fruits are in season.
“It’s just fruit, which is the awesome thing about it,” Malyn said. “There are no more calories than what’s in the fruit, and no artificial sweeteners or anything. The secret is the way I ripen the fruit. I cure it and freeze it and put it through a restaurant-quality blender to make it come out with the fro-yo consistency.”
Because Whips have no dairy, gluten or soy, they are safe for those with intolerances or allergies. Since they lack refined sugar, diabetics can worry less about blood sugar spikes. Whips are also the answer to faux-fruity indulgences such as Jamba Juice, whose Razzmatazz flavor serves up 74 grams of sugar along with the free calcium boost.
“People don’t realize Jamba Juice uses these bases that have all these added calories and added sugars,” Malyn said. “I take the approach that you can have something that’s yummy and good for you.”
Ultimately, Malyn wants to open his own Whips shop — if interest continues to grow as he hopes. As a business administration major, he knows how critical it is to gather enough interest before making such an investment, and he knows he’s not quite there yet. This summer, he plans to introduce Los Angeles to his unique product and take the slow and steady course toward his ultimate goal. But Malyn still hopes to open a store while he is in college, and his friends are there to help.
“One of my friends volunteered to wear a banana suit,” Malyn said, “but I’m really taking it one step at a time.”
If Whips were to catch on, Malyn would not be the first USC kid to take the food world by storm. Lara Merriken, who graduated in 1986, went on to create LäraBars — which makes close to $20 million per year. So if you pass by the Whips table on Trousdale one day, try them out. The next time you see it, it could be well beyond free-sample status.
“I don’t think I’ll take down Pinkberry,” Malyn said, “but I think I can carve out a niche.”
Mimi Honeycutt is a sophomore majoring in print journalism. Her column “Gingersnaps” runs Wednesdays.
Because of dairy allergies, long ago I discovered that any soft fruit could be cut up, frozen for a couple of hours, and then whipped up in the blender with a little cold water, depending on the consistency desired. I use an old vita-mix, which is strong and quick, but any regular blender should do okay. Mine are milk shake consistency without any milk – just the fruit. Honeydew melons make a tasty shake all by themselves. Peaches or nectarines likewise. Never thought of blending more than one fruit together, though, since I was looking for different foods to eat each day rather than mixing different types. Also didn’t try to get it to soft-serve ice cream consistency, but the recipe books that came with the vita-mix suggest this is possible also. It’s a great idea for peddling to people without a blender handy, though, especially if it’s kept non-dairy so people who can’t eat ice cream can enjoy it. Also using just fruit should keep it high fiber, which is a plus for many people If you can eat the fruit, then you can substitute Whips with no nutritional hit.
Nestle has a really good frozen strawberry lemonade, comes in 12 oz cups (3 servings). Must really load it with the strawberries because it has a lot more fiber than expected. But other than some frozen fruit bars and banana pops (half a frozen banana coated in chocolate), that’s the only mainstream item I’ve noticed in our stores that comes close to the Whips, which unlike the others has nothing else but fruit and sounds a lot more interesting. I’ll be waiting for the franchise to hit Indiana…

As a rule, romantic comedies are nothing but big phonies. They portray happy couples experiencing whirlwind emotions of love, but viewers are inevitably forced to return to their own depressing realties. When it’s all said and done, a romantic comedy isn’t all that different from an outright fantasy.
Amore · Josh Duhamel and Kristen Bell star in When In Rome. - Photos courtesy of Walt Disney Pictures 
Even with this all-too-familiar fact in mind, When in Rome — Disney’s most recent attempt at the genre — pulls audiences into the story and leaves them wishing that real-life love could be like the story developing on screen in front of them.
Kristen Bell plays Beth, a successful art curator, who — like most rom-com protagonists — is unlucky, unwilling and untrusting when it comes to love. Beth’s Roman holiday begins when she jumps on a plane to the Italian capital for her sister’s wedding. Among the beautiful Pantheon, Coliseum and Piazza Navona lays the most important monument in the film: the Fountain of Love.
None of these sights seem to catch Beth’s gaze until the clumsy and tall — but extremely charming — best man Nick (Josh Duhamel) walks through the church doors.
Save for a few awkward encounters, the night seems to be going smoothly until Beth decides to cheat the magic of love and steal people’s coins from the fountain. In Beth’s battle to keep away from three hilariously weird men — all of whom fell in love with her because of a vaguely described enchantment — she ends up pushing away the most important people in her life.
When in Rome follows the formulaic story line of most romance movies: A problem is followed by further catastrophe that pleasantly transforms into a happily-ever-after. But as long as you don’t go in expecting the unexpected, Bell, Duhamel and the rest of the cast do a good job of dazzling and entertaining.
Bell’s sweet and strong portrayal of Beth makes her relatable, while Duhamel’s sexy and helplessly romantic act has female hearts swimming in all directions. In fact, the casting is one of the best parts of this film. Without Napoleon Dynamite’s Jon Heder and comedians Will Arnett, Dax Shepard and the unforgettable Danny DeVito, the movie would not have achieved the same measure of pleasantly uncomfortable humor. Each of the four men brings his own dimension of creepy awkwardness to the film. Most alarming was Heder’s neverending and extremely obscure magic tricks. His ways of wooing were blatantly unattractive, but he remained confident in his “skill.”
Viewers can expect to burst out laughing a few times throughout the movie, with a couple of giggles sprinkled in-between. When in Rome executes the objective of comedy successfully; certain scenes are quite original and freshly entertaining. The creators fully exploited their arsenal of physical comedy, so expect to see a lot of clumsy trips and hits.
All the same, certain scenes had audiences scratching their heads. When in Rome reminds audiences that cheesiness is the foundation of the romantic comedy (recall Nick’s “The only spell I’m under is you” gem from the teaser trailers). One wonders if screenwriters expect audiences to believe that couples really spew these sappy sayings at a moment’s whim.
Like most films, When in Rome has lessons to be learned. Along with watching beautiful Italians, DeVito crammed in a yellow clown car and the inspiring model for a lasting relationship, hopefully the audience takes away a few hints for leading a fulfilling life. The film suggests that people should avoid the tendencies to be a workaholic, constantly uptight and overly judgmental at any cost.
But the simple lesson at the heart of When In Rome is the encouragement of love for others. Whether it be for friends or significant others, the film implies that standing by another person’s side is far more important than actually discovering true romance.
To hell with the depressing reality of romantic comedies.Audiences will enjoy some chuckles, learn the potency of a few highly sentimental, highly effective catchphrases and forget that the story of Beth and Nick will most likely never apply to them.

Looking over the runway at Baghdad International Airport, one might see the signs of a nation returning to normalcy as a green and white painted Boeing 737 with the name “Iraqi Airways” touches down from a flight only to quickly refuel and carry passengers to Basra. Another flight takes off on the other end — it’s a Turkish Airlines flight heading to Istanbul while a Gulf Air plane taxis after coming in from Dubai.

As demonstrated by the increase in the number of airline flights both domestically and internationally, Iraq is taking the first steps to fly away from the perception of a war-torn nation. Being able to travel freely around the world is something relatively new to Iraqis as flights out of Iraq have not existed since 1990 after sanctions stemming from Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait. Very few flights began even after the 2003 U.S. invasion because of heavy fighting.
Flights serve various Iraqi cities, including Baghdad, Najaf, Mosul, Basra and Erbil. Carriers including Austrian Airlines, Middle East Airlines and Bahrain Air connect Iraqis to international cities such as Cairo, Beirut, Damascus, Tehran and Vienna, thereby allowing Iraqi citizens to freely travel and leave their country legally.
Turkish Airlines Chief Executive Temel Kotil called Iraq a “good market” in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Jan. 27 while Iraqi Airways spokesperson Abir Burhan said “anything that connects Iraq to the rest of the world is good for the carrier and the country as a whole.” Other airlines such as Lufthansa and Qatar Airways are seriously thinking about beginning flights to Iraq as well.
One might begin to wonder if it safe to have commercial airlines flying from, and over, Iraq? Isn’t there a security threat? The quick answer to this is yes, but the threat level is manageable enough to fly relatively safely. Arriving flights do not stay at the airport for long before taking off in order to minimize time for rocket attacks and other threats. The airport control towers are not as modern as control towers in other nations, but the government is also trying to invest more money in modernizing its airport facilities.
The real reason why the Iraqi government is willing to take the risk in starting commercial flights to and from Iraq is because international travel is considered to be a sign of a normalcy — an indicator of a nation well connected to the rest of the world. By being accessible to foreign travelers, Iraq can bring in more foreign investors who see Iraq as an untapped market for various products and services. By having more investors in Iraq, the nation will begin to build its infrastructure and take a big step in becoming not only a functional nation but a successful one.
Some critics allege the government is taking a risk in inviting international carriers to Iraq. They argue that the competition for customers between international airlines will drive them away from flying on the national carrier, Iraqi Airways, thus decreasing profits to a government that desperately needs alternative sources of revenue. The threat to profits is especially potent when competing with low budget airlines that are springing up throughout the Middle East.
The greater risk involved in allowing international carriers to fly is the threat of a terrorist attack against a plane or airport.
As mentioned above, the government seems to believe it can handle the security threat by being more vigilant A terrorist strike, however, would be a huge blow to Iraq’s chances of foreign investment and travel as foreign companies would not consider Iraq a nation ready for stable economic growth. This notion would delay further revenue for the government and push the nation farther back into international economic isolation.
Despite the threats involved in inviting international carriers to Iraq, the Iraqi government is doing the right thing by taking this necessary step toward modernizing the nation. The government considers itself to be capable enough to handle the security issues inherent in air travel, and a stable security record could legitimize the government in the eyes of both the Iraqi people and foreign investors.
Iraq is flying its way out of misery and into a land of progress and modernization.
Let’s hope it sticks to the flight plan.

Have you ever been that person in the social situation who doesn’t know what to do or how to interact, so you pull out your cell phone and pretend to text someone? Or maybe you actually text someone just to not feel totally inadequate.
According to a report by the CTIA: The Wireless Association, mobile users sent an average of 4.1 billion text messages every day. That is almost 1.5 trillion text messages in the entire year. The average number of daily Tweets reported was 27.3 million. 
But while the social media boom is clearly on its upswing, real life social skills are ironically falling off in dramatic fashion.
Usually, when I walk on campus, I smile and nod at people, greeting them as I pass. Not all notice. But most of the ones that do notice find it quite weird. It’s even worse when I say something like “Hello.”
Sometimes I wonder how we actually make friends without liquid courage.
Every so often, Zac Hampton, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering, will perform an experiment on campus. All day, he will smile at everyone he passes within reasonable distance. In his past experiences, he’s received very few smiles in return. As a joyful and attractive man, it was definitely not his appearance scaring people.
Trevor Smith, a junior majoring in screenwriting, has noticed something similar. As a former Spirit Leader, he will occasionally extend a “Fight on!” to people he encounters on campus only to endure looks that seem to ask “Are you crazy?!” Our USC tour guides must be falsely advertising when they tell people that students constantly greet each other with this Trojan battle cry.
Frequently, I get a Facebook friend request from someone I have just met, or someone that saw me across a room, or someone I’ve never seen or heard of in my life.
Sometimes it is just that, a friend request to solidify our “friendship” as “official.” Other times, this ceremonial friendship betrothing results in some awkward electronic conversation or an attempt at one at least.
I wonder to myself: Why hasn’t this person ever talked to me like real people talk? I know I’m not the only one to encounter such unconventional social skills.
Betsy Avila | Daily Trojan
Then there is Twitter, which is just another electronic excuse for us to lack social dexterity. “Grocery shopping.” “Finally found a table in the Lot.” Or worse yet: “Drink number one at the 9-0.” Quickly followed by: “Drink number two at the 9-0” in some infinite loop as if in between drinks the tweeter masquerades his lack of human interaction by mass texting some absurdly boring message.
We read these messages (that we really don’t care to read) because, when we have our face in our phones, we are excused from relating with people in our physical presence.
Just last week, I was eating in a restaurant and all four people at the table next to me were silent and staring at their napkins. After a mild double-take, I realized they were all texting. The only time I heard noise from their table was ordering, eating, drinking and a chuckle after one read aloud a moderately funny message.
Cell phones are to us what books were to unsocial “book nerds.” Except for some reason cell phones are more socially acceptable.
In the beginning of the cell phone era, it was unmannerly to use a cell phone in the presence of people unless it was an emergency call. The reason was simple: Human relationships in the moment are more important than any detached electronic connection.
These social mediums are great for keeping in contact with people we do not get to see on a regular basis. But we have allowed them to kill our ability to intermingle, even to the point of relying completely on alcohol.
There used to be a time when constant social interaction defined society. People cared more for each other because they talked to each other, even strangers. In fact, some of the most life-changing conversations I have had were with complete strangers willing to respond to my greeting and be vulnerable.
Etiquette was not some set of rules that made us strut pompously. Rather, it was a set of guidelines, which made for effective, efficient and real relationships that went beyond complaining about homework, test difficulty or football.
A few lessons in etiquette along with an increased desire to actually know people will take our socializing capabilities a long way while making our USC community interconnected on a deeper level than any mass electronic message could possibly do.

“All I’m saying is that sometimes a 140 character message is more effective than having a chat over a cup of coffee.” 
Good communication is cogent, not loquacious. Hell no I won’t facebook you, I don’t want you to write a novel on my wall, LOL!
I write this on my blackberry while sitting at dinner with a few friends who are all either texting, tweeting or writing on someone’s facebook wall. 
I’m not offended by them. 
As the director of social media for a political consulting firm, social media has brought a new level of social interaction to a 24/7 world. From protests in Iran to relief for Haiti, social media has been invaluable to keep the world connected. And yes, the boring facebook status still has meaning to someone. 
I’m not sure exactly when a stranger, precipitously greeting people at random was returned in kind except in a black and white movie where married couples slept in separated twin beds. 
Its quite self absorbed to assume that our undivided attention should be limited to those who are conveniently around. I love the fact that I can know what my colleague is reading in Idaho, or that my friend just got a new car in Texas, or how I can help orphans in Haiti in less than 140 characters.  
We live in a big world and technology like social media allows that world to become ever smaller. We are no longer constrained by distance or random chance meeting. 
What I do not understand is your ideal? How should I keep in contact with those not directly in front of me? Call? Write a letter? Maybe a fax? That’s simply technology a generation ago.  A lot of partisanship occurs because sides can’t understand the other. If you want to understand them, read their blogs, check their facebook posts. Just because you disagree with the medium, doesn’t take away from the effect. Social media is more effective hands down.
As technology expands, so does social interaction.
As much as I’d love to have dinner or share an elevator ride with all my friends; in an economy rocked by failed stimulus and uncertainty regarding double digit unemployment, all aspects of our lives have to be more compact and efficient. That includes social interaction which allows people to keep in contact with several people with less time and effort with richer, more instant information. 
Social media is a testament of our expanded social interaction because we now can keep in efficiently close contact with several people who otherwise I would never see or hear from again. And even met new people. 
One person named Haley from Orange County, I talked to via twitter for several months, even occasionally a wall post. Then we met during a tweet-up that she organized. I tweeted a few months ago about how my friend was suddenly struck with cancer and a church in Oregon contacted me about how they could pray for her. Would you consider that a limitation of social interaction when one is expanding their social base? 
Am I saying we should cut off all personal interaction? By no means! All I’m saying is that sometimes a 140 character message is more effective than having a chat over a cup of coffee.

It’s been a busy day in Hollwood Land, with the nominations for the 2010 Academy Awards announced this morning before sunrise. Now the whole city is a-Twitter (literally) with predictions over who will take the big gold statues home from the Oscars on March 7. Not to be left out, I have compiled my own list of comments and judgements about the potential future winners:
Best Motion Picture of the Year:
 Avatar
 The Blind Side
 District 9
 An Education
 The Hurt Locker
 Inglourious Basterds
 Precious
 A Serious Man
 Up
 Up in the Air
This is the most exciting category for a number of reasons. For one, it’s Best Picture, only the biggest prize a movie could ever hope to achieve. Two, the list has expanded from the traditional five nominees to ten, with some surprise nods as a result. Avatar, Inglourious Basterds, Precious, The Hurt Locker, and Up In the Air were all shoo-ins (see: the nominees for Best Director). The list was expanded to give little art gems a shot at some recognition, which is where A Serious Man and An Education fit in (though no one but some film buffs saw them… I was one of three people in the theater when I went to see An Education). The big box-office draws (District 9, The Blind Side, Up) this year also got noticed, but fan favorites Star Trek, The Hangover, and the Michael Jackson tribute This Is It all got snubbed (though Star Trek got some nods for technical achievements).
I’m going to call it right now: the award’s going to Avatar. It’s breaking records left and right, it won the Golden Globe, it’s from Oscar fave James Cameron, and it’s all anyone can talk about in Tinsel Town these days. It’s a great movie, to be sure — whether or not it deserves the award is up for debate.
Achievement in Directing:
James Cameron, Avatar
Kathryn Bigelow, The Hurt Locker
Quentin Tarantino, Inglourious Basterds
Lee Daniels, Precious
Jason Reitman, Up in the Air
Oscar history demonstrates that the Academy likes to give the Best Director award to the director of the Best Picture (come on… it just makes sense). But I’d like to see this one go to Quentin Tarantino, for a work of true artistic vision.
Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role:
Jeff Bridges, Crazy Heart
George Clooney, Up in the Air
Colin Firth, A Single Man
Morgan Freeman, Invictus
Jeremy Renner, The Hurt Locker
This one is Jeff Bridges’. Might as well mail him the Oscar now.
Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role:
Matt Damon, Invictus
Woody Harrelson, The Messenger
Christopher Plummer, The Last Station
Stanley Tucci, The Lovely Bones
Christoph Waltz, Inglourious Basterds
Everyone’s betting on Christoph Waltz for his astounding turn in Inglourious Basterds. But I would like to see this one go to Woody Harrelson, whose work in The Messenger will make you forget all about Zombieland.
Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role:
Sandra Bullock, The Blind Side
Helen Mirren, The Last Station
Carey Mulligan, An Education
Gabourey Sidibe, Precious
Meryl Streep, Julie & Julia
The Academy loves Meryl Streep, but Gabourey Sidibe deserves to finally win something. Who’s harder to play: Julia Childs or raped, inner-city teenage mother? Please.
Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role:
Penélope Cruz, Nine
Vera Farmiga, Up in the Air
Maggie Gyllenhaal, Crazy Heart
Anna Kendrick, Up in the Air
Mo’Nique, Precious
And the award goes to… Mo’Nique (as it should). But who decided Penélope Cruz deserved a nomination?! Did anyone see Nine?! It was laughable. Penélope Cruz was the only good thing in that movie, but she stole the nomination slot from the far more deserving Julianne Moore in A Single Man.
Best Animated Feature Film of the Year:
 Coraline
 Fantastic Mr. Fox
 The Princess and the Frog
 The Secret of Kells
 Up
This category should just be renamed “Best Pixar Film of the Year.”
Original Screenplay:
 The Hurt Locker, Mark Boal
 Inglourious Basterds, Quentin Tarantino
 The Messenger, Alessandro Camon and Oren Moverman
 A Serious Man, Joel Coen and Ethan Coen
 Up, Pete Docter, Tom McCarthy and Bob Peterson
All are amazing scripts, which is exciting considering the amount of drivel that tends to grace the silver screen (even Avatar was a bit cringe-worthy at times), so it’s a tough one to call. But I’m going to bet on Tarantino, just because he is so freakishly original.
Adapted Screenplay:
 District 9, Neill Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell
 An Education, Nick Hornby
 In the Loop, Jesse Armstrong, Simon Blackwell, Armando Iannucci and Tony Roche
 Precious, Geoffrey Fletcher
 Up in the Air, Jason Reitman and Sheldon Turner
Another tough one, but Up In the Air has to win something… so this one will go to Reitman and Turner.
As for the rest of the categories, let’s be honest: No one cares. However, my nerdy side rejoiced when I learned that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince got a nod for Cinematography. Take that, Twilight!

Departing seniors safety Taylor Mays, running back Stafon Johnson, tight end Anthony McCoy and receiver Damian Williams highlight a list of 11 former Trojan football players who have been invited to the NFL’s Scouting Combine, held Feb. 24 to March 2.
The Combine, which is held annually in Indianapolis, Ind, is the NFL’s best talent show for draft-eligible college football players. Scouts from all 30 NFL teams will be in attendance to watch hundreds of players perform a variety of tests and skill challenges over the course of the six-day event.
Mays, Johnson, McCoy and offensive linemen Charles Brown and Jeff Byers all had the chance to impress the scouts already, as all five were invited to the Senior Bowl, but the Combine will be a chance to test themselves against the entire 2010 draft class.
Eight seniors had already received invitations earlier this month from the NFL, but juniors who declared for the draft received their invitations yesterday. Departing juniors defensive end Everson Griffen, wide receiver Damian Williams and running back Joe McKnight have all received invitations from the NFL.
Offensive lineman Alex Parsons, and defensive backs Josh Pinkard and Kevin Thomas round out the 11 invitations, joining a group of more than 300 invites that will be critiqued and analyzed by an expected scouting crowd of more than 600 NFL executives.

A group of USC students has created what they hope will be the newest fad in social networking.
Cubicl.com, created by students Andrew Lee and Rory Handel along with two other non-USC students, facilitates streamlined communication and idea sharing.
Cubicl allows users to post text, pictures, videos or links within group conversations known as “cubes.” The cubes are meant to allow for easy communication and can be used to share files or information for group projects.
Cubicl launched Feb. 1, and already includes iPhone and Blackberry applications.
