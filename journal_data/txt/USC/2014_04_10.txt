Former Annenberg Dean Geoffrey Cowan invited acclaimed journalist Todd Purdum to celebrate the upcoming publication of Purdum’s latest book, An Idea Whose Time Has Come: Two Presidents, Two Parties and the Battle for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 at the University Club Thursday evening.

Purdum spoke about the major themes in his book, which analyzes the Civil Rights Act, passed 50 years ago.
“Before I started my research, I thought I knew a fair amount of the Civil Rights Act,” Purdum said. “But the broad outlines of what I thought I knew were only part of the story, and that was the less interesting part of the story.”
Purdum discussed the way in which the Civil Rights Act was passed, and the role of factors such as secrecy and an interfaith coalition. He also mentioned the role of key players preceding this time, notably Lyndon B. Johnson.
“I think what was so interesting about Johnson and what he does was that he was a contradiction,” said audience member Beverly               Morgan-Sandoz. “He was a man from the South, deep in the southern traditions which were not pro-African American, and then it’s him who signs this legislation that finishes what Lincoln started.”
Purdum explained that what was most important about Johnson was his ability to restrain himself from intervening too much. He then stressed that there are many overlooked figures involved in the Civil Rights Movement.
“Some people are totally forgotten when it comes to this story,” he said. “For example, Representative William McCulloch. He was very conservative, but he said that if they promise not to water down the bill and give Republicans equal credit, he would bring the republicans along — and that’s exactly what he did.”
McCulloch was critical in forcing the Republicans to break the filibuster, but his role is not usually remembered.
About 30 audience members attended the event, participating in a Q&A session with Purdum.
“The book is a fascinating history of one of the most important pieces of social and political legislation,” said Michael Parks, director of the School of Journalism. “I covered some of this news as a journalist and when reading this, I learned things that are worth knowing as an object lesson for America today. Our current political system is so messed up that we need to look back in history, and the way things were done.”
Richard Reeves, a senior lecturer at Annenberg, noted he agreed with much of Purdum’s discussion.
“I think a good deal of Todd, and [I had] already read the book,” Reeves said. “We agree on a lot of things, particularly what he said about Kennedy’s 1963 speech was unique. The fact that the president would publicly side with the minority changed America.”
Michael Alexander, who runs a free concert series looking at the history of racism in Los Angeles, also attended the event out of interest for the topic.
“I am old enough to have lived through it,” he said. “I am worried that your generation is not as active as mine was.”
Alexander also spoke about the often-overlooked history of civil rights in Los Angeles.
“In 1950, my father sat in his car on alert because a black family moved north of Pico,” Alexander said. “I also remember the big issue when a black singer moved to Hancock Park. So L.A. is working towards a model of inclusiveness, but its history is tainted and not recognized.”

That was Lyndon Johnson. 
Andrew Johnson was Abraham Lincoln’s Vice President.
Both men did become president after a president was assassinated. 
Andrew Johnson was the first POTUS to be impeached. The Senate acquitted him. He was later the only former POTUS to serve in the Senate.

On Thursday, the USC  International Relations Undergraduate Association hosted a panel discussing the United States’ renewed engagement with Iran, “US-Iran Relations: Into a New Era,” featuring Muhammad Sahimi, chair of the National Iranian Oil Company and professor of chemical engineering and materials science at the Viterbi School of Engineering.

The event was hosted in conjunction with USC Model United Nations and the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and moderated by student Luke Phillips of MUNSC. Other panelists included USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences undergraduate students Shikhar Gupta and Mustafa Zaffer, both of MUN.
Sahimi began the discussion with a background on the tenuous relationship between the United States and Iran over the issue of Iran’s nuclear program. He stated that though Iran’s nuclear program was initially supported by the United States under President Dwight Eisenhower’s “Atoms for Peace” program, the new Iranian government  ended nuclear activities after the 1979 Iranian Revolution.
Sahimi gave a personal anecdote about how the politics of the time affected his own studies in the United States.
“I came actually to this country with a promised scholarship from the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran,” Sahimi said. “I came here to study to get my Ph.D. and go back to work for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. But when I came to this country, it was fall of 1978, and that was just when the Iranian Revolution was gathering steam. So in February of 1979, the Iranian government overthrew the regime of the Shah and I never got my scholarship.”
Sahimi shared a candid view on the sometimes-controversial rhetoric from current Iranian leaders.
“Mahmoud Ahmadinejad [the former president of Iran] was a radical,” Sahimi said. “He started using very fierce and hot rhetoric against the West, and talked about— stupidly, I must say — Israel, and he denied historical facts like the Holocaust.”
Phillips asked Sahimi about the international community’s assertions that Iran intends to develop nuclear weapons. Iran has claimed that its program is for peaceful purposes only.
“These are not things that one can talk about with 100 percent  certainty,” Sahimi said. “If someone put a gun to my head and said, ‘Would you guarantee with 100 percent  certainty that Iran never used its nuclear technology to research or develop nuclear weapons?’ I would say, ‘Pull the trigger,’ because I cannot guarantee it.”
Sahimi maintained, however, that though Iran might have had a nuclear weapons program in the past, current reports suggest that there is no proof of such a program in place.
“All evidence suggests that Iran actually never took any practical steps to develop nuclear weapons,” he said.
The panelists suggested that the nuclear issue may be tied to hegemony in the Middle East.
“I think other countries around Iran have been voicing their opinion, to the U.S. especially, that if Iran is capable towards going to a nuclear bomb, would that not start an arms race? If Iran needs a bomb, it’s in the case of deterrents to Israel,” Zaffer said.
Gupta agreed and stated that Iran and Israel were engaged in power politics within the region.
“Iran has a lot to offer with such a young and educated populace with vast natural resources,” Gupta said.
He also believed that economic issues played a role in the Iran-Israel relationship.
“Should Iran become a country that has gotten western legitimacy, then that would be a lot for Israel to worry about,” Gupta said. “Because with all that present in Iran, that would mean the U.S. would start investing money [in] Iran and that would mean money pulled away from the large amount of investment in Israel.”
Andre Gray, a freshman majoring in economics (mathematics) and international relations, was interested in potential economic effects in the region.
“Something I found particularly interesting was the discussion on economic stability of the Middle East and especially the contributions of countries like Saudi Arabia who are worried about bettering relations between Iran and the U.S., and how that could potentially lead to more competition in terms of natural resources like oil in the marketplace,” Gray said.
Jack Cannice, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law, stated that he was doubtful about some of the issues discussed.
“It was interesting how the professor took his viewpoint that there wasn’t really any credibility to the nuclear threat,” Cannice said. “I’m not entirely sure that’s true, because I did read in my IR class last year that [the Iranian government] had more nuclear centrifuges developed that they could ever possibly want for just clean energy. I didn’t agree with everything, but it was enlightening.”

This weekend, the University of Southern California will host the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books for the fourth year in a row.
Book’n it · Last year’s Los Angeles Times Festival of Books drew over 150,000 attendees. The festival returns this weekend and will be hosting a wide array of celebrity authors and live music and reading events. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
Since its inception in 1996, the festival — which brands itself as an “annual celebration of ideas, creativity, and the written word” — has continued to grow. The festival now draws over 150,000 attendees as well as authors such as T.C. Boyle, John Green, B.J. Novak,  Katherine Schwarzenegger, Alicia Silverstone and Rachel Zoe.
Aside from celebrity authors, events will include live music and readings, art and photo galleries and cooking demonstrations.
Margo Brown, an undecided freshman, said she is looking forward to experiencing the event for the first time.
“I am most excited to meet and listen to some of my favorite authors speak,” Brown said. “It’s an incredible opportunity to have access to an event of this magnitude.”
There is an important new feature being incorporated into the festival this year — the Los Angeles Times “Inspire Us” contest. The event called for any local musicians, artists, poets, photographers and comedians to enter for a chance to win an appearance on stage. Those lucky winners will get to perform on one of the many stages set up around USC’s campus.
Other additions include the Artist’s Row, featuring a select group of artists creating installations live on-site as well as a Los Angeles Times pop-up photo gallery.
Erica Dominguez, a junior majoring in fine arts, noted this year’s festival is an especially unique event.
“It is going to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience to see these emerging artists at work and pursuing something I one day hope to do,” Dominguez said.
Furthermore, this year’s festival will be debuting “Festival After Dark,” extending its hours to show a live performance of American Public Media’s Wits. The popular radio program will be taping in Bovard Auditorium on Saturday, April 12 at 8 p.m. Host John Moe will be joined by special guests Margaret Cho, band Superchunk and Will Scheff for a night of laughs, music and more.
This year will also feature some of Los Angeles’ favorite food trucks such as Crepe’n Around and The Recess Lunch Truck in addition to Cuban, Indian and Asian cuisine. These will be located off of Downey Way in the parking lot.
The addition of these new events has defined the festival’s growth since its move to USC from UCLA four years ago. Author and USC professor T.C. Boyle said he prefers having the festival on the USC campus.
“The feel of the fest is more intimate here, whereas at UCLA things were far too spread out and the overall feel was more exclusive and cold,” Boyle said. “The USC venue seems to make it much more [of] a community celebration.”
Boyle, author of Stories II, will be attending the festival to perform on Sunday at 3 p.m., where he will present a new short story of his.
“I hope the audiences reconnect with the notion of enjoying literature, rather than seeing it as something reserved for classrooms and assignments,” Boyle said. “I hope that the younger members of said audiences will be gratified — if not startled — to see that some of the people who write the books they read are still alive and breathing.”
USC professor of history Deborah Harkness stressed the merits of the festival’s mission to advance the vitality of literature.
“I hope that authors and readers alike see that the reports of the death of the book have been greatly exaggerated,” Harkness said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “When thousands of people — including children and their parents — come to the [Los Angeles Times Festival,] it seems to me that the book is very much alive.”

Australian electronica musician Chet Faker drops his debut album, Built On Glass, April 15, moving beyond the body of Internet-mixes-only electronic artists showcased on platforms such as Hype Machine and SoundCloud.
Oh, Chet · Australian singer-songwriter Chet Faker employs soulful, jazzy, James Blake-esque sounds, with unique production in his upcoming electronica album Built on Glass – available April 15. – Photo courtesy of Together Boston
Faker’s first album is a successful venture, showcasing his style and leaving listeners wanting more.
Built On Glass begins understated and mellow, the tonal hits setting a soft jazz mood for the beginning of the album.
From the first strains of the vocals on “Release Your Problems,” the soulful, expressive mood of the album blooms, making the point from the very beginning that this isn’t your typical electronic album.
The overlapping, lightly handled strains of saxophone on “Talk is Cheap,” the single released off the album, speak to Faker’s at-times delicate handling of jazz melodies and tonal compositions.
The brilliantly composed track, oscillates between the sweet, soulful aspects of the backing saxes. This element brings to mind the delicate, wavering soul of James Blake, known for the emotional rises in the vocals and the hard-hitting beats in the background.
Rather than creating a wall of sound that constantly pushes against the listener, Faker is more invested in creating a backdrop of beats and subdued melodies through which the vocals strain for release, painting a sonic portrait of longing and love.
The majority of the production on the album is well-handled and tightly controlled, surprising listeners with melodic details that keep the movement of the album vibrant.
It becomes clear to the listener as the album progresses that Faker’s tracks aren’t simply for listening, but for swaying and dancing to.
“Melt,” featuring Kilo Kish, combines scatting elements with rich vocal ranges found within the music of many other electronic artists such as Nicolas Jaar and alt-J.
For those familiar with the work of these other musicians, Built On Glass might call into question whether Faker’s work is original enough to merit serious investment.
Though Faker does draw on many similar arrangements, tonal characteristics and jazz influences shared by other electronica artists, these similarities do not detract from how enjoyable the album is.
Additionally, there is enough unique production and vocal elements in the album to promise many more surprises from Chet Faker in future productions.
It is toward the middle of the album when some weaknesses begin to detract from the compositions.
Vocals begin to verge on the edges of the singer-songwriter genre, with the vocal sweeps beginning to hint at the mainstream trappings of adult contemporary. The excellent production, however, manages to save the more mediocre tracks, and Faker thankfully moves beyond the sentimental in the second half of the album.
Divided by a spoken section that announces “side two” of the album, distortion begins to seep into Faker’s tracks, and that’s when the listener knows that Faker isn’t quite done with the surprises on the album.
The vocals begin to overlap and delay, and the mellowness at the beginning of the album gives way to a more experimental, hard vibe on “side two.”
Production choices surprise listeners and continue to develop the album with twists and turns.
Once the bass drops on the track “1998,” Built On Glass turns into a full-blown dance party.
Faker still isn’t free from his weaker moments on the album, with the track “Cigarettes & Loneliness” getting bogged down in the repetition without having much to offer the listener.
The end of the album, however, finishes on just the right note to keep listeners hitting the play button over and over again.
The album ends without vocals, but with a more heavy-handed approach than the beginning of the album.
“Lesson In Patience” is contemplative and moody, getting into a heavier use of tones than the rest of the album. It pushes the limit of what Faker’s exploration of mood can do, and promises to be fruitful ground for exploring Faker’s capabilities as an electronica musician.
The last track on the album, “Dead Body,” goes back to Faker’s soul roots, with the track slowing down and drawing heavily from R&B.
The slow, swinging beats are just the kind of late-night rhythms one would find on an R&B and electronica fusion track, and stand out as just one end of the emotional spectrum that Faker explores on Built On Glass.
The bluesy electric guitar solo at the very end of the album is the perfect way to tie together an album that spent so much time deconstructing soul and jazz influences and exploring them within the context of electronic beats and melodies.
As the music winds down, so does the listener, and Built On Glass is a promising start to Chet Faker’s sure-to-be eclectic discography.
In the end, Built On Glass emerges as a great album not for perfect, polished production or impeccable vocals. Instead, it is a wonderful example of the range of production capabilities and emotional expression of an emerging electronica musician who can stand out from the pack of indistinguishable Internet-based artists coming out every day if he chooses to.

Well, folks, it’s that time of the year, the time when our thoughts start to turn from the present and toward the future. Whether that’s summer, next semester or whatever comes next for all you seniors, spring is here and so is registration. It’s officially the season of change.
For study abroad students such as myself, this means we have begun to contemplate our triumphant return to USC come fall. As much as I all love having the freedom to explore new places and get some life experience under my belt, taking on the world can get a little exhausting. In honor of my semester abroad entering the homestretch, here are some things I miss about good ol’ USC.
Free events
Trojan hearts were breaking all over the world when Springfest photos slowly began to fill our newsfeeds. Everyone looks forward to it as one of the best days of the spring semester, and sadly, the only way to see a concert here is the old-fashioned way: pay. And Springfest isn’t the only thing that we missed out on. Every semester, Bovard Auditorium is host to a myriad of prominent public figures, celebrities, authors, politicians, etc. There’s no denying USC has the hookup when it comes to putting on events that people actually want to attend, and not having access to them anymore is a serious reminder that those Trojan family connections are not something to be taken for granted.
Access to quality Mexican food
Armandos, Chanos (now El Huero), Chipotle, Freebirds, La Taquiza, , , essentially any random taco truck. They’re all about a thousand times better than any Mexican food you will find in Europe (well, maybe not Chanos). It’s common knowledge that Los Angeles’ proximity to our southern neighbor makes for some serious culinary influence, but I never expected how much I would miss a proper burrito when I went abroad. Don’t get me wrong, there are restaurants here claiming to sell Mexican food, and their dishes seem to have all the makings of Mexican food. But it just tastes … different.
A variety of social circles
Many people who go abroad manage to make a lot of new foreign friends and become extensively involved in their university. Realistically, however, there’s no way you build up a social circle comparable to the one you spent roughly three years creating at USC. Back home, you can hang out with your roommates, your friends from class, your friends from work and your friends from different clubs and organizations all in one day. Once you go abroad, however, not only are you leaving all of your friends behind, but you also just don’t know many people in general. Not to say that people you meet abroad aren’t great, but as they say, variety is the spice of life.
The weather
This one obviously depends on where you might be studying abroad, but anyone in Northern Europe has no doubt been dreaming about those clear, sunny days lounging on McCarthy Quad or chilling in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, only to wake up in a gloomy, grey nightmare. I knew it was getting bad when I started to classify any day with sun as a nice day. I was casually perusing my weather app the other day only to find that the temperature in Los Angeles was 90 degrees. Quit showing off, Los Angeles. Also, temperatures outside the United States are measured in Celsius. What’s that about?
Trojan pride
I hate to get all cheesy on you guys, but there really is no school out there with as much pride as USC. Walking by Tommy Trojan every day, seeing people wearing USC apparel, hearing the band practicing on the field, cheering on our sports teams and so much more — our school spirit is palpable on campus, and it’s what drew so many of us to choose USC in the first place. It’s also something that I have yet to come across abroad. Maybe it’s because I attend a university with essentially no campus and — I’m serious — a carrot for a mascot, but most people I’ve met don’t feel that same dedication to their school that Trojans do. Though it won’t be easy to leave behind the perpetual adventure that is studying abroad, I think most of us await the day when we can thrust our victory fingers in the air once again and get back to fighting on with our Trojan family.

It’s that time of year — the weather is beautiful and the anticipation of summer is starting to hang in the air. For Angelenos, this time of year is the time to recover from “winter” and head out to the many hiking trails that the city has to offer.
Yes indeed, there are numerous great trails around the L.A. area, aside from the well-known Hollywood sign hike. Here are just a few, from the least daunting paths to challenging treks for the more ambitious hiker.
The Bronson Canyon trail, accessible from Hollywood, is a pleasant jaunt around a small portion of Griffith Park. Only about a mile in distance round-trip, the trail gives hikers a taste of Griffith Park without forcing them to commit to an overly challenging hiking experience. The trek is tame in its incline as well, and while hikers will find themselves in a slight climb at the beginning of their hike, the trail soon levels out and becomes very manageable.
The biggest draw to this trail is Bronson Cave, which is actually a tunnel about 50 feet in length that remains from a quarry founded in 1903. Upon seeing it, hikers may recall the cave from its appearance in many television shows and movies, such as Invasion of the Body Snatchers and some of the Star Trek films. Most significantly, this mouth of the cave can be recognized as the “Batcave” that appeared on the 1960s Batman television series. To access the trail, take Franklin Avenue to Canyon Drive, and drive until the road ends at the Camp Hollywoodland sign.
Next, the Lake Hollywood Reservoir walking trail takes hikers, bikers and joggers on a scenic trip around the Hollywood Reservoir, also known as Lake Hollywood. Located just west of Griffith Park and below Mount Lee, the peak that features the famous Hollywood sign, the trail circles the reservoir for about three and a half miles and also features the famous Hollywood sign. The distance should not sound daunting, however, because the entirety of the trail is actually a paved road around Lake Hollywood that remains almost completely level throughout.
The paved trail gives hikers beautiful views of Lake Hollywood, though the views are mostly seen through a chain-link fence that separates the trail from the water. Despite this, as hikers cross over the Mulholland Dam, they will be treated to unobstructed views of the beautiful blue water, the surrounding hills and the Hollywood sign in the distance. William Mulholland built the dam in 1925, and hikers can appreciate the architectural feat as they linger to take in the scenic view. Access to the Hollywood Reservoir walking trail can be easily found by following Lake Hollywood Drive through the neighborhood and into the hills.
Leaving Hollywood and heading over to Culver City, hikers can tackle the Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook. The main trail, accessed right off a main road, quickly climbs a one-mile incline by zigzagging up the hill. The incline is fairly steep, however, and hikers would be advised to take their time. Those who attempt this trail will want to slowly make their way up the trail anyway in order to take in the breathtaking views of the city. Cutting straight through the trail is a very steep set of stairs, which the more intense hikers or joggers may want to tackle for a great workout.
Once hikers reach the summit of the hill, they will find themselves at a stunning scenic overlook. On a clear day, the entire city of Los Angeles is visible, from the coast to downtown and beyond. In the foreground, hikers will notice film studios such as Sony Pictures studio, which is noticeable from the viewpoint because of the giant trademark rainbow structure erected in the middle of the studio grounds.
The trek is incredibly rewarding for hikers who want to tackle a more intense incline and who appreciate panoramic views of Los Angeles. It is accessible right off of Jefferson Boulevard in Culver City.
The Betty B. Dearing Trail will bring hikers to Wilacre Park, located in Studio City. Access to the trail begins at the parking lot off of Fryman Road that has restrooms and a water fountain, a plus for hikers who may have come unprepared. The trek, which spans about two and a half miles in length, is not for the faint of heart. The trail immediately starts at a very steep incline that will not level out for at least a quarter of a mile.
After the intense incline, the trail slowly begins to level out and hikers will be relieved with lovely, panoramic views of the San Fernando Valley. Hikers are then brought to Coldwater Canyon Park, home of TreePeople environmental nonprofit organization and trailheads for more treks within the park.
As a bonus for reality TV fans, upon exiting the trail in the neighborhood and walking back to the parking lot, hikers can spot the house that appears as the Kardashian-Jenner abode in Keeping Up With the Kardashians. Difficult but rewarding, the Betty B. Dearing Trail is great for a weekend workout for more seasoned hikers and fitness seekers. The parking lot and trailhead can be found off of Laurel Canyon Boulevard after driving a mile south to Fryman Road.
Clearly, there is so much more to explore on the trails of Los Angeles than the overdone, though still lovely, Hollywood sign hike. These lesser-known treks will not disappoint and will definitely offer new perspectives on the city. So, instead of Instagramming yet another view from the Hollywood sign, why not take the trail less traveled?

The scrappy indie-rock, post-punk quartet Bear Hands is steadily accumulating praise and attention for its frenetic yet poppy single “Giants,” a tune that stands out on the band’s February release, Distraction, a sophomore effort four years in the making.
The four Brooklyn, N.Y. natives and self-proclaimed “white dudes” will join an elite rank of bands and musicians at this year’s Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, Calif. The band will be playing at 12:50 p.m. on the Mojave Stage on Saturday.
Ted Feldman, the band’s guitarist, spoke to the Daily Trojan about Bear Hands’ first Coachella performance this weekend and what audiences can expect.
 
DT: Where did the name Bear Hands come from?
TF: Oh gosh, I don’t know. Val, our bass player, threw it out off the top of his head one time when we really needed to come up with a name, and it was the first thing nobody immediately batted down, so it just stuck.
 
DT: You just released your second album, Distraction, this past February after four years. How was that hiatus, and how did it influence this new record?
TF: The songs were written over the course of the four years. We did a lot of touring in that time. We just went through four years of life. Relationships changed, and as we grew as people, our music changed. I’m sure the influence was a lot, musically and lyrically. A lot of the songs are about certain events and people that we encountered during that period. But life basically influences art in general, so that was very important for the record. But we didn’t sit there and see the record being done at that time. There were a bunch of songs written over that period.
 
DT: For people who haven’t heard you, how would you describe your music?
TF: I usually say we’re four white dudes in a rock band. You should listen to it anyway.
 
DT: I guess that’s worked, because a lot of outlets have labled the band as “on the rise.” Does that put more pressure on you guys to live up to that title?
TF: I don’t feel a lot of pressure. It’s really flattering to be singled out, but we’ve been playing shows for a long time, so we’re just going to do our thing and hopefully people like it and support it.
 
DT: You’ve played a lot of festivals before, such as South by Southwest. How does playing a festival differ from other concerts and venues?
TF: A lot of the time, festivals are played during the day, and that’s a different story because for starters, people aren’t drunk yet. Maybe they are, but I feel like you can tell. People might be checking it out rather than buying a ticket specifically for your show so you are playing for a broader audience. It feels different, and also you get to watch a lot of bands. There’s a lot playing at this festival.
 
DT: Who do you want to see perform at Coachella?
TF: I will be really upset if I miss Outkast. It’s a crazy lineup. We were talking about The Replacements, but I think we’re going to miss them. The Pixies, who were just added, Chance the Rapper. I’ve been wanting to see him perform. Anything I can get to.
 
DT: With a good lineup, there are a lot of time conflicts. What would you say to convince people to come check you out during your time slot?
TF: We’re giving away free marijuana, and there’s going to be a clinic truck parked so you can get tested for STDs. A lot of good stuff.
 
DT: What’s the craziest thing that’s happened to you at a festival?
TF: I almost got arrested when we played this festival in Florida, but it wasn’t my fault. That was scary. I was literally in handcuffs, and then my bandmates convinced the cops to let me go.
 
DT: This is your first time playing at Coachella. What are you expecting and what do you hope the experience will be like?
TF: The quality of music is high. I’m expecting to see good shows. I hear it’s very clean out there so I’m interested to see what that means. I hope that things go really well the first weekend so that more people come to our show the second weekend. That would make me really happy.
 
DT: That’s a good way to look at it. You have a week in between your performances. How will your first performance differ from your second?
TF: I think the second weekend we’re going to perform as holograms. So there are going to be hologram versions of us, so that will be pretty cool. That’s a pretty big surprise so you probably shouldn’t tell people. It’s all going to be computer-generated. That’s pretty in right now.
 
DT: In all seriousness, is there anything special you and the band want to do?
TF: We haven’t really talked about it, but I think it all depends on the first festival. We’ll play it by ear because we’ve never done it. So we’ll feel out the vibes, lick our finger and put it in the air and make some decisions. The first week will probably go horribly wrong and then we’ll change the set.
 
DT: Festivals have a different energy. Is this a situation where you go in knowing you’re going to have a good time?
TF: We try not to take things too seriously, but yeah, I think we plan on having fun, partying, wilding out. It’s three days, twice, and there’s a lot to do and see at night. I hear California plays to having fun. We’re definitely hoping we have the time to hang out and do the whole experience both times.
 
DT: You guys have had transportation problems with your van. How was your trip up?
TF: The van thing is … I don’t want to even say it to jinx it, but she’s running pretty well, and we had horrible problems at SXSW. Everything is good now. The traffic is going to be back, though, but I don’t believe it. Everything is going to be smooth, we’re going to show up on time, nothing is going to go wrong.
 
DT: Do you have any pre-show or after-show rituals?
TF: Pre-show, we drink a lot and then after-show, we yell at each other.
We just put out a new record called Distraction, it came out in February and we’re playing a lot of songs from that that we haven’t played for all that many people so it’s going to be a very, very, very special occasion.
 
Bear Hands will be performing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on Saturday, April 12 and Saturday, April 19.

The top-ranked Women of Troy will look to extend their program-record 13-match winning streak this weekend at the USA Volleyball Beach Collegiate Challenge in Hermosa Beach, Calif.
Setting the tone · Senior Kirby Burnham has won 21 of her 24 matches so far this season. Burnham is riding a 13-match individual winning streak. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
 
USC (14-1) will kick off the tournament with three matches, first taking on Santa Clara (5-4) before facing off against rival and No. 6-ranked UCLA (6-6) in its second match. The team will then battle Loyola Marymount (5-7) later in the afternoon.
USC has swept Loyola Marymount twice this year, and took down the Bruins at home in similar fashion earlier this month. It will be the first time that the Women of Troy take on Santa Clara, whose program is in its second year.
Following those three matches, USC will be seeded into one of three different brackets (gold, silver or bronze) for the pairs championship to take place on Sunday.
The Women of Troy have been very successful as of late, having not dropped a match since March 8 against former No. 1-ranked Pepperdine. The Waves handed USC its only loss of the season. USC’s win against Pepperdine was only the Waves’ second loss in program history.
The Women of Troy have consistently won in dominant fashion, completing a clean 5-0 sweep in a total of 10 duels, including the last six matches in a row.
Senior Kirby Burnham, who finished as a runner-up in this tournament with graduate Stevi Robinson last year, has teamed up with freshman Sarah Hughes this season. The duo seeks to continue its success as the team’s No. 1 pair on the sand after becoming the first tandem to hit the 20-win mark this season. They currently hold an impressive 21-3 record and have brought home 13 consecutive wins.
Many say that success is contagious, and it seems to have also spread to USC’s No. 2 pair in freshman Kelly Claes and sophomore Alexa Strange, who have also reeled in five straight victories. They have gone an impressive 17-4 as a pair this season.
Unfortunately for the Women of Troy, they will be away from the familiar sands of Merle Norman Stadium, where they boast an undefeated 8-0 record this season.
In last year’s USAV Beach Collegiate Challenge, the Women of Troy captured third place after defeating Cal State Bakersfield and LMU and falling to Long Beach State.
This weekend’s tournament will be very important for the Women of Troy as the team prepares to host the first-ever Pac-12 Invitational at the Annenberg Community Beach House in Santa Monica, Calif. the following weekend, April 19-20.
Arizona, Arizona State, Bakersfield, Cal Poly and Loyola Marymount are among those that will participate in the six-team tournament.
This weekend, USC will hit the sand on Saturday at 10 a.m., and the pairs tournament commences on Sunday morning at 9 a.m.

Last week, the Star-Ledger laid off 167 of its employees, including 25 percent of its newsroom staff. Company officials say the newspaper is on track to bleed $19 million this year, losses that publisher Richard Vezza said can’t continue if the largest circulated paper in New Jersey is to survive.
Don’t expect Rutgers athletic director Julie Hermann to tear up.
On Monday, the Star-Ledger reported that Hermann remarked to a Rutgers media ethics and law class in February that it would be “great” if the newspaper ran out of business, insinuating that the paper manufactures stories to get attention.
“If they’re not writing headlines that are getting our attention, they’re not selling ads — and they die,” said Hermann, who was being recorded in the class. “And the Ledger almost died in June, right?”
A student responded: “They might die again next month.”
“That would be great,” Hermann said. “I’m going to do all I can to not give them a headline to keep them alive.”
Of course, Hermann has created plenty of headlines before.
Hermann was hired by Rutgers last May, and within weeks, shocking reports from the Star-Ledger began to surface about her tenure as Tennessee’s women’s volleyball coach in the 1990s. She reportedly quit in 1996 after all 15 members of Tennessee’s women’s volleyball team co-signed a letter saying that Hermann repeatedly called them “whores, alcoholics and learning disabled.” The players wrote, “The mental cruelty that we as a team have suffered is unbearable … It has been unanimously decided that this is an irreconcilable issue.”
Hermann didn’t just treat her players with disrespect, however. In 1997, one of Hermann’s former assistant coaches won a $150,000 lawsuit filed against the university after she claimed Hermann fired her because of her pregnancy.
So basically, Hermann doesn’t want the paper to stay alive because she would still have to be scrutinized.
I’m not so sure the Star-Ledger folding would be the end of Hermann’s problems. Consider the audience she confided in her feelings about the Star-Ledger: a class full of future media members. Did she really think those were the right people to bash a newspaper to?
Rutgers released a statement Monday defending Hermann, who has not apologized. The university pointed out her remarks were said before she knew about the recent layoffs. But is Hermann really too dim to realize that a newspaper going out of business results in all of its employees losing their jobs?
But it seems as though the school wants Hermann to extend an olive branch to the Star-Ledger.
On Thursday, Hermann hired the Star-Ledger’s longtime college sports (aka Rutgers beat) writer as Rutgers’ new senior director of digital media — effectively preventing one of the eventual layoffs she had belittled. A kind gesture, sure.
But what of the 167 staffers who were already laid off last week? The Star-Ledger is no National Enquirer, as Hermann wants us to think. The paper has won three Pulitzer Prizes over the past decade, and has earned the General Excellence Award from the New Jersey Press Association for four years running.
Maybe I’m indignant about this because Hermann is mocking the decline of the career field I’m entering next month after graduation. But in my view, this is an affront to the entire class of students that are about to cross the stage in May.
Hermann is paid to look out for the best interests of Rutgers’ student-athletes. And as those boring NCAA PSAs have told us, 99 percent of college athletes go professional in something other than sports. So I wonder how most of Rutgers’ senior student-athletes are feeling right now, a month away from facing the scary prospect of entering the real world, having just heard their athletic director trivialize the loss of hundreds of jobs.
I’m one of the lucky soon-to-be Bachelor of Arts in print and digital journalism who already has paid work lined up after graduation. But it’s only until the end of September, maybe a couple more weeks, depending on how well the San Diego Padres play this year.
After that, I’m not lucky enough to know what I’ll be doing for a living. Hermann is. As Rutgers migrates to the Big Ten, Hermann will be the face of the athletics program, reportedly earning $450,000 per year.
“I try to be compassionate with the media,” Hermann told the class. “[But it] is getting just more and more challenging.”
If Hermann keeps on going down the hole she’s dug herself — and if Rutgers doesn’t adjust well to the Big Ten — it’ll be even more challenging for her to hold onto her job.

The USC baseball team looks to pick up a much-needed series win this weekend against the University of Utah after a heartbreaking loss to No. 24 Pepperdine this past Tuesday. The Trojans, who have struggled to finish strongly in recent games, found themselves unable to hold on to their lead and fell 4-3 in the bottom of the ninth inning.
Diaper dandy · Freshman DH Jeremy Martinez has been an offensive force for the Trojans so far. Martinez is hitting .304 with 18 RBI in 28 starts. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
The Trojans started hot offensively against Pepperdine, and gained an early 2-0 lead in the top of the fourth inning. The first run was an RBI double off the bat of sophomore center fielder Timmy Robinson, allowing for freshman Jeremy Martinez to easily reach home from third base. The second run was scored later that inning thanks to the sacrifice fly delivered by sophomore Blake Lacey, which allowed Robinson to bring in the second run.
USC starter sophomore Brent Wheatley pitched impressively during his five innings of work in which he only gave up five hits. The Waves eventually managed to answer Wheatley’s tough pitching in the fifth inning and tied the score at 2-2. The game’s loss officially belonged to sophomore reliever Kyle Davis, who gave up two runs in the bottom of the ninth, allowing the Waves to secure the win.
Despite the result, the Trojans’ performed excellently considering the caliber of Pepperdine’s team, specifically their pitching staff. Pepperdine holds a 25-7 record as well as a 2.24 team ERA so far this season.
Trying to shake off this difficult loss, the Trojans will take on the Utah Utes this weekend at Dedeaux Field. Now halfway through the season, the Trojans hold a 15-16 overall record, a 4-8 conference record and a 10-8 record at home.
Utah (10-19, 1-11) has struggled mightily this season, and currently sits dead last in the Pac-12 standings. Still, like any team conference, the Utes are dangerous. Last weekend the team fell just three runs short of their series win of the season against Arizona.
On the offensive end, the Utes are led by infielder TJ Bennett, who adds 16 RBIs to his team-leading .261 batting average. Utah’s team batting average of .221 ranks among the lowest in the conference. On the mound the team is led by reliever Zach Adams, who has put together a strong 1.89 ERA over 11 appearances. The Utes’ top starter is Mitch Watrous, who leads the team with 43 strikeouts in 50 innings pitched. USC’s improving offense should match up well with Utah’s struggling staff, which has accumulated a 4.41 team ERA thus far.
Senior infielder Kevin Swick feels that a week of practice has helped his team’s offense get back on track.
“We’re starting to see a lot more pitches,” Swick said. “We’re taking longer at bats, fouling pitches off, spoiling pitches and eventually getting the result we want. So we’re definitely taking a lot better at bats.”
Though these two teams have yet to meet this season, the Trojans were victorious during their weekend series last April in Salt Lake City. The Trojans went 2-1 for the series after three unusually high scoring games, including two final scores in double digits.
Swick feels that to win the series against Utah, his team needs to come out with the same gameplan it did in last weekend’s road trip to Arizona State.
“It really comes down to what we did against Arizona State [last weekend], that’s hitting the ball low and hard,” he said. “If we can do that, I think the result will take care of itself. As far as pitching is concerned, we just need to get good starts and play good defense … If we can do that we’ll be fine.“
The Trojans will take on the University of Utah tonight at 6:00 p.m. at Dedeaux Field. Saturday’s game will also start at 6:00 p.m.

The USC defense seemed to get the better of the offense in the Trojans’ 11th practice of the spring. Both sides of the ball have adjusted well to head coach Steve Sarkisian’s quickened pace, and on Thursday the defensive line in particular put its progress on display, causing several negative plays for the offense.
Fitting in · Resdhirt junior defensive lineman Claude Pelon has shown rapid improvement over the course of spring practice. The transfer from La Mesa Community College in Mesa, Ariz. will fight for a starting spot in 2014. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“I was really encouraged by the defensive line,” Sarkisian said. “I was proud of Kenny Bigelow and Claude Pelon, two guys who, in the first couple days of spring ball, could barely stand up. Today, they’re making plays in the backfield in the fourth quarter of practice. That’s telling me a lot.”
Practicing an up-tempo offense serves a dual purpose — it gets USC’s offense ready for the type of scheme it will play when the season rolls around, and it also prepares the defense to play against fast-paced opponents, which, in the Pac-12, includes teams like Arizona, and UCLA, among others.
“We’re gonna face so many of these up-tempo teams that part of their goal is to wear you down and make their plays in the second half. Today was really meant to work the guys, and I thought they responded very well.”
BACK IN GEAR
Senior outside linebacker J.R. Tavai returned to practice today after missing the past few weeks. His impact was felt immediately, as he made multiple tackles for loss, including one on freshman quarterback Jalen Greene. Tavai tossed Greene to the turf as he tried to change direction.
“We’re a defense with an attitude,” Tavai said. “That’s what it’s supposed to look like. He [Greene] tried to spin on me, and I wasn’t gonna have it. But it’s gonna make him better.”
Tavai got limited reps at the beginning of last season but came on strong in the second half. He finished the year with 52 tackles, including eight tackles for loss, good for third on the team. He also had 3.5 sacks last season, second-most among returning players.
A hybrid outside linebacker who has played defensive end in the past, Tavai appears poised to play a big role on the defense as an edge rusher.
NEW ROLE
Among all the position groups, none appear to be as deep and talented as the Trojans’ linebacker corps. Redshirt senior Hayes Pullard is the leader of the pack, and other returners, such as redshirt junior Anthony Sarao and senior Lamar Dawson, give USC plenty of experience.
But several newcomers have shined this spring. Redshirt sophomores Scott Starr and Jabari Ruffin are talented outside rushers, as is freshman Quinton Powell. Another inexperienced player, sophomore Michael Hutchings, plays in the middle of the field, and is ready for game reps after sitting out last season.
“I’m a lot more comfortable in all aspects,” Hutchings said. “After being out here for a whole season, you feel a lot more comfortable.”
Throughout spring, Hutchings has alternated between the first and second units. Regardless of whether or not he starts, he should play many meaningful snaps once the season begins.
The transition into a larger role won’t be easy, but Hutchings has plenty of ability, and has leaned on veterans like Pullard to help him adapt.
I’m taking in everything I can from him as far as on- and off-the-field knowledge,” Hutchings said. “How to carry yourself, how to act on the field and just anything I can get from him. He’s been here for five years, and he’s got a lot of experience under his belt, so I’m just trying to soak as much in as I can.”
QUICK HITS
Sarkisian said that he intends to let incoming freshmen Adoree’ Jackson, John “JuJu” Smith and Rahshead Johnson take snaps on both sides of the ball once they arrive on campus in the summer.
Defensive Coordinator Justin Wilcox compared sophomore safety Su’a Cravens to Washington linebacker Shaq Thompson. Thompson, who switched from safety to linebacker, is one of the most dominant defensive players in the conference.
“They’re both big, athletic guys who love football and have really good instincts,” Wilcox said. “Su’a can play safety, he can play a big nickel position for us. He’s a very good blitzer and a very good tackler.”
USC will practice next on Saturday at 11 a.m. at Howard Jones Field.

On Wednesday, 16-year-old Alex Hribal rampaged through the hallways of Franklin Regional Senior High School in Murrysville, Pa. with two kitchen knives in hand and stabbed 21 of his fellow classmates and a security officer before being tackled to the ground by assistant principal Samuel King, according to Reuters. Though some have made the argument that this case negates the argument for gun control as there are clearly other lethal weapons, this conclusion fails to acknowledge that guns ultimately result in more casualties and that all cases of school violence highlight the need for increased security preparedness in schools.
Design by Julien Nicolai
Charged with four counts of attempted homicide, 21 counts of aggravated assault and one count of bringing a weapon to school property, Hribal is currently being held without bail at the Westmoreland County Juvenile Detention Center in Greensburg, Pa., according to CNN. Meanwhile, several of his fellow students are currently hospitalized, with one in critical condition and three others having undergone emergency surgery.
One of Hribal’s victims, Brett Hurt, suffered from a bruised lung as a result of a stab wound to the back. According to CNN, he is expected to be released this week.
What happened to Hurt and his other classmates was an unthinkable act of violence that no one should be exposed to. But, unlike the victims of similar acts of violence in which a gun was used, Hurt and his classmates survived.
Mitchell College Associate Professor Herb Nieburg told ABC News that knife attacks are indicative of mental illness and that such attacks, though meant to inflict pain, are ultimately not as effective as guns are in causing harm. Unlike the deliberate actions involved with aiming and shooting a firearm, the impulsivity of stabbing is more erratic.
“This is what we call a disorganized homicide attempt,” Nieburg said. “Someone who uses a knife is extremely angry and very out of control. It indicates they really wanted to inflict pain — it’s not as quick as a gun.”
Though the majority of Hribal’s victims were treated and are expected to be fine, not all of the students were as lucky. Of the 21 total victims, four of them were in critical condition as of Wednesday, one of whom was “eviscerated” and might not survive, according to CNN. To completely rule out the validity of the need for gun control based on the multitude of lethal weapons, however, fails to address the danger that weapons like guns still pose on school campuses. Had Hribal brought a gun to campus, it is likely that he would have been able to harm more students at a higher level of severity than he was able to with knives alone. Furthermore, it’s unlikely that someone would have been able to tackle him to the ground had he been armed with a firearm.
“Obviously one gun is one too many and one knife is one too many,” National School Safety and Security Services President Ken Trump told U.S. News. “But it’s just one additional threat that schools need to be prepared to manage.”
No one can argue with the fact that knives, like other weapons, can be lethal when in the wrong hands. The severity of what happened at Franklin Regional Senior High School should be treated with the same seriousness and urgency as the multitude of other school attacks that have occurred. This tragedy cannot and should not be used as an argument by those against gun control simply because other tools can be dangerous as well. If anything, it should only further what the entire gun control conversation has been about — ensuring the safety of our children and educators.

Why is it that cities across America with the strongest gun-control have the highest crime (i.e. Chicago, DC, etc…)? The Supreme Court has already ruled that the police have no duty to protect you, so unarmed citizens are just called victims in those places.
Gun prohibitionists are literally panicking that there are indeed other weapons that can be, and are being misused.  And they are actually putting out the call to “stay the course” on more worthless gun control.  How about more school security with armed school resource officers.  How about not asking school teachers and staff to go up against armed assailants while they themselves are unarmed and vulnerable.
“…some have made the argument that this case negates the argument for gun control as there are clearly other lethal weapons, this conclusion fails to acknowledge that guns ultimately result in more casualties…”           Bogus.  Guns are already “controlled” as are cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, pharmaceuticals, ladders, toys, and almost everything.  How has that been working out?  Kids still smoke, drink, and take pills and sometimes the public suffers the dire consequences.  But if we’re concerned with deaths of children shouldn’t we be taking a hard look at swimming pools?  Bad behavior is the real culprit but it’s already against the law to harm another person.  Even police officers kill and injure innocent people.  Should we take away the mace, pepper spray, batons, and guns from all the police because of the actions of a few miscreants?
Of course it should not detract from gun control efforts. The fact that we have the lowest homicide rate in the last 100 years should make all talk of gun control a moot point.
“highlight the need for increased security preparedness in schools.” Exactly. I don’t care why they do it. I don’t care how they do it. Lets focus on neutralizing the threat when it presents itself. When someone poses a threat to others the focus should be on how to negate the threat as quickly as possible.
Way, way off.
It should read, “The school stabbing should not detract us from our lack of civic and civil community and our lack of proper funding and support of mental health services.”
As a fellow mental health professional, I’d like to inform the populace that I don’t think that a knife stabbing is necessarily more insane than a gun shooting.  I think that associate professor is talking out of his hind quarters.
Our children are mass-murdering each other.  The elephant in the room.
Maybe we should ask, “Why is that?”, instead of waxing all emotional and knee-jerk, only to blindly support a socialist/marxist agenda that would enslave us all?
Everything is an excuse for the gun ban people to pursue their vendetta against the law abiding citizenry.
And yet again the real weapon is ignored, the screwed up human, in favor of continuing to blame an inanimate object made of metal, plastic, and wood.  The proposed logic says that if we remove tools, all evil will cease to exist.  How very foolish.  Evil existed in the hearts of man before guns and before swords.  Treating the evil appropriately is the only answer.
Knife violence should never detract from attacks on the Second Amendment, it just wouldn’t be right.
DailyTrojan or Daily Troll… I guess both with these garbage articles.
The author admits a “tackle” would probably have been impossible had the attacker been armed with a gun. Yet still suggests armed teachers are “ultimately going to result in more casualties”. At the same time calling for “more security preparedness”. ???
The proper response, when someone is shooting at you is to shoot back. You will need a gun for this. It is also the only way to protect an innocent, If you care as much about people as you think you do. If you do not have a gun, call police. Why? Because they have a gun. / Reread paragraph until it sinks in.
Yasmeen is a writer but that doesn’t make her an expert.  And maybe she doesn’t know that guns are already highly regulated (infringed).
Sigmund Freud said, “A Fear of Weapons is a Sign of Retarded Sexual and Emotional Maturity.”   He must have been studying Liberal Democrats.
Sorry, if you are trying to make the argument that knives are somehow less deadly than handguns, you are wrong. 
Both stab wounds and pistol wounds in the same areas have the same mortality rates, with an overall mortality rate of 17% for both. 
A recent attack in China proved this, with over 20 stabbing deaths and over 100 people injured at a train station. 
The only real factor that determines the number of dead and injured is still the duration of the attack. That faster the attack is stopped, the lower the number of casualties. 
This is why the best way to secure schools, churches and other targets is to get rid of their ‘gun free zone’ image and have armed security present. 
Compare this attack with the recent on in CO. That attack was stopped within 90 second by an on-site sheriff’s deputy and only resulted in a single death, even though the attacker was far more heavily armed. 
We don’t need ‘gun control’ any more than we need ‘knife control’. 
We need to put in place effective protection for our schools, and that means having ‘good guys with guns’ there whenever the kids are present.
Can you source the mortality rate statistic of guns/knifes, please?
Thank you.
Look it up.
I wanted to know your sources. I am aware google exists, but I can’t read your mind.
Correct.  Additionally, as one witness observed, the school hallways are frequently loud and filled with children screaming.  The sound of gunfire would send them all running but screaming didn’t.
The gun control conversation has never been about the safety of our children.  None of the anti-gun laws passed in Connecticut after Sandy Hook would have prevented Sandy Hook.  Those laws, and every law that has been proposed over the past year have been about nothing other than infringing on the rights of law abiding gun owners in order to make the public feel like something was being done.  The conversation in the media after the recent knife attack was much more grounded in mental health issues, as all of these attacks should have been.  This most recent school tragedy is an opportunity to move away from focusing on the weapon and focusing on the true root cause of the problem.
“School stabbing should not detract from gun control efforts”
Yes, we mustn’t let facts get in the way of our Agenda!

No gunshots pierced the air, but the gory scene on Wednesday at Franklin Regional Senior High School in Murrysville, Pa. catapulted the already contentious subject of gun reform back into debate. Twenty-one students and a security official were wounded by 16-year-old Alex Hribal, who went on a stabbing spree with two kitchen knives until he was finally tackled by the assistant principal, according to Reuters. Though this violent episode might spark talk of arming school officials or the banning of knives, the focus should be on preparing school officials for any weapon because, in the hands of a unstable killer, anything is lethal.
Design by Julien Nicolai
 
Though gun control does minimize the range of weapons that potential killers can get a hold of, there are so many other things that could do just as much damage — knives especially. Yes, bullets kill with more accuracy, precision and speed, but knives can be just as lethal. Though there were no fatalities in the Murrysville case, the Los Angeles Times reported that at least four students were critically wounded. Dr. Louis Alarcon of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center told Reuters he operated on a 17-year-old who had knife wounds through his liver, diaphragm and major blood vessels.
Recent news in China regarding stabbing rampages also attest to the logic of comparing knives to guns, though only one of these is expressly designed to end life. On the same day Adam Lanza opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed 26 individuals in December 2012, a 36-year-old man in the Chinese village of Chenpeng stabbed 22 elementary school children and an elderly woman, according to U.S. News. On March 1 in Kunming, China, a group wielding large knives killed 29 people and injured 130. More than 70 remained hospitalized — and this is from a country that has stricter gun control policies than the United States.
Limiting the availability of guns will prevent deaths and incidents to a small degree, but when there is a will to kill, people will go to any length and use any weapon to follow through on their objective.
It’s not the weapon that should be the focus, but rather the preparedness of school officials to protect students and staff from any instance of violence. School security was ramped up against guns nationwide in the wake of Sandy Hook, but no one expected a stabbing rampage. The unexpected is always dangerous, and it seems reasonable not to target what weapons to look out for, but to concentrate more on the strategies to prepare for them.
The motivation behind the stabbing and shooting rampages in recent years has been mental instability. There are so many factors at play here — parenting, violence in the media, depression, bullying — and there isn’t a universal method to combat this.
Instead of touting an impractical solution in picking out mentally unstable cases, the first and best line of defense is to be practical and to react well even if it’s difficult to pinpoint and prevent situations rooted in mental instability.
This doesn’t mean arming teachers with guns, but rather having a school that can react quickly and prevent deaths. As the president of the National School Safety and Security Services, Ken Trump told U.S. News, “The first and best line of defense is always a well-trained, highly-alert staff and student body.” According to Reuters, student Nate Scimio pulled the fire alarm to alert students and helped shield his classmates. In situations like these, more students like Scimio would definitely help combat stabbing — even shooting — rampages in the future. To truly address the heart of the problem, practical strategies are needed.
