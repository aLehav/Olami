Female students of color shared their personal experiences with the intersection of race and sexuality, sharing personal anecdotes and feelings.
The Women Speak on Sex and Race, hosted by the Women’s Student Assembly Thursday night at Ground Zero, was the second event of Sex Week.
Elizabeth Soriano, a junior majoring in communication, talked about racism she experienced on campus. Soriano spoke about how her roommate made a negative comment about her for being of Mexican descent.

“That was one of my anxieties from my first semester here,” Soriano said. “Because aside from that, I had a lot of internalized racism. Coming from a close-knit community, I felt more alone here, and truthfully, my first semester here was one of the most terrifying experiences.”
WSA Co-Director Taylor Markey said she wanted this event to be a space for all those who had things to say and stories to share, but never previously could.
“Often women of color are marginalized, and we wanted to give women of color a space to talk about their specific lived experiences with sexuality so that we can have a more intersectional week,” Markey said.
Rikiesha Pierce, a senior majoring in sociology and the first in her family to go to college, said the transition to college was made more difficult because she felt that few people understood her background. The value of the discourse, she said, would be instrumental in helping others learn and, in some cases, cope.
“It’s important that we speak, because too often we’ve been left to deal with our silence,” Pierce said. “It’s definitely very inspiring and eye opening, [about] a lot of things that a good population here doesn’t know about in terms of sexuality and race.”
Savannah LeJeune-Stodieck, a junior majoring in film and television production, believed the event could be a meaningful experience for the entire student body.
Markey said Sex Week responds to narratives regarding on our race and sexuality.
“This week is about women and men being able to talk back to the sexual culture at USC,” Markey said. “[It’s about the] fight against this narrative that we have to accept this culture that already exists and react to it passively. [We want to] instead give people an opportunity and a space to say something that can maybe start a new culture that is formed by the people who are a part of it.”
Sarah Tillery, a junior majoring in English (Creative Writing) , was inspired by the candid and heartfelt nature of the talk.
“I think it’s absolutely wonderful that people would share their feelings, deepest thoughts and insecurities with strangers,” Tillery said. “Events like these are very helpful and empowering for everyone.”
The events for this year’s Sex Week was inspired by a post on the USC Compliments group on Facebook. This year focuses on celebrating four days of healthy hookups, femininity and sex positivity, Markey said. The event emphasized the importance of finding ways to sexually express oneself and being a part of creating a sexual culture rather than simply reacting to it.

The USC women’s golf team notched another victory on Tuesday, overcoming an eight-stroke deficit in the final round of the Bruin Wave Invitational. Freshman Annie Park was also a winner, finishing 1-under for the tournament and claiming her first collegiate individual title.
The win is the squad’s second in a row after last week’s Sugar Bowl Invitational in New Orleans, and its third of the season. USC head coach Andrea Gaston was thrilled with the team’s effort.
“It’s exciting to come back and win the tournament,” Gaston said. “Especially against the Bruins.”
As usual, the road to victory was not easy. Archrival and host UCLA had marched ahead of the No. 1 Trojans during the second of Monday’s two rounds, capitalizing on a poor 13-over 301 performance from their top-ranked crosstown foe. Fortunately, the Trojans had jumped to an early lead in the first of the day’s rounds, helped by the excellent efforts of eventual individual tournament champion Park. Her 4-under 68 on the first 18 kept the possibility of a comeback win in the cards. The freshman posted an even-par effort over the first 36 holes, making her one of only two players at the El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana, Calif., to manage such a feat.
“El Caballero is an extremely challenging course, and required a lot of patience,” Gaston said. “Sometimes a bogey is a good score.”
It was on day two that Park and her team made their move, getting consistent, steady efforts from multiple golfers during the final round. Park’s 1-under set the tone, while freshman Kyung Kim, junior Sophia Popov and sophomore Doris Chen turned in solid scores just above par.
Kim finished her 72 holes in seventh place at 7-over, while Popov and Chen tied for 10th just one stroke behind. Park’s collective 1-under gave her a four-stroke win over Pepperdine’s Marissa Chow, while day one leader Lee Lopez of UCLA faded in the final round with a 7-over 79.
The Trojans now receive a much needed break and will not return to action until the end of the month at the San Diego State Farms Invitational in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.
“This is another great win for our team,” Gaston said. “Now we have about three weeks to go back to work and prepare for our next tournament.”

USC has a chance to redeem its opening-day loss on Wednesday when the Trojans host a rematch against No. 13 Cal State Fullerton.
Since defeating the Trojans 3-2 to launch the season, the Titans have been “running on all cylinders,” USC head coach Dan Hubbs said. Fullerton climbed five spots in the NCAA rankings this weekend and boasts both a 10-1 record — losing for the first time Sunday — and a spotless winning percentage on the road.
The Trojans (6-5) return to Dedeaux after a losing road series against Fresno State, which started with a victorious 9-1 slugfest but culminated in a 14-3 blowout.
“If we learned something from [the loss] then it’s not bad that it happened this early in the season,” Hubbs said. “Fresno showed us how to be relentless offensively and kick a team when they’re down. We need to learn how to do that.”
The Trojans have sparked some life into bats that were silent in their first meeting with the Titans. Their team batting average has steadily climbed to .289 but, despite the progress, the Trojans have accumulated new offensive woes — namely, leaving runners on base.
In the two losses to Fresno State this weekend, the Trojans pulled together a combined 17 hits that produced only four runs, while stranding 20 runners.
“We’ve been hitting the ball well. We’ve had a lot of hard contact. We’ve been way better and tougher outs with two strikes,” Hubbs said. “It’s just a matter of getting the big hit.”
That big hit might come off a different bat this Wednesday, as Hubbs will be sending out a younger team than usual to combat a recent string of injuries.
Sophomore first baseman Dante Flores was out for the weekend with a sore wrist and underwent an MRI on Monday. If he isn’t ready to play Wednesday, Hubbs said freshman AJ Ramirez — who is hitting .379 on the season — will step in. Senior first baseman Adam Landecker is day-to-day with a pulled hamstring and will not play against the Titans, but Hubbs is hopeful he will be ready to start this weekend. For now, freshman Blake Lacey will take his spot.
Additionally, sophomore catcher Garrett Stubbs left Friday’s game after a home-plate collision and will be replaced by junior Jake Hernandez. Redshirt senior outfielder Greg Zebrack returns after a brief stint with the flu, and usual Saturday starter Wyatt Strahan is expected to re-join the rotation this weekend after taking a precautionary rest for a stiff shoulder.
Hubbs said he hasn’t been able to wrap his head around who will start in the outfield and that he will figure out who fills in as designated hitter when he finalizes his lineup. Hernandez spent the Fresno series at the designated hitter slot but will be behind the dish Wednesday. In the previous series, Ramirez was the DH, but he will likely play first base.
Hubbs also noted the team will face a “stiff challenge” in Titans starting pitcher Koby Gauna, who the team faced last year and who is pitching up to 94 mph.
Freshman right-hander Brent Wheatley, who will take the mound against the more veteran Titans team, said he doesn’t feel any added pressure going into Wednesday’s game because he trusts his teammates to get the job done.
“You can’t change your mentality,” Wheatley said. “You just have to keep doing what you’re doing out there on the mound and just pound the strike zone. That’s all I can do as a pitcher.”
Despite USC’s relative inexperience against disciplined Fullerton, Hubbs identified two areas that will be determining factors in Wednesday’s matchup and for the rest of the season.
“We have to pitch a little bit better out of the bullpen and we have to get a big hit,” Hubbs said. “If we can do those two things, we’re going to be in every game.”

Junior forward Cassie Harberts’ impressive season was recognized by the Pac-12, earning her a spot on the 2013 All-Pac-12 team for the first time in her career. Harberts, who earned All-Pac-12 honorable mention last season and was a member of the Pac-10 All-Freshman team, led the Women of Troy with 17.9 points (45th in the nation), 8.1 rebounds and 0.9 blocks per game on the season. She accounted for 268 out of USC’s 609 free-throw attempts, making 187 of those attempts, and led the NCAA in free-throw attempts. She also finished with 10 double-doubles on the season to give her 16 for her career and scored in double-digits in every game except for one.

Harberts ranks in the top 10 in scoring, rebounds and blocks in the Pac-12 and has started every game since she was a freshman. She was the Pac-12 player of the week on Jan. 7 and became the 24th Trojan to break the 1,000-point mark on Jan. 13 against Washington State. She has 1,253 points for her career, which ranks 16th all-time at USC. She is fifth all-time in free throws made with 407.
Sophomore guard Ariya Crook also earned All-Pac-12 honorable mention, while freshman guard Brianna Barrett earned a spot on the All-Freshman and All-Defensive honorable mention teams. Crook finished the season averaging 13.4 points and three assists per game (10th in the conference) serving mostly in a reserve role and scored in double-digits in 20 games this season. She ranks eighth all-time with 54 3-pointers in a single season. Barrett led the team with 3.2 assists and 1.7 steals per game this season, starting in 19 of USC’s 29 games.

On Monday, the Los Angeles Times reported that USC Athletic Director Pat Haden reached out to former USC men’s basketball head coach Tim Floyd. The two met for over three hours to discuss the Trojans’ coaching situation beyond this season. Haden declined to comment, but Floyd said everything “went well.”
At this point, I’d like to interject. Tim Floyd? The guy who unceremoniously left town and played a part in the Trojans vacating their 21-win 2007-08 season for possible NCAA infractions? Has Haden lost his mind?
Some will throw out the cliches that come with an ongoing coaching search — Haden is covering his bases and doing his due diligence by speaking to Floyd, who has an intimate knowledge of the program and was fairly successful at USC. After all, Floyd was 85-55 with the Trojans, making three straight NCAA tournament appearances. Few have had his level of success in school history. I get that logic, to a certain extent.
But Floyd, who has maintained his innocence in the wake of the O.J. Mayo scandal that sent shockwaves through an already fragile basketball program, is about as toxic as they come for an athletic director who has tried to distance himself from any shady activity. Whether the current University of Texas at El Paso coach was simply giving his two cents or throwing his name out there as a candidate makes no difference — Haden should not be speaking with Floyd, period.
Though USC has been playing inspired basketball of late, picking up a big-time victory over then-No. 11 Arizona and going 6-2 in its last eight contests, no one can blame Haden for seeing what the coaching market looks like beyond interim option Bob Cantu. In fact, I applaud him for reaching out to longtime Syracuse assistant Mike Hopkins, who is from Southern California and is the rumored successor to Jim Boeheim.
It’s a match that makes sense for both sides — Hopkins returns home and gets his first head coaching opportunity while USC gets one of the most desired assistants in the country with the pedigree of an elite basketball program to boot — which is what makes the Floyd situation even more dumbfounding.
There are a baker’s dozen of elite assistants across the country licking their chops at the opportunity to be the head honcho at a major university. There are also plenty of other candidates, including Memphis’ Josh Pastner and Pittsburgh’s Jamie Dixon, who would have some level of interest in the position.
And there’s still Cantu, who has righted the ship for an underperforming team that is entering the Pac-12 tournament playing its best basketball of the season. The options are there. No need to muddy up the process by bringing bad press into this decision.
That’s what Floyd really is  — bad press. He’s pointed out that, technically, the NCAA never found him guilty of any violations. Most have their doubts, but even under the assumption that he’s clean, what’s the point of entertaining the thought of bringing him back? If he truly had no idea about any recruiting violations, then that in itself is an issue no USC sports team should want to deal with. Any media story involving Floyd would make its way back to Mayo.
I’m all for thinking outside the box with this pending coaching decision. I hope Haden chooses someone with recruiting power, NCAA tournament pedigree and the passion necessary to revitalize a mostly dormant team. With Floyd, however, Haden is taking things a step too far. He’s without a doubt an accomplished coach, one capable of turning around a program as he did with USC a few years ago. But when it comes down to it, there are other choices that make more sense and carry far less baggage. The last thing USC needs right now is more controversy surrounding one of its sports teams.
 
“The Fifth Down” runs Wednesdays. To comment on this story, email Alex at ajshultz@usc.edu or visit 
dailytrojan.com.
Here is a summary of what Tim Floyd did (while not winning any conference championships in 4 years):
    1. Worked through a handler, Rodney Guillory, who said he could deliver
    OJ Mayo (starting in Mayo’s junior year of high school) to USC, causing
    him to become a representative of the institution’s athletic interests
    in violation of NCAA rules. 
    2. Floyd gave his assistant men’s basketball coach the name and phone
    number of Guillory.  He then ignored the article found by the assistant
    coach that identified Guillory as a “runner” for a sports agent in a
    case involving another NCAA college. 
   3.  Floyd received similar information from USC’s compliance office
    later in 2005, and in 2006 the USC director of compliance told him about
    concerns over the recruitment of Mayo and asked that the recruitment
    end; he failed to heed the advice, and Mayo attended USC for one year.
    OJ Mayo and his associates (brother, girlfriend, and girlfriend’s
    mother) took benefits (cash, lodging, merchandise, automobile
    transportation, meals, airline transportation, and services) from
    professional sports agents (Bill Duffy Associates) and/or persons who
    acted on behalf of these agents (Guillory) starting during the
    recruitment process though his time at USC.
    4. There was nothing in the NCAA report about Floyd giving Guillory
    $1000 for Mayo, so Mayo’s “friend” Johnson apparently lied about that.
    5. The results of these violations: USC vacated its 21 wins from the
    2007-08 season, withdrew from postseason consideration for the 2009-10
    season, limited basketball scholarships to 12 for 2009-10 and 2010-11,
    reduced by one the number of men’s basketball coaches permitted to
    engage in off-campus recruiting in summer 2010, and reduced the total
    number of recruiting days in men’s basketball by 20 days for 2010-11.
    6.  USC also returned $206,020 received from the Pac-10 for 2008 men’s
    basketball tournament participation, disassociated Mayo from USC,
    released three men’s basketball prospective athletes from their letters
    of intent, and was put on probation for four years.
Where is the editor of the DT?
Anything from anyone, no matter how shoddy or self-serving gets published. WTF?
This makes USC look very mediocre and I do not like it one bit. Step forward Editor and be named–you really seem to have no interest in the integrity fo the DT. Shame on you.
I know you are practicing to be a journalist, I get that, but there needs to be an editor at the DT that stops people from putting out rediculeous articles like this one.  Your premise is USC shouldn’t hire TF because it would look bad.  Really?  Since when should leaders like Haden make decisions based on public perception (which BTW is an incorrect perception).  
Further, it’s actually USC’s fault for not going on a  PR campaign to clear up the inconsistencies with the NCAA and their witch hunt. 
Giving in to public perception WRT Floyd is not the way you lead.
What a horrid little comment. Floyd gets run out of town by an incompetent athletic director looking for a scapegoat for the football disaster and an attempt to right a wrong is met with this drivel? Floyd Dan a first class program, graduated his kids and won. Kiffen has a ton of NCAA reprimands…he’s still coach. Double standard here ?

The USC men’s basketball team might have played its last game at the Galen Center in its victory over Arizona State last Sunday, but the season isn’t over. The Trojans (14-15, 9-7 Pac-12) will travel to Washington to face the Huskies on Wednesday and the Washington State Cougars on Saturday to finish the regular season before entering the Pac-12 championship next week.

Senior guard Jio Fontan sprained his wrist in the victory over the Sun Devils last Sunday but was cleared to play Wednesday. Fontan admitted that the wrist was still sore but that he hoped to be ready for tipoff. In preparing for the Huskies, the floor general was emphatic about starting strong, as the Trojans have done in big wins over Arizona and UCLA.
“First and foremost, just get stops,” Fontan said. “Whenever we get stops and get out in transition, we’re very effective. If we can get stops early on in the game, we’ll put ourselves in a position to win later on. If we give up too many points in the first half, a lot of the baskets will have to come in the half court and [that will] slow everything down.”
The importance of pace was echoed in practice by assistant coach Dieter Horton, who at one point stopped a drill to emphasize how opting for a bounce pass instead of a standard swing pass at the wings could interrupt rhythm and slow the delicately timed pacing of the half-court set.
For veterans like senior forward Eric Wise, keeping up with the pace of the offense is just a matter of preparation. Wise, who is coming off a season-high 22 point outing in last week’s win over Arizona, will look to continue his strong play in finishing the season.
“We just have to come out ready to play and warm up hard,” Wise said. “I know for me, I just try to come into every game focused. Hopefully [last week’s success] can carry over into this weekend.”
Junior Dewayne Dedmon emphasized the importance of defensive intensity in facing the Huskies’ own brand of fast-paced offense.
“We have to come out with the same intensity that we had the first time we played them,” Dedmon said. “We have to come out with energy and make sure that we get stops on the defensive end.”
The Huskies (16-13, 8-8 Pac-12) are led by sharpshooting senior guard Scott Suggs and junior guard C.J. Wilcox. Wilcox leads Washington in scoring at 17.3 points per game, good for sixth in the Pac-12, and Suggs is shooting a respectable 38 percent from beyond the arc on the season. When asked what the Trojans must do to limit the Huskies’ tandem of wings offensively, USC interim head coach Bob Cantu started on the other side of the court.
“Transition defense — they’re very good at home, they have a great crowd and a great environment,” Cantu said. “They like to push the ball and do a good job of getting out in the open court. We have to get back and defend the three-point line against Wilcox and Suggs, [and] we have to be able to take good shots on offense that don’t lead to long rebounds and easy baskets for them. If we can control tempo and execute, then I like our chances.”
Despite a season filled with trials and difficulties, the Trojans have been surprisingly stellar in conference play, and they have an outside shot at securing a first-round bye in the Pac-12 tournament. USC owns the tiebreaker over No. 18 Arizona (23-6, 11-6 Pac-12) and is tied with Colorado (19-9, 9-7 Pac-12) who plays host to No. 19 Oregon (23-6, 12-4 Pac-12) Thursday. A loss from Colorado and Arizona would open the door to the No. 4 seed for the Trojans, who can then secure the bye with two wins to finish the season. When asked if the thought of the first round bye was on the Trojans’ mind, Fontan eschewed bravado in favor of perspective.
“At this time, I think it’s just a matter of getting better,” Fontan said. “A lot of our veteran guys like Eric Wise and Dewayne Dedmon are starting to get more comfortable in the offense, and defensively getting more accustomed to what we’re trying to do.”
The Trojans have steadily improved since Cantu took over for former head coach Kevin O’Neill, and they are starting to play up to the expectations that had prefaced their season. The Pac-12 has yet to see one outright dominant team, as the top-six teams in the Pac-12 are separated by three losses. All of this considered, the prospect of missing the first-round bye didn’t fluster floor leader Fontan in the least.
“If we have to play four games out in Vegas, we’ll take it,” Fontan said.

For the first time in four years, Matt Barkley wasn’t suiting up for the Trojans on the Howard Jones practice field. Nor was T.J. McDonald, Nickell Robey or Khaled Holmes.
Though the faces were different on the field, practice went on as usual. USC coach Lane Kiffin insisted that the lack of current leaders will be temporary.
“It’s one practice,” Kiffin said. “I don’t think you can get to that point and figure that out. It’s easy right now. It’s fun, no pads are on … This isn’t where leadership really shows up. It shows up when you get in really tough times.”
Quarterback controversy· Incoming freshman quarterback Max Browne (No. 4) enters a tightly contested quarterback battle against sophomore incumbents Max Wittek and Cody Kessler. — Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Looking to take Barkley’s spot as starting quarterback is a trio of players. Sophomore quarterback Max Wittek seems to have the leg up on sophomore Cody Kessler, having started the last two games of the season while Barkley was injured. The third member of the competing triad is freshman Max Browne, who was the Gatorade national high school player of the year in 2012.
“It was a little rough, getting used to everything,” Browne said. “Every rep is like a whole ’nother mission out there.”
Browne started his last three seasons at Skyline High School in Sammamish, Wash. His debut for USC marks the first time he’s competed for a starting job in a few years. Browne insists he’s ready for the challenge.
“My goal is to compete, go out here and showcase what I can do best,” Browne said. “If my best is good enough, we’ll see where the chips fall … There’s a reason I came here. I went to SC because I know the best players come here.”
The other major question mark is the Trojan defense, having surrendered 26 points per game last season. Former Cal defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergrast was hired to lead the unit in place of Monte Kiffin. One of the major things the defense is working on this spring is a new playbook — the Trojans are moving from a 4-3 defense to a 3-4 defense.
Junior linebacker Hayes Pullard said there have been some challenges in getting used to the new scheme.
“Just learning the different terminologies the coaches use,” Pullard said. “It’s probably all the same things, just learning new terminologies.”
Though things weren’t as crisp as they will be later in the spring, Pullard liked the way the team came out.
“The energy was fantastic,” Pullard said. “I thought the guys were going to be a little low because they were trying to figure things out. But we came out here, matched the intensity we had in ball practice last year.”
Make me proud of my Moniker. Or just Beat UCLA this year. This coming from a Syracuse Grad. SC may get an Assistant Couch (for Basketball) from SU. Go Trojans!
I wonder if they had a locker room brawl after the 1st practice.
Despite the QB controversy, we do know one thing…they are likely going to take it to the Max. When is the last time anyone had a QB named Max, let alone 2 of them.

His parents know him as Richard Andrew, his fans know him as Outasight and casual listeners know him for “that song stuck in my head.”

Just a few years ago, though, few would have known much about the New York native. The unknown singer found himself suddenly catapulted into the music spotlight after his unreleased single “Tonight is the Night” became the featured song of Pepsi’s “Who’s Next?” commercial.
Since then, he has cultivated a loyal fanbase through his unique ability to meet the modern demand for dance-all-night tunes. The singer, who has been tearing up arenas all around the United States in support of his first full-length album “Nights Like These,” promises that his concert at The Roxy Theatre on Friday will be a night to remember.
“We play loud, we play fast and we’re going to get the party going and have a good time. I’m really excited,” Andrew said.
Though Andrew might seem like an overnight success in the music world, he is anything but.
Just a few short years ago, Andrew was a college dropout working as a Brooklyn fry cook to pay for his own studio time. He also spent years driving around to open mics and performing for whomever would listen. In 2007, he released his first mixtape Employee of the Year EP, followed by the release of Radio New York in 2008.
Andrew eventually signed with Warner Brothers Records in 2009. It was at this time Andrew was ready to release “Tonight is the Night,” the song that would change his career forever.
His manager, Rene Mclean, submitted Andrew’s demo to Pepsi, which was soliciting energetic party tunes to anchor its upcoming campaign. Despite the fact that Andrew was a long shot, Pepsi evidently heard something in Andrew’s sound and selected “Tonight is the Night” for its “Who’s Next?” commercial.
The 60-second spot also included superstars such as Ray Charles, Britney Spears and Michael Jackson, but Andrew’s distinctive sound allowed him to stand out among the titans.
“That kind of catapulted the song, which was previously unreleased, to a whole new level,” Andrew said. “It just went from a very organic day-by-day process to a mad rush. It just changed things so dramatically.”
After the release of the commercial, people began to take notice of the singer as someone clearly on the rise in the music industry.
“It just started right there, hearing your own song on the radio and starting to perform all around the world,” Andrew said. “It’s just a totally different thing — it took off on a whole new level so it was really kind of my breakthrough moment.”
What sets Andrew apart is his unique ability to fuse soul, rap, pop and rock into a futuristic sound. A fan of many genres, he says he never felt the need to choose just one.
“Since I can sing a little bit and rap a little bit, I never felt I had to be necessarily one style of music. So when it comes to writing material, it’s just wherever the inspiration takes me and it kind of goes across genres,” Andrew said.
Andrew has embraced his popularity and ability to connect with his fans, while keeping his feet rooted firmly on the ground. When asked about his tour, he retained a refreshingly youthful exuberance. While discussing the opportunities he has had on the road.
“The tour has been awesome. Ours has been exceeding expectations really,” Andrew said. “I wasn’t necessarily sure what to expect — you never do. We got out on the road and every night the kids are bringing amazing energy.”
For Andrew, it’s all about taking in new experiences.
“It’s so much fun for me because I got my band with me and we’re just crushing shows and having fun,” Andrew said. “It’s just been a great tour. [I’m] looking forward to going and seeing places I haven’t seen [and] just keep building an audience.”

Slash. Hamlet. Bowie. Vertigo. Nas. Goodfellas. Tupac. Sometimes, one word is all you need to make a lasting impact. This week’s New Noise looks at new releases by bands of few words — bands who gave their four-minute melodic visions a single term of endearment.
Though the names might be short, the tracks are filled with layers of musical arrangement, with appearances made by a gospel choir, a couple bands of the nostalgic past and a hunk of reggae meat in a punk sandwich.
Yeah Yeah Yeahs: “Sacrilege”
The members of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have always had a unique quality to them that has made them stand out. Maybe it’s their divinely perfect meld of new wave and post-punk elements or their mysterious personas that add to the charisma.
“Sacrilege” is off the band’s upcoming fourth album Mosquito, which is to be released next month, and the song is in top YYY form. Produced by Dave Sitek (TV on the Radio) and the prolific Nick Launay, the song goes hardcore with the religious theme, featuring a full on 24-piece gospel choir backing up the inimitable vocals of Karen O.
Most YYY songs sound like they were made by mining up a gemstone, roughing it up with a sledgehammer and then spinning it on a record player — it might be roughed up and distorted, but it’s still beautiful.
“Sacrilege” follows in this manner. The whole song is a stretched-out crescendo, beginning with a murmur and ending with a dramatic windup. The gospel choir definitely kicks things up a notch and gives the song an almost somber tone. It’s almost like the art-punk version of the Stones’ “Gimme Shelter.”
The more you play this track, the better it gets. What’s real sacrilege is trying to find something wrong with this song.


 
Is Paris Burning: “Wild”
Keeping in the post-punk vein, Is Paris Burning is a brilliant new addition to the shoegaze indie revival of the past few years. The trio formed in Kansas City just last year, but it has already managed to seamlessly capture an authentic late-’70s U.K., post-punk sound. Influences for the group seem to come from all over the globe: the band credits U2, The Smiths and The Maccabees as inspirations, and the band’s name appears to be taken from the Gore Vidal-penned 1966 film Is Paris Burning? about the Paris liberation of 1944. Fitting because the songs sound like they could be off of New Musical Express’ 1986 edition of C86. The band is totally DIY, and its first official single, “Wild,” is reminiscent of Joy Division even down to the lead vocals, which sound like a cross between Morrissey and Ian Curtis.
The jangly guitars lead the song by the nose and create a vibe that makes you want to dance while scrutinizing your shoes. Fans of Joy Division, Ikon and New Order will definitely dig the darkwave sounds of Is Paris Burning.

 
Heyrocco: “Elsewhere”
Sometimes a band has a song or a sound that is very similar to another band, yet it manages to do such a good job of recreating that style in a song that it gets away with it and still seems authentic.
Heyrocco is one of those bands, and “Elsewhere” is one of those songs.
It wouldn’t be a far-off assumption that the composition instructions of “Elsewhere” are on page 213 of the widely popular How To Sound Like The Strokes: Part I. In all seriousness, The Strokes is one band from the last 15 years that is completely underrated, getting virtually no credit for all the bands, scenes and music styles that it spawned and/or revived.
A lot of imitators came out after The Strokes, but few managed to have the “it” quality that The Strokes did. Though some groups evoked eye rolls and gags because of their blatant Strokes derivation, some bands were able to pull off the sound and make it their own, and “Elsewhere” is a song by a band that does just that. The track is upbeat and peppy, with the Strokes-style guitars that follow around the lead singer’s melodies like a hungry puppy.
As much of a Strokes byproduct the song may be, however, “Elsewhere” is still a solid track. The song sounds like the soundtrack to springtime and the South Carolina band (the real SC!) pulls off tight melodies and strong arrangement.
There’s a fine line between inspiration and imitation, and so far Heyrocco is walking that tightrope well.

 
Point of View: “Burner”
San Jose’s Point of View has been around since last year and its new song “Burner” is off of the band’s upcoming EP of the same name, set for release on March 29.
The South Bay band has a pop-punk sound that is redolent of the early Fat Wreck catalogue and old-school Green Day. The band mixes good old-fashioned punk rock with some ska tendencies to shake things up a bit, and lead singer Billy Bragg sounds like he could be Billie Joe Armstrong’s cousin, the resemblance is so strong. One unique element of “Burner” is that the track maintains the beat while changing tempos throughout the song, keeping things interesting and less predictable. Though this approach could easily backfire and wind up being annoying, it ends up working for this song.
Mixing ska and punk is like mixing a gin and tonic — you need the right elements and the right amounts if you want it to be deliciously refreshing. And when it’s not done well, you feel like retching it out and demanding your money back.
So far, Point of View has been serving up some pretty tasty mixes. If you’re feeling like some Suicide Machines-on-downers, Point of View is right up your alley.

The moustached, curly-haired Darwin Smith, frontman of the band Darwin Deez, leaves quite the impression on music lovers.
Known for his eccentric style, stellar dance moves and indie-rock tunes, Smith has released a multitude of songs that might bring to mind niched indie bands such as Matt & Kim and Ra Ra Riot but Smith has a sound all his own, which shines through in Darwin Deez.

After the band’s three-year hiatus Darwin Deez’s most recent album, Songs for Imaginative People, dropped just last month, and now the band is headed to The Echo on March 8.
The band’s sound is reminiscent of the songs that fill Urban Outfitters stores or offbeat Los Angeles cafes, and Songs for Imaginative People keeps the eclectic sound, incorporating wacky guitar riffs, chimes and idiosyncratic rhythms.
But interestingly enough, Smith does not reflect the zany character of his music videos or his free-spirited album covers, which are flavored by the inclusion of strange objects and visuals. Rather, his serious and pensive nature resonates in his choice of words to describe himself and his music.
“My identity came from open mic nights at a cafe. I watched people express themselves using lyrics and that’s how every Monday night I figured out who I was,” Smith said.
Still, his sense of humor shines through in his music videos. In particular, the video for “You Can’t Be My Girl” — a juxtaposition of  hilarious stock footage of glamorous models paired against Smith lingering awkwardly in the background — shows off his funny side, though Smith doesn’t take much of credit for the video itself.
“I don’t have that much of a say as far as these music videos go, but it does come down to little bits of direction from me,” Smith said.
Smith’s multifaceted persona rings true in his music, and in catchy instrumentals  in songs such as the afrorementioned “You Can’t Be My Girl” which emphasize the band’s overall creative strength.
Still, other songs such as “Chelsea’s Hotel” exhibit a deeper side of the quirky musician, incorporating slow-paced crooning and lyrics such as, “I’ve been homeless since the dimples on her simple face / And I’ve spent my fortune, I’ve torn the town apart.”
Smith attributes various gigs he was involved in before Darwin Deez, such as playing guitar for the Creaky Boards, drumming and even rapping, as the impetus behind his bold lyrical style and unorthodox musical arrangements.
Songs for Imaginative People shows off this range. Tracks such as “Moonlit” and “(800) Human” showcase his ability to craft distinct choruses while “All in the Wrist” and “Redshift” feel more nebulous with dreamy lyrics and slower beats.
Though he grew up in Brooklyn, Smith denies that his city influenced his style today, unlike most musicians from the borough. That’s not to say that his childhood in general didn’t have an impact on his style.
“When I was about eight I found my sister’s tap shoes in the class and went to town in the kitchen,” he said. “My sister and I used to have a good time dancing together.”
Now living in North Carolina, Smith devotes his time to furthering his career by touring all over the country and constantly penning songs.
“My lyrics mostly come to me when I’m sitting with my guitar,” he said. “I’ll get a little beginning of something in an organic way and then I have to make a decision whether or not I should finish it.”
He finds inspiration in other artists and doesn’t shy away from crediting the legends: Smith believes that if given the opportunity to grab a drink with any musician in the world, it would have to be Jimi Hendrix.
“There’s just so much energy around him. He seems like a really sweet guy and a really soft spoken one at that,” Smith said. “I would love to have a memory of being with him. I would really cherish that.”
Though Smith himself might not be the Hendrix of the new age yet, if you’re seeking a break from the Bruno Mars-and Justin Timberlake-occupied airwaves, check out Darwin Deez’s Songs for Imaginative People — maybe you’ll discover the oddball within you.
 
Darwin Deez will play on March 8 at The Echo in Los Angeles. Although pre-sale tickets are sold out, a limited number may be available at the door.

New Secretary of State John Kerry has been an avid opponent of the Food and Drug Administration’s ban on blood donations from individuals categorized as MSM (men who have sex with other men), and his stance would seem to bode well for those who oppose such a discriminatory policy.
But the future of the ban is unclear, and it continues today after  being upheld by the FDA in 2010.
In 1983, the FDA instated a MSM blood-donation ban, preventing all gay and bisexual men who have been sexually active since 1977 from donating blood for life. Enacted largely out of fear over the AIDS epidemic and spreading the disease, especially to hemophiliacs, this discriminatory ban is no longer necessary.
For one, blood donation tests are more accurate and thorough today, making it possible to identify red flags earlier and with greater consistency.
Moreover, banning a group of individuals, especially if they are completely healthy and HIV-free, is bigoted and unscientific. It makes sense to try and urge people who engage in risky activities to not be donors, but those individuals can be homosexual, heterosexual or bisexual; testing is the best weapon, not blanket bans.
The FDA’s policy of accepting blood donations from groups of equal, if not greater, risk of HIV infection while barring MSM highlights the policy’s arbitrary and unconstitutional construction.
The ban assumes that all gay men, and not heterosexual individuals, are inherently high-risk donors; people who engage in risky behavior, knowingly have sex with HIV-positive partners, engage in unsafe sex practices, visit prostitutes and use intravenous drugs face no sort of blanket exclusion like MSM do. There is no difference between a gay man and a straight man who engages in safe — or unsafe, for that matter — sexual activity. It does not make any sense, except as a matter of bias, to exclude one risk group completely and let others go.
In a letter to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, then Sen. Kerry stated, “ … healthy gay and bisexual men continue to be banned for life, while the FDA allows a man who has had sex with an HIV-positive woman to give blood after waiting only one year. This double standard is inconsistent and indefensible. Our current policies turn away healthy, willing donors, even when we face serious blood shortages.”
That last observation is particularly noteworthy, as the Red Cross and America’s Blood Centers urged the FDA in 2009 to lift the gay blood ban for fear that it will only exclude millions of potential donors.
A 2010 study by the UCLA Williams Institute estimated that if gay men who did not have sexual contact for the past 12 months were allowed to donate blood, more than 53,000 additional men would likely make more than 89,000 blood donations. A revised policy could help blood banks enormously, especially considering blood supply shortages are common, according to ABC News.
Lastly, the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Scotland, Wales, Sweden and Japan, in some form, allow all MSM to donate blood, while the United States lags behind in blood donation regulations. Yet since 1983, HIV transmission has decreased; there is better awareness and prevention and better testing of blood and of possibly infected individuals.
Instead of a blanket demographic ban, if a donor participated in high-risk behavior, the FDA should require a waiting period before using the blood. Screening of donors should focus on sexual behavior, not orientation, as well as any regular use of hypodermic needles.
With modern medicine quickly advancing in preventing and curing HIV and AIDs, the FDA is falling behind with outdated policies that needlessly waste potential blood donations. A man should not have to choose between his sexuality and saving lives — but as long as the blood-donation ban on MSM exists, the choice remains.

Sorry, but gay men are increasingly engaging in r isky behavior and the HIV infection rates are increasing. This is occuring in the USA, France, the UK and Australia as well as other areas. So calling to open up blood donations when HIV could take as long as 6 months to show up in a blood test is a REALLY BAD IDEA.
Why do we have blood donation? Should not only the strongest survive and reproduce (#Darwinism)?
Can you please sign and forward my petition to allow gay men the right to donate blood at http://www.change.org/petitions/u-s-food-and-drug-administration-allow-gay-men-to-donate-blood
To everyone who is reading this–
There is currently a White House  petition to reform the United States’  ban on gay and bisexual men from donating blood. The policy is ridiculous and lives can be saved if you visit the website below and sign the petition! (It only takes a minute and every single signature counts)

Thank you
Discrimination against blood donations from male homosexuals. 
The word “discrimination” is not necessarily negative, although it is often misused that way. USC Admission discriminates against applicants who lack any helpful talents, have low GPA’s and low SAT scores.  This is discrimination, but it is not unfair. The US armed forces discriminate against enlistees with low mental scores and physical disabilities that render them unfit for service. That, too, is discrimination, but it is just.
Sadly, male homosexuals have a much higher rate of AIDS and STDs than other groups. To discriminate against them by not accepting their blood donations is unfortunate, but it is fair.
Yes, I would accept a blood donation from a male homosexual, if the blood could be certified as free of disease. Apparently, though, blood donor centers cannot accept male homosexual blood donations because of the increased risks of disease, or perhaps because an excessively high cost is needed for special precautionary screening.
Sorry, Kevin, but all sorts of situations discriminate among people, and many of them are sound and wise policy.

This past week, the Obama administration made an unprecedented move in its filing of an amicus brief with the United States Supreme Court in which it encouraged the court to strike down Proposition 8. The 2008 passage of California’s now-infamous ballot initiative ensured that same-sex marriage would remain illegal under the provisions of California’s state constitution.
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
The filing, along with his interview with ABC in which he voiced his support, has contributed to Obama’s image as the “first gay president,” a title bestowed upon him by Newsweek last May.
Though his support for same-sex marriage should absolutely be commended as a huge step forward for equal rights, this progress is not all his doing. Rather than being a reflection of Obama’s superior leadership or courage, the president’s outspokenness on the issue of gay marriage parallels society’s overall shift toward tolerance and support of gay rights.
Like many Americans, Obama’s record on gay marriage has been far from flawless. When he was running for the Illinois state senate in 1996, he signed a questionnaire for a gay-friendly Chicago publication in favor of legalizing gay marriage in the state, but answered in a 1998 questionnaire that he was undecided on the very same issue. And during his successful 2004 run for the U.S. Senate, he stated that “marriage is something sanctified between a man and a woman” when discussing his Christian background.
This brings us to his tenure as president, a period which has been marked by an unprecedented support for legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide.
According to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, Americans’ support for gay marriage has increased in the past decade while opposition to it has decreased. In 2001, 57 percent of Americans opposed gay marriage while 35 percent supported it. As of November 2012, 48 percent of Americans supported marriage equality while just 43 percent stood in opposition.
Focusing on Obama’s former inconsistency regarding marriage equality is counterintuitive. Though some of his changing stances in the past were likely a function of political expediency, they are for the most part consistent with the American public’s vacillations on the very same issue.
The president acknowledged this fact in a press conference last Friday: “The same evolution that I’ve gone through is an evolution that the country as a whole has gone through, and I think it is a profoundly positive thing.”
To over-emphasize strides toward equal marriage rights for all is to understate the progress made by Americans themselves toward greater tolerance. And to term Obama the “first gay president” is anachronistic in that it ignores the significant paradigm shift that has occurred in past years; as Americans have come to recognize the absurdity of restricting marriage on the basis of sexual orientation.
Though the legal battles are far from over and there is still much to be done in advancing nationwide support for gay marriage, society has arguably reached a point where the president’s support for marriage equality should not be shocking. Instead, the public’s significant increase in support for equal marriage rights should make presidential support something to be expected.
Progress toward marriage equality should not be solely attributed to the efforts of a lone crusader who just happens to be the president, but to the increasing tolerance of a citizenry that he happens to represent.

Gays now have relationship freedom. Why would they want the state to intervene in their private matters? Is freedom so worthless as to throw it away for a few dollars in tax savings? Do gays really want to surrender their privacy for some imagined benefits? 
I guess the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.
As someone wise once told me, “If you don’t support gay marriage, don’t marry a gay.”
Problem solved.
There are so many reasons why same-sex “marriage” is not true marriage.  For example, here are 10 good ones.

Stoker begins by telling us exactly what it’s about and exactly what kind of film it’s going to be, both thematically and stylistically. “It’s only when we realize who we are do we become adults,” India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska) whispers over the opening credits sequence filled with curious close-ups, unsettling compositions, and jagged edits.
Stoker is South Korean director Park Chan-wook’s first foray into American, and for that matter English-Language, cinema.  He is one of two Korean filmmakers being poached by Hollywood, the other being Bong Joon-ho, who directed the upcoming Snowpiercer, starring Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton and also being produced by Chan-wook.
Stoker tells the story of India Stoker, an enigmatic teenager whose father, Richard Stoker (Dermot Mulroney) passes away in a fatal car accident on her 18th birthday.  On the day of his funeral, India’s mother, Evelyn Stoker, played with harrowing intensity in a chilling performance by Nicole Kidman, introduces India to her paternal uncle, Charlie Stoker (Matthew Goode).  She informs India that her Uncle Charlie will be moving in with them for… moral support. I guess.  Both India and Evelyn can’t help but be infatuated by their strikingly handsome Uncle Charlie and an incestuous love triangle ensues.  But Evelyn is more curious than she is moon-struck by Charlie.  She never even knew her father had a brother until now.
The film is littered with literary and cinematic references.  Writer Wentworth Miller, who viewers may know as inmate Michael Scofield from former hit FOX television series Prison Break, was clearly influenced by Bram Stoker’s novel, Dracula.  The set-up of the film is also nearly identical to Hitchock’s Shadow of a Doubt and even directly borrows Charlie’s name from the film.
Chan-wook, a student of philosophy in his college days, poses a thought-provoking nature vs. nurture question at the start of the film – Do we have a choice when it comes to deciding the people we grow up to be?  It’s a resounding question that’s been tackled by almost every major philosopher as well as many filmmakers and novelists, alike.  I was reminded of the popular television series, Dexter, which deals with a serial killer struggling to contain his murderous instincts.  In Stoker, we are told India’s father used to take her out on hunting trips- not because he enjoyed hunting, but because it was the “lesser of two evils.”
It’s certainly an intriguing question worthy of cinematic exploration, but this tantalizing premise was effectively squandered by a lackluster script and style-over-substance direction.  The camerawork, editing, and sound design elements were fittingly jarring in accordance with the world these characters occupy.  Cinematographer and frequent Chan-wook collaborator, Chung-hoon Chung, delivers with stunning compositions and aptly cold lighting.  The editing was purposely jumpy and far from seamless.  When listening to the soundscape, it was often difficult to distinguish between sounds imagined and those justified by on-screen actions.
But despite these effective visual and sonic elements, I simply could not relate to any of the characters.  I’m sure they weren’t “supposed to be” imitations of real life, which is fine and even common in many successful films- but these characters were stale and lifeless.  They were both written and directed one-dimensionally and I couldn’t help but feel that their callous exteriors were emotionally impenetrable.  I was never able to make enough of an emotional investment to care about India’s faith- even with her shocking finale.  Evelyn’s character felt static throughout the film and she didn’t seem to have gone through any significant transformation.  She was simply the “terrible mother” archetype from the start and we aren’t given much backstory to justify that.  I remember the characters in Chan-wook’s international hit, Old Boy, being far more dynamic and relatable and the tragic twist ending was all the more devastating because of it.  It may or may not be important to note the fact that Chan-wook directed the actors through the help of a translator due to his poor English skills.
Despite my reservations regarding Stoker, I sincerely hope this is not Park Chan-wook’s last venture into Hollywood cinema.  I think given a better-developed script, he can direct something far more compelling.  Here’s hoping Bong Joon-ho’s Snowpiercer will be a more thrilling ride.
