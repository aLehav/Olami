Love, by definition, is simply an intense feeling of deep affection; but, without direction, does love lose its magnitude? In a 2022 survey, 58% of American adults claimed Valentine’s Day as not a real special occasion. While the stereotypical nature of the holiday is romantic, who is to say it can’t be platonic or even self-indulgent? This Valentine’s season, whether you’ve been lucky enough to be hit by Cupid’s arrow or arguably luckier to have been missed, I challenge you to focus on your own self-care and ponder what it really means to unconditionally love yourself in our very conditional world. 
1. Stop comparing. 
While even I get caught up in the abysmal depths of LinkedIn posts and Instagram feeds, we must acknowledge and share in the celebration of everyone’s successes without belittling our own endeavors. Take this popular metaphor for example: a bottle of water at the USC Village Target costs $1.19, while at the Coliseum the same water is at least $5. The only difference? Location. You have the power to grow where you are planted. After all, comparison is the thief of joy, so choose to protect your peace.
2. Prolonged gratification > short term, superficial satisfaction. 
Remember Sigmund Freud? Here’s a refresher on the infamous neurologist’s theory of delayed gratification: by delaying the impulse of receiving an immediate reward to receive a more desired reward later, you are training your mentality to manage and value the time behind your endeavors. 
3. Celebrate the baby steps!
 With that being said, it’s important to give yourself credit along the way. Have you ever heard of Lacan’s theory of desire? Often, what we desire is desire itself, so the object of that desire seems empty when we get closer to attaining it. Whether it be making a vision board, checking off your to-do lists or treating yourself with a DULCE breakfast burrito, celebrate the small victories and fuel your next ambitions. 
4. Speak to yourself the way you would speak to your best friend.
 Words have power. As cliché as this sounds, words of affirmation influence us more than we think they do. 
5. Look good, feel good, do good! 
To begin this step, we must look into the mirror and not through a window. Appreciate yourself. Be proud of how far you have come. Rather than looking out a window and wishing to be someone else, look into the mirror and make a game plan to healthily accomplish your goals. 
6. Focus on your unique abilities and be grateful for the ordinary. 
Coming from someone with a chronic vision disability, I catch myself succumbing to my limitations and critiquing my shortcomings as a product of my inabilities. However, intentionality makes all the difference. Embody intentionality and you will realize the byproducts of your limitations do not compare to the results of your resiliency. 
7. Fuel your soul. 
Whether it may be bumping your favorite artist’s music, going on a run outside or finding comfort in your faith, spend intentional time with yourself. You attract what you are, so fuel yourself with the energy you want to attract. 
Even though Valentine’s Day often gets a bad rep, there is so much beauty in the sentiment in being intentional about the things and people you choose to love. In our USC bubble, the student body can easily become overwhelmed with statistics of acceptance rates, grade point averages, career opportunities, social hierarchies and socioeconomic status, just to name a few. Out in the “real world,” it is inevitable that we will encounter a magnified array of these standards of quantitative values. Here’s the interesting thing about these qualities — they are all conditional. While I will not deny that these quantitative variables more often than not grant advantages at the starting line, these seven key practices ultimately serve as stepping stones in rewriting your narrative toward your finish line.
So, smile at that stranger when you’re waiting for a salmon bowl at Seeds. Wave at your friends when you race to cross Hoover and Jefferson in time. Remind your residential, dining and custodial staff workers you appreciate them and wish your roommate a good day before you part. Call your family to say “I love you” and cherish the gift of life you have been blessed to live. This is the beauty of Valentine’s Day many neglect to acknowledge -— the beauty of loving every aspect of life unconditionally.

I recently decided to take a page out of Miley Cyrus’ book and bought myself flowers and spent a little time enjoying my own company. Miley Cyrus’ new song “Flowers” has become my own personal anthem in the last few weeks since its Jan. 12 release.
My experience of being hurt by people the other day was just a reality check that we, unfortunately, can’t control others’ actions or how they treat us. People can make us feel like we’re on top of the world. They can make us feel seen, heard and loved. But they can also tear us down and beat us up with words, sometimes, until we question our own worth. But we can control is ourselves, our reactions and how much we show up for ourselves.
With it being Valentine’s Day —  a day associated with celebrating romantic love, let’s remember to give ourselves a little love. The message Cyrus encapsulates so well in her song is a spirit of unwavering self-assurance. If you listen closely to the lyrics, you can tell her song is not about never being hurt or disappointed by people, but about picking yourself up after and knowing that you can dust yourself off and stand up stronger and taller than before. Miley is able to do this in her song not just because she loves herself — although that is a big part of it — but because she enjoys her own company. 
Forget the rest of the world and choose to be your own best friend, your own partner in crime. Instead of looking at Valentine’s Day as something you cannot be a part of because you are single, you can instead choose to see it as an opportunity. It gives you a chance to celebrate yourself and embrace self-love. If you find yourself spending Valentine’s Day alone this year, don’t let it phase you. Just fill the day with all things you love, with all the activities that make you feel good. You can try something new, take yourself out on a dinner date or splurge on yourself by buying something nice.
In the end, it doesn’t matter how you decide to go about a solo Valentine’s Day, as long as you are filling it with the things that genuinely make you happy. Personally, I have found that the first step to enjoying my own company was getting out of my head and not worrying so much about what I did not have. Instead, I focused on what I did have — myself. Cyrus is standing on her own and it only makes us admire her more. Why can’t we do the same things with ourselves, and why can’t we give ourselves the same credit we give to those we look up to? I’m a cool person regardless of whether I’m alone or with someone else. 
Until you realize your own self-worth, you’ll always be reliant on others to not only make you feel good, but to enjoy and experience life. Life doesn’t stop for us just because we don’t have the ideal people in it or because someone disappoints us. It keeps moving and can pass us by if we are not careful. We all have the capability to do the things we want to do with or without others joining us. However, it’s a lot easier when you take yourself out to do fun things and choose not to wait around for anyone. 
As Cyrus sings, “[I could] talk to myself for hours.” It all starts with being kind enough to yourself, and not taking life so seriously that you can let loose. If you want to dance then do — you don’t need a partner! If you can’t take it from me, then take if from Cyrus when she sings, “I can take myself dancing.” She definitely would not wait on anyone to start living the life she wants. 
So, if somebody in your life wants to buy you chocolates or flowers this Valentine’s Day, enjoy it! And if somebody doesn’t, that’s okay, too. Because, either way, you should still take yourself on a date. You should still take a moment to celebrate yourself and all the love you have to give yourself.

It’s finally been done. LeBron James broke Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s 38-year-old scoring record last week, becoming the all-time leading scorer in NBA history.
In all honesty, I didn’t think anyone would ever break the record. As a little kid, I would read all types of sports books and see Abdul-Jabbar’s record pop up time and time again. After reading, I remember asking my dad if he thought the record would ever be broken or if it was even possible. He told me that the record might be unbreakable, and many of the books I read agreed with him.
Granted, that was about 15 years ago when James had a measly 10,689 career points. But since then, James has achieved what in my eyes was improbable. He currently sits at 38,390 points. I wouldn’t even be surprised if he becomes the only player to get to the 40,000 mark.
It took the greatest player of our generation to break the record after playing for 20 years and more than 1,400 games. It truly is remarkable what James has been able to do for as long as he has. You could make the argument, although it wouldn’t be easy, that there are better “scorers” than James currently. But to beat the all-time scoring record, you have to be more than just an all-time great scorer — you need to have the longevity to do it.
The sheer consistency and durability that James has held well into his 30s is impressive, to say the least. James has averaged more than 25 points per game in every single one of his 20 seasons, except for his rookie year when he averaged just under 21. In his first 15 seasons, there was only one year where he missed more than eight games in a season. To beat the record, you need to have the perfect combination of staying healthy and pure dominance.
With NBA superstars playing fewer and fewer games every season, the record will be even harder for any given player to break. We live in an age of basketball where load management is king. Star players rest themselves in the regular season to stay fresh for the postseason. And with talks of shortening the NBA season, players will have fewer games to stay on pace for the record.
To really put into perspective how difficult it is for a current player to break the record, let’s take a look at Luka Doncic. Doncic is currently in the middle of his fifth NBA season and is believed by many to be the future of the NBA. He currently has 10,683 career points and a career average of 27.4 points per game, higher than James’.
If Doncic were to maintain that points-per-game average throughout his entire career and play in 1,000 more games, he would still need to score 2,432 more points to reach what James has right now. To reach those 1,000 games, he would need to play in 14 more seasons and play at least 70 games each year.
In his five NBA seasons, Doncic has played more than 70 games just once, and, to break the record, he would need to do this 14 more times until he is 38 years old. When you break it down like this, it’s clear how difficult the task really is. James is a unique player, and no one will be able to replicate this feat he somehow has managed to accomplish.
There was a reason I thought this record was unbreakable for so long, and why it took something extraordinary for it to be broken after nearly four decades. With James saying he wants to play with his eldest son, he will only continue to extend this record. In 40 years, I’ll be telling my son the same thing my dad told me: There’s absolutely no chance someone will break the NBA all-time scoring record.

The Trojans improved to 19-6 Sunday afternoon following a 60-56 overtime win against the Oregon State Beavers. After a comeback win against Oregon Friday, USC grinded out another to beat the Beaver team that is now on a six-game losing streak. 
USC jumped out to an early lead in the first quarter, leading 15-5 with 2:15 minutes left in the quarter. Sophomore forward Rayah Marshall got off to a fast start, leading the Trojans with 5 points, 5 rebounds and 2 blocks in the first quarter. But after a pair of baskets by Oregon State, the Trojans lead shrunk to five at the end of the first quarter. 
In the second quarter, the Beavers attempted to close the gap, but every time they made a run, USC responded. Graduate student guard Destiny Littleton was fouled on a 3-pointer in the closing seconds of the quarter, allowing USC to stretch their lead to 31-24 at halftime. Marshall continued to dominate the paint, cashing a double-double to go along with 3 blocks at halftime. 
But while it seemed that USC had the game in control, shooting woes allowed Oregon State to get back into the game. USC shot 25% compared to Oregon State’s 50% in the third quarter. 
“We really couldn’t hit the broad-side of the barn,” said Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb post-game. 
Compounding their offensive struggles, Marshall left the game late in the third quarter with a torso injury and did not return. In Marshall’s place was sophomore center Clarice Akunwafo, who filled the gap in the post against the larger Beaver centers. USC was able to hang on to a narrow 3-point lead going into the fourth quarter, thanks in part to second-chance opportunities created by a number of timely offensive boards. 
However, USC’s lead did not last long as the Beavers went on a 10-0 run in the fourth quarter, creating a 51-47 lead with 4:00 to go. USC’s offense continued to flounder until graduate student Okako Adika hit a huge and-one 3-pointer with 2:16 left to tie the game at 53. 
After a layup by Littleton down the stretch that tied the game at 55, the Trojans found themselves in their second overtime in three games. 
Neither team could pull away in overtime, as the score remained close throughout the five minutes. With 35 seconds left and the Trojans leading by 1, Akunwafo grabbed USC’s 16th offensive rebound of the night and put it back up to give the Trojans a 3-point lead. The Beavers then turned it over the next possession and USC hung on for the win. 
Akunwafo has not seen consistent playing time this year, but she has stayed ready regardless. On Sunday, she played an integral role for the Trojans on both ends of the floor.
“I’m just blessed to have coaches and players who believe in me and are able to trust me on the court,” Akunwafo said. “My coaches are on my side, my players are on my side.” 
Gottlieb had high praise for the sophomore center after the game.
“[Akunwafo] did a great job especially, that last offensive rebound was huge … She knows all the sets, she stays ready, she’s incredibly coachable,” Gottlieb said. “I thought she did a really good job defensively, battling [in the paint] against a terrific post player for Oregon State.”
USC’s defense and rebounding stood out. USC forced contested shot after contested shot, resulting in Oregon State shooting 38.0% from the field and coughing up the ball 14 times. In addition, the Trojans created 15 second-chance points off offensive rebounds compared to Oregon State’s 3. 
“We really emphasize boxing out,” said Gottlieb when asked about the team’s approach to rebounding. “But also we’ve been more aggressive with the offensive boards, and I think the 16 offensive boards … were huge … causing duress for [Oregon State] on the other end [of the court].”
USC did not shoot the ball well Sunday, only hitting 2-17 from three and shooting 34.0% overall from the field. But it did not matter, as their rebounding and defense carried them past Oregon State for their 19th win as they moved to 9-5 in Pac-12 play.
This win against the Beavers, followed by Friday’s win against Oregon, propelled USC into the AP top 25. They are now the No. 25 team in the country and are ranked for the first time since 2016.
The Trojans will have five days to recuperate before traveling to Palo Alto to face Stanford at 8 p.m. Friday.

Valentine’s Day can be a difficult time; breakups are inevitable, rough patches exist and being single can be annoying with all of the romantically targeted ads. But Valentine’s Day is a fantastic opportunity to celebrate platonic loved ones, and singles’ nights are a great way to build new and unexpected relationships. 
For the world of ads and marketing, Valentine’s Day 2023 is expected to bring in roughly $26 billion, a $2 billion increase from 2022. Maybe this comes from jewelry, engagement rings and chocolates, but this day is huge for selling fantasy and sex.
Obviously, this means lingerie and condoms — please be safe, readers — but I can’t help but yawn in the face of these annoying, flashy ads like Victoria’s Secret telling me that I can get three bras for $36 only for Valentine’s Day. 
Maybe it’s because as a woman, I feel like I am constantly getting ads about increasing my sex appeal. But I also believe it’s because in the world of fashion, sex always sells. 
Sometimes it is unintentional, as with Rick Owens’s spring 2016 show intending to create “human backpacks.” Consisting of models strapped to each other, this was immediately interpreted in a sexual way. 
Another example: Kate Moss in a mini skirt, eating a Magnum ice cream bar topless to close “Cafe Society,” Vivienne Westwood’s Spring 1994 show. The meaning of the collection was convoluted by the obvious sexual interpretation of Moss’ (deliberately) seductive performance, and so the first word people thought of was “sex.” 
While Westwood was famous for challenging the status quo, the way she approached “Cafe Society” — directly contrasting the traditional Victorian era with the mini-skirts and provocative clothing — was lost behind the headlines of “sexy, topless Kate.” 
Of course, it wasn’t Moss’ fault and this publicity is exactly what Westwood wanted — but the point is the culture and purpose of the collection immediately gets lost because an attractive woman was topless, eating ice cream in a fashion show. 
Other times, sex and fantasy is the entire purpose of the show– most obviously seen during the reign of Victoria’s Secret. 
So, what about the beauty community?
Packaging has become a vastly important part of both brand identity and brand hype — and it makes sense why. People like to own pretty things. Whether this means the iconic star shape of Mugler’s “Angel’’ perfume or the gold applicator of Hourglass’ lip treatment oil, the physical presentation of the product can either draw or deter consumers. 
I just finished a case study for my introduction to advertising class on Libresse and their RedFit, Blood Normal and Viva La Vulva campaigns, where they actively worked to shift the public’s mindset on the reality of menstrual cycles and vulvas. While initially getting their advertisements banned, they were then lifted upon further review, ultimately increasing the usage of red liquid instead of blue for advertisements discussing pads and hosted workshops for men featuring vulva cupcakes and vulva origami. Although campaigns are different from packaging, the reason penises and vaginas are not literally portrayed in the world of beauty is because while the idea and act of sex sells, anatomical genitals (often) do not.
That is, until Feb. 2, when makeup artist Isamaya Ffrench revealed her newest lipstick for ISAMAYA BEAUTY — the catch? A phallic lipstick case. 
Revealing that the idea came to her in a dream, this isn’t the first time she has played with ideas of sex and BDSM. In fact, her debut collection, INDUSTRIAL, had mascara, lipstick and serum applicators pierced with a silver septum ring. 
Directly challenging the more subtle attempts to incorporate NSFW ideas into beauty products, such as the Nar’s blush name “Orgasm,” “Deep Throat” and “Dominate,” or Too Faced’s “Better Than Sex” mascaras, the lipstick tubes weigh 10 ounces each, which is three times the weight of an average lipstick case. 
Part of this comes from Ffrench’s love for seeing beauty products as art and collectables, which is also reflected in her prices, with the new phallic lipstick costing a hefty $95. Her ideology is seen most obviously in her second collection, WILD STAR, which was decorated with gold and crystal broncos. 
Before we go any further, I want to address something quickly; the article from here discusses genitalia and its correlation to gender identity in a traditional way. Many people, however, do not identify as cisgender and that there are so many other nuances that come with gender identity and genitalia; many women don’t have vulvas, just as many men may not have penises. Gender and genitalia don’t need to go hand in hand in regards to identity, and in extension, gender identity and its subsequent expression doesn’t need to be contained to a box. This is why makeup can be one of the most freeing forms of expression and communication; it can conceal, it can enhance and it doesn’t adhere to gender norms – even when it’s phallic. 
Now, back to the lipstick.  
The lipstick is a warrior cry of feminism and celebration of the male body. It is a taking back of all the years women have been sexualized in beauty, fashion, film and art and an acceptance of the history surrounding our bodies and our control over it. Simultaneously, with the acknowledgement of women’s bodies and consensual/fair portrayal, it is a sharing of space to open conversation for men’s bodies. 
MJ Corey, a psychotherapist, and Dr. Emily Morse, doctor of human sexuality, both agreed in their interview with the Business of Fashion that this opening of space comes from an “open penis fixation” where the publication of the phallic, anatomical shape is a celebration of anatomy and literal expression of the female gaze. 
But the obvious use of penises is merely new to the beauty world, maybe because of the proximity and intimate application of the products. Despite the media buzz around Ffrench’s new lipstick, fashion has already embraced the penis; Westwood currently sells a $254 topaz pave penis waistcoat chain, Owens debuted a Paris Fashion Week collection that had male models wear garments that deliberately shows their penis, Acne Studios is selling a $290 shirt with a lace penis border that says “forever mine forever yours” on it. 
Maybe Ffrench waited for Valentine’s Day to approach before announcing the launch of her lipstick, but whether or not it was intentional, it was an incredibly intelligent move to make in a marketing lens. 
Not only is it a funny gag gift –— for those who can afford it (I personally cannot) — but it’s an incredibly unique and individual item to have. It is utilitarian art that also serves as memorabilia and, simultaneously, through social sharing, expands the item past the physical object. It is not just lipstick; it is a celebration, an invitation to open conversations on sex and anatomy and a welcoming of the penis into the space of hypersexualization. 
While I am still processing my full thoughts on Ffrench’s lipstick, I’ll leave you with this: If you’re offended by the lipstick, consider why. And if you’re not, also reflect. 
Our society has already been hypersexualized and time cannot be reversed. So, then, does the invitation of literal, anatomical genitalia only contribute more to this? If so, does this normalize and eventually de-sexualize genitalia, or will it result in more comfort of discussion and more open acceptance of sex, sexual acts and physical anatomy? 
Talk about it — maybe even tonight with your Valentine’s date.

Whether it’s the end of a long day of romantic activities or time for a casual night in, there are plenty of video games catering to the lovey-dovey couples out there. Here are some of the best two-player games for duos in any relationship, friendship or situationship.
“Pikuniku” – $12.99 on PC, Nintendo Switch, macOS, Xbox
Explore a whimsical world of intricate puzzles and wacky side characters in “Pikuniku.” Alongside its single-player adventure, “Pikuniku” contains an additional classic local co-op experience. You and your partner can play as “Piku” and “Niku,” two charming creatures with very wacky leg physics. Team up to solve a series of environmental puzzles as you race to a boat that marks the end of each level.
While the co-op mode is separate from the single-player narrative, there are plenty of fun and challenging levels to try out as a duo. Every level presents a different challenge for creative players to test out their teamwork skills with tools like “Piku” and “Niku”’s powerful kicks and grappling hooks. “Pikuniku” takes a steady and casual approach to co-op puzzle games wrapped in a cartoonishly cute exterior.
“Monster Prom” – $11.99 on PC, PS, Xbox
What’s a better way to gauge compatibility than to see how your partner handles dating a hot monster? “Monster Prom” puts a competitive spin on the dating-sim genre by pitting players against one another to score a date to the eponymous “Monster Prom” in just three weeks. As newly enrolled students at “Spooky High,” players can sabotage one another as they compete to raise their stats and money in order to impress their potential dates. 
“Monster Prom” features a cast of six dateable characters ranging from a moody, hipster vampire to a party-girl poltergeist, with plenty of equally absurd side characters intervening in your romantic endeavors. Every monster has a unique personality and backstory that will tug on your heartstrings, as well as multiple endings depending on the choices made throughout the game. Don’t have enough time for hours of romantic competition? Players can opt for a shorter thirty-minute session that only gives them a week to win over a classmate. With hilarious dialogue, full voice-acting and a vibrant art style, “Monster Prom” will bring some competitive laughter and diabolical introspection to you and your valentine.
“With You” – Free on PC
For couples on a budget, “With You” provides the satisfaction and polish of a paid game at a free price. A two-player puzzle game that requires cooperation, “With You” emphasizes the importance of communication. Players control two shape-based characters and must work together to solve each level’s obstacles by pushing each other and sticking together, literally. The simple charcoal art style creates a delightful world with some deceptively difficult puzzles.
“A Way Out” – $29.99 on PC, PS, Xbox
Coming from the developers of the award-winning co-op game “It Takes Two” is Hazelight Studios’ earlier and equally incredible game, “A Way Out.” This game tells the thrilling story of two inmates’ reluctant alliance while escaping prison. You and your partner will control the main characters: the hardened, reckless and hot-headed “Leo” and the rational, determined and level-headed “Vincent.” Albeit complete strangers, Leo and Vincent — you and your partner — have to learn how to trust each other and work together to secure their freedom.
“A Way Out” is a true split-screen co-op exclusive adventure game, based on a rich, story-driven narrative, where every step of the journey reveals a little more about each character, their backstories and beyond. At every crossroads, the game allows you to choose between doing things “Leo’s way,” typically easier but involving some sort of violence and unwanted attention, versus doing things “Vincent’s way,” usually stealthier but involving more challenging mechanics. The decisions that you and your partner make in “A Way Out” matter, offering a unique, captivating and exciting experience. 
“Kirby and the Forgotten Land” – $59.99 on Nintendo Switch
Float off on an unforgettable journey as the powerful puffball, “Kirby” and his spear-wielding partner, “Bandana Waddle Dee.” Kirby’s adventure begins when he gets sucked into a star-shaped vortex and lands in an abandoned city. He rescues a strange blue creature named “Elfilin”, who tells him that “Waddle Dee Town” was destroyed, and that all the “Waddle Dees” are held captive by mysterious beasts. Kirby then reunites with his old companion, “Bandana Waddle Dee”, and the duo set off to rescue the “Waddle Dees” and rebuild “Waddle Dee Town”. 
This adorable 3D platforming game allows you and your partner to play as “Kirby” and “Bandana Waddle Dee.” There are seven worlds of unique levels to complete, along with an assortment of mini-games and challenges throughout. As “Kirby,” you can inhale and become objects such as a car and a roller coaster, and also copy enemies’ abilities, ranging from turning into a gun-toting “Ranger” to a powerful “Tornado.” “Bandana Waddle Dee” is equally as powerful, as he expertly uses his iconic spear to combat adversaries. Work together with your partner to save the “Waddle Dees”, rebuild “Waddle Dee Town” and defeat all the bosses — including special appearances from iconic adversaries “Meta Knight” and “King Dedede”!
“We Were Here” – Free on PC | $4.99 on Xbox & PS
You and your partner get lost in a frozen wasteland and find yourselves split up in an abandoned castle. The only possession you both have left is a one-way walkie-talkie — can the two of you find your way out? “We Were Here” is a collaborative and cooperative puzzle game set in a fictional castle inspired by Castle Rock, Antarctica. The “Librarian” is confined to a secluded part of the castle while the “Explorer” roams the eerie dungeons trying to make their way back to their partner. 
Every room and puzzle challenges you and your partner to use your wits, communication and collaboration. The rooms are incredibly unique, from escaping a flooded basement to a navigating a maze in the dungeons. These puzzles can only be solved by the “Explorer”using the clues from the “Librarian.” The game takes about two hours to complete, making it perfect for a cozy night at home on Valentine’s Day. If you like “We Were Here,” check out “We Were Here Forever,” the newest release in the “We Were Here” franchise.
Whether you choose to become students at “Spooky High” or break out from a maximum security prison this Valentine’s Day, you and your duo will definitely have a great time collaborating, cooperating and communicating through these adventures.

Last week, the Department of Public Safety at USC welcomed its new leader, Assistant Vice President/Chief of Public Safety Lauretta Hill, who assumed her position Feb. 6. 
Associate Senior Vice President of Safety and Risk Assurance Erroll Southers announced Hill’s appointment Dec. 9 in a university-wide email, heralding her experience in public safety leadership roles on both the municipal and collegiate levels. Prior to joining USC, Hill was the deputy chief for the Miami Beach Police Department, the Arlington Police Department assistant chief and the chief of police at the Dallas College Police Department. 
Assistant Chief David Carlisle occupied the DPS leadership position since January 2022 following the retirement of former Chief John Thomas, who had served in the role since 2013. Thomas’ departure kickstarted a nationwide search effort for his replacement, a process that involved a 22-member committee of students, faculty, staff and community leaders, and the help of external search firm Spelman Johnson. The University narrowed the search down in April, but extended it in May and broadened the title to include the assistant VP role. 
The Daily Trojan sat down with Hill Monday morning for her first student media interview at USC to discuss her decision to pursue the position, her vision for DPS and the actions she looks to take in her first few months on the job.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Daily Trojan: What policies were you responsible for implementing and overseeing at Dallas College? How will your experience at Dallas College inform your leadership at USC?
Lauretta Hill: When I came in, I actually started the police department [at Dallas College]. There were seven separate police departments — each campus had their own —, so we had to rewrite the entire policy manual. So I had the opportunity to reset and [ask], “What do we want the policy to be? What was the best practice? What was the national standard?” 
That experience and looking at policies, bringing it here is a carryover, is transitional, because I’m able — and it’s going to be expected of me — to look at all our policies and just to make sure that they’re in line with what’s best for USC, and then they’re also in line with the best practices in universities in campus law enforcement.
DT: What actions will you take in your first 90 days on the job? How do you see DPS evolving in your first year with the department?
LH: I’m still getting used to things and looking at things and seeing how things work. It’s taking me a little while to do that. My community policing philosophy closely aligns with the ONE USC Safety Vision. My priority is to look at the Community Advisory Board report and the recommendations — I know there’s obviously some that have already been implemented — to look at those and closely align my first 90 days with implementation of that vision.
DT: The subject of police violence and overstepping has been in the spotlight in 2023 — the LAPD killed six individuals since the start of the year, among them Keenan Anderson and Oscar Sanchez, who were both undergoing mental health crises near the time of their deaths. 
Will DPS be undergoing any further reforms in critical incident response and mental wellness checks in light of these incidents? Does DPS have plans to continue or to expand the Mental Health Assistance and Response Team?
LH: The MHART team, that’s a national model. That interdisciplinary response team is what DPS and other departments around the country have been looking at as an alternative to armed response. It’s on the forefront because there’s not many departments that have it. 
We’ll be evaluating that to ensure that officers are trained, how it’s working. It is absolutely imperative that officers understand the difference in that we’re dealing with people in mental health crisis and that we need those mental health responders to go with us.
DT: The presence of armed officers at USC has come into scrutiny in the past few years in the wake of widespread police violence in the United States, with community critics saying they feel more scared than safe because of it — especially those belonging to groups disproportionately targeted by police activity. Do you have plans to alter the presence of armed officers on campus, and how do you respond to these criticisms?
LH: Having officers that have all those resources and those tools — obviously, de-escalation, just a plain meeting with nothing happening is the best result. But if something is occurring, you want to have your officers here and close and not be waiting on the Los Angeles Police Department to respond. 
You need to have all those tools available to you, from verbal — just talking, working through an incident — all the way up to potentially using a firearm and not waiting for somebody with a 15- to-20-minute response time when our students, faculty and staff need that. You want those tools to be available to us, to DPS.
DT: When your hiring was announced, Southers said he hopes you take DPS and USC security “to the next level.” What does that mean to you?
LH: To me, that means making sure that we’re integrated into USC and that everybody’s voices are heard, and that we build DPS based on the needs of people here and not what DPS wants, but based on the needs from the community that we serve.
DT: The CAB report found that 31.7% of 1,050 stops by campus officers in 2019-20 involved Black people, despite them only comprising 5.5% of the student body. Do you plan to publish statistics that track whether DPS has reduced disproportionate policing and racial profiling? What actions do you plan to take to address this issue, flagged back in 2021? 
LH: Profiling is absolutely unconstitutional and I will not tolerate it, period. Transparency is key. As I look at how we publish data, how transparent we are, you will understand that I am very transparent. I think it’s important for people to know what we’re doing, how we’re doing it, so they can review and see for themselves. I plan on erring on the side of transparency.
DT: Do you have plans to require officers to log all officer-initiated stops? That was something that was found not to be required by DPS in the CAB report.
LH: I don’t know what the process is, but I definitely plan to look at all of the digging deeper and be able to answer that a little more in-depth.
DT: How do you see DPS’ role in interacting with the University Park community outside of USC’s gates? Will DPS work to ensure the surrounding area does not suffer from over-policing and patrolling, and that community members trust DPS officers?
LH: It is absolutely imperative that we are partners and collaborate with the entire community. All our students, faculty and staff live outside of the University, so it’s really important that we are part of the entire community internally and externally. I will absolutely build those relationships. I know there’s some that’s already there. 
I want to be available. I want people around the community to know that DPS is here for them, not just on the campus, but the surrounding campuses that we’re going to serve them. It’s my goal to make sure that everybody feels that their voices are heard and that policing [and] DPS is measured on how we respond. 
DT: Are there any specific community outreach programs or initiatives that you’re hoping to lead to make sure that there’s that kind of knowledge and trust in the community?
LH: There’s a lot of national models and a lot of things that are out there, but I don’t know everything that we have here, so I want to evaluate what we have here, and then add to it. 
DT:  What drove your decision to apply to work at USC’s DPS?
LH: This is kind of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. These positions at universities, such as USC, don’t come up that often and, so, when they do, you just look at it as, “Okay, can I do something to further the department? Can I bring something that will help them move the needle to the next level?” I felt that I had some more time in me in my career. I wasn’t ready to go home.

It’s that time of the year — the season when Cupid flies his arrows, heartshaped boxes stock the shelves and campus couples come out of their hiding (Seriously, why are there so many?). For all the single people out there, though, Valentine’s Day is either a painful experience or a holiday that passes right by us, for better or for worse. But it doesn’t have to be like that. We can still appreciate the essence of what it means to celebrate love, and we can do it curled up on our couches with a good romance book in our hands. 
Listen, while Goodreads and BookTok may be your go-to sources for recommendations, there are definitely some books on there that you’ll wish you’d never spent money on. Here’s this list, instead, to help you decide on a book that deserves its place on your shelf and fills that little hole in your heart. No weird alpha males. No toxicity. Happy endings only. 
Love and Other Words – Christina Lauren
To say we’re starting off strong is an understatement. Christina Lauren — the pen name for collaborators Christina Hobbs and Lauren Billings — are the queens of romance, and this is by far their best work yet. Combining second chance romance with childhood lovers, the book alternates between the past and present. It explores how main characters Macy Sorensen and Elliot Petropoulos grow from neighbors to friends to lovers and, ultimately, strangers, until a chance reunion years later changes everything. Lauren knows exactly how to tug on your heartstrings, and there’s no one you’ll fall in love with faster than Macy and Elliot. 
Book Lovers – Emily Henry
Speaking of authors who are carrying the romance novel industry on their shoulders, Emily Henry has been killing it since she released the instant bestseller “Beach Read.” She’s since written “People We Meet on Vacation” and, now, “Book Lovers,” which stars the uptight literary agent Nora Stephens. After years of crafting heroes in her clients’ manuscripts and neglecting her own happily-ever-after, Nora moves to a small town to change her luck, but keeps running into a brooding and curt editor who she can never manage to get along with. Surprise! It’s the classic enemies-to-lovers trope. Come on, you secretly love it.
Red, White & Royal Blue – Casey McQuiston
This one’s been the talk of the town since it came out in 2019, but, in case you haven’t read it, this is your (slightly unfriendly) reminder to. In this gripping and swoon-worthy queer romance, the United States’ First Son, Alex, is forced to fake a friendship with his nemesis, Prince Henry, for PR’s sake, but their relationship evolves into a messy romance and a secret relationship they must learn to navigate under the limelight. Is a plot centered around royalty slightly pretentious? Yes. But will Alex and Henry’s sizzling chemistry and witty banter make you have to stop mid-sentence so you can scream into your pillow? Absolutely.
Loathe to Love You – Ali Hazelwood
For all the STEM majors out there, this one’s for you. Also, if you thought that there wouldn’t be any more enemies-to-lovers books here, you were sorely mistaken, because Hazelwood gives us not one, but three of them. The book is a collection of the novellas “Under One Roof,” “Stuck with You” and “Below Zero,” which are all told from the perspectives of women climbing the corporate ladder. If you’ve read Hazelwood’s “The Love Hypothesis” and “Love on the Brain,” you’re more than aware that Hazelwood knows how to write the perfect slow-burn. If you’re not familiar with her, you’re in for a ride.
Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe – Benjamin Alire Sáenz
The moving coming-of-age novel is a little bit of a departure from the easy-read romance, but more than worth the read. In the moving Stonewall Awards winner, reserved and introverted Ari’s life is flipped on its head when he meets the outspoken, easy-to-love Dante. Over the course of several years, they develop a special friendship that forces Ari to either confront himself and his sexuality or run away from the potential to love. The way Sáenz explores identity and coming into your own in the face of adulthood is breathtaking and shows us that love must be found within ourselves before it’s found with another. 
The Soulmate Equation – Christina Lauren
Since we started with Christina Lauren, it only feels right to end with one of her newer books. “The Soulmate Equation” is one of the more unique plots seen in romance and a complete breath of fresh air. Lauren’s lighthearted yet soulful writing sucks you in immediately to the world of protagonist, Jess Davis, who believes in numbers more than the probability of finding love. Everything changes when she decides to give dating one last shot through GeneticAlly — the new-and-in DNA-based matchmaking app and the only thing she trusts to help her find her soulmate. Little does she know, she’s about to have a near impossible compatibility of 98% with the man she hates most … and the founder of GeneticAlly. With twists and turns, you can rely on Lauren to deliver a steaming one-sitter that’s near-impossible to put down.
