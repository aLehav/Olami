A lack of major nationwide releases should make for a slow weekend at the box office, with just two major players heading off for the top spot. Between Need for Speed, the action-thriller adapted from the video game franchise, and Tyler Perry’s Single Moms Club, expect a slow weekend at the box office.
It seems obvious which of the two should come out on top this weekend. Need for Speed, with a strong marketing campaign that included a Super Bowl commercial, stars Aaron Paul, who has amassed a devoted following because of his critically acclaimed role in the television series Breaking Bad. The film seems full of action sequences and special effects, trademarks of many blockbusters, so some may brush it off as a weaker version of the Fast and Furious franchise. Weak critical reception likely won’t affect it too much over opening weekend, and it should do fairly well at the box office.
Tyler Perry is one of the most well-known names in the entertainment industry. His most popular films are the Madea films, although all of his other films tend to do well. The Single Moms Club stars Nia Long (Fresh Prince of Bel-Air) and Amy Smart (Crank) alongside Perry. The film should have a decent showing, but do not expect it to perform better than Need for Speed.
The weekend will also see three major limited release films. Veronica Mars, starring Kristen Bell, is the heavily publicized film notable for sparking up controversy over the website Kickstarter.  The project was funded by devoted fans of the television series, and will finally hit the big screen this weekend.  The second is Bad Words, which marks Jason Bateman’s directorial debut. The black comedy has received good critical reception thus far and looks to have a nationwide release later in the month. The third, Enemy, reunites Jake Gyllenhaal with his Prisoners director, Denis Villeneuve. Its current Rotten Tomatoes score is 81 percent, but no date has been set for a nationwide release.
300: Rise of an Empire has been making waves, and Need for Speed does not seem to have the type of momentum to break its stride. Expect the Spartan epic film to remain on top this weekend.

President Barack Obama made headlines Tuesday when he appeared for a short mock interview on comedian Zach Galifianakis’ web series “Between Two Ferns,” taking the opportunity to promote the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, the health care law that was the signature legislative accomplishment of his first term.
Both Obama and Galifianakis took joking shots at each other, with Obama comparing a third term to a third Hangover movie that “didn’t really work out that well.” Galifianakis teased Obama about his birth certificate and asked if his son would have been a “nerd” like him. The interview then took a more serious note as Obama talked about the new health care website, healthcare.gov, and jokingly suggested that Galifianakis enroll in order to get his “spider bites” checked out.
The move sparked some controversy, particularly among members conservative news media who claimed the interview was undignified for the President of the United States. In the segment Fox and Friends, anchors Elisabeth Hasselback and Brian Kilmeade referred to the move as “inappropriate” and “pretty tragic” while conservative talk-show host Bill O’Reilly said the move was “desperate” and that “Abe Lincoln would not have done it.”
But did the move really tarnish the office of the President, or is Obama simply adapting to the sweeping changes in media? In other words: Are conservatives angry at what Obama did, or angry that his words seemed to have an impact?
Since the implementation of the health care law, millions of Americans have enrolled in or switched to new health insurance plans. The interview was part of a larger campaign to increase the percentage of young people, age 18-34, enrolling in health insurance plans. The Christian Science Monitor reported that the the video had reached nearly 8 million views by 8 p.m. Tuesday and that by 6 p.m. 32,000 people had reached the healthcare portal via Funny or Die.
Appropriateness aside, it’s pretty clear that the move was effective PR, generating both awareness and site traffic from the target audience.
With the increasing fragmentation of the media market, it is extremely difficult to reach audiences through traditional means. News is increasingly disseminated through digital platforms and shared through social media rather than print, radio or television. A story is only breaking if it goes viral. Aware of this power, and the popularity of Galifianakis’ show, Obama seemingly made a calculated appearance to engage young people through a platform they could relate to.
Why, then, was this something not worthy of Abe Lincoln, as O’Reilly suggests? It becomes a question of whether the issue was his advocacy for the legislation, the fact that he gave an interview, or just criticism his comedic attempts.
Theodore Roosevelt famously coined the phrase “bully pulpit” to describe the ability of the President to use the power of his office to advocate for an agenda, something Obama explicitly states in his appearance. Even Galifianakis concedes this saying, “Let’s get this out of the way, what did you come here to plug?” Obama then launched into an appeal to young Americans to get coverage. Whether or not Obama will pursue a career in comedy after his term expires remains to be seen, but the prime motivation of his appearance was  to advance his political agenda, an established and legitimate use of his office.
President Obama has also appeared on Mr. O’Reilly’s own show, to give an interview on Superbowl Sunday, as well as the popular satirical news show, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. In addition, a long standing DC tradition is the White House Correspondent’s Dinner, a comedy night where celebrities like Seth Meyers, Conan O’Brien and Stephen Colbert have performed alongside the President.
Conservatives do not seem to mind the President telling jokes or giving interviews when it suits them, and he can hardly be expected to keep quiet about his own legislation. The logical conclusion is that they are simply angry about what he is saying, not how he is saying it. The only thing the administration is guilty of is good marketing. Conservatives should take notes, not critique.
