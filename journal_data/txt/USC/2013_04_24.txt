CORRECTION
“University station receives $1 million” (April 24) incorrectly stated that the KDFC and KUSC radio stations are the largest and most listened to stations. The article should have said that KDFC and KUSC are two of the largest and most listened to stations.
The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Moving back to The Row promises to be a new beginning for USC’s chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha.
Having been off 28th Street since fall 2011, Pike president Brad Barbagallo said the fraternity has been striving to maintain its brotherhood despite not having a central location.
“A lot of guys gave up what you would consider a normal college experience,” Barbagallo said on not having a common fraternity house. “It was weird rushing kids in random places off The Row.”
Pike continued to maintain a large chapter size of more than 70 brothers over the years they have been off The Row. Barbagallo says members of Pike faced challenges in organizing off-campus philanthropy events and date dashes since they did not have a central location.
“We were always trying to figure out how to get people to come out to events not on campus,” he said.
Mike Dwyer, a fifth-year senior and the head of pledge education for Pike for the past three semesters, said maintaining  a Greek presence without a physical house was a group effort. Dwyer said many group activities were planned to help keep the brothers’ bond strong.
“We started a Pike Disneyland invite and did VIP events at places like the Staples Center and Club Nokia so we could maintain a social schedule in the fall, apart from football,” Dwyer said.
The recruitment process was also more difficult for Pike, according to Dwyer, because the chapter had no house on The Row.
Dwyer said members particularly wanted to show that life in Pike was different from being in other fraternities.
“What we wanted was to draw people specifically to Pike,” Dwyer said. “We really emphasized that they were pledging for the brotherhood, not just for the social events.”
Barbagallo said Pike has attempted to move back onto The Row several times since disciplinary issues lost them the privilege in the spring of 2010.
“[The disciplinary issues] definitely affected us the first year or two off The Row,” Barbagallo said. “Pike has its own style, and we still have that, but we are now a more revamped chapter and are trying to be the best men we can possibly be.”
The fraternity was disbanded in 2006 when its charter was revoked by its national council. However, the fraternity rechartered in February 2009 and has since been working to once again become a part of The Row.
Though Pike will move into the house owned by the Sigma Phi Epsilon national chapter this fall, Barbagallo said Pike had previously bid for a lease on the house where Sigma Alpha Mu will be living next year as well as for the house currently occupied by Zeta Beta Tau.
When the Cal Beta chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon lost its charter from its national organization in February, Pike was able to vie for their house on The Row.
Barbagallo said Pike’s national alumni housing committees negotiated the lease with the Sig Ep national organization, which owns the house at 700 W. 28th St. He said that the bidding process with Sig Ep’s leaders was a positive experience.
“Pike appreciates all the work that the [national organization of] Sig Ep did in terms of helping us do the transition,” Barbagallo said. “Our sympathies go to Sig Ep because we know what it’s like not to have a house.”
Dwyer said Pike expects a larger pledge class in the coming fall and that the house on The Row will go a long way in accommodating the new members.
Barbagallo said he hopes the fraternity’s brotherhood will help Pike be stronger once it returns next semester.
“Through our years off The Row we were able to identify our brotherhood more than we ever were able to before,” Barbagallo said. “We are relieved and excited, and we feel really privileged because of how much hard work we put in to get this to work out.”
pike is not top tier. they look like ATO. done.
I am girl in a top tier house and for you to compare Pike with ATO is completely off-base.  I have dated Pikes and I wouldn’t be left alone in a room with an ATO for any amount of time.  I’m extremely happy for PIke and wish them the best!
OMG this is the best sweet 16 present ever!!! thanks Daddy!!!
Is this intended to be disrespectful of Pike?  It didn’t work.
Welcome back Pike!  The row needs a real frat like Pike and less pretend ones…
Pike is officially back on the row and the top tier!

A USC co-sponsored study released Monday found that there is a significant difference in how younger and older generations think about online privacy and security.
The study, sponsored by the Annenberg Center for the Digital Future and the independent company Bovitz Inc, concluded that millennials, individuals aged 18-34 years old, are more willing to share personal information as long as they receive something in return.
“Online privacy is dead — millennials understand that,” said Jeffrey I. Cole, the director of the Annenberg Center for the Digital Future. “Older users have not adapted. Millennials recognize that giving up some of their privacy online can provide benefits to them.”
As a whole, the survey revealed that those who are 35 years and older were more hesitant in their interactions online. In addition, 77 percent of those aged 35 years and older agreed that “no one should ever be allowed to have access to my personal data or web behavior,” but 70 percent of millennials agreed. Fifty-one percent of millennials were willing to share information with companies as long as they got something in return, compared to 41 percent of those over the age of 35 years and older.
For many, including Morley Winograd, a senior fellow at the Annenberg Center on Communication, Leadership and Policy, these results were not surprising.
“We’ve known the milliennials have the least concerns with privacy,” Winograd said.
Many students agree that online privacy is not one of their priorities.
“In general, I don’t really feel like I need to hide information from third- party companies or basic tracking,” said Troy Kozuma, a senior majoring in business administration. “If they send spam mail it’s a problem, but otherwise I’ve never noticed trouble.”
Other students said the lack of concern for online privacy is a sign of the times.
“Our generation is oblivious,“ said Sanford Reed, a freshman majoring in theatre. “All they care about is social media, myself included.”
Though the study has prompted some to wonder if such tracking is a violation of privacy, Winograd said the benefits outweigh the costs, noting how surveillance helped authorities catch the suspects of the Boston Marathon bombing as an example.
“People would rather be exposed and find the bomber,” Winograd said.
Erica Arnold, a freshman majoring in environmental engineering, said though she agrees that surveillance is useful for protection, it should not be abused.
“If I’m in public it’s all right, as long as they don’t abuse it,” Arnold said. “It’s OK for finding terrorists, but not for smaller crimes.”
Cole said this shift is extremely telling for the future of online privacy and security.
Susan Metros, associate CIO of technology-enhanced learning, said that protecting one’s privacy online requires common sense.
“If you put it online, you can’t assume it won’t be seen more broadly,” Metros said.
Other students said they are appalled by the millenials’ obsession with online behavior but also understand that it is unavoidable.
Bahar Rohani, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, said privacy is still necessary when it concerns friends and coworkers.
“Obviously, the stuff I put on social networks is for me and my friends,” Rohani said. “I wouldn’t want anyone I work with in a professional setting to see it.”

USC alumni Kevin Bachus and Chanel Summers donated money Tuesday to establish the Bachus-Summers Fund for Innovation in Interactive Entertainment at the School of Cinematic Arts.
The fund, which was made to the SCA’s Media and Games Division, will support scholarships for students who show interest and initiative in pursuing interactive media.
“When thinking about this fund, it was critical to us that it be used directly to support the efforts of tomorrow’s creative and entrepreneurial leaders,” Summers told the USC Interactive Media Division blog.
SCA’s Interactive Media and Games Division has been recognized as the No. 1 game design program in North American by the Princeton Review in the last three years. The division offers a Bachelor of Arts in interactive entertainment and a Master of Fine Arts in interactive media. The multidisciplinary faculty encourages students to design, create, research and collaborate on projects.
Bachus, one of the co-creators of the Xbox, works as senior vice president in entertainment and game strategy at Dave & Buster’s, Inc. After graduating from the university in 1990 with a bachelor’s degree in cinema-television production, he held jobs at companies such as Bebo, Nival Interactive and Capitol Entertainment Group.
Summers helped to design video games and platforms for Microsoft, including the internet game Fighter Ace, as well as Xbox. She currently works for Syndicate 17. Summers also lectures part-time at SCA.

Rob Caughlan, the founder of Surfrider Foundation and Friends for the River, emphasized Wednesday the power of student advocacy in solving environmental issues, such as oceanic pollution.
Surfs up · Robert Caughlan, founder of the Surfrider Foundation, discusses Wednesday how students can contribute to the environment. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
The event was hosted by the Program Board’s Political Student Assembly and was held in The Forum of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Caughlan shared his firsthand experience about how he was the plaintiff of the second-largest clean-water enforcement victory in the nation’s history and also gave insight on his journey riding the environmental “green wave” from its start in the 1970s.
A leader in the American environmental movement who produced multiple educational documentaries about population growth, endangered wildlife and solar energy, Caughlan said a simple love of the environment led to his activism.
“I got involved in the environmental spectrum because I fell in love with the ocean,” Caughlan said. “As a former surfer, I see things in a surfer’s perspective. I think these environmental challenges we face are big waves coming at us, and we either learn to ride them, or we get wiped out by them.”
Caughlan said students must harness their passions to create a healthier world.
“It took me about eight years, but I’m glad I produced [documentaries],” Caughlan said. “Money shouldn’t be the ultimate goal. Your goal should be higher than money. We’re creating the problems, so we have the responsibility to advocate for and solve them.”
Students spoke about their experiences at the event as well. ‘11 alumnus Chris Sanchez and ‘12 alumnus Armand Aghadjanians are two Trojans who exemplify the traits Caughlan was speaking about. They have worked to launch a new environmentally friendly clothing line called Greentag.
“We had this idea at USC together, and what we have since then is a new form of eco-clothing with new sustainable production,” Aghadjanians said.
Both alumni said they realized that the environment plays a large part in the lives of millions of people and have found passion through that idea.
“We’re all really affected by environmental issues,” Sanchez said. “It doesn’t matter whether you live in the big city or out by the beach. Environmental issues affect all of us.”
Other students who attended the discussion expressed a similar passion about solving global environmental issues.
Ivan Kumamoto, a freshman majoring in business administration and co-director of the Environmental Affairs Organization on campus, took inspiration from Caughlan’s talk about taking action and fighting to help the environment.
“Once you find that part of nature that you love, that you’re passionate about, the whole fight makes it so much easier,” Kumamoto said. “Once you have a reason to keep fighting, that’s what keeps you going. He’s just a very inspiring and knowledgeable person.”
Caughlan’s appearance is part of Earth Week at USC. A variety of environment-related events, including the Recycled Fasion Showcase, the Environment Fail and the Campus Eco-Tour have been held in honor of Earth Week.
Krishna Rajagopalan, a sophomore majoring in communication, emphasized the need for Earth Week events such as Caughlan’s environmental discussion.
“It’s an issue that is really important to address,” Rajagopalan said. “By having all these Earth Week events, it really gets the word out to the public.”
Overall, Caughlan’s discussion was not only about advocating environmental issues, but also about life lessons for students looking to find passion in something they can believe in.
“I’m hoping you’ll use education to do something important with your life,” Caughlan said. “If surfers can make a difference, anyone can.”

Doo Dah Day Parade
Saturday, April 27, at 11 a.m.
2500 E. Colorado Blvd.
Pasadena
Let your freak flag fly at the 36th annual Doo Dah Day Parade in Pasadena. The parade, considered to be the public face of the “high weirdness” that manifests itself through the Pasadena area, promises to be a day full of wacky and quirky fun. Some of the silliest marchers on the parade route include the BBQ & Hibachi Marching Grill Team (which cooks hot dogs along the parade route and then shoots them from “brat-zookas” into the crowd) and the robotic spitting cat named Boo-Boo Kitty (reportedly, in the cat’s final appearance). With so much lighthearted silliness, by the end of the day, you too might find yourself whistling to the namesake of the festival. “Camptown races sing this song, oh the dooh-dah day,” indeed.

The most popular literary event in California has finally ended.All across campus, the classic white tents from the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books have been packed away, and attendees at last weekend’s event have traded crowded Trousdale book stands for routine stop-and-go L.A. traffic. As they finish shelving their literary spoils and return to the normality of their daily lives, the Festival of Books becomes a distant memory, something to reflect on fondly as they wait for news of next year’s event.
Attendees haven’t, however, forgotten the insights and advice their favorite authors had to offer, especially if that author challenged everything they knew about literature.
Sunday’s panel with best-selling author Jamaica Kincaid was one such earth-shattering event. As Kincaid discussed her most recent work, See Now Then, traditional expectations of literature were thrown aside. The most innovative novels, it seems, are those that break with literary norms, forging their own voices as creative interpretations of the written word.
See Now Then follows the disintegration of a marriage between Mr. and Mrs. Sweet, two inhabitants of a domestic New England world. In her novel, Kincaid plays with notions of time and perspective, ultimately recreating reality as the reader knows it. And with her history of playing with prose-poetry and nonfiction, Kincaid is probably one of today’s most flexible authors, fully equipped to handle a novel of epic literary proportions.
Still, See Now Then has met strong condemnation from the critical community. Aside from its unwarranted frustration with the “autobiographical” context of the novel — some reviewers have drawn parallels between the end of Mr. and Mrs. Sweets’ marriage and the end of Kincaid’s marriage to her former husband, Allen Shawn — many critics have complained about the overt style of the novel. In the words of The New York Times reviewer Dwight Garner, in an article titled “The Marriage Has Ended; Revenge Begins,” Kincaid’s See Now Then is a “bipolar novel [that is] half séance, half ambush.”
“See Now Then has run-on sentences, few paragraph breaks, no real plot and little in the way of dialogue,” Garner wrote. “In a recent interview Ms. Kincaid maintained that her book’s primary subject was time itself. This is painful to absorb, because See Now Then becomes self-consciously clotted and grandiose whenever the subject of time heaves into view. You will have to back up and reread many of the sentences here just to be certain that she isn’t, in some regard, attempting satire.”
When he’s not chastising Kincaid for using her husband as source material or writing a novel that “frequently peels away into baroque fantasy,” Garner complains about Kincaid’s unique approach to See Now Then. For Kincaid, such attitudes are hardly new but frustrating nonetheless.
As an author whose first work, Girl, has bounced between the poetry and prose genres, Kincaid is used to having her work defy categories. Still, she told panel attendees on Sunday that See Now Then, which features elaborate poetic language, has been critically dismissed as a novel. Instead, some reviewers have considered it a masked autobiography. Kincaid said on Sunday, however: “Please allow me to assert with confidence that I’ve written a novel.”
“It’s not a book in the usual way of and then and then and next. It doesn’t have what you’d call a traditional structure or a traditional narrative. But it’s very structured, it’s very mannered, actually, in the way your mind might work,” Kincaid told NPR. “I mean, I’ve come to think that the traditional way of writing is the artificial way that that’s not the way things work at all. It’s not the way thinking works.”
And she’s absolutely right. Why, when we pick up novels, do we expect conventional modes of storytelling, all of which involve a strict linear structure with a beginning, middle and end? Do we expect novels to maintain an almost mathematical structure?
The answer, plain and simple, is “of course not.” When we look at works that have earned our attention, the most successful pieces of literature have played with literary conventions, capturing our hearts as they bring something new to the blank page.
Toni Morrison, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993, has long dabbled with traditional literary methods of time and space. Beloved employs a stream-of-consciousness style that offers much to the reader who’s willing to look a little deeper into the material. Likewise, Jazz plays with an unusual narrator, and Love has a very specific nonlinear style. None of these innovative methods cost Morrison when it was time for her to collect the Pulitzer Prize or the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
But dismissals of conventional style are common among other authors we revere most. Virginia Woolf dismissed Western literary traditions as early as 1925 with the publication of Mrs. Dalloway. Isabel Allende, whose most recent novel Maya’s Notebook hit shelves Tuesday, merged food recipes, paintings and prose in Aphrodite: A Memoir of the Sense. e.e. cummings broke the poetry norms when he published poems written completely in lowercase and used a deliberate syntax that mimicked the rhythm of his subject matter.
It’s important to remember then that the art of telling a good story is not bound by any particular rules or norms. Being human is a messy endeavor and relying on neat storytelling conventions destroys the beauty of that experience.
Perhaps Kincaid said it best in the final moments of Sunday’s panel: “To be human … to exist. … It’s a disaster.”
And unconventional literature, it seems, is the best way to capture that.

Justin Casale-Savage and Tony Moras have the body language and easy laughter reminiscent of laid-back SoCal surfers, but there’s more to this duo than meets the eye.
Sprokk it · Sprokk’s bold orange and blue logo is meant to encourage people to say what’s on their minds. The new app allows users to send their friends up to 17 seconds of audio with a photograph. – Courtesy of Tony Moras
 
Despite their easy-going attitude, Casale-Savage and Moras are two 28-year-old Southern California entrepreneurs on a mission to transform the way people communicate through their new social networking app, Sprokk.
“We want people to reconnect in a genuine and authentic manner,” Moras said. “Voice captures inflection and tone. Snapchat, Instagram and the other things out there right now don’t do that.”
This new app gets its catchy moniker from the Dutch language and literally translated, it means “speak.” Sprokk encourages voice-sharing by allowing folks to record up to 17 seconds of audio, paired with a photograph. Users can tag friends on posts or respond to other posts with a voice recording of their own. Though Facebook users are constrained to only “liking” and commenting on content, Sprokkers can hit “boo,” “LOL” or “fancy” to show their appreciation or distaste for voice recordings.
Exploring Sprokks’ posts reveals that users have been using the app to upload everything from serious to candid to comedic moments of life.
Though Sprokk is a fledgling company with a much smaller user base than Twitter or Instagram, this startup is growing with the help of its young staff. They currently employ several USC students who, as interns, serve as campus ambassadors.
These ambassadors, along with the rest of the team, apply unconventional marketing techniques to promote their brand.
In order to bolster the company’s likeability, one ambassador suggested that Sprokk deliver Sprinkles cupcakes along with Sprokk promotional items to sorority houses. That suggestion was quickly turned into reality.
“We’ve allowed the [students] to come up with the ideas,” Moras said.
Perhaps it is this youth-based marketing approach that will lead Sprokk to its success.
“We’re the old guys. We give the [students] the opportunity and freedom to do what they want with our product,” Casale-Savage playfully chimed in.
Aside from Moras and Casale-Savage, the company is run by Matthew Sanger and Kevin Ritter, all of whom exercise a sunny management style. Ambassadors and employees wear what they want to work and network with college students through social events.
“Working for the Sprokk team is really rewarding. The guys are young, funny and super easy to talk to,” said Layla Aberi, a  campus ambassador for Sprokk. “They have a clear business idea and want to hire people who share their enthusiasm.”
According to Aberi, Sprokk doles out significant creative powers to its current employees.
“I brought a large version of the Sprokk logo to Las Vegas and had a ton of people wear it [on their head] so everyone was curious what that head was all about,” Aberi said. “It definitely sparked people’s curiosity.”
Another on-campus promotional strategy by the Sprokk team was the hosting of a competition to see which sorority house can get the most downloads. The $1,000 prize money for this year went to Delta Gamma, which will donate the prize to its charity of choice, Service for Sight.
“We want to talk directly to people. It’s different from what the bigger companies do. We’re all about the grassroots,” Casale-Savage said.
In addition, Moras and Casale-Savage credit Tinder, FourSquare and other innovative web firms as inspiration for their creativity.
Though Sprokk still hasn’t achieved household-name status, one can’t help but love the product’s purpose.
“It’s a new form of communication, so it’s going to have to get over a few hurdles,” Casale-Savage said. “We want you to live out loud.”
One of my favorite apps!

Have you ever wondered what the walls around you would say if they could talk? The age-old question is finally answered in Crumble (Lay Me Down, Justin Timberlake). Having an apartment cast as a role in the play is only the tip of the iceberg in this bizarre and dramatic comedy by Sheila Callaghan and now playing at Theatre 68 in Hollywood.

Crumble, which blends original plot devices — the personified apartment and dream-like appearances of teen idols Justin Timberlake and Harrison Ford — investigates how a family grieves and how they will stop at nothing to restore order in their lives. Though it’s a bit kooky, the compelling mother-daughter-apartment relationship will keep you on the edge of your seat.
Crumble follows the life of twisted and disturbed Janice (Shelly Hacco), as she and her eternally fretting mother Clara (Heidi Rhodes) struggle to come to terms with the shocking death of Janice’s father one year prior.
They sometimes receive advice from Aunt Barbara (Julianna Bolles-Morrison), who draws her extensive parenting advice from caring for her 57 cats. Their story is accompanied by the Apartment, played by Stephen Kline, a lovable but diabolical presence that pleads with them to repair him, while also threatening to destroy their world.
The most haunting moments are centered around Hacco, who plays a convincing 11-year old oddball who creates satanic tea parties for her dolls. It is difficult for the audience to relate to her demented conversations with herself and the twisted plan involving chemicals and thermometers, which is never fully explained until it is too late. Part of this can be blamed on the writing, as her dialogue and behavior seems unrealistic for a girl barely out of elementary school, if even. Hacco commits well, but the character leaves many unanswered questions.
Rhodes and Bolles-Morrison as the mother and aunt, are  sympathetic characters in the play. Both deeply care for and are concerned about Janice, but express this in different ways. Unfortunately, both actors are unable to transform their characters. Clara is portrayed as weepy and incapable, and Barbara is way too crazy to be considered a reliable source of advice. It leaves the audience even more concerned for Janice, as she has only these two insufficient guardians.
The most entertaining and relatable character is, surprisingly, not a person at all, but rather the Apartment. Kline is no “wall” flower — his extremely physical performance has him coming in through the ceiling, perched on top of mantles, crawling from under the floorboards and popping out of cabinets. His entrances provide a nice sense of stability, just as his stubborn comments help anchor the other characters as they spiral out of control.
The set adds to the performances, depicting several rooms in varying stages of disrepair. The house is supposed to be a grand mansion that has fallen from grace. It is very detailed and cluttered but doesn’t seem polished. There is a feeling of cramped creepiness; it not just a large mansion that hasn’t been painted in a while. Still, the theater should be applauded for its creative use of space, as it is clear the stage is quite small.
The choice of music between scenes forces the audience to remain fixed in the “creepy” mood of the play. The odd, dissonant futuristic tones do nothing to further the story, instead reminding the audience that this is a weird situation. It furthers the one-dimensional performances of the actors and keeps it from becoming a full and layered production.
But these critiques are not to say the production was not entertaining. Audience members sat at the edge of their seats to find out what happens with Janice’s devious secret plan.
There are some wonderful comic moments with the Apartment and the interactions with the imagined versions of Justin Timberlake/Harrison Ford, but there are also touching scenes between mother and daughter. It brings everyone back to their own preteen years, struggling to come to terms with so many aspects of life.
Strip the play of all its craziness and universal struggles emerges  that everyone deals with: death and discovering what it means to love. At the end of the day, Crumble is a coming-of-age story about the power of love: love for a celebrity, love for your family, love for your home and love for your own life.
 
Crumble (Lay Me Down, Justin Timberlake) runs through May 18 at Theatre 68 in Hollywood, Calif.

Following a dominating win over rival UCLA in the regular-season finale, the USC women’s tennis team appears to have hit its stride at the right time as it heads into this weekend’s Pac-12 championship tournament.
The win over the No. 7-ranked Bruins put the finishing touches on an outstanding regular season for the Women of Troy, who finished the 2013 regular season campaign at 21-2 overall and an extraordinary 9-0 in conference play.
USC head coach Richard Gallien said he was extremely pleased with the effort that his players put forth and believes that the win over their crosstown rivals will do nothing but boost the girls’ confidence entering the last stretch of the season.
“The girls are deservedly really happy.” Gallien said. “We’re winning because of great attitudes, and they’ve competed extremely well all year.”
The Women of Troy will continue to compete hard this weekend in Ojai, Calif., as they participate in the Pac-12 conference tournament. The event differs from other tournaments the team has played in this season in that it has no team implications. It is solely about individual rankings, which have no bearing on team seeding in the NCAA tournament.
As a result, senior Danielle Lao and sophomore Sabrina Santamaria are being held out of the tournament to give them some rest before the NCAAs start next month.
In Lao’s absence, sophomore Zoë Scandalis will be playing as the top singles player for the Women of Troy, which provides a huge opportunity for the young player, who is ranked No. 32 in the country.
“We really want the girls to focus on their individual performances,” Gallien said. “If Zoë were to win the tournament [out of the No.1 spot], that would be a big deal.”
As for the team’s health, the Women of Troy seem to be in top shape heading into the final phase of a long season. Santamaria and Lao are “a bit dinged up,” according to Gallien, but the rest this weekend should cure any minor health issues they might be dealing with.
“All sorts of ingredients go into winning a championship, but we need to be healthy,” Gallien said. “Right now, we are, which is one of the reasons we decided not to play Danielle [Lao] or Sabrina [Santamaria]. Playing that high in the lineup is very taxing physically and emotionally.”
All in all, it is clear that, though USC would love a great performance this weekend and is encouraging its players to compete hard, the focus is definitely on reclaiming the top spot nationally in the NCAAs. The Women of Troy entered the match against UCLA ranked No. 5 in the nation, but the win, especially because it was done in such dominating fashion, could push them into the top four and guarantee them a No. 1 seed in the tournament.
But even with that mindset, Gallien is not concerned with the possibility of his team not giving this tournament its best effort, which is something that has been an issue.
“Early in the year, we were struggling because we were complacent,” Gallien said. “I don’t think it’s going to bite us again. The finish line is close here and if someone beats us, they’re going to have to play very well. We’re not going to fall asleep.”
If that is true, then the Women of Troy should be bringing home some hardware next week.

When center Dewayne Dedmon announced Wednesday that he was forgoing his senior season and entering the NBA draft, you couldn’t help but wonder what new head coach Andy Enfield thought of the move.
Many believe there is a very small chance that Dedmon, who averaged 6.7 points and 7.0 rebounds per game last season, will get drafted. And Enfield, with four years of NBA coaching experience, must have known this before Dedmon made his decision.
But my guess is that Enfield’s primary concerns were with his own team, not Dedmon’s potential next one.
Enfield arrived in Los Angeles with one main goal: to generate some excitement about the USC basketball program that has been anything but exciting in recent years. Florida Gulf Coast’s “Dunk City” moniker has inevitably followed Enfield to the West Coast, and in his introductory press conference, Enfield expressed his desire to continue his fast-paced, above-the-rim style at USC.
But with Dedmon’s announcement, Enfield’s plans might need some re-thinking.
At FGCU, much of the credit for the Eagles’ high-flying style was given to senior captain Sherwood Brown and point guard Brett Comer, who led the team in scoring and assists, respectively. But FGCU’s thunderous throw downs were only made possible because of bigs, such as Chase Fieler and Eric McKnight, who could run the floor and make dynamic finishes off of lobs and no-look passes.
The only player the Trojans had who fit that description just left the building.
In Dedmon, USC had a player that fit perfectly into Enfield’s style. Already at 7-feet tall, his long arms, leaping ability and strong motor would have made him an alley-oop waiting to happen in an up-tempo system. Now, though, the Trojans will struggle to find players who fit that type of play.
Junior center Omar Oraby figures to see the biggest increase in minutes, but he struggled with stamina last season and implementing a fast pace would only seem to make it tougher for him to stay on the court. And forcing him into playing more when he’s fatigued would make Oraby an even bigger liability on defense, where the Cairo, Egypt, native averaged 2.1 fouls per game despite playing only 14.6 minutes per contest.
After Oraby, the cupboard gets pretty bare in the frontcourt. The next-tallest player on the team is 6-foot-9 freshman Strahinja Gavrilovic, who played just 11 total minutes last season and is very much an unknown. Next is freshman Zach Banner who, also at 6-foot-9, is an offensive lineman for the football team and, at a listed weight of 335 pounds, should not figure to take well to Enfield’s style.
After those two, redshirt junior Ari Stewart is the team’s only forward. At 6-foot-7, he could be a valuable stretch-four and will most likely thrive in an up-tempo system, but having such an undersized player at the power forward position would be a huge detriment.
As far as incoming players are concerned, the only big man that USC has signed for its 2013 class is Nikola Jovanovic of Serbia. He’s 6-foot-10 but, at only 215 pounds, should not be expected to make large contributions during his first season with the program.
So what is Enfield going to do now that one of his main assets has left? I think he should stay the course. “Dunk City” might not happen for the 2013-14 season, but the best thing for an undersized team to do is run, run and run some more, and that’s still Enfield’s main goal.
USC definitely still has the personnel to get up and down the floor, with Stewart, junior guard J.T. Terrell (who made his share of highlight-reel dunks last year) and sophomore guard Byron Wesley all coming back next season. The Trojans also have a pair of freshman guards returning in Chass Bryan and Brendyn Taylor, as well as a trio of incoming perimeter players in Kahlil Dukes, Julian Jacobs and Gatorade California player of the year Roschon Prince.
But this team still has plenty of struggles ahead of it. USC had the luxury of three seven-footers last season, and that number has now dwindled to one. Having the ability to essentially use Dedmon and Oraby as a platoon at center instantly gave the Trojans a leg up on every other team, but now they are left with only one experienced big man who might not even fit in with Enfield’s style.
In addition, the Trojans will break in a new starting point guard next season with the loss of team captain Jio Fontan, but no one knows exactly who that will be. FGCU had Comer to run the show and figuring out who will play that role at USC next season should still be Enfield’s top priority.
Fans should still be excited to see what Enfield can do with this small-ball type of lineup, but if they are expecting to see Dunk City take over the Galen Center, they might just have to keep waiting.

In wire-to-wire fashion, the USC women’s golf team blew away the rest of the field in the 2013 Pac-12 championship tournament. The team had a blistering first round and finished just as strong to post the only under-par round in the field en route to an eye-popping 24-stroke victory.
Annie Park became the third consecutive USC freshman to win an individual conference title on Wednesday while leading her team to its third Pac-12 championship in the last six years. Park’s final-round 3-under 69 held off teammate Sophia Popov, who took sole possession of second place. The junior shot a third-round 2-under, finishing just short of a record sixth win. Stanford’s Mariah Stackhouse and Colorado’s Jennifer Coleman tied for third.
The second-place finish was Popov’s fifth consecutive top-10 finish and sixth overall this season. The championship for Park was just her second win of the year, with her first coming at the Bruin Wave Invitation on March 5.
“Annie played great today and finished strong,” USC head coach Andrea Gaston said. “It’s really neat to have three-straight freshmen win the Pac-12 individual title.”
The Women of Troy once again benefited from strong play from their entire team, with four players finishing in the top 10. Sophomore Doris Chen’s 1-over performance was good for seventh place, while junior Rachel Morris’ 2-over was good for 10th. Morris and Park both shot 69s tying for the final-round lead.
In the less-than-dramatic team championships, No. 10 Washington overtook No. 7 UCLA for second place. The host Bruins faded on the final day, finishing two strokes behind the Huskies and nearly 30 behind the Trojans. No. 8 Arizona and No. 12 Stanford tied for fourth place. The win is the team’s fifth of the season, tying a team record.
“It was a great team win,” Gaston said. “We wanted the girls to get off to a quick start today and that’s exactly what they did.”
The Women of Troy now look ahead to the NCAA tournament, in which they are sure to be favorites to win their first national championship since 2008. Of the 21 first-place votes in the latest NCAA poll, the squad received 17. USC is hoping to avoid repeating last year’s result at the NCAA championship, when the team suffered a devastating one-stroke loss on the final day of competition.
The NCAA championships are set to begin May 9 at a site to be determined.
That’s not Annie Park in the picture.  That’s for Trojan Golfer Inah Park.

The “Dunk City” era at USC will now have to begin with a new starting center.
So long · USC junior center Dewayne Dedmon averaged just 7.1 points and 6.4 rebounds in his college career, yet he hopes that he can impress NBA scouts during pre-draft workouts enough to be chosen in the 2013 NBA draft. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
 
On Wednesday, junior 7-footer Dewayne Dedmon announced that he is leaving USC to declare for the NBA draft.
“It’s just my time to chase my dream and go to the NBA,” Dedmon said in a statement released by USCTrojans.com. “I had a great time at USC and it was a good experience. I had some ups and downs and learned a lot and believe it is best for me to turn professional at this time.”
NBADraft.net projects Dedmon will go 47th overall in its 2014 mock draft but did not have him getting picked in the 2013 draft. The draft site DraftExpress.com does not have Dedmon being drafted in its 2013 or 2014 mocks.
Dedmon played two years at USC after transferring from Antelope Valley College, averaging 7.1 points and 6.4 rebounds per game in 51 career games for the Trojans.
The 7-footer’s high-flying athleticism and ability to run the floor would have fit well with new head coach Andy Enfield’s frenetic “Dunk City” playing style. Enfield was hired on April 1, and Dedmon attended the first team meeting on April 3 and had reportedly been present at some offseason team workouts in the past few weeks.
Junior center Omar Oraby is expected to take over the full-time starting role, as 6-foot-7 redshirt junior forward Ari Stewart and 6-foot-9 freshman forward Strahinja Gavrilovic should see increased playing time with Dedmon gone.
Dedmon led the Trojans with 7.0 rebounds per game in 2012-13 to go with 6.7 points per contest. After struggling to score in the early part of the season, Dedmon had the best stretch of his career toward the beginning of USC’s conference slate, averaging 10.8 points, 8.4 rebounds and three blocks per game in a five-game stretch.
He scored a career-high 18 points against Washington on March 6 but was suspended indefinitely on March 12 following a reported Saturday night incident in downtown Spokane between USC players and local bar patrons. Spokane police are still investigating the case.
USC lost 69-66 to Utah in the opening round of the Pac-12 tournament two days after the suspensions were announced, with Dedmon and also-suspended senior center James Blasczyk not making the trip to the tournament. The Trojans finished the season with a 14-18 record.
Dedmon averaged 2.1 blocks per game in 2012-13, good for second in the Pac-12 and the sixth-best single season total in USC history, and finishes ninth in program history with 85 career blocks. He also led the Trojans with 1.1 steals per game.
Turning 24 in September, Dedmon is the oldest early entrant into the draft. Because of religious reasons, he did not play organized basketball until his senior year of high school in 2007-08 at Lancaster High School in Lancaster, Calif. Dedmon is a Jehovah’s Witness and his mother did not think he should focus on basketball in his youth.
He played in 2009-10 for Antelope Valley and transferred to USC the next year. He was proclaimed a surefire first-round pick by then-head coach Kevin O’Neill in 2011, but he struggled to develop an offensive game and also missed the last 11 games of the 2011-12 season after injuring his left knee.
Despite O’Neill’s high praise upon watching Dedmon practice, the 7-footer never quite lived up to the expectations. At times showing flashes of stardom, his USC career was mired in inconsistencies. He was often in foul trouble and never averaged more than 23.3 minutes per game.
Though many doubt that he will actually be chosen, Dedmon is hoping to be the first Trojan selected in the draft since Nikola Vucevic was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers with the No. 16 pick in the 2011 draft. There are currently five former Trojans in the NBA: Vucevic, DeMar DeRozan, O.J. Mayo, Taj Gibson and Nick Young.
The 2013 NBA draft will take place on June 27 and, for the first time, will be held at the Barclay’s Arena in Brooklyn, N.Y.
First off I want to say fantastic blog! I had a quick question in
which I’d like to ask if you don’t mind. I was curious to find
out how you center yourself and clear your thoughts prior to writing.
I have had trouble clearing my mind in getting my ideas out there.
I do take pleasure in writing however it just seems like the
first 10 to 15 minutes are generally lost just trying to
figure out how to begin. Any recommendations
or hints? Many thanks!
Way too bad but maybe Dedmon’s career at SC was over, anyway.  He badly needs another year of basketball development at the college level, not to mention a chance to do some growing up.

Media outlets must ensure that their reporting is accurate and factual instead of chasing scoops.
Alan Hung | Daily Trojan
This highlights a glaring problem of the 24-hour news cycle: The media has abandoned its fundamental responsibility to report accurately. But what’s so mystifying about this abdication of duty is that it is pointlessly self-destructive.
People turn to news sources for information. They are looking for facts and they are looking for the truth, particularly during times of crisis. In the eyes of many, the media fails when it disseminates inexact information.
Journalist David Grann said on Twitter, “History does not remember if you reported something first by two minutes. It does remember if you got it wrong.” As an institution that is based on reporting the facts, news media shouldn’t need to be reminded of this.
Yet, for some reason, it’s still a problem.
Part of this has to do with the financial pressures that news media face — particularly in the hyper-competitive atmosphere of 24/7 reporting. Newspapers and news networks are businesses and therefore face constant pressures to remain profitable. And these profits relate directly to the size of their audiences. So the guiding idea seems to have become that if an outlet is always first to break a story, then that outlet will generate the greatest profit and attention.
In theory, this seems logical enough, but in practice this has not proven to be the case.
Instead, it is a mindset that has failed repeatedly and weakened journalism as an institution. A report published by the Pew Research Center in 2009 reveals a steady decline in peoples’ belief that news media “gets the facts straight.” As of 2009, this number was at a staggeringly low 29 percent.
Counterarguments hold that in times of crisis, it’s inevitable that a story will change as new information becomes available. During such emergencies, it is not necessary that every little detail be accurate, but that people at least understand what immediate dangers still exist.
But the erroneous arrest reports from last Wednesday failed at even this basic level.
Within an hour of CNN “breaking” the story, the FBI issued a press release reprimanding the media for these false reports. It concluded the press release with the following request: “Since these stories often have unintended consequences, we ask the media, particularly at this early stage of the investigation, to exercise caution and attempt to verify information through appropriate official channels before reporting.”
By falsely telling the public that an arrest had been made, the media put the public in danger. It told them that the threat that had been hanging over the country’s head for two days had been removed when really, it hadn’t.
Besides that, the media has failed at reporting even in non-crisis situations. During the Supreme Court’s 2012 review of Obamacare, CNN and Fox News mistakenly reported that a key portion of the bill had been overturned. In the rush to be first, they reported the exact opposite of what had happened.
Following the false arrest reports on Wednesday, Jon Stewart delivered a scathing criticism of CNN, concluding the opening segment of that night’s Daily Show by describing it as “the human centipede of news.”
In the age of 24/7 news and the race to grab scoops, this is what the news media has been reduced to, and everybody — including the media themselves — is suffering for it.

Journalists have a responsibility to spread news as quickly as possible to educate the public on important events.
Alan Hung | Daily Trojan
Several news outlets, including CNN, the Associated Press, The Boston Globe and Fox News reported that a suspect was in custody last Wednesday before police captured Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and charged him on Monday.
Journalists should and usually are accurate, but timeliness is a vital part of news stories, both in order to be competitive and as a practical matter.
Of course, the value of a news agency is to give people good information in a timely manner. Judging the quality of information can be difficult, but most of the time, journalists at these organizations get it right. News organizations, after all, gain positive reputations only through accurate and relevant reporting.
But breaking the news, giving audiences information as quickly as possible, is what gives news value.
When law enforcement issues a press release, journalists can generally assume that the information is sound. At the same time, press releases during times of crisis often do not come out very quickly and often do not answer the most critical questions, especially compared to the unique information a reliable source can offer.
Journalists use their judgement to determine if sources in or familiar with organizations and investigations can give good information. And, if they get it wrong, they need to re-evaluate what happened.
It’s also important to spread information quickly in times of turmoil. People around the U.S. and world knew within minutes that a bombing had occurred in Boston and were able to contact people they care about to find out if they were safe. In 1815, the Battle of New Orleans was fought several weeks after the U.S. and England had signed a treaty ending the War of 1812. Of course, that was nearly 200 years ago and this would never happen today, but it shows that the quick spread of information is useful.
News organizations also work to quickly put out information in order to prevent the spreading of rumors. When bad information is put out, this utility is countered. But, this isn’t what happens most of the time.
And news organizations should compete with each other. Though news aims to be objective, one outlet by itself cannot be purely objective, and having multiple news outlets mitigates the bias of individual reporters or news organizations within society.
A society that only allows for news to come from official agencies will not be able to hold those agencies accountable when they mess up. The Los Angeles Times would never have found corruption in the city of Bell if they only reported on the government’s press releases.
Sure, history will not remember who broke the story first, but the people who are currently consuming news do.
Newspapers get money by breaking news and getting scoops on important issues. People turn on their TVs and read articles online to find out what is happening, and new information (or the reputation of getting new information) increases an audience, which increases the revenue news organizations get from advertisers.
Journalists should and must do their due diligence to report accurate information. At the same time, mistakes can happen in journalism just as they can happen anywhere else.
CNN’s John King, one of the reporters involved in the spread of inaccurate information, is aware of this. He told a local radio station, “I was involved in that. It’s not walking back, it’s correcting it. You have to do that, and it’s embarrassing.” He also said that, “In this case we had two reputable sources — one of mine, one of a colleague of mine — who have been reliable in the past, who simply had bad information. We had two — you never do that with one — and we went with it, and we had to correct it.”
Sometimes, facts are going to be wrong. News organizations must do everything in their power to prevent this, but sometimes reliable sources turn out to be not so reliable. What’s important is how these news organizations look at their errors and work to ensure they don’t happen again.

Beloved punk-chef and professional food snob Anthony Bourdain has revamped No Reservations for CNN this season as Parts Unknown, but I’ve got a few reservations.
This week’s episode (the second of the series) brought Tony to Los Angeles’ very own Koreatown. It began with a pithy overview of the LA Riots, during which Bourdain delivered an annoyingly elementary summation of the mood of Black Angelenos in 1992: “To say that people were angry would be an understatement.” Well, yeah, it would be. The offhanded nature of the comment would reflect the surprisingly shallow nature of the rest of the show.
African Americans are not heard from again in the hour-long program; their only presence is one of aggression to the Koreans who self-policed their neighborhood during the Riots. The message of the episode develops into one of selective multiculturalism: the melting pot portrayed seems to have quietly pushed certain groups farther East.
First we meet Ray Choi, owner of the Kogi truck and A-Frame in Venice. Choi is full of pride for K-town, and maintains that it has had a lasting impact on his life and business: “It’s kind of like I’ve got a huge Las Vegas hotel, but my hallways are the streets,” he remarks. But the cursory attempt later to tie Choi’s storyline and other Korean residents to nearby Mexican street culture didn’t convince me of a substantial or relevant alliance; the Latino street photographer profiled did concede that there are a few Korean lowriders, but he didn’t seem convinced himself.
Bourdain begins the show by highlighting a contrast between the ‘good Koreans,’ who want to be doctors or lawyers, and the bad boys who start restaurants and art studios. Bourdain unsurprisingly identifies with the bad boys, and his Pulp Fiction reference while eating an Aloha burger from the Jollibee (“that is a tasty burger”) is in character.
Yet I couldn’t help but question the ‘Bad’ premise of the episode when most of it is dedicated to a mogul (Choi) whose business model hinges on not being stuck in Koreatown. When Bourdain comments that Kogi’s food is affordable and “infinitely better than the King and the Clown and the Colonel,” does he understand that the truck most often leaves the neighborhood to find diners?
Later, he visits the Downtown studio of a graffiti artist who does murals for Facebook. When we are introduced to David Shoo, he is surrounded by young women dressed in bikinis, fawning over him, as he announces that he is “racist” against Korean women. The blatant glorification of offhanded sexism remains unqualified. It seems to be just part of the show’s exploitive paradigm: Bourdain gets a hip new portrait, and Shoo gets airtime, supporting the Bad image being sold.
Hopefully Bourdain’s move to CNN won’t portend a total jumping of the shark (I’ve always loved him!). In this episode, though, he was like an overwritten character, a corporatized punk playing an exaggerated, formulaic version of himself, palling around with other wealthy bad boys to boost the news network’s sagging ratings.
When Bourdain announces to a room full of locals that he’s just “a white boy from the suburbs,” the premise of Parts Unknown becomes as clear as its title is vague: as they say in the fashion world, blatant is the new black.
This is really unfortunate to hear I just moved to the area and I gotta say you’re right in that Koreatown is hip even my real-estate agent sold me on apartments in koreatown because it was hip and the best kept secret. Too bad this guy is only interested in it now. I gotta say I did love the episode and was fully entertained.
Where did the notion that the Kogi trucks originated from Koreatown come from?
Wasn’t it the Filipino-American who came up with the concept of Kogi, and like the other poster said, they were pretty much absent from Koreatown before the area became a cool destination. 
If you listen to how Roy Choi talks about Koreatown (watch the show), it’s obvious he really doesn’t know the area, not even basic geography.  He just repeats cliched nutshells of facts. I’ve been following his Twitter feed, and before this show and the announcement that he was hired by some hotel in Koreatown, I never had the impression that he was from KTown or was interested much in Korean culture. Wasn’t his schtick was that he could barely speak Korean? 
I think it’s because non-Koreans see him as Korean, they just assume he knows Koreatown  and Korean stuff. Same goes for David Choe. I had never heard him as being from Koreatown before. Not sure if he’s one of those “Koreatown” ballers who actually went to Beverly Hills High and/or grew up in Orange County, while their parents had eked out a living in Central LA. 
Just wish non-Koreans would stop assuming that anyone with a Korean last name is automatically an expert and authority on Korean culture and the Korean-American experience. It’s pretty shallow and degrading.
I can’t speak to the other episodes of this CNN show… I think a lot of people tuned in to this one because hey, it’s about Koreatown. 
So disappointing though. Half the show isn’t even shot in Koreatown… There were quite a number of inaccuracies about what they did cover in Koreatown — both in terms of facts and overall impression. 
It really wasn’t a show about Koreatown… It was like two separate stories about two Americans who happen to be of Korean descent… and they had to figure out how to connect them and turn it into one show? So uh, why not Koreatown? ‘
Need more “depth” in a few three-minute segments? Let’s reference the RIOTS. Yeah, 1992 was the crucial turning-point in KoAm consciousness, but the cognizance of that seemed so fake in this show, especially the first part.  
Maybe Anthony Bourdain was friends with or wanted to hang out with these two interesting guys (and ride one of those cars in East LA as well)… and his staff just shoehorned everything into a story purportedly about… Koreatown. 
Apparently, a lot of people lapped it up. It’s Bourdain. Anything he does becomes popular because he’s already a celebrity. He could chew an obscure brand of Korean gum and it would sell out the next day. (He should’ve demanded payment from Sizzler and Jollibee — corporations with massive advertising budgets.)
Sad that the time devoted to Sizzler and Jollibee could’ve been spent on Koreatown-specific restaurants. Maybe it’s true that the weekend highlight of David Choe’s childhood was Sizzler…. For many Korean Americans, it wasn’t… we did go to to Korean restaurants after church. A lot of us still do that. 
We of the new generation (and even the old really who’ve come a long way) are open-minded enough to appreciate the ethnic diversity in the area, but there’s a lot of Korean Koreatown pride among Korean Americans. Didn’t see that sincerity and earnestness in this episode.
It’s sketch that Roy Choi took Anthony Bourdain to Jollibee for that SPAM sandwich… he’s a paid endorser of SPAM. 
There should’ve at least been some sort of disclosure… In case you guys didn’t get what I just typed… The “chef” Roy Choi is a PAID endorser of SPAM.
First, it’s Roy Choi not Ray Choi and it’s David Choe not David Shoo!  How can anyone take your article seriously when you can’t even get the names right. Second, the African-American angle has been done a million times in the media. In fact, it was the only angle shown in the media for the past 21 years. This is the first time that a major news channel like CNN has shown the Korean-American angle. Stop whining about one friggin show that finally shows what Koreans were going through at the time of the riots. It was an incredibly difficult time.
ROY Choi is a fraud. It’s almost like he lied throughout the entire show about his connection to Koreatown. 
And golly, if you only knew for how many years he tried to distance the Kogi trucks from Koreatown… One of his trucks had to be paid $800 to show up at a Koreatown CHARITY event, whereas all the other trucks that showed up for that event (all without a single connection to Korean culture or Koreatown) willingly and silently lost money in the spirit of holiday charity. 
The only reason his Kogi trucks have been showing up on Wilshire and the area more recently is because Koreatown has gotten “hip” and he was hired to do some upscale shit for a development on Wilshire & Normandie…. so all of a sudden he’s marketing himself as a Korean American who knows Koreatown. 
Guess where he went to high school. Do a chronology of where he’s lived his life.

The “Dunk City” era at USC will now have to begin with a new starting center.
On Wednesday, junior 7-footer Dewayne Dedmon announced that he is leaving USC to declare for the NBA draft.
“It’s just my time to chase my dream and go to the NBA,” Dedmon said in a statement released by USCTrojans.com. “I had a great time at USC and it was a good experience. I had some ups and downs and learned a lot and believe it is best for me to turn professional at this time.”

After struggling to score in the early part of the season, Dedmon had the best stretch of his career towards the beginning of USC’s conference slate, averaging 10.8 points, 8.4 rebounds and three blocks per game in a five-game stretch.
He scored a career-high 18 points against Washington on March 6 but was suspended indefinitely on March 12 following a reported Saturday night incident in downtown Spokane between USC players and local bar patrons. Spokane police are still investigating the case.
USC lost 69-66 to Utah in the opening round of the Pac-12 tournament two days after the suspensions were announced, with Dedmon and also-suspended senior center James Blasczyk not making the trip to the tournament. The Trojans finished the season with a 14-18 record.
Dedmon averaged 2.1 blocks per game in 2012-13, good for second in the Pac-12 and the sixth-best single season total in USC history, and finishes ninth in program history with 85 career blocks. He also led the Trojans with 1.1 steals per game.
Turning 24 in September, Dedmon is the oldest early entrant into the draft. Because of religious reasons, he did not play organized basketball until his senior year of high school in 2007-08 at Lancaster High in Lancaster, Calif.
He played in 2009-2010 for Antelope Valley and transferred to USC the next year. He was proclaimed a surefire first-round pick by then-head coach Kevin O’Neill in 2011 but struggled to develop an offensive game and also missed the last 11 games of the 2011-12 season after injuring his left knee.

We are only five days in, and already I am just about done with the NBA Playoffs. I’ll admit that I have never been the biggest NBA fan. But after such a wild year of sports characterized by so much unpredictability, professional basketball is a dull affair to me.
It may sound stupid, but here’s the reason why: The Miami Heat will win it all. I would be willing to stake my meager life savings on it. And if I can predict the winner of the NBA Title with ease, without having watched a single game from start to finish this season, I doubt the NBA is going to reach too many new fans.
Now I could be totally wrong and my prediction of the Heat winning it all could blow up in my face and make my argument totally moot, but I doubt Miami loses. Coming off a championship from last season, this is a team that won 27 consecutive games and put up the 10th-best regular season record of all time (66-16). They’re good. Not to mention they have by far the best player in the league (I dare you to tell me Kobe is better). The advantage they have over other teams with the trio of James, Wade and Bosh is almost unfair, and as a result, the Heat will not even be challenged until they face off with the Western Conference champion in the finals.
So why wouldn’t I want to watch the Heat demolish teams like the Milwaukee Bucks? What could be better than a 48-minute LeBron James highlight reel? The answer is exactly what we won’t be seeing: An exciting finish to the NBA playoffs. Don’t get me totally wrong. The Western Conference will be, and already has been, fun to watch. As a bandwagon Warriors fan, I’m breaking out my “We Believe” shirt in hopes of another first round upset. But when it’s all said and done, the playoffs will end with a disappointing NBA Finals and a second ring on LeBron’s finger.  
Last year, I could not pull myself away from the TV as Miami and Boston faced off in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals. It was anybody’s guess as to which team would come away with the win in that series, and it made for some great basketball. Now, I’d be surprised to see any team take the Heat beyond five games.
We’ve been conditioned to root for parity in sports. That’s why everyone hates the Yankees and rooted for Wichita State in the Final Four. And that’s why when Miami makes quick work of the Thunder, Spurs, Clippers or any other team unfortunate enough to face them in the finals, I won’t be watching.

The Los Angeles Times Festival of books this weekend was a cornucopia for young people interested in beginning a career in the publication of literature. During a conversation at the Salvatori Computer Science Center on Sunday afternoon, several dozens of festival-goers learned about the world of publishing as “The Technological Frontier.” Los Angeles Times contributor Tom Lutz moderated a discussion between publishers of new media endeavors including Brian Haberlin, whose work has been immortalized in the Smithsonian’s permanent art collection.
Anomaly, an inter-media graphic novel created by Haberlin, wowed the audience with its innovative use of technology to enhance a work of literature. Haberlin spent four years designing the 370-page long graphic novel as writer and lead artist, but it is the work’s technological features that distinguish Anomaly from anything comic book enthusiasts are used to. Haberlin’s team designed a mobile app to work in conjunction with the print edition of the graphic novel that, when one points his or her iPhone or iPad camera at the pages of the book, produces 3D images of different characters or creatures from the story to grow out of the pages and interact with the reader.
The entire graphic novel can also be read as a freestanding app (no print edition required), which provides benefits of its own. Readers may turn the pages at their own speed, taking the time to examine the artwork, or activate special “touchpoints” that bring up additional information about characters, planets, creatures, spaceships etc. from the storyline.
Anomoly proves that, though consumption of literature is certainly moving into a digital realm, readers and creators alike will thoroughly enjoy literature’s new online home. As technology changes, more companies will create even more intriguing forms of cross-platform media, and the demand for creative positions in this field will rise.
