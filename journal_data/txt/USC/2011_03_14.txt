YouTube has launched its Creator Institute in conjunction with the USC School of Cinematic Arts to provide an opportunity for digital artists to hone their craft.
USC, along with Columbia College Chicago, will be partnering with YouTube to offer a state-of-the-art curriculum in ‘new media’ technology with classes in cinematography, story arcing, social media tactics and monetization strategies — in short the skills needed by content creators to succeed in the digital market.
The summer program will consist of online and on-campus classes taught by some of the best video, TV and film professors in the industry.
Prior to the launch, YouTube acquired Next New Network, a web-only video production house. The acquisition is the latest in YouTube’s plan to produce and own original content; a plan they hope this will boost content-creator development and help diffuse new ideas.
The YouTube Creator Institute is YouTube Next’s first initiative helping to jump start this plan.
USC and CCC will be accepting applications until March 25. Each school will accept ten applicants for the summer program, which runs from May 25 to June 22. Winners will be selected after a two-week voting period for their video submissions from March 28 to April 8.

Some say any press is good, but there seems to be nothing but trash talk about Christina Aguilera these past few weeks.  Between her sloppy Grammy performance, detainment for suspicion of public intoxication, poor-selling album Bionic, divorce from marketer Jordan Bratman whom she was married to for five years and lyric-flub of the national anthem at the Super Bowl Aguilera has not been looking too “Beautiful” in the limelight.
Things may be looking up, however, given that Aguilera is set to be on the judging panel for The Voice, which is a Mark Burnett production and basically NBC’s version of American Idol.  Maybe there is a light in the dark for this megastar
Claude Kelly, a contributing songwriter for both Bionic and Burlesque, told Entertainment Weekly, “All the media attention she’s getting, I guarantee it’s going to inspire her to release music that shows the world that it’s not over.”
This wouldn’t be the first time a diva has defeat public expctations to prove her talent and worth as a megastar. Perhaps it’s time the media and public took a break from celebrity scrutiny and instead held out for Aguilera’s eventual successful return.

The  “Blue Steel” pose is back and more “ridiculously good looking” than ever.
“We’re  shooting the Zoolander  sequel  at the moment,” Ben Stiller said, confirming another fashionably hilarious movie  about clueless supermodels. “Derek’s going to be back bigger and better than  before —no catwalk is safe,” Channel24.com reported.
Zoolander (2001)  ended happily with Derek (Stiller), Hansel (Owen Wilson), and Matilda (Christine  Taylor) conquering the evil Mugatu’s (Will Ferrell) machinations to kill the  Prime Minister of Malaysia. Hopefully the sequel will provide dastardly fashion  plots with more “break-dance fighting” and “walk-offs.”
“It’s  ten years later and most of it is set in Europe.  [Derek’s and Hansel’s] lives  have changed and they’re not really relevant anymore.  It’s a new world for  them,” Stiller revealed to Empire  Magazine.

While  no actors are at this time attached, Justin Theroux (Tropic Thunder), who played  the Evil DJ in the last Zoolander, is confirmed to be director.
Although  there is no doubt that Wilson will return to his iconic supermodel role,  the villain is still up for grabs.
Stiller  told Empire “Will Ferrell (Mugatu) is written in the script and he’s expressed  interest in doing it,” but Jonah Hill is also in negotiations to play the  villain.
The  sequel will most likely be released in theaters in 2012 with a PG-13  rating.

To USC closer Chad Smith, it must have been something out of a dream.
The junior righty and Los Angeles native was jogging across the Dodger Stadium outfield grass on his way from the bullpen to the pitcher’s mound. He was taking the same route as Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax and Orel Hershiser.
“It was pretty special,” said Smith. “I get chills just thinking about it.”
There were two outs in the eighth inning, the bases were loaded and the Trojans were leading 2-0 over No. 13 UCLA when Smith was called in for the four-out save. He got UCLA first baseman Dean Espy swinging on a 2-2 count to end the eighth, and then tossed a perfect ninth to seal the Trojan’s (5-10) victory over the Bruins (8-6) on Sunday afternoon at Dodger Stadium.
USC senior starter Logan Odom scattered just four hits over seven and one-third scoreless innings, walking just two and striking out four. It was what’s come to be expected of Odom, who has a 1.66 ERA in his last three starts—all have come against ranked teams.
“Odom’s been great this whole year for us,” said USC interim coach Frank Cruz. “He has a ton of confidence right now and we have a ton of confidence in him.”
For the first time in their last eight games, the Trojans got on the board first. With two down in the third, junior catcher Kevin Roundtree was hit by a pitch for the second time in the game. After a walk, junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa came through with a bloop knock just over the head of the Bruin’s second baseman to bring in Roundtree.
Junior right fielder Alex Sherrod led off the USC fourth with a walk, and junior left fielder Garret Houts followed that with a hit-and-run single, advancing Sherrod to third. With one out, sophomore third baseman Adam Landecker knocked in Sherrod with a single through the right side that put runners at the corners once again with one out, but they were stranded.
It was the decisive eighth inning that had all the makings of a rivalry game. After Odom left the game to a rousing standing ovation with one on and one out, freshman lefty specialist Bobby Wheatley came in and struck out his hitter. But then two different USC pitchers plunked Bruin hitters with the first pitch they threw to load the bases. Out came coach Cruz for his fourth pitching change in as many hitters, and the UCLA crowd let him know exactly what they thought of his micromanaging.
“Oh I heard them all right,” Cruz said about the UCLA fans. “But it didn’t matter. I was doing what I thought we needed to do.”
Turns out, Cruz was right, as Smith came in and shut the door.
The win was USC’s second in its last 11 games, something that was not lost on the Trojans.
“This is the kind of thing that can set the tone for the rest of the season,” said junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa. “We showed today that we all still believe in each other and pull for each other and we don’t quit.”
And the fact that it was UCLA was not lost on anyone either. 11,680 fans came out to Chavez Ravine Sunday to see the rivalry, and the players felt it.
“I can’t explain how big it is,” Odom said. “It really lifts the team spirits.”
Said Smith, “There is no other team who you wanna beat more.”
The Trojans host Louisville in a two-game series Tuesday and Wednesday, beginning a 10-game homestand.

The No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team notched back-to-back wins against No. 15 UC San Diego and No. 7 UC Irvine this weekend.
The Trojans beat the UC San Diego Tritons in straight sets with scores of 25-23, 28-26, and 25-23. Although this victory was earned in a sweep, the victory was less-than-decisive.
“They beat us to 20 in all three sets,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “We managed to turn it on late in each set though.”
Senior opposite Murphy Troy led the charge with 11 kills earned at a .417 clip. Troy and freshman libero Henry Cassiday shared the match-high with seven digs.
“We weren’t very sharp in any way, shape or form,” Ferguson said. “They had some runs off our errors and stayed in long enough to make it interesting.”
UC San Diego senior setter Phil Bannan managed to serve USC out of system for the majority of the match.
Despite an uncharacteristically high number of errors from the Trojans, the Tritons managed to hit at only a .181 clip for the match, including .000 in the second set.
Senior middle blocker Calvin Ross was expected to be UCSD’s biggest threat, but was held to two kills earned at a -.167 rate.
“We forced him into quite a few errors,” Ferguson said. “That’s one of the few places where we executed.”
Saturday’s match was competitive from start to finish, finishing with scores of 25-22, 22-25, 25-17, 27-25.
The match featured a revamped UC Irvine team (12-10, 9-7). The Anteaters featured a new starting setter in senior Anthony Spittle, and senior outside hitter Jordan DuFault and sophomore libero Will Montgomery returned from injury.
“With DuFault, [junior opposite] Carson Clark, and [senior outside hitter] Corey Yoder, Irvine has the best group of pin-hitters in the country after us,” Ferguson said. “And with Spittle running their offense, they’re going to be very fast.”
However, DuFault left the match during the first set. Freshman libero Jeremy Dejno filled in with 12 kills.
Troy again led the charge with 16 kills. Junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli added 12 kills, five digs, and four blocks.
The Trojans hit .339 to UCI’s .240 for the match.
The Anteaters used 6’4” backup outside hitter Kevin Carroll at middle blocker for the match against senior middle blocker Austin Zahn and junior middle blocker Steven Shandrick, who measure in at 6’8” and 6’7” respectively.
“Carroll did a good job blocking, especially considering he’s spent only two weeks playing middle blocker,” said senior opposite Murphy Troy. “But, our two middles match up great against anyone in the country.”
UC Irvine was riddled with errors, committing 20 service errors to USC’s nine and 27 attacking errors to USC’s 12.
After splitting the first two sets, the Trojans got hot in the third, finishing with a .478 hitting percentage.
“We show up at the right times,” said senior setter Riley McKibbin. “It’s good to win one in four against them. We’ve got a huge rivalry.”
The Trojans’ advantage at middle blocker ended up paying huge dividends at the end of the match.
With the match tied at 25-25, senior middle blocker Austin Zahn had a huge kill to give the Trojans the edge in a deuce game.
With the Trojans up 26-25 in the fourth and final set, junior middle blocker Steven Shandrick showed up with a huge block to end the match.
“As a team, we channeled a lot of energy into the match,” Shandrick said. “Whenever games go that long, it’s great to get that last point. It was awesome. No other way to describe it.”
The fiery McKibbin ended the match with a leap onto the scorer’s table to ring in praise from the crowd.
“I’m just stoked to win,” McKibbin said. “Not only did we win a really close match, but now we’ve closed out the second 3rd of our season with only one loss.”
[…]  USC records weekend victories Duke Ho | The Daily Trojan This game story examines how USC was able to win two conference matches during the weekend, despite its struggles against UC San Diego. However, the story primarily makes the list because of its nice use of quotes, especially the direct quote from Trojans coach Bill Ferguson on how the team was not sharp against the Tritons. […]
