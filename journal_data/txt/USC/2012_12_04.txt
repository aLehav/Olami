On Monday, the American Society of Clinical Oncology on Monday named a USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center study among the top 17 major advances this year.
The research first appeared in the May 15 issue of Cancer Cell, a peer-reviewed journal, and looked into identifying specific genes that must be turned off for cancer cells to survive.
USC Norris Director Peter Jones, the study’s principal investigator, is known for his studies on cancer at the molecular level and the basic interactions of DNA’s role in cancer. Co-authors include Keck postdoctoral researchers Daniel De Carvalho, Shikhar Sharma, Jueng Soo You, Sheng-Fang Su, Phillippa Taberlay, Theresa Kelly, Xiaojing Yang and Gangning Liang.
“The goal of the research was to discover what makes a cancer cell a cancer cell,” Jones said.
Because cancer cells come from bodies made of healthy cells, researchers look at what changes to make them become cancerous.
Jones’ study looked at certain genes, which are segments of DNA, that prevent cancer cells from dying normally after they undergo a common biochemical process called DNA methylation. Cancer cells show abnormal DNA methylation, and the research suggests that the methylation process is linked to the production of tumors.
“The cancer cell is the automobile, and the driver is the significant gene,” Jones said. “There are countless passengers but only a few drivers. Our aim is to find the few significant drivers, the gene that changes the cancer cell.”
The “passengers” are the genes that are not related to making the cell cancerous. The “driver” genes are the focus of the research as they are suspected to be the genes that trigger normal cells to turn into cancer cells.
In the long run, this process could potentially lead to more targeted cancer treatments that would cause cancer cells to die more easily.
Jones said he was proud to have his study featured.
“It was an honor to be selected, as many advances have been made in [the Journal of Clinical Oncology],” Jones said. “Cancer Cell is the top journal, a high impact journal, so it was a real honor for the research to be recognized.”

USC students in POSC 323: “Civic Engagement and Leadership” are making a difference -— one penny at a time.
Beginning early this semester, students in political science professor Ann Crigler’s  class aimed to bring Penny Harvest, a program that encourages students to save pennies for community investment, to elementary schools throughout Los Angeles.
Penny Harvest, a program within the educational non-profit organization Common Cents, is the largest child philanthropy program in the United States. Since the program’s inception in 1991, children between the ages of four and 14 have been collecting pennies and turning them into grants for their communities — the sum of which now total approximately $8.1 million.
It was through the efforts of the students in POSC 323 that Penny Harvest was able to make its way to the West Coast. According to Vanessa Villanueva, a junior majoring in political science and a teaching assistant for the class, the goal for the class has been to replicate the successes that Penny Harvest has enjoyed on the East Coast.
“What we’re trying to do is make that same program in New York and bring it over here,” Villanueva said.
The students in the class split into four committees: funding, communication, partnership and evaluations. Each committee was in charge of various aspects of implementing the program into local schools ranging from fundraising to grant research.
Sacred Heart, a K-8 charter school in Los Angeles, was the first school at which the USC students were able to implement the program. Students from the class were able to visit the school and introduce the program to the children.
Olivia Diamond, a junior majoring in public relations, said bringing a program like Penny Harvest across the country to Los Angeles was an exciting experience.
“It was really unique to get to start a nonprofit in Los Angeles that already exists in New York but hasn’t yet been brought to the West Coast,” Diamond said. “They’ve done it in some other cities, but it’s cool to start it in such a big metropolitan area.”
The children taking part in the Penny Harvest program were given the task of collecting pennies from their local communities and then deciding where they would like to best allocate their funds. To Villanueva, Penny Harvest’s primary goal is to teach youth about community engagement and basic investment skills.
“What’s great about the Penny Harvest program is that it teaches kids that what they have to do is that they have to research the community around them to see which organizations they want to give the money they raise to,” Villanueva said. “They interview people from homeless shelters and that sort of thing to see who they want the money to go to.”
Vanessa Estrada, a senior majoring in communications, sees the primary goal of the class as to emphasizing the pivotal role that youth can play in civic engagement.
“The goal of Penny Harvest isn’t just raising money,” Estrada said. “What makes it different from any other fundraiser is that … it’s student run. The students decide and vote on where to give the money so we’re giving the students the tools to decide.”
One of the main challenges the class faced was implementing the program into schools within the Los Angeles Unified School District.
“There was supposed to be another charter school and some LAUSD schools,” Villanueva said. “But we probably won’t start until next semester because of bureaucracy concerning LAUSD. Right now, it’s just Sacred Heart.”
Though bypassing bureaucratic hurdles was a challenge for the pilot program, Diamond said it was not an impossible feat.
“It was hard at first because, for example, LAUSD made it difficult to get into the public schools fast enough for it to work this year,” Diamond said. “But we have got into a charter school and we started a mini Penny Harvest on the USC campus to kind of get the ball rolling this year.”
The group that participated in “Mini Harvest” -— where the group sought pennies from students in residence halls -— raised $362.33, with residents in Webb Tower raising the most funds.
One of the main takeaways of the project, according to Villanueva, is that youth can have an impact on their communities, regardless of their age.
“Not only does it teach the kids to be more aware of their community, but it also empowers them to help their community,” Villanueva said. “It teaches that kids are not a burden to society, but rather they are an asset to society and that’s the great thing about this program.”
Looking to the future, the class hopes to expand the program throughout Los Angeles and pass on what they’ve learned to civic engagement classes to follow.
“Hopefully we’re going to try to get the communities around the schools we are working in to know so that everyone sees how interesting and unique it is to get these kids so civically engaged at a young age,” Diamond said.
The group plans to expand the program to five schools next semester.

President C. L. Max Nikias announced Tuesday that Lloyd Silberstein will serve as vice president and executive director for USC Capital Construction and Facilities Management Services, effective Jan. 1, 2013.
Silberstein will help oversee construction projects, according to Nikias. During the next two decades, USC hopes to add 5.5 million square feet of space to the University Park and Health Sciences campuses.
“His responsibilities will include the construction of new teaching, research, living, and health care space, as well as major renovation projects for existing structures,” Nikias said in a statement. “His portfolio will also include managing all of USC’s building and infrastructure assets on both campuses, as well as all capital construction project managers.”
Silberstein will report to Senior Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Robert Abeles and will work with Nikias. Vice President for Capital Construction and Facilities Management Thomas S. Leary, Jr, who began working at USC on Jan. 10, 2011, will report directly to Silberstein, who will also supervise about 450 people. Silberstein’s position is new to the university.
Prior to working at USC, Silberstein served as Senior Vice President of Parsons Corporation.
With nearly three decades of experience leading several of the nation’s largest construction programs, Silberstein comes to USC with an extensive background in his field.
Though his career has included construction projects, such as performing arts venues and hotel developments worldwide, Silberstein, over the last 15 years, has turned his focus to educational facilities for university, college and K-12 institutions in California. Silberstein previously worked on the 20-year master plan for UCLA.
Silberstein earned his bachelor’s degree at the University of Florida, College of Architecture’s School of Building Construction and received a master‘s in business administration at the University of Houston. He is a licensed general contractor and sits on the boards of several organizations.
“We all look forward to [Silberstein’s] arrival in the new year, and to welcoming him, his wife Juliette, and their son Max to the Trojan Family,” Nikias said.

In its last meeting of the semester Tuesday, Undergraduate Student Government passed groundbreaking legislation with the hopes of further strengthening the voice of the student body.

The senators passed resolutions regarding student tuition and a conflict mineral-free policy and unanimously voted to instate a student-at-large representative for the Student Programming Fee Committee.
The student tuition resolution, presented by the Campus Affairs Committee within USG, stipulates that USG will appoint one student representative to attend all university administration and Board of Trustee meetings about tuition. The student representative’s commitment will last one year.
The representative will focus on helping students better understand the rates of their tuition, voice his or her opinion on how tuition is determined and foster the relationship between the student body and administration. The student representative would  also be required to report to the Senate.
There has never been a role for a student representative at these meetings before.
Logan Heley, a sophomore majoring in broadcast and digital journalism and history and assistant director of Campus Affairs, believes the resolution will be well received by the student body.
“I think students will be receptive anytime they can see where their money is being spent and allocated, and I think they will be happy to have that understanding,” Heley said. The conflict-free mineral resolution asks the USC administration to refrain from purchasing technology made of minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Human rights groups attribute an increase of violence and genocide in the Congo to the minerals’ extraction.
The resolution also implores the administration to consider the conflict mineral status of a company before purchasing from them and influence the current companies they conduct business with to use conflict-free products.
At the meeting, Nathan Berger, a senior majoring in computer science and business administration, was also appointed as the student-at-large representative on the Student Programming Fee Committee.
Berger will serve as an outsider that lends advice to the organization and has the ability to vote on programming fee allocation, according to USG President Mikey Geragos. The programming fee funds will be taken to the administration and will apply for the next three years.
In the coming semester, USG will continue working to implement a fall break for students. The fall break would take place after midterms in the sixth week of school, and occur on a Thursday and Friday, extending students’ weekend to four days. USG is also planning to install multiple Evive Stations, which would allow students to clean and sanitize reusable water bottles. The stations align with USG’s University Affairs committee goal for increasing sustainability on campus.
New weight machines will be added in the New-North residence hall gym during winter break, and USG is currently researching the addition of a second 24-hour cafe on the University Park Campus near Parkside.
The Senate will also focus on incorporating life skills courses into the curriculum as well as working with the administration to reform the general education program.
Geragos said he was pleased by the diverse legislation the Senate brought up this semester, and is hopeful for more success in their continuing initiatives.
“The Senate this year has taken a hold of representing and expressing the student opinion,” Geragos said, “which is a telling sign of an active and progressive senate. They’re really challenging what they’re hearing and they have the best interest of USG. It’s very encouraging to me.”

The USC women’s basketball team hopes to end its current three-game road stretch on a high note as it prepares for a bout against Fresno State on Wednesday.
Homecourt · Sophomore forward Alexyz Vaioletama has helped the Women of Troy win three home games. The team is 1-1 on the road, however. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy (3-3) split the first two games of the road trip, beating UC Santa Barbara (2-5) 62-51 last Tuesday and losing to San Diego State (4-2) 80-46 on Friday.
USC committed 13 turnovers and 14 fouls in both games, but those were the only common statistic across the games. The Women of Troy shot 32 percent from the field against San Diego State and 49 percent against UC Santa Barbara. They were also out-rebounded 48-29 by the Aztecs, in contrast to outrebounding the Gauchos 28-22. It was the first game this season that USC was out-rebounded by its opponent.
“It’s in the back of our mind every time we get on the floor or watch film,” junior forward Desiree Bradley said. “In every aspect we take that game to get better.”
Junior forward Cassie Harberts, USC’s leading scorer and rebounder, has averaged 16.0 points per game and 4.5 rebounds per game on the road trip, while sophomore guard Ariya Crook, USC’s second-leading scorer, is averaging 10 points per game on the road.
The Bulldogs (4-2) are led by guard Ki-Ki Moore, who is averaging 16.7 points and 6 rebounds per game, and Alex Sheedy, who is averaging 10.2 points and 6.2 rebounds per game. They are currently in the third game of a four-game home stretch, beating Washington State 82-59 on Friday and UT Arlington 70-45 on Sunday.
“We’re really still a work in progress,” USC associate head coach Daron Park said. “There’s a lot of areas that we need to continue to address and work on to get better. … We spent a lot of time watching film, talking about what kind of team we want to be and how we want to do things and what we wanted to commit to doing to form our identity.”
USC and Fresno State met last season, with the Women of Troy winning 65-57. Harberts scored 14 points in the 2011 contest.
USC then returns to the Galen Center on Saturday, Dec. 15 to take on Texas A&M (3-3) at 12p.m. . They will then compete in the Women of Troy Classic at the Galen Center against UC Davis on Dec. 21st at 5 p.m. and against Duke on Dec. 22 at noon.

This is the story of a college football team, one with supreme talent and supreme expectations. One that spent more than half the season ranked in the Associated Press top-15 poll, only to finish unranked. One that lost at least four of the last five games it played. One with elite talent at, among others, wide receiver, center, running back, safety and defensive line. And one whose head coach called the offensive plays.
This is the story of the 2007 Golden Bears.
That Cal team didn’t start out as preseason No. 1, but by week eight the Bears were 5-0 and ranked No. 2 in the nation. Many Pac-12 fans remember their fateful game against Oregon State, when No. 1 LSU had already fallen earlier in the day. A home win against the unranked Beavers was all that was standing between Cal and No. 1 ranking.
Instead the Bears trailed most of the game before mounting a furious comeback. Down three points and out of timeouts with 14 seconds left and the ball on the Beavers’ 12-yard line, the Bears elected to run one more play at the end zone, trying to win the game with a touchdown. Then-freshman quarterback Kevin Riley made the terrible decision to scramble with the ball, got tackled in bounds, and time expired before the Bears could attempt a game-tying field goal. Coach Jeff Tedford slammed his play-card to the ground, and the Bears’ season was never the same.
Note the fact that Tedford was in fact holding a play-card. Much like USC coach Lane Kiffin, Tedford called the offense’s plays. And the similarities between the teams don’t stop there.
The Bears’ star was wide receiver DeSean Jackson, a future first-round NFL draft pick, presumably like Marqise Lee. The defensive standout was Thomas DeCoud, a safety like the Trojans’ T.J. McDonald. Trojan center Khaled Holmes is expected to be a first round draft pick, as was Cal center Alex Mack. The Trojans have a pair of future NFL running backs in Curtis McNeal and Silas Redd, as did the Bears in Jahvid Best and Justin Forsett.
The Riley scramble proved to be the obvious downfall of the Bears’ season. Likewise, Kiffin traces the downfall of USC’s season to a single play as well: senior quarterback Matt Barkley missing a wide open junior wideout Robert Woods on a would-be 87-yard touchdown pass in Arizona. Had the duo connected, the Trojans would have had a 35-13 lead.
But  the most striking similarity remains the coaches involved.
Tedford was Kiffin’s coach at Fresno State, and then his first boss after Kiffin quit the team to become an assistant coach his senior year. Both are micromanagers to the extreme, and both are fond of calling their own plays on offense.
An offensive coordinator for nine years before becoming Cal’s head coach in 2002, Tedford continued to call plays as the head coach in Berkley. But then, after the 2007 season, he gave it up.
“I always tried to keep my finger on the pulse of everything, but it’s hard to do it all,” Tedford said at the time. “The main reason is so I can be more efficient with my head coaching duties. I can spend more time with a lot of things that weren’t possible as the play-caller and with being so involved with the offense.”
Sound familiar, Trojans?
Now before I go any further, I recognize that Tedford just got fired and that he is not currently the most flattering comparison. No, I do not think Kiffin should be fired like Tedford. But Kiffin would do well to hire him — or anyone — as his true offensive coordinator to call plays.
After that 2007 season, Tedford said he lost touch with his players and with the locker room. His actual playcalling didn’t come into question the way Kiffin’s has, but that’s not why I believe Kiffin should give up the playsheet anyways.
Kiffin lost touch with his locker room over the season. He, over the course of this season that wasn’t, became so engrossed with the Xs and Os and the gameplan that he lost his team. He forgot that he is coaching 20-year-old students with class and homework and group projects and the like. Asa motivator, he failed miserably.
The Trojans repeatedly emerged from the locker room — be it to start the game or at halftime — looking lethargic and disinterested on the field. They were outscored in the first and third quarters this season 172 to 142. Five times they were held scoreless in the third quarter, four times in the first. Of the 24 halves of football USC has played this year, the opponent has scored first in 12 of them — a fairly accurate reflection of the Trojans’ record.
Anyone who watched the Trojans this year could tell that there was a distinct lack of passion on the field, especially as the season became progressively more disappointing. The grumblings from students on campus are not about the playcalling, but rather about what they hear from their friends on the team: It isn’t fun to play for Lane Kiffin.
He doesn’t command the respect of his players. He doesn’t make them look forward to practice. He doesn’t make them care about Trojan football.
Tedford put down the playsheet for the good of his team. The Bears went 9-4 the next year and finished the season undefeated at home. They played with pride and with passion. Kiffin would be wise to follow on the path of his mentor.

Senior quarterback Matt Barkley was awarded the 2012 Wuerffel Trophy, All Sports Association, Inc. announced Tuesday.
High character · Senior quarterback Matt Barkley has thrown 36 touchdown passes in 2012. He also maintains a 3.21 grade point averaage. – Sean Roth | Daily Trojan
Barkley, a four-year starter and three-time team captain for the Trojans, has been a finalist for the award the last three seasons. The award is given to the player in college football who best combines scholarship, community service and play on the field. To be eligible, the player must consistently perform service, must be a starter and have at least a 3.0 grade point average.
Barkley leads the Pac-12 in touchdown passes with 36 and has the conference career record with 116 scoring tosses. He was a second team Academic All-Pac-12 last season and holds a 3.21 GPA. He spent last spring break in Haiti helping underprivileged families and took several teammates with him on the trip.
“As a quarterback in college football, you have such a huge platform that you can use to help people,” Barkley said in a statement. “I remember looking up to guys like Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart when they were at USC, so I know how much kids look up to this position.”
The trophy is named after Danny Wuerffel, who played quarterback at Florida and won the Heisman Trophy and national championship in 1996. He was well known for being a devout Christian and for doing community service himself.
“Not only is Matt a phenomenal quarterback, he’s also an exceptional person,” Wuerffel said in a statement. “From the things he has done off the field to the way that he’s given of himself completely, he deserves every honor that comes his way. I’m proud to welcome him and he will be a fine member of the Wuerffel Trophy family.”
Barkley will receive the award on Feb. 8, 2013 at the All-Sports Association banquet at the Emerald Coast Convention Center in Fort Walton Beach, Fla.

After dropping three straight games, the USC men’s basketball team will have a chance to get back on track and pick up a big road win against No. 18 New Mexico on Wednesday at 7 p.m.
Wise beyond his years · Senior forward Eric Wise is second on the team in scoring, averaging 10.4 points per game. The Trojans have lost four of their last five games since starting the season 3-1. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
The Trojans are coming off a disappointing 63-51 defeat against Nebraska that dropped their record to 3-4 on the season. USC allowed the Cornhuskers to knock down 64 percent of their 3-point attempts, a major reason why Nebraska was able to pull off the victory. Looking forward to New Mexico, USC coach Kevin O’Neill realizes the importance of preventing another such perimeter attack.
“Obviously, we can’t give up 11 out of 17 3-pointers,” O’Neill said. “We’re in a rough stretch, but if you add up the win-loss record of our opponents, we’re playing tough teams. On the road it’s always tough. We’ve got to find our way offensively and defensively. Until then, it’s going to be difficult.”
The Lobos are led by their backcourt, as junior guards Kendall Williams and Tony Snell are averaging a combined 27.2 points and eight assists per game. The Trojans are hoping to slow them down offensively.
“We have to make sure we don’t give them catches in open space,” O’Neill said. “And when they do make catches, we have to get in their face. We can’t give up easy baskets and 3-pointers.”
USC’s backcourt, meanwhile, continues to provide spotty shooting performances. Starting guards senior Jio Fontan and junior J.T. Terrell finished a combined 9-of-24 from the floor against Nebraska, with Terrell still managing to lead the team with 14 points.
“I can’t really speak for J.T., but I think that it’s definitely been a little bit of a challenge for him,” sophomore guard Byron Wesley said before the start of USC’s road trip. “At junior college he was the main player shooting almost every time, so just coming here, trying to become more of a system player is definitely going to make his game way better. I’m excited for what we have.”
New Mexico enters Wednesday’s matchup with an undefeated 8-0 record. The Lobos started the season off with an 86-81 victory over Davidson and later took down the Connecticut Huskies to win the Paradise Jam tournament in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Beating the undefeated Lobos would be tough enough on a neutral court, but at University Arena in New Mexico it’s an even larger challenge. When asked if the Trojans were ready for the road test, O’Neill was blunt.
“No. But it doesn’t matter if we’re ready, we’re going to have to be there,” O’Neill said. “It’s obviously a good environment, but no different than any place like Arizona or Washington that we’ll have to play at later.”
In a hostile environment, the Trojans will look to avoid a slow start like the one in a recent home game against No. 17 San Diego State. USC lost that matchup 66-60.
“We know we can’t come out flat when we go out there because it’ll make that challenge even tougher,” senior forward Eric Wise said. “So we just want to come out from the beginning.”
Despite the mounting losses, O’Neill’s group isn’t conceding anything yet, especially with a chance to impress onlookers with upcoming matchups against ranked teams.
“We [have] lots of challenges ahead of us,” O’Neill said. “We still have two top-25 teams we have to play this week. We’re going to have to tie things together on both ends of the court. We don’t like results we’ve had in the past few games, and we’re determined to turn it around.”

Film is an art form, but many often perceive it — first and foremost — as a leisure activity.
Just look at the disparities between the potential awards contenders. This year, some of the most likely awards contenders  span all of genres and audiences: Skyfall (action-adventure), Lincoln (biopic), Beasts of the Southern Wild (fantasy), Flight (character study), Argo (political-thriller), Django Unchained (spaghetti western, of all things) and Les Misérables (musical).
It is this diversity, precisely, that makes the current film market interesting; it allows filmmakers to experiment and appeal to the multifarious wants of the consumer.
There is no problem, then, with films having different goals, but there is an issue in that many audiences have an either-or mindset on what film should be. The divide: Film as entertainment versus film as art.
If we want to be informed and fulfilled moviegoers, though, this mindset needs to be changed.
After a hard day’s work, many filmgoers don’t want to be challenged — they want mindless entertainment. And that’s completely understandable.
There is a time and a place for certain films. I’ve been putting off seeing Lincoln, not because I don’t want to see it (this is Daniel Day-Lewis we’re talking about here), but because I have to be in the mood, in the right state of mind to see a 2 ½-hour biopic.
On the other hand, sometimes I’m in the mood films such as Michael Haneke’s Amour. The love story looks at an elderly couple at the end of their lives, telling a story of love slowly fading away into the grasps of death. The film practically screams depressing, but still the critics love it because it touches on something real.
Entertainment Weekly’s film critic Owen Gleiberman describes the film as, “Transfixing and extraordinarily touching, perhaps the most hauntingly honest movie about old age ever made,” and that’s an endorsement if I ever heard one. And yet many moviegoers will probably skip over this film because it isn’t the typical “enjoyable” or “entertaining” piece of cinema. Moviegoers as a whole have this idea that entertainment generally consists of cars blowing up, people falling in love (and it working out), crude humor, etc. But who’s to say that entertainment has to be restricted to such defined terms?
Audiences need to re-conceptualize rigid definitions of entertainment and extend that definition to include what engages them.
For me, a big part of what makes a film great is whether or not it carries the capacity to make a viewer really feel or think about something and become invested in the story.
Bridesmaids made me laugh like no other comedy last year, Tree of Life made me think about the meaning of our existence, Looper kept me on edge and excited and Silver Linings Playbook made me feel a little bit of everything.
The point is, all these films made me feel something. They are all works of art — and some proved incredibly entertaining as well — but more importantly, they have the capacity to instill emotion into the viewer and that’s what really matters.
Film can be artistic and entertaining, but we can’t ignore art just because it isn’t necessarily “leisurely” per se. If anything all film is art, but all art isn’t necessarily entertaining. We just have to learn to pay more attention to films that might not excite us in the way Skyfall did. We also must look to films like Amour that create something real with feelings.
As awards season continues to heat up, keep in mind film is not necessarily just about leisure. Maybe a film doesn’t keep us entertained in the typical sense of the word, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth seeing.
Ultimately, film viewing should be inclusive, and if we want to be informed viewers who are exposed to well-made, emotionally stimulating works, we need to be open to all films, both artistic and entertaining.

The new Stanley Kubrick exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art flaunts original costumes and props, intricate set dioramas, furniture pieces, original scores, lined scripts, set photographs and several modern art pieces that inspired the director’s distinct vision during his 50-year career. The museum’s curators have added an element of artistry to the pieces by aggregating these artifacts and displaying them as individual artworks in their own right.
The theme of the show revitalizes the classic debate surrounding auteur theory: Can Kubrick’s name be stamped on all these various aspects of production? And can film artifacts like a letter from the Christian Authority calling for Kubrick to stop production on Lolita be displayed as art?
LACMA’s curators would argue yes.
If, as Kubrick asserts, the director’s role is that of an “idea and taste machine,” then the fact that Kubrick’s own hands did not form all the works in the gallery should not undermine his own artistry. His films’ ability to maintain a recognizable style despite heavy collaboration must then be lauded; he is the type of artist that must be acknowledged by contemporary art museums — and not just because it’s in fashion.
When walking into the intelligentsia-serving museum coffee shop, hearing the Rolling Stones’ “Start Me Up” and seeing baristas in newsboy hats and bowties, it becomes clear that this season of LACMA will ooze hipness. The inclusion of long-censured photographer Robert Mapplethorpe’s work adds to this effect, but it also makes it clear that modern art museums today enjoy a freedom they were once denied.
Kubrick faced his own bout of societal pressures and government censorship on films like Lolita (1962) and A Clockwork Orange (1971), respectively. Kubrick went through the ringer after Clockwork — originally an Anthony Burgess novel years before Kubrick brought the characters to life — because several British boys committed crimes while dressed as the film’s fictional hooligans, the “Droogs.” Kubrick’s work, like his retrospective, had raised questions about the boundaries and responsibilities of art.
Many attempted to draw a line of artistic value and historicism between visual art and cinema in the early 1930s. Had MoMA failed to include film programming, a 16-year-old Stanley Kubrick taking photographs for Look magazine (which are displayed at LACMA) might not have developed into the filmmaker we admire today.
This interplay between visual art and film remains foundational for processing Kubrick’s work. Though the exhibition includes an opening video of noteworthy scenes from Kubrick’s films to acclimate museum-goers, a trip into the Ahmanson building to see the German Expressionism exhibition or to the permanent contemporary pop art gallery will better prepare novices and film buffs alike for the extensive Kubrick exhibition by providing a more in-depth explanation of Kubrick’s style.
Kubrick’s central questions of morality and themes of irrationality, insanity, violence and fear of institutional oppression can be traced to the German expressionists; Kubrick’s choice genres — noir, science fiction and horror — also sprung from the movement. Expressionism’s visual influences can be seen at LACMA in Kubrick’s expressive use of the color red a la Ernst Kirchner and the Commedia dell’Arte masks and other tropes in Eyes Wide Shut (1999).
Understanding the movement from pop-art gallery wall to silver screen is also imperative for a comprehensive understanding of Kubrick’s work. An obvious example is the monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), rumored to appropriated from the works of John McCracken, one of which appears in the exhibition and another in the permanent collection. The gallery illuminates Kubrick’s sensibility of criticism toward popular culture, his style felt immediately in the irrationality of a Jackson Pollock drip painting (c. 1956) or pop of color and focus on form in Claus Oldenburg’s “Giant Pool Balls” (1967).
The exhibition on its own, though, serves as a fascinating romp through the life and work of this brilliant, visceral, detail-obsessed twenty-first century artist. It is completely immersive: The curators put you right in the middle of the Korova Milk Bar of Clockwork and the War Room of Dr. Strangelove (1964). There is a small room dedicated to soundtrack listening, and the helmet from 2001 comes to life with a tiny projector displaying the face of the astronaut.
Art necessitates a constant cycle of inspiration, borrowing and even outright theft. The exhibition, therefore, is a sophisticated, contemporary conception of the artist as a visionary vessel, rather than a craftsman. Does this mark the death of Kubrick or his postmodern rebirthing?
This is the challenging question surrounding cinema; it is a collaborative sport, and the rules constantly change. Kubrick never produced his own original material because he felt that reading a piece for the first time allowed him to “fall in love” with it. We might borrow from Kubrick as we walk the halls of LACMA this season, throwing away previous ideas of what constitutes art and whom we might label an artist. Instead, we might take the time to step back and allow ourselves to fall in love with cinema all over again.
 
“Stanley Kubrick” runs through June 30 at LACMA, which is located at  5905 Wilshire Blvd.

Margaret Simon is entering sixth grade. She just moved to New Jersey with her family. She comes from a mixed-faith family and she struggles to understand her religion, herself and the changes brought on by puberty. Does this sound familiar? It’s the start of Judy Blume’s classic coming of age tale set in the 1970s, Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret, a serious story about a serious subject in a young girl’s life. But imagine if the story wasn’t so serious.
Mamma mia · Drew Dreoge stars as Mom in Are You There God? It’s Me, Karen Carpenter, a new play that parodies Judy Blume novels. – | Photo courtesy of Dane Whitlock
Are You There God? It’s Me, Karen Carpenter pokes fun at the themes of growing up in Blume’s novel. It keeps the storyline mostly intact, but reinvents it by casting Margaret’s mother in drag, dressing the characters in over-the-top outfits from the ’70s and using songs by Carpenters to illustrate the universal cliches the characters go through — everything from the joy of a first crush to the embarrassment of going shopping for a training bra.
Written and directed by Dane Whitlock, the musical takes the audience back to the years of pimples, awkward first crushes and that overpowering desire to fit in.
What Margaret (Carey Peters)  wants more than anything in the story is to be normal, but the people in the world around her are anything but. Though it’s a comical play, Whitlock might be playing with that theme to ask, what is so great about being normal anyway?
The story focuses on the small things that at age 11 seemed so important. Watching an adult cast of characters act out those problems, knowing they themselves made it through their teenage years intact, makes the situations funny — especially since the characters’ problems are voiced to soft rock ballads like “Rainy Days and Mondays” by Carpenters, which one would imagine was not originally written with periods or preteen boy problems in mind.
Margaret begins the story as the new girl in town. She quickly meets her new partners-in-crime Nancy, Gretchen and Janie. Together they create a secret club and come up with the name the Preteen Sensations. As Margaret frets about fitting in with the group, she falls hard for Nancy’s brother’s friend, Moose Freed. But because Nancy says Moose is “gross,” Margaret doesn’t want to announce her feelings in fear she will be rejected by Nancy and the  rest of the group.
According to Nancy, a more acceptable boy to date is Phillip Leroy. So, when at a Hannukah party Leroy picks Margaret’s name during a game of “Two Minutes In The Closet,” Margaret goes with him and gets her first kiss. Moose finds out about the party, though, and distances himself from her. Margaret is devastated. Soon afterward, Nancy gets her period and Margaret is left feeling even more alone and rejected.
The musical itself is over the top, but in a good way. The slapstick builds throughout the performance and by the time Margaret gets her period at the end of the musical, it is not surprising to see puppets with maxi-pads singing or a sheer red cloth waving in the air to celebrate the milestone.
One of the most unique ideas of the adaptation was using Drew Droege — of the popular online Chloë Sevigny parodies — to play various female roles throughout the performance. Each outfit and stereotype he plays is more outrageous and unexpected than the next and his cameos keep the audience on its toes wondering what role and what outfit he will come out in next.
At first, perhaps because of its over-the-top nature, the musical feels a little overwhelming. The characters have big personalities and the Hudson Mainstage Theatre seems at times too small of a venue to fit the gaggle of preteen girls jumping up and down, gossiping about boys and bras. But as soon as the story hits its pace, it is easy to fall back into the silly tale.
At its core, the story is slapstick with heart. Oddly enough, even though the musical focuses on parodying the middle school experience, the audience is still able to empathize with the characters and their experiences because they’ve been there. The play’s relatability becomes its greatest asset because it allows the audience to connect with the humor but also with the characters.
Middle school is not a period of time that many would like to relive. For girls, the era recalls training bras, hormones and acne. But looking back, that period in life can be comedic gold. Are You There God? It’s Me, Karen Carpenter embraces the quirks along the road to adulthood. The mash-up with Carpenters, including a special guest appearance by Karen Carpenter to offer Margaret advice, gives the musical its own voice and ’70s vibe. It might not be the musical that young girls turn to for advice on growing older, but it is the musical for people wanting to look back on their experiences and get a chuckle about what they were preoccupied with as a teenager.

According to USC Thornton School of Music alumna Shani Shousterman, inspiration for a song can come from anywhere, even from a random conversation overheard at Starbucks.

This unique outlook on songwriting has led Shousterman to write one-of-a-kind songs that will be featured in her album titled Merry Go Round, which will debut on Dec. 23 in a performance on the main stage at Universal CityWalk. On this night, Shousterman will perform on a stage formerly graced by many well-known acts, including Cee-lo Green, Carly Rae Jepsen and Colbie Caillat.
“The CD release is going to be on the big stage, which I’m very excited about because that’s going to be an awesome show,” Shousterman said. “I can’t wait.”
Merry Go Round, Shousterman’s first studio album, was funded through a combination of Kickstarter.com and donations from fans that Shousterman has gained as a result of being a street performer on the walkways of Universal CityWalk.
“I have this permanent residency at CityWalk to perform and be part of the entertainment as people walk by,” Shousterman said. “I auditioned for that opportunity and got accepted about half a year ago. I play there about once or twice a week. It’s been an amazing opportunity that has opened a lot of doors for me, just to get my music to people who wouldn’t otherwise hear it.”
Shousterman started out as a pianist when she was seven years old, focusing on classical music at an early age. When she got to high school, however, she played jazz, and during her senior year, she took a choir class, which was her first formal vocal experience.
“At the end of high school, we had senior solos where all the seniors could do any sort of musical performance they wanted,” Shousterman said.  “And I decided to write a song and that launched me into the passion that I have now, which is as a singer-songwriter.”
Shousterman entered USC as a jazz piano performance major in 2006, but after the first year, she took songwriting and vocal training so she could mold her own major into what she wanted it to be. It was during this time that she took a class with Chris Sampson, USC’s popular music associate dean and Shousterman’s songwriting mentor and teacher.
“I had this burning desire to be a songwriter and took Chris’ class and knew that without a doubt I wanted to pursue that path,” Shousterman said. “Chris has been there for me for all four years of college and beyond.”
Sampson first met Shani when she was a student in his songwriting class at Thornton. At the time, she was a jazz piano major who had enrolled in his songwriting class as an elective.
“After that, Shani fell in love with songwriting and changed her major to a BA in music, which allowed her to register for all my songwriting courses and study with me through private lessons,” Sampson said. “She was one of the most dedicated students I’ve ever had.”
According to Sampson, Shani never arrived to a lesson unprepared. She was incredibly busy during her time at USC, but every week she would come in with a new song for them to work on.
“Shani was always open to direction. She definitely had her own ideas about how she wanted her songs to sound, but she was always genuinely wanted to make them better,” Sampson said. “This made for a great teaching dynamic with her, as there was lots of back and forth between the two of us, always with the goal of making her songs the best possible.”
Now, Shousterman gets inspiration for the songs she writes from a variety of sources, including strangers and friends.
“Sometimes I will get an idea about the topic of a song through living life like from a conversation that random people are having at Starbucks,” Shousterman said. “My friends will have something that happens in their life, or I’ll have something happen in my life … and I’ll jot down little notes and that will develop into something. And sometimes I’ll come up with the music first, so it depends on my mood or on what’s inspiring me.”
Sampson describes her lyrics as “truly beautiful.”
“She has a knack for finding a unique insight into our world and getting to the emotion of it with her writing,” he said. “Then, she has outstanding musicianship to be able to set the lyrics in a way that enhance their meaning.”
In addition to working with Sampson, Shousterman also has close relations with Tim Kobza, a USC guitar professor and the producer of her album.
“I met Shani in a class that I was teaching at USC,” Kobza said. “She actually took guitar lessons from me and then she took a course that was more of like a songwriting production class. She’s a really hard worker, and she’s a talented artist and singer-songwriter. Working with her was always great. She’s easy to work with because she’s good at what she does and so she takes direction well and she’s constantly trying to better her work.”
Merry Go Round began as a collection of songs starting at the beginning of Shousterman’s songwriting career and it’s a progression from then until now. It has taken about two years to create this album, which features eight songs and a full band.
“Producing her album was an interesting process because a singer-songwriter will come and sing songs to you and then from there you’re kind of in a collaborative process,” Kobza said. “It becomes a collaboration between two people to try to bring the most out of the songs sort of along the lines of the vision the artist has and that’s the challenge of being a producer is to try to find a way to get the vision across successfully.”
In the producing industry, the end result takes prime focus. Through an intricate process of examining an artist’s songs, Kobza and other producers  work to improve or clean up tracks so that they are ready to be a marketable product in the form of a recorded song.
“We would just get together and she would bring the raw ideas and we would hone them into a place where they were ready to be recorded,” Kobza said. “That’s the early process. Then later in the process it’s about getting a good band performance and getting a great performance from her as well and to make sure her songs are represented in that way.”
Grammy Award-winning mixer Tremaine Williams immediately clicked with Shousterman because they shared a similar taste in music and he decided to mix the album Merry Go Round.
“Shani plays, sings and writes. There just aren’t a ton of artist who can do all three and be good at it,” Williams said. “As the mixing engineer I probably listen to the songs more than anyone else. The cool thing about Shani’s material is that I genuinely enjoy it and even though the project is done, I still listen to the songs. That says a lot.”
In addition to writing her own album that began at USC, Shousterman contributed to the university by creating an a capella group on campus and playing the saxophone in the Trojan Marching Band.
“There’s no other marching band as cool as the USC marching band. Besides wearing awesome helmets with feathers and a cape, which is super cool, I got to get involved in the sports life and I got to learn a new instrument,” Shousterman said. “It was a one of a kind experience that I am so happy I took advantage of. It was a sense of community. I felt like I was part of something.”
Shousterman thoroughly enjoyed her undergraduate and graduate time at USC and advises students to meet lots of people, to network, and to create relationships.
“This industry is based on relationships. Listen to your teachers and people who are in the industry because they have some pretty valuable information,” Shousterman said. “You never know what your classmate is going to end up doing, so keep connected with the people you are studying with. The best thing you can have in this industry is a community filled with people that you trust and know.”

Last week the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released new recommendations stating its support for over-the-counter oral contraceptives. Currently, birth control is only accessible per a doctor’s prescription. By making the drug available over the counter, patients would have definite benefits — potentially lowering the price of birth control, increasing access for women and saving health insurance companies money — but at what cost?
The biggest danger that would come with birth control becoming an over-the-counter drug is the loss of a very crucial role that doctors play in prescriptions. If it’s available over the counter, women will no longer be required to see a doctor before beginning the pill: They will not be screened by a doctor for risks prior to use of birth control, they will not be able to determine whether they are experiencing detrimental side effects after going on the pill and they will have no way of deciding which type of birth control is suited for them in conjunction with other prescription medications they might be taking or other health issues. Because of this, birth control should remain a drug that is solely prescribed by doctors after consultation.
There are numerous examples of the negative health impacts of over-the-counter availability. One is birth control’s interaction with a common antibiotic, rifampin. If a woman is taking rifampin and birth control at the same time, the contraceptive loses its ability to prevent pregnancies, and it is recommended by doctors to use a second type of birth control when prescribed rifampin. According to Women’s Health Magazine, birth control also puts women slightly more at risk for blood clots, especially those who already exhibit cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, or those who smoke.
A proponent might suggest including extra warning labels, which raises another issue: If birth control becomes an over-the-counter drug, are the drug’s warning labels enough of a precaution if the side effects are too serious?
The warnings that accompany any given birth control are endless, and as such over-the-counter birth control would require multiple warning labels that most women would not likely read. Even a warning provided in a supplemental small booklet might not be sufficient enough to warn someone that birth control will not be effective for them. There is no replacement for a doctor explaining to a woman in person not only the general known side effects of a drug, but how it will affect her specifically.
But one of the main side effects of birth control, mood swings, is one that can affect any person regardless of health conditions or habits, and a warning label would not suffice to address this.
In a 2008 Health.com article on common birth control side effects, Dr. Hilda Hutcherson, an ob-gyn professor at Columbia University explained the complexities of dealing with this.
“If it’s really the birth control and not some other factor that’s bringing you down, you may need to find a nonhormonal method,” she said.
How would a woman know that her depression is a result of her birth control without consulting a doctor, and then know what different kind of birth control to change to? A drug with a possible side effect as serious as depression renders a consultation with a doctor necessary.
Another pro-over-the-counter argument relates to money. The monetary advantages of making birth control more accessible are minimal, to such an extent that they do not justify the health risks. Under Obama’s Affordable Care Act, birth control is covered by insurance as a prescription medicine only. In 2010, 16.3 percent of Americans were uninsured according to CNN, meaning drug companies would be making a decision that would be cost beneficial to every one in nine people.
Though making birth control accessible over the counter would relinquish doctor fees and make it more affordable for those that cannot currently afford contraceptives, the health risks outweigh the cost benefits.
As Iowa State Daily reporter Leah Hansen wrote Monday, “It would be up to the women to know which brand and dose she needs, what are the side effects, what other medications may interfere with birth control and any other questions she might have regarding the product.”
Doctors are part of the birth control process for a reason: to warn patients of potential side effects, to monitor their health while on medications and to serve as a personal resource for a potentially risky drug. There is no substitution for that.

So then libertyMinded, should all drugs should be over the counter? I can appreciate your principle but not the judgement by which you blindly apply it.
Many OTC medicines have many health risks. For one, aspirin and acetaminaphone (tylenol) have a lot. Asprin is known to cause stomach ulcers and is dangerous to people who already have ulcers. Acetaminaphone can cause liver damage and is dangerous when taken with alcohol. To say women will not be smart with thier health or look into the possible side effects is infantilizing. Many countries have allowed
BC to go OTC.
Life is full of risks. Free societies allow adults to evaluate risks and make choices. Free societies allow adults to choose their advisers. In the end doctors are people subject to all the infirmities of every human being. Using the power of the state to enforce a monopoly on birth control is no different than the Puritans restricting freedom of the Quakers to worship as they please.

When we agreed to attend university in Los Angeles, a smoggy skyline was the catch to palm trees, beaches and year-round good weather. But air pollution remains much more than an ugly stain on the Southern California aesthetic — and more, even, than an environmental issue.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
Research conducted by USC and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles scientists released this week -— indicating a correlation between autism and exposure to air pollution during pregnancy — demonstrates how dirty air is not just an eyesore, but a veritable public health risk. In light of these findings, USC students should do all they can to reduce pollution in Los Angeles, in the interest of our personal and community health.
The need for urgent action on air pollution stems from general uncertainty about just how dangerous pollution could be for our bodies. The USC-CHLA study is just one example of how the health impact of pollution is more expansive than scientists once thought.
“We’ve known for a long time that air pollution is bad for our lungs and especially for children,” Heather Volk, assistant professor of preventive medicine at the USC Keck School of Medicine and the principal investigator of the study, told USC News on Nov. 27. “We’re now beginning to understand how air pollution may affect the brain.”
Autism might only be one of many serious medical conditions caused by air pollutants, conditions that could potentially affect us at all stages of life — not just during fetal development. Public health issues, meanwhile, affect everyone within a community, regardless of whether or not one actually gets sick. Illness and injury impede education and economic activity, lower community morale and increase local and national expenditures on health care.
When the stakes are this high, we can no longer act as if pollution does not affect us or the community in which we live. Instead, we must take steps to curb this effect.
At USC, this means, foremost, reducing our dependence on motor vehicles. USC News reported the USC-CHLA study found that “exposure to traffic-related air pollution during pregnancy and the first year of life is associated with a more than two-fold risk of autism.”
Also, in Los Angeles, one of the best ways to reduce such pollution is to bike more. In 2010, the California Air Resources Board estimated that for every one percent of car and light truck trips replaced by bicycle trips, there would be a 0.65 ton reduction in inhalable pollutant particles per day, statewide. The study specifically linked these same inhalable particles to increased risk of autism, even if the mother did not live near a busy road.
If each of USC’s 38,000 students, who comprise roughly one percent of Los Angeles’ population, pledged to replace car trips under five miles with biking, the city would see a significant decrease in inhalable particles and other air pollutants. As college students in Los Angeles, we are poised to make this change: Plenty of Trojans already own bikes, and an abundance of bike racks, bike lanes and good weather make the city ideal for bicyclists.
Public transportation offers another alternative to driving, particularly for longer trips. USC is a public transit hub in its own right, offering a free shuttle to the Health Sciences Campus and Union Station and within walking distance of the Expo Line, the F-Dash and more than 10 bus routes. The university also hosts a private Zimride Rideshare Community, making it easy for students to arrange carpools.
And we can not only change the way we travel, but the way we live at home. It is easy to disregard the consequences of leaving a light on, especially for those students whose utilities are paid for, but pollution is an inevitable byproduct of most forms of energy production.
Autism might just be the tip of the iceberg of pollution-related brain disorders and other health problems. To prevent what else might be lurking underneath the surface, students should make every effort to reduce their contributions to air pollution, benefiting ourselves and our community.

You can do more for the environment  by skipping meat one day a week that you can by reducing 1000 miles of driving in your car.
The World Health Organization attributes a full 18% of GGE to the consumption of meat and only 13% to all transportation methods combined.  As long as we insist on eating a Standard American Diet based on meat and animal protein, our GGE will continue to rise as will worldwide hunger.  By eating the grain and drinking the water we give to animals use in large scale food production, we could feed the plant.
