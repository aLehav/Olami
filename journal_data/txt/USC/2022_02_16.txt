United States District Court Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton sentenced John Wilson, private equity financier, to 15 months in prison and two years of supervised release Wednesday for his involvement in the Operation Varsity Blues scandal, according to a Department of Justice press release the same day.
Wilson’s sentence is now the stiffest of all participants in the scandal, exceeding Gamal Abdelaziz’s one year and one day sentence in prison announced Feb. 9. 
Wilson was also sentenced to 400 hours of community service, a $200,000 fine and ordered to pay $88,546 to the IRS.
A federal jury convicted Wilson Oct. 8 on one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, honest services mail and wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery, three counts of wire fraud and honest services wire fraud, two counts of federal programs bribery and one count of filing a false tax return.
“What they did was an affront to hardworking students and parents, but the verdict today proves that even these defendants — powerful and privileged people — are not above the law,” said acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Nathaniel Mendell in a press conference following Wilson’s conviction. 
In 2013, Wilson hired William “Rick” Singer — the organizer of the scheme who modified test scores and fraudulently admitted students to elite schools as varsity athletes — to fabricate an athletic profile for his son and facilitate his acceptance into USC, according to a Department of Justice October press release. 
Wilson paid Singer $220,000 to admit his son as a purported water polo recruit, the press release read. The payment came after his son’s acceptance to USC as a $100,000 contribution to Singer’s fake charity, the Key Worldwide Foundation, a payment of $100,000 to Singer’s company, The Key, and $20,000 paid directly to Singer.
Wilson also agreed to pay Singer $1.5 million in 2018 to facilitate his twin daughters’ acceptances to Harvard University and Stanford University as athletic recruits, according to a Feb. 16 Department of Justice press release. Wilson paid the bribes from the corporate account of his private investment firm, which he then falsely deducted as business expenses and charitable contributions. 
Singer pleaded guilty March 12, 2019 and awaits sentencing.
Wilson’s sentence, although the longest of all those given to other participants, is shorter than the maximum sentences for his convicted charges. Mail and wire fraud is punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater. Federal programs bribery provides for a sentence of up to five years’ imprisonment, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater.
USC declined to comment on Wilson’s sentencing. Wilson’s lawyer Michael Kendall did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Undergraduate Student Government senate debated on senator Hunter Hinson’s Suit Up funding proposal Tuesday. The vote passed unanimously. 
The program, intended to assist low-income students, obtains professional attire for occasions such as scholarship, internship and club interviews. USG will distribute $7,500 in funding to the USC Career Center, which will purchase JCPenney gift cards to distribute to students. 
When running for a senate position last year, Hinson campaigned on the plan of providing business attire for low income students who need it for interviews and other occasions. Although similar programs existed in years prior, Hinson said Suit Up will give students more flexibility in obtaining professional attire. 
“In the past, it’s been an in-person only event where they send USC students to JCPenney on buses,” Hinson said. “Now, we’re having a hybrid approach where you can go in-person or you can shop online.”
Hinson said the motivating factor for the program’s establishment was the financial barrier that limits some students’ ability to purchase professional attire. 
“A lot of clubs on campus, internships and scholarship interviews require business attire to be worn,” Hinson said. “Obviously, business attire is something that’s incredibly expensive.”
Speaker of the senate Tommy Nguyen said he’s glad the proposal passed and USG will work with the Career Center to promote the initiative. 
“As we’re transitioning in-person, [professional attire] is, unfortunately, gonna be a big expectation for a lot of these interviews and networking events,” Nguyen said. “That’s a huge accessibility issue …. USG will be sharing lots of graphics, QR codes and information. It’s gonna be out there.”
During the meeting, senator Nivea Krishnan spoke about establishing a meal swipe donation system. While such a program existed at USC before the coronavirus pandemic, it has yet to come back since the return to in-person campus life. 
According to Krishnan, the defunct Swipe Out Hunger USC program set up tables outside dining halls near semesters’ ends and had students with leftover meal swipes donate to students in need. Krishnan said the program adjusted weekly to accommodate freshman meal swipes resetting each Sunday. 
“I’m trying to get [University administration] to do it at the end of every week so that we can accumulate those meal swipes and distribute them more frequently to students,” Krishnan said. “[University administration was] completely on board with that.”
Krishnan said the program would operate similarly to the old system, but this time, USG plans to work with an existing student organization that worked on meal donation last semester and which hopes to work quickly on the project. After meeting with representatives from USC Dining and Student Basic Needs Tuesday morning, Krishnan said she’ll be drafting a proposal for Thursday.
At the end of the meeting, representatives from two student organizations spoke: the Middle Eastern and North Africa Student Association and the Military Associated Student Assembly hoping to become student assemblies. Speaker Nguyen spoke optimistically of their potential establishment and said the assemblies are “very important” and “led by two very amazing people.”

At the USC Fisher Museum of Art’s latest exhibition, you’ll be able to experience all of the elements at once — not physically, but visually.
Titled “SEA SKY LAND: towards a map of everything,” the exhibition features approximately 30 large format paintings and sculptures created by Enrique Martínez Celaya between 2005 and 2020. 
According to the exhibition’s official press release, the exhibition is the first time “the arc” of Martínez Celaya’s practice will be showcased in a museum in Southern California since 2001. 
Selma Holo, the executive director emerita of USC Museums, was originally connected to Martínez Celaya through a friend and colleague. After visiting his studio, she knew she wanted to showcase his work at the Fisher Museum. Holo also knew that with her retirement planned in a few years, she wanted this show to be her legacy.
Visually, the work captures one’s attention. With pieces that stand 20 or 30 feet tall, it is extremely easy to visit the museum and become lost in the grandiosity of the atmosphere. All of the works presented at the Fisher Museum are connected to one of three motifs — sea, sky and land.
Martínez Celaya’s careful use of color and poignant messages stand out as one walks through the gallery, moving through the elements. Each section of the exhibit was made to pair with the others, and although one may find a favorite painting, each one was made to be capable of transfixing its audience in a unique way. 
Holo said she was drawn to Martínez Celaya specifically because she “wanted to do something that was really emblematic of USC.” To her, that meant honoring the extreme interest in interdisciplinary work at the University, embodied by the scientist-artist-professor background of Martínez Celaya.
“When you are an artist, who is also interrogating the world from the position of science, poetry, literature, and just all the emotions that fill us up as human beings, you [are] somebody who I think can touch you in a very special way,” Holo said.
Nathalia Morales-Evanks, USC Museums director of communications and marketing, said that promoting Martínez Celaya has been “easy” because he is being featured all throughout the city right now, such as at The Huntington Library, Art Museum and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, Calif., and the UTA Artist Space.
Martínez Celaya’s work will also be on view in a concurrent exhibit in Edward L. Doheny Jr. Memorial Library. The exhibit draws on his recent residency at the Robinson Jeffers Tor House in Carmel, Calif., after being named the foundation’s inaugural fellow, and will present his work next to the 20th century poet’s historical material.
Holo said she also wanted to feature Martínez Celaya’s work as a representation of USC — a “great mosaic made up of so many different people with different backgrounds.” Martínez Celaya, who is Cubano, left Cuba at a young age and was educated in Spain and Puerto Rico before moving to various places in the United States. Many of Martínez Celaya’s pieces involve the idea of searching for a home or sense of belonging. In Holo’s essay in the catalog for this show, she calls his work a representation of “exilic imagination.” 
“Give yourself a treat … Let the work work on you. You’ll find yourself touched in ways that somehow the modern world doesn’t let us be … Artists give us permission to look at the world freshly,” Holo said. 
“Enrique Martínez Celaya, SEA SKY LAND: towards a map of everything” will be shown at the Fisher Museum until April 9. Admissions and programs are free and open to the public. 
“You could come every day, until April 9, and see something different,” Morales-Evanks said.

Last week, the Oscar nominations came out, and the Academy is once again embarrassing itself. 
Of course, there are some highlights from the nominations, such as Jane Campion being the first woman to be nominated for best director twice — this time for her work on “The Power of the Dog” (2021). Yet, even with that progress, there are fewer women nominated this year than in the past three. 
There were some wonderful surprises, such as “Drive My Car” (2021) which was nominated for Best Picture instead of just Best International Feature.
However, the award for “Least Surprising and Most Upsetting” nomination is awarded to “Don’t Look Up” (2021) for Best Picture.
For those that don’t know, “Don’t Look Up” is Adam McKay’s newest movie, chronicling society’s reaction, or lack thereof, to a meteor about to strike and destroy the Earth. The movie tries to convey an important message about the avoidance of addressing climate change, but its jokes are so oversaturated, it ends up feeling like a two-hour-long SNL cold open. 
Indeed, it seems like the only reason it’s getting any recognition from the Academy is for its star-studded cast. But a celebrity is not what makes a movie good, and a celebrity certainly isn’t what makes a movie worthy of Best Picture. Take away Streep, DiCaprio and the other A-list cameos, and would anyone even care about this movie?
Despite being the most-viewed American award show, the Academy Awards are losing their importance due to their lack of inclusion and self-awareness in favor of ‘Oscar-bait’ flicks like “Don’t Look Up.”
Since the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag came into popular use in 2015, some positive changes have occurred, but it’s hardly encouraging. The Academy is still over 84% white and 68% male. It also took until the 2020 awards for a non-English speaking film to win Best Picture, with “Parasite” (2019) director Bong Joon-ho notably calling out the Oscars for being a “local” show.
Yet the Oscars, and those in attendance each year, still regard the night as the most important in cinema. It’s supposedly a time to celebrate artistry and achievement, but more honestly, it’s often a night for the establishment to celebrate itself.
Here’s the thing, “Don’t Look Up” says nothing. McKay basically spends two hours telling audiences that ‘climate change is bad, but we aren’t really doing enough about it.’ Even the most surface-level conversations about climate change get past that very basic point.
Yet, the Academy ate it up. It’s easy to like a socially-conscious movie when there’s no room for debate. Unless you’re a climate change denier, there’s nothing this movie says that isn’t already known. 
This isn’t to say all movies need to be controversial to be good, but if you want to make a movie about a social issue, at least imbue it with some significance or call to action. The worst crime committed by “Don’t Look Up,” and the reason that it got its Oscar nom, is that it avoids putting accountability on anyone. Many Academy members, at least the most well-known, are wealthy and/or in high social standing. Therefore, they are in more of a position of power to change their lavish lifestyle or talk directly to officials, such as Academy member and “Don’t Look Up” star Leonardo DiCaprio attending the COP26 Conference. Since the movie does not address the Academy voters’ contribution to the climate crisis, the voters do not need to feel unsettled or threatened. 
McKay’s allegory for climate change is a comet descending towards the planet, but a comet and climate change are no way near the same thing for one main reason: a comet coming towards Earth is completely out of the control of the people. The comet is not their fault. In contrast, climate change is our fault. To their credit, the political corruption and greed that stopped the mission is a creative way to represent the wealth and bribery that stops the creation of restrictions on large corporations’ carbon emissions. 
However, by avoiding addressing the fault of the wealthy in the creation of climate change, “Don’t Look Up” avoids ruffling any feathers, especially those of the Academy voters. “Don’t Look Up” is the Academy voters’ dream: getting to feel socially conscious and morally superior without having to do any personal reflection. 
All I know is that I can’t wait for someone in an Alexander McQueen fur outfit, freshly flown in on a private jet to tell me that climate change does, in fact, exist.

Take a cruise down the Nile River with director Kenneth Branagh’s latest film, “Death on the Nile” (2022), released in theaters on Friday. “Death on the Nile” taps into a universal story thread that audiences respond to time and time again. Reeling in viewership by asking “whodunit,” mystery films like “Death on the Nile” are appealing because of their predictable approach and unpredictable conclusion. From whodunit to whydunit to howdunit, audiences can depend on this genre of film for consistency.
“Death on the Nile” retains elements of the classic “whodunit” mystery genre with a very close circle of suspects. With all of the cat-and-mouse narrative threads, red herrings, surprise elements and a trail of clues, the film does maintain a lot of similarity to the source material, Agatha Christie’s famous novel of the same name. However, while the film has consistency and some character, it also has a lot of concerns. 
The film looks at the upper echelons of society as a couple embarks for their honeymoon onboard the S.S. Karnak, destined to sail across the Nile River. The seemingly perfect trip is cut short as it becomes a search for a murderer. 
Visually, the film is a sight for sore eyes with an extremely appealing warm color palette and lavish backdrops. The grandiosity is more than appropriate, considering that this is a story of wealthy Europeans sailing through the Nile. Numerous wide shots establish the beauty of the Nile and the Karnak, but many of these shots feel slightly clogged by the huge, discernible amount of CGI involved that begins to make everything feel artificial. Despite this, the film is certainly gorgeous to look at and flows just like the Nile itself. 
One of the most enticing parts about the film is the huge ensemble cast, headlined by Branagh as famous detective Hercule Poirot, along with Armie Hammer, Gal Gadot, Tom Bateman, Annette Bening, Russell Brand, Emma Mackey, Ali Fazal, Dawn French, Sophie Okonedo, Jennifer Saunders and Letitia Wright to round out the cast. One of the challenges with navigating such a large cast can be developing each character’s individual narrative as needed and, unfortunately, Branagh’s film falls into this trap. The film doesn’t feel personable, and the fact that the audience almost spends more time trying to understand who the characters are rather than looking forward to the “whodunit” takes away from the purpose of the plot lines. 
“Death on the Nile” does have a huge elephant in the room – and we have to talk about it. One major cast member, Hammer, hasn’t been at recent promotional events and doesn’t have an individual character poster either. Hammer isn’t the only publicity nightmare — with some of Wright’s previous anti-vax statements and Gadot’s tone deaf ‘Imagine’ video coming to light as well — but it is certainly uncomfortable to watch him on screen considering all of the recent, horrifying allegations against him. In early 2021, Hammer was accused of violent rape and physical abuse, and his apparent cannabalistic pleasures were also leaked. It’s difficult to digest, and it doesn’t help that Hammer isn’t exactly playing the “good guy” in this film. The film’s producers said that the coronavirus pandemic was the reason as to why they couldn’t reshoot the film without Hammer, but his presence in the film, but absence in the promotion and publicity of the film, feels awkward — he should’ve been taken out. 
Branagh’s interpretation of Christie’s novel comes in as the fourth screen adaptation of the work thus far, and one of the positive parts is that it works hard to maintain the classic, old-timey feeling that feels so appropriate for “Death on the Nile.” Branagh blew it out of the water with 2017’s “Murder on the Orient Express,” which is also a Christie adaptation, grossing $350 million at the box office. In comparison, “Death on the Nile” feels like it is drowning and needs a life preserver. It’s a “watch once and never watch again” type of movie, and if you’re looking for a more captivating “whodunit,” you might be better off just reading Christie’s original novel.

At the mention of cryptocurrency five years ago, most people would’ve pictured a computer science geek running mystifying code in hopes of getting rich quick. Today, according to a 2021 survey by the Pew Research Center, it is estimated that 16% of Americans have previously held, or are currently holding, some amount of cryptocurrency. 
Where did this new movement come from, and exactly when did it make the move from a fringe idea to mainstream media and economics? Most importantly, what is the impact of this huge and largely unregulated shift toward cryptocurrencies?
Cryptocurrencies are a global phenomenon. Elon Musk, owner of Tesla, recently allowed customers to pay for new Teslas in Bitcoin, and El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as its national currency. The company that owns Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp recently changed its name to Meta (formerly Facebook) in preparation for the “metaverse,” the rapidly growing digital universe based largely on Ethereum. 
Even in our own University community, we are seeing the effects of this new age of digital currency. USC created a blockchain class, a blockchain minor and a course in the Marshall School of Business called “Internet Marketing,” which is being revamped this year to cover crypto. This recognition from “elite” research universities has likely helped crypto break into the mainstream.
The vision behind the metaverse is to create a digital universe for people to socialize, in which people can use crypto to buy plots of digital land as well as other assets, and it’s coming true. However, this exciting new world isn’t free and is coming at the expense of the one we already have.
The process of creating new cryptocurrency, known as mining, is an energy-intensive process. People gain new cryptocurrency as a reward for running transactions and using their high level computers to develop the blockchain. Just like conventional mining, this process is anything but harmless. According to BBC News, data that came out last year suggests that if Bitcoin were a country, it would consume more energy than Argentina, putting it in the top 30 most energy-inefficient countries in the world. Crypto’s carbon footprint falls just a bit short of the entire global banking industry, which uses an estimated 260 terawatt hours of energy per year according to TIME Magazine.
Even more shocking is the statistic that to mine a single dollar’s worth of Bitcoin is four to five times as costly to the environment as it would be to mine a single dollar’s worth of copper or gold, both of which are incredibly environmentally inefficient to extract. 
With the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference approaching, we expect to see major propositions for stricter plans to cut carbon emissions and double down on environmental protection. Meanwhile, whether driven by the desire to make easy money or by the fixation on technological innovation that has defined the last half-century, the crypto community continues to grow. 
The University’s gold rush mentality towards crypto and rapid course restructuring has more implications than just environmental ones. This perception of crypto as a novelty way to get rich quickly does not address the extreme volatility of crypto. Only last November, Bitcoin experienced one of its frequent crashes, losing an estimated 45% of its value and wiping over $1 trillion in Bitcoin. This potential to lose huge amounts of money at once is especially problematic for students whose expenses and debts can quickly become unmanageable, especially dealing with the high cost of living in Los Angeles.
This is not to say we need to stop the metaverse in its tracks. These are early days. Just as over time we were able to develop more efficient cars, there are already improvements being made to the efficiency of mining, but nowhere near the rate that these digital currencies are becoming increasingly popular. This is instead a call to action for those teaching the new crypto classes at USC. Crypto cannot be taught solely as a marketing class. In this era of climate crisis, you cannot separate the economics of Bitcoin from its environmental effects. 
While the metaverse is exciting and has huge names like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk on their toes hoping to get a bite, it’s not free, and it’s coming at too steep a price.

Content warning: The following contains spoilers of “Euphoria” and mentions sensitive topics, such as drug addiction and suicide. 
If you’re reading this, I’m assuming you too have fallen victim to the incessant “Euphoria” spoilers on Twitter and TikTok. You may also be entitled to financial compensation. 
Since its second season premiered last month, HBO Max’s “Euphoria” has monopolized entire social media platforms, with users abuzz over the show’s actors, content matter and aesthetic — we simply cannot talk about “Euphoria” without giving due credit to it for glittery eye makeup trends. 
Although the show is far from perfect, with scenes from its first season that indeed glamorize drug use with flashy, colorful aesthetics, its most recent episode manages to appropriately portray drug addiction. From another lens, its backlash invokes conversations about censorship and gatekeeping art. 
Emmy-award winner Zendaya’s character and show protagonist, Ruby “Rue” Bennett, struggles with a substance use disorder and other mental health issues. In episode five, “Stand Still Like the Hummingbird,” Rue’s friends confide in her mom that she broke her sobriety, which leads to her mom flushing her drugs down the toilet. Consequently, Rue screams, sobs, kicks a hole in a wooden door, hurls herself into oncoming traffic and sneaks into her friends’ and strangers’ houses to hunt for pills and jewelry to pawn. 
You cannot have an Emmy-worthy performance or any realistic depiction of mental illness, without somebody giving their unwarranted, out-of-pocket hot take. I saw tweets along the lines of “Rue would not have a drug addiction if she was fully Black” or “Rue is so selfish for doing this to her family.” Let’s be clear: Drug addiction does not discriminate based on race, and it is a disease that people cannot control. 
Additionally, Drug Abuse Resistance Education, an anti-drug education program for children and teens, chimed into the conversation with a denunciation of the show: “Rather than further each parent’s desire to keep their children safe from the potentially horrific consequences of drug abuse and other high-risk behavior, HBO’s television drama, ‘Euphoria,’ chooses to misguidedly glorify and erroneously depict high school student drug use, addiction, anonymous sex, violence, and other destructive behaviors as common and widespread in today’s world.”
Ironically, D.A.R.E. itself does not have the best track record when it comes to drug abuse prevention. According to a 10-year longitudinal study conducted by the American Psychological Association, researchers found few differences in drug use and drug attitudes between two groups of 20 year olds, one which received D.A.R.E.’s curriculum and another which received a standard drug education curriculum. 
With this episode’s backlash, we see a paradigm of gatekeeping art. D.A.R.E., founded during the Reagan-era, racist, War on Drugs hysteria, believes this media must not be created at all because of “the children” — except, we know that “because of the children” is a very politically-charged scapegoat. Let D.A.R.E serve as a reminder that, like abstinence-only sex education programs and critical race theory erasure, zero-tolerance drug education programs only abnormalize already stigmatized topics. 
But we must look at artists’ intention and purpose. Some might disseminate art to a particular audience without any regulation or any research on its potential harm. Others might showcase their craft with the goal of highlighting humanity and evoking compassion from their audience. 
Creator of “Euphoria,” Sam Levinson, in fact, based the show on his own experience with drug addiction and rehab as a teenager. It also establishes a rating for mature audiences and content warnings. 
On the other hand, “13 Reasons Why” author, Jay Asher, did not conduct research on safely portraying suicide — he merely talked to his niece who attempted killing herself — before writing a story that recklessly portrays Hannah Baker’s suicide as an act of revenge and her character as, according to GoodTherapy, a “heroine” and “modern-day martyr.” Indeed, the show provoked copycat suicides across the world. 
Amid calls to censor “Euphoria,” Tennessee school systems continue censoring books such as “Maus,” Art Spiegelman’s acclaimed graphic novel that depicts the Holocaust through mice, cats and pigs. 
You can’t make it up — staunch defenders of First Amendment rights, who (misleadingly) tout “1984” and “Fahrenheit 451” as warnings against free speech bans on violent political commentators such as Joe Rogan, suddenly think censorship is necessary when books discuss topics that make them “uncomfortable” — topics such as, unsurprisingly, racism, anti-Semitism and, surprisingly, naked animated mice. 
If we want to talk about censorship, we must acknowledge its politicization that continues stigmatizing already-stigmatized issues. D.A.R.E. and others’ concerns with “Euphoria” come from places of ignorance toward drug abuse and a gatekeeping complex that ultimately harms the people they seek to protect. Like books’ censorship in Tennessee, these views only further oppress marginalized communities’ voices. 
With responsible portrayals of mental illness, entertainment media can find a way to narrate mental illness’ reality without glamorizing it. In the meantime, we can keep dabbling in the art of eye makeup.

The last month of Trojan basketball has been one for the books. After starting the year off on a cold streak, USC fought back with a series of Pac-12 victories against Colorado, Utah and Arizona State. 
In their first true test of the season, the Trojans fell to Arizona 63-72. Critics of Head Coach Andy Enfield and Co. felt vindicated by this loss, arguing that USC has an inflated record and cannot hold their own against talented teams. 
Those that were in McKale Memorial Center that night know that is not the case. 
USC kept the game within 5 for almost the entire game against a very talented Arizona team, even taking a steady lead at some points. 
However, a loss is a loss, and the reason the Trojans were defeated at Arizona has been a constant theme this season: inconsistent offense. 
One week, junior guard Boogie Ellis was scoring 2 points against Arizona State; the next week, senior guard Drew Peterson was scoring 5 against Arizona. Unreliable offense has plagued the Trojans all season, especially at the free-throw line, and USC has rarely had all of their stars operating in tandem. 
To defeat a team like UCLA, USC had to come out of the locker room with a more cohesive offensive approach, and boy did they. 
Even with junior forward Isaiah Mobley out, the USC offense had a field day. Peterson exited his slump in style, scoring 27 points in a double-double effort. Peterson and redshirt senior forward Chevez Goodwin cleaned the glass all night, combining for 18 defensive rebounds, 11 and 7 respectively. 
The Trojans were also an impossible matchup around the arc, shooting 44.4% from three. As UCLA began to close out on shooters faster in the second half, USC guards were able to penetrate a usually formidable Bruin defense and kick it out to open shooters. 
In hindsight, this win was foreseeable.
UCLA was coming off of rough losses against Arizona and Arizona State and has also struggled in a few key areas USC excels in. The Bruins’ 3-point shooting is very mediocre, which is helpful for a USC team that has a hard time defending beyond the arc. 
USC is also one of the taller teams in the NCAA, and UCLA does not have comparable length on their roster. Conversely, Arizona was able to counter this length by getting the ball to their star bigs like 6-foot-11 sophomore forward Azuolas Tubelis and 7-foot junior center Oumar Ballo.
After defeating UCLA, USC is in prime position to earn a No. 4 or No. 5 seed on Selection Sunday depending on how they fare in rematches against Arizona and UCLA next month.
A rank of this degree would do wonders to help them repeat or even outshine their March Madness performance last season. 
Despite the seeding, with Arizona, USC and UCLA trading shots, the Pac-12 will undoubtedly have its presence felt in March.
USC will have to continue to find answers on offense in unexpected places if they want to make a deep run in the postseason. The Trojans defeated UCLA, while missing their best big in Mobley and getting 0 points from Ellis, their main ball handler. If a win in that scenario is possible, anything is possible for USC in March.  
Across the NCAA, things have been heating up in the last week. 
Texas has emerged as a possible Elite Eight candidate after beating Kansas in a thriller last week. Senior forward Timmy Allen hit a clutch shot to give the Longhorns the lead in the final minute. 
After defeating USC, Oregon had won 7 of 8 games and were on the right side of the bubble. Now, after a demoralizing loss to UC Berkeley, their chances of being the fourth Pac-12 team in the NCAA tournament are significantly diminished. 
The Wyoming Cowboys, a team that has become a fan favorite this season, has made it over the hump and will likely appear in the postseason for the first time since 2015. 
After being ranked No. 6 in the nation in the preseason, Michigan has been a massive disappointment this season. The Wolverines could find themselves at home in March after advancing to the Elite Eight in 2021 even after an impressive blowout of No. 5 Purdue last Thursday. 
Auburn was dethroned as the top seed in the AP poll after losing to Arkansas. Gonzaga returned to the top spot and is well positioned for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament along with Auburn. 
Besides Auburn and Gonzaga, it’s anyone’s guess who will earn top seeds. It is shaping up to be a very unpredictable March Madness, and if the cards fall right, USC could find itself back in the Elite Eight. 
Trojan fans will have to endure a quiet couple of weeks facing lesser Pac-12 opponents until their rematch against the Wildcats on Mar. 1.

Baseball’s 2022 season starts Friday, Feb. 18 with a series against Santa Clara. Last season, the Trojans finished under .500, but a new injection of talent along with returning starters will drive a team with higher aspirations this year. Here are five players to look out for as the team begins its season. 
Sophomore catcher Garret Guillemette:
Guillemette’s breakout freshman season sets him up to be a key contributor this year. He slashed a .299 batting average, good for second-best on the team, with a .370 on-base percentage. He mostly hit for contact last season, totaling 10 doubles and 3 home runs. Taking the step to the next level will involve getting more power behind his swing. 
 Guillemette held his own on the defensive side of the ball as well. He led the team with 292 putouts, boasting a .994 fielding percentage on the year. As a catcher, his defensive capabilities are all the more important to the success of the team. 
If Guillemette picks up where he left off in his rookie season, he’s poised to be an important bat near the top of the lineup and a defensive stalwart. 
Redshirt senior starting pitcher Isaac Esqueda
Esqueda is one of the most experienced pitchers on the staff this season, bringing four years of collegiate experience to the table. Last season, he led USC in innings pitched, carrying the load as a starter. He shapes up to be the Trojans’ ace this season. 
The redshirt senior pitcher registered a 3.47 ERA and a 6-3 record in 14 starts last season. His ability to eat up innings while keeping runners off the bases gives the Trojans flexibility down the stretch in games. 
Esqueda has come a long way since being ranked the 320th best prospect in the class of 2017, and he will be a crucial component in USC’s upcoming season.  
Freshman pitcher Eric Hammond 
Hammond was one of USC’s top recruits in the 2021 class, registering as the No. 3 overall prospect out of Texas and the No. 1 overall right-handed pitcher in the state. The Arizona Diamondbacks drafted him in the 19th round of the 2021 MLB draft, but he opted against going pro in favor of committing to USC.  
Hammond’s 6 foot 4, 185-pound frame immediately puts him amongst the big leaguers in terms of size, and he has a repertoire of four pitches, including a fastball in the mid-90s. 
Oozing with potential, time will tell if Hammond can meet the Trojans’ expectations. 
Redshirt sophomore outfielder Rhylan Thomas
Thomas is another young piece in the USC squad who had an impressive beginning to his collegiate career. He’s already accrued two years of experience after redshirting his freshman season, appearing in a total of 64 games. 
Last season was a step forward for Thomas, holding the team’s third-best batting average at .296 as well as the third-most RBIs with 25. 
Thomas committed just 1 error over the course of his last two seasons, proving to be a reliable defender in the Trojans’ outfield. 
Redshirt junior first baseman/designated hitter Clay Owens
After losing one of their top power bats in Ben Ramirez, the Trojans will lean on Owens to provide extra-base hits this season. He led the team with 12 home runs last season, starting in all 51 games. 
In terms of batting average, Owens has yet to establish consistency. He slashed a .346 average in 2020, but last season saw him regress to .253. A key to his success at the plate is continuing to draw a high amount of walks, as he tied for the second-most walks on last season’s squad with 26.
Owens has room to improve on defense, as he committed 6 errors last season for a .980 fielding percentage. The Trojans leaned on him heavily last season, and improvement on his part could take the team to the next level.
