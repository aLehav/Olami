Rick Caruso, billionaire businessman and current chair of the USC Board of Trustees, announced his candidacy for mayor of Los Angeles on Friday.
“I believe in the LA dream — and I know that we can end homelessness, crime, and corruption. But the politicians can’t,” Caruso wrote in a Twitter post. “That’s why today I formally began the process of running for Mayor of Los Angeles.”
Caruso — an independent since 2012 — registered as a Democrat Jan. 24.
“I won’t be a typical Democrat, that’s for sure,” wrote Caruso in a letter posted to Twitter following the registration. “I will be a pro-centrist, pro-jobs, pro-public safety Democrat.”
The City Clerk’s office confirmed to the Los Angeles Times Wednesday of Caruso’s intent to file paperwork Friday and declare his candidacy. He will join 16 other candidates in this year’s mayoral election, including USC alumna Karen Bass and city councilmember Kevin de León.
Caruso was elected chair of USC’s Board of Trustees in 2018, a week following former University President Max Nikias’s resignation following sexual assault allegations against former USC gynecologist George Tyndall. In March 2021, the University reached an $852 million settlement with more than 700 survivors — the largest sexual abuse settlement filed against any university.
After being elected, Caruso pledged greater University accountability and headed the Special Committee of the Board of Trustees, promising to conduct an independent investigation into Tyndall’s misconduct and a subsequent report.
But during a March 2021 student media briefing, Caruso said a formal report was never created, citing it would cause “more pain and suffering to the victim” by releasing them.
Olivia Jade was aboard Caruso’s yacht in 2019 when she learned the federal government indicted her mother, actress Lori Loughlin, for bribing the University to admit Jade. Jade and her sister, Isabella Rose, disenrolled from USC in October later that year.
After graduating from USC in 1980, Caruso founded and became CEO of real estate development company Caruso. In 2001, Caruso was elected the president of the Los Angeles Police Commission, where he oversaw the rejection of former LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks’ bid for a second term and the selection of Parks’ replacement, former New York City Police Commissioner William J. Bratton. 
Caruso has since served as a Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission member and founded the Caruso Family Foundation, a philanthropic organization dedicated to providing “high quality educational opportunities and access to superior healthcare” to underserved families in L.A.
Caruso also owns The Grove and The Americana at Brand, among other widely successful retail centers in the United States.
Caruso and his wife Tina made multiple donations to the University, including $6 million in 2006 to redesign and rename the USC Catholic Community Center, and another $25 million in 2015 to endow the USC Tina and Rick Caruso Department of Otolaryngology. 
All four of Caruso’s children attended USC.
USC declined to comment on Caruso’s candidacy. 
Caruso first expressed interest in running for mayor in 2010. A 2019 New York Times profile of Caruso was the first to mention his interest for running in the 2022 election cycle.
Primary elections for L.A. mayor will be held June 7.

United States District Court Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton sentenced Gamal Abdelaziz to one year and one day in prison for his role in the Operation Varsity Blues bribery scheme Wednesday — the longest sentence as a result of the scandal — according to a Department of Justice press release published the same day.
Abdelaziz, a former Las Vegas casino and resort executive, was also sentenced to two years of supervised release and 400 hours of community service and issued a $250,000 fine. 
A federal jury convicted Abdelaziz Oct. 8 for conspiring to bribe USC coaches and other athletic officials to admit his daughter to USC as a “basketball recruit,” despite the fact that Abdelaziz’s daughter did not make her high school’s varsity team. 
Abdelaziz was also convicted of committing mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud on one count. In March 2018, he wired William “Rick” Singer — the scheme’s facilitator who modified test scores to fraudulently admit students to elite schools as varsity athletes — a lump sum of $300,000 following his daughter’s official acceptance to the University, according to the press release. 
Singer also coordinated with former associate senior athletic director Donna Heinel and former assistant women’s soccer coach Laura Janke to fabricate an athletic profile and secure Abdelaziz’s daughter’s acceptance. 
Abdelaziz claimed he believed his donations to Singer were legitimate, but prosecutors cited secretly recorded phone calls between the two that show Abdelaziz’s knowledge of the scheme.
More than 50 parents have been charged in the scandal, including 18 in relation to USC. High profile names have faced shorter sentences, such as “Desperate Housewives” star Felicity Huffman who received 14 days in prison, one year of supervised release, 250 hours of community service and a $30,000 fine for her sentence. Released early, Huffman only served 11 days in prison.
“Full House” Actress Lori Loughlin was sentenced to two months in prison, two years of supervised release, 100 hours of community service and ordered to pay a $150,000 fine. Her husband Mossimo Giannulli was sentenced to five months in prison, two years of supervised release, 250 hours of community service and a $250,000 fine.
Abdelaziz’s sentence, although the longest of all those given to other participants, is shorter than the maximum sentences for his convicted charges. Mail and wire fraud is punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater. Federal programs bribery provides for a sentence of up to five years’ imprisonment, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater.
Ahead of the sentencing, Abdelaziz’s lawyers wrote that the former resort executive should only receive four months in prison, arguing that Abdelaziz should not receive a longer term than others’ because he pleaded not guilty. 
Abdelaziz’s lawyer Brian Kelly, a part of the Nixon Peabody firm, did not respond to the Daily Trojan in time for publication. According to the New York Times, Kelly said that he hopes to “vindicate” Abdelaziz through the appeals process.
Nixon Peabody has represented USC in past cases involving health care and intellectual property. Abdelaziz filed a request to use the law firm as his defense in June 2019, contending that there was no conflict of interest. 
John Wilson, another parent convicted Oct. 8, will face sentencing Feb. 16. 
USC declined to comment on Abdelaziz’s sentencing.

Content warning: This article contains references to sexual assault.
Disclaimer: All names in this article have been replaced with pseudonyms per the request of sources to protect their identity and privacy.  
It was Riley’s first day of class in Spring 2018 when her professor asked her out to dinner. Then a sophomore, the 2020 graduate thought the academic she looked up to wanted to discuss the class. She soon realized she was mistaken. 
Over the course of the semester, the professor, who Riley said still works at the University, made advances toward her, made her stay back after class under the pretext of discussing classwork, harassed her to come to his house and constantly messaged her over social media. 
According to the Los Angeles Times, which cited a 2019 survey conducted by the Association of American Universities, one in four undergraduate females are sexually assaulted on campuses across the country. At USC, the statistics are almost one in three, 31% of female undergraduates responding they were sexually assaulted during their time at the University. 
In the classroom
Following dinner with her professor at a “fancy” restaurant, Riley wanted to call an Uber back home, but the professor did not let her, insisting on driving her home even though he was drunk. 
“He’s a very well-respected and well-known academic, so I believe that he uses that power to get what he wants and not get caught,” Riley said. “It worked on me because I started to know what was happening but didn’t fully realize it because of how much respect he has. And I thought I would just go along with it because I respected him too.”
Despite “forceful insistence,” Riley never went to his house or office, fearful of what the professor might do if she were alone with him. Still, he often made her stay after class and sat very close to her.
“I don’t know anyone else that has had this happen, but I feel very confident that it must have happened to other people just because of how quickly it happened to me,” Riley said. “It wasn’t a slow escalation. It was the first class that I ever had with this person.”
As Riley slowly started creating more distance from the professor, she said it began to reflect in her grades. After receiving a final grade lower than she expected, she emailed the professor and got a “nasty reply” where he said she wasn’t a good student — a stark departure from everything he had told her at the beginning of the semester. 
Prominence in Greek Life
Beyond the classroom, incidents of sexual assaults are commonly reported within Greek life. On Oct. 20, the Department of Public Safety sent a communitywide email about multiple reports of drugging and sexual assault at the Sigma Nu Fraternity House. In the week following the initial email, DPS reported additional druggings and sexual assaults at Sigma Nu and other fraternities spanning from Nov. 10, 2018 to Fall 2021. 
The USC community held multiple protests on the Row, outside Sigma Nu and in front of Bovard Auditorium following the initial DPS email and throughout the rest of the semester. Ashley, a sophomore, joined the protests as a survivor of sexual assault at a fraternity. She did not want to include the fraternity’s name included in the article.
During the virtual semester, Ashley, a sophomore living at an off-campus student housing complex near USC, would go to her neighbors’ small fraternity parties. At one of the parties, she felt more drunk than usual, even though she hadn’t had a lot to drink and ended up blacking out after an hour. 
The next day, she found out from girls who were at the party that, when she tried to leave, the vice president of the fraternity, who had been following her around and bartending that night, took her to his room to give her a mask because she didn’t have one. She didn’t return for a while and had no recollection of the night. 
“No one really asked questions because they all thought that I got the mask and left. I ended up finding out the next day from the president of the frat that I was [sexually assaulted] that night by the vice president,” Ashley said. “[The vice president] would text me over the summer as well, just kind of following up, making sure that I wouldn’t tell anyone.” 
When Olivia, a 2020 graduate, found out about “everything going on” at USC, she decided not to return for homecoming out of fear of “running into certain people.”
As a gender and social justice minor, Olivia said she was aware of the resources offered by USC to survivors of sexual assault. However, it wasn’t until she had to use them after being sexually assaulted by a close friend in a fraternity that she realized the difficulty of navigating them after an assault. 
After her drunk friend put his hand in her pants and touched her inappropriately when he thought she was asleep, Olivia “froze” and didn’t know what to do. She wanted to put as much distance between them as she could, but didn’t know if she would take any further action.   
“I was really upset about it, and I was kind of second guessing myself. I didn’t think that I was going to report it or anything like that,” Olivia said. “What I kept saying to myself [was that] it could have been way worse. It could have been so much worse … But eventually I was like, ‘Wait, you literally have written papers on this and how no one reports anything. Why would you not report this? Because it’s still assault. You know, it’s still sexual assault. He didn’t have consent. So, that’s kind of what pushed me to finally go in.” 
Following the incident, Olivia decided to fill out a Callisto form, which allows survivors to document details of their assault in case they decide to file a report in the future.  Eventually, Olivia decided to go to Title IX after she saw her assaulter with one of her sorority sisters at her sorority’s invite.
“I think that if I was not a gender and social justice minor, with these very strong thoughts already, that I probably would not have reported it especially given — it’s bad to say — the low severity of it,” Olivia said. “At the same time, the low severity is what nudged me to report, because I was kind of like, ‘This is the whole point, right?’ Guys think they can get away with this stuff because it’s not ‘rape,’ and they think that that’s OK.” 
For Chloe, a sophomore majoring in law, history and culture, being a survivor at USC felt isolating even before the incidents at Sigma Nu. When she worried about safety at fraternity parties, people told her she “just [had] to go to the right frat.” However, following the DPS email, many of her friends shared stories of being sexually assaulted at fraternities.  
“Less severe forms of sexual assault, like groping, are so common at frat parties that people don’t even act like they’re assaults when they completely are, and it’s just been really heartbreaking,” Chloe said. 
Even before learning about her friends’ stories of sexual assault, Chloe described feeling “dehumanized” at fraternity parties because the parties were “built so that all the frat boys can have all the access to women they could possibly want.”  
“Just seeing my friends who weren’t survivors go through everything that I’ve gone through being a survivor for four years now — it just shatters my heart,” Chloe said. “My friends and all these women who used to move through life with joy just turned into shells of themselves … It’s just so incredibly unfair because rapists aren’t affected by rape. They don’t care, but it feels like a part of you has died for a little while.”
Consequences of reporting
According to the Association of American Universities survey, 84% of undergraduate and 87.4% of graduate students who experienced sexual harassment did not report the incident to any University resource. Riley had used Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Services — a University therapy service for gender and power-based harm —  to help her heal from a “previous sexual trauma” unrelated to USC, but she didn’t trust USC resources to protect her in this case. 
Riley said she confided in a woman professor in the same department, who reported the incident on her behalf to the department, the Office of Ombuds and Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. However, no one reached out to Riley, and the professor did not recieve a response even after following up.  
“[The lack of action] made me really not trust USC — that they care about my safety, that they care about student safety,” Riley said. “It was definitely a slap in the face and made me hate an institution that I had loved because I didn’t feel like it cared about me.” 
Meanwhile, confiding in her professor affected Riley, who found herself “unable to attend class and do [her] homework for weeks.” Fear of USC’s inaction — based on other experiences she had heard about  — and risk of the case consuming her life, prevented her from coming forward. Mixed with this fear was the guilt of not stopping the professor from behaving similarly with other students. 
“I know that I could have gone to the Title IX office immediately and gotten an investigation, but I had a friend my freshman year of college where I was a witness to a Title IX case,” Riley said. “It was traumatic for me just as a witness to go through the Title IX process, of how much they questioned me and how much time it took out of my life … I felt like I wouldn’t be able to do school if I did a Title IX investigation against him.”
“[The lack of action] made me really not trust USC. It was definitely a slap in the face and made me hate an institution that I had loved because I didn’t feel like it cared about me.” 
Olivia echoed Riley’s sentiment and said she wouldn’t have been able to go through the reporting process during a normal semester. Her entire trial took place during a remote semester when, as a senior in her last semester, she was only taking two classes. That gave her the time to look over documents that were sent to her by Title IX, make notes and send back questions — all of which was a required part of the process.    
“It’s probably extremely hard for someone to have to do while they have a normal set of USC classes, and I don’t think that there’s any support offered in that regard,” Olivia said.   
Olivia said she found herself  “pleasantly surprised” when the Title IX process ended with the University suspending her assaulter for a semester because she said “that doesn’t happen to a lot of people with Title IX.”
Holding fraternities accountable for members’ actions and making rapists fear consequences might be the only thing that helps, Chloe said. However, putting survivors through the “incredibly exhausting process” of reporting and going through a court process that can take months worries her. 
“I don’t think that more sexual assault training will help,” Chloe said. “How is learning about consent going to stop someone who’s roofieing? How the hell can you actually believe that they don’t know exactly what they’re doing? They know exactly what they’re doing. You can’t roofie someone and think that it’s consensual, and what the hell is more training going to do about that?”
Next steps forward
Hannah initially thought the University was handling the reports of drugging and sexual assault at Sigma Nu well because of emails flooding her inbox and professors sharing University resources. However, after attending a party in November, the freshman found herself having difficulty finding help for a non-USC student who was assaulted within the Fryft zone and said USC needed to do more. 
After having difficulty finding RSVP’s number, Hannah finally connected with someone, but she said she felt like the person on the line had never dealt with a sexual assault situation and did not know what to do. Since the event took place off-campus and the student didn’t go to USC, she said she was told the University couldn’t do anything and they would have to go to the police.  
“The person who answered was very nice, and they were helpful, but you could tell that they didn’t really have any training or idea what to do,” Hannah said. “When I said the word assault, they were like ‘Oh, wow’ and … put me on hold for a very long time.” 
For Olivia, the University’s unwillingness to adopt student suggestions and lack of progress has been especially frustrating. As part of a special topics gender studies class she took in Fall 2018, she and her classmates presented a list of actionable items that the University could implement to administrators to make students feel safer. The items included suggestions such as increasing the number of streetlights between the Row and campus, but Olivia said none of their ideas were implemented.
“I had a classmate who was on the USC Sexual Assault Task Force all four years, and they would always make recommendations and meet with administration,” Olivia said. “Nothing that they ever recommended ever came to fruition.”
USC announced a Working Group on Interfraternity Council Culture, Prevention, and Accountability in a communitywide email Nov. 11. that was supposed to make initial recommendations by Dec. 17, 2021. The group’s initial recommendations, including requiring security to be stationed at stairs and hallways leading to bedrooms, event planning oversight and mandated sexual assault and harrasment trainings for all members before resumption of social events, were announced in a campuswide email Jan. 18 by Provost Charles Zukoski.
Chloe said the creation of the committee felt like USC was waiting until things blew over and students were back home for winter break. Like other universities, she said she believes USC delays its response when students make demands until they get busy with school, finals or until leaders of the movement graduate. 
“I really thought things had changed because we have a female president, and I thought what happened with George Tyndall couldn’t possibly happen again,” Chloe said. “I doubt that something of that caliber could, but I think I forgot that USC covered up what happened with Tyndall for decades. So, how can I really expect this school to stand with survivors when they wouldn’t even stand up for survivors when it was one of their own?”

When you talk to junior guard Rejean “Boogie” Ellis, there’s a coolness about him. The way he talks is soft; he’s polite and mild-mannered when answering questions. 
But beneath him, there’s an intense drive. It can be set off easily, and when it is, it’s noticeable. 
In the middle of interviewing Ellis, his eyes shot up to the side — like a kid who hears an ice cream truck. His calm demeanor snapped and his eyebrows furrowed.
Ellis stopped to ask a question. 
“Are you guys playing right now?” he said. “I’m tryna shoot.”
Talking directly to a USC practice player making his way to the court, Ellis had just finished an hour-and-a-half long practice and a 20-minute weight lifting session. But he couldn’t stay relaxed. He wanted to get some extra reps. 
Ellis scored 21 points — a season high — on an efficient 8-for-10 shooting against UC Berkeley two days before. It was the first game the guard scored over 20 since USC’s season opener and the eighth 20-point game in his collegiate career.
Ellis lives to prove people wrong. He’s described as a workaholic and a “very driven individual” who loves to perform on the big stage. His excessive work out got to a point where his high school coach called Ellis’ dad to tell him the guard needed to take a break. 
“I had been getting calls from a couple of people that know me, and let me know he was up at the gym working,” Mission Bay High School coach Marshawn Cherry said. “We’ve had a few incidents like that where he’s supposed to be on break and he sneaks into the gym.” 
Ellis’ journey from a 4-star high school recruit to USC starter did not come easy. Even with the highs and lows of life, what stayed constant for Ellis was simple: He never stopped working. 
“I knew this ones gonna be freaking good”
Ellis started playing basketball at 5-years-old, mentioning the game stuck with him.
Growing up, he wasn’t the most athletic player though. Ellis relied more on his skill, working and working on developing his game. 
“Staying in the gym, working on my craft and getting better, then trying to get better and better every day,” Ellis said. “And staying hungry, eager to learn.”
That hunger and drive came from the people around him: His dad, older brother and grandpa had a large part in his development. To this day, his older brother gets on every little thing and pushes Ellis to his limits. While his grandpa was playing basketball, Ellis would stay in the car seat near him. 
Ellis came up under hard-working players too such as Trey Kell who went to San Diego State and Justin Moore who played at Georgia Tech. Ellis watched their work ethic and applied it, Cherry said.
Cherry witnessed Ellis’ evolution. He met the guard when Ellis was in sixth grade, coaching him all the way through high school. 
Cherry’s first encounter with Ellis when he was in sixth grade still sticks out 10 years later. Back then, Ellis played on Sweetwater High School’s freshman team against Cherry’s eighth-grade team. 
“We beat his team by 30, but he had about 20 points for them playing up three years. He was just out there competing,” Cherry said. “Right then, I knew that this ones gonna be freaking good.”
Ellis sacrificed to live up to the hype. As high school came around, he took it to another level. It was all about hooping.  
“My whole high school career, I didn’t go out that much. I was missing a lot of stuff. Throughout high school and in middle school, I had to sacrifice,” he said. “I will continue to sacrifice to get to where I want to be.”
Proving people wrong and committing to college
It was a junior varsity game during Ellis’ freshman year at Mission Bay. He had recently enrolled at the school, following Cherry who was an associate at the time. 
Cherry knew what Ellis was capable of, but the staff wanted him to prove it. Instead of playing on varsity, Cherry and then-coach Dennis Kane, decided junior varsity would be the move. 
Dropping 60 points, Ellis proved them wrong. He was moved to varsity immediately after the game. 
Something more than the point total stuck out for Cherry though, he saw Ellis’ certain motivation to prove everyone wrong.
Cherry said Ellis took it as disrespect that he was put on JV. And, most of the time, disrespect or fans doubting him is all it takes to tick Ellis off. 
He loves when he’s told another player is better than him. He loves when you count him out. He loves when the crowd starts to heckle him. It ignites that fire and passion inside of him to prove everyone wrong, ultimately leading to more hard work. 
Ellis was glued to the gym, putting up shots. While some families would vacation during the summer, he didn’t want to take a break. 
“In the summer, we’d set up a schedule where he worked out three times a day, five days a week,” Cherry said. “[Then] on weekends, you’d have games or tournaments.”
He wanted to succeed, but it took time. 
Ellis averaged 7 points per game in his freshman year and then, as a sophomore at Mission Bay, went 19-11.
As a junior, Ellis averaged 24 points, 6 rebounds and 6 assists en route to an Open Division CIF title and being named San Diego Section Player of the Year. 
But Ellis was still an under-the-radar prospect. 
In 2018, Ellis decided to join the Nike Elite Youth Basketball Tournament, which houses a culmination of young basketball talent from across the country in an Amateur Athletic Union team structure of teams. Ellis joined the Oakland Soldiers in 2018, averaging 17 points while shooting 46% from deep.
For Ellis, he was excited for a chance to prove he was one of the top players in the country. 
The offers quickly fluttered in after the tournament: Duke, North Carolina, Gonzaga, Arizona State and, of course, USC — the latter being the first Power Five conference school to offer him a scholarship. 
“We always liked him,” Head Coach Andy Enfield said. “He was developing as a player, but we loved his toughness and his speed and his scoring ability, and then he became a really good player.”
Ellis eventually committed to Duke in November 2018 but decommitted six months later after sophomore Blue Devils guard Tre Jones decided to return for another year. 
“I did what was best for me. You could say that a lot of people hated the decision, and it was whatever, but at the end of the day, I got to do what I got to do,” he said. “What they say doesn’t really matter.”  
A week-and-a-half later, Ellis committed to Memphis to play under former All-Star guard Penny Hardaway. 
Coming back home from Memphis 
That first college season was difficult for Ellis.
He began the year strong but fizzled out as the games went on. Back-to-back scoreless games and a 2-point outing prompted Hardaway to bench him mid-way through the season. 
“That was the kind of the first time in my whole entire life I really struggled with basketball, so it was a time for me to grow,” he said. “Then I came back the next year, and I feel like I got better.”
When you thought you had him, Ellis would make you say: “OK, maybe I’m wrong.” Ellis had 24 points in the first game next year then double-digit figures in six of the first seven games of the season. 
As the big games in March came around, Ellis rose. He dropped 27 against No. 7 Houston in the American Athletic Conference semi-finals then 23 in the NIT championship game. 
“I feel like I played well, but I still didn’t live up to what I was supposed to be,” he said. 
Two weeks after his final game, Ellis made the move back home, transferring to USC. 
After the Trojans’ top-scoring guard Tahj Eaddy declared for the draft, there became a need for the position. 
“I thought it was a great fit all around for him and for us,” Enfield said. “He’s really had a terrific season so far and he keeps improving. I think he’s going to get better and better as time goes on.” 
The 6-foot-3 guard’s offensive output has had double-digit points in 11 of the Trojans’ last 13 games. He also had back-to-back 21-point games against Cal and Arizona State.  
“There’s a lot of upside with him being a true point guard [and] league guard that can score because he’s developing into that,” Enfield said. “We think his potential has not been reached yet. We’re really excited to see.”
Ellis’ killer mentality, obtained from idols Kobe Bryant and Allen Iverson, is evident when the clock nears zero. According to Ellis, he’s never missed a game-winning shot in his career. How true that will continue to be really remains up in the air. 
But if you know anything about Ellis, he’s probably telling the truth. When you count him out, he makes you remember your mistakes. The bigger the moment, the better Ellis plays.
When times get tough and doubts creep in during March Madness, it’ll be like Ellis is back in high school, missing parties to put up shots.
“[Anytime] that he thinks that you’re against him, he wants to make sure he proves you wrong,” Cherry said. “That’s his greatest motivation. With him is, if I challenged him, I know I got the best out of him.”

Gender inclusivity and asking for pronouns has become a part of everyday life in college classrooms and other settings around USC. You would think that with every professor and icebreaker stressing pronouns as part of preliminary introductions, assuming one’s pronouns has become less and less common. 
As someone who wears a pronouns pin from the LGBTQ+ Student Center, lists their pronouns on social media platforms and writes a multitude of name tags for classes and work where indicating pronouns is a requirement, you’d be surprised at how swiftly the adjective “her” gets uttered to describe me. 
There still exists a misconception nonbinary people must look androgynous or have a certain physical characteristic that is qualifiable as a “they/them.” But, hey, I have braids in my hair 90% of the time, wear skirts and dresses and wear feminine makeup, and somehow, that warrants an “It’s OK” or another form of validation to people who mispronoun me. 
The truth is sometimes a pit of guilt in my stomach comes around when I say my pronouns are “they/them” and that somehow I am not worthy of being nonbinary because I am mainly feminine presenting. 
It feels like writing pronouns on name tags or introducing yourself with pronouns are paper-thin promises that have no real meaning since, two seconds later, someone’s pronouns are ignored and appearance becomes synonymous with identity. 
It truly is funny how a two-hour lecture would focus on diversity and inclusivity in the workroom — with a hyperfocus on making sure students have pronouns in their Slack name — then soon after hearing “She is…” when referring to me.  
And yes, some people apologize for mispronouning — a thing that should become way more common than it actually is — but whenever this happens to me, I always end up being the one who says, “No worries” and continue to be an active apologist for the culture of applying binary ideas to nonbinary identities. 
Nonbinary does not have a prerequisite of wearing baggy clothes or having short hair with a mid-deep voice. If that is how someone expresses themselves then that is totally valid, but no, there is not a checklist to check off to feel as though “they/them” is indicative of who they are. 
There are nonbinary people who are hypermasculine or hyperfeminine or maybe understand the comfort of Lululemon leggings and a T-shirt. Yet, these physical binary notions continue to haunt the sphere of nonbinaryness and how the predominantly cis world, especially at USC, understands these identities. 
The only meaningful way to make strides in creating a safe environment for nonbinary people is erasing personal misconceptions of what pronouns “look like.” Instead of focusing on the base level of asking for pronouns, we should be reevaluating our own biases and societal norms. Until that happens, I and others will continue to feel the discomfort and disappointment of amounting to our physical appearance as an indicator of our identity.

No. 21 men’s basketball will face off against their crosstown rivals No. 12 UCLA in a heavily contested match-up that will invoke Pac-12 conference implications and national standings. The two schools hold decades of tension, passion and grit within their bouts. Saturday evening’s encounter will be no different. 
Before the battle of Los Angeles at Galen Center this weekend, here’s a review of some memorable games between the two rivals. 
March 12, 2015:Bruin Isaac Hamilton finishes season triple against USC in Pac-12 Quarterfinals.
Before the 2015 Pac-12 tournament encounter, UCLA had shown dominance against their rivals. Not only did the Bruins beat the Trojans in the two conference encounters beforehand, the Bruins clinched their sixth consecutive victory over USC.
UCLA sophomore guard Isaac Hamilton provided his career-high 36 points along with 4 assists, 2 steals on 7 of 9 shooting from beyond the arc and 13 of 17 from the field. The Bruins were deadly from the 3-point line, hitting 60% of their 3-pointers compared to the Trojans’ 36.4%. 
Former Bruin and current Los Angeles Clippers’ Norman Powell, contributed 14 points, 4 rebounds, 2 assists and a game-high 3 steals en route to a 96-70 UCLA victory. The senior guard subsequently declared for the draft in the offseason and was later drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks and played his first NBA season for the Toronto Raptors. 
March 13, 2009: 
DeMar DeRozan’s heroics lead USC’s semi-final victory en route to Pac-10 tournament. 
Despite losing their previous four rivalry matches, including two during the regular season, the Trojans had high hopes with their blooming star in freshman guard DeMar DeRozan. The stakes were extremely high, as both teams met on neutral ground at Staples Center vying for a spot in thePac-10 tournament final. 
Future NBA-star DeRozan provided an outpouring of 21 points, 13 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals on 7 of 12 shooting from the field. Fellow future NBA peer and 2008-09 Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year Taj Gibson notched 134 points, 113 rebounds and 23 assists to help the Trojans to a 65-55 victory, etching their way to the Pac-10 tournament title game. 
The Trojans subsequently continued their form for the rest of the season, as they eventually beat Arizona State to clinch the Pac-10 Tournament title. 
February 28, 2019: Overtime heartbreak at Pauley Pavillion. 
After beating the Bruins at home for their first encounter in the 2018-19 Pac-12 season, the Trojans headed to Westwood with confidence, looking to finish the season double.
After trailing the first-half 38-41, the Trojans rose back after the break with a 44-41 second-half performance that tied the game and forced overtime. Despite heroics from senior forward Bennie Boatwright, who posted 25 points, 15 rebounds and 6 assists on 7 of 17 shooting from beyond the arc, the Trojans fell short. A 3-point dagger from sophomore guard Jaylen Hands with 21 seconds left in overtime cemented UCLA’s victory over USC at Galen Center. 
Hands posted a double-double of his own with 21 points, 10 assists and 3 rebounds while going 7 of 17 from the field to lift the Bruins. 
February 25, 2004: Desmon Farmer hero in overtime win.
After successfully beating the Bruins in Westwood 76-69, the Trojans completed the double in an overtime thriller during senior Desmon Farmer’s last home game of his collegiate career. Farmer performed at a much-needed level to cement a victory and bolster his legacy at USC. 
Farmer posted 28 points, 3 assists and 3 rebounds to lead the Trojans throughout regulation time and overtime. A Farmer 3-pointer and lay-up during the dying minutes of overtime added to Farmer’s 9 points in the period and proved to be sufficient, as the Trojans narrowly beat UCLA by a 78-77 scoreline. 
After years of playing in the NBA, NBA G-League and professional teams across Europe and Latin America, Farmer returned to USC and is now director of scouting for men’s basketball. 
March 6, 2021:USC ties longest win streak against UCLA in nail-biter. 
USC’s recent victory over UCLA last March added to their current winning streak against their crosstown rivals, as they have now won four on the bounce. However, last year’s affair and scoreline hosted an intense and narrow victory for the Trojans. 
The Trojans started off poorly in the first half as they fell to a 25-36 deficit entering the break. Freshman forward Evan Mobley put up 13 points and 11 rebounds while shooting 6 of 10 from the field to offer a glimmer of hope to the away fans. Redshirt senior guard Tahj Eaddy ultimately provided the finishing touch, as he hit a corner three off of an inbound pass from sophomore guard Ethan Anderson to ice the game. 
The Trojans will look to replicate past games and continue their active win streak against UCLA Saturday at Galen Center.

USC will face crosstown rival UCLA at Galen Center Saturday. The 7 p.m. showdown will be the first meeting of the season between the teams, both in the scrum for Pac-12’s top spot. 
“I’m excited for the environment. I’m excited to come out with the win,” said junior guard Boogie Ellis in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
The Trojans have lost four of their last 11 games after starting with 13 straight victories. In their game against a 7-15 University of the Pacific team, USC found itself down 8 points at the end of the first half.
“We’ve got to be more consistent on offense,” Ellis said. “We’re going to have to be able to make those plays down the stretch.” 
Ellis’ 13 points and contributions from bench players freshman forward Harrison Hornery and freshman guard Reese Dixon-Waters led to a Trojan victory, albeit a close one. Hornery and Dixon-Waters finished with 9 points each. 
Ellis talked about using the disappointment of losing a close game to Arizona as a motivating factor for this weekend. 
“We didn’t play very good offensively, and we still had a chance to win the game,” Ellis said. “So that gives us more confidence going into UCLA.” 
The Trojans were without star junior forward Isaiah Mobley against Pacific, who was out with a non-displaced nose fracture that occurred in the Arizona game. Mobley leads USC in points, rebounds and steals and is likely to play this Saturday. His injury status is currently day-to-day. 
Redshirt senior forward Chevez Goodwin spoke of steps the team can take after the game against the Wildcats. 
“I think we just build off it, just knowing we can guard and defend anybody and play anywhere in the country,” Goodwin said. 
Goodwin had 12 points and 6 rebounds against Pacific. 
The Bruins, who are 17-4, have performed well this season, but are 1-2 in their last three games. UCLA, a 10-point favorite, dropped a game in triple-overtime to Arizona State. A few days before, they lost to Arizona on the road. 
With wins earlier this season over the Wildcats and Villanova, the Bruins have proved they can compete with some of the best teams in college basketball. Additionally, UCLA accomplished something USC wasn’t able to: beat Stanford. The Bruins swept the Cardinal, winning both games comfortably. 
UCLA guard Johnny Juzang will be a focal point for USC’s defense. The 6-foot-7 junior is a potential late first-round pick in the NBA draft and is averaging 18 points per game. With his size, Juzang can bully his way to the basket. With his accuracy, he is a threat from three. 
Junior guard Tyger Campbell is another strong 3-point shooter for the Bruins. Campbell shot 25% from behind the arc last season but is now shooting 40% from three. 
“[Campbell’s]  improved as a player,” Head Coach Andy Enfield said. “He’s had a great career at UCLA and he is one of the best point guards in our league.” 
Avoiding foul trouble will be key. Juzang, Campbell and senior guard Jules Bernard all shoot at or around 80% from the charity stripe. As a team, UCLA shoots 71.9% from behind the line, compared to USC’s 64.4%. 
“We have to defend like we’re capable of and try to defend without fouling,” Enfield said. 
The Trojans committed 23 personal fouls in their loss to the Wildcats. 
Offensively, USC has had difficulties with shot accuracy in recent games, shooting  30% and 34%, against Arizona State and the Wildcats.
While both teams have talented defenses, UCLA is also among the nation’s best. The Bruins hold opponents to 41.7% shooting from the field while giving up 65.9 points per game.
“UCLA’s an exceptional defense, and we just have to share the ball and make the right play,” Enfield said. 
The Pac-12 regular season is nearing its end. The path to the top overall seed in the Pac-12 Tournament is feasible for the Trojans but will require USC to win upcoming games against UCLA, Arizona, Oregon and Washington. 
“We have to try to win our home games against the better teams,” Enfield said. “UCLA and Arizona both come here in the next couple of weeks.”

Eighty-one thousand, six hundred fifty-nine dollars.
According to USC, this is the estimated cost of attendance for the 2021-2022 school year before financial aid. For eight four-credit courses, this comes to over $10,000 per course. This is already a steep cost, but for students of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, it comes with a surcharge — the language requirement.
For many students, the language requirement is no issue. Taking Advanced Placement language courses in high school or language competency exams fulfills this requirement. However, students who don’t have access to these options have additional obstacles before they even step foot on campus. 
Without the language requirement already fulfilled, students must earn a passing grade for three foreign language courses, stripping them of the opportunity to explore three other courses of their choosing and paying over $30,000 to satisfy this stipulation in their degree. While students can test into a higher level and potentially take one semester instead of three semesters, that is still the equivalent of $10,000.
Access to AP courses is a huge roadblock for many — as of 2015, 47.2% of rural school districts do not have students enrolled in AP classes, let alone language AP courses, as opposed to 2.6% of urban districts. Students from rural backgrounds are already more likely to be in disadvantaged situations as opposed to their urban counterparts, facing higher poverty rates, less internet access and less access to mental health care. Low-income schools and marginalized communities are not offered the same access to language courses compared to white, affluent schools. To expect all students to fulfill the language requirement with an uneven playing field sways overwhelmingly in the favor of students with greater access to the relevant resources and gives students who are already at a disadvantage one more hurdle to overcome.
Even multilingual students may not have their language requirement fulfilled — the USC language competency exams account for 40 languages, 21 of those being European languages, leaving those who speak languages outside of that list stuck with the requirement. 
As an alternative, USC accepts is the University of Pennsylvania language proficiency test which accounts for 46 languages, 11 being European. These language exams benefit a plurality of European language speakers, again putting mostly non-European speakers at a disadvantage. 
As a speaker of three non-English languages, two of them not being represented in either of the exams shows the narrowness of the USC language requirement and the requirement’s poor implementation.
While having another language at your disposal is an invaluable skill, potentially opening new worlds and opportunities for students, the way that Dornsife is managing language requirements does more harm than good. After completing the language courses, many students have little to no reason to maintain their knowledge of that language, especially if it is not associated with their occupation or study.
The Dornsife language requirement gives an upper hand to those who already benefit from better access to resources and widen the gap between them and those who already are behind. This arbitrary requirement,  stops students from exploring courses they want and delving deeper into fields they’re interested in, and worst of all, may be the difference between them getting a degree or not. 
Education is an avenue for students to discover what they love and to learn as much as they can about it, not to get bogged down by obligations that are not relevant to them. 
Although Dornsife is most known for this requirement, many other USC majors have the same language requirement for graduation. Language requirements are common throughout colleges in America and are intended to make students into global citizens, but a truly global university like USC must realize that mandatory language classes fail in this regard, only restricting their students. Instead, those extra class spaces could be used by a student to pursue their dreams and interests, so they can impact the world in the way they see fit.

Head Coach Andy Enfield likes to keep it real with his players after practice. Before the team heads downstairs to the weight rooms in Galen Center, he goes to graduate student guard Isaiah White to impart some wisdom.  
“Isaiah, the [fans don’t] understand that you guys have to go to class, go to practice and then you have to go lift weights.” 
White chimes in with a quick response. 
“Then I have to go change diapers.” 
After a long day of setting screens and hitting 3-pointers, White comes home to fatherly responsibilities such as diaper changing and singing lullabies. As if the workload of a D1 collegiate athlete wasn’t enough, White is also pursuing a master’s degree and above all, a father of two children. 
“The average fan just shows up, they cheer for you, but they don’t understand what it’s like, how time consuming it is to be a student athlete at this level, especially when you have a family,” Enfield said. “He’s one of my favorite players I’ve ever coached. He’s such a team player, and he’s been through a lot, so we’re here to support him with his off-the-court family situation.”  
The Balancing Act
White’s schedule is the ultimate test of time-management skills. 
  “I couldn’t even explain it,” White said. “Some days, it’s just going off of three hours of sleep trying to get a six-page paper done on game day. On some days, it’s easier than others. This has been the hardest year of my life as far as juggling everything and not quitting.”
But with the way he conducts his business on the court, you couldn’t tell White deals with sleep deprivation. 
“He’s a dog,” junior guard Boogie Ellis said. “He brings a lot of energy. I love playing with people like that. It makes me wanna play hard alongside him. He does all the little things, the dirty things that other players don’t wanna do. Every team needs a guy like him.” 
White has only started in two of his 20 appearances this season. He’s tasked with providing a spark off the bench, something his team has sorely needed. Against UC Berkeley on Jan. 29, White’s energy fueled a comeback after a slow start, and the Trojans went on to win 79-72.
“We were struggling, and he came in and provided a lot of energy defensively,” Enfield said. “He was all over the place, diving on the floor, getting through screens, [getting] rebounds. I thought he played a great game against Cal and helped us win the game.”
Journey to USC  
White possesses the hooper’s build, his 6-foot-7, 210 pound frame renders him equally imposing physically as he is agile. Despite his physique, White didn’t start playing organized basketball until his freshman year of high school. Already involved in football and baseball as well as Advanced Placement classes, he added on basketball after he saw his friends make the team, thinking he could do the same.
“I thought I was better than them in junior high, playing at lunchtime, so I tried out as well and made the team,” White said. “After that year, I decided I’m [only] gonna [go] wherever my heart’s at, whatever [sport] is the most fun. … [So I stuck with] basketball my 10th grade year.”
The road to becoming a Trojan was far from traditional. White didn’t gain traction as a recruit out of high school, opting instead to play basketball at Salt Lake Community College. After his freshman year, White decided to redshirt and later transferred to Utah Valley University. 
“Starting from JuCo, I’ve seen all the highs and the lows,” White said. “I was getting $175 stipend checks for a month at JuCo. Now, I’m in beautiful locker rooms, and I don’t take it for granted. I think all of it’s beautiful — JuCo, midmajor, here — I love it all.”
White never shied away from the grind, knowing he would come out a better person and player than before.
“I think my biggest ability is adapting to whatever situation is in front of me, just knowing that after winter comes spring,” White said. “You’re always gonna struggle in whatever you’re doing in life, but you’re always gonna get through it if you keep going … I’ve had bad years, I’ve had bad games, and I’ve learned to just keep playing because I love it and it’s fun to me. Once my good games and good years come around, it makes it all worth it..”
Enfield’s recruitment largely fueled the choice to transfer to USC, according to White. 
“I talked to coach, and he just kept it real with me,” White said. “I could hear it in his voice, his tone … He kept it real saying like, ‘I’m not gonna promise you nothing, no one gets promised anything over here. You gotta prove yourself.’ That’s all I wanted, the chance to come in here and prove myself. He made it very clear to me that I have to work for my spot.”
Earn your respect 
White slotted into last year’s USC team comfortably as a role player. Even as he played a crucial component to the team’s success, his contributions to the stats sheet were mostly modest. 
That was, until the Sweet Sixteen. 
Fresh off an upset of No. 2 Iowa, No. 7 seeded Oregon looked to spoil USC’s NCAA Tournament run. The Ducks jumped out to an early lead, leading with just over 12 minutes to play in the first half. All of the sudden, USC went on a run — scoring with every opportunity and getting stops on the defensive end — and didn’t look back. 
Looking at the box score after the game, it wasn’t either of the Mobley brothers, nor was it redshirt senior guard Tahj Eaddy at the top of the scoring. It was White. 
He wasn’t supposed to be the star of the team, but on that night in Indianapolis, White made it look like he was. The man who wasn’t known for stat-sheet stuffing finished with 22 points, 5 rebounds and 3 steals -—his best performance of the season.
“I feel like the team feeds off my energy,” White said after the game. “I make sure out the gate that I come with that energy and come with that heart, and hopefully it makes everyone else comfortable, and then we just get to playing our game.”
Enfield’s USC program has become a perennial title contender in the Pac-12 — pulling in high-level recruiting talent and developing players into stars — but the impact of role players is not lost on him. White acknowledged Enfield’s role in teaching him his own value.
“He’s shed light on what I bring to the table as a player,” White said. “A lot of times the dogs or the glue guys don’t get a lot of credit. The energy guys get looked over because they do things in the game that sometimes won’t show up on the stat sheet.”
Stay the course
From an early age, White understood the balance between being a student and an athlete. 
“It’s the way I’ve played my whole life in any sport is always at least play hard,” White said. “My parents didn’t care if I was doing well or not, whether it was in the classroom or on the court or on the field, they just wanted me to give it 100%. That’s all I do, and it’s been working for me.”
The last offseason presented a massive decision for White. Although the NCAA granted athletes an extra year of eligibility due to the coronavirus pandemic, White seriously considered ending his collegiate career with his second child on the way.
“I knew that I had my son coming right before the season, and I felt those challenges when my daughter was here last year,” White said. “I was like, ‘Man, I’m not doing that again.’ But I looked at myself from my dad’s point of view, and I looked at it like, ‘What would I want my son to do?’ I would want my son to get his master’s degree if he could, a free master’s degree. That was a priority, getting my degree here and having fun, and everything else will fall into place.”
For White, it’s easy to get wrapped up in the many hardships and intricacies of his life. He credits his family for grounding him.
“This game is where my passion is at. I love it so much sometimes I can get lost in it,” White said. “And they helped me to realize that there’s more things that are more important than the game of basketball, even though I love it so much. They bring me back to earth whether I’m going through a high or low. They make me pretty even keel and make me recognize what’s important in life.”

A Valentine’s Day kiss is probably on everyone’s manifestation list this week. But here’s the thing, you’ve got to put in work if you want that dream to come true. A little effort goes a long way, and Valentine’s Day is definitely the day to step up to the plate. Yes, we all know it’s a commercialized holiday and fake but these days, what isn’t? If we really look at the day, it’s just 24 hours to make the people in your life feel extra special — that’s something we can all get behind. 
Now, not everyone is a planner and the day is approaching fast, so let’s assess our options. When you think about it, Los Angeles is a city made for this day. Let California’s clear skies be the perfect Hollywood backdrop for your magical movie-worthy kiss. Here are the best date night ideas that will be sure to give your partner butterflies. 
Sunrise Hike
If your relationship is just blooming, a morning hike may be the perfect date. You’ll have the opportunity to talk while getting a breath of fresh air away from campus. In L.A. the sunrise usually happens around 6:45 am. It’s an early wake-up call but the extra effort may set the perfect tone for your relationship going forward. A beautiful sunrise will show your partner you’re ready for a new start with them. The Runyon Canyon Loop is about 3 miles and the trail summit offers a view of L.A. you won’t want to miss by oversleeping. 
Now, this is a popular spot (for a reason) so if you’re looking for something a little less crowded and willing to drive farther, Malibu Creek State Park will provide a true city escape. A first kiss in Malibu will be something you both won’t forget. 
A Home-Cooked Meal
Being away from your family is hard and this day of love might stir up some homesickness. However, there’s nothing like a home-cooked meal to heal a distant heart. Show your partner your feelings by taking the time to cook their favorite meal or something new you think they may enjoy. Regardless of cooking skills, the effort will be noticed. An easy pasta dish will say more than you think, even if it’s just heart-shaped pasta from Trader Joe’s.
Afternoon Museum Visit
Looking to show your crush it’s time to get serious? A museum visit will show your mature side. Don’t be afraid to voice your artistic critiques as you walk through the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The right person will want to hear your artistic thoughts and bring their own to the conversation. 
If this date sounds too serious, get goofy and imitate some of the weird sculptural poses you’ll be sure to see in any art museum. Make it your goal to make your partner laugh so loud that a museum employee shushes you. 
A Night at the Griffith Observatory 
Count the stars reflected in your partner’s eyes at the Griffith Observatory. Though closed on Mondays, a Valentine’s Day weekend date will be just as magical. The dazzling views of the L.A. sky will take your breath away (just make sure to compliment your date’s smile more). 
If they’re not from L.A., the view of the Hollywood sign will definitely peak their attention. Griffith Observatory is open until 10 p.m., so this date should feel anything but rushed. Take your time and wait for the perfect moment to lean in close.   
Play Hooky at Disneyland 
A Disneyland Valentine’s Day adventure is definitely a splurge, but it’ll be worth it when you see your partner’s face lit up by fireworks. If you’re looking for a magical day, no one does it better than Disney. You’ll laugh in line, clutch each other on rides and fight over who gets the last bite of each delicious Disneyland treat. 
Talk about the future with your partner while strolling through Tomorrowland and dream about where you two want to settle down while exploring Frontierland.
If you find yourself without a crush on Valentine’s Day, go grab your best friend and hit any of these spots instead; you’ll find that the day of love doesn’t have to be so exclusionary after all. Otherwise, seize the day and create your perfect end-of-movie kiss scene. The best part is the credits won’t kick you off the screen.

I guess you could say that love is in the air. 
Rihanna nearly broke the internet when she debuted her baby bump on a walk in Harlem with A$AP Rocky. Lana Condor and her boyfriend just announced their engagement (So, I guess that means she is no longer sending out letters à la Lara Jean Covey?). Of course, that must also mean it is that much-dreaded season. That day drenched in cheap red and pink decor when you wear your SO’s jacket during the cool night of February 14th or you end up scream-singing Olivia Rodrigo and Taylor Swift in your bedroom thinking back upon all of your exes. So, are we singing “Deja Vu” or “Better Man”? 
It would be easy to assume that I would write column about romance books, right? I mean, I’m clearly in love with written romance, and ‘tis the season? Well, I figured that those in a relationship think their own to be so perfect that they wouldn’t want to read a crude imitation of date night in fiction form. Not to mention that those looking for love might be too frustrated to even consider picking up a paperback about romance. So no, instead I’m going to do this piece on my first literary love: history. 
Many times people ask why I am a history major. After all, here I am doing a column that is literally all about books. Surely, I would want to spend my university years making my way through Jane Austen’s collection instead of analyzing Shirley Chisholm’s presidential campaign.
Well, here is what most people fail to understand. History is basically a book itself (I’ve also compared it to a reality television show, but I digress). You have characters, setting, falling action and rising action. The coolest part? History is all real. These were human beings making the same mistakes that we do and can build upon. Yeah, history can be a bummer sometimes, but that’s the beauty of being semi-adults: You get to choose the history you read.
I like a story that I can settle into and meet the character like an old friend. As if I were learning their life story over a cup of coffee. Nowhere is it clearer than in the superstar, blockbuster book titled “The Dutch House” by Ann Patchett, owner of the Nashville, Tenn. bookstore  Parnassus Books. I was lucky because I listened to the audiobook, which none other than Tom Hanks’ narrated. Patchett’s book takes us through our main character Danny and his sister Maeve’s expulsion from their home – the titular Dutch house – and how their lives evolved from there. The reader ends up feeling like they are living these experiences with Danny and Maeve, or as if they are hearing this heartbreaking, fairytale-esque story spill out of Tom Hanks – I mean Danny. They feel human. It’s an exploration of family and heartbreak and protectiveness. And I think I need to re-read it immediately. 
Honestly, with books that I need to re-read right now, I think of “The Smell of Other People’s Houses” by Bonnie-Sue Hitchcock. Even though my history specialties are women in American history and Jewish American history, there are still massive gaps in my knowledge (You can’t get every single question on Jeopardy, after all). 
One of the main gaps is Alaska. Alaska is a fairly recent addition to the United States, and there was a massive fight to preserve the culture of indigenous Alaskans. What spurred my interest in that? Bonnie-Sue Hitchcock’s book. “The Smell of Other People’s Houses” deals with Alaska in the 1970s, but it goes into great detail about the fight against statehood in the 1950s. Hitchcock interweaves four teenagers stories (Ruth, Dora, Alyce and Hank) into this Alaskan landscape; she writes so beautifully I felt the chill on my cheeks and was just about five seconds from booking a flight to Anchorage. It’s better to go into this one knowing little, so just pick it up. 
Here’s the thing about history: There is so much of it. I haven’t learned every single thing about history at USC, nor did I really expect to, because we have seven continents and people have made discoveries on each one. There have been wars, and people are going about their day-to-day life. 
As you might imagine, I can’t fit every single diverse experience in this column and you can’t learn all of history (that’s why we have specialties!). 
There is so much in historical fiction and historical literature beyond the wars. 
Read Jamaica Kincaid and Toni Morrison or Chaim Potok and Emma Lazarus. Read Julia Alvarez and Gabriel García Márquez. Read Celeste Ng and Michelle Zauner’s fantastic memoir and read Louise Erdrich and Tommy Orange. Read American authors and read beyond the U.S. 
There is so much out there to learn, it’s dizzying, and there is so much that we don’t know simply because it’s lost: a dead language, the 18-and-a-half minutes of the Watergate tapes or the Library of Alexandria. 
My love for history started with learning about the Presidents’ lives (did you know that John Quincy Adams went skinny-dipping in the Potomac?) through books that looked at them one by one in caricature-like drawings. Now I consider myself an expert on revolutionary women in the summer of 1781 and the labyrinth of my family’s history. 
History is like a tree; you climb from branch to branch, and the best and most scary part about it all is there is always more to learn. So many preconceived notions to break down. So, if you don’t like the film that your S.O. is watching this Valentine’s day, or if you have exhausted your Taylor Swift playlist (though really, how could you?), pick up a historical book.

Jon Favreau’s “The Book of Boba Fett” is the second addition to Disney+’s Star Wars universe surrounding the Mandalorian (Pedro Pascal). Since Boba Fett’s (Temuera Morrison) surprising, but expected, entrance in “The Mandalorian” season two and the announcement of his own TV series, the return of the fan-favorite bounty hunter turned out bittersweet in the end.
TBOBF’s finale, which premiered Feb. 9, delivers the interaction between characters and adaptations from other Star Wars content that fans only dreamt of watching. In the finale, Boba Fett fights in an all-out war against the Pyke syndicate to keep the planet away from the Spice, a drug in the Star Wars universe. 
But he is not alone in this fight.
With the help from Black Krrsantan (Carey Jones), the Mandalorian, Fennec Shand (Ming-Na Wen) and the people of Tatooine, Boba Fett builds an army to defend the planet against the Pykes and his enemy. But, in trying to appease fans, the finale focuses too much on character interactions and diverts away from Boba Fett’s story.
Although TBOBF’s ending detracts from Boba Fett, the first four episodes uncover what happened to Boba Fett after his appearance in “Star Wars: Episode 6 – The Return of the Jedi” (1983) through a series of flashbacks and forwards. The episodes explain how Boba Fett redefined his identity and the intention behind his goal to protect the city as a Daimyo of Tatooine.
While the first four episodes of the series highlighted the bounty hunter’s character, history and objective, the last three hardly seem like a tale of Boba Fett. Rather, the later episodes focus more on Jon Favreau’s original character, the Mandalorian. 
Many viewers expected the Mandalorian to make his guest appearance in TBOBF after his theme played at the end of episode four. However, the Mandalorian monopolized significant screen time in TBOBF, having the entirety of episode five to himself and the majority of episode six dedicated to his story.
For that reason, viewers expected to see more of Boba Fett in the season finale, which did happen, but it was surprising to see the focus still on the Mandalorian as he attempted to save the city against another danger while Boba was unavailable. 
Even as Boba Fett makes a strong impression during his confrontation with one of his oldest foes, the Mandalorian’s action and story ultimately distracts the viewers. 
While TBOBF is a tale of Boba Fett, the supporting characters take too much of the viewers’ attention. The finale compares to the finale of “The Mandalorian” season two when the showrunners introduced a key character in Star Wars, while keeping the focus on the Mandalorian.
But that does not mean that all of TBOBF is bitter or anticlimatic. 
The finale’s fight scenes against the Pyke syndicate do an excellent job of recentering Boba Fett as a main character. Director Robert Rodriguez’s flashy and almost child-playing-with-toys style of action sequences provides a treat to the audience’s eyes.
Flamboyant fight scenes aside, the expansion of the Mandalorian universe truly makes TBOBF incredible. TBOBF brings in new characters and ideas, such as modding, alongside existing elements like the Spice and crime organizations such as the Hutts and the Pykes. Even as the finale’s characters and components hints to its larger role in the Star Wars universe, the episode overall presented a bitter tale about Boba Fett as his spotlight was taken away by the Mandalorian. Nonetheless, “The Book of Boba Fett,” an exciting Star Wars story that plays well into the larger Star Wars universe, makes it a must watch for fans.
