About three weeks before Marin Dasic, a senior driver for the USC water polo team, made the over 12-hour trip from his hometown of Zagreb, Croatia to Los Angeles, he had doubts that he would ever board the plane. 
Last Wednesday, over three years later, Dasic had just finished an interview and was looking at photos from a recent water polo photoshoot. Upon seeing the results, he excitedly asked water polo Associate Sports Information Director Darcy Couch if it was possible to PhotoShop an “eight-pack” into his picture. 
When Dasic talks about how he grew to love his experience as a Trojan, that same humor and candor shines through. 
When he left Croatia, Dasic knew that he was leaving behind a culture that put water polo at the forefront. Because of this, his childhood and family life had always been impacted by the sport. 
“It is how I grew up,” Dasic said. “That’s what I did. My whole family and my whole love was dedicated [to] water polo.”
Given his lifelong ties to the sport, it’s understandably difficult for Dasic to choose the best moments in his water polo career. Still, one stood out, which he remembered with a smile.
“It’s my first goal ever for water polo. It was in practice. I was with older guys. Those guys were like two, three years older than me. I was playing with them. And [the] ball literally bounced in front of me, [in front] of the post, and I just, like, pushed it in,” Dasic said, laughing. “I was so happy. I still remember it.”
When he received a call years later from former head coach Jovan Vavic to talk about playing for USC, Dasic was already representing Croatia on the national stage. While he was drawn to an education in the United States, Dasic also received multiple offers to play professionally for European teams. In the end, he was most attracted to a USC coaching support system whose knowledge and love for the sport was matched only by his own.
“I think it was the coaches, I would say. I knew I wanted to play [for] someone who has a similar background [in] water polo as me,” Dasic said. “And I think there was no better combination than Jovan and [current head coach Marko Pintaric] to be a part of here in [the] U.S. I think that was my good chance to come here and continue playing good water polo, as I always wanted.”
Dasic described his freshman year as a steady improvement process, getting used to the team dynamic and the level of play that was expected of him. Judging by his performance in the pool, he adjusted quite well.  
That year, Dasic earned an All-MPSF Honorable Mention and NCAA All-Tournament Second Team honors while ranking fifth on the team with 30 goals scored.
“I think my freshman year was a great learning experience for me, and to see those older guys at the time,” Dasic said. “You know, right now and back then I would say [are] way different. The team chemistry is different. The guys are a little bit different. Not saying anything was bad back in the days — on [the] contrary, it was awesome. Everybody was working hard. I saw what USC is all about.”
When the time came to represent his team as an upperclassman, he wanted to make sure that the younger players felt comfortable working constructively with him, and he still has that mindset today. He noted that this aspect of the team’s dynamic is critical because, at the end of the day, he knows that everyone has the same goal in mind.
“If I’m messing up, [teammates] can tell me; [they] can feel appreciated and accepted. And so there’s no difference. You know, in the water, there is no difference,” Dasic said. “He’s [a] freshman, I’m [a] senior, that doesn’t matter. If you’re awesome, you’re going to play. If you get to work, you work your way up, and you earn your spot. Everybody’s valuable.”
That collaborative leadership proved effective in his junior year. He scored 35 goals, earned an All-American Honorable Mention, another All-MPSF Honorable Mention, received NCAA All-Tournament Second Team recognition and led USC to the 2018 NCAA Championship.
With his time at USC coming to a close at the end of this season, Dasic doesn’t see his personal goals shrinking — only expanding. After turning down the opportunity to join the Croatian team in the Olympics before his freshman year at USC, he is excited to begin that process again. 
“I want to start all over again, earn my spot and show everyone that I can still play and hopefully go to the Olympics one day,” Dasic said with a grin. “It’s on me to work, to improve, to believe and go to practice every single day, you know, until I reach my goal.” 
Going back to Croatia doesn’t just mean focusing on water polo: He gets to see his family once again. He remembered how as he contemplated Vavic’s offer his family supported him to pursue not only a USC education, but a college experience.
“At that time, they said, ‘We think you can do [it] … you should do this,” Dasic recalled. “If you don’t like it, you can always come back home, you always have a place to come back to, you know, you’re not going to lose much. If you don’t like it, come back. If you love it, you have a great degree, you did not lose anything.’ And here I am, graduating in December.”
With 28 goals so far this season, Dasic will be a key player to watch as he and the rest of his Trojans enter the latter half of their season with hopes of defending their NCAA Championship title.

I wrote this column twice. 
There was the initial version I wrote at halftime, in which I absolutely pounded USC for what I thought would be an embarrassing loss to No. 9 Notre Dame. I laid into the entire program for putting forth another embarrassing effort where everything went wrong, and I used the referee mistakenly calling a USC penalty on “UCLA” as evidence that the Trojans had no identity, no respect, no path back to prominence.
And then there’s this version, which comes after I saw the Trojans nearly come back and beat the Irish in South Bend before falling 30-27. 
Though USC ended within a field goal of Notre Dame, this is a much more annoying column to write. Did that feeling come because I wrote nearly 500 words for nothing? Of course; that annoys any journalist. I was also pretty happy with how I had written that version and was looking forward to seeing how a fanbase prone to constant complaining would react.
But mostly, I was frustrated with myself, because I have no goddamn idea what to make of this team anymore. As soon as I think I have a beat on who the 2019 Trojans are, they do something that completely changes my opinion. It’s maddening.
I entered Saturday night’s game believing this team had two undeniable strengths: the receiving corps and the interior defensive line. The receivers, led by senior Michael Pittman Jr., entered as the team’s best unit but combined for just 59 yards at halftime. The interior defensive linemen — including massive redshirt sophomore defensive tackles Jay Tufele and Marlon Tuipulotu — performed well all season against the run until Notre Dame senior running back Tony Jones Jr. gashed them for 176 yards, many of which came up the middle.
By the time Notre Dame kicked a field goal on its first second-half possession, USC was down 20-3 and looked dead in the water. And you know what? I was fine with that. I knew there was a chance that the Trojans would come into Notre Dame Stadium and get repeatedly punched in the mouth, similar to 2017’s demoralizing 49-14 defeat. What I was not prepared for, however, was USC looking like a completely different team from that point on.
Suddenly, the receivers were getting open, and freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis had more time to find them. Redshirt freshman tailback Markese Stepp was getting the carries that many fans felt he deserved, and he delivered with 82 yards and a touchdown on 10 attempts, repeatedly bowling through or dragging Notre Dame defenders. The defensive backs were able to stick with their men, and the entire second level improved on pursuing ball-carriers and pulling them down before they could reach the sticks.
That’s not to say it was perfect, but USC’s 24-10 scoring run over the final 12 minutes begs the question: Why couldn’t the Trojans do this all game long? Why can’t they maintain this level of performance throughout the season?
If the Trojans were just bad, that would be one thing. It would be depressing for the fan base to watch an Oregon State-caliber team suck every week, and I’m not saying that would be a better option. But there’s something particularly infuriating about following a team that at times seems on the cusp of putting it all together and at others appears unsure how to play football. And the worst part is that no one seems to know what the missing piece is.
We’ve already established that I have no clue how to unlock this team’s considerable potential. Head coach Clay Helton has proven he’s not the man to lead the program back to the mountaintop. Offensive coordinator Graham Harrell has certainly improved upon last year’s play-calling, but he’s also been without answers when faced with opposing game plans from tough defensive teams like Washington and Notre Dame.
But as much as things change with this program, they also stay the same. The pass rush was again abysmal, both in pressuring senior quarterback Ian Book and in finishing tackles on the rare occasions it had a shot at him. And once again, the special teams proved its incompetence, misplaying several excellent punts that could have been downed inside the Irish 10-yard line.
Maybe this is more straightforward than I’m making it out to be. Maybe USC just needs to find a head coach who will emphasize consistency and discipline. With all the talent this program has, even with its recruiting issues lately, that could be all it needs to return to its rightful place among the blue bloods.
Or maybe I’m overreacting to one game. Notre Dame is a really good team capable of making other good teams look discombobulated. There’s no shame in losing by 3 points to the Irish in South Bend, no matter what Trojan fans tell you.
But that’s not how it feels right now. When you lack not only answers but any idea of how to find those answers, it’s almost worse than feeling like there’s no solution at all. And if I, a student journalist who doesn’t really have anything riding on this team, feel that way, I can only imagine how Helton and the rest of the USC football program feel.

California’s homelessness problem is receiving federal attention. Two weeks ago, President Donald Trump sent multiple administrative officials to Los Angeles  to assess the city’s homelessness crisis and earlier this week, L.A. City Councilman Joe Busciana asked Gov. Gavin Newsom to declare a state of emergency on homelessness. 
While federal and local leaders have been debating solutions and devising policy recommendations, USC’s own Homelessness Initiative has been actively working to address the issue in the surrounding university community. 
The USC Initiative to End Homelessness launched in spring 2016 as part of Provost Michael Quick’s university-wide plan to tackle “wicked problems,” or challenges in the 21st century. 
Brenda Wiewel, director of the initiative, was appointed by Quick at the initiative’s launch. The program aims to develop a way in which USC could contribute to the government, non-profit and business worlds in order to eliminate homelessness at a local level.  
Wiewel, who works with a steering committee comprising 12 USC deans, believes that federal attention on the issue will be beneficial, even though the differing perspectives voiced from the White House might fail to address homelessness in a constructive way. 
“I felt like the focus that [the president] wanted to do was to criminalize the people who are homeless, and in essence get the police involved,” Wiewel said. “What they end up doing is just filling the jails with people who are homeless, and it isn’t effective.”
In early June, L.A. city officials reported that homelessness in the county, which counts the number of people living on the streets, in vehicles and in shelters, increased by 12%. The same report found that within the city, the number of homeless individuals increased to more than 36,000, a 16% increase from 2018.
While this number increased in the past year, Wiewel said she hopes to ensure that the University remains a source of problem solving during this crisis. She said that at first, the initiative faced challenges regarding the services the University would be able to provide. However, she emphasized the importance of a united community and interdisciplinary collaboration to find solutions to homelessness. 
Over the past academic year, the initiative had over 1,500 student volunteers, who completed over 132,000 hours of service. This year, the initiative is also encouraging students to work on the research team, led by the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, starting in December as part of its annual effort with the L.A. homelessness count. 
“USC began to look at [the issue] and say maybe we can help,”  Wiewel said. “We have a lot of resources here, how can we use our resources, how can we partner, collaborate, come together and be a part of the solution because [the USC community] is not an island … we have some responsibility to help.”
Alec Vandenberg, a senior majoring in public policy, has been actively engaged in tackling the issue of homelessness at the University, focusing primarily on USC students who face food insecurity. While Vandenberg believes that homelessness in the city is a dire issue that needs to be addressed, he said Trump has yet to take action on the issue.
“A lot of people agree that there’s a housing shortage, there’s a housing affordability issue and all that ties in together, and there’s got to be a lot of tools in the toolbox to deal with that,” Vandenberg said. “But if the federal government is serious about tackling homelessness and housing security, we know the resources it’s going to take, we know what policies and programs work. It’s ultimately putting the money where your mouth is.”
This year, Wiewel hopes to develop more meaningful relationships with the L.A. community. She also hopes that the leadership of Carol Folt as USC president will help expand the initiative’s efforts. 
“The deans are still in place, and they still care, and each of the schools are doing interesting things,” Wiewel said. “But, I have a feeling that because [Folt] really wants to see [USC] be a partner in the community and contribute, this is such a perfect opportunity because we have already established a foundation for it, and we have a lot of expertise and a lot of interest from students.”
Max Prosser, a sophomore majoring in dance, said while he has heard of the initiative, he believes that increased engagement on campus would encourage students to become more involved.
“I don’t know a whole lot about it … but I feel like [the issue of homelessness] is important, and we need to do more about it,” Prosser said. “I should be better, and I feel like I should get more involved with it.”
Wiewel said the ultimate goal is to make sure that each student is fully aware of the issue and can find some way to address it, no matter what field they are studying. 
“The vision is that anyone that graduates from USC should have an educated view on why there is homelessness, who people are that are homeless,” Wiewel said. “They shouldn’t be the ones frightened or stigmatizing or stereotyping, we would want them to understand the complexities, to have compassion, and to find some way to make a contribution.”
The Initiative has partnered with many resources such as the Trojan Food Pantry, located at Parkside Apartments. The pantry, which was established in 2018, was created to address the needs of students who might be facing homelessness and food insecurity. 
Along with creating on campus resources, the initiative has been successful in launching outreach programs. A new program with the Keck School of Medicine and the Los Angeles County Hospital was developed to address the medical needs of homeless people. The program, called the Street Medicine Institute, trains health care providers in treating those on the streets and develops a way of helping homeless individuals who were admitted into hospitals.
Wiewel emphasized the importance of active engagement from the USC community, whether they are educated on the issue or not. She said community members across the University can help in the initiative’s efforts.
“We need a group of people who are at a place where they can really understand [the issue] at a much more sophisticated level,” Wiewel said. “To be able to actually use their knowledge and intelligence to help solve it.”
The initiative has also encouraged students to engage in problem solving in the classroom, partnering with the School of Architecture to challenge students to create affordable and implementable housing projects. 
The initiative plans to host many events this year, beginning with a homelessness awareness week in November. The committee planning the event meets every Monday, and Vandenberg said that more engagement and conversation about the issue among students will allow more people to access resources.
“The more people are talking about the issue really helps in terms of decreasing stigma and proliferating resources and breaking down this barrier so that more people can access the resources,” Vandenberg said. “Homelessness and hunger are real on every college campus, especially [at USC], despite the inceptions of what students go here.”

Delegates from the National Association for College Admission Counseling voted in late September to revise elements of their ethics code to allow incentives for recruiting early decision applicants, transfer students and students after the May 1 National College Decision Day deadline. 
Previously, the association barred colleges from offering incentives, such as improved financial aid or special housing packages, to early decision applicants. Additionally, the new rules will allow colleges to recruit students after a deposit has been submitted to another institution and solicit transfer applications from previous applicants regardless of whether that student inquired about transferring — both of which were previously prohibited. 
The conference comes two years after the Department of Justice began an investigation into whether NACAC’s Codes of Ethics and Professional Practice violated antitrust laws. The Justice Department argued that rules restricting recruitment practices reduced competition among colleges, which may lower the cost for students. 
On Sept. 28, NACAC voted 211 to 3 in favor of revising the policies.
Rossier School of Education adjunct professor Robert Massa said the new policies apply business and for-profit principles to the not-for-profit world of education. 
Massa, who attended the conference, said that initial changes likely won’t be felt immediately at USC and other large, selective institutions across the country. 
“I think to start out, initially, [the regulatory changes] will have a minimal impact,” Massa said. “Because admissions officers know that it’s the right thing to do not to entice students to apply to their institution early based on an incentive.”
But, according to Eric Hoover, senior writer at the Chronicle of Higher Education and an expert on college admissions, the changes may bring more “uncertainty” to different aspects of higher education.
“Because colleges now are free to pursue students who’ve committed elsewhere after the May 1 deposit deadline, financial aid offers could keep flying all summer long,” Hoover wrote in the Chronicle. “Poaching another institution’s students while devising ways to protect your own could become a familiar exercise for many enrollment leaders.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the Office of Admissions said it was monitoring NACAC code changes. 
“We are reviewing in detail the changes that the National Association of College Admissions Counseling made to its Code of Ethics and Professional Practices,” the statement read.
 Steve Desir, a doctoral candidate in Rossier who attended the conference, said that he also believes that impacts on USC’s admission processes would be limited. However, Desir said how USC chooses to apply these changes “is more a question about who USC wants to be” from a values standpoint.
Though existing concerns include institutions using the ethics code to justify “poaching” students from other schools, Massa hopes that USC will refrain from poaching.
Massa explained that smaller, less selective institutions will likely feel the effects of these regulatory adjustments. But with more time, he believes the admissions process will see more “cutthroat competition.”
“The USCs of the world are not exempt from this,” Massa said. 
USC’s involvement in the Operation Varsity Blues FBI investigation this year may serve as an important context to how these changes may impact admissions. However, Massa said that the Justice Department’s investigation was initiated separately from the admissions scandal.
“While USC might not be implicated by the changes to the code of ethics, I think the conversation around fairness, affordability and inclusion — given the scandal that we just had in the past year — it’s really a space that USC should be engaged in,” Desir said.
Though unrelated, the two investigations do share common ground related to public distrust of college admissions.
“All of us are concerned about the lack of trust in the college admissions process,” Massa said. “So from that perspective, Varsity Blues is a symptom of that lack of trust.”
According to Desir, USC’s place in the discussion concerning admissions ethics is especially relevant given the visibility of the University’s admissions processes over the course of the past year. 
“I think there’s a real opportunity with these changes to the code of ethics. The conversations happening in the field [allow] for us to be as bold as we were then about thinking about who is a USC student and how do we provide leadership in this space that is grappling with these really challenging questions,” he said.

Between hours of classes and cadet training, sophomore aerospace engineering major Natalie Smith heads to the first floor of the Physical Education Building to strap on a pair of virtual reality goggles. But Smith, a cadet in the Air Force ROTC, isn’t playing a video game — she’s training to fly a plane.
Since April, USC is the first and only college to offer the optional program based off of the Pilot Next Training the Air Force uses, which uses immersive training devices to teach cadets basic piloting skills that prepare them to fly before they step foot in a plane.  
Smith believes the new VR simulation program has been beneficial for student cadets who hope to fly within the Air Force. Though she was able to practice flying a real, small plane over the summer, she said the new program gives students the opportunity to practice with the simulation.
“Within the detachment, it’s very cool to have that integration with some actual flying, and it is something that I am very passionate about and the main reason why I am in this program as a whole,” Smith said. “It is also productive in the way that you’re learning, and it’s more hands-on learning  than doing all the academic parts of the mechanics of flying.” 
Lt. Cols. Olivia Nelson and Reid Wynans, who teach the aerospace studies courses, partnered with the VR program’s creators to pilot it at USC. The first graduates of the program completed their training at the Armed Forces Reserve Center in Austin, Texas. Wynans said using VR simulations will help cadets gain the skills and confidence they need to perform well at Air Force pilot training in the future.  
Through VR simulations, cadets learn the basic controls for the T-6 Texan II, a training aircraft used in the Air Force, which gives them a better understanding of aircraft functions and system controls.
Cadets can volunteer to participate in the training and complete it on their schedules. Sean Liew, a cadet vice wing commander in the program and a senior majoring in international relations, said it helps cadets save time.
“It’s a lot of convenience in economics and saving time but also it’s in the comfort of the university where you can go to class, come here,fly for an hour, go home, go to the gym and come back right again,” Liew said. “The accessibility is a big part.”  
Wynans said the program encourages students to learn flying skills early without consequences since their performance isn’t graded. 
“They can begin to familiarize themselves early on and start that learning with regard to, in this case, becoming a pilot in their collegiate career, so that when they go to the Air Force’s pilot training, they already have so many of those competencies in both flying skills and the knowledge and frankly the habits of mind to be able to… have the confidence to search those ambiguous environments, make sense of those ambiguous environments, learn from it and thrive in that training environment,” Wynans said.  
As the program continues, Liew said AFROTC officials will monitor how students balance the program with their course load and mandatory trainings. 
“We are asking them to tackle on a lot more, and  juggle the problem of having [student cadets] excel in their academics and their ROTC tasks, but also to add on this extra program and really seeing how these students can take it and how they can manage their time with how much time they’re spending in the program,” Liew said. 
The future of the program is still being determined, but Wynans said he hopes the program will continue because it helps cadets learn from various instructors and peers, just like they will at Air Force training. Smith encourages students to take advantage of the training because it will help them adjust to learning skills on a real plane.  
“Since a lot of the flying is muscle memory and instinct, you start to develop that earlier on, and have been exposed to all of this information before, to not only benefit yourself but help your teammates around you,” she said.

When Catalina Acebal-Acevedo first came to USC as an undergraduate student, she was disappointed there was no organization on campus catered toward students with interests aligned with reading and writing. 
“Even though freshman year freshman orientation and was meeting a bunch of people from across the globe, I still didn’t feel like I had found that kind of creative community that I was craving,” said Acebal, now a fifth-year student working toward completing a progressive degree in literary editing and publishing. “I would have classes in the English department, but after class people would disperse a bit, and it was hard to find a place to meet and workshop or talk about books.” 
Last year, Acebal and a group of friends went on a mission to cultivate a community of readers and writers on campus. Last spring, the group officially founded the USC Literary Society, the first student organization centered on the creation and sharing of literary art. The society gives students a chance to connect outside of a classroom setting and provides the tools needed to build a support system in the creative community.  
The club’s main focus falls on hosting creative workshops, which create a safe place for students to share their creative work and receive advice and feedback from their peers. At the workshops, members invite poets, fiction writers, screenwriters and more in the literary field to come and read their work to the community. They emphasize that workshops are not limited to a single genre of writing and can be organized for any kind of literary creation. 
For Acebal, workshops provide opportunities for her to develop her songwriting skills with the advice and support of her fellow club members. 
“I want to teach a songwriting workshop because I play guitar,” Acebal said. “There’s a guy who is a screenwriter who wants to teach a screenwriting workshop. The club really caters itself to whatever people want in a given semester.” 
Acebal said that since the workshops are completely student-led, writers have the opportunity to advance their craft without the pressures of the classroom. According to Acebal, everyone is there to build each other up and help students become the best writers they can be. 
The club also hosts events so that writers can get a glimpse of the publishing process. Vice President of Professional Programming Annabel Smith is in charge of organizing special lectures by USC professors who have experience in the publishing world. The lectures are meant to prepare members who are interested in publishing their own creative work. 
“Creative writing is such a vague thing sometimes,” Acebal said. “Unlike something like architecture or pre-med, you don’t have a set track and that can be hard to feel like you’re floating around and you don’t have any direction. So just to hear from people who have made it and who have done all the things you want to do is really valuable.”
In addition, the society organizes other events such as book club meetings and kickbacks for members to get to know each other. Book club meetings invite interested members to join in discussing a novel read by the whole community. For instance, after fall break, the club will be joining to discuss “Slow Days, Fast Company” by Eve Babitz. Kickbacks provide a casual setting for members to gather, grab a bite to eat and enjoy the company of fellow readers and writers.
The society is open to students of all majors with a passion for reading and writing, said Smith. Even students who have little creative writing experience can join because of the intro level workshops offered.
“You don’t have to be an incredible poet already,” said Smith, a senior majoring in communication. “You can just come and learn. We are all new to it. Everyone has their own voice and everyone is in the process of discovering that voice.” 
Sara Sturek, a sophomore majoring in communication and creative writing, said she was inspired by the society to change her course of education and pursue her passion for poetry.  
 “[The] Literary Society made me realize many people here do want to be writers and it can be a viable career,” Sturek said. “I had never considered that. It was always something I did on the side.”
Expansion plans for the society include developing an official website within the next few weeks which will serve as a place for members to sign up for workshops and stay updated on club events.

October is the cruelest month. 
Halloween casts a shadow over October, and our festivities are so strange. We prop up ghouls, demons and monsters on our doorsteps, pin them to our walls and dress our bodies like them. Halloween can bring out the creativity and strangeness in people. 
For me, the entire month is cruel because I am, to put it quaintly, a known scaredy-cat. 
Now I’m not scared of clowns, monsters, zombies or ghosts (I don’t mess with demons though); rather, I’m petrified of what usually precedes their appearance: a dark atmosphere, eerie (or no) music, slight creaks in the floorboards and a whole lot of dry ice. 
The worst part about horror movies for me is the anxiety of anticipation. And every channel I flip and every theater I go to during October tries to lure me into their terror trap.
In our sometimes-dull existence, a scary movie here and there is nice; if that movie can excite us in some way, even better! That’s why scary movies hold such a dear place in our culture. Think about that friend that likes scary movies — don’t they love scary movies? It’s something people can easily be passionate about, but it’s a bridge I have yet to cross. 
There are mildly scary movies that still, albeit barely, cross the threshold to be considered “horror” by most. I think of these more as “spooky” movies; arguably the best example of this is a film I rewatched over the weekend: “The Silence of the Lambs.”
The Jonathan Demme-directed movie is a perfect exercise in building anticipation. We follow budding FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) as she periodically interrogates the noted serial killer/cannibal Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Lecter promises Starling and the entire FBI clues to capture the at-large killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), but, of course, this deal isn’t as simple as it looks on paper. 
“Lambs” is very restrained for a scary movie. It barely shows any acts of violence — it’s just that the dominant atmosphere is really, really dark. If you’re Clarice (who the movie wants you to identify with as conveyed through camera movement and position), on one side of you there’s a cannibal, on the other you have a guy who kidnaps women and skins them … not much room for so much as a smile in that scenario.
Just like Clarice, we’re suffocated by evil on all sides, waiting for it to strike. 
The film doesn’t show us pictures of Lecter’s past victims though they are described in detail — Demme wants us to picture them, he taunts us and challenges us to come up with the most gruesome images we can. That is, until we see Lecter unleashed. 
The movie’s most violent moment is its most satisfying moment. Not because we want to see (spoiler alert) two cops get eaten alive — it’s because we’ve been wanting to see Lecter let loose. For someone easily prone to scary-movie anxiety like myself, this scene was sheer torture. I kept pausing and taking deep breaths and walking away from my computer, I couldn’t do it. How effective does a movie have to be to get that reaction? 
“The Silence of the Lambs” is a masterful exercise in spookiness. It’s an essential Halloween film even if it isn’t ghoulishly freaky. It is confident that you, the viewer, are capable of imagining such horrendous acts of violence that it doesn’t even have to match what’s in the darkest recesses of your mind. 
October is the cruelest month, but it brings back some damn good movies.

“Time and Place: Here and now, in our collective consciousness.”
This statement is boldly written in the playbill of the School of Dramatic Arts’ latest production, “Amsterdam.” Though this short declaration is meant to contextualize the show’s setting, it also accurately promotes the post-modernist critical approach and vision of director Lilach Dekel-Avneri. 
“Amsterdam” was originally written by Maya Arad Yasur, and the premise follows a pregnant Israeli woman and her relationship to a mysterious gas bill from 1944. But according to Dekel-Avneri, however, the plot of the show is amorphous and much less important than the individual interpretation each audience member draws from the performance. 
“This text is deconstructing the stories and rebuilding them differently,” Dekel-Avneri said. “The most important thing is what is going on here and now in the performance. The energy between the performers themselves, the energy between the performance and the audience. Meaning is being created by transferring from the performance text to the audience’s mind. The meaning is in the middle. There is no stated meaning that you have to get.”
The show, held in the Scene Dock Theatre, was performed on a catwalk-like stage. There were no assigned characters, as each person in the cast was part of a larger chorus that presented each scene.
“You’re really an ensemble member. You don’t have a specific character or anything like that,” said cast member Brittany Dassa, a senior majoring in theatre. “So you’re on stage, totally vulnerable and just needing to be fully present and reacting to whatever’s given to you. So every time we do the show it’s a little bit different, which makes it kind of really magical because you never know what’s gonna happen.”
According to cast member Brett Morachnick, the uniqueness of this show compared to other modern plays is what intrigued the cast. 
“When we first received the scripts over summer, I fell in love with it and knew I had to do it,” said Morachnick, a sophomore majoring in theatre. “It’s so different. It’s unlike any other show I’ve been in before. The script was entirely bullet points and there were no assigned roles, and I thought that was so cool.”
Instead of a structured story, the two-hour performance follows a chain of visual images that range from a solo drag performance by Morachnick to members of the cast wrapped in flags and laying still on the floor. These images use a combination of song, setting, background and props prompting a critical reflection on a multitude of social issues like gender identity, xenophobia and anti-Semitism. 
Dassa said that one of the most personal and powerful scenes is when the entire cast rocks miniature light fixtures and sings a lullaby tune. 
“With the thought of immigration and refugees, there are so many people that get taken away from their children and lose their children in war, and I think that image is touching and it hurts and has so many things to it,” Dassa said.
The audience engagement at the show is something to remember. In one scene, the cast pulls a couple of people from the audience to dance with them. In another scene, the cast hands out sharpies and asks for audience members to write on the performers’ arms. According to Dekel-Avneri, the use of spectators is very deliberate.
“It was important for me that the audience would be a part of the performance — not just sit and watch it like there’s a fourth wall,” Dekel-Avneri said. “While you are being watched also by other audience members, you become a part of the scenery because they see you.”
The performance held Oct. 12 saw generally favorable reactions from the audience, with dispersed cheers throughout the act. One of the spectators, Michaela Skaribas, a freshman majoring in narrative studies, said the show’s strength was its creative entrepreneurship. 
“I thought it was very well done,” Skaribas said. “It was really wonderful to see what they did. Particularly the parts that weren’t in the script, like the lip-syncing and the songs; I thought it really added to the performance.”
The show has three more performances scheduled on Oct. 19 and Oct. 20.

These days, it’s hard to find any common ground between baby boomers and later generations. They have pensions and houses. We have avocado toast and debt. Yet, in one area we are very much in sync: the institutionalized fear of the apocalypse. 
Whereas baby boomers had the Cold War and the simmering dread of nuclear war, we have climate change and the epidemic of mass shootings. I can’t deny that I occasionally Google “how to survive a nuclear apocalypse” when Donald Trump tweets something incendiary toward Iran or North Korea; however, my anxieties now lie much more with the possibility of gun violence in the public spaces that I occupy every day.
Duck-and-cover drills became common in American schools in the early 1950s. With the help of delightful mascot Bert the Turtle, students were instructed to hide under their desks in the event of atomic war. Duck-and-cover drills and a 1951 film inventively titled “Duck and Cover” helped to prepare students for this apocalyptic threat and ease their subsequent anxieties.
Or they were supposed to, at least. Rather, children of that era now discuss the terror these drills instilled in them, exposing the dangerous realities of life from a very young age. It’s hard not to think of today’s children who, in between learning the alphabet and recess, are subjected to hyper-realistic active shooter drills.
These drills are extreme, with police officers at Franklin High School in Ohio firing dozens of shotgun and rifle blanks during a drill and deputies in Indiana shooting teachers with plastic pellets as part of their active shooter training.
Much like the duck-and-cover drills of the past, these active shooter drills are questionably effective and certainly traumatizing. The National Association of School Psychologists found that these lockdowns can produce anxiety, stress and traumatic symptoms in students and staff. 
Despite sensational headlines, school shootings are actually extraordinarily rare. In fact, the likelihood of a public school student being killed by a gun in school is approximately 1 in 614 million. That’s less than a one-in-a-million chance, yet millions of students intensely fear this possibility.
I often wonder how a generation of children that have been raised to fear for their lives in the most sacred places will grow up. Schools, places of worship, movie theaters, parks — what does it do to the psyche to feel such an intense mortal threat in the most ordinary of life’s places? How will the kids who grew up watching their elected officials promise thoughts and prayers but never action vote?
Retroactively examining the major political ideas of baby boomers can help us to understand how future generations, terrorized by threats of gun violence, might think. 
A 2015, and notably pre-Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign, YouGov poll found that 70% of those aged 65 and older viewed socialism unfavorably, compared to 31% of those ages 18 to 29. It’s unsurprising that the older age group would look so unfavorably on socialism, considering its early experiences relying on thin pieces of wood to protect it from communism-induced nuclear Armageddon and the ubiquitousness between these two terms.
A comprehensive study examining the effects of the Cold War on baby boomers’ formative years and their subsequent voting habits does not exist, but it should. Childhood trauma has long-lasting impacts on attachments and relationships, physical health, emotional responses, behavior, cognition, self-concept and future orientation and an annual cost of $103.8 billion.
Maybe today’s kids will grow up to fulfill the paradigm of the Parkland students, becoming passionate activists who fight for change. Or maybe the political inaction they witness in the wake of so much destruction will breed apathy, and we’ll watch already low voting rates drop in the future.
Today’s kids certainly have something past generations didn’t: iPhones in their hands that constantly remind them of all of the threats that they face, exacerbating the development of trauma in a group that is already acutely susceptible.
The issues our society faces currently are intractable. Progress is glacial. Solutions are hard to come by and even harder to agree on. But looking to the past reminds us of how trauma molds our youngest and most at-risk members of society when we allow fear to consume them instead of taking action and protecting them.

On Oct. 2, the School of Cinematic Arts announced that it would consider the removal of a controversial exhibit honoring John Wayne. The announcement came after student protests referred to Wayne as a racist and white supremacist. The protest has gained much media coverage, even getting a headline from conservative media outlet Breitbart News. 
A look into Wayne’s past reveals that he said these very same things about himself, and he has expressed racist, xenophobic and homophobic remarks in numerous interviews. This, coupled with his films’ promotion of the exploitation and murder of Native Americans, makes him undeserving of glorification inside SCA. Instead of promoting Wayne, SCA should use the space to promote the work of prominent filmmakers of color that have graduated from the University.
A Washington Post article from February unearthed an interview with Playboy from 1971 in which Wayne said, “I believe in white supremacy … We can’t all of a sudden get down on our knees and turn everything over to the leadership of the blacks.” 
Later in the interview, Wayne referred to characters in the Academy Award Best Picture-winning film “Midnight Cowboy” with homophobic slurs and said white Americans were justified in taking land from Native Americans. It’s easy to see why protestors would want an exhibit extolling the work of this man removed, especially if they belong to any of the groups that Wayne railed against.
Even when Wayne was alive, actors and protestors were aware of Wayne’s treatment of Native Americans and other underrepresented groups. One of the organizers of USC’s protest, Eric Plant shared a video on Instagram of Native American activist Sacheen Littlefeather, who appeared onstage to formally decline Marlon Brando’s Academy Award as a protest against the treatment of Native Americans in film and America at large. 
An article from The Wrap details that, following her speech, Wayne came backstage to forcibly remove her from the venue. She said that “he had to be restrained by six security men.” Not only did Wayne treat Native Americans poorly in his films, but he was also violently opposed to them crusading for their rights. The University should not be endorsing the legacy of a man who threatened physical violence against a woman crusading for her people’s civil rights.
USC students are not the first to wish Wayne’s name removed from an institution. 
In the past year, numerous op-eds, including one in the Los Angeles Times, called for Wayne’s name to be removed from the Orange County airport, citing numerous examples of his bigotry in Playboy. The article even elicited a response from Wayne’s son in the Orange County Register, claiming that his father was not racist or homophobic, even when faced with such an interview. Since February, no official action has been taken by Orange County to change the name, but this shows how Wayne’s past actions are finally catching up to his legacy.
Even if the exhibit were altered to acknowledge the racist and bigoted parts of Wayne’s past, it would be hard to fully account for his actions. It would be hard for passing observers to fully grasp the full history of Wayne when just walking by, instead seeing an exhibit in SCA glorifying him. It is impossible to expect people to stop and fully take in all the information. Right now, leaving the exhibit up, even in an altered state, would do more to glorify Wayne than it would to educate the public about him.
Instead of keeping the John Wayne exhibit open, SCA and USC should use the space to honor filmmakers of color. 
Shonda Rhimes, showrunner of numerous award-winning shows like “How to Get Away with Murder” and “Grey’s Anatomy”  and Nahnatchka Khan, creator of “Fresh Off the Boat,” are both women of color who attended SCA and are certainly worthy of exhibition. 
These women have dedicated their careers to advancing representations of people of color on screen, and they should certainly be honored over a self-admitted white supremacist. 
The University owes it to its students of color to not glorify a man who has made such hateful and bigoted remarks in the past.
